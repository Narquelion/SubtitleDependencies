Yo, what is that noise.
Ohh.
Yo.
Yo, shut the f*** up.
No way.
No way.
*nice intro*.
Ay yo, good morning logang, what's popping.
It is 6 am we're all pretty tired.
I went to bed 3 hours ago.
Bro i don't know, i'm just, i'm out here bro.
We have quite the day planned, and now that's assuming we get the day started.
We woke up early. well, i woke up early.
And then woke arnie up.
Because we're driving to sequoia national park today.
I honest, i don't know what it is,
I don't know, like, what it looks like,
But i think it's cool, i think there's like trees and snow.
And taking instagram pictures. but. listen, the point is.
This trip is gonna be lit.
Once again, i believe and this is all just assuming, we have like a 3-4 hour drive.
And then, i think we're there, and when i say "we",
I mean me, arnie,
My boy georgie.
And, potentially some other kid.
I'm not sure, but georgie, george janko.
We need to see if this man is up,
And also, look who is up.
That's ma boiii- team no shirt, let's go.
Yo yes, bro, team no shirt.
Why are you up right now. i've gotta ask.
 what do you mean. i always get up this early.
No you did not mark, it's 6 am.
 it's valentine's day, bro.
Yo, your excuses right now are making 0 sense.
Why are you up bro.
 no like, legit i usually get up this early. o.
Wait, really.
 yeah.
Can i tell you something mark.
George texted me and said.
'not feedlong good, gonna pass bro, everything's spinning for me'.
What did you do last night.
I don't know.bro.
We had fun.
 it's good, as long as you had fun.
It's good right.
It's a good time.
Yes so, okay.
George is not coming.
George george george of the jungle.
Oh-ho ho ho.
Oh ho ho ho.
Oh--.
Yeah bro, so, we brought these warm coats.
'cause, apparently it gets cold there. it's snowy right.
I don't know, i don't know any of this.
We're just assuming everything,
Yo, do you think my car's gonna be able to make it up.
I hope so.
Yeah, me too.
Here's a kicker.
I let arnie drive my car because i'm way too tired for this.
Do you feel powerful. do you feel in charge.
.like a man driving this. machine. yo what i was gonna say bro,
When i grab this wheel i'm just like. rawr.
Rawr. apparently it's not just me.
We are on the highway right now.
Look at the school bus. wow.
I'm a little nervous, but, i'm gonna take this opportunity to get some sleep.
The next time you see us, we will either be dead.
Because arnie crashed the car or at sequoia national park.
I'm hoping the latter.
Please don't crash this car while i'm asleep.
Dude, say something to confirm.
I'll try not to.
Reassuring, wow. ok, thanks arnie. sequoia national park,
Here we come.
*guitar music*.
*nice car pulling up with the dab*.
Oh ho ho ho ho ho.
Oh boi.
Echo.
Mom.
Like and subscribe to my youtube channel. you should delete your youtube account.
What. ok, guys. arnie and i made it.
Bro, how was the drive.
It was beautiful, dude. and now we're in, like i've said for the.
5th hundred time. don't know how this park works.
But i know that right now we are in, what is this called.
The giant tree, the big tree, the giant tree forest.
You got it.
Let me tell you, uh, it is named that for a good reason.
That is because the trees are giant.
I bet this does not look that big on camera.
Like these trees are just kind of the mediocre trees.
And no offense guys you're just, i mean you're.
Yeah, kind of just ok.
Hut hut.
Imma put on some hiking boots.
These are freaking nice, yo look how fancy they are.
Arnie has a super intense camera rig as well.
Tell me about the shots that are gonna be captured today arnie.
These shots are gonna be some cinematic movie quality bro.
Cinematic movie quality.
Let's go.
*music*.
So we're just kind of hiking around here.
And across the way we see.
This tree is huge.
Have you ever seen a tree that big.
No i've never seen a tree that big.
Yeah and actually we're just gonna talk about it and not show you guys, sorry.
Ha ha. gotcha.
Thats the tree across the way you guys see. its the orange one right there and my finger is pointing at it.
You guys see it. i'll zoom in in case you don't see it.
You guys see it now.
It's this one right here with this like buttcrack type thing on it.
Yeah, it's, are you guys looking at it.
I'm like, strictly tree butthole right now.
Like, that's me.
*music*.
Oh look. we found another nature butthole.
Im zooming in so you guys can see it.
Can you hear it too.
This butthole makes noise.
Yo thats crazy.
Looking down in there.
Logan what are you doing bro.
Im just, look at the whirlpool dude.
Yo this is me trying to get the whirlpool on video.
Watch, this is gonna be so worth it i promise.
*music.
Ah. its so cold bro.
Aaaaaah.
Oh my god its so good though dude.
We are approaching the big tree.
If you look to your left, you can see this massive guy oh my goodness.
*music*.
This is so cool, dude.
We could literally, honestly, we could live in here.
I think we should ditch our lives, both of us.
And me and you, just live in this tree for the rest of our lives.
Carve it out a little bit,
Yeah, bro.
It's cool cause i mean you can see,
Someone like, had burnt the tree to form this hole i think.
Well, i mean that's not cool.
Cause, deforestation is bad.
I dont know why i said it was cool, it's not cool.
*laughs*.
*music*.
So we're walkig back to the car, and this, this just breaks my heart.
There's just a little shoe here.
You know what this means dude. arnie, some kid died, bro.
There's a dead kid in these, in these mountains.
It means, im not the only one that lost a shoe in the snow.
Arnie lost his shoe, also, why are you wearing these orange,
Like, running shoes bro.
Dude when i came here not realize we be playing in the snow.
Yeah, it doesn't really snow in california ever.
And maybe the kid that died also didn't know that.
R.i.p kid.
And and also vine too.
Ok, so we are going to the next location and i like this.
Place so much that i decided to go on the hood of the car.
And by hood i mean roof sorry i am color blind.
Arnie, how you doing.

He*k yeah bro, yeah this is pretty this is good stuff.
*logan singing*.
*logan singing*.
*logan singing*.
*logan singing*.

Break slow i am sliding i am sliding.
I am sliding.
Ah.
Yeah ok let's do this.
This is absolutely crazy we are in the second location.
They have the largest tree on earth. that's what i was going to say.
The sign in front of us it says "largest tree on earth".
Yo does that seem too good to be true. yeah. how is how is that there is no way there is no way.
This is even bigger that the butthole tree.
Actually mistaken.
