Hey.
Hey, what's going on.
I don't know, franke.
I just haven't been feeling inspired lately.
You go in there.
And you sing from the heart.
30.
Fuck all the haters, that said i couldn't do it.
I said i'd count to 30 and you know i'd fuckin' do it.
I'm that boy.
That's my boy.
And i love to count.
I'm that boy.
That's my boy.
That's my boy.
That's my boy.
That's my boy.
I'm that boy.
That's my fuckin' boy.
That's my boy.
That's my boy.
I'm that boy.
I fuck with you if you say you love to count.
Counting is my favorite and that's what this song's about.
Sing it loud.
And sing it proud.
'cause no this ain't the alphabet, just in case you had a doubt.
It's like.
I saw your face.
When i counted up to 10, you knew it wasn't 30.
My mom's ashamed.
I know if i don't finish, you'll probably disown me.
Is it einstein. is it newton. galileo. maybe uller.
That's giving me this power.
To finish what i started.
'cause i never though that numbers were better.
I could never wrap my head around that letter.
I know i have to follow my .
30.
I fuck with you if you say you love to count.
Counting is my favorite and that's what this song's about.
