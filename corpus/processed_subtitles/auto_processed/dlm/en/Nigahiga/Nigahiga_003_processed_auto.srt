Alright.
Fandom name, group color, new song.
That's all we gotta figure out today. easy.
Why're we doing this again.
That's what we need in order to be a k-pop band.
Says who.
Everyone. the comments, uh, google.
The hell's a fandom name.
A fandom name is basically what the fans call themselves.
Right.
Y'know like,
Justin bieber's fans are called beliebers.
Uhm, don't we all ready have a fandom name.
The bga army.
According to the comments,
That's already taken by some other group called, like,
"behind the scenes" or whatever.
Well, since our first and only song is about poop.
Again, thank you for that david.
What.
Maybe sumthin like uh.
K-poopers.
Yeah.
Yeah, that makes sense.
I don't care.
That's pretty cool, but uhm.
Do you think the fans would like being called poopers. well,
Fuck yea.
Uhm, okay.
Yeah, most of the fans are girls and girls like poop jokes so.
Cool. alright, we got our fandom name.
Uh, next thing on the list.
We got group color.
I'm just gonna throw it out there.
I personally like silver.
I could do silver.
Right.
But that's like, second place.
What.
Gold is first, silver is second.
*snaps fingers* gold, gold tho.
I look good in gold, ya know what i'm sayin'.
Y'know, you know what i mean.
No. no, i don't know what you are saying.
So what color do you wanna choose.
Gold.
Oh, me too.
Okay, we have two for gold, two for silver.
Jun, be our tie-breaker.
I'm- i'm fine with either.
Yes, so which one do you prefer.
Yeah, which one is better, gold or silver.
Obviously gold, right.
Don't you dare convince him.
Pick one, you idiot.
C-can we do both.
Yeah, i don't see why not.
Actually, i've never really thought of that before.
Yeah, i've never seen two colors.
Yeah, we could have, like, the glowsticks that k-pop groups have.
Like, a silver and gold option.
Yeah, and then we could have our logos like "bga" or sumthin' like that.
Oh god, that is the dumbest idea ever.
Silver and gold doesn't even go together.
Who's gonna buy these glowsticks.
I'm not putting my money in for that garbage, man.
Look, y'know what. we'll just come back to it 'cuz it's not that important.
What we really need to figure out.
New song.
We've haven't had a song since last year.
Well whatever it's about, i better get some lines in this one because you took all the lines last time.
Obviously. i'm the leader.
*scoffs*.
You're the leader. are you kidding me. i'm obviously the lead.
Have you not read my twitter feed. they all say so.
Have you read the comments. you're like everybody's least favorite.
Yeah, because you hog all the lines.
Okay, i'm pretty sure jun is everyone's least favorite.
I don't care about being the leader. i just better be higher than jun, 'kay.
I think i'm about the second place 'cuz i like silver.
What, silver. you just said that you like gold.
Now you're flip-flopping but all of a sudden.
*random gibberish*.
Alright, alright.
Okay.
We're not gonna get anywhere like this.
There's only one way of figuring out who the leader is.
How.
We make a song, with everybody in it, equally.
And then we just see what happens.
Okay but what's the song gonna be about.
Exactly what we've been talking about the entire time.
Who's it gonna be.
Oh. my. god.
That better not be the name of the song.
That is so chees-.
*song starts*.
K-poopers, where you at.
Bga.
Let's go.
*door opens*.
Jun. is that really you.
Wait, what are you guys doing.
Why do you look like that.
Look man. we're happy for you.
We really are.
But, ever since you left the group.
It's been really tough for the rest of us.
Yeah, we've just been doing what we all can to get by.
But, it's only been one week.
Oh.
Well, it's been a really tough week.
Yeah yeah, seven days, long time.
Why are you even talking to this traitor.
He left us.
You. left. us.
We know all about your talking to the manager and your little contract.
So why are you even here.
Actually.
That's exactly why i'm here.
This pretty much guarantees me fame, money and everything that we've been working for together as a group.
But it says i have to do it alone, without you guys.
Which is why i felt the need to come here and. do this.
What's the point of fame and fortune if it's not with your guys.
Dude.
The hell were you thinking, man.
What.
Yeah, you could have taken the money and shared it with us.
Why would you even rip this man. come on.
What're we gonna do now.
Do you think we can put this back together or what.
Like, if we could tape it.
Glue. i have some glue in the car.
Do you. okay, then let's try to see if we have all the pieces like.
Hey.
Are those- *shocked* - are those the glowsticks.
Told you. gold and silver.doesn't match.
Tch, idiot.
Aah, aah.
Aaand it's--- sign sign sign sign. sign right here.
Sorry guys, it's-it's gone.
There. it's good. let it go.
Guys, it's in my email, i could print it out.
You're so--- *smacks*.
Teehee.
