You challenged us to turn our house into a real.
Life candyland and were kicking it off with.
Makin a candy garden. we've got a whole bunch of.
Melted down gummy bears in here that we're going.
To be coating, here this one is you ready.
You ready. here we go.
Both 3,2,1.
You blew it bro, are you kidding me.
This is a college moment.
You got it on my face. it's gonna stain my nose.
I know, we've got to get this off.
That took forever to clean up and it has.
Literally stained everything.
Got a new uh, a new gummy bear.
I do man.
What happened to your old one.
It kind of popped in the process unfortunately.
So now i've got the melted down gummy bears.
And i'm gonna fill in this giant gummy bear.
So now i'm gonna be making some soda soaked watermelon.
So basically you take a soda thing like this,
Open up. no. no.
Whoa, whoa.
No. get in there.
Wow.
Basically the goal here is you want the soda.
To soak all through the watermelon, really.
Permeate the juices.
Wait, is this how we make a purple watermelon kong.
Get it deep in there.
Dude, you have to warn me.
I don't have to warn you, devan, it's not in.
The contract.
Well then, i don't have to make this really.
Cool gummy bear tree.
See this is different,
You don't make a cool gummy bear tree.
You will get flamed in the comments.
So light this man up.
I would not say that.
You might actually light me up in the comments.
All right so don't light him up in the comments.
All right so collins i'm gonna need your help.
To hold this gummy bear.
Got up into the goop on my hands.
So i can't quite put my gloves on properly.
Wanna drop it in.
Yeah i'm ready man.
Drop a load.
Here we go.
Yup. yup there we go i'm doing a great job devan.
Oh. come on. come on.
Think thin streams.
I can't see it.
It just drenched me dude.
I'm not doing as good a job.
I think we got it man.
All right.
I'll help, i'll help.
All right well i just have to fill this thing up entirely,
And next up i'm making a strawberry but with an apple.
So let me do that and then i'll be right back.
All right next we're gonna empty out the watermelon.
And turn it sour.
Devan all right i have everything i need.
To turn these apples into strawberries.
I'm coating it in this nice melted chocolate here,
So i can attach these jolly ranchers.
We're gonna use a drill here to.
Chop up the inside of the watermelon.
So here- this thing really scares me man.
Okay so here we go.
I feel like a rockstar in a way.
Wait what. what rockstar does that.
Oh. we blasted the ceiling bro look at that.
We. we. we.
You and i.
As a duo. as a dynamic duo.
All right, so now, i have to attach.
These jolly ranchers on the top.
All right here we go,
So we're gonna take the chunks out.
And just drop them in here.
Basically hollowing out the watermelon,
It's not working.
Whoa.
Dude, look. it actually looks pretty cool.
There we go.
It's going in here, flippin' scooping it out.
Scoop-da-da-doop.
Doo-doo-poo-poo-pa.
I gotta say i love being outside.
I am fully uninhibited to be my greatness.
Wow.
This literally feels no different than inside to me.
Next up, it's time for me to make.
The sour insides of the watermelon.
So, i melted down a whole bunch of.
Sour patch watermelon over here.
So now, i'm going to drench all the actual watermelon.
In the sour patch watermelon.
All right, so, i finally have half of it coated.
I separated some yellow "nerds" here, and.
These are gonna be the seeds of the strawberry.
If you could just hold the actual watermelon for me.
I'm gonna dump this in.
I can.
So if you wanna grab the actual watermelon, it's.
Right over the-.
Yeah, okay. what.
You checking your nails.
This just in, youtube star,
Devan key checks his nails.
So lift up that water- holy cow, this is heavy.
Ugh, this is heavy.
All right, lot of heavy stuff.
Is it going in.
Yup. oh, yup yup yup.
Is it going in.
It's splashing a little bit but it's going in.
It's very chunky are you supposed- th-th-that's it.
Is it going in. is it full.
Pull back, pull back.
It's full.
Yes it's very full.
Oh wow, that is very full.
The last thing you gotta do is.
Add a beautiful mirror glaze.
To the exterior of my watermelon.
Let me grab that real quick.
Ugh. whoa whoa.
I'm sorry i didn't mean that.
Its all good.
For the strawberry stem, i'm actually gonna use.
These fruit roll-ups.
Time to add a mirror glaze.
It's gonna look so satisfying.
All right here we go,
Both 3,2,1. whoa.
Collins man.
Devan nice.
Collins dude.
Devan it looks so cool coming out of the container too.
Collins it looks so beautiful.
All right, gloves are coming off.
So this thing now, just has to set here.
It's time to head back inside.
To make the rest of the candy garden.
Lets do it.
We got all the elements for the edible garden.
Bro, that gummy bear, like, what happened.
It's very interesting.
Bro, it's like 40 pounds.
All right well here is the big reveal.
Both 3,2,1. ta da.
Collins look at these, man.
These are just a few examples, of all the things.
We're gonna be adding into the candy garden.
For the massive candy room.
And we'll be eating that at the end of the video.
For the next part of candyland.
It's time for us to make a real life edible candy circus.
We got the yeet hammer and a carnival game.
Let's give this a shot.
Ah.
And that is why i don't go to circuses man.
All right, right now, let's get into it.
To start off, i'm making a jello slushy.
Collins what is that. what is that.
No, no, no.
I'm battering you up, devan. you look great.
To be clear, i am making a funnel cake ice cream sandwich.
So i put the batter here in this squirt gun.
That wasn't clear at all. - that wasn't clear.
No.
All right. so right now, it is time.
To make some funnel cakes for real though.
So we're gonna place the safety glasses on.
I got my hot jello here, i got some dry ice in here.
So now i'm gonna pour that in here the goal is to freeze it.
And make it look awesome.
Collins that does look pretty awesome.
The way it's just steaming up.
And you're probably thinking.
How on earth are you gonna make a jello slushy.
Actually, devan i was thinking.
How on earth are you gonna make a jello slushy.
Oh my gosh, i'm glad you asked.
Don't touch me.
Let's keep it cordial.
6 feet distance.
6 feet apart.
Not because of the quarantine,
There was another incident that happened.
Yeah, it was that.
Devan, get me down.
Yeah.
All right so here we go, i've got.
A whole bunch of batter here in this.
Lovely cooking thing.
I don't know what the thing's called i don't garden.
So here we go, let's just do a little pour.
Both oh.
That's hot.
You're deep frying it.
Yeah we're deep frying it.
That's how we make a funnel cake.
Just step back a little bit, and then just.
Ahhh, that's not good.
This is not good.
Turn this off real quick.
Also wanna mention.
Do not try this at home.
We are trained professionals.
Well we're not trained. we're professionals.
Yeah.
How's your jello slushy coming along.
It's not going great.
But it's gonna work, you know.
It's gonna work.
So i'm actually just gonna pull it out.
I'm not even gonna flip it.
Cause that would be a terrible idea.
Then underneath it that thing's resilient, boom.
Wow. that's cool.
Funnel cake.
Whoa, look at this dude, it's bubbling up.
Collins it's just a couple bubbles man.
It was cool. i mean, come on.
It had no bubbles before, and then it had bubbles.
That's cool.
Collins next up, gonna make some colorful funnel cake.
Whoa yeah.
Whoa yeah.
Okay well there we go we've got color number 1.
We're gonna go two colors simultaneously, boom.
Devan you've got it too high again bro.
Yeah i got it just a smidge high.
I think that's too much, bro.
I think that is way too much.
Purple protestants.
No dude. i think that's too much.
Yeah i guess you're right, here i go.
Purple from a distance, boom.
Yeah i guess you're right,
Let me just do it anyway.
All right that's definitely a great band name.
Purple. from a distance.
They only sell back row seats.
Fun fact, they're actually back there.
You zoom in, at a distance.
Time to get out my second funnel cake.
I don't know if you can call this, like, a funnel cake.
It looks more like, just like a patty almost.
Oh. yeah it's crumbling.
Devan that is a little bit weird.
Gonna move it down over here like this.
Let's see it does a little plop, okay,
There we go.
Funnel crumble.
The first part of my ice cream sandwich is done.
So funnel cake. and now it's time to make some.
Delicious popcorn, that's gonna go around.
The outside of the ice cream.
All right so we've got the funnel cake right here.
I've got the popcorn which will be kind of like.
The topper on top of it.
I filled up the super soaker.
With a whole bunch of ice cream.
You wanna feel it, to confirm it's cold.
It is cold.
All right so here's the deal.
We're gonna add the ice cream on here.
Because that's how they do it.
At all circuses and carnivals.
So here we go.
Both 3,2-.
Wait 3 second like challenge.
We want you to like this video.
In 3 seconds, you ready.
Here we go.
Both 3,2,1, done.
Holy cow, it got the squeaks.
Oh, oh there's something hanging out of it.
Oh jeez.
Think if it was chocolate ice cream.
That would be uh, that would be a little bit bad.
Well i need to pour this cereal.
Into the liquid nitrogen here.
The reason this is called dragon's breath.
Cereal is because when you put it in your mouth-.
Whoa.
Let me try it again, let me try it again.
Both 3,2,1.
Oh. there you go.
Yeah. there you go.
All right well i've got the actual tub.
Of ice cream here so now its time to add.
All the actual ice cream.
Oh man this is a weak little thing.
So this was my topper to my slushy so i'm gonna-.
What are you doing.
I'm doing it with my hands.
Well i'm gonna take this here.
And i'm gonna pour this.
Ow. finger freeze.
Devan just look at this though.
My hands so cold.
I look at that and it kind of triggers me.
Because my hands are so cold at the same time.
That that's so cold.
This is definitely colder than your hand, collins.
I can tell you that.
You wanna feel my hand.
I don't.
It is time to deep fry some twinkies.
And some snickers.
All right so speaking of stuff that's been fried.
I've got my funnel cakes over here.
I'm gonna pop this on top of the ice cream.
Dude, that got soggy.
Yeah it did. - that got a little soggy.
I don't need you to rub it in devan.
So here's the thing, i've also got my popcorn.
That got soggy.
This cuts me at a very deep level it hurts.
All right so gonna add some popcorn down over here.
All right here we go gonna pick it up like this.
And then,
Those weren't even any words.
So we're gonna take this we're gonna pack it.
On the outside over here like this.
And again this is gonna be for my freak shake.
Because devan's making his own freak shake.
My freak shakes gonna be even freakier than devan's.
Nah no chance.
Yeah man got the freakiest of the freak shakes.
It's gonna be freaky fresh.
Well mine's gonna be freaky.
Mine's gonna be freaky.
Well mine's gonna be freaky.
Mine's gonna be.
Now that i've got my twinkies.
And my snickers all skewered.
I'm gonna dip it into this colored batter here.
So, boom.
And now, i deep fry it.
Look at that, man. look at that.
Where'd you go.
I just got a little scared cause like.
You stuck it in the oil right when i arrived.
I've got a large chunk of ice here.
We're gonna be setting this down.
I've also got some dry ice.
Using some shaved ice as the base of my freak shake.
So i've gotta shave up some ice now.
Are those the twinkies.
These are the snickers in the funfetti.
Oh, dude, that's gonna like melt the chocolate.
Oh. that actually sounds lowkey really delicious.
Uh huh.
Devan turn the ice upside down.
It looks like he has hair now.
I think its the dry ice it, like,
Froze all the water around it.
So now let's get some shaved ice.
3,2,1. i've been waiting to use this thing.
Oh yeah.
All right here we go, 3, 2, 1 oh.
My feet are cold, it got on my feet.
Well that definitely got us some shaved ice man.
I even looked away, i couldn't look.
I was like it's gonna be too crazy.
Look at this bro, it's totally different.
Than what you're doing.
But its very cool stuff.
Is it a glaze.
Yes, here we go.
Both 3,2,1. oh.
Awe man.
Yeah.
Maybe go back over it a little bit.
You probably shouldn't actually listen to me.
Cause i'm terrible at this kind of stuff but-.
Devan whoa.
Collins whoa. that looks awesome dude that's sweet.
I am very proud of myself, this looks awesome.
I did have a small suggestion that could've helped out.
Good job.
Thank you very much.
All i gotta do is just collect.
A bunch of the shaved ice i made.
With my giant yeet hammer and then.
That'll be the base of my freak shake.
Then i gotta add some flavoring to it.
All right time to make the flavor for my shaved ice.
Devan my trusty steed has arrived.
You're your own trusty steed.
These are my trusty steeds collins.
Ah, yes. very reliable.
These legs don't need any steed.
I'm making a straw man barbell.
And i'm using these for the weights on either end.
What are you doing.
I'm making the flavor for my freak shake, man.
My freaky shake.
Devan so i have some royal icing here.
That i'm gonna fill, oh, that's cool.
And this is gonna get really hard and solid,
Sorry collins were you trying to say something.
Yep.
The blueberries are n the cloth right now.
And not it's time to get the juice out.
And this is gonna be the flavoring.
So here we go.
You're leaking so much of it, man.
I know.
All right now time to smash the berries.
 3,2,1, ah.
There we go.
Devan look at that.
Collins this is totally failing.
That's actually really awesome dude.
I'm actually very much into this right now.
That's gonna be absolutely delicious.
Well i need to make one more of these.
And this is totally not working so i'll be right back.
All right while he does that we're gonna add.
The raspberries in here cause the show don't stop.
Just squeeze these in here, oh man.
All right for the topping i have some.
Condensed milk here which should freeze on impact.
Devan oh yeah.
Oh.
Devan that was like one of your greatest creations.
How is it, that right when i'm about to.
Get something that looks cool.
I screw it up.
Well i made two of these things.
And then i also made this nice taffy.
Candy cane right here.
Taffy.
Yeah and if you look at it.
It's like a barbell.
Next up i have to glaze it. you ready.
You ready. here we go, 3, 2, 1.
Oh that's gonna look so nice.
Oh it's like a hydro-dip, an edible hydro-dip.
Spin it, lift it, oh.
I'm out. i'm done.
Look at that thing.
I'm outta here.
Are you actually leaving.
Well we have to take a- ah come on.
Come on.
I'm so sorry for you.
It just squeezed out all the pulpiness.
I'm gonna find a way to fix this but i think.
We've got everything we need.
For a candy circus.
We've got all the circus candy and these.
Turned out absolutely amazing.
Oh yeah.
These look so delicious, dude.
Your freak shake looks incredible i have to say.
It's freaky for sure, and so is yours man.
Plus the barbell.
Everything is on point so here is the big reveal.

Collins yeah these freaky shakes.
We're gonna be adding these.
To the massive candy room.
And eating it all at the end of the video.
Next up i am making the flower to my lily pad.
But first i need some strawberries.
Fresh back from the market.
With a cart full of strawberries.
Are you kidding.
Those were over there.
Why did you grab this.
And scene.
Here's what we're gonna do devan.
We're gonna get a close up shot of the cart,
It's moving at lightning speed.
It hits a bump, oh no. strawberries flying.
Smeared on the ground. who's in the cart.
Tiny devan.
No. not me.
First thing i've gotta do for my edible rock.
Is use these 3 musketeers bars.
Three. musket. tears.
The goal here is to separate the chocolate.
From the moo-sket.
Nougat.
And that's again for the edible rock.
So here we go. oh, that's actually kinda-.
Wait, you're making edible rocks with a koi pond.
Yeah. - nice, all right.
Why'd you start off laughing at me man.
Well i just didn't think you were serious.
Does this face look not serious to you.
What are you doing.
I don't know.
Devan all right i've got my strawberries cut up.
And now i have to mash them.
All right guys time to separate the nougat.
I've gotta say, it doesn't- hey.
Don't be touching my nougat.
If you take away the squareness of it-.
Order.
Order in the court.
You're smashing some berries.
I am, but i'm also calling order in the court.
This is for your ice cream.
Yes, i'm adding this in here.
It's actually for my lily pad-.
Collins whoa. -devan what.
Strawberry juice. what-t-t-t.
Are you planning on doing with that strawberry juice.
Putting it in here.
No give it to me.
No.
Devan give it to me.
Devan look at this, if i take this one nougat.
Why are you so amazed by this.
Oh no. - yes.
Oh don't tell me.
You know where it's going.
I do.
It's a massive log.
You can't deny the logness of this log.
I can't. nor do i want to.
Exactly, so here the deal, with this log.
You can do things like poke devan in the ear.
No.
It made slight contact.
First i need to add some milk.
So i'm gonna do that.
I need to turn this blender thingy on, the mixer.
Collins be careful, we have real liquid nitrogen right here.
Oh snap. you gonna make ice cream.
Yes.
Don't try this at home by the way.
Do you have anything else to say collins.
Carole baskins.
Okay.
Collins i'm very scared. no. that's not working.
Devan yes it is.
What are you talking about devan.
Leave bro.
I don't.
Hey. that's starting to look.
Real weird.
Don't look at it right now.
Collins i'm looking at it and it scared me.
Give me like 2 hours and i'll get it right.
I've seen some things.
Oh yes bro, look at this.
I mean it is kind of cool.
You used liquid nitrogen to make ice cream from scratch.
But now, it's time for me to turn.
This little ball into a rock.
Here we go.
Reverse wand.
I have some marshmallow fluff.
And i'm making the bowls that the ice cream.
Is gonna go in, for the bulb of the flower, of the lily pad.
I'm pretty sure i misheard you there, you're doing what.
So i'm making the bulb of the flower,
For the lily pad, and i'm making a bowl.
That this ice cream goes in.
Yeah i'm thoroughly lost.
Now i combine the marshmallow fluff.
With these fruity pebbles right here.
Hold up the fruity pebbles man.
Batter up.
You lost it it's over there.
I lost my rock. truce, bam.
Its a little.
Is it the marshmallow fluff.
It is.
You just gotta do a magic trick.
I don't do magic tricks anymore.
What do you mean.
I'm a youtuber now.
All right here we go so we're gonna charge up,
Hey it worked. we're detached.
But at what cost.
Don't worry i saw it in a marvel movie so it.
Can't be that bad right.
What is this doing here.
That's just my log. probably shouldn't touch that.
Are you sure that's not mine.
You might've lost it in flight.
Devan so now i've got the fruity pebbles here.
Collins and its time for me to coat this again.
In chocolate.
We're gonna pop this into the fridge.
It's gonna mold it a little bit better.
And then it's on to the next part of the koi pond.
Lots of dough. what were you about to say.
I was gonna say the first thing i'm making.
For my giant oreo is the filling on the inside.
Got some dry ice here as well as a slab of marble.
While i've got the filling contained.
In this here siphon.
So this time i'm gonna do this.
Suspended, mission impossible style.
You have socks on dude. what are you doing.
Whoa. if i wasn't here it would've been all over me.
Yeah like me.
Yeah. surprise innovation. i'm just ahead of my time.
All right so here we go we're just gonna get- oh.
Look at that ice cream bro look at that.
That's awesome.
Game changing, man.
Oh this is gonna be so delicious.
Well i've got this all rolled out and now.
I've made some stencils here for the lily pad.
Just gonna kinda cut this out here. oh.
Collins that looks really good man.
Devan yes. and for the next part of the lily pad.
I made a smaller outline here, cut it out, then.
Gonna fill it with these jolly ranchers.
Next up time to make the cookie part of the oreo.
So we've got the dough over here.
We've got some 7-up as a rolling pin.
Wait what. what's the oreo for.
Sorry i should've mentioned.
The oreos actually gonna be like stepping stones.
Leading up to the koi.
So when we fill up the whole room-.
Whoops, you need some flour.
Yeah you're very right.
Here you go, i just did this.
Here we go, let's see if we just did this.
That's not some flour.
That's a little bit of flour.
Not some flour.
Yeah.
You just gotta roll it out. calmly. calmly.
This is calm. - no it's not.
Are you kidding me.
I'm sorry.
Here we go, gonna plop this down in here like that.
Hey look, we're twins.
We're doing the same exact thing, we're not twins though.
What are you doing.
Double high-fiving.
This is a lot of status here.
A lot of status.
Yeah, this is how you achieve clout.
So i'm just gonna pop these things into the oven.
Yeah okay hold on, hold on.
I wait for no one.
Hold on. we're gonna do it together.
Okay here we go, why did you, you went in first.
How rude.
Perfect.
Gonna pop these in.
All right so we got these things out of the oven.
There we go, fully got them.
And they are now exposed.
And these are actually two halves of one lily pad.
What are you doing.
I'm using a ouija that you usually use.
To clean your window.
I'm repurposing it to use it for my oreos.
Squeegee bro not ouija.
It's not a ouija.
I don't think so.
I think its a ouija.
I'm pretty sure it's a squeegee.
We got all the elements let's see how this looks.
Here is the big room reveal, let's see,
Both 3, 2, 1. ta da.
Collins look at this.
Hands down the craziest thing we have ever done.
I feel like i'm in a dream right now, dude, holy cow.
Dude its all edible like literally we can eat everything.
From the rocks to the grass.
I know.
Next we have time to harvest the fruits.
Of our labor from our candy garden.
Oh yes.
These strawberries need to be freed,
These carrots are in captivity.
Devan what do you mean.
In this cage so.
This is a fence.
Sweet tricks.
No. no collins. stop.
That's on you man i was doing sweet tricks.
First lets pop this little rose right outta here.
So, devan.
Wait i need mine.
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm the bachelor, you're the lady on the show.
Do you accept my final rose.
I think they do it on the bachelor.
And the bachelorette.
I'm the bachelor i'm not the bachelorette clearly.
Well in that case i'm also the bachelor.
Do you accept my final rose.
No will you accept my final rose.
Do you accept my final rose.
I think you wanna choose mine.
Think you want this rose right here.
This rose. will you accept my rose.
All right lets just take a bite of it 3, 2, 1.
Oh.
Both mmm.
Wow.
What would've happened.
I need some sprinkles.
Wow. 1010 phenomenal man, i accept this rose.
You gotta try the rock.
Oh yeah, this is kinda like take it and break it so,
I forgot that's glass.
That's our table bro.
I'm an idiot.
Just eat it i wanna try this.
Did you just take a bite of that thing.
Mhmm.
Your teeth are stronger than glass.
There you go.
Yeah see there's layers to this on the inside.
So here we go,
I'm gonna take my bite over here from this wack lump.
I mean this is actually very good.
He next thing we gotta eat of course.
Are these delicious edible strawberries.
Here's the thing, i appreciate the attention to detail.
We put in it, it looks like its growing from the ground.
We. we.
Well you kinda helped with some of the stuff.
What. i made this entirely.
Rewriting history, see how it is.
It is what it is.
So here we go, take a- pluck a strawberry.
Both 3, 2, 1.
That's what i thought would happen.
Soft ground collins, soft ground.
Okay there we go.
Mmm. that's so good.
I'm good.
I don't think we've done enough damage.
Here at the candy gardens so now.
We're onto the next part.
Sorry man.
Let's put this worm back in the dirt.
And let's eat some more candy.
I've had my eye on this giant gummy bear.
From the very beginning.
It looks so good man.
He looks good to you collins.
Yeah well i- he looks a little funky.
He is a little messed up, his face is all like,
Squished in.
Okay hold on, here, here , here.
Collins he's heavy.
