You challenged us to make slime, out of pumpkin guts.
Pumpkin.
Together oh.
Right now, let's go.
To kick things off, we have to gut out the pumpkin,
So i'm gonna use this carving tool right here.
And, i'm gonna use victor, the laser pony.
It's super complicated to get it started,
But i just got to figure out the initiation process here.
Do you have to figure it out.
This sounds dangerous bro.
How do you do it. - it's actually.
Super difficult, you basically have to press here.
Three, two, one.
Both whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa.
Now, it's time to ride off into the sunset.
Which way is the sun.
Victor, which way.
This way.
Woo hoo.
All right, now it's time to remove the tops.
Dude what, no, no, no, no, no.
You remove it.
Oh. - look at that bro.
Dude, looks like a weird, like chunky kind of jellyfish.
All right, i think i've got to snip out some.
Whoa, jeez it's like a witch's broom.
Yo, this is a real flying broomstick,
Dude it's the dingus 2000.
Wow.
Now with built in air wifi.
I can actually fly with no video tricks.
Check this out.
Whoa, dude are you okay, bro.
Oh, man.
Oh no, i broke my dingus.
It's fine.
Alright, now it is time to carve this out right now,
So let's, get in here and let's get juicy.
I'm just going in with my hands,
So let's see how this feels.
It's like the weird reverse of slime almost.
Mine's fully gutted.
Next step is to make the pumpkin slime,
So we're going to take this clear glue here,
And add it into our pumpkin guts.
I've never done this before, it's gonna be weird.
Pumpkin purification first,
Booga, booga, booga.
Now, i just have to heat up my glue,
So to do this i'm going to bring back victor,
The laser pony.
But, now i have to dial it back, i don't want laser mode,
So i'm just going to dial back the laser eye,
And again i'm going to press here.
Done, and now we can add it in, so here we go,
Just gonna dump it in.
Time to go in with the hands.
Oh.
Stop, flow, in.
Perfect.
Alright, first off we're gonna go in with.
A little skeleton dude, see what he thinks of it.
You ready.
Hey, what man.
Watch the bones.
Oh, you are not joking, bro, this feels super crazy.
Yeah, i added way, way, way too much.
Of everything into this thing dude.
No.
Just listen to those sounds.
Now it's time to add the slime, to the pumpkin.
Okay, here we go, almost getting it in, oh snap.
Why did i make my hole so small.
Now it's time to seal off the top, like this, perfect.
Like a glove.
Now it's time to carve it out, and watch the slime ooze.
Starting with the eyes first.
Well, that's not going to work, so, fleet.
I wonder if the slime is going to come pouring out.
This'll be nuts.
I'm we're just gonna go for the eyeballs now.
Ooh, it's starting to happen.
Oh, not really any slime at all.
Ooh, ooh, it's happening.
Adding the mouth is really where it's going to happen,
So here we go.
I don't know how to carve the mouth.
Alright, my mouth is done.
Dude, it might literally, explode out of this thing.
You ready.
Both three, two, one.
Yo.
It came right out.
Oh my gosh, it's just going, and going, and going.
Wait, is yours not out yet.
No, in three, two, one.
Both oh.
Dude, keep it in.
Try to keep it in.
Bro, control yourself bro, control your bladder,
Or stomach, or whatever this is, this is not a bladder,
I don't know how pumpkin's anatomy works.
You get to comment down below who made a crazier pumpkin,
And right now guys we are on to the next round.
Check this out.
Whoa, nice.
Ah, jeez. - right now,
We're gonna show you how to make some poppers, what.
Oh no, let's go.
First off, we need ice.
Whoa, wait, what, no.
Here we go, we just need some ice.
We need dry ice.
Don't worry i got you, here we go.
No, dude that's not how you make dry ice, bro.
Yeah, i'm drying the ice off bro, this is a dryer.
Yeah, i guess we don't need the dryer anymore so, deet.
Oh, collins, this is not what we need.
Well, maybe if it's in smaller pieces.
No, no, that makes no sense.
Close your eyes, and trust me.
I don't trust you.
You pinky promise me you're not going to do anything bad.
Nothing bad.
Oh, jeez.
Now, you put on your protective gloves.
Got it.
No, they're not gloves.
Fleet, fleet.
Dude, this stuff is no joke.
Dry ice is serious business,
And if you need somebody's help,
Make sure to ask them, and wear protective gloves.
Yes, do not touch this stuff with your bare hands.
Dude, it's steaming.
Oh, it's already smoking.
So, next up, you grab a mallet, and break it.
Now, this is the size piece you want.
Oh, snap.
What are you doing.
Dude, it's like an iceberg.
Dude, it looks kind of looks like a jellyfish,
Blowing through the ocean, just chilling.
It's like, aye.
Well, guys i got my container,
So i'm gonna pop the top off like that, alright, perfect.
So now-.
First up you add the water.
Add the water.
Pour the water in, get your top ready,
Because you're gonna need it.
Alright, so i guess we're gonna put this in,
And it's going to pop off in the count of three.
Yeah, i think that's too big, bro.
What.
I'm trying to go for a crazy pop off, bro, here we go.

Where we try to pop this thing thingy,
Into the top of that thing.
Basically, we take these caps,
And we try to get them into there.
That's it.
That's the game.
First player to get a top in wins the game.
Let me see if i can get this.
Both oh.
Oh man, i didn't get it.
You can't even aim them.
Both oh.
So close. - that was so close.
No.

Race announcer and there you have it, folks,
Collins winning, one to zero.
Devan, not having it.
You shoulda used this one bro,
That's your losing thing.
That's what you get for losing.
What's a losing thing.
It's a losing,
Oh, dude.
Alright guys, well that is it for this round,
You get to comment down below,

You challenged us to make monster eyeballs out of slime,
That glow in the dark, so check this out, bro.
Turn off the lights.
Turn on the lights.
Turn on the lights, bro.
Turn on the lights.
Dude, oh my goodness.
You're back to normal now.
I was glowing in the dark.
No, you were a scary clown, bro.
No way.
I think you're seeing things.
Alright, well right now here is how you make 'em.
First off we've got to make a slime type process.
Those are, we needed those.
I'll throw a little eyeball at you.
Ah.
We've got some glue we've got to add.
Yo, this reminds me of a quick draw from a western movie.
What are you even doing, bro.
What are you talking about, boy.
Oh, jeez.
Queue the tumbleweed.
The what.
The tumbleweed.
Well, you have one major weakness.
Yeet.
That's my hair.
Hey, it landed perfectly.
I've added my two parts glue, now it's time for.
One part cornstarch.
We got to straighten it out first.
A little armpit grab, you know just, grip it.
Why do you strain everything.
This is crazy.
I can't concentrate while my armpit squeeze is on point.
Alright, it's getting strained out.
Glue's slipping.
Devan, grab the glue.
Dude.
You didn't even help me at all.
I thought you had better grip strength, bro.
Oh, snap.
I'm turning you back into, tiny devan.
No, no.
It's a little extreme. - three, two, one, poof.
Ha, didn't work again.
Dude, what did you do this time.
Bro.
Fix this.
Easy, i can fix this,
Hold out your arm, hold out your arm.
Three, two, one.
Oh, man.
Dude, they're not even even anymore.
Devan, devan, devan, stay with me.
Oh, my gosh you're heavy.
Three, two, one.
You just did the same exact thing.
I'm sorry devan, these are not turning out.
I'm just going to pop them back in.
Three, two, one.
Oh my gosh, devan, i am so sorry,
I am gonna change you back right now, i am so sorry.
Here we go.
Three, face forward, two, one.
Dude, what happened.
I feel like i kind of blacked out.
Dude, i kinda remember skeleton hands,
Or something, i don't know.
Okay, we're adding some cornstarch right now,
Maybe a little bit more glue,
And then time to mix this whole thing around.
No, no, no, two parts glue, one part cornstarch.
That's two parts, bro, here we go.
That's like four parts glue, really.
That's not effective.
Hey, it looks kind of like santa clause now.
No, he's like a scary dude.
Next you add the food coloring.
Now it's time to mix it up.
Alright, here we go, i got the top off.
We're just gonna add some neon yellow into this thing,
'cause these are gonna be glow in the dark.
Alright, that should be good.
Next up, we got some borax.
So, we're just going to add this into a bowl right now,
This stuff is hard to work with.
Oh no, i forgot it's my megaphone.
Hello.
Alright, that's enough of that.
Alright, so now we're going to add some water in.
How much water.
That much.
I got glue on my lip.
What's the next step, collins.
The next step, devan,
Is to use a surprisingly heavy trumpet.
Haha.
Next up, we're going to add the slime into the borax,
And this is where we turn it into the balls.
Dump it in like this, so here we go.
That looks so crazy.
Wow.
Yo, it like, turned into slime immediately.
It's actually turning harder, bro.
I know it's almost turning into a bouncy ball consistency.
This is like a homemade diy bouncy ball, bro.
Have you done the bounce test yet.
No.
Both in unison three, two, one.
Alright, it's back.
Alright, here we go.
So, to pass the test, it's time to add it into here.
So, here we go, i'm just going to put it into here, like-.
Alright, i'm just going to squish it in like this.
Ball number one is done.
Yo, these things turned out so cool, and they.
Literally bouncing where's devan at.
No. it's tiny devan.
Okay, tiny devan, try to catch the ball, are you ready.
Three, two, one.
No, no, no, no.
Oh my gosh, i smacked his face.
Right now we are on to the next round.
Oh my gosh, yo, tiny devan, you got to relax, bro.
You challenged us to make elephant toothpaste.
And i've got the toothbrush.
Wait, what, is that for an elephant.
Yeah.
There's no elephants in this video.
What.
Yeah, it's just really big toothpaste.
Well, i've got some regular toothpaste,
Right now, let's go.
Oh, direct hit.
Safety goggles on, and do not try this at home.
So, first steps first, we've got hydrogen peroxide here,
And we need to add some soap to it, so one squirt.
For the small one, here we go, and then two squirts.
For the big one, here we go.
One, two.
Next up, we're going to add the color.
Dude, these are going to go everywhere, i can't.
Believe we're doing this in our kitchen.
This is not a good idea.
Dude i know.
This is going to create a huge eruption, so we've got.
Two different sized beakers, so we can see two different.
Sized eruptions, and maybe this one will actually be.
Bigger than this one.
Wait, what.
Be very careful, you got to mix them up like this.
Just, stir them around a little bit.
I'll stir that one real quick.
Thank you, devan.
We now have the catalyst, and it's the moment of truth,
The big moment devan, are you ready.
I'm ready.
Get positioned, we only have one shot at this.
Three, two, wait, if you want to win a 15 minute.
Video call with devan and i, text the word trick to 81800,
Right now, so pause the video text the word trick to.
81800, and you will automatically be entered in to win,
Right now, let's go.
Both in unison three, two, one.
Dude, it went everywhere.
Holy cow.
Dude, that was crazy.
That's insane.
Bro, that stuff was wild.
Alright guys, that works so good.
It's like cotton candy that's steaming.
It's like steaming, bro, this is real toothpaste.
Right now.
Oh my gosh.
Alright guys, you get to comment down below which.
Color was the coolest of this stuff, it is steaming.
It is so hot right now, we are on to the next one.
Bubble time.
Whoa, bro, your head.
In high pitched voice hello guys, right now we're.
Going to see how to make a giant dry ice bubble.
Dude, what.
Dude.
Alright, well i guess we're back to normal now-.
Bro that was crazy, and right now here's how you do it.
To kick this off, we have to make a crazy bubble solution,
 bubble boy.
Wait, what.
What are your powers, bro.
You haven't heard of my legendary powers,
Check these out.
Wow, you're making bubbles.
So amazing, wow.
I can tell you don't think i have real powers, i find that.
Kind of offensive, so you know what.
Bubble bath blast-off.
Bubble boy, i can see you.
I blasted off.
No, you didn't you're right here, bro.
Bubble bath blast-off #2.
Again, boom.
Oh, dude.
I heard that.
The fridge.
You came out of the fridge.
And i'm back to normal.
Alright, so first off we need to remove the top and.
Add some soap.
Alright, so i'm just going to add it in, so let's see here.
Look how good i am, bro, my aim is impeccable.
Then next up, add some water.
Turn it on.
More, devan.
No.
Now, bubble solution is ready,
And now it's time for the dry ice.
We actually have to put a hole in this container,
So here's how this works.
I'm going to use the finger of fury.
Bro, it's just you're face getting red.
Oh.
What.
Dude.
That's what you call the finger of fury.
I don't need a finger of fury, i have a sharpie,
And i can just cut it out.
Now that makes me angry.
Now, it's time to break up some dry ice, so here we go,
With three, two, one ooh.
You know what, i would say a chunk about this size.
Should do it.
Like this, here we go, pop that in there,
Okay now add some water to it here, that's it, done.
Okay, now i'm going to pop the top on here, it's working.
Now it's time for the bubbles, so as you can see,
Look at it, just like that.
This is so cool.
Yo, what.
Okay, now here we go, so now you're going to dip it into.
The top here, in the top of your soap thingy,
And you're going to pull it out and see if it works.
What.
It's getting bigger.
Three, two, one.
What.
It keeps going.
Oh, oh.
Don't move just let it-.
Both in unison oh.
Yes.

Both in unison oh.
Wait a second, devan, wait, wait.
Two bubbles merge.
Devan.
I want to see if i can make the biggest one possible.
Dude, it just bubbled up down there.
Alright, here we go.
Whoa, i got it, i got it, i got it.
What, no.
Both in unison dude.
I'm going to try to make a bubble like this,
Let's let it drop, let it drop, ooh.

It's like the perfect orb.
Alright, that is it, you get to comment down below who.
Made a cooler bubble, right now, we are on to the next one.
Both in unison oh.

It's time for a lightning storm with my hat.
Here we go, three, two, one.
Yo, dude that was awesome.
That was so bright.
Dude, where did you go.
I'm right here.
I can only see your hat and your clothes and stuff.
Oh my gosh.
Try holding this.
There you go.
Whoa.
It's like a floating pumpkin.
Yeet.
Oh, jeez.
Alright, i'm going to try to take off the hat.

The only way to get it off, devan, is what's called.
A head yeet.
A what.
It's called a.
Yes, i'm back to normal, bro, this is awesome.

Good, alright now, let's make some liquid lights.
To kick things off right now, oh my gosh, i guess we need.
Some highlighters around here, so fleet.
Or yeet.
Alright, we got some highlighter, so now it's time to remove.
Some things out of these highlighters.
Very specific.
Both in unison three, two, one.
Dude, it actually worked.
Oh no, pick it up, pick it up.
It was on the floor.
Three, two, one.
You got to uncork this.
Alright, highlighters inside now.
Now blow on it.
Alright.
Oh my gosh, bro, that's crazy.
Okay, done, alright perfect.
I'll pop this right in here.
Next step is, you take the cap, then you cut.
A hole in it, and then you take this thing,
And put it inside the cap.
So this first step, bro, you need to relax, so guys.
 water bottle, empty of water, we need.
A cap, and we need this little spout thing.
Put them all together you have a cap spout water thing.
Tada.
Next step we're going to it with rubbing alcohol,
And this is very important, oh man,
I'm not good at this stuff, and this is where.
It gets crazy because we're going to use these bottles.
To pump out the florisene out of these highlighters.
What.
It's running down my hand.
Oh, no, no, no.
It's spilling, it's spilling.
It's totally spilling.
We're having trouble with this.
It works.
This is crazy.
Alright, so we've got the florisene in here.
And the next step is to pop it in here, and we're going.
To heat it up for twenty minutes, and it's going.
To look crazy when it's done.
Alright, now it's time to mix them up.
Yo, so the twenty minutes are up and this stuff looks crazy,
It's time to test out the liquid light.
The florisene has been reduced to powder and now we're about.
To turn it into liquid light, but before we add it,
We need to consult the genie.
The what.
That's just a giant spoon, bro.
No, this is spoon-genie.
What.
You just combined two words dude.
This is spoon-genie, okay.
Now, i have to wake him up.
How. - like this.
Who dares wake spoon-genie from it's slumber.
We need your advice, how much powder should we add.
Google it.
So weird.
Let's just put him face down right now.
