You challenged us to try a whole bunch.
Of crazy school hacks.
One of them is a giant edible glue stick.
The winner gets $10,000.
So right now, let's go. - oh yeah.
You challenged us to do the ultimate egg drop test,
But we're using ostrich eggs.
These things are massive,
So right now let's figure out.
How we protect these eggs.
I'm using a giant squishie.
As the first layer of protection.
For my egg right here.
Devan i thought i'd use a watermelon.
As like an extra layer of protection.
Now it's time to take a look at the inside, here we go.
Both three, two, one.
It melts so perfectly. - that's so satisfying.
Collins dude, if you add too many rubber bands.
You'll make the watermelon blow up.
Devan nope, don't think so.
So here we go, gonna take the egg,
Gonna see if it fits.
Yes.
Like a glove.
Like a glove.
All right so here we go.
What just happened.
I told that was what's gonna happen.
Dude.
It's like dripping bro.
I warned you devan.
Now it's time to turn this thing over.
And i'm gonna be coating this in gallium,
Which is liquid metal, it's gonna add a metal coating to it.
Alright, time to put on the safety glasses.
Do not try this at home.
Three,
Both two, one.
Ohh.
Collins you can hear it sizzling.
Devan what.
Collins this looks nuts.
Devan that's insane.
Collins let's listen to it, man.
Devan it's like a chromed-out mario.
I think it's gonna add a really nice protective layer.
To my squishie.
Devan so for this next step i'm gonna be using oobleck.
Collin oh that's, hey, nah, nah, nah, not in my gallium.
I am so sorry.
Yo, dude.
Wait, what.
Collins this split my pan.
Whoa, put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down.
Collins} no, but dude look at that man.
That is absolutely insane, bro.
That is not good.
The heat must've like, cracked it open.
Devan oh, yeah.
I can feel it turning into oobleck already.
Got my metal squishie,
And now it's time to put an instant glue shell around it.
Devan all right, so i gotta add my chia seeds next,
So i'm gonna add these.
Devan, this about to smell real bad,
So we're gonna pop these masks on.
All right, here we go, stay still devan here we go.
Just gonna pop this on, just like this.
I'm sorry i'm trying to figure this out.
You're kind of yelling in my ear though.
All right, there we go, boom.
All right, yours is on.
Yep, that's really tight and secure.
Collins all right, here we go.
Three, two, one.
Both ooooh.
Devan look at that.
No way.
Collins what on earth.
Devan this is insane.
Collins this is nuts.
Devan this is crazy.
Collins that's awesome.
I'm making some indestructible slime,
We're starting off with.
The indestructible shaving cream mound.
What are you doing, making a shaving cream fortress.
Collins yes, exactly devan.
I'm making slime in a brand new way.
Devan i'm lining the inside of my melon with cement.
Next up we're gonna add some sta-flo,
And i really hope that the shaving cream's.
Gonna stop this stuff.
What exactly are you trying to do.
Collins i'm trying to make some slime, devan.
So here we go, just gonna mix it all in like this.
I really hope it starts coming together.
Uh oh, sta-flo.
No, oh, oh.
Sta-flo, stop.
Stop-flo.
Devan this is really messy.
Collins yo, look at this.
Whoa.
Devan dude, i gotta set it down.
Collins it got red so fast.
Dude, oh my gosh.
Devan all right the concrete watermelons are done,
Now it's time to make a nest.
And you're surprised by this.
Collins i'm just trying to do my best.
I've learned from my mistakes.
Oh my gosh and now i've got a bucket of slime.
Hold on, 'cause this next part takes.
A lot of concentration.
I need you to contain yourself.
All right, so you take the ice mold just like this,
And you wanna just go across very quickly like this.
Collins oh my gosh.
Next up we're gonna get some orbeez in here,
So let's see, we're just gonna pick up a whole bunch.
Of orbeez like this.
And then just, uh, sprinkle them in like that.
All right so i spun a couple more webs.
What.
What.
I'm sorry.
Devan and i made a pretty nice nest.
Collins yeah, that nest looks really good actually.
Devan yeah, it really does.
Collins now as you do that, it's time for me to.
Lift out my egg here and coat this thing in slime.
It's soggy.
So here we go we're gonna put it in like this.
And then we're just gonna kinda like cover it from the front.
So everyone say goodbye to my very well protected egg.
Let is just fall down and perfectly coat my egg,
Just like this.
What're you, what is that.
Devan i'm using flex tape.
It's time to seal it in a bag.
Why.
You'll see.
Here we go, we're gonna lift this up,
And on the count of three we're gonna drop it in.
You ready.
Three, two, one.
Devan.
I got you.
I can feel it cracking.
You're breaking the structure of it.
I got you, i got you.
No you are not.
You're overflowing.
That's because you didn't hold it right.
Why are you overflowing.
You did this to yourself.
What do you mean.
And to me.
Devan i need more flex tape bro.
I need more help.
Help me.
So here we go, just gonna put the pump on here.
Oh, dude, it's working.
Devan that looks terrible.
Yeah, that looks pretty funky, man.
I gotta say, i don't think it's your, uh,
Not your most pleasing work, i'll give you that.
Here we go, screw this on, and, all right.
I got a few finishing touches to add to mine,
And then it's time to find out if this can.
Really protect my egg and win the $10,000.
These things turned out crazy, man.
Like yours, very interesting.
Yeah, there's a lotta elements on it, mine though,
I think definitely has a big chance to win this,
So here's the big reveal.
Both three, two, one.
Tada.
Collins man.
What is that, bro.
Devan how the tables have turned.
Collins i know.
You get to comment down below,
Whose egg do you think will survive the drop.
We'll be testing it and finding out the winner.
Of the $10,000 at the end of the video.
You challenged us to do the ultimate art challenge,
But with a whole bunch of school hacks, so let's go.
For my art piece, i'm making an insane item from fortnite.
Devan and for mine i'm making an angry birds mosaic.
Collins i'm using acetone to melt.
A whole bunch of styrofoam in a very sticky paste.
Devan and i'm using liquid nitrogen.
To freeze some rubber duckies, and then explode them.
What on earth.
I'm almost scared right now.
Devan this hasn't happened before.
Collins let's do this, here we go,
We're gonna dump the whole bucket into mine.
We'll melt this down from the top as well.
Here we go.
Boom, like that, check it out.
Devan whoa.
All right now it's time to dump 'em all.
Collins do not try this at home.
Both three, two, one.
That is the worst rubber ducky bath i have ever seen.
Collins holy cow.
They're popping off.
What is going on.
Devan they're like fireworks on fourth of july.
I've never seen this before, man.
The goo is starting to come together,
So right now i'm gonna use a styrofoam cup to add even more.
I'm gonna use a styrofoam cup to add even more.
And check this out.
Look at that.
What.
You gonna see it like decomposing,
And deconstructing right in front of your eyes, man.
It can deconstruct in front of your eyes, man.
Now the moment of truth,
Time to see if the goo is actually working, so here we go.
Both yo.
Collins look at that.
Now it's time to smash these things up.
Dude if they were already like, popping off and bursting,
What's gonna happen when you smash it.
Yo, the goo is all done.
This stuff is wild.
All right just gonna scoop a couple out.
Just like this.
Both three, two, one.
Both oh.
Oh.
Collins i heard the squeak.
All right, yo, listen to them.
Collins all right, yo, listen to them.
Devan why are they squeaking.
That's what duckies do devan.
It's what they do.
I know but they're frozen.
All right, go for another one.
Here we go.
I'm sorry guys.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I have no idea what this has to do with art,
But i really hope it's gonna help you make a great piece.
Oh you'll see.
Next up i have a life hack with this iron and pastel.
While you do that i've got a roller blade here,
This is uh, not mine.
Uh oh, oh, oh, oh.
Okay, bigger chunks coming down.
All right, i've got the sketch out.
Outta my mosaic right here.
Yo, that looks awesome.
Devan just gonna place it down like this.
Both oh.
Devan yes.
Collins dude, that is awesome.
This would've taken so long without this.
Collins all right, well the rollerskate is done,
Again this is gonna act as the base of my fortnite item.
Devan next up i'm making squishy paint for my pigs.
Collins i am making a crazy unicorn horn.
Both ready, set, go.
Collins just gonna use some support here,
Gotta be very careful with it.
Devan i have no clue what's about to happen.
Whoa.
Collins it's working dude.
I gotta stay so still right now.
Devan it's like the instant water, dude.
Collins holy cow.
It's building up, bro.
Devan it's like you're making a candle from scratch.
Collins it's turning into a real unicorn horn, bro.
This literally looks like magic right now.
There you have it.
A literal unicorn horn made with actual magic.
Collins well as you do that,
I've got a whole bunch of styrofoam here,
And it's time for me to carve out the main piece of my art,
Devan, yeah.
Are you distracted at all.
Yeah, if you could stop doing that.
In the background that'll be nice.
Both three, two, one.
Whoa.
Collins oh, snap.
Boom, art, there we go.
Devan time for bowl number three.
Okay i got it, i got it, i got it.
Put bowl number one off to the side.
I mean, that pretty much worked.
Devan all right,
Now it's finally time to mix up the colors.
I wanna see if i can remove this piece right here.
Here we go, three, two, one.
Oh.
Whoa.
Dude, it's starting to come together, man.
Whoa.
You're super good with that tool.
Thank you man, yeah, i've found my true art passion.
All right i've got my place mat cleared,
Just gonna, kinda, just gonna pop that in right over here.
I am out of room.
I got some clay here to fill out the head.
Devan now i got a couple more colors to fill in.
Collins to extract the color from a crayon,
We're gonna do it in a very unique way.
We're gonna use a hair straightener right here,
Or curler, i dunno, this does something to your hair.
So here we go, we're just gonna melt a crayon.
On and drip it on to the little sponge.
Oh, man, look at that, it just melts down, so here we go.
Devan first step for me though, is laying down the glue.
Collins dude, it melts so quickly on this thing, man.
You can just line the whole thing like this.
I've got the melted crayons,
So right now time to do a little swipe on here.
You ready, here we go.
Both three, two, one.
Oh.
Wait, wait, where are you doing that.
I'm swiping it right here, man.
There we go, a rainbow, devan.
Isn't it clear, it's a rainbow.
Yeah.
This is my electric lawn applicator.
So i'm gonna pour some of this lawn into here.
There's an electrical current that runs through this.
You can think of this nail as a lightning pole,
What.
What.
I thought like, lightning was gonna strike us.
No no no.
It conducts the electricity through the glue here.
I just have to, kinda shake it around.
Collins so you're just like adding grass to it.
Now it's time to create the electrical reaction.
I don't know what to do with my hands, man,
I'm kinda scared.
Are you sure this isn't gonna create like,
Electricity everywhere or anything.
No, i'm not.
Both three, two, one.
Oh.
Devan man.
Collins whoa, look at that.
Devan it's like hopping around.
Collins dude, i know, the little piece are like.
Jumping all up in the air.
It's like an alien attack, man, it's like a.
Spaceship just dragging up a whole bunch of the grass.
Right now it's time for us to put.
The finishing touches on our art piece.
The art pieces are done,
And these things look absolutely crazy,
So here is the big reveal.
Absolutely crazy, so here is the big reveal.
Both three, two, one.
Tada.
Collins look at this thing, man.
And look at that.
Devan these are crazy.
Collins yeah, so you get to.
Comment down below whose art piece is better,
We'll be choosing the $10,000 winner.
At the end of the video.
You challenged us to make the ultimate school lunch hack,
With macaroni and cheese and pizza.
The winner gets $10,000 so let's go.
I'm kicking it off with the cheese for my pizza.
So here we're just gonna suck it up like this.
Devan and i'm making the cheese for my mac and cheese.
I'm turning it into a cheese powder.
Collins whoa, dude, look at it, it's like,
It's kinda like undulating on here, man.
Yo, this is insane.
Dude, you're not doing it right.
This, is how you do it.
You just go like this.
See, look at that.
You wanna powder rise in midair.
That's how you do it, devan.
Yo, wait a minute dude, look at this.
My cheese is coming together.
From the front it looks like delicious cheese,
But from the back, it looks like a frosty paradise.
For layer number two,
We're gonna be using this thing over here.
So let's just, ah, whoa.
So let's see, we're just gonna pour some of this in,
Three, two, one.
Ohh.
Devan it looks like a shower of cheese.
Oh, could you imagine.
A world with a shower of cheese.
Eh, eh, it's dripping, it's dripping, it's dripping.
No no no, no no no, no no no.
Suck it up.
Suck it up, and shoot it out.
Suck it up, and oh, my gosh.
Devan all right, goldfish are done,
Now i'm gonna add it to this bowl.
So i think it'd be super cool to spray my cheese.
Onto my noodles.
I'm gonna use some water to test it out.
Three, two, one.
Do it on my dry ice to see if it works.
That, it totally works.
Dev, that's water, that is water, that is water.
I feel like this is like my broom-broom machine.
You're gonna soak our whole room.
Devan it's like when you're in space.
And you need to get propelled and you're like.
A broom-broom machine.
I can see the astronauts be like.
This is uh, houston roger,
I can't find my broom-broom machine.
Oh houston, it's right here.
Gonna place this right over here,
Hopefully it does not melt.
And next up, we've got my quesadilla.
I mean, pizza crust.
Wait, that's a paper towel, collins.
I forgot what i'm doing.
Wait, you're actually filling it up with cheese.
Devan well yeah, it's gonna be the best way.
To add it to my macaroni.
Collins all right, here we go, just gonna use this.
Right here to suck up some pasta juice like this,
And then just kinda like sprinkle on the inside like that.
This is squeet pizza, here we go.
Okay then.
Didn't think that through.
I got my cheese prepared,
And now it's time to spray it on my noodles.
All right, here we go.
Three second like challenge.
Three second like challenge.
We wanna see if you can like this video in three seconds.
You ready.
Here we go.
Both three, two, one, done.
Three, two, one, oh.
Absolutely blasting it, dude.
I'm gonna use this to protect me, man.
Devan dude, it's actually working, though.
Collins it is.
Devan now i'm making my next cheese filling,
But i'm gonna do it in a really rapid fashion.
I'm using sodium citrate to speed up the process.
All right, i'm making my own relish.
With some pickles here.
Dude, if you put your hand in here you get a pickle hand.
Pickle hands, devan, legitimate pickle hands.
Awww.
Ah, it's falling apart.
You really do love pickles, don't you.
I love pickles.
Devan all right, you know this is done when.
It turns into a slime consistency.
Collins it looks like an alien carcass right here man,
Area 51 watch out,
This is what you're gonna find in it, man.
Dude, the cheese filling is done,
Now it's time to make the ravioli.
All right, take this dough,
Put it over the top of the ice cube maker.
Collins all right here we go,
Just gonna add a little bit of onions right here.
And last up we got some cornstarch.
Three, two, one, here we go.
Okay, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And there we go, okay yep.
And, done.
Okay, there we go, my relish is all finished up, and now,
It's time to add it to my pizza.
That's right, i'm gonna have a relish stuffed pizza crust.
Devan i've got the covering to my ravioli right here.
Just gonna lay it on top.
Collins all right, here we go,
Gonna take some relish here like this.
Aw, man, dude, look at this.
You know when the lunch lady asks what you want,
Always say you want relish stuffed pizza crust.
And she'll be very confused.
Next up we gotta skin these potatoes,
So i got the drill right here,
But i realized, i've been going on mode one.
There's actually a second more powerful mode.
Oh no.
You were not supposed to find that.
Mode two.
Three, two, one.
Why did you dump it in first.
Oh, jeez.
What is the point of this.
To be honest, i um.
I thought a lot more would've happened.
Doesn't appear to have um, had any impact whatsoever.
Are you just trying to get everything messy dude.
On my potatoes.
Let's go for a little gentler approach.
Devan dude, maybe turn it on one.
It's on two.
It's gonna work, devan.
Progress, there we go, you can see it's a little peeled.
I don't know if it was totally worth it.
Devan look at this.
Collins dude.
Devan look at this.
All right, done, the potatoes are actually peeled, dude,
Look at this, man.
Devan for my next life hack i'm turning pizza sauce.
Into an edible glue stick.
Collins time for me to shred up.
Some of my potatoes here,
And this is gonna be a huge part of mine.
Devan for the rest of this life hack,
I just gotta pour this stuff into the straws.
All right my straws are filled,
Now it's time to pop 'em in the fridge.
All right, i just gotta keep shredding my potatoes.
Devan all right the glue sticks are back,
Now it's time to take 'em out of the straws.
Both oh.
That looks insane.
It's like a little worm.
All right, got the glue sticks out,
Now it's time to pop 'em in the freezer.
All right so while that's in the freezer,
I'm gonna roll out some dough.
Collins next up we're making a.
Tater tot grilled cheese sandwich.
It's a crazy life hack,
But first we gotta slice up some cheese right here.
So here we go, just gonna use this butter knife right here.
I've got something that's gonna be even cooler.
So i got the glue sticks out of the freezer.
And now, i'm gonna put them onto my pizza.
Collins that's not a glue stick though,
That's pizza sauce, right.
Devan yes.
Collins yo, this reminds me of like.
Melted cheese and create a grilled cheese.
Without having to cook it at all, man.
Devan yeah, i wasn't really sure.
This was gonna work, and it did.
All right i'm gonna make a panini here.
With my tater tots and cheese.
So here we go, just gonna place some uh, some layers.
Oh my gosh.
Devan all right, last thing on my pizza.
Is some pepper slices.
Collins all right, well as you're doing that,
I gotta get my next layer of tots right here.
So here we go,
Just gonna layer these things like this on top't.
Devan all right this pizza's ready to pop in the oven,
And now i'm gonna make a pasta bowl, out of pasta.
All right the first step is to grab this balloon here.
Collins all right well as you do that,
It's time for me to smash this thing down.
And turn it into an actual panini made out of tots.
Three, two, one.
Devan you don't think that's too much.
Collins no.
Here we go, just gonna smash it down like this.
We dislodged a couple pieces of cheese.
Oh.
Dude.
Well.
Do not try this at home.
Do not try this at home.
All right, let's give this another shot.
Three, two, one, just gonna squish it down.
Both oh.
Collins man.
Devan this is some edible glue here.
I'm gonna put on the outside of my balloon,
To make these noodles stick.
Let's see how this turned out, here we go.
Three, two, one.
It's an actual waffle.
Three, two, one.
Look at that, it's my pasta bowl made of pasta.
All right, well we've got all the ingredients.
And now it's time to make our final school hack lunches.
The school hack lunches are all done,
And my mouth is watering right now.
Both these look amazing.
So here is the big reveal.
Both three, two, oh.
Five second subscribe challenge.
We wanna see if you can subscribe to this channel.
And turn on the channel post notifications in five seconds.
You ready.
Here we go.
Both five, four, three, two, one, done.
If you can do that,
Comment down below keyper squad right now.
Both three, two, one, tada.
Collins these both look amazing.
You get to comment down below.
Whose school lunch hack is going to taste better.
We'll be finding out the $10,000 winner.
At the end of the video.
We've got all the school hacks,
And now it's time to test them.
To find out who's gonna win the $10,000.
It is time for the egg drop test, and i gotta say man,
Looking at both of these, i do not know.
Which one's gonna successfully be able to do it man.
I know, this did not quite fulfill my vision for it.
Collins but right now it's time for us to hop outside.
And see which one is able.
To better protect its egg from cracking.
We've got our eggs,
And now it's time to drop them to see.
If they'll actually be able to withstand the impact.
I think, did a pretty good job on the construction here,
What about you.
I don't know about mine, mine's falling apart already.
This is a pretty high drop, man,
We're gonna be trying to hit the bullseye.
For the baseline test,
We're gonna drop a real unprotected ostrich egg.
To see if that cracks on the ground.
And here is the unprotected ostrich egg.
Three.
Both two, one.
Both oh.
Devan did that crack the cement.
Collins i don't know, man, that was quick.
How bout this, collins.
I'm gonna hop down there, you chuck it down,
And we'll assess the damage.
The way that that egg broke,
I don't know if this'll be able.
To fully withstand the impact.
I don't know, dude,
I think you have a huge chance of success.
The thing about mine is,
I've got a giant squishie,
That was the first thing i cut open,
Then i covered it in a whole bunch of gallium,
We've got slime in here, and the baking soda and water.
That reaction that happened coated it.
In an unbreakable substance, man.
In a scale of one to ten, devan,
Where do you think this one falls, in terms of uh,
Ten being it has full chance of making it, one, it's done.
I think you've got like a solid eight and a half.
An eight and a half.
I don't know.
Should i just kinda like, hold it out,
And then just drop it.
No, you've gotta give it a nice throw, or maybe a lob up.
Three.
Both two, one.
Both oh.
Collins oh, no.
Devan orbeez everywhere.
Collins oh no.
I don't know if that was so good for you, man.
Collins i think the bottom of the bag,
I think burst open.
Devan oh my goodness.
We're gonna take the bag apart afterwards to see,
If it stayed intact.
Devan, you wanna, you wanna trade,
So you wanna come up here.
Yeah, i'll go up there.
Collins all right so we do a little switch right now.
This is gonna be super interesting,
Because i coated my egg in a watermelon.
I popped with rubber bands.
Cement on the inside.
Oh yeah, not to mention oobleck.
On the outside for safe measure.
I can hear the egg moving around in mine.
That's not good.
That is not a good sign.
Collins the nest on the inside.
That's what really blows my mind, because like,
I think that that might be your saving, what.
I almost just dropped it.
Here we go.
Both three, two.
Wait up, wait.
If you wanna win a fifteen minute video call.
With devan and i, text the word school to 81800 right now.
So pause the video, text the word school to 81800,
You'll automatically be entered in to win,
And let's see how this goes.
Both three, two, one.
Collins no way.
Devan no way.
Collins that was a solid thud,
Like it did not crack at all.
Dude, i think i just won.
Ah, yeah, let's grab these eggs, let's hop back inside.
Now it's time for the moment we've all been waiting for,
Time to find out which egg was able to withstand the drop.
So how 'bout this,
We'll start with yours first.
Devan yeah, i think this flex seal tape.
Is gonna be a lot to get through, so i brought a saw.
To get into mine.
Yeah, do not try this at home.
Oh.
There's a crack, wait wait wait wait wait.
Devan i can see it, all right.
Here we go, the big reveal, let's see if it worked, ready.
Both three, two, one.
No.
I thought this would work.
It's not even like cracked, it's obliterated.
If that's what happened to yours, what happened to mine.
All right, well, let's take the bag open here,
We've got all the squishies, we got the toast.
Don't forget about the toast.
So the first bag got breached,
But did the second bag pop open.
Here we go, let's, oh, yes, it did.
Look at that.
Orbeez everywhere.
Look at that.
Devan oh, jeez.
Collins here's the egg.
Devan the slime is like fully coating it, man.
Collins all right here we go,
We got the egg here, so let's see if we can just.
Pull off some chunks of slime, like this.
The real question though, man, is did it survive.
I am so concerned right now.
Come on.
All right, well, uh, fun fact,
It's very difficult to find out where,
How i closed this thing.
Oh dear.
Yo, here we go, let's see if we can just tear it open.
Both ohh.
What.
What, what, what, what, what.
I just saw something.
You ready for the big reveal.
I'm ready.
All right, here we go.
Both three, two, one.
Collins let's give it a tear.
Devan what, what, i can't see it yet.
Look at it, it's perfect. - no.
Not even a scratch.
No way.
One hundred percent intact.
You get to comment down below,
What is one ingredient you would use.
To save devan's egg from not cracking.
Got the ultimate school hack lunches,
And now it's time to find out which one tastes better.
My delicious infused crust pizza, or your whack bowl.
Devan yeah, i think we should try.
Your bland dish over here.
Whoa.
Let's start off with my grilled cheese tater tots,
I gotta say, oh boy, it's a little um, crumbly.
You want the bigger one or the smaller one.
I'll take the smaller one.
It smells really good.
Whoa.
I'm actually really excited for this.
Yeah, i'm pretty thrilled for this.
I hope this works.
Let's uh, let's touch tots.
Both three, two, one.
Whoa.
Whoa.
I wouldn't say it's quite a whoa, or a whoa,
But you know, i think it's pretty solid.
What.
Yours has a pretty high bar to climb.
If it really wants to reach it man.
Did you put peppers on there.
Yes.
Were you watching what i was doing.
Not really.
Devan i will offer you the choice,
Which slice do you want.
These are your only two choices.
Both three, two, one.
Mmm.
Whoa.
Is there anymore of that.
I wish i did, but no, i already ate it.
Collins wow.
I didn't think it was possible,
But that was better than the tater tots man.
Way better.
Like, million times better.
Collins it comes down to the main dish, devan.
I'll take this slice over here.
Oh, there we go.
Look at that, you see the relish in there.
I'm folding it over like this,
And i'm gonna take a bite over here,
So i get the sauce, the cheese, the relish and the crust,
All in one, bam.
Both three, two, one.
Whoa. - wow.
I wasn't totally sure on this combo.
That is interesting.
Yours, i don't think is gonna be able to top that.
Devan three, two, one.
Collins why is it a brick.
These should be individual pieces.
It formed to the bowl.
Here you go.
Wait, so i get a whole, i get a whole slice of this.
Right, here we go.
Both three, two.

Collins you get to comment down below,
Whose school lunch do you think tasted better,
And we'll be finding out the $10,000 winner.
At the end of the video.
We got the edible glue stick,
We've tested all the school hacks,
And now it's time to find out.
Who is truly worthy of the $10,000.
So for the egg drop,
I think i was definitely the clear winner.
I mean, my egg actually stayed intact.
Whereas yours, just shattered everywhere.
So there we go, one point to me.
Now for the art project,
I gotta give that one to you devan,
I think you had some cool stuff.
You made electric grass, you smashed up little duckies.
It was pretty wild, so there we go, point for you.
But now what it comes down to is the school hack lunches,
And this one, is a bit of a toss up, man.
There's a lot of crazy things that we did in this,
And i gotta say although you won the appetizers,
I won the main dish, but that being said.
Devan uh huh.
My appetizer was pretty good.
Collins and i think if we compare your appetizer.
To my main dish, devan wins the video.
Devan yes.
Collins so that means you win the $10,000.
And the giant edible glue stick.
But now it's time to find out.
What this edible glue stick actually tastes like.
Devan i know right.
Can i feel how heavy this thing is.
It is really, really, heavy.
Oh my gosh.
You gotta hold onto it.
You got it, you got it, you got it.
I'm super strong.
Holy cow, that's heavy.
Stand up, stand up, i got you.
You should just take it back.
I will take it, i will take it.
I don't even know how i'm gonna eat this.
I think i gotta hold it for you.
Oh, okay yeah, sure.
You got it.
I got it.
You 100% got it.
I 100% got it, devan.
Three, two, one.
Ah.
Ow.
I can't see, is it working.
No.
It's way harder than i expected.
It's gotten on your teeth.
Wait, smile devan, smile forward.
Does it taste good.
It's definitely edible, and it tastes delicious.
Well this is getting super heavy,
So if you wanna see another video.
You gotta click right over here.
You got give seconds, here we go.
Both five, four, three, two, one, done.
We love you, no.
Bye.
Bye.
Have you not seen this, it's literally rolling.
I see it, but you've ruined a rollerskate.
I did not ruin this, devan,
It is made better by what i've done.
You're getting feathers everywhere.
It's shedding season for my rainbow smash over here.
