Well, what's up guys.
It's collins key,
And welcome to the thursday vlog.
It's gonna be a very different video today,
As you can tell,
And to start things off,
I need someone very special to help me out.
So, everyone, please welcome to the, uh, adjacent chair,
Devan keys.
Ay.
What's up.
So, yeah. welcome to the video, and today--.
I thought he was going for a little handshake, but nope.
A hand--.
Nope.
Left him hangin'.
There we go, and then hit him with a.
For today's video,
It's going to be, like i said, a little bit different.
I was actually inspired.
By some other youtubers to go to the 99-cent store,
Which i've never done before,
Get a whole bunch of random products there.
And now, basically,
I'm just going to test them out.
And see whether or not they work.
Or do what they're supposed to do.
Because they're from the 99-cent store,
So i don't know if that changes the quality of 'em at all.
And also,
Make sure you guys watch til the very end.
Because at the very end,
I'm going to post some bloopers and outtakes.
From this video.
So, make sure you guys give this video.
A big thumbs up.
If you're excited to see.
What random things we've gotten.
And, yeah.
Let's jump into the video.
So, we're going to be starting off with a bang,
And we're going to be--.
The party poppers with confetti.
I didn't know you'd be going that fast.
Let's see if this is a--.
Oh.
Well, it opens very easily.
I gotta say that.
There's this gun round cartridge,
And then the party popper.
Dude, wait, wait, wait.
I don't even know what we're doing.
Hey, whoa, whoa.
We have to be like, coordinated.
Do you know what you're doing.
I'm moving faster than you.
Dude, you don't even know what you're doing.
Oww.
That actually hurt, dude. oww.
There's no face shots.
But a nut shot.
Oww.
You are a savage.
No face.
You shot at my face.
Oh well. my bad.
Dangerous.
Do it again. do it again.
Alright,
Well the verdict on.
This first party popper gun with confetti.
They're awesome.
This was amazing.
If you go to shoot each other in the face.
Now, the next item is a golf club,
And these are very plastic.
They look pretty cheap and they feel pretty cheap.
Like, you can just like--.
And just like break it.
But we're gonna go outside and test them out for sure.
You're not gonna win.
Yeah, let's go do it.
Teeing up for the shot.
He's placing his golf ball.
On the proper position for him to be able to.
Hit the golf ball at a relatively high speed.
There is a, umm, 400 mile an hour wind.
Coming at us in this direction.
Gotta shake my booty.
No.
You missed so bad.
Oh, gosh.
I gotta get myself out of the way.
Yeah.
You totally--you suck.
Hole in one.
I win.
These are a fail.
Yeah, i gotta say these are kind of a fail.
Umm, and look at these.
They like, they break so--.
It's like a nun chuck that's like--.
So, yeah.
These are are definitely a fail, guys.
Next, we have very masculine glow sticks.
What are you doing.
So, umm, yeah.
Let's see if these work, or if these completely fail.
Oh, it smells so bad.
Yup.
This is definitely not chemical or toxic.
And now, to finish it all off.
Ta-da.
Sword fight.
Whoa, dude. chill. i am zee winner.
I gotta say i'm a little bit disappointed.
That this part here doesn't actually glow.
I thought this was gonna be like.
A glowy thing in and of itself.
Overall, the verdict is a fail.
This is actually a really pointy tip. i probably--.
Stop.
So, this next one.
Is one of the only items devan picked out,
And you'll know why for a reason.
I don't-- what is--.
Would you explain to them why you got that.
He told me to pick a brand.
Like, what is this.
Apparently, it's to hold clothes.
I guess, let's go for it.
So, we were going to try this product out inside on drywall.
Which is what it is intended for,
But we wanted to go above and beyond for this video,
So we've got this, umm, this wood over here.
It's a nice, solid wood.
We're gonna try it out.
These are like razors almost.
So, let's see.
I'm gonna just try to put this in the wall real quick.
It doesn't penetrate the wood.
As easily as i thought it would, but, umm, there we go.
It's kinda-- it's kinda in there.
Actually, we don't have a hammer with us right now,
So devan--.
Found a rock in the house.
Take it away.
So, now we have this thing,
Which i think we just stick that there.
Oh, perfect.
Perfect.
Exactly how it was intended to be used.
Let's give it a shot.
Hey.
It works.
It actually worked.
Holy cow.
Alright, cool.
So, yea.
I give this a, umm, a 10 out of 5.
This is a 10 out of 5 right here.
'cause look at this.
You can-- oh.
Next item is called the power ball gun.
Ooh.
And it comes with targets and everything,
But we all know what i'm gonna use as target practice.
Not my face.
I think how it works is you pull it back like this--.
Lame.
That was lame.
This is--.
Okay, so this product is right off the bat,
This is-- 'cause if you don't put your hand here,
It just falls right out,
So this product is a massive fail.
And next up,
We have hand drums.
Yay.
Man, i'm gettin' purple.
First of all,
I gotta say that this is not really a hand drum,
'cause there is--look at this compared to my hand.
Like, this fits in my hand.
Mad beats.
Mad flow.
You look so funny with--.
They're not a win,
But they're not a fail.
And the only other product that devan bought is--.
No. no.
Yes.
This is actually something that he bought,
And just really wanted to try it out.
No way, dude.
Regardless of whose idea it was,
Which it was his, let's get into it.
It was actually his.
Let's do it.
Whatever.
It's basically like a picture.
With just a whole bunch of numbers on it,
And there's like different--i feel like a magician.
So, we were gonna do this.
Until we found out that sparkles are involved.
Get that outta here.
We are not a fan of sparkles.
This was a massive fail.
We are not a fan of this.
Because it included sparkles.
Big, big fail.
So, onto the next one.
I forgot, devan did get one more thing.
He comes up to me, he's like,
"i don't know what this is.".
It's a toilet freshener.
He literally brought me a toilet freshener.
And it smells.
Like one of those disgusting porta-potties.
Look--smell it.
No.
It's totally disgusting. yes.
That's so gross.
You were the one who bought it.
Okay. smell it.
Smell it.
This is a massive fail.
I don't know why you would want your toilet.
To smell like another toilet.
So, this is a massive fail.
Now, for this next one, we're gonna be makin' some noise.
We're testing out, umm, the trumpet.
And a whole bunch of flutes.
You sounded like a dying duck just now.
Go for it.
I can't, man. i'm laughing too hard.
There you go.
Ay.
What were you doing. you were like.
I was not.
It's like really late right now,
And people are trying to sleep.
And these are definitely a win.
That's not as bad as the whistle.
Yeah, so--.
He's just not good at blowin' things.
So, for me, the verdict is, these are a huge win.
These are a massive win.
No.
Fail.
So, next up are something called "wall walkers,".
Which are basically little blue men that are--.
Look how disturbing these things are.
Look at this.
Like, you could literally pull them apart, and-- oww.
Ay.
Whoa.
Hey.
They're all-- see, yeah.
They are walking.
That's really cool.
Okay.
Look at this one right over here.
Whoa.
Oh.
Ah, man.
He died.
Oh, no, he's alive.
Okay, these are actually a massive win.
No look.
Yeah, that was nice.
Did it work.
Yup.
Whoo.
Now, this final item is the most expensive item.
It is actually a dollar, 29.
They are rockets, so let's open 'em up.
I think these are gonna be, like,
Too explosive to do inside,
So we are gonna go outside and try 'em out right now.
But, umm--.
I like the sound of it so far.
So, yeah. let's go try em out.
Oh, man.
This is the rocket test. ready, aim, fire.
Ah. dude.
Oh. are you good to go.
And now,
To settle this once and for all, the quick draw.
Two steps, ready, and begin.
The final verdict.
On the most expensive item in this video.
Is that they were a win.
We had fun with these.
Don't point that at my face.
Please stop.
Ah.
That's right.
No.
Not again.
What are you doing, you crazy man.
Ah, no, what are you doing.
Okay, yes.
