Both oh.
My gosh.
You challenged us to test.
A whole bunch of instagram famous slimes.
And we're kicking it off with the most requested one.
Both butter slime.
Oh no, no.
No, no no you don't.
I was so close.
You will not be doing that.
Ew okay, okay stop it, stop it.
Okay lesson learned.
If you're inside, this is not a messy challenge.
Truce.
And truce.
Take my hand.
Truce.
Truce. - all right.
Now that we're all cleaned off,
Devan you have officially lost your shaving cream privileges.
And step number one for the butter slime needs,
Where'd you get that.
Okay so step number one you got to add the glue to,
Are you kidding me.
You never know when,
Might, might go.
You never know.
So guys step number one you're going to add the glue.
Some glooby glue.
Gloop gloop gloop gloob.
Whoop whoop whoop try saying.
That 10 times fast.
Glooby glue, glooby glue, glooby glue,
Gloob gloob gloob gloob.
All right next up, baking soda.
No shaving cream.
Oh. - tips of these.
All right.
Announcer two hours later.
How's that working out for ya.
Not too good.
Boom.
Add it in, sha boinks, okay.
Next up.
Oh my gosh.
Baking soda, he got baking soda.
No, that joke's from like 2015.
Yeah but you got it on your shirt.
So it's, that's still funny.
All right so let's see we're just going to grab.
A little teaspoon out.
Ha.
My mouth is like foaming bro.
Baking soda, i taste baking soda.
We have to do one more. - taking it back in.
That's not sanitary. - no it's not.
Okay next up, two tablespoons of contact solution.
Next up we have to mix it til it's marshmallowy.
Getting nice and marshamllowy, whoa ha ha.
Nice dude.
The thing about these slimes,
Like i've seen these things blowing up.
All over instagram and i really want.
To test to see whether they're actually legit.
Yo this is some crazy feeling slime.
It feels like a sh'more.
Really.
Like a marshmallow. - like a sh'more.
A sh'more, we're creating our own vocabulary.
We're like shakespeare.
Slight deviation from the normal vocabulary.
Blonde it feels super bizarre.
Devan oh it does, it feels like a marshmallow actually.
It's not slimy but like it looks.
Like you would want to bite into it.
Okay so next step devan is to add the clay.
And that's how we turn this.
From mush mallows into booter slyme.
Now put it in the center.
Okay.
Blonde okay and then yes nice, smoosh it it.
Oh.
I can hear it popping inside, that's crazy.
Oh this feels so good.
Let's do this, let's split it in half.
That way we can go double time on it.
I'll take half, whoa.
We've got two different strats right now.
I'm going to go for adding a bigger mound of clay,
He's going for smaller amount.
And i'm going for a more modest amount.
Let's go.
There you go he's going to push it in.
Oh that look he worked out so well.
When you kind of spread to begin with.
'cause it doesn't get all clumpy then in the middle.
It just like really mixes right into it.
That's a good idea.
Oh.
So my butter slime is all ready.
And devan's didn't.
Quite turn out. - no it's not so great.
It just crumbles apart.
Oh my gosh this looks so cool.
Oh you nailed it.
It looks so good.
It looks crazy.
So now we're going to add the yellow dye to it.
And that way it's going to now look like butter.
And then we're going to try to do.
The ultimate butter slime test.
Which is like.
Spread it with a knife.
There we go, for for it.
All right that's enough, that's enough that's enough.
Your whole hands are all yellow.
Oh my gosh. - i fail all across the board.
This slime is crazy how much is actually resembles butter.
Devan whoa.
You can see it's starting.
To like come through a little bit.
Mine looks like cheese.
Blonde yo.
Devan oh that looks.
This looks seriously like butter.
It looks just like butter.
Oh my gosh.
This is insane.
Both whoa oh.
Oh.
Darn it.
All i want is for my slime to be just.
Like yours collin.
Devan crushes me at like the pancake challenge.
Which is all art,
But then when it actually comes to the hands on.
Craft stuff this is the first time.
I've ever like done it better than he has.
I'm shocked.
Flabbergasted.
Are you going to try and flip it around.
What, why would you do that my butter slime.
Now for the ultimate test.
Will it butter.
I think it'll spread.
Hold on i just i want to cut it first.
Collin oh that went well.
And then i'm just going to put this on there.
And then see if it will spread, no.
Unh unh.
Nope, that did not really work at all.
I dare you to take a bite.
Out of the toast with it.
With the butter on it.
You do. - yeah.
Well after you smacking me in the face.
With shaving cream, i don't think so.
Hold up where mine really excels.
Is bounciness.
See look at it.
Mine does the same thing dude.
Yeah mine does the same thing.
No it's just not like mine.
Oops i lost my butter.
See mine just has this extra spring.
To it that-- - ow.
Just a nice little thing of butter here.
Let me see if i can just.
Spread it.
Collin yeah we'll go from like right around here.
Devan oh.
Collin the satisfaction.
That's nice.
Where did mine go so wrong.
This is like so satisfying.
Like i literally i did not think that slime.
Would actually be able to spread like butter.
But oh my gosh this just looks so cool.
It looks just like butter.
Like this is crazy.
Okay okay okay okay.
We just made the most satisfying butter slime.
Of all time, what are you doing.
The next one we are doing is called crunchy slime.
And it's kind of on the opposite end.
Of the spectrum but still just as satisfying.
Glue me devan.
I got,
Chu bro.
Yo this is so cool, there's so many crunchy balls.
And this was actually suggested.

But all of you commented and let us know.

Can make glue look like the most delicious food.
In the entire world.
I low key want to eat glue right now.

If you ever wondered how to make slime,
We don't know.
So we eyeball it.
Oh my gosh. - oh, no.
This does not look good.
It went from looking so delicious.
To like expired.
Devan hit me with some more sta-flo.
Devan there you go.
That's perfect.
Devan yeah it's getting pretty solid.
Oh. - it looks so cool.
Making slime is so much fun.
Like it's truly a passion of mine.
That was the best attempt we've had yet.
It was like bubblegum.
So i think next it's time.
To add the crunchy elements to it.
All right.
Air drop. - oh.
Just sticks to it.
Give him some more.
Oh, wow.
Oh. - hey.
They just stick.
Ah that's so funny.
This is so much fun.
I'm just going to chuck all of these.
No, no no no. - all right you ready.
Oh the mess is so worth it.
Collin i think we're just going to close him up.
Devan trying to make his head.
Here we go.
Oh, this is so cool.
Bloop, bloop bloop, blue la loop.
I got to admit like this is cool,
But it's not like crunchy.
I feel like we should add this one.
All right here we go.
Oh, ah ho ho.
Oh that looks so cool.
All right don't drop any collins.
It's you know i'm over here being really clean.
And neat and tidy.
Oh i can tell.
This reminds me of the candy slime we made,
It's just you can't eat this one,
But like just with all the little things in there.
Looks like you could eat it.
Devan oh that sounds so cool.
Both oh my gosh.

Pow. - whoa.
Devan, have you ever felt like.
A fish bowl in a bowl of fish.
No.
Well we're about to make some slime.
That resembles it.
All right.
This one sounds really confusing.
But it's called fish bowl slime.
Like which part of the fish bowl.
Are we making.
I have no idea.
We're using clear glue for this one.
And then we're also going to use some glitter.
Can you grab the baking soda devan.
Did you just say glitter.
I did.
We're using glitter.
Yeah.
Can we skip that step.
I didn't want to tell you about it.
But that's what we're doing.
Devan and i are terrified of glitter.
If you guys didn't know.
Two pinches now.
Two, no.
Devan's like that was a pinch.
Nicely done.
What a perfect pinch.
Baking soda bae.
Yeah.
This ain't just regular glitter bro,
This glitter's extra fine.
Just do a teeny little bit, please.
That's perfect.
That's it, that's it.
No that's it.
Collin we got to just add both of it.
No, really,
That's way too much.
Way too much okay.
You're mixing this one.
Now one more step before we actually turn.
This into slime is these things called filler beads.
I don't think that's how you're supposed.
To open it bro.
Both oh.
They're even like stuck to my shirt.
How does that happen.
Devan that's it, that's it that's it.
We're going to add a little bit.
Of contact solution at a time.
Time to mix it up and to see how this goes.
Devan oh you're making little bubbles.
But it looks so cool.
Yo. - whoa.
That looks like so cool. - crazy.
I'm not a fan of glitter,
But i got to admit glitter is,
It's kind of essential for this one.
This is actually, yeah this is actually really good.
Oh my gosh and the glitter's not coming off.
It's a holy miracle.
The texture of this is so crazy.
Like you can just, you can see all.
The little sparkles in it and everything.
