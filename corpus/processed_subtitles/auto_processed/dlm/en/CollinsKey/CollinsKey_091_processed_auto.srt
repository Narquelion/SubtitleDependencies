Oh my god.
Santa almost died.
That was close.
What's up guys. it's collins key.
And welcome to my new holiday video.
One of my favorite things about the holidays.
Is being able to spend so much time with my family.
So for today's video appearing right here.
In front of our awesome christmas tree.
Please welcome devin key.
Hey, whoa, whoa. ow.
Okay, you're done. get out of my video.
Yeah, that was fun, okay.
Okay, i'm taking this away from you.
Since this is the holidays,
I made my very own holiday challenge,
It's called the human.
Gift wrapping.
Challenge.
It's really fun,
But basically we're each gonna have a minute and half.
To wrap each other like a gift.
This is so hard to do an intro on this.
Turn it up,
Oh,
Yeey.
Let's get started with the challenge.
For the challenge,
Since devin is the guest on my channel key,
He'll have the honor and he can go first.
Three, two, go.
No, no, no.
What.
I know what you're gonna.
Ah man.
Oh no.
I think it's been a minute.
Since he's wrapped up and completely.
Yeah, this is great, this is great.
Great fun, great fun, great fun.
Completely defenseless,
One bow there, one there, one there, and one there.
Help, santa, immediately.
The bonus challenge within the challenge,
How fast can i escape from the wrapping.
Yeah.
While devin is hitting him.
Oh, dude, why.
Ow. this is actually not fun.
Ow.
Okay.
Yay.
That was round one.
Of the human wrapping challenge.
Now it's my turn to make him look like a human present.
Three, two, one, go.
Can i resist at all.
No, dude, you're supposed to help me.
Notice the nice corset right here.
To really accentuate his tuckus.
His tuckus is nicely accentuated.
Woo. yeah.
No.
Yo.
