What's up guys, it's collins key,
And happy thanksgiving hangover.
Now i hope you guys had a fantastic thanksgiving holiday.
And my favorite things about thanksgiving is of course,
Spending time with your family,
And also being able to eat as much food as you want.
For one day and no one judges you,
It's absolutely amazing.
So for today's video, thanksgiving kind of inspired me.
And i wanna actually do a food eating contest.
I want to make this extreme, so to make it extreme,
I'm gonna bring along a little someone with me.
The destroyer of worlds.
Devan key.
Both hey.
What up.
How's it going.
That's probably the best intro.
I've ever had. - destroyer of worlds.
Destroyer of worlds.
Turn up. - yes.
Come on, let's scoot over here.
We'll look better. - okay.
Alright cool, hey. - hey what up.
Now look normal.
For this pie eating contest, i brought along.
In your face.
A pie.
A pie.
And i have to eat this pie in one minute.
And the reason devan is here, is because devan.
Is going to be the pie defender.
His only job.
Is to make sure that i do not eat this pie.
In that amount of time.
And the winner gets to slap the other person.
With some whipped cream in the face.
Let's do it.
Give him some whipped cream.
Oh no.
It's like, oh shoot.
Dude it's like diarrhea.
Yo this is really necessary.
Yo.
Look at this.
There's no way i can eat this in a minute.
There's no way.
I'm so gonna win.
Pie eating contest starts in three, two, one, go.
Devan okay.
You hit my eye.
Oh.

You laughed, you laughed.

Can't leave you alone.
Okay, here let's see if we can get.
That doesn't work.
Okay.

I think it's been a minute.
Alright, let's do it.
It's been a minute.
It's in my nose.
It's in my nose.
No, it's done.
It's a minute.
That was disgusting.
Alright so devan won this challenge.
And now he gets to do a smack hand with some whipped cream.
I'm not excited about this.
I don't know how i was ever supposed to win this challenge.
In the first place, this was impossible.
First of all.
That nerf bullet.
It literally hit me right in the eye.
Like right in the eye.
And then you hit me with a sock right in the eye.
Right after that.
I couldn't see out of this eye for like a couple seconds.
Yo it's in my sock.
It's like in my sock.
This is worse than wet socks.
Look at, scroll down to all the mess.
Look at this.
