Go.
I just ate a cricket.
Aah, i ate that.
What's up. it's collins key,
And welcome to the thursday vlog.
Now, for today's video,
If you guys can't tell by the empty chair right here.
I need someone to help me out,
So everyone please welcome my friend, mel joy.
Hey. whoa. - hey.
Now for today's video,
We are going to be taste-testing foreign candy.
But we wanted to turn this into more of a challenge.
So basically, we had a third party go out there.
And buy a whole bunch of candy.
My dad, he did that.
Shout out to my dad, love you.
So yeah, he went out and he bought a whole bunch.
Of different candy and we're gonna close our eyes,
He's gonna give us the candy,
We're gonna taste, try to figure out what it is.
Whoever guesses what it is first,
That person wins that round.
And the loser of that round gets one tooth knocked out.
Let me explain this.
You guys know when you were kids and your parents would.
Always tell you that if you eat too much candy,
Your teeth will fall out.
Well that's what's gonna be happening today.
So we got this stuff from the costume store.
And so it makes it look like.
You have no teeth in your mouth.
For every candy you get wrong,
You have to black out one tooth.
And so whoever loses the most amount.
And gets all their teeth blacked out,
That person loses the challenge.
We also did a video over on mel's channel.
If you guys wanna check it out after this one.
We did truth or dare, got pretty crazy.
So yeah go check it out.
Also subscribe to her channel.
Thank you. - she's pretty awesome.
Also wanna let you guys know i'm doing a giveaway.
On my channel right now.
I'm giving away a macbook.
So if you guys wanna win that,
Let me know by liking this video.
Comment down below what's your favorite video.

And of course, you must be subscribed to this channel.
Without any further adieu, let's knock out some teeth.
