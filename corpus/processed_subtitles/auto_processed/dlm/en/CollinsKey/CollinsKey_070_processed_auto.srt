I am over 140 feet in the air right now.
Because elmer's asked us,
"what if we made slime in the most extreme conditions.".
So you challenged us to make slime upside down,
In an earthquake simulator, and a 140 foot bungee jump.
So right now, let's take the leap.
Here we go.
This is the jump.
Bro, my heart is beating so fast.
All right, here we go.
Three, two, one.
Got all the glue, - yes.
And now it's time to make the slime.
That we are gonna be using.
When we go off of the bungee jump drop.
That is a whole bunch.
Of course, there's gonna be a whole bunch.
Of different approaches that we have.
Yes.
I have a couple of specific slimes in mind.
That i think are gonna be perfect,
Get the perfect stretch.
I'm honestly already very nervous for this jump.
My slime is probably gonna be way cooler.
Than your slime. just sayin'.
What.
I think it's gonna reflect in the light and everything.
What. - as i'm like falling and.
Plunging towards the earth.
All right well here we go.
You add that in, i'll keep adding in mine over here.
I think i might've added too much glue.
Do you need some glue.
Um. no.
Whoa whoa whoa.
Do you need this here.
Hey, hey, hey this is my magical liquid, devan.
You can not have this stuff.
Fine. i will stay with my very special.
Metallic magical activator here.
Wait, can i have that.
No, no it's mine.
This is actually a super new, cool,
Metallic, magical liquid.
Your slime is not gonna stand up to mine at all.
I don't believe you.
Okay, here we go, it's time to mix it up,
We've got the net of glory over here.
Let's just pop this in here like this.
Yes, that's looking great.
Oh man, alright, well that's enough with the net.
I hope that's not a foreshadowing.
Of what's gonna happen with the bungee cord.
'cause that's not very good right there, so here we go.
Oh, i think i added way too much glue, dude.
I forgot that we're making two of these.
Yeah, we're making two slimes.
'cause we're gonna be mixing them midair,
And then depositing them down.
Into the "what if" elmer's bucket.
You know what, i think i'm gonna use some of this glue.
For my next slime here, so i'm just gonna.
Transfer the buckets.
Oh you're gonna add like different magical liquid into it.
Yeah, exactly dude, this looks awesome.
For a second, i thought you were a superhero there, man.
Your hands turned all metallic, and i thought.
That your whole body was gonna turn metallic.
Or something man.
Yup, i made my own sound effects.
What. i think this is gonna be.
The winning color right here, for sure.
I mean you can just see, it's obscuring devan,
And that's how good it is.
Whoa, first bottle down.
Dude, look at my slime, it worked out so good.
As you know it has to be collins-proof,
That means it has to be able to make it through anything,
So right now it's the make it through anything test,
So here we go.
I hope i make it through this test, jeez.
Got it in my slime.
It made it through, alright yeah this is definitely.
Bungee jump ready, so here we go.
Now i got some holographic powder i'm gonna add in.
Collins that's gonna get everywhere.
When you're falling, bro, there's gonna be.
So much light hitting it, it's gonna look insane.
I know it's probably gonna be the coolest slime.
I've ever made.
You can hold my bowl, i want to do a practice round.
For when we actually go for the bungee jump,
And i gotta make it into it.
If i miss, please move. alright you ready.
Together three, two, one.
Like that. and then, you got this.
Here we go, here we go.
Devan. devan, you missed.
Oh. are you kidding me. what, you said please move.
I meant like move to catch it.
Oh, oh that's what you meant, i'm sorry, my bad.
Just do it one more time and i got you.
Unbelievable, pinky promise.
You're gonna actually catch it, okay.
Together three, two, one.
Are you kidding me.
That had so much force to it.
Do not try this at home, this is not safe yet.
All i gotta say is, if that's any indication.
Of the force that my slime will be coming down with,
It may shatter the elmer's "what if" bucket.
Click over here to vote right now if you think.
That's what's gonna happen.
And let's make the next slime.
Now if you thought my first slime was cool,
This slime is gonna be even better.
Not to flex, devan, i've got color changing slime bro,
With this glue right here.
Oh yeah, you do.
And as you can tell, we've got these watermelons over here,
.
I wanna test how high.
That bungee jump is by yeeting these watermelons.
Off of the top of it.
Alright so right now let's go test these out.
Oh my gosh.
Dude, just you getting harnessed is making me nervous.
Holy cow, okay so they got the giant cord now.
All right, this is getting.
Realer and realer by the second.
I can confirm, it has been clicked in,
And it's screwed on.
It's looking good.
I can't see it though.
He did one of these on it.
I hope this isn't a prank video.
You promise it's not a prank video.
I promise this is not a prank video.
Okay, that would not be good.
I promise you.
Alright, yup, secure.
That didn't seem like you checked,
You barely touched it.
He checked it first.
Okay but bro come on.
You like barely touched it.
We've got watermelon number one.
And watermelon number two.
We've got wo friendly watermelons,
As you guys know we love watermelons.
We've definitely smashed a lot of them,
So let's do something we've never done.
And today we smash some more.
Exactly.
Initial predictions, devan,
How far do you think the watermelon's gonna splat.
I think it's gonna go all the way to the outer ring.
Alright so here we go, this is happening.
This is getting real.
Hello. alright so let's see, all right.
I have to say, this is where i'm happy.
To be the younger brother.
I knew it was a cage, but i gotta say,
It's definitely a lot wobblier than i thought it would be,
Especially with two watermelons, man.
We're going up, man.
Oh man.
Dude, it's definitely getting real now,
'cause we just, yeah, are ascending.
This feels like a ride you'd find in an amusement park, man.
I can like see all of la out here. holy cow.
Can you hear me.
Yes, and you're gonna want to move back when i drop these.
I couldn't hear him at all.
I thought i was prepared for this.
Fam, i don't know if i'm prepared for this.
Yeah, this may be one of the scariest things.
I have ever been a part of.
This is like, so nerve-wracking.
Like, if you just look up, it's just a crane.
Oh my gosh, i'm like lowkey.
Starting to shake a little bit.
Don't tell devan, though, shh, we can not tell devan,
I gotta be brave big brother, okay.
Collins, can you hear me.
I see a hand waving, but i think that's ron's hand.
I don't think he can hear me.
I'm starting to shake. devan's gonna freak out, bro.
Cause here's the advantage that devan has, bro.
I'm the older brother so he gets to see me do it first.
Collins, i'm gonna step out.
I've got the watermelons, so let's see how this goes, man.
Ready. here we go, hold it over like this.
Alright here we go, three, two, one.
Oh man, it's coming down.
Oh my god.
What. did you see that.
It like touched that building and that building.
And that building.
Oh my gosh.
Did you see that. i saw that.
Are you going for another one.
Alright, guys, i've got the second watermelon.
'cause i gotta test this.
This is scientific method.
We've gotta see if it's really that big of a drop.
Let's see. three, two, one, yeet.
Devan oh, it's off. here we go.
Devan oh, dude.
Alright, we've gotta go back down there, get my slimes,
And oh my gosh.
Are you kidding me. there's no watermelon left.
My heart's beating so fast right now.
Ohh, man, i'm real nervous.
Dude that went literally everywhere.
Collins i thought the impact would be big, i gotta say,
And now being up there for the first time,
Very nerve-wracking, devan.
This space feels pretty large, when you're up there,
It's like this little tiny hole, you have to jump,
Like pencil dive into.
Oh man.
So let's keep making the slime, but i gotta say.
That i do think by the-.
Hold on, i gotta take a second.
You good.
Real nervous.
For what.
For the bungee jump, dude.
I thought you meant for like another watermelon smashing.
I'm like, it's not that big a deal.
Now it's time to add in the color-changing glue right now.
This stuff is literally like magic.
The uv rays change the color of this glue.
That's very cool as well.
Tt's a metallic slime dude.
Now time to add in the magical liquid.
Into the color-changing glue.
Oh my gosh, look at that on the inside.
Whoaaaa.
Because the sun layer wasn't covering it.
Here we go, we're gonna go for the one hand around,
Then switch stance, switch stance, switch stance.
It's the stance switch that makes a huge difference.
Dude it's crazy, look at how it's all yellow,
And it starts to change colors, man.
Alright well now it's time to add this all new, metallic,
Magical liquid.
You're gonna add it to me, devan, that almost got.
All over me, bro.
It's gonna be double metallic.
We prepared the perfect slime for bungee jumping,
But now it is time to prepare ourselves.
I've been told that bungee jumping is like.
Surviving an earthquake while being upside down.
So we've simulated both of those extreme conditions,
And now let's make some slime in them.
In preparation for our 140 foot bungee jump,
You challenged us to make slime-.
I've got to add some glue.
Whoa, the tremors stopped.
Okay, wow. this is going to be intense, man.
The point is that as we jump, we're gonna be shaking,
Going all over the place, so this is a good preparation,
You know.
Alright got all the beads over here-.
I caught some for you. that's for you.
Thank you.
If this is any indication of how shaky.
The bungee jump is gonna be, bro this is going to be insane.
Whoa, what was that.
I was trying to get more of the beads.
Alright i think i gotta start working on my slime over here,
I'm gonna add in some more metallic glue over here,
I enjoy when it's very stable in here, it's very nice.
Now we just gotta get some things to mix all this around,
We're going to add some of this metallic activator.
Wow, i am kind of nervous.
It's so slippery.
I will stabilize you, devan. you got it.
I got it, i got it.
Well, at least in the bungee jump.
There aren't gonna be a bunch of beads flying everywhere.
Just check out that stretch.
Yo, that is perfect man, that slime is gr-.
The pencils are on the ground.
I've lost it.
You're good, you're good.
I'll help you. i will help you.
Whoa, no. no.
If there's one thing i've learned,
It's that whenever the tremors start, you just gotta chill.
I had a bucket on the table where did it go.
Okay, it's down over there.
Save me. save me.
Come back. come back.
I've got it, i've got it. thank you.
Where's my elmer's glue, bro.
What do you mean. it's down there.
Fine.
Oh no, no, no.
I got it. i got it. pull me back. take me back.
I never thought i'd say this,
But i think i'm actually prepared for the bungee jump.
We're gonna put on this helmet.
Why did you just put the helmet on, man.
Take the glue. let's do it.
If the earthquake simulator starts, devan,
I'm just sayin', this might get all over you.
I don't think it'll start.
Three, two, one.
I'm trying.
I'm trying my best.
I'm doing my best. i've got it. i'm doing a great job.
I'm doing such a great job.
Okay, there we go,
And, i think we got it.
I mean in terms of where the glue ended up,
In terms of his proportions, not totally inside there.
You didn't get it in at all. what are you doing.
Look at this.
Bro.
That's quite a bit all things considered.
What if this happens to me on the bungee jump.
Now, while we're here i'm just gonna dump it.
Into the water, and hopefully it'll absorb on the inside.
This is gonna create a very cool texture.
Ta-da. for the slime.
Yeah. great job.
I really think this is gonna make a big difference,
So here we go.
Gonna add that in.
I'm gonna grab some of my slime, and use this slime.
To hold you in place.
So here we go. boom.
I'm gonna put this slime like a little backpack.
A little slime in the backpack, there we go.
And then mix it, mix it mix it.
There goes my slime, but don't you worry,
See that little bit on my finger.
That's all we need. here we go. okay.
Look at that. this is perfect.
Oh, how about you grab a side, i'll grab a side,
We'll both stretch it.
Together three, two, one.
Let's see how the slime looks. ready.
Yeah, here we go.
Together three, two one.
We've got the perfect slime, the experience.
Of being in an earthquake simulator, and now,
The only thing left before we do the bungee jump,
Is to make slime upside down, so let's go.
In preparation for the bungee jump,
Let's see what slime ingredients elmer's sent us.
Holy cow, that's a ton of ingredients,
And elmer's challenged us to make slime.
In the most extreme conditions.
What, like upside down.
Exactly, so right now devan let's um-.
Together we'll figure this out.
Yo, i've got my slime dude, this is nuts.
Oh no, it went down, i lost it all.
The only difference between this and the bungee jump.
Is that i'll be making slime while hurling.
Towards the ground.
That actually doesn't help me out at all.
This is metallic teal glue and confetti magical liquid.
And this is orange glitter and metallic magical liquid.
We're gonna add some ingredients, here we go.
So we got this, we're just gonna pop the top off.
Wait, lemme try to catch it.
Oh, you missed, you missed.
Okay there we go, there we go, dude.
This is insane.
We'll just grab some of this, aw that was a miss.
Oh. you missed. what are you doing, fam.
Grab some activator, just a little bit of activator.
Just a little bit more.
Holy cow, this is wild.
We can go fishing a little bit, you know.
Yo, yo, let's trade slimes.
Together three, two, one.
Wait, let's try to get it in the bucket.
Oh, that's a good idea.
What just happened.
Let me add this, let me add this.
Whoaaaa.
Holy cow.
This is crazy.
Alright well you know what, i think this is uh-.
This is like a dream.
We're making some new slimes here.
It's actually way harder than you think.
To make slime while hanging upside down.
I'm sorry, i'm sorry, three, two, one.
Alright here we go. look at my balloon.
Dude, wait get the balloon back, get it back.
Can you get it back.
Alright check this out bro, here we go.
Take the top off, it's a magic trick.
Together three, two, one.
You can't hit me bro, you can't hit me.
Look at that, look at that.
Ohh, you actually got it on me, what are you doing.
Alright well i think we got the experience.
Of being upside down, so now it's time for the next thing.
We've made the slimes, we're back here.
About to bungee jump.
Do not try this at home.
We have trained professionals here helping us do this.
First thing we gotta do right now.
Is just get into the harness.
And you're going first.
Collins it's a new fashion statement guys.
Devan you're gonna look good collins,
You're gonna look good.
Thank you, man, i can tell.
Alright, so guys, for this part, i stick my arms out.
Okay, this is the second harness.
Because again, the bungee is gonna be on my back,
So i'm gonna be going stomach first.
So all i'm seeing on my way down is just the ground.
Rushing towards my face.
And the slime that's in your hands.
Exactly.
I'm feeling the tugging, so we're good.
We got the thumbs-up.
Here are the slimes that you made, it is getting real man.
So, i guess these are the slimes.
That i'll be mixing on the way down.
Time to board the machine.
This is my last time on the ground.
Before i bungee jump.
Devan, any final words.
Good luck.
Thank you, man.
Climb up here.
Alright dude here you go.
And again, huge shout out to elmer's.
For sponsoring this video.
There is no way we would've been able to do this.
Without elmer's glue because their glue.
Is what makes the slime able to be mixed.
As we're beungee jumping.
So we wanna see what you can do with elmer's glue.
A whole bunch of crazy things.
Maybe not bungee jumping,
But we know you can make some awesome slimes.
So right now it's time to go up, and make some slimes.
Don't tell him we're talking about him,
But, uh, he doesn't look so good right now.
Alright, we are going up.
Right now, i got all the slimes here.
I've already had to be up here once, so i'm already.
A little bit scared of what this is gonna be like.
Oh my gosh, bungee jumping is one thing,
Trying to mix slime and bungee jump at the same time.
Is a whole different ordeal, man.
That's like a whole level of concentration,
And the ground is getting smaller and smaller.
Devan you good. are you doing okay.
I don't know.
Devan can you hear me.
I can hear you. it's pretty scary up here bro.
Devan it's really, really, real now.
Oh, it's really real now, devan.
There is no turning back.
Exactly, and worst of all i still forgot,
I still have to try to aim for a bucket.
Can you wave to me.
Hi.
He's now a tiny little speck in the sky.
Help me, help.
It's a whole different ballgame up here.
When you're down there, you're like,
Wow, what a large space we're in.
When you're up here, you're like oh, it's not that big.
Feeling like a little hole you're trying to jump into man.
Alright guys so the moment has come.
Time for me to pick up these slimes,
And we're just gonna be jumping off.
Bro, my heart is beating so fast.
Holy cow, i am so nervous right now.
Dude, i think i can see the beach and my house from here,
This is one of the best views in all of los angeles.
Unfortunately, the only way to get down is by jumping.
Oh jeez, i'm nervous for myself 'cause i'm gonna have to.
Do this in just a moment.
Alright here we go, about to grab the first slime.
Boom. there we go we've got it.
Here we go, about to grab the second slime.
Boom. here we go.
Oh, he's stepping towards the plank.
He's stepping towards the platform.
Got the two slimes, as you can tell, and now.
This is the jump.
Yeah, this is nuts.
Alright here we go, three,
Two,
One.
Oh my gosh, this is the scariest thing ever.
Oh my gosh.
Oh my gosh.
I can't even see the bucket. there it is.
Oh my goodness, i was not ready. i was not ready at all.
Holy cow. yeet.
Ohhh, and he missed.
All of that, and he missed.
I did my best bro.
That was the scariest thing i have ever done.
When you get up there, you will see.
It is very hard to hit the bucket, okay devan.
Like, i gotta say, that was actually pretty close.
Devan i believe you.
I'm surprised i got that close.
Devan you are very brave.
Thank you.
Bravo, bravo.
So this is it, this is the slime, and i gotta say guys,
I know, it looks like quite a large margin,
But when you are that high in the air,
I'm shocked i even got it this close.
Devan that was actually pretty close.
That was actually pretty close.
I think i have a different method, though.
I think i'm gonna try something different.
Yeah, if i do it at all, 'cause that was terrifying.
It's a different ballgame when you're up there.
I'm already not a fan of this, you know.
Like that feeling that you get when you're falling.
Did you get that feeling.
It's more the psychological element of it,
'cause you're just watching the ground rush towards you.
I was just trying to do my best,
I lost some pieces of it bro.
You lost like half of it, it's over there, over there.
In my defense, the wind is rushing past you.
Look at how far that went.
In all honesty, that could've been the slime that i aimed,
But instead i got it, like that's pretty close.
I wanna see you do closer man.
We're leaving that there to see if you can do closer.
Oh jeez.
So guys if that's where mine landed,
And i'm the one who just kinda jumped headfirst into things,
Where do you think devin's slime is gonna land.
Comment down below, will it hit the tarp,
Will it hit outside, or is it gonna hit.
Somewhere completely else in los angeles.
So comment down below right now.
Alright it's my turn, here we go.
Oh man, the heart is just going so fast.
Oh my gosh, your face looks a little pale,
I do have to say right now.
Well i did put on sunscreen, so maybe it's that.
Hopefully it's just that.
Collins you have a separate strategy.
On how you're planning on mixing your slime.
You know, i think i'm just gonna have to wing it, man.
It's gonna be crazy, i don't know how i'm gonna.
Concentrate on that and also not concentrate,
I'm about to, you know, smack the ground.
If i can give you one tip, it's when you go out,
It's like the whole kind of thing is like moving.
It's swaying a little bit,
So it makes it feel even a little bit scarier.
Because there's this whole added motion.
Thanks. appreciate that.
So you go, these are the slimes.
I think i did a good job, right.
He did a good job on the slimes, but now the question is,
Is he going to be able to mix them.
Hold on, i gotta tighten my helmet. it's a little loose.
Safety is extremely important as we're doing this.
You good.
Yep, it's gonna work.
Alright here we go.
Alright devan's hopping on.
Give me a high five.
You got this bro.
Thank you very much.
I believe in you devan.
Thank you, i'm actually not nervous yet.
Just let me know when you start to get nervous.
Okay, do you have the bullhorn.
Grab the bullhorn.
Okay, grab it.
Devan what's the verdict.
You guys are lucky, you get to just watch.
It's terrifying.
So far, this is a beautiful view.
Just look over the edge real quick.
That is just terrifying, and it doesn't look as scary.
On camera as it does in real life.
Is it getting a little bit scarier, devan.
Not a little bit. actually, quite a lot a bit.
Yeah, you're getting pretty high up there now, devan.
Uh huh, and we're not even to the top yet.
When i got to that point, i was like tripping out.
He seems to be handling it a lot better than i was.
Dude. i am terrified.
I can only imagine what's going through his head right now.
Was collins this scared. this is like mind-boggling.
Just look over the edge real quick.
I got people in like apartments watching me.
What is going on.
Right now i'm sure he's getting instructions and stuff.
Bro, i was just stalling up there.
Everything i could think of,
Like how could i possibly stall this situation.
Just a moment longer.
Is it good to go now, even though my heart's going crazy.
Oh yeah, absolutely.
Alright here we go, i am about to jump.
Collins, can you see me.
Collins you got this bro.
Dude, this is crazy.
Comment down below, "you got this devan." 'cause i need it.
Devan. devan. you got this bro.
You ready.
Just his little head pops out over the edge, oh my gosh.
Devan, you got your slime right.
I got my slime.
Cause otherwise, you're gonna have to do this again.
All right, i'm grabbing my slime right now.
It feels very unstable, i have to say.
He isn't ready.
How long of a drop is it. like two seconds.
Three seconds. four seconds.
140 feet of fun.
Here's my slime.
Alright he's going for it. this one's for real, guys.
Here we go, three, two, one.
Collins oh my gosh. oh my gosh.
Oh my goodness.
Collins holy cow.
That was insane.
I got a little of the slime, no.
That was the scariest thing i've ever done.
Can i make this little bit of slime.
See if you can get that little bit of slime in the bucket,
You've still got a chance, devan.
See if i can make it, see if i can make it.
Oh man, that was close.
Dude, you were right, that was the scariest thing.
I've ever done.
I gotta give you credit bro,
That's a super scary thing to do, man.
So nicely done.
Hand me the slime, thank you, i'm gonna dunk it.
That is cheating. you cannot do that man.
That does not count, no, no, no.
Are you good.
No, i'm not, it's slippery.
Well, i gotta say, i think my slime barely.
Got a little bit closer bro.
Devan i think it did. you did a better job.
Collins but how was that.
Devan that was terrifying. what was that, man.
Collins was it fun, though.
Devan it was super fun, like once you're weightless.
Man, that was super fun.
It's just getting over the first hump,
That's the craziest part.
= so how about this, since we both were not able.
To get the slime into the bucket,
Let's combine our two slimes, mix them together.
Brother power, like this.
On the count of three, we'll both dunk it in the bucket.
You ready. all right, here we go, here we go.
Together three, two, one.
Yes. - boom, there we go, guys.
So thank you so much for watching, and a huge thank you.
To elmer's for making all of this possible.
What if elmer's challenged you to make extreme slime.
What slime would you make.
Comment that down below right now,
And if you want to see another video,
Click right over here.
You got five seconds, here we go.
Together five, four, three, two, one, done.
Love you. together bye.
