What's up, it's collins key and welcome to my new video.
Now, for today's video i've got some special guests.
Who are going to be joining me.
First of all, everyone please welcome the.
Beautiful merrell twins.
Hey.
Hello, say hello.
And actually, you know what,
Instead of just having the merrell twins,
I've got one more special guest.
I thought he jumped out already.
Everyone please welcome my little brother, devan key.
All yay.
What's up.
How are you.
We've got the whole squad assembled and today we're.
Going head to head challenging each other right now.
It's going to be the key bros versus--.
Both the merrell twins.
All yay.
We are going to be doing the candy cane taste-testing.
Challenge; so basically we had a third party, my dad,
Go out to the store and buy a whole bunch of.
Different flavored candy canes.
We don't know what flavors these candy canes are.
One person on each team is going to be blindfolded,
The other person is going to feed them the candy cane.
And that person has to guess what flavor it is.
Whichever team guesses, i like your interpretation--.
We were demonstrating what you were saying.
I like it; so whichever team guesses correctly first,
That team wins that round.
Whichever team wins the majority of the rounds,
They win the overall challenge.
And the prize is a giant pez santa claus.
What.
It's a musical--.
Musical.
All ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
All right, okay.
Is there a sample.
No sample.
The winner gets to discover the wonders.
Of the musical dispenser.
Also they win this legit lightsaber right here.
I don't want to do just an ordinary candy cane.
Taste testing thing, i gotta take it up a notch.
We're combining the candy cane taste testing with.
The bean boozled challenge.
How the bean boozled challenge ties into all this.
Is that whichever team guesses incorrectly,
They both have to eat, i'm pointing at you guys,
They both have to eat one of the bean boozled beans.
You're either gonna get a good flavor or a bad flavor.
That's really going to mess with your tastebuds.
For the rest of the challenge, so that's basically.
How it works.
Also, i'm doing a giveaway on my channel right now.

We've gotta do our bean boozled thing.
I'm not ready for this.
I'm not either.
I'm doing two.
Noooo.
Mine tastes really good, like toothpaste.
It's not toothpaste, it's earwax.
