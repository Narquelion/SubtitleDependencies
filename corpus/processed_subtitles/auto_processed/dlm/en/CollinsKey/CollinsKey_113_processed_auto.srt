Yo.
You challenged us to turn food into slime.
Right now, let's go.
Whoa you can't eat that.
Oh my gosh.
Whoa bro, why.
For this round we'll be making a watermelon slime,
So right now check this out.
Bam just like that we cut it in half.
So we took our ice cream scoopers.
Because i don't think we have actual,
Like, watermelon scoopers.
Let's see if we can just.
Woo.
So to kick it out i got some clear glue right here.
I'm gonna add actual watermelon juice to mine.
We're not eating it collin,
You don't have to go the extra step.
Collin more watermelon.
Boo, boo, boo.
Those were the air horns.
Ohh.
The reason i'm going to win devan.
Is because my slime is now watermelon scented.
So i'm going to add the contact solution in.
Yo.
Okay, so we're getting into the club club phase now,
And not.
Quite looking sticky enough.
Oh, it's finally done.
And now mine has turned into a bowl of like,
Ramen noodles man.
Devan those don't look like ramen noodles.
I, well, yeah.
Did i not bring this back from the abyss or what.
Now that my slime is all rescued,
Boy.
I didn't know if i would make it to this point,
So now it's time for kind of the crazy x-factor,
And that is.
Watermelon.
Devan what.
Collin boom.
So now we're gonna mix all this watermelon into my slime.
Bro, this feels so crazy.
It's definitely not edible,
But boy is it gonna smell good.
Ohhhh, check it out.
I think the watermelon might've, like, broken down.
My slime to where it's no longer able to be slimy,
'cause now it's just kinda like thick glue at the moment.
Whoa, dude it looks so good.
Bro.
So now the final stage,
We gotta fill up our watermelon bowls with slime.
So i'm gonna do the official like scoop-a-doop.
Oooh.
And then kinda put it in here,
Oh.
Just plop it in the top there.
Tada.
There you have a nice, juicy-- overflowing.
Don't do that.
Uh oh.
Dude mine looks awesome.
Both yoooo.
Collin so those are the final watermelon slimes,
Comment down below who you think won this round.
You challenged us to make a cupcake out of slime,
So right now we put our baking outfits on.
Baking outfits.
Wait.
Baking outfits.
Baking outfits.
Woo hoo.
Dude, you look so cute right now.
Seriously, look at this apron bro.
Cute and adorable are not the words.
I want to be described with.
Yeet.
Yeet.
Let's go.
That was way too excited.
Yeah, jeez.
So guys, basically for the cupcake slime.
It's super easy.
Dude, what did i just say.
All you got to do is just add some glue.
Boop.
And then you're just wanna grab some sta-flo.
Pop that right in,
Bam.
Too much sta-flo.
I think i need some more glue.
Ugh, there we go.
Drippity drip, you know.
So basically there's gonna be.
Three components for this cupcake,
And as you guys can see, this is.
Dude it's starting to get like all mucus-y again.
This is what you call the high pour off the high dive.
The what.
Collin oh nailed it.
Where was the high dive though.
It's up there somewhere.
Oh, oh.
I see it.
Whoa.
Oh man, it's stuck to my hands.
A slime,
Ugh.
You're really good at making a mess dude.
Devan, you know i have to go to my.
Patented technique, you know,
The double hand rollover to rollover double hand.
What.
Since when was that your patented technique.
Yo.
It's getting stretchy.
Oh no, it's starting to split.
My slime is not made yet.
Oy.
Dude i did too much talking and now look at mine.
That's wack.
Devan karma.
It looks like a, a, a.
Not good.
No, no, no, no, no.
No.
I wanted to give you a hat though.
No.
It would've been a fashion accessory.
That's already happened before and no.
This is like my most like slippery slime ever.
It's almost like a yo--.
Oh.
Gosh.
Oh.
Oh.
Sorry man, did not mean to do that.
Why.
Now it's time to add some coloring,
So we got some acrylic paint and now time to add it.
Yeah that's definitely how you add it guys.
Yo wait a minute bro.
It's actually working.
Oh.
Snap.
Look at that color right there man,
This is turning into batter.
Mine didn't work, look.
Mine's still in a bottle.
Devan, you're not a sorcerer bro.
Look at this.
Dude how did yours work.
Well i guess i'm just going to have.
To do it the normal way.
Going in,
Just gonna go, go, go.
Oh no.
I got the paint everywhere.
Bro what are you doing.
This smells terrible dude.
Dude.
And my hands are all pasty.
Looks like my hands haven't been in the sun.
For a couple hundred years.
This looks like when you first.
Put on sunscreen and you don't mix it in.
Dude, the more you stretch it out,
The more it looks like batter bro.
Devan boom.
We've now got our.
Oops.
Nooo.
Oh no, i actually got real cupcake on mine.
Devan no.
So here we go, we've got our cupcake base,
And now we're just gonna put a certain amount.
Of this batter slime in.
Yo this is actually pretty cool right here.
Devan yeah.
Trick shot.
Oh.
Prime number one is done for the base of the cupcake,
And now it's time--.
For slime number two.
For this next slime,
Just fill up the cupcake container thingy with some glue.
Devan okay.
That's actually working quite well.
Measurement number two,
Gotta add 14 teaspoon,
Ow,
Of baking soda.
Dude why do you do that every time.
Yeah.
That's not a lot at all.
Next up is a tablespoon of lotion.
Collin this is a very slow dispense.
Devan slow process.
So i counted that,
It was approximately.
12 squirts of lotion.
And finally, contact solution.
I don't want to get my hands dirty,
I've got my little sticks.
I had my lil' sticks.
Agh.
Boom, nailed it.
Eeeh.
Ugh.
Oh.
Holy cow.
Wow.
It got all over me.
Wow.
Well my slime on a stick is looking mighty fine,
So i think it's time for the next ingredient.
Which is, devan, guess.
Clay.
No.
Bummer, what is it.
Clay.
It is.
You guessed right.
Yay.
Here we go,
We got the clay.
Oh man this clay feels nice.
So here's what we gotta do now.
Use my stick,
Oh i broke my stick again.
Ohh.
Dude, you hear those pops.
Whoa, yours is looking awesome bro.
Yeah man.
Oh.
It's a really good slime.
Like it doesn't crack or anything,
Look at this.
The final step,
Time to add some pink acrylic paint to it.
Mm yes.
So again, technique goes,
Pop the bottle in the middle.
Oh it's starting to work again.
Look at this,
There's like a giant bubble of it right here, devan,
I'm about to split the bubble of paint.
Are you ready.
Ohhh.
Dude it's about to like bust open right now,
And then it's all gonna be all pink.
It looks like a pink cloud bro.
Agh.
Yo.
Yo my butter slime is like falling apart.
There we go.
Nice.
Saucy.
The frosting is now made,
It's time for the final part,
Which is the sprinkles.
We've got a whole bunch of little clay packets.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
What is up with this clay.
It's like taffy.
This is so crazy.
Whoa.
So it's going to start on the otter rim.
Woo.
Keep going in.
Oops and then here.
Okay i'm finishing mine off with a massive blueberry.
Bam.
It's on top of my cupcake.

And right now we are on to the next one.
Man that looks mad funky.
Next up we're making one of our favorite foods.

Sushi.
Oh yeah.
So we've got some beads right here for the rice.
Oopsie.
So i'm gonna dump all these in first.
Yo.
Alright now time for the big beads.
Oh.
I'm actually going to use a chopstick to mix this around.
Oh, yeah.
This is looking good.
Here we go, time to add some glue now.
Both ugh.
There we go.
You know when you haven't like.
Walked in sand in a long time and it kind of like.
Really, really tickles your toes.
It's tickling my hands.
Oh, this feels weird.
Oh my gosh, this is one of the weirdest.
Things i've ever felt.
Ooooh.
Whenever we make slime it always just turns into noises,
We're like ooooh.
Ughhhh.
Whoa.
Alright i think i might need a little bit more.
Sta-flo but my rice is like almost there.
Man, look at mine.
It's pretty much perfect.
Man whoa.
Collin you have like the perfect ratio.
Of slime to beads to sta-flo.
Oh yeah.
Oh.
Yo, i just had a great idea.
What's that.
I'm gonna make like one huge piece of sushi.
They always say that rice is the heart of sushi,
So i'm going to make mine look like.
A heart.
That does not look like a heart.
Collin it's got a little dippy thing.
It doesn't look like a heart at all.
And we'll fold over the bottom like this,
It's a towel.
Oh, okay.
Yoo hoo.
Ow.
This is gonna be my salmon.
Alright.
Oop, whoa.
So i got it now and now i'm gonna shape it like a salmon.
So here it is,
My first strip of fish.
Ohh, nice.
Lovely.
This one here devan, you know what this is.
What.
My yellow tail.
Oh.
I'm not really feeling how my.
Sushi's coming out right now,
So i got to add some real pieces of sushi.
So we've got piece number one.
Devan oh.
Piece number two.
And then of course you've always got.
To add a little bit of ginger to your sushi.
Because that's a pallette cleanser.
Fun fact.
And then of course, some wasabi,
Just smear it across the bottom like that.
There we go.
If i didn't know better,
I would literally say that is sushi right there,
And i might accidentally eat it,
So right now,
Here's the big reveal.
You ready.
Both three, two, one.
Tada.
Look at that.
So good.
That looks so good.
Dude, i would eat that.
And i can't,
'cause it's slime.
Collin that looks insane.
The thing is mine is a sushi roll,
Which means what is it missing devan.
Uh, the roll.
The roll.
So check it out here we go.
Gonna roll it up.
Devan oh i didn't actually think.
You were going to do it.
You're actually doing it.
Now we're going to fold over one side like this,
And now i guess it's time to mix it altogether.
Ohhh, look you can like see all the little sushis in there.
Oh, snap.
Dude the wasabi is like coming all out of it.
Why would you do this.
What.
Where'd all the yellow come from.
Remember you had a yellow tail in there.
Oh right, right, right.
So you get to comment down below, who won this round,
And right now we are on to the next one.
This one, we're making ice cream,
So right now we're gonna kick it off with a small batch.
So i'm only.
Oop, no, no, no, i'm only trying to do a little bit.
Done.
Now time to add the sta-flo in.
That should be enough.
We're got a cone, oh an ice cream sandwich,
Or we could make a sundae.
Yeehoo.
Somehow the top of this sta-flo thing ended up in mine.
It was me.
I have a glove.
Time to add my clay in.
Ohh.
Man my hands are getting cramped.
Oh.
I wonder if i could like, use my forearms to do my slime.
Ugh.
That sounds like my slime is ready to go.
Woo, woo, woo, bam.
Now i have my slime all broken out,
And it's time to add some coloring.
Oh no, no, no, i'm getting it all over the table.
Oh no, my hands are going to be so green.
Alright i'm going to add some blue to mine.
To see what happens.
Ugh.
Dude your hands are going to be so blue.
Nooo.
You look like a smurf.
What have i done.
I'm doing this successfully i think.
Devan whoa, it looks really cool.
Both whoaaa.
Alright mine is done,
And it gets the thumbs up approval.
Dude it looks like gray, just saying.
Now for the final part,
Time to actually make the ice cream.
Fist, i am doing strawberry added in,
And second i'm doing some purple.
You can't take mine.
No.
Devan look at that.
Here we go, i'm going to have some.
Mint on this side over here,
We've got the orange,
The yellow for the lemon flavor.
Whoa.
Looking good.
Bam, and then done.
There's my ice cream sundae.
There's my ice cream sandwich,
And then here's my ice cream sundae.
Ice cream sundae, looking more like an ice cream monday.
Oooh.
Now for some whipped cream.
No, that's not fair.
Oh.
Yes.
That looks so bad.
Alright well whatever.
Devan just ignore that.
Comment down below who won this round.
Now time to take all the colors and mix them altogether.
Yeah, woo.
Three, two, one, stretch it.
Both whoaaa.
We're making the sweetest slime ever,
This is honey slime.
So right now, let's go.
This one's pretty easy.
Basically you just have clear glue,
And then going to add some clear contact solution,
Just gonna pop the top off.
Is there any other kind--.
Oh.
I wasted a little bit, which is not good,
Because i need as much as i can possibly get.
Oh.
There you go.
Nice.
Now we have these little like honey stirrer things.
That are really cute that we can use to mix it around.
So there we go.
Look at that.
Collin this is so awesome.
Alright it's time to get the hands in there.
Oh.
Dude i did not add enough contact solution man.
You might need to use some sta-flo.
Yep, mine's definitely a little bit milky now.
Hmm.
Boomin' now, i am one with the bees.
Wait what.
I am now a bee, devan.
Okay.
Buzz.
Okay, alright.
There's the sound.
Buzz.
Okay, alright.
Just a couple drops of bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.
I mean, buzzzzz.
Both yo.
Devan that looks so good.
Collin this looks just like golden honey.
Bro, nicely done.
Thank you, it's because i'm one with the bees.
I guess, yeah.
Wait, i know like putting the bee hat on.
Would maybe like attract some bees,
But like.
Both whoa.

But steve was sayin' hello.
Steve the bee hi.
Yeah, well steve, goodbye.
Uh buzz.
Dude, this looks so much like honey,
This looks so cool.
Even though it's super simple,
This is one of my favorite slimes we've ever made.
Especially with this little stick thing here,
I mean i don't know what, is this like a honey comb stick,
It looks super cute.
Buzz.
I was just buzzing 'cause my thingy went like floppin'.
Devan alright, mine is ready to add to the jar.
Alright so we just gotta open up our jars,
Woohoo.
Oop.

Oh my goodness, that looks so good.
There we go, my honey is done.
Oh my gosh, it's like right to the top.
I love it.
I'm so happy.
It's so beautiful.
Oh my gosh.

Collin oh.
Devan that looks so good.
So guys this is it.
Oh, look at that.
This is what the honey slime looks like, oh my gosh.
So guys, comment down below.
Who made a better one.
This one's actually going to be a.
Legitimately tough competition,
But right now let's buzz into the next round.
Alright.
This round we're making an edible.
Peanut butter and jelly sandwich,
But it's going to be made out of slime,
So right now, let's make some edible slime.
Woohoo.
Whoa, bro.
That was my lunch.
I'm sorry.
I'm making the jelly.
And i'm making the peanut butter.
You okay.
I need six tablespoons of jelly.
And i'm just gonna do, i don't know,
Maybe like six of these.
I'm just gonna eyeball it, you know.
Two.
Man i forgot how much i love jelly.
Jelly's amazing.
And now i just need nine tablespoons of corn starch.
And now i gotta add this light corn syrup.
So this acts like the glue,
And this acts like the liquid starch.
That's my revelation.
So now i'm going to mix it around.
I'm just going in with my hands,
So here we go guys.
Ohhh.
Alright next up, i have to add one teaspoon of cornstarch.
Alright well i guess that now we just.
Have to hope that this works,
Story of my life.
Yes.
Dude.
That's like actually turning into slime.
I know right.
It's kind of some chunky, funky peanut butter.
Well hey, you know people like chunky peanut butter.
See the issue is that, it's just kind of coating my hands.
Like it's just like all over my fingers.
Could you please give me a little bit.
More cornstarch into my palms.
Is that enough>.
No.
You could just dab it in there bro.
This didn't quite go according to plan.
It's just goop.
Alright, so here we go.
I'm gonna try to smear this.
Off of my hands onto that.
You know, i'm gonna go like this,
Turn it into a nice little patty,
Alright well here we go, you know,
I'm going to try to spread my jelly on the top here,
That's not working.
Usually, peanut butter is the one.
That has trouble spreading.
But now it's jelly.
Both ohhhh.
I feel the chunks.
Great.
It actually kind of looks like it's some sort of ice cream.
I just realized this has been all over your hands,
I don't know if i want to eat this.
Don't worry, i washed my hands.
Devan there we go.
Collin boom.
Dude, i can feel the peanut butter.
Being really, really solid.
It's like cardboard's in the middle of my sandwich.
