Let's go.
Oh my god.
Whoa.
All right guys, let's do this.
It's so much slime.
Oh my gosh, are you okay.
Are you okay. - oh my gosh.
Instead of dumping each packet of slime.
Individually into the pool,
We filled up these buckets right here.
With a ton of the powder,
And stick around till the very end.
Because we will fully submerge ourselves.
In the slime at the end of the video.
But right now, let's make the slime.
We gotta put this back.
This is so much slime.
Safety is a number one priority, clearly.
Oops.

We lost half of it. - oh my gosh.
This gets so slippery.

You're pulling me.
Everyone gets one attempt.
And you guys decide in the comments who won.
Ava goes first.

Immediate disqualification.

And this side, i guess, it's ava and i.
Versus devan, christian, and bella.
All right, let's get it.
How this works,
Whichever team goes down first, they are the losers,
And they have to get blasted in the face.
With a squirt gun filled of slime.
All what.
Here we go.
We're going in three, two, one, go.
No, that doesn't count.
It doesn't count, it doesn't count, no.

Christian it's collins with the lead.
I can't do anything.

That was so close.
Yes, now just bella's left.
That was underdog, a true underdog victory.
Christian i'm sorry guys, i'm sorry.
Let's get the squirt guns.
All right, so we're gonna hop out of the pool.
And then squirt them from outside the pool,
'cause victory.
But how long, though.
I can only take so much.
I'm trying to get all this off of me.
I got you, i got you.
Collins all right, here we go.
I'm gonna fill it up.
I got you . - oh my gosh, it's working.
No, that's not a good sign.
That's not a good sign.
Here we go, three, two, one.

I need to try it again, i need to try it again.
Yes.
Woo-hoo.
You know, forget this.
It's not going anywhere.
Oopsy.
Get away, get away.
Ava's a maniac.
Oh jeez. - oh no.
Get his hair, get his hair.
Coming for devan's hair.
I got ava, i'm sorry.
Oh my gosh.
Well.
My stomach is hurting.
I'm laughing so hard.
All right, guys, i think we go on to the next challenge.
I'm sorry, bro.
Ah, it touched my mouth.
Guys, guys, guys, look. - what.
Look how much slime is in my hair.
All whoa.
That is so gross.
What does it feel like, though.
Is it, like, just super.
It's soft.
It's like smooth - wait, hold on.
I wonder if it's good for your hair.
I can't even feel your hair.
Like, i can't feel the individual strands.
It's like a string of the slime.
Yeah, it's like a giant string of slime.
Oh, that is awesome.
What.
For this final part here,
We are going to be doing a king of the hill battle.
On this massive duck right here,
And so, at the end of 30 seconds,
Whoever is still left on the duck,
If i can even get it in here,
They win the battle, all right.
