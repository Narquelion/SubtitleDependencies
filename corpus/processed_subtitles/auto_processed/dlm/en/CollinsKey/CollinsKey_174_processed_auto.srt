Three books on our head and balance them.
And go to that wall over there without dropping them.
Now if you drop your books, it's automatic disqualification.
I'm good.
I'm good--.
Which will not be good.
I didn't mean that, that hit you.
Bro, i had that.
My hair looks like a soccer mom by the way, guys.
Alright, cool.
Just lost my hair.
Me and my hair .
I'm going, i'm going, i'm going.
No no no wait, it's tickling my armpit.
That doesn't count, it doesn't count.
Alright i got it, oh that doesn't count,
That doesn't count, i got this.
This isn't fair, bro.
I got this, i got it, it doesn't count.
There we go.
No.
This is great, you know, i'm not holding it at all.
See, i'm not holding it.
I got automatic disqualification.
That didn't go according to plan.
Make sure you read your books, kids.
Joking, alright.
Well i lost my hair, i lost my books,
And from what devan said, i didn't see him at all,
But he says he didn't cheat so he won fair and square.
I didn't cheat at all, we're good.
I lose round one.
Alright round two, let's get it.
Let's do it.
This is the little mermaid challenge.
As you guys know, the little mermaid loves.
Collecting human items.
For this, we are going to be using forks.
Devan, do you have a fork.
This is my fork.
This is my fork.
I don't think this is quite fair,
Because you have a much bigger fork than i do.
I think this is great.
For this, we're gonna do rock, paper, scissors.
To see who gets the bigger fork.
Put your fork down.
Ready, rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
I win.
I get the big fork.
Three, two, one, go.
That's my fork.
Okay, whoever gets all his rope on their fork first wins.
I win, i win, i win.
Good game.
I won.
No no no no no no no fam, i won that round.
I won this one.
After watching the instant replay,
It does appear as though devan did get his fork in the air.
Before i did, so devan did--.
I did.
Yeah, so you take the win this one.
Yeah.
Yay.
I just messed up our yard, bro.
This is the snow white challenge.
For this, we have a whole bunch of poison apples.
And it's whoever can eat the most poison apples.
In 30 seconds, i know it kinda goes against the whole story.
But whatever.
Alright, three, two, one, go.
Oh no.
I'm sorry.
What.
Don't know how i fit one and quarter apples.
In my mouth but.
I win so we gucci.
Don't you hate it when your headphones get tangled.
This that relatable moments here.
Whoever can untangle their headphones first,
They win this challenge, so go.
Okay.
Alright well i'm going for this kind of like.
Grab everything technique.
I don't have a technique so i'm just going.
Getting so close, getting so close, yeah.
Now just the two little headphones, what are you doing fam.

Mine got more tangled.
Yes there we go, one is free.
