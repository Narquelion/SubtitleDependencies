The point of this challenge, we have eight ping pong balls.
That are being submerged in the gelli baff,
And then mixed all around.
Five of them are yellow.
If you pick a yellow ping pong ball,
You have to eat a piece of sour candy.
Two of them are pink.
If you pick one of those, you get to eat.
A sweet piece of candy,
And there is one final one, and that is purple.
If you pick a purple one, you get the bag of mystery.
Dun, dun, dun.
We don't know what's gonna be inside the bag of mystery.
Each round, it'll change.
It could be really good, really bad, we have no idea.
So, right now, let's jump into this,
And let's submerge all of the ping pong balls.
Into the jello, or gelli.
What is this void in the oobleck or in the substance.
Alright guys, here we go, round number one,

At the end of this, we are doing a lightning round.
It's gonna be three yellow balls, one red one.
After each round, we're gonna use whatever sour ingredient.
Was used to the bucket of doom.
So, kicking off, we have warheads.
Whoever picks the red one has to eat all of the sour candy,
But right now, we're onto round number two.

Half of the beans are delicious,
Half of them are horrible.

And we're not playing around with beginner ones.
We are only playing around with the black color,
Which is either skunk or black liquorice.
Oh no. - oh my goodness.
Here we go, not excited.
Three, two, one, go for it, and i'll go next.

Or a bad one.

I'm holding onto it.
I've got a good feeling about it.
Three, two, one, open.
