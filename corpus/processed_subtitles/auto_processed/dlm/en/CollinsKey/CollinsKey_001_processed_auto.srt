We're making three different dishes.
The winner gets $10,000.
But, this cook off has a huge twist so let's go.
You challenged us to make a pizza, but here's the twist.
We're not allowed to use a rolling pin,
A pan, a knife, or a can opener.
So, let's go. i've got a whole bunch of.
Dough cause i'm making a - whoa.
Chicago deep dish pizza man. - nice.
I have to cook my eggs but i can't use a hotplate.
Or a pan.
So, i'm using dry ice.
Oh my gosh. that's gonna freeze an egg.
There's no way it's gonna cook the egg though.
I guess we'll find out.
Three, two, one.
Both oh.
Dude, it's sizzling, bro. - whoa, whoa, whoa.
If you do that i'm gonna create.
My chicago deep dish, but the issue is.
I'm not allowed to use a pan. so, i'm just gonna.
Have to kinda - let's just.
Mold it with my hands, - get that out of the way.
Here like this. - this is pretty cool man.
Look at it right there man, just kind of like.
Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh.
Oh, dude. i'm gonna try to cook the egg.
In this thing here.
Yo, it's like bubbling up. - that is so cool.
I gotta say, that's probably the coolest way.
I've ever seen eggs cooked, man.
This reminds me of a stress ball.
The deep dish crust is done.
Next up i gotta make some rotisserie chicken right now.
It totally worked. oh.
Look at this.
Wait, just pick it up is it stuck on there though.
It's a little stuck.
What. - oh my gosh.
Dude. - it looks like a saucer.
And because i'm not allowed to use a knife to slice up the.
Chicken i brought along some.
Wolverine claws, - whoa.
Out of my private collection, so.
Wait a second, what. yup.
Both three, two, one.
Oh. oh.
And don't try this at home.
Yeah, do not try this at home.
Do not. - here we go. let's send.
This off. i didn't know - whoa.
I needed chicken, - woo, iron chef.
But now i do. alright, here we go.
I have a lot of chicken. - oh my gosh.
Kind of blacked out there for a second.
What just happened. - that was crazy.
You got chicken in your hair,
Now look to the side. - do i.
And since i can't use a hot pan or a grill,
Or anything, i gotta use two irons.
Wait for what. - that's right.
I'm cooking the hot dogs just like this.
Oh my- oh geez.
That isn't really cool man. - this is totally working.
You lost a dog.
Next up, time to slice up an onion.
Alright, my hot dogs are cooked.
Alright, well you know,
I think it's time to retire the wolverine claws.
And man, i gotta say these things were a ton of fun.
To cook my steak, i have a brand new way of doing this.
We are using gallium,
Or should i say, liquid metal. - wait.
And i've heated it up - what.
Where the gallium is now molten.
It's extremely hot and we're gonna be pouring it.
On here to see if it sears it, and cooks it.
You're not gonna eat that right.
No, you can not eat it once the gallium has touched it,
We're just doing it to see if it'll actually work.
Do not try this at home.
Put some safety goggles on.
We got a cutting board right here.
We are taking this very.
Seriously. - whoa. gonna get out of the.
Way a little bit.
Both 3, 2, 1,
Ohhhh.
No way.
Listen to that, oh my gosh.
Great job. - yo,
I can smell it sizzling.
It's literally molten metal right now guys.
On the inside of this thing. - eww.
Look at the metal's like still liquid.
And everything dude. - wow.
This is definitely gonna win me the $10,000.
Alright, next up i gotta roll out my dough,
But unfortunately, i can't use a rolling pin,
So i gotta use these things.
Hold on, why do you have blue dough.
Dude, this thing is very difficult.
What is going on.
Alright, here we go, we're just gonna lather.
Some of this cheese on, just like this.
What are you doing.
I'm trying to roll this thing out.
Here we go, i've now lathered up my cheese.
It's time to shave it.
So let's see here, here we go.
Just gonna shave it like this.
This is actually working out.
Ohhh. look at that man.
Cheese shaving out the wazoo bro.
I'm putting the hot dog in the crust,
And now i'm attaching it to the crust.
You're encrusting a hot dog. - yes.
Alright, my crust is done.
And now it's time to cut up some pepperoni.
What are you doing.
I'm brickening my cheese man.
Yeah i can't figure - you're what.

That absolutely is man.
That's like really clean.
I hope you sanitized that brick collins.

In my cooking. - alright, time to.
Cut up this pepperoni.
Wait, how you gonna, again see, how you gonna cut that up.
Without a knife. - oh.
You're probably gonna need to use a brick.
Oh no, no, no.
Uh huh - i got the best way.
Alright collins, i got the saw.
Yo what. you brought a full saw you'd use to.

You challenged us to make a taco,
But we're not allowed to use a tortilla press, a knife,
Or a griddle. so let's go.
Because i'm not allowed to use a griddle,
I'm kicking off by turning my watermelon.
Into a functioning grill right now.
Wow.
And since i can't make a normal tortilla,
I'm making a rice tortilla.
Both oh. - okay, here we go, let's go.
Dude.
It's in my eye, it's in my face.
Alright here we go. - well i'm going to continue.
Over here. - i am drenched off the bat.
Instead of making normal white rice,
I'm making purple rice.
That is brand new bro.
I've never seen a purple rice taco before.
That seems like it's be a lot more convenient, man.
I'm really excited to see if it works.
I'm confused.
Whoa, is this cause you - three, two.
Can't use a knife. - one. oh my gosh, i feel like.
One. oh my gosh, i feel like i'm using a sword right now.
Okay,
I hear it goin' - oh snap.
Both dude.
No. - nice.
But a perfect slice.
Off the top. - good job.
Come at me bro. give me a high five. yeah.
The rice is cooked and it's cooled,
And now it's time to make the patty.
This is called juicing from the bottom.
Careful.
- oh man.
I regret nothing.
Alright well now, i'm taking out my rice from the top.
And i'm gonna lay it down on this very hot skillet thing.
Wait, why. - 'cause this is gonna.
Cook the patty dude.
It's like sizzlin bro,
You're gonna like crisp rice though man.
Exactly.
What. - it ran into my armpit.
Final step is to make the grilling top.
Here on the melon, so we're bringing back the drill, baby.
It totally worked.
Oh my, dude that's super crispy.
Wait, dude what are you drilling on your watermelon.
I'm gonna be grilling a whole bunch of meat for my taco.
I think my purple rice is finally ready.
To be formed into the perfect tortilla shape.
Time to finish up the watermelon grill,
This thing is coming along amazing.
My purple rice taco shell is done,
Now it's time to slice up my pepper.
Wait, so how you gonna slice that without a knife.
Both oh. - liquid nitrogen.
Dude, this is so cool. - i know right.
Oh my gosh. do not try this at home,
We have a trained professional here.
It's time to dunk in my pepper.

And the steam is like all by my legs right now,
It's so cold.
This is insane. - oh my. it's like a hot bath.
Except it's freezing cold. - whoa.
Look at that, it's working.
Dude. this is the most amount of liquid nitrogen.
We've ever had before.
I kinda wanna freeze my pineapple now.
Can i freeze some pineapple.
No, no, no, this is for me collins.
I just wanna freeze some pineapple.
This is for me. you can actually knock on it right now.
I have never heard a pepper that sounds like this before.
Man, this is- - i haven't either.
So cool.
Both whoa.
Oh my gosh. - it's already starting.
To crack,
Alright it's ready to go. - oh my gosh.

For years, man. it's like coming out right now.
Again, do not.
Try this at home. you ready. - yes.
Both three. two. one.
Ohhhhhh.
Oh my gosh. - no way.
And this is all i need, that's perfect.
That sounded like a piece of glass dude.
That is the best alternative to a knife i have ever seen.
Holy cow. - this is insane.
Alright my first ingredient of my salsa is done.
Next ingredient is this mango and a drill.
Wait, you're gonna put a drill in a taco.
No, no, no, i'm drilling the mango.
Why are you drilling the mango, bro.
I gotta drill the mango to get the mango out.
To put it into my salsa.
Now i hit reverse and we reverse outta there.
And look at that. a little bit of mango at a time.
If you can't tell, this is my not impressed face.
Dude, i'm working without a knife.
I'm not impressed. - have you ever tried to make.
Salsa with just a bunch of diced up fruits and vegetables.
Without a knife.
We're not impressed.
Next, i'm gonna pickup some piece of pork right here alright.
Let's just drop 'em in. so here we go, splash.
And now i'm cracking these crab legs.
I put a whole bunch of hot coals.
Inside the watermelon grill,
So hopefully this is gonna work.
And do not try this at home.
Bro, this looks so good.
Three. - both two. one.
Oh.
Dude, listen to it sizzle bro.
Dude. i didn't think this would work man.
A watermelon grill.
Well what might not actually work is cracking these.
With some bolt cutters.
Wait. bolt cutters.
An employee at target told me it was a life-hack.
Alright that's enough pieces of pork for right now.
Perfect, so now i'm gonna let those.
Cook and roast - whoa.
It fits. oh yes.
Oh my gosh.
It actually works man. - dude.
Here, how about this bro, i'll help.

Oh. - it's starting to come along.
Yes. look at that.
Alright here we go, gonna press my tortilla,
Got a tortilla pressing contraption.
Dude, that is way too elaborate.
You can never get too elaborate.
When trying to press a tortilla.
First, i'm gonna put the two pieces of glass together.
Like this, what are you doing.
You got a frog man, - i got a frog.
You're supposed to make music with that.
Separate the two, just like this and then plop it down.
Ooh. yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. yeah.
We have a little pump here,
So this pump is gonna be integral to the plans.
This does not come out dude.
Oh my gosh are you seeing this.
Whoa.
Look at this. - dude.
Why is it not perfectly circular though.
That is amazing.
I'm a little concerned.
Alright man. - nice.
There is my taco shell.
That is the most impressive way.
I have ever seen a tortilla made.
To cook my tortilla,
Since we're not allowed to use a grill, i made a hot rock.
Basically i stuck it in the oven, and got it super hot.
Do not try this at home.
So, let's see if it's actually able to cook my tortilla.
Three.
Both two. one. ohhh.

I gotta pam the rock, hold on.
Alright. here we go. - here we go.

Both three. two. one.
Are you pouring it directly on the fish.
Yeah. - oh my gosh.
Yo. it hardens instantly. keep going, keep going.
Oh my gosh. - this is amazing.
Alright the wax is all hardened.
And now it's time to break out my fish.

I gotta break it open somehow. - yeah how you gonna do this.
I don't know. three, two, one.
Both ohhhhh.
Oh my gosh.
Dude. - it breaks away so easily.
It's working out perfectly.
You gotta be careful,
You're getting wax all on my hot rock bro.
You gotta be gentle with your fish man.
Look it, it cooked all the way through.
This is the final stretch right here.
Oh. oh my gosh.
Whoa. - yo.
That is amazing.
I did not think that would work at all.
Got our tacos and now it's time to assemble them,
But first we gotta add.
Some seasoning to it. - yes.

You get to comment down below - man.
Who's taco do you think is gonna taste better.
We'll be trying them and choosing.
The $10,000 winner at the end of the video.
You challenged us to make a burger.
But we are not allowed to use a knife, a hotplate, or a pan,
So let's go.
To kick mine off i gotta crack some eggs,
And i gotta slice up some tomatoes. three.
Both two. one.
Ohhh.
No way.
What are you making. - i'm making the breading.
For my chicken. next up is for me to slice up this beef,
But i can't use a knife,
So i've got the next best thing, a paper shredder.
Wait, that makes no sense.
That's the office paper - really.
Shredder devan. wait, okay i don't.
Even think it's gonna be able to.
Grind up that meat to be honest bro.
Next up, we gotta melt the cheese,
So we got my moms wax melter over here,
Just gonna place some cheese in.
And i'm sorry mom, from now on whenever you melt wax.
You're gonna smell like a little bit of cheese.
Alright my beef is tenderized.
And collins it's time for you to hold the shredder.
This is raw meat, do not touch raw meat.
And do not try this at home.
Both ready. set. go. oh.
Snap. - dude, it worked.
It does sound kinda broken though.
It's stuck, i want it back, i want my meat back.
Why you can't get it. ah, my cheese fell.
Look, it's starting to overflow on the top devan.
I gotta say, man i did not think that this would work bro,
But i'm actually shocked.
I'm actually kinda surprised this worked too.
If this was featured in an infomercial,
It would be the next billion dollar product for sure.
You ever find yourself at 3 p.m.
Thousands of feet above the earth in a goodyear blimp.
With nothing but raw meat and a paper shredder.
No. - but if you did,
What would you wanna do with it devan.
You got raw meat, - beef basher.
No that's not the design yet.
You got raw meat and you got a - beef basher.
Devan, you've got raw meat and a paper shredder.
Beef basher 2000.
There we go. ours.
Order today by calling my personal cellphone number 555.

We're on air.
Got my garlic minced up,
I think i'm gonna make some aioli.
And i'm gonna use this mustard next.
As you make your aioli,

Alright here we go, so let's see if i can.
Suck up some of this cheese,
Three. two. one.

Oh my gosh. i'm gonna go on the side like this,
Here we go, three, two, one,
Just gonna inject the cheeese - what are you-.
Both oh. - it's dripping out the sides.
Oh boy. okay.
Time to mix my stuff up. next up gotta cook my shrimp.
We don't have a hot plate though,
How you gonna cook that thing dude.
I'm gonna use an electric fly swatter.
What if it like combusts the shrimp.
I guess we'll find out - it's an electric.
Fly swatter, bro. if it touches it might just go, boof.
Both ohhh.
That was definitely a piece of shrimp.
Alright, here we go, three.
Oh my gosh. oh boy. - two. one.
Both ohhhh.
Ohhhhhh.
I did not think that would work bro.
I didn't either. - next up i gotta chop my.
Onions, but since i have no knife,
I'm gonna use a figure skate.
A what. how are you gonna slice it.
It doesn't seem that sharp man.
Three. two. one.
Oh yeah. - oh my gosh.
If you do that, here we go.
I'm gonna pop my potato on the top here like this.
Got in my eye.
You shoot onion juice in your eye man.
- are you alright.
So how bout this, i'm just gonna borrow.
Your skate real quick.
This was a much better method so here we go.
Just gonna slice up like this,
Give us a second, we gotta finish this up real quick.
Dude, this no knife thing is so tough,
I'm gonna have to use pencil sharpeners to cut my onion.
I'm having an issue with no hot plate,
But i think i've got a great solution,
A curling iron to cook my bacon.
And remember, do not try this at home.
Oh. you hear the sizzle. this works.
Oh my gosh just gonna take it off,
And just gonna place it down here, you ready.
Both three. two. one.
Oh, gonna curl up a few more of those.
And then it's time to assemble the burger.
Time to dredge my chicken. - dredge it.
So, i'm just gonna dip it in here first.
That's called dredging.
And then they go right in to here.
Wait, ew my gosh .
What do you mean, "ew my gosh".
This is gonna be amazing.
I don't know man, it's kinda questionable.
Alright this is my last piece of chicken.
I've got my cheese-filled burger patties,
And now it's time to cook these in a very unique way.
You ready devan. - i'm so ready.
I'm sure this is gonna blow your minds,
So right now let's hop outside.
We have a lamborghini here,
Which was lent to us by our friend chris.
We're gonna be cooking the meat in two different ways.
Number one, is on the engine.
And number two is on the tailpipes.
Here we go. three. two. one. - oh man.
Dude.
Oh my gosh. - what.
I've got the burger meat and now it's time.
To see if it will actually cook. do not try this at home.
So here we go, lemme get 'em in position.
Both three. two. one.
Oh.
Oh my gosh. dude. it is so hot right now,
I can feel the heat coming off.
Alright that's enough right now for the burgers, devan.
So, next up we're gonna see.
The tailpipe can cook your chicken.
Alright. three. two. one.
Dude. what.
This is insane.
Done. alright.
Alright. my chicken's looking super crispy dude.
And the burgers are almost done,
So we're just gonna be cookin 'em a little bit more.
And then we'll be adding these to our burgers.
Now surprisingly, this didn't work,
So we actually had to put it in the oven.
It's now time to assemble the burgers,
So i gotta say, off the bat bro,
My bun - what.
Turned out so good.
Mine looks so boring in comparison.
It truly is,
I really hope these unconventional cooking techniques work.
'cause i wanna win the $10,000 so bad man.
Dude, same.
For my burger patty,
Remember this thing is filled with cheese.
Yo, dude yours actually turned out really good.
Next up, we're gonna get some pickles on there,
'cause you gotta get some salty, crispy, crunchiness on it,
Then of course we've got the spirally bacon.
Time to put the finishing touches on out burger.
And i'm really excited to see who's looks better,
But more importantly, who's tastes better.
So right now let's finish these things up.
We've got the burgers.
And i say mine is definitely worth the $10,000.
I don't know man, i think mine is.
So here's the big reveal.
Both three. two. oh wait.
If you wanna win a 15 minute video call with devan and i,
Text the word "eat" to 81800 right now,
So pause the video, text the word "eat" to 81800,

You get to comment down below,
Who's burger do you think is gonna taste better,
We'll be tasting them,
And choosing the $10,000 winner at the end of the video.

Just a forkful.
Yes, what are you doing here.
I'm just trying to turn it around.

I got mine perfectly clean, devan.
You're being judged on this man.
This is a little bit more difficult than i expected.
A dry ice egg man, you put an egg on a pizza once before.
Which i questioned but it actually tased really good,
But a dry ice egg.
It looks like it turned out though didn't it.
It has a weird like texture and quality to it,
I can't quite put my finger on it,
But it's not quite the most appetizing look.
I don't know if you're looking at the.
Same thing i'm looking at.
Oh, i definitely am man.
Here's the first slice. collins you can have the honors.
Oh, see you missed the egg.
Your blue crust is um-.
Is what. fantastic. amazing. like the ocean.
Reminds you of everything good in the world.
Suspicious.
Here you go collins.
Yep, be very careful.
Here is your, yep, there ya go.
Time for my slice.
Wait, why do you get a bigger slice than.
I do man. - i did.
If you look at the exact, okay they're the same.
I tried to make it pretty equal.

I did a good job on this.
Both three. two. one.

It's so bad it makes you wanna do kung fu.
Wow. hat's like a weird combo man.

A lamborghini, so it might - i know.
Change the whole taste of 'em.
The chicken was right by the tailpipes man,
Just taking a whole bunch of heat from the car.
Alright i think i'm gonna cut it in half first.
With a fork and,
I've never seen someone just cut a burger just.
Alright here we go, going down the center.
Dude, the shrimp, i forgot, with the electric fly swatter.
Man, just zappin it, i don't know if it cooked it or not.
Yeah - oh, there goes a shrimp,
You lost one. - this is a tough one man.

Three, two,
Hold up, what are you three, two, one-ing.
I'm revealing your burger.
You have a lot of full onions in here, man.
Yeah, it was more for aesthetics.
Oh my gosh, it's all sliding apart devan.
I gotta say in terms of construction,
This burger gets a b minus.
Can i order this burger without onions.
Can i just take the onions off please.
I'm the chef and i think you should eat it.
The way the chef prepared.
Here we go.
What are you doing.
I'm not taking off the onions, it just fell off.
Uh-huh, really.
Yeah - on purpose.
Oh wait, now i lost the bottom bun, hold on devan.
Really. you're so much drama man. just eat it.
Both three. two. one.
Once you get all the flavors, it's not so bad.
It made me do a little "hmm".
Yeah, i like that.
Got some cheese, you know, got some burger.
I gotta say that was really good,
Once you get past the initial onion man,
It was delicious - yeah. that was actually,
Really, really good. - here we go.
Time to slice down from the top man,
But do not try this at home.
Oh man, the cheese.
Three,
Both two, one.
Ohhhh.
Look at the cheese.
Whoa.
Bro, it's all wet and slimy.
I'm just doing my best to make a great burger, man.
Right now let's see how this cheese-filled,
Lamborghini-grilled burger tastes. three.
Both two. one.

The pickles taste really good.
You get to comment down below.

We've got the completed tacos,
And now it's time to find out which one is worthy of $10,000.
And just remember,
We grilled the meat on a watermelon,
So it might change the whole flavor.
Of this thing - oh, yeah.
This thing's in a taco bowl that was made by a hot rock.
Alright i don't know how we do this, do we just,
I've never eaten a taco bowl whole before.
I'll grab my fork and knife.
Oh, yeah you wanna split it in half.
You did do a good job of cutting these things man.
Thank you, wait cutting what.
Of cutting these.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. that's right, thank you.
My art on the side is definitely.
You're opening this thing up and not in the best way, man.
It started off as a taco bowl,
And it's turned into a regular taco.
Alright so i guess on the count of three.
We'll see how this thing tastes, you ready. three.
Both two. one.
Oh yeah.
You know what, i didn't think the flavors blended,
But they really do.
I think that watermelon actually really helped.
With the fruity flavor.
Yours is gonna have a tall mountain to climb.
If it looks to beat this one here.
Yeah, the pomegranate seeds.
Like tied the whole dish together.
So now devan, time to find out how yours tastes.
Yeah, mines got a rice taco shell,
Prepared in a coffeemaker.
That's not even the craziest thing bro,
You have fish that's been cooked in hot wax.
I think this is gonna taste great.

You get to comment down below, who's taco won this round.
Now it's time to find out who won the $10,000.
There were three different dishes,
And i gotta say devan, you definitely won the burger dish.
Oh yeah, definitely.
That was all yours, but the taco dish,
That was mine right there - yes, unfortunately.
And what it all comes down to is the pizza dish,
So mine, i gotta say, a lot of really unique flavors,
But all-in-all it had multiple different layers.
Of all it's goodness within - yeah, but presentation.
Was super weak.
Okay yeah, i gotta say the blue crust.
Was definitely a nice touch on yours, egg in the middle.
Yeah, mine looked the part.
It looked like $10,000.
But ultimately it comes down to taste, devan.
Yeah.
And if we're jusdging based on taste,
I think you know the answer.
Unfortunately, i don't think mine was the greatest.
Therefore - so i think, you won.
Yes. i won the $10,000. - nicely done.
