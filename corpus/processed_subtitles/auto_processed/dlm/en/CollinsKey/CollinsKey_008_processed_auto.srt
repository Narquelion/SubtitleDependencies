You challenged us to pull the most insane diy pranks.
Of all time on our unsuspecting friends.
Oh my god.
That's prank number one.
Holy cow.
Alright, our friends are arriving right now.
And they think they're just coming over.
For a normal house tour,
But really it's going to be a nonstop prank war.
And the first prank is with the front door.
We call it the boom stick. enjoy.
Yeah, come on in.
Before all the chaos begins, it is time to teach.
You how to make these super crazy diy pranks,
But let's rewind it before our friends got here.
It is one hour before our friends get here,
So it's time to setup all the pranks.
The first one is.
The boom stick right here. - boom.
We're going to be putting it on the front door.
To really start off the tour with a bang.
The first prank we are working on is.
The mannequin jump scare prank.
So basically a friend of ours is gonna get.
In a zombie costume, stand super still,
And at the right moment jump out.
Was that a good reaction.
No, that wasn't good at all.
That was a nice little run. - it was a little extra.
So we're also going to have an edible brain.
Some snakes kinda scattered around our friend.
In the zombie costume.
I'm making the edible brain.
And i'm making the snakes.
But right now i'm going to add in some pecans over here,
Like this.
I've got my string here,
And this is outlining where the snakes are gonna go.
And this is the, the.
Gotta be careful where you point that thing.
This is for gaps and cracks.
Next thing i need for the edible brain.
There's a whole bunch of peanut butter here.
So devan you've got some gloves on.
Can you open that for me.
I do, i will help.
Also, i forgot to mention - dude.
We're going to be pranking each other.
As we go through this.
Yeah.
Definitely found my first prank.
All right.
The war is on bro. - it is on.
So here we go, i got some real peanut butter over here.
So, just gonna add this in.
Jeez dude.
So here it goes,
Squeeze it in.
Squeeze.
We got the ambiguous chihuahua cat-dog.
Still can't tell whether or not it's a cat or a dog.
Hoooo.
Powdered sugar.
We're gonna add this in right now.
So there we go, okay boom.
Smack that.
Sorry.
Was that a prank too, man.
I don't know, i meant to smack it but.
I forgot it was in a hinge and its flung.
Devan oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Collins oh, man.
Devan so i'm gonna coil it around the string here.
I gotta say man, you do not have a steady hand.
But me.
Yeah, i gotta steady hand.
Collins all right, well here we are,
We're gonna get in here and just kinda,
Mix all this up.
So, the shape of the snake is done.
Now, i just have to clear this away,
And make the skin of the snake.
Collins dude, i nailed it.
Devan wow. - collins that's the perfect like,
Play dough consistency.
I gotta get the brain mold.
Oh wait. - where you going.
We're both leaving.
No, no, no, no, no.
Gimme the brain.
Goodbye.
Right there. all right, now that devan's gone,
I've got some extra pranks for him,
So  don't say anything.
Devan are you talking to me, collins.
Nope, no you're good devan.
Devan i got the clay.
Wait, from upstair- wait, wait,
You just left to the, what.
I'm super confused.
Aye. my brain mold.
Whoa, what, what, what do you mean.
Collins it's clear, it's a clear brain mold.
I can see it.
So here we go, just gonna plop and drop.
Devan plop and drop.
Collins bam. gonna add in a little bit more.
Peanut butter. but, time to pop this thing in the fridge.
I'm gonna add a beautiful glaze.
I'm gonna start rolling out this clay here.
What're doing dude.
Just leave dude.
What's your issue. you got problems leaving bro.
All right, now that collins is gone.
I'm actually gonna prank him with this rubber brick.
Whoa. dude, what. - collins i'm back.
I'm back.
How did you get there.
I'm a ninja.
And you heard nothing, right.
Yeah, yeah, no what's up.
I just got a brick here.
That actually hurt. what was the prank.
It's a rubber brick.
Okay, so it hurt less than a real brick.
But you still smacked me.
All right, just gotta roll this stuff out.
Yup, and for this time,
I'm for real gonna go grab my brain out of the fridge.
All right, so my brain is all frozen down. - oh.
I have a serious brain freeze right now.
As you can tell.
It's got very cold.
Oh yeah,
Whoa. wow.
Here we're going to take our frozen brain,
Plop and drop. and then we're gonna start to make a-.
A lot more drop.
Here we go, this is-.
Well, before you do that, i have the clay rolled out.
And i'm gonna add the scales with this mesh stuff here.
Actually, can you hand me that pan down over there, devan.
Oh yeah, sure. -that would be perfect.
So here we go, pick up my brain,
Pop the brain in the pan like that. - here you go.
What are you up to.

That was a last minute change.
Collins ready, three,

As you can tell.
Yes. - we got the camera too, if you guys wanna wave.

Wait, collins, i forgot to clean out the boxes.
Yep, let's get those out of here, all right. - let me just.
Grab these.
So, the next thing that we're going to be doing.
Is that we're going to be hopping into.
I forgot about that one.
No more surprises, ah. - no more surprises going on.
Yeah, right.
It's a prank house tour, so da da.
All right, we got a couple rooms we're.
Going into for this prank tour right now.
All right guys, follow me into the kitchen.
Devan oh. looks like he found my bonus prank.
Let's go back to before our friends arrived to show you.
How to make the next set of pranks.
Next up in the kitchen,
We are doing the prank food roulette challenge. - yup.
So basically, we've got twelve different foods.
And half of them are normal delicious foods.
No whoa. what. - the other half of them.
Are prank foods.
Are you kidding me.
And are guests have no idea which are which.
And here's the twist, they get to choose what they eat.
And what we eat. so they'll be getting pranked,
We'll be getting pranked. there's gonna be lots of pranks.
Get out of here with these pranks.
That actually kinda hurts a little bit.
All right, so right now let's make some prank food.
Hiya. - no.
So, for my first prank,
I'm making lil' debbie birthday cakes.
Lil' debbie birthday cakes.
How can you make little debbie birthday cakes without me.
Little debbie.
You're definitely not little debbie.
What talking about man. totally lil'.
Full on deb.
Devan there's just no way man. - i'm debra.
Collins, what is this.
I don't think you should look at that.
Are you trying to prank me here.
Don't pay attention to the tape.
It has nothing to do with anything.
See, i would grab a new package,
But this is the only one we have and i need this.
Mhm, yes. that's, yes. look, aw wait, wait, wait.
What're you doing. what're you. what're you.
Pick that up. pick it up real quick. - fine, fine.
Cool, all righst so we're good here.
What did you do.
Totally nothing at all. - really.
I'm glad we have your only box.
Of lil' debbie birthday cakes.
They're over there. we have more boxes.
All right, while you do that, i'm gonna add in some.
Sriracha into my agar agar over here.
Whoa. okay, wait. no, there's nothing in here.
Might've been one of these. i might've mixed it up.
We'll save it for when our friends.
Get here later and then prank. - deet.
What's that. - it's a lil' deet.
All right, so add in the sriracha sauce into the.
Agar agar and now it's time to mix it all up.
So, gotta boil this, cook it up right now, and then.
Make the little sriracha balls.
Devan wait, aren't sponges normally wet when they.
Come out of the packaging man.
What. they're all this way.
Its been a while since i've- no. these are mine.
Three, two, one.
Both whoa.
We made it back, oh, we're crossing.
Devan i just got to cut these sponges.
In the shape of the little debbie birthday cakes.
All right, well, i've got this jar right here.
So, now its time to strain out the sriracha caviar.
So, we have some cold vegetable oil over here.
Stand right there. its cold.
Ah. - ha ha, pranked.
There we go, there we go. - my number one pet peeve.
Is oily fingers so, yeah.
Oh.
Gonna suck up some little sriracha goblets.
Droplets, what.
Gotta figure out how many little debbie birthday cakes.
Come in one package, so i can make that amount.
Can you please say that, like a tiny-.
Lil' debbie birthday cakes.
Cause' it's not like birthday, its like bird day.
Collins now it's time to harvest my sriracha caviar,
So here we go.
Wait, harvest it. what the- - yup, i gotta-.
What.
Collins well it's in there you gotta get it out.
That's not gonna fit, okay.
Collins all right, let's see if we can just,
Scoop down into it. oh. there we go. boom. look at that.
Devan and it looks so convincing.
Collins yo. this is baller.
Devan so, i'm actually putting edible frosting.
On the inside of these sponges.
Next prank is silly string in the fridge.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. - oh sorry.
That was pointed the wrong way. - what was that.
Or was it a prank.
Got you bro. - no, no why.
So basically, i'm going to be putting these.
Silly string things in the fridge. so that way when our.
Guests open up the fridge, gonna blast em'.
Where are you gonna put them in the- agh.
Sorry.
Where are you gonna put them in the fridge dude.
Oh well, see that's the thing is that i'll-.
I'll take it out, i'll take it out, i'll take it out.
Let's see, i don't know,
Maybe top shelf would be good or something-.
Devan yes. - oh my gosh.
Two snakes. - yes dude.
Was that necessary, devan. - oh yeah.
One wouldn't do the job. - nope.
Devan i got some white chocolate here.
That i'm dipping these lil' debbie birthday cakes into.
Bird day cakes.
So, to make this silly string prank,
What i'm basically gonna do is take a thumbtack.
And stick it right in the hole that the silly string.
Comes out of.
I don't know the technical term for it.
Press it down like, there we go, okay, and then here we go,
Tape it on the sides like this.
All right, next up it is time for the.
Mayonnaise and ice cream prank so basically-.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's in your pocket. dude.
It's on fire, it's on fire.
Oh my gosh. dude, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Ooooh. - you put something in the lemon bag.
It's a prank.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, you put a smoker in the lemon bag.
I did. this is a bigger prank as well,
That involves our oven.
Wait, we're pranking our oven now.
How is mom gonna make her delicious banana bread.
If we're pranking the oven.
Are you kidding. we have multiple ovens.
You got, one, two, three, four ovens.
That's an impressive quantity of ovens.
Next up is the ice cream and mayonnaise prank.
Basically, you replace a whole mayonnaise jar.
With delicious ice cream.
Nice, wait dude, i wanna try this thing. - mmm.
Mm hmm - hold up.
Wahoo.  - whoa. what was that.
That's the real stuff. - no.
Pranked.
Raugh.
My prank is-.
Ha. - excuse me.
That was a prank. ha ha, gotcha.
I'm using this fog machine, putting it in the oven.
So, you'll see. i got one of the trays locked in here man.
Maybe, we turn the oven on. - no. no, n-.
You actually press the button.
First tray is out man.
I thought they were racks.
Devan next up, i'm taking this big speaker here.
Holy cow. - and i'm puttin' this in the oven as well.
Feel like a block party with that thing. -yes.
Are we gonna have like a- is this like a-.
You'll see, you'll see. -oh.
Is it like a broken oven prank.
It's gonna scare me. - no dude, it's not that scary.
Oh my gosh. holy cow.
For my next food prank, i'm making garlic almond joy's.
All right, well, i'm gonna keep filling up.
The mayonnaise in here.
All right, next thing i'm gonna have to do is freeze.
This whole container righ-.
Garlic.  - what.
Ha. it's like a movie man. your like, what.
What.
All right, collins take a whiff.
No, no, no, no. all right, here we go,
Gonna pop this in the freezer right now.
Collins all right, while he's doing that i think that.
My ice cream is finally frozen so, here we go,
Gonna pull it out. ta da.
Wow. whoa. no way. - that looks just like ice cream bro.
Wanna take a taste of it real quick. - no.
Cause' you know what the real stuff tastes like.
Ah no. - all right, so i'm gonna pull this mold off and.
Ta da. oh, oh. i'm gonna top it off, instead of an almond,
Use garlic cloves.
My eyes are watering and that's not even an onion.
But i do have some onions, just wait.
Oh god. i'm out, i'm out.  i quit.
Come back.
All right, the last thing i gotta do for my garlic joy.
Is add some chocolate on the top.
I've got some chicken gravy over here.
Which i'm playing with off as butterscotch gravy, but.
Its actually made out of chicken.
Ugh. - collins here we got some crisco.
It's like melting it. - yeah it's kinda coagulating.
Here we go, we use this crisco as kinda like the.
Whipped cream on the top. i'm gonna have to clean it up.
A little bit but i think this is a pretty.
Convincing ice cream dessert. - yeah.
So i'm gonna pop this in the fridge.
This next one is a very tricky one.
And we'll definitely get our unsuspecting guests.
Yeah very tricky. why'd you drop all my pickles over here.
All right, cool, pickles are fully washed so-.
Wait a second, isn't a pickled cucumber just a pickle.
Yeah but i'm going for the gusto on the name.
Begin crying in three, two, one, yeah.
Oh my gosh. my pickles.
I don't know. if your gonna cry over something,
Mind as well crying over your pickles.
All right so, here we go, got a pickle on a stick.
Hohoo. that's cool.
Oooooo. - it's very, very satisfying.
Now i just gotta stick it in the caramel.
And we have a fake caramel apple.
All right, well, it's. done.
Ha, it is.
It is.
We're just gonna have to hope that it passes as a banana.
It's definitely not a banana.
All right, so i've added some sprinkles but.
To add some more i need this egg.
That doesn't make any sense - what do you mean.
How's an egg gonna add sprinkles - i'm gonna use this egg.
To crack it on head. - you're gonna- no, no, no, no, no.
No. no, no, no, no. devan, devan. - oh. look at that.
What. what on earth. - i'm adding the sprinkles.
What did you think was gonna happen.
You have an egg, what did you think, i think would happen.
You're crazy, dude. and i think i actually.
Need some more sprinkles, so i got another egg right here.
You ready. - yup, yeah, go for it.
Oh. - that was a real one. that was a real one.
All right, well now it's time to set everything up.
And get this room ready for our friends.
We got fridge pranks, oven pranks,
And a whole bunch of real fake foods.
So, right now let's get it all ready.

That's gonna last for about a week.
I want another oreo.
Collins so, ava, next up we have your birthday cake.
All right, well, i picked something packaged because.
I thought that maybe a good idea.
But now, my confidence is taken.
Collins wait did you take another bite of the cucumber.

Being all sneaky over there.
Devan are you- wow. - what is wrong with you.
All right ava, we believe in you,
Just go for it, take a big bite, go for it.
Is it workin'.
Devan oh, what do you taste.
It's a sponge. - it's a sponge.
That's not even food.
I just, like, pushed chocolate up into my gums.
She's like what is this substance.
Collins okay so now it's time for my final prank food.
These lil' cake pops. - devan yup.
I'm looking at devan, i'm trying to like sus' him out,
Like he might've added this in like.
An extra little prank one.
Who knows man, who knows.
Everyone three, two, one.
Devan whoa. that was all of it.
Oh yeah.
Dude, i can't believe you got the normal one.
Hey man, in my defense, they choose the foods i got to eat.
So, not my fault.
That makes it even worse.
All right, so those are the prank food roulette's.
But we still have one more prank room,
With a crazy big prank that we're gonna end it all with.
Gonna hop out right now. yeah, let's do it.
So over here, this is the last area we're going to be doing.
Pranks, but there's a twist for this one.
Instead, us pulling pranks on you guys,
You guys actually get to pull a prank on us.
Yes, finally. - collins yes, exactly.
Okay so, here's the only twist though,
You gotta open up the trash can.
Oh come on.
So trust me, no more pranks, just a trash can.
Nothing suspicious.
What could go wrong, it's just a trash can.
Do it.
Yeah, if you guys wanna get closer to the trash can.
Yeah, yeah, just get a lot- yeah.
Just ah, we're just gonna chill back here.
If you just wanna just- - devan tell us what's inside.
Collins yeah, yeah, yeah,
Just tell us what's inside the trash can.
There's nothing in it.
Time for us to make our final diy prank and.
This is the ultimate slime dump.
I'm making a jiggly water slime.
Devan and i'm making a fanta slime.
Collins we're just gonna add some food coloring.
Like that, yo. dude, the little like droplets kinda like,
Skidded out on all of it bro.
All right, time to mix in the coloring.
So, here we go, just gonna go, ooh. dude.
Its little like cyclone.
And i added all the glue so now i'm adding the activator.
Your moving along quickly.
I sure am. its almost like i've made slime before.
If you could just leave it like that, that would be awesome.
Oh, like an ombre effect.
Yeah, exac- what. i don't know.
Its got a little marbling in there too.
Oooo, look at all these art words.
All right, so next up to make my slime,
I gotta add some activator. oop. i almost spilled it all.
Here's the activator for you, yes.
Awesome man. so, here we go-.
Whoa. - what. come on. - yes.
How many of these things have we hidden around the house.
A lot.
This has become the staple prank of this video, man.
Like snack attack. they're everywhere.
I don't wanna open that one.
Why it's just activator. - are you kidding me.
W-why. why would i possibly not wanna open that one.
I have no idea. forget it dog.
It's for you.
Unfortunately, to make my slime i need activator.
Both three, two, one.
Oh. what. - oh aye, okay.
There you go.
High five.
There we go, whoa. - oh whoa.
