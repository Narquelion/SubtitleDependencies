Here we go, .
What's up, it's collins key,
And welcome to the thursday vlog.
Now for today's video, i'm definitely stepping.
Outside my comfort zone, just kinda going for it,
And today i'm going to be tasting mexican candy,
And this is something that a lot of you guys.
Have been asking me to do.
I just got in my shipment of all.
My mexican candy that i ordered.
Oh my gosh, this is heavy.
So yeah, there's a lot of different,
Crazy looking candies in here, like all this stuff.

Without any further ado, i say we jump right in.
To the taste testing mexican candies video.
Seamless.
All right to kick it off, i'm going to be starting.
With this one right here, and to be honest with you guys,
It kind of looks like poop on a spoon,
So hopefully it tastes better than poop on a spoon.
All right, so right off the bat these spoons.
Oh well,  they're looking rather sketchy.
'cause they've got like this plastic bag on them.
With a little rubber band, and then it's just stuff.
On a plastic spoon, so this is looking.
Rather  right now.
Okay, all right guys, so cheers, let's see how this goes.
Hmm.
It started off kinda good,
And then , i don't know what happened.
Overall, it's not bad, but it's not.
It's not a favorite of mine, that's for sure,
So let's whoo , there's some serious.
Aftertaste in this one.
Next up is something called slaps.
So basically it's just like a lollipop.
It like a leaf.
It looks like a leaf lollipop.
Now it is called a slap, so i guess i have.
To try it out, so let's see here.
Ow.
I don't know how to do this .
Ho, wow, this is really crazy.
I don't know how to eat this.
I don't know, ah, oh.
They're actually not bad.
They're kinda like green apple flavor.
I guess you could say, but these are actually pretty good.
All right for this next one, i'm a little bit concerned.
Don't even wanna comment  on what this looks like,
But we're gonna open it up.
This thing appears to be a pump,
So i don't know if you're supposed to pump it.
All in your mouth all at once, but we're gonna go for it.
What on earth is this stuff.
It's like spicy hmmm.
It's got like this really bizarre aftertaste to it as well.
So i really want to get that taste.
Out of my mouth right now, so i'm going to try.
These things right here, which they're green,
And they look colorful, and there's a dude on them waving.
Do you push like this.
I think you have to take this off.
How do you get this off.
There we go, all right.
Hmm, so apparently if you push down like this,
It's  what.
Let's see .
All right, so let's see here.
On my gosh, look at this, it's just undulating out of it.
So you know the stuff that i tried before,
Like the spoon stuff here.
It seems like it's the exact same stuff.
Not a big fan overall of the taste of this stuff,
But overall it gets style points for just.
How fun it is to get out so whoo.
So this little thing here, there's like.
A lemon dude on the outside, he's like this big,
Muscular guy going like this.
And then do you dump it in your mouth.
I don't know.
We'll give it a shot.
It's look like for real in an emergency right now.
Woo hoo, it's like salt.
It's like literally salt.
Everything about me feels dry right now .
It's like i bit into 12 lemons at once.
Next up is something called tama roca.
Let's see, ooh wow.
These are like massive lollipops it appears.
That's kind of interesting.
I'm gonna take a nibble of it first to give it a shot.
That's weird, it's chewy.
Yeah, you gotta take a bite out of it,
So i like this one though.
This one's tasty, so this one gets a thumbs up.
I like it.
So next up is this little one right here,
And if you guys can see,
It looks like a little pudding almost.
Let's give this a shot.
Hmmm,  i like this one a lot.
Next up, i'm taking a big chance,
And i'm going with another pump looking thing ,
And hopefully this tastes different.
It's got a little squirt nozzle thing on it,
So let's give this a shot, let's see.
Oh my god, .
Hmm, uh uh .
This is just like the spicier, more potent.
Version of this stuff.
So i think as a general rule of thumb,
Anything that has a pump form on it,
Not for collins, not for collins .
And now for the biggest bag of them all.
Which basically just contains a whole bunch of little ones.
In there but shh, no one has to know.
This is another push contraption, and it looks like.
It's made out of the same turd looking fruit,
So it seems to be very popular, that turd looking fruit.
It just tastes kinda crazy, kinda like a turd a little bit.
Let's see, okay here we go.
Ooh, yeah, no, no, hmm uh, huh uh.
Don't, don't like it.
I've saved the best for last, or in this case.
I think the most interesting for last.
It's called salsaghetti, and this appears.
To be a spaghetti candy.
You've got the spaghetti noodles right here,
And then you have the sauce, and this sauce,
And even on the packaging they have the sauce.
Coming out of one of the those pump contraptions.
That i love so very dearly.
So let's give the salsaghetti a shot.
We're gonna put the sauce on right now.
Hmm, looks delicious.
And i'm not really good when it comes to moderation,
So instead of taking one noodle at a time,
Let's just go all the way,
We're going for all of them at once.
Here we go.
Okay,
The noodles themselves.
Okay, ugh, whoa.
Okay , so the noodles themselves are not bad.
The sauce it just adds that extra hmmm,
It's just like so powerful.
It's very spicy, but ow , why did i do that.
Forgot it was on my thumb, it's more of the sauce.
My eyes are starting to water,
But yeah, that's it for this week's video.
