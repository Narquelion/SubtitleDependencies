I was up all night thinking about it.
And i've been so fixated on who i want to be.
And where i want to be,
I haven't thought about who i am.
It's like you and carlie have been saying,
I need to just go out there and figure it out--.
Okay, where are we.
Where are we going.
Okay, because the car's a half mile back.
And we gotta bounce if we're gonna make my sister's show.
Dude, chill, we'll make it, okay.
But it's like, it's like a magic trick,
A magic trick, 'cause with a magic trick,
It's about the moments you know.
It's not about the card tricks.
The card tricks don't mean anything,
It's the moment, the experiences, you know.
And it's like what you've been saying, this girl,
She's everything that's been missing in my life.
We gotta go, alright.
The fence says that there's an art show.
In downtown this,
Yeah, yeah, this is the right place, right place.
Collins, just get the video message.
So we can get outta here.
No she's gotta be in here.
Collins.
You promised, okay.
So we have to go.
You have to be there.
No, what i have to do.
Is stop listening to what everyone says i have to do.
All the time.
This is so important to me jacob.
And i think, i think that i'm in love with this girl.
You don't even know what love is.
You haven't even kissed anyone yet.
I didn't, i didn't mean it like that, okay.
Just, five minutes, okay.
