What's up, guys.
It's collins key,
And welcome to the thursday vlog.
Now, for today's video,
I've got a brand new challenge for you,
And i need someone to help me out with this.
You haven't seen him in quite a while,
So everyone please welcome back to the thursday vlog,
The mini-fridge version of me, devan key.
Hey.
Catch the egg.
Oh.
That was close.
For today's video,
We are going to be combining two things.
One thing you don't know about us is.
The fact that we can both juggle.
We have juggling skills,
Off the skillet, yo.
I don't know what i was doing there.
Off the skillet.
What.
And the second thing is.
You guys love watching us get destroyed by eggs,
.
The juggling and also the egg-destroying.
There's three super difficult rounds to this.
Whoever wins the majority of these difficult rounds,
They get to destroy the other person.
With a full carton of eggs.
Whoa.
So basically,
If you guys are ready for this video,
Make sure you guys give it a thumbs up right now.
Without any further ado, devan, catch the egg.
No.
Dude.
You ready.
I wasn't ready.
Catch it, catch it, catch it.
Yay, alright, let's do this.
Round one, the classic juggle-off.
Whoever can juggle for the longest wins.
Here we go.
One, two, three, go.
Dude.
Nervewracking.
You can't hit my hands, bro. that's cheating.
Ah. so nervous.
Oh, dude. you can't do that.
Well, i lost first.
I lasted like one second longer than you did, so.
Alright.
Yeah, you did, by one second.
So, i lose that round.
Round two, not my arms.
Yay.
They're not really my arms.
Whoever gets the most tosses.
Without dropping wins this round.
And, begin.
One, two, three, four. oh. dude.
Hey, what's up. hey, hey.
Dude.
That was so-- dude, seriously.
Oh. what.
You can't do-- you can't do that to me, bro.

There we go. that's what you get.
I kinda-- oh.
Round 3. ah.
Dude, chill. chill.
Oh, no.
It's going into my ear hole.
Round three is called stealing.
You'll see why in a second.
Without further ado, let's get started.
And begin.
Oh, snap. oh, he's thinkin' about it.
Uh oh. uh oh. oh. oh. see, this is actually-- bro.
Devan wins this challenge.
He gets to destroy me with a full carton of eggs.
I'm so psyched.
Oh, no. i can do whatever i want.
Alright, cool.
Let's do it.

For, like, some encouragement,
'cause i'm not looking forward to this.
