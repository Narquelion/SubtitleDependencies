So are we like, sure this is the right place.
I think so, 'cause like basically.
Everyone figured out that, in the first keyhole.
You could see these different wrestling ropes.
And then from there, there was a.
Profile tag that brought them to.
Another profile, and then that one.
Was a whole bunch of different luchador masks.
And then from that profile there.
Was another hidden tag, and then.
It brought them to this pic right here.
Basically, it's a lucha libre fight in boyle heights.
It's okay, i'll protect you.
Just in case anything happens, this.
Is my location, avenge my death.
You'll be fine.
That's a good one.
It's after five collins, boundaries, remember.
No, i don't know, no i should.
No, you shouldn't.
No we should walk.
Thank you.
Bye.
Door number one, i think that's an instagram account.
It smells like pee.
You guys, it's a video.
She's probably in here, come on.
I don't think, okay dude.
Come on she's probably in here, come on.
Alright, jacob, don't leave me, come on.
Is this what you had in mind.
Mystery girl i used to fight with myself.
Do this, say that, be this person, not that one.
I was putting on a show, a spectacle.
Fighting to hide who i really was.
But, in a fight, someone has to lose.
And when you're fighting yourself, it's always gonna be you.
So i stopped fighting and started living.
You should too, come find me.
You're getting closer.
What is he saying.
Light version, i don't think he likes you on your phone.
I'm sorry, wait, wait, wait, check this out.
Oh my god, let's leave.
What happened.
I just hit on a wrestler in front of his wife.
Collins oh my gosh.
If you guys need me, i will be in the bathroom,
Drowning myself in the toilet, okay.
Carla okay.
So, please, move.
Should we go now.
No, let's give him a minute.
Alright.
In the meantime, may i have this dance.
