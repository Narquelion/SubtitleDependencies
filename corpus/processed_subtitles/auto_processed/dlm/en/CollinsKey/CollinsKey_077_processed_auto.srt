Flour drop.
Oh, man.
Oh my gosh.
Oh wow.
Yo, we are.
Collins what did you do.
You challenged us to make the largest.
Bowl of pasta ever, so let's go.
Now it's time for me to make my ravioli noodles.
And i'm making my red sauce.
Dude, my cheese is so.
Can you please get this off, devan. this is mine.
Oh, that's all yours.
I see how it is.
Collins it's for the dough of my ravioli noodles.
I got another brilliant idea right now. i got an egg,
I got a slingshot.
Three, two, one. - three, two, one.
That didn't work. i am now eggman.
That doesn't feel good.
Devan i am making a nice pasta sauce.
Collins holy cow, that smells so bad.
Devan well, i got my bowl here.
Now it's time to grab some of this heavy cream,
And since we're making giant pasta,
I need a giant whisk.
Bro, you put like eight whisks onto one drill.
Yes.
Whoa.
Are you on double power though.
I'm actually half trigger right now.
Collins you know what devan,
I don't think you're quite using it right.
There's actually very sound technique.
You can do with the whisk.
Can i see it for a second.
I think you should handle this from now on.
Yes, i think so.
Look at that organic, raw, fresh dough.
I think i'm going back to my magician roots right now.
Oh, look at me. look at me.
No. why'd you do that.
It's the impulse.
It came out of nowhere and i had to.
Brace yourself.
Three, two, one.
Oh. here we go.
Yeah.
This is how you mix the dough. nailed it.
Alright, here we go. three, two, one.
I gotta say yeet. i thought this would.
Work a lot better than it actually did right now.
How long does this thing take.
You're churning butter, devan.
This is what people used to do for a long time.
To make butter.
I'm getting tired.
Oh.
For this next pasta sauce, i have to.
Become a hibachi chef.
Well, if you do that i'm going to become a.
White water rafter.
Every sauce needs tomatoes.
Alright, while you do that time for me to.
Put this under here and.
Speed is of the essence.
This is a hibachi chef.
All right,  here we go.
Aw man, i gotta, okay, yup, yup, yup.
Just making all my.
All right, now you're incorporating this into my dish.
Yeah, but i'm just doing my best over here.
Oh. i got an idea. bro, you know what you need.
For yours. bam. an egg.
No, no, no, no.
No, i don't.
Yes, you do. scrambled eggs in it. absolutely.
No, i don't.
And you just need some olive oil.
Gonna mix this together and smack that.
Next up, some onions.
Holy cow.
I smacked the dough, and the dough smacked back.
Oh, boy.
Devan, you're gonna make us cry.
Get ready to cry.
Bro, i do not wanna be crying and hibachi grill.
A brilliant way of mixing this.
This is the dough roller 4000.
Why is it called the 4000.
'cause we made 3,999 other ones.
And they all sucked.
And this one's great, so here's how it works.
See you can roll out your forearms and roll out the dough.
Man, this is yours.
Devan yes.
I knew i found it somewhere in the house.
I gotta say it's very good if you wanna get.
All right, dough is all rolled out.
Devan all right, i think i got a good base started.
Now i just gotta finish it up and i'm on to my next.
Oh, collins the one thing a professional hibachi.
Chef always does is grabs one of these radishes.
Puts it on here.
And you have to catch it in your mouth.
Oh, i got this. all right here we go.
Three, two, one. - three, two, one.
Ow, in my face.
Devan three, two, one.
Okay, i don't think you're a very good hibachi chef.
Yeah, last one.
Three, two, one. - three, two, one.
Yeah. first try.
First try.
I don't like this one.
That's why i used my bad radishes on him.
Sorry what was, what was that.
We got some veggies time to tear them up.
Here we go. three, two, one. here we go.
Oh my gosh.
I got these nails on, these acrylics.
Shred the lettuce.
I might dance like this.
These things work amazing, bro.
This is incredible.
You know what i need. - holy cow.
Five pound weight.
Collins wait, what.
Devan yes.
Collins you're using weights to smash your tomatoes.
Devan yes, i am.
It seems like the most of your stuff is on the floor.
Well devan we'll be using this excuse me.
I gotta give these acrylic nails, five, ten thumbs up.
Devan for the last component of my red sauce.
I am making a mashed potato cheese.
While you do that i got the trumpet of.
Tragedy right here, devan.
What is that gonna be used for.
It's gonna blow a whole in the space-time.
Continuum.
What.
Yeah, hop behind me devan. - that sounds risky.
Do not try this at home.
Okay.
I suck at winking.
Three, two, one. - three, two, one.
Oh, snap. we got dinosaurs.
Close it. close it. close it.
Okay, there we go that was close.
You're probably wondering how i'm gonna.
Be able to break open a pineapple.
This is not a pineapple.
What is that.
Devan now i'm putting some heavy cream into.
Here to make it all nice and whipped up.
This is like a soccer ball. there's no way.
A soccer ball could whip up some cream, devan.
Oh it's, if you think this is a soccer ball,
There is something wrong.
I'm actually pretty, hey, it's a little heavy.
Hey, it's a soccer ball.
Are you all right. - my knee.
Collins time to bust this thing open. here's what.
We're gonna use. an anvil.
Three, two, one.
Let's just put it like this here.
Here we go. three, two, one.
All right let's get an extra piece.
Oh. all right, hold on one second i gotta open.
This thing up real quick.
All right, i'll totally wait for you. psych.
I'm just gonna pop this thing open real quick.
Collins all right. - just like this.
Oh. - oh my god.
Collins i don't understand how that's gonna.
Help you make a better pasta sauce, devan.
Devan well it will once i add this gruyere cheese.
Look dude it's coming together man.
Got a whole bunch of beets, you're gonna line.
These just like this. and then give me the perfect.
Flavoring for my ravioli.
All right, well here we go. got another cement block.
Over here. here we go.
Do not try this at home.
This is how you drop the beet.
Three, two, one. - three, two, one.
Boom. - oh my gosh.
There we go. yeah, that's how you do it.
Bam, that's how you mash the beets.
Okay. you broke the block.
Collins all right there we go,
So we got the beet all mashed up.
And i think i got all the elements.
I need to create my ravioli noodles.
So now it's time to put it all together.
Time to finish up the pieces of our pasta dish.
Yes.
And for me, i got my ravioli dough right here.
Next up, i gotta roll it out. so here we go.
Just continue like this. oh, look at that guys.
I got a crater right here in the center of it.
It looks like it's not doing so hot right now.
So here we go.
Devan look at that.
Collins oh my god.
Devan yes, some nice melted cheese.
All right as you're doing that i've got a whole.
Bunch of minced up lettuce here.
This. looks nasty.
Three, two, one. let's see.
Oh. - oh.
I gotta say from an initial visual standpoint it.
Doesn't look the nicest, but i promise you it's.
Gonna make my ravioli amazing.
Devan you know what dude. i think this is going.
Way too slow. you know what i need.
The octowhisk.
Oh, no. hold on i gotta put my glasses on.
Oh, snap. okay. here we go. all right, glasses on.
Three, two, one. - three, two, one.
You broke the octowhisk.
It has too much torque.
I think you should use the paddle whisk.
No.
I think it would make a lot of fun.
I think it would make a lot of mess.
Collins time to put the finishing touches.
On our dishes.
And these things are gonna look incredible.
We got the finished pasta pieces.
And now it's time for the big reveal.
And dude, your ravioli looks like little pillows.

Than wolverine claws is a giant toothbrush.
The thing is we're coming up on the new year devan,
So new year, new me.

The thing is i've been making the filling.
For my ravioli. and now it's time to bring it all together.
Gonna dump this in here like this.

I gotta say you forming the meat.
That doesn't seem like it's coming together too well, man.
Devan no, it is not.
Gonna kinda pinch it. oh. no.
I dropped the whole thing of butter in there.
Next up it is now time to mix this all around.
I'm a genius. i've done it in a salad spinner.
So it's gonna be easy.
We're gonna unleash it first. whoa.
Whoa. - whoa, my god.
Here we go. it's gonna spin around like this.
All right, now it's time to put.

You challenged us to make giant pasta so let's go.
Now it's time to make the noodles and the white sauce.
For the first part of my white sauce.
Time to freeze some coconuts in liquid nitrogen.
Devan three, two, one. it's cracking.
Collins a perfect hole in it.
Coconut number one, here we go.
Gonna place it in my trough of vegetables.
All right,
So now i'm gonna move the liquid nitrogen off to the side.
What are you doing.
Are you all right.
Yes. i gotta separate the yolk.
From the other stuff.
The egg whites.
Yes, that stuff.
Here is the big smash, ready.
Do not try this at home.
Here we go.
Three, two, one. - three, two, one.

A bowling ball.
Are you kidding me.
So here we go.
Three.
Excuse me.
Three, two, one. - three, two, one.
Devan that worked way better.
Collins that worked so good. look at this.
It like literally brought out the meat perfectly.
That was the best.
Collins devan, what are you doing.
Devan i'm sorry this egg is uncontrollable.
Control it.
This is gonna be the perfect base for my white sauce.
All right, i got all the pieces to my egg.
Now it's time to make the next part of my noodles.
I just gotta add some flour.
No. wait a minute is that for your noodles.
Yes this is for my noodles.
You are definitely making some giant noodles, devan.
I gotta say that is very impressive.
Well i've got this massage blaster right here.
It's time to tenderize some coconut meat.
Oh, yup. here we go. oh, man.
Devan, so how are the noodles going for you man.
Devan oh, not great.
All right. the meat is tenderized.
Into a nice, fine powder.
This is gonna be the base of my white sauce.
I got my pillow case here.
And i got a whole bunch of dirt.
It's time to harvest some vegetables.
Oh, wow, okay.
The thing is i've been planting.
A whole bunch of dirt recently.
Veggies.
I'm not sure that's how this works.
You're questioning my dirt.
What are you doing with a pillow case and some, oh snap.
Well normally what you do is put it in a small bag.
But i got a pillow case.
Here we go. well as you're doing this,
Here we go. we'll get a couple of my.
That's how all chefs do it.
Devan i got a good pile of dough now.
So now it's time to make the noodles.
Collins i'm gonna mince up all my veggies, here.
That is how you mince, man.
I'm using the pizza technique.
Devan well that looks pretty intense.
I got some bananas, some liquid nitrogen,
A whole bunch of flavoring, and about to go in.
My ravioli.
I just gotta put this thing on.
Oh, snap.
Yo. look at that dude it's making the noodles.
Devan i know.
Collins holy cow.
I gotta poke it through.
All right, here we go.
I gotta take my banana and drop it in here.
Three, two, one.
It's in.
The banana is freezing in the liquid nitrogen.
That is getting very long, devan.
Oh, no. oh my god.
Devan dude this thing is so difficult.
Oh man. it fell off.
Oh, they both broke.
Collins my liquid nitrogen still is in full course.
Right now.
And this is gonna be perfect to add into the dough.
Of my ravioli noodles.
We've got all the frozen fruits and vegetables.
Now it's time to smash them.
We're gonna kick it off with a dragon fruit right now.
This is gonna be perfect for the flavoring.
Of my ravioli.
I gotta say and for giant noodles,
Those are looking a little short.
You know.
Oh yeah. i think you're right.
I have an idea.
A pool noodle.
Hey, whoa.
Yes. and now for the dragon fruit.
No. the dragon fruit is mine.
Holy cow. - oh geez.
Collins next up we've got the orange.
So here we go man.
Oh, yeah. drop it on top.
Whoa, i got some noodles on here.
I'm sorry. here we go. let's see.
I spent a long time on those.
Three, two, one. - three, two, one.
Devan save the noodles.
Save the noodles.
Wait, so let me make this clear.
You're putting noodles in a pool noodle.
Exactly.
Okay. now it's time for the tomato next.
So here we go. tomato.
Versus bowling ball.
Who do you think is gonna win.
Devan tomato.
Collins yeah. the tomato i agree.
Three, two, one. - three, two, one.
Collins that was crazy.
Wait so what are you gonna do stuff it in there.
Devan yes but it dropped out of the bottom.
Collins oh that's not good.
All right my noodle is all filled up.
Now it's time to cut it open.
All right it is all cut open.
And there's my noodle, man.
Dude, that noodle is huge.
I know right.
Collins i'm gonna dump out all the remaining.
Frozen pieces out over here.
So now it's time to smash.
Ready. here we go.
Three, two, one. - three, two, one.
Devan it's the eighth wonder of the world.
Collins it is.
It's a giant noodle.
It's coming out of this noodle right over here.
Yes.
There you go. that's how you get rid of the noodle.
Devan i think it just needs to be cleaned up.
And it's all good.
I'm just gonna have to collect all this flavor here,
But that's awesome.
Now it's time to for me to finish up my white sauce.
Right here.
Devan i got my noodles here to finish up.
Exactly. got a huge spoon over here.
It's got a whole bunch of minced up.
Coconut right here.
So here we go.
On the white sauce,
Just gonna add it in right now like there we go.
Now time to add in the veggies like that.
There we go.
That's gonna add a whole bunch of nice flavor to mine.
Yes.
And last but not least, i have to be very sparing.
With how much i add of this.
We've got over here all the different pieces.
That we hit with the liquid nitrogen.
So here we go.
You did a good job collecting all that.
Thank you.
Now for me to put the finishing touches on my sauce.
It's very cold right now.
Yes.
And then i have to make a bunch more noodles.
Exactly. i think those are gonna look great.
When you finally finish them up.
We've got the finished pasta.
And these things are crazy.
These are massive. i can barely reach across.
Here's the big reveal.
Three, two, one. ta-da. - three, two, one. ta-da.
Collins oh my gosh.
Devan wow. look at them.
I cannot believe we actually pulled it off.
No, no, no. don't try that bro.
It is so heavy.
Collins this meatball is like 60 pounds.
Devan i know right.
And those are like full.
Time to dig in.
So devan, which delicious dish.
Are we going to eat first.
Oh man, i mean. mine looks pretty crazy.
Yours has all these mystery ingredients on the inside.
And it's like ravioli in a soup,
Which is new.
Let's do this a rock, paper, scissors for who will.
Eat first.
All right. i'm down.
Winner, that's the dish we try first.
So here we go.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
Yes.
Oh, okay. best two out of three.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
No.
Oh, okay. this is where it all comes down to.
Here we go.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
Oh, man. - yes.
Collins all right. i guess we eat yours first.
So how do we even tackle this dish man.
I think we to start we grab our giant fork and knife.
I think i'm just gonna cut off a big piece of this.
Side here like this.
Oh my god. that's more than a burger right there, devan.
We didn't really sharpen these very well.
Yeah, these are very dull. very safe, large knives.
So i got a piece of the meatball right here.
Collins oh, man. you're cutting the noodle next right.
Devan gonna grab some of these doughy noodles right here.
Collins that sinks right in.
Yeah those are. did you even cook them.
I tried.
They look thoroughly undercooked.
As you can see guys i really focused.
On this meatball.
I can tell.
It's time for me to do something,
I wish i did a long time ago.
Okay.
It got in my eye.
Your meatball is like a rock.
Here's what i'm gonna do.
I'm gonna take this fork. again, manners.
I learned this from kevin.
Just stick it like that and then just kinda like bam,
Slicey, slicey, slicey.
Gonna scoop off a little bit of noodle over here.
That's about all i want.
I know it's a giant noodle,
But i gotta say i'm not the most excited to try it.
Time to see how these taste,
And although these are extremely dull,
Still do not try this at home.
No.
Do not eat off of a knife.
So let's see how this tastes.
Here we go.
Three, two, one. - three, two, one.
Hold on are you going for it. oh, man.
Oh, god.
Those noodles. i can't even swallow it,
It's so bad.
Wow. that was real bad.
Oh no. that was like,
I don't think you seasoned it right.
With this terrible review on this one,
I don't know how good yours is gonna be.
Yeah, i gotta say man.
'cause if you put some spices in yours,
I put some spices in mine.
Paper towel attack.
Would you mind cleaning. here we go.
Sure, yes.
Did you cook yours.
If it's any consolation,
Did you not cook yours too.
Again, try cooking a three foot ravioli, bro.
Devan it's not cooked just like mine.
Collins i'm trying my best, okay.
You roasted me so hard for this.
I'm sorry.
Three, two, one. oh. look at that shrimp.
Oh, man. i forgot all the stuff you put in there.
You know i was really excited to eat mine,
But i'm not excited to eat yours.
Collins well the thing is,
I made different ones over here.
Slice open the top of this one, bam.
Here we go, bam.
Look at that. look at those.
Close that one back up.
That's even worse.
Not my best work.
I'm just gonna kinda stab it over here like this.
Scoopity doop.
Could you imagine if we all used this big of utensils.
I think we would get a lot more eating done.
I'm gonna try to, and this is so tough.
See, i helped you devan,
But you haven't helped me once.
You want me to use my hands.
You know what. forget about the utensils.
We're going in with the hands,
So here we go.
Let's just take out this.
Scoop up some of the inside.
Bam, check it out.
I know it kinda defeats the purpose,
But mini ravioli.
Important to point this out,
Devan and i will not be eating this all by ourselves.
We'll share this with our friends, family,
Literally anyone.
We're gonna feed us for like a week right here.
Again, do not eat food off a giant utensil.
Yes.
Do not recommend.
Three, two. - three, two.
We just launched our brand new merch.
We got a whole bunch of crazy new designs,
We know you're gonna love.
So click the top link in the description right now.

Let's see how it tastes.
Three, two, one. - three, two, one.
Whoa.
