Back to school challenge.
I'mma juggle these things to start this off,
'cause we need energy.
Oh, my gosh, you're so good.
Let's get this started.
Round number one, a friend of ours put a whole bunch.
Of random stuff in these backpacks,
And hidden amongst them are three things.
That we have to find.
Scissors, a pencil sharpener, and a glue stick,
And whoever can find all these items first,
They win round one.
Three, two, one, go.
I shouldn't a zipped them closed, okay here we go.
Hey, hey, hey.
What.
Yo, i'm not gonna say my friend rigged this.
Or anything, but my friend has rigged this.
What just happened.
Actually, i have a secret power,
No i'm kidding.
Hey, i'll take the loss.
I'll take it, i lose round one, so.
Sorry.
Congratulations, you win round one.
And a fun thing to add is that every round you win,
You get to put on one of these apple stickers.
'cause, i guess, you give a teacher apples.
If only i was healthy enough to eat one of these.
So, you get your first official apple sticker.
Awe, so cute.
That is round number one.
Let me actually find my freaking pencil sharpener now.
It's got be here somewhere.
Oh, there we go, at the bottom of all the pen's.
The sharpener.
So, for round, we've made such a mess.
For round number two, whoever can sharpen their pencil.
The most in 30 seconds, they win that round, so.
Set timer for 30--.
Siri what was that again.
I didn't even start yet.
Set timer for 30 seconds.
Siri okay, your timer is set--.
Oh, gee, it's going.
I need to figure out a system for this.
Oh, gees.
I feel like i'm breaking mine, okay.
Whoo.
Oh, we only have 10 seconds left.
This like a wrist workout, man, ow.
Three, two, one, and stop.
Okay, what happened.
I think it's kinda clear who won this,
No there's no technical difficulty.
Me, obviously, yeah.
This is clearly a great, oh gosh, help me.
So now we are tied, and now i get my very own.
Apple sticker, and i'm going for the--.
Put it on your cheek.
For you.
I don't know if i can do it.
Upon further reconsideration, i don't think,
It doesn't work for me.
So, i'm gonna be baller with it.
Wear it like a man.
Come at me, bro, come at me.
For round number three, we have to put as many loose.
Leaf papers in these paper protectors as possible.
In 45 seconds.
Whoever can do that wins round three.
And will take the lead, so here we go.
Hey, siri, put 45 seconds on the clock for me,
Will ya, fam.
Siri okay, i found this on the web.
For put 45 seconds on the clock for me will ya fam.
Both will ya fam.
Will ya fam, no. - isn't that.
Okay, let me do it again.
Hey, siri--.
Siri sorry collins, i didn't get that.
Oh, shady.
Hey, siri, 45 seconds on the clock.
Do it.
Siri 22.5.
Hey, siri, 45 second timer.
Siri done, i love a good countdown.
All right, let's go, let's go.
Oh, my gosh.
I feel like i'm gonna fail at this miserably.
It's stressful to do.
I'm assuming you don't do a lot of--.
In, in.
Okay, there we go, boom, one.
Oh, wait, you have to go one in each.
Yeah, one in each.
Oh.
Oh, you're trying to put 'em all.
Oh, i see how it is.
Where's the opening of this, there we go.
Okay, i'm not winning this at all.
Here we go.
I need one more.
Wait, ah, where's the opening.
Okay.
Just go, no.
Kay, how many did you do.
One.
One, okay.
I got two.
So, i'll take round three.
I get one more apple.
That was the most stressful thing of all time.
Trying to get them open was so--.
Right.
It was like something about it was cringey.
Like something about putting it in there was like.
Eh, like nails on a chalkboard.
Cringey is the best word to use to describe this.
I'm going green apple for this one, and i'm.
Gonna do matching, bam.
Round four, let's get it.
And we're going on to round number four,
And this one here involves locks, because you guys know.
You have locks on your locker.
So, for this challenge, whoever can unlock their lock.
The fastest wins.
So, here's what we're gonna do.
Locks on the table.
Here, we'll mix it up first.
Oh, okay, okay.
You good.
We're all good.
Hands on the table.
Here we go, three, hands on the table.
Two.
Sorry, i had to flip my hair.
Two, one, begin.
Um, it is--.
This is my workout for today.

What was the last one.
Eight.
Bam.
No.
Oh, yeah.
No.
That's 'cause--.
Wait, mine didn't even.
You were homeschooled.
Ho, ho.
We are tied now, going into round number five.
The tie-breaker round.
Whoever wins this round gets to have the loser do.
Something super embarrassing on snapchat.
So, first of all, pick an apple.
I wanna keep it consistent.
Awe.
This really is boys versus girls.
Game time.
Girls like, on the cheek, it's so cute.
I'm like, "man patches with my apples.".
All right, here we go.
This is the tie-breaker round,
And for this last one, we have to make a sandwich.
Fully complete the sandwich.
We don't have ziploc bags, so we're gonna put it.
In one of the page protectors.
And then, you have to seal it, oh why is there lettuce.
In here.
And then you have to put it inside of your lunch box.
Zip it all the way up, and whoever does that first.
Wins the final round.
Loser has to do some embarrassing things on snapchat.
We'll put the video of that at the end of this challenge.
Oh, my god.
Three, two, one, go.
But that tear, doe.
Oh, i would do anything for the carbs.
This is making me hungry, too, 'cause i haven't.
Eaten all day, yet.
Oh, really.
All right, there we go.
Tasteful amount of mustard, not too much.
Um.
Whoa, my tomatoes.
Just squeezing it.
There we go, bam, tomato.
Ah, what else do i need on there.
Lettuce, okay.
No, no.
So, i'm good, okay, here we go, boom.
No, no, no, no.
Yes.
Ah, ah, ah.
He's missing cheese.
No.
And guess who has the cheese.
No, give me the cheese.
Give me the cheese.
This is unfair, okay.
That's my slice.
Ah, no.
And you threw it so far, too.
All right, here we, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Okay.
I lost my tomato.
Bam, i won.
Yes.
No, you have to zip it.
You gotta zip it.
Wait you can't zip it.
Yes, you can.
Wait, zip, no, no, no, no.
Wait, wait.
Yes, whoo.
No, that was not zipped up.
That was the exact same time.
Wow.
Well, that went zero to 100 real quick.
So, i think.
That was a tie.
'cause that was a tie--.
Look what i did.
We're both, for this, gonna do embarrassing things.
On our snapchat.
You said you didn't eat all day.
Do you want this.
I'm good.

So, right now, we're 'bout to do some embarrassing things.
On our snapchat.
But, yeah.
Should we say what we're both gonna do.
Oh, i tried the mustard, that was gross.
