The last time, i kind of like,
I tried to use magic to get a girlfriend.
They said central park.
Central park.
Oh my god.
Thank you so much.
Collins i think something went a little.
Bit amiss in the magic last time,
Because i guess she had a boyfriend.
And so i'm still single, i don't.
Have a girlfriend anymore so, i never had one.
So the collins that's on stage.
Is the collins that's at home with us.
And so when people meet him on the street.
Can we have the picture.
Yeah, let's do it, yeah, yeah.
It's the same kid, they're not.
Getting something different.
Collins i almost gave up magic,
Just 'cause like peer pressure.
When you're doing something that.
Not everyone else is doing, it's.
Definitely that pressure of like,
Well what are you doing out there.
You should come back here with the group.
You should come back here with everyone else.
And so i almost gave it up and.
It was really my parents who, like,
Encouraged me like, no if you like.
To do it, go for it.
Anne this means the world to him,
And for something that can set him.
For the rest of his life, doing what he loves to do.
Collins i think to win the show.
Would be incredible, because not.
Only would i be the youngest magician,
I would be the only magician.
I'm gonna do literally everything to make it to the finals.
Tonight, i'm putting 250,000 dollars on the line.
Now it's not my money, it's nick's.
