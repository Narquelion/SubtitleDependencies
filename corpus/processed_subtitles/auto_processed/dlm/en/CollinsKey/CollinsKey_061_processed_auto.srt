Have you ever stuffed your face with so much ice cream.
That it gave you a brain freeze.
Well today, we're turning just everyday foods.
Into the ultimate brain freeze with liquid nitrogen.
And i asked you guys on instagram,
"what are some crazy foods you would love to see me freeze".
"and then smash with a hammer.".
So, right now, let's do it.
We're kicking it off with some peeps, y'all.
Let's just forget i ever did that.
And how this works, there are three steps to it.
Step one, we're gonna place a normal peep down.
And then smash it.
Step two, we're gonna take another peep,
Deep freeze it, and then step three,
Place it down and then smash the deep freezed peep.
Let's peep this out.
I can't do that.
That's like some random food channels line.
No one's gonna get that reference, but devin w.
Let's, let's go.
It's time to choose the sacrificial peep.
I choose, this one right.
Here we go, step one, smash the normal peep.
Turn it like a peep pancake.
Let's see what happens when we deep freeze it.
Alright so i'm using this dipper right here.
To get the liquid nitrogen,
And we're gonna dump it on the peep to deep freeze it.
So this is going to take some accuracy,
See if i can get it.
It's like sizzling off the.
It's cracking.
Alright here we go, round two.
This stuff is hitting the table, this stuff is crazy,
This stuff is super dangerous by the way,
So if you ever do this, make sure.
You do it with parental supervision.
This looks crazy,
Oh i want to like touch it.
It's s. you can hear it cracking,
It is solid right now.
This is crazy, i'm gonna do one more round.
I feel so bad man, this peep, rest in peace bro.
No, rest in peep, hah.
But before we smash the frozen one, i've got a challenge.
I want to see if you can subscribe to this channel,
And turn on the channel post notifications.
In five seconds, here we go.
Five, four, three, two, one, done.
If you can do that, comment down below "keyper squad".
Right now, we're smashing it.
Three, two, one,
That was crazy, that was so cool.
I am lit, that was so sick.
Alright, next one here we go.
Shoutout to everyone who suggested.
One of my favorite foods, sushi.
So, we're gonna be freezing this stuff,
We're also gonna be smashing regular,
And then of course,
Going to be eating the stuff.
Let's go.
This one hits home,
Out of all the ones i did not expect.
To blow up all over me, it was my friend sushi.
So this piece here looks like the most colorful one,
So we're gonna do this one.
This feels like you're at an expensive restaurant,
And like you know when you see them.
Doing crazy things with the food,
Like using blow torches and stuff.
This feels like something you would see.
In an expensive restaurant.
They're like "oh you want your sushi a little bit colder.".
And then's like.
Huh, it's making me sneeze.
So here's what's gonna happen,
I'm actually, i'm gonna tilt this back.
Oh my gosh, it's like half frozen.
The bottom is rock solid frozen,
But the top, the top is not cooperating.
Come on sushi, you supposed to be my best friend.
Aw, spicy.
The sushi is proving to be a lot more difficult.
Than i initially anticipated.
So right now, we're actually going to take.
The whole thing, and submerge it in the liquid nitrogen.
No more of this foo-foo little drizzling.
You know things are getting extreme,
When the camo glasses come out.
Whoa, the whole world is very yellow at the moment.
Alright, we're gonna dump this whole thing.
Here we go,
Yes, it's not heavy at all, okay.
Alright here we go, this is super dangerous.
Oh my gosh.
Alright here we go.
I would use chopsticks, but you know what,
Now is not the time for tradition.
It's not coming off, it's frozen.
We're going with this piece.
It's in there guys.
We're making a delicacy right now,
The sushi is in there, in the liquid nitrogen.
It's a frozen block.
It's literally a frozen block.
Alright guys, time to smash it.
Three, two, one.
That one.
Ah, that scratched my eye on the way out.
Who ever knew the safety glasses.
Would be the most dangerous part.
Of that whole operation right there.
Let's do the next one.
I've been instructed i'm not allowed to touch the donuts,
Because they're afraid i'm gonna eat it.
I doe-nut know why,
Nope that's bad.
Alright right now, it's time to smash a donut, let's do it.
This one might be kind of graphic,
You may wanna look away.
Okay, i thought this one was gonna blow up and go crazy,
But it just literally just like flattened.
Let's see what happens with a frozen one.
Alright we've got the tongs right now,
The donut is going into the liquid nitrogen.
Oh my gosh, it's floating.
This thing is like floating on it man.
I gotta submerge it, submerge, go submarine mode.
It's a submarine donut.
Here we go, three, two, one.
The hammer's like smoking.
Aw i love this stuff man.
That sounded like glass breaking,
Like for a second i was like oh my gosh,
I'm about to get hit with like a shard of glass donut.
It makes no sense, i'm hyped, this is crazy.
Let's go to the next one.
Next up we are freezing and smashing oreos.
Woman off screen hey, we need that for the video.
Here we go,
I literally just thought a piece of this flew off,
Into the liquid nitrogen container.
Luckily it's closed, we're all good.
Otherwise it could have erupted, i don't know.
So let's now freeze it, and see what happens.
We're using the different technique again for this oreo.
Like this stuff just sizzles,
Which is the craziest thing about it.
Let's smash this oreo.
Three, two, one.
Oh, what.
Look at this, it didn't even break.
What, i am smashing this again fam.
What is going on.
Attempt number two, let's do this.
Not a pickle in a bag.
But it'll do.
You have to eat a pickle in a bag.
Alright here we go.
Oh no, it's already getting juicy.
I hate the small of pickles.
I smell like pickles y'all.
I don't even want to do this.
It feels like a messy challenge all over again.
It's like pickle, just, just nastiness.
Woman off screen eww, it's like jelly.
Oh, it's in my eyeball.
Oh that burns, that burns a lot.
Here we go, three, two, one.
Oh no, i can't believe it didn't do anything.
I guess we'll have to freeze it.
No i can't, i can't do that.
We gotta go for it.
I got pickle all over me.
Alright let's freeze it.
It looks like just like bird poo just.
Now this, is what you call a juicy pickle.
Here we go, oh i need my.
Almost put that in without my glove.
That woulda been very bad.
Okay, the juciest of all pickles.
Yo, this is so wild.
There's almost like a, i don't know how to describe it,
There's like a layer of mist over the top of it.
But you can't see it, but the moment the pickle.
Gets close to it, look at this.
It like envelopes the pickle.
You see that, look.
It's like a layer over the top of it.
I'm sure there's like scientific reason for it,
But that's wild.
Alright here we go, we're gonna plop the pickle in.
I can't see the pickle man.
You know what, there's just not enough.
Liquid nitrogen in there,
We've gotta fill it up a little more.
Yeah.
Pickles been in there for quite a little while,
We've got the hammer right now, and let's pull it out.
It's actually cracked.
Look at this.
Can you see, like it's got a crack.
Right along it right there.
This is gonna be explosive.
Here we go, three, two, one.
That one sounded like glass shattering.
This one is the most popular item you guys suggested,
It's a piece.
A piece, of pizza.
Sorry, no more uh, cheesy jokes.
Get it, 'cause it's a cheese p.
I'm not looking forward to this one.
This is gonna go everywhere.
Three two one.
That was it.
Hey guys, it looks like a topographical map of utah,
Haha jokes, dad jokes.
For those of you who are pizza lovers,
This might be hard to watch.
So that's just like just a part of it,
And you can already tell the difference.
Like it's rock solid.
Wait, we're gonna go with the whole piece of pizza in there.
Ooh man, it's sizzling.
The moment it touches it,
The whole consistency of it is completely changes.
This no longer feels like a piece of pizza,
It feels like a slab of rock.
Listen to that sound, crazy.
Alright, time to smash it.
Here we go.
Okay before i go for this last one,
It is just shattered.
Come here, look at this.
Like the cheese actually shattered on it.
Like i can kinda pick it up a little bit.
It looks crazy.
Like the whole thing is just kinda broken apart.
I'm gonna give it one final smash right now.
There's a big one, here we go.
Three, two, don't want to break the plate, one.
Yeah, that was cool.
Have you ever seen those commercials.
Where they try to make eating a burger.
Look like the hottest thing on the entire planet.
Well right now, we're not gonna do that.
This is gonna be the exact opposite of that.
Like after this, no one is gonna wanna eat this burger.
So,
This here, has got icicles like all the way around it now.
And this side you can kinda like scoop it off,
It looks like snow almost.
So right now, the camo glasses are going back on.
We're about to fill it up again,
And this burger's going down.
Here we go, the moment of truth.
About to pop the burger into the liquid nitrogen.
Oh man, it's going everywhere.
Okay.
So the burger's in, i gotta keep it together,
So i gotta push it down quickly.
What's happening, i can't see it,
My glasses are like impeding my vision,
And i'm like everything's so yellow.
I can't tell where the burger's at anymore.
It's having a crazy reaction,
This one by far the craziest.
Hopefully, the burger will freeze.
This one's the most difficult though,
Because there's so many layers to what's going on.
Like the burger just has a ton of different layers,
And so i don't know if it's gonna be able to.
Freeze through every single layer.
So i'm gonna keep this one in here.
Longer than i normally would.
Well the cheese is definitely no longer melted,
That's for sure.
In case you guys ever wanted to know,
This is the secret recipe for the krabby patty.
Y'all didn't even know,
Liquid nitrogen was the key all along.
It's literally cracking.
Alright, here we go,
Three, two, one.
It's like a magic trick man.
It's just gone.
Well there's a chunk of it over here.
Woo, woo, woo.
It's like so cold, it's so hot right now.
That makes no sense, but if you touch this,
You can feel it even through these gloves,
Like it's like a burn on your finger.
Really guys, eggs.
You know i don't like messy videos.
Nunununo, no, no, no.
This is gonna be so bad.
I'm doing this for you, here we go.
Three, oh no, two, one.
I'm good, it didn't touch me at all.
Alright cool, next one let's go.
Here we go.
I gotta say, i'm very grateful that i still.
Have a face at the moment,
Because that slipped, and you saw that stuff.
Shoot out everywhere.
And if that were to touch my skin,
That would burn my skin, and my skin would instantly die.
All's well that ends well.
The coolest thing, is that when it fell in there.
It actually cracked.
And look at it, it's like the opposite of scrambled eggs.
So guys, we're gonna put a full one in.
So guys, we're gonna put a full one in there now,
Just so we know what like,
The whole egg will actually look like.
Alright, so the full egg actually cracked.
While it was inside.
So i don't know what kind of effect that will have.
We're gonna do this one first,
And then next we're gonna do this mutant egg.
The craziest thing about this one,
Is that it cracked, but the shell stayed intact,
But only the egg whites actually came out of the egg,
But the shell it's still full intact.
Here we go, three, two, one.
Oh my gosh, literally powderized it.
We're going for egg number two right now,
Here we go guys, the mutant egg.
Three,  two, one.
It's literally just powder.
So i don't think i've ever seen eggs.
Prepared in this particular fashion before.
You guys suggested twinkies,
I suggest i do it like salt bae.
So let's see what happens.
You guys, i'm not excited about this one.
This, is gonna be juicy.
Here we go.
This experiment has been so full of surprises,
Like the ones you'd expect to just explode everywhere,
Have done nothing, and then the ones.
That just came out of no where, sushi.
Why would the sushi go everywhere,
But the twinkie filling inside of it would not.
It's actually stuck to the just ta. it's just.
I don't know what to say.
Everyone say goodbye to the twinkie.
Here we go, making the plunge.
Whoa, hold up.
My tongs, got stuck to it.
Alright i'm gonna have to use a different twinkie,
This thing is just woo, messed up.
I'm just gonna have to like, kinda like plop it in.
Very safely.
Wanna go far away from it, here we go.
Three, two, one, here we go, ooh.
The twinkie's just like, floating along the surface.
Alright, so it's kinda sinking in a little bit,
I'm gonna try to like rotate it.
Flip it upside down would be like ideal,
Oh okay there we go, yep.
The first time we did this, nothing happened.
This time, after it's been frozen, here we go.
About to smash it, and then eat it.
But first, i need your help.
