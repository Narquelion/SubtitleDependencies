For this next round.
Bro, bro-- - i'm so scared.
With my eyes closed around you.
You're already in a good stance,
Because this next one,

You must use one of your other five senses,
Which is karate.
What.
Just start swingin',
Karate choppin'.
You totally missed.
Ow.
Ow.

I guess we gotta put it in the cereal now.
Next round, let's go.
All right, collins, this next one is.
Very large.
And very hairy.
What.
I've never heard of a hairy candy before.
What are you doing.
I'm trying to get it out of the package,
It's that big.
And it bites.
It bites really badly.
All right, you ready for it.
Three,
Two,

And he goes for the bite.
That hurt.
Just go out and bite.
Leap of faith, bro.
You got this.
Your lips look hilarious, bro.
Gummy snake,
A gummy snake.
Yes. - yes.
It's not a gummy snake, bro.
I'm celebrating-- - oh no.
Hairy.
A bear.
Oh, and every round,
I've forgotten about the.
Necklace of shame.
That's right.
Sorry.
Here, i'm gonna choose this one for you.
Oh, my gosh.
It looks like bubble gum.
You can't take that one.
We gotta give you a worse one, dude.
What. no.
How 'bout this one here.
There's a string in it.
Here we go,
Three,
Two,
One.
Ow, ow, ow.
Dude, are you okay.
Will this soothe you.
Do you want some of that.
Not a good combo.
Ow.
I bit down really hard.
All right, add it to the cereal.
There we go.
Aw, missed.
This one, devin.
Yeah.
Good luck.
That is paper.
Open up your mouth.
Three, two, one.
Ow, you bit my thumb.
Devin bit my thumb.
Oh.
I have no idea.
It tastes like some sort of buttons or something.
That's it.
Jumbo buttons.
No, really.
Well done.
I'm not happy about this.
All right, i'm gonna take this one here.
All right, go for it.
Oh, and can't forget the necklace of shame.
Okay be careful, be careful.
Ow, ow, ow, ow.
You're really bad at putting it on.
Let's see what we got.
Sour lifesaver thingies.
This is not a lifesaver.
This has got to be somethin' else, man.
Here we go.
Three,
Two,
One.
I'm just gonna take one of these.
Here we go,
We're gonna add these in to the cereal.
These are really good.
All right, and next up,
We have these reese's-.
I mean.
Did you just give it away.
No, no i did not.
Nope, did not give it away at all.
I smell peanut butter.
I know exactly what this is.
I don't think there's anything i could do.
To mask the smell,
Other than put a lollipop under your nose.
Oh my gosh, these come in,
Like, a cake platter.
Stop.
Please stop touching my nose with it.
I'll stay really still.
We're flyin' in.
All i smell is peanut butter.
Give me the reese's,
And i can tell you it's reese's.
And then i will win this challenge.
But it's not reese's at all.
It's this, here,
Taste it.
Ah, ah, ah.
See, it's not reese's, bro.
That was, like, that hurt.
What was that.
I feel like the jig is up,
Dude, you can smell peanut butter.
This looks incredible.
Go for it.
What happened.
You got none of the reese's pieces-ness.
It's so good.
Dude, you keep on spilling it.
The necklace of shame.
You must wear it again.
I knew this was coming.
And now, devin,
Choose your sour candy.
All right, i got it, this is my bag.
What did i get.
Oh no.
This could probably be the worst one i think.
We've ever gotten.
Dude, those look like they're lemon flavored, for sure.
Oh, and the malic acid.
There's so much.
All right, here we go.
Three,
Two,
One.
Whoa.
It's probably the most sour thing i've ever had.
Let's add them to the bowl right now.
This one here is massive.
This is at least 12 times the normal.
All the way out, all the way out.
Ew.
And then bite down.
I can't.
My teeth are stuck.
Oh.
Tastes like chocolate.
It tastes like another hershey's.
You didn't give me another hershey's.
To throw me off, did you.
What is it, devin.
It's a hershey's bar.
No.
You didn't get it.
What.
It's a hershey's kiss.
So, you lost by just a little bit.
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
We should let them decide.
Comment down below if you think i got that right.
I don't think you did,
So choose a bag, devin.
Wait, what are these.
I can't even squeeze it.
They're, like, super hard.
That's not a good sign.
Yeah, no, that's not good at all.
Oh my gosh.
Oh, wow,
These get sweet really fast though.
Try another one.
You're not chipping another tooth, bro.
So i'm gonna add these to the cereal.
And, so far, devin's the one losing this challenge.
Of course, the necklace of shame.
There we go.
So devin, you lost the challenge.
Which means you need to eat the most sour bowl of cereal.
In the entire world.
Dude, it looks so sour.
Yeah, it's gonna blow your taste buds out of your mouth.
Your expectations might be a little too high.
I wanna bring it down just a little bit.
Wait, bro, but where's the milk.
There's milk in cereal right.
For the milk,
We've got sour soda.
Wait, no.
Exactly.
Here we go,
We're gonna add in the sour soda.
Oh, snap.
Here we go.
The sourest bowl of cereal in the entire world.
Take your bite.
This looks crazy.
Oh, dude, the banana.
