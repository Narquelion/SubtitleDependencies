What's up, guys.
I'm collins key, and i'm here in the dressing room with.
All fifth harmony.
I am really excited because today.
I have a super special video for all of you.
Every video, i ask you guys to comment down below.
With who you guys want to see me do magic for.
And when i was looking through the comments,
The number one name i saw was fifth harmony.
If you love fifth harmony, let me know.
By liking this video.
And let's get to the magic.
Camila any card.
Collins any card.
Boop.
Collins the joker.
Yeah.
Collins all right, cool, so take it out.
And what i want you to do, actually,
If i can get your autograph.
All right, you can just take the card and just sign it.
Okay.
Sorry i write like a third grader.
Collins it's all good.
Heh.
Collins cool, cool, alright cool.
So basically the reason i have you sign it.
Is because, that way, there is only one card.
Like this with this exact signature in the entire world.
It's impossible to duplicate it.
So this is going to be your card.
So you can feel it, the ink won't come off.
Nope. won't come off.
Collins check it out so we use your joker.
Check this out.
I'm going to try to fold it up a little bit.
And i want you to actually open up your mouth.
Okay. well.
And i want you to bite on the card.
Cool, alright here we go.
So here, i'll use my own card here.
Jack of hearts.
So here, i'll sign the jack.
Get a shot of this.
Like that. you saw my signed jack.
Alright so what's going to happen here,
Camila tastes funny.
Collins tastes funny, right.
Yeah tastes like sharpie.
Blue cards taste better, actually.
Check it out, watch.
See my jack right here. check this out.
Put it down.
Alright, so watch this.
