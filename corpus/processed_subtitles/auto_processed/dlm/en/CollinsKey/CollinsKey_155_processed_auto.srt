Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, is that glazed.
Devan hold on.
There's, like, already, like, chunks taken out of it.
Devan wait. i'm sorry. what's --.
I'm, i'm super suspicious.
What has been done to this watermelon.
I feel like, this one looks like it's the bad one,
But in reality, that's the bad one.
Alright, so they're gonna do the sour watermelon.
We've got the real watermelon.
Our's looks very tampered with, like,
If this was in the store i would immediately ask for my.
Money back. - i'm very suspicious.
This looks -- ah. sorry, it's just watermelon.
Why am i trippin'. alright, ya'll ready.
Dude what's that.
Scared me. so, i was about to like, fling this.
Watermelon's about to be on the ceiling.
So i guess we're all gonna go at the same time.
Oh, she already went. - oh, she's already in.
It looks tampered with, but i'm sure.
It's just a regular watermelon.
Sourest watermelon ever.
There's gotta be nothing different about,
I mean, nothing's popping out of it, there's nothing.
Alright, here we go, three, two, one.
Ah.
Savannah so sour.
Ah. - my lip is burning.
What did, what did you do to it.
Are we really puttin', i guess we're puttin this.
Super sour watermelon in, i guess we put.
It in along with the sour candy.
As well. - should we put these too.
They are sour.
Yeah. - yeah, we'll do both,
So, yeah. go for it. - that's a good one.
She's goin' for all of'em.
No, no. that's good.
Alright, yeah, we're gonna call it off with that.
On to the next round.
Alright, but i'ma take another bite.
This next one, we kinda have.
A hint of what it is. it's lollipop.
So here we go. you get to pull it off.
Three, two, one.
Yes. yes. - we got the sour one.
Devan she's already goin' for it.
The worst thing with, like, a sour lollipop.
Is like, it's not like you can chew on that gummy.
To get rid of the sour, it's like you're licking sour.
Collins oh, no.
Okay. - collins oh, no.
Oh, no.
Babe, you gotta, like, get rid of it.
Ouch.
It hurts, right. - devan oh, no.
I'm gonna go for this big powder spot, right here.
Devan oh, no. - collins dude, really.
Devan oh.
Oh, and you got more than i did.
You are like, so much more powder.
So, i think, i think unfortunately.
For the lollipop, we can't stick it in.
I think we're gonna move on to the.
Next round right now, but in thought --.
Why don't we just do this.
Yeah just give it a good dunk.
There you go.
Just, some good old saliva dna sourness. it's all good.
Alright guys, next round. here we go.
