Devin dry ice smash.
Collins wait, what. holy cow, dude.
Devin look at that.
Collins holy cow.
You challenged us to make.
Three insane superhero gadgets.
Out of food.
We're making an infinity gauntlet,
Captain america's shield,
And the green goblin gadget.
We're literally throwing off of.
Our balcony, so let's go.
Devin so this is going to be.
The filing for my gadget.
Collins time to make some spun honey.
I've got some green food coloring.
In honey right now.
Going to turn on the contraption over here,
Do not try this at home.
For our first edible art piece,
We're making a green goblin gadget from spider-man.
Three.
Both two.

Devin should i be, like,
Stepping back at all.
Collins dude.
Devin yo.
Both whoa. oh.
Collins that is so cool, man.

Turn off the machine, and now it's time.
For me to get in there with my hands and.
Collect all the different spun honey right now.
What is that.
Devin i got some heavy cream here.
I'm going to put into this bowl.
Collins here we go.
I'm going to reach in, let's see.
How it feels. oh, my g--owww.
It feels like spider webs.
Oh, i don't like it.
I mean, look at it.
It looks like spider webs.
Devin i know.
Collins oh, now, man, it's so crazy. okay.
Devin okay, now i'm adding some food coloring.
Collins boom. a bushel of spun honey.

Collins holy cow.
Devin this is amazing.
This is going to be.
The inside of my gadget.
Collins the inside is going to be bubbling.
Devin yeah, it actually activates it and.
It bubble like this.
Collins now i'm making the first.
Element of my tesseract.
So, as you do that,
I've got my ice over here.
Woo-hoo. whoa.
That was kind of insane.
All right.
I meant to grab it in a normal fashion,
Devin uh huh.
Collins it didn't go that way.
So here we go. we've got a whole bunch.
Of ice, here, and there's a cool way.
We can pop off the top, devin.
We're going to use a plunger, here,
And check this out. here we go, watch.
We go one, two, three.
Devin oh, dear. oh, dear.
That top's going to blow.
Collins it's a sanitized plunger,
Don't you worry.
Instead of just dumping it in,
That'd be too easy, instead we're going to go like this.
A fa la a fa la la la.
Devin you're going to break this. what are you doing.
Collins it's a slight dance, devin.
Devin put it in like that.
Collins all right, we'll get a.
Behind the shoulder yeet yeet.
Devin completely missed. - collins did i get any in.
Devin not even one.
Collins i completely missed. all right, here we go.
We'll dump it all in. bam. ice bucket number one is in.
Devin all right.
Look at this.
Collins holy cow.
Devin it's working.
Collins when did that happen, man.
Devin just now.
As you were dumping all that in there.
All right, my d.i.y. frozen treat is done,
And now it's time to slice off the top of.
My pumpkin in a very cool way.
Collins  not like that.
Devin even cooler than that.
I've got my power washer here,
I've got the pumpkin secure.
And now, it's time to slice off the top.
Collins oh, i almost tripped on my way in.
But i am here right now.
Devin yeah, and tarp the floors.
Collins so, the water power from this.
Is going to be able to slice off.
The top of the pumpkin.
Devin exactly.
Collins click over here to vote.
If you think water will be able to slice.
Off the top the pumpkin.
Devin i think it will.
Collins i don't think so, man.
It's water, bro.
Devin all right, here we go.
Three, two, one. no. it's mostly flying back at me.
Oh, yes.
It's gotten more powerful.
Oh.
It's kind of working.
I think this is going to take a while.
Oh, yes.
It worked.
All right.
Now i just have to clean this thing out.
Collins dude, that was absolutely nuts.
Devin i know, right.
It's my new favorite tool.
Now i'm using a nice method.
To gut this thing.
Collins wait, what is that, devin.
It looks like a portable windmill.
Devin exactly.
It might even blow you away. you ready.
Three, two, one.
Both whoa.
Devin yep, totally worked.
Collins} yeet.
Collins well, as you do that, devin,
Here we go.
I've got a couple substances over here.

Collins no.
Devin no. no mixing.
Collins no.
Devin i'll make sure not to mix.
Collins do not try this at home.
It's hot isomalt.
I'm going to pour into the ice.
It's going to create an insane art piece on the inside.
Three.
Both two.
One.
Collins you better watch out, devin,
I'm coming for the art throne.
Devin all right.
Collins so, now, let's see,
I'm just going to pour this around like this.

Devin now it's time to gut the inside.
Of my pumpkin.
Collins i'm getting splattered with pieces.
Of pumpkin, bro.
Devin yeah.
Collins like, there's seeds flying out--.
Devin it smells real bad now.
Collins three, two, one.
And dip it in like this.
Both ohhhh.
Devin that's so nice.

Like, intermix and mingle in the middle, man.
It's like a little meet and greet.
A little dating app.
Devin i know, right.
Collins here we go,
Last bit of isomalt in in.
Got a whole bunch of hot water here,
And this is the coolest part.
It is time to get out the isomalt art.

Collins all right, here's the big reveal.
Both three, two, one.
Collins yo. - devin whoa.
Collins look at that. - devin whoa.
Collins that's so insane.
Devin that looks absolutely nuts.
Collins look at these pieces, man.
Devin good job.
Collins these are art pieces in and of themselves.
Boom. nailed it.
Devin all right, gotta turn on the helium here.
Collins wait wait wait wait wait wait what.
Devin i'm making an edible balloon.
Collins what.
Devin what am i waiting for.
Collins when did this happen.
Devin what do you mean.
Collins i just look over, you've got.
A dangling green thingy.
Devin exactly.
Collins all right, i'm going to take this.
Right here, i'm going to drop it inside my cube.
You're going to be able to blow up.
A balloon with that.
Devin yes.
Both three, two, one.
Devin let's see if it works.
Both whoa.
Collins turn it off, turn it off, turn it off.
Turn it off, turn it off.
Devin yes.
Look at that. look at that. look at that.
Collins okay, hold on, here's the real question.
Will it float.
Both three, two, one.
Collins oh, my gosh, it's by a string.
Devin oh.
Collins oh.
Both oh.
Collins it's got stuck to the ceiling, though.
It's stuck to the ceiling.
Devin yes. - collins oh, my gosh.
Devin dude. - both yo.
Devin oh, no, it popped.
All right, well, this is going to be.
The inner lining of my gadget.
Collins thing is, this is going to be a tesseract.
I want some alien abilities coming out of this thing.
My tesseract does not fit in this thing,
So we're going to have to get a little bit creative here.
Kind of bop some edges.
All right, we've got the claws here,
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
And now it's time to bust this thing up.
No, dude, you need glasses.
Safety glasses.
Safety first, of course.
Don't try this at home.
Devin safety first.
Collins be very careful there with that.
Careful, collins, careful, close your eyes.
There you go, there you go.
All right, there we go.
Devin we got it. all right. all right.
Collins perfect, thank you.
Devin all right, all right, i need mine now.
I gotta go, very, very safely.
Collins i'll keep my claws pointed down.
Okay, i'll shuffle this way. all right.
Where are they.
Oh, here they are.
Collins can we trade places.
Yes, yes.
Collins i'm going to shuffle this way again.
It's going to slice off the side, a little wa-chink.
What are you doing.
Devin i'm filling up on the inside.
For the inner lining of my gadget.
Collins it doesn't look like.
It's working, devin.
Devin it's not.
Collins three.
Both two, one.
Collins oh. - devin oh, no.
Collins yes. and then, i don't want to break too much.
Of it, but here we go. let's do three, two one-.
Woo hoo hoo. lastly, i've got some.
Agar agar here, i'm going to add in.
It's going to solidify into a cube,
And look just like the tesseract.
Both three, two, one.
Collins i'm just going to pour this in.
Whoa, okay, all right.
So, here we go, just going to pour it in,
Like this, all the way up to the very,
Very tippity top.
Whoa. that was close.
Now i'm going to set this off to the side.
To set, and it's time for the next part of.
My goblin gadget.
All right, next i've got to carefully slice.
My watermelon with a shovel.
You know me, i'm very controlled and very precise.
Devin what. - both three, two, one. yow.
Devin whoopsie.
Collins i missed it. oh my gosh.
All right, we're going to get.
A little side hit on here.
With three, two, one, yow. oh.
Devin well, then.
Collins here we go,
We have the top here.
We're going to grab some wolverine claws,
Again, do not try this at home.
Devin check out this awesome pumpkin carving tool.
Look at this.
It's motorized.
Collins here we go.
It's getting watermelon juice on my pumpkin.
Collins bleah. there we go. nice.
Oh, it's heavy like that.
There we go, man.
At least, time for a plunger, man,
This thing's brand new, fully sanitized,
Here we go, three, two, one.
Let's see, oh. - devin whoa.
What are you doing.
Collins i gotta plunge the inside.
-why. why, though.
Of it, man, that's how you fully.
Clean it out, man. because this is.
How you do it, man.
Devin i'm just going to continue back over here.
Collins i think, all in all,
My watermelon's pretty nicely cleared.
Oh, no. i ripped a whole in the side of it.
Devin that's what you're concerned about.
Not the fact that your entire melon is all over our counter.
Collins you know, i think we're.
Going to have to start all over with.
A brand new melon and go.
A little more carefully like you've done, devin.
All right, we've got all the elements,
Time to put together our green goblin gadget.
I've got my tesseract here, it's been fully set.
But i gotta say, man, this is a lot more giggly.
Than i expected it to be.
Devin this stuff looks so delicious.
Collins what is that.
Devin this is my d.i.y. yogurt.
Collins oh, so you're going to put that on the inside.
I take my tesseract, and i've got to.
Be very quick with this,
I'm going to flip it upside down.
So, oh, my gosh.
Looks like play-dough, almost, man.
Devin exteme concentration going on.
Over here, all right.
Collins this thing is so much heavier than i expected.
So, here we go, i gotta do this very carefully.
Three, two, one. wa-boom. - devin did it work.
Both three, two, one.
Collins i'm going to lift it off,
You can hear it, i can hear it coming off.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
-oh.
Okay, bam.
No.
I don't like you.
This almost ruined it all, man.
Devin wow.
I have mycelium husk slime, here.
Wait, wait, wait, let me see if it--.
Both whoa.
Devin i'm starting to add it. yes.
Collins holy cow.
All right, so here we go.
So, we got the watermelon,
We're going to place this right here.
We've got to get the tesseract up.
And inside of it, so here we go.
Oh, man, it is,
It feels so weird.
All right, let's see.
Let's lift it up like this.
Oh, it's falling apart, falling apart,
Here we go, drip it in, drip it in.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Devin you broke the tesseract, man.
Collins i didn't break it devin, it all.
Went according to plan. it just happened to,
We're just going to pick up the pieces.
And put them in.
I gotta say, i was hoping it would stay.
In a square shape, it didn't.
So, here we go. spun honey is going to go in,
Around the top.
All right, we've got all the elements,
Now it's time to compile them.
Put them together, add the finishing touches,
And make these things look incredible.
We've got the finished goblin gadgets,
And these things turned out absolutely--.
I know, right.
Insane, man. i mean, like yours is so cool,
I gotta say devin was very kind.
He helped me out with a couple different elements of mine.
Yes.
So, here is the big reveal. you ready.
Both three, two, one. ta-da.
Collins yes. - devin what.
Dude, i cannot wait to throw these off of a balcony.
Collins so, you get to comment down below.
Which one is going to look cooler when we throw.
It off the top of the balcony and.
Do the drop test. we'll be doing that.
At the end of the video.
Now, we're making captain america shields.
And i'm kicking mine off with a bang.
Both three, two, one.
Collins it's in.
Both.
Devin wait, how are you catching this.
Collins oh, no.
Dude.
I'm trying to-.
What are you doing.
Here we go, there we go, here we go.
And then we just pour it in.
What are you doing. is that it.
Collins all things considered, that went.
A lot better than it could've.
Devin are you kidding.
For the first layer of my captain america shield.
I'm pouring hot isomalt on this exercise ball.
I've got a super-cool way of painting my shield.
Are you ready for this.
Collins so, you're going to put the paints on.
Devin yes, i made some edible paint right here.
And then you just put it down, boom.
Whoa. - look at that.
Collins that is, like, mesmerizing, man.
Devin i know, right.
I'm going to reinforce my shield with some coconut.
Collins and i've got a giant whisk here.
Because i am whisk-man.
Check it out. bam.
Devin nothing's more solid than coconut.
Collins oh. - devin what did you hit.
Collins nothing.
What are you doing.
Devin i'm making a coconut blancmange.
To reinforce my shield.
Collins ah, yes, nothing like a little coconut blanc-.
Blancmange.
Blancwonge--.
I don't even know how to spell it.
Collins all right, well, here we go.
You do that. time for me to.
Whisk around my aquafaba right here,
What are you doing.
Devin i bet you're jealous.
Collins of what.
My liquid nitrogen.
All right, time to remove my coconuts.
Collins and i'm adding in a whole bunch.
Of agar agar, and this is going to make mine.
Really thick.
Devin look. - collins holy cow.
What is going on.
Now is time to smash it.
Wait, wait, with a hammer.
What.
All right, here we go--.
Both three, two,
Collins wait, wait, wait.
Three second like challenge.
We want to see if you can like this video in three seconds.
You ready. here we go.
Both three, two, one. done.
Three, two, one. oh.
Oh.
Devin wow.
Collins look at the inside.
Devin look at that.
Collins i have never seen a coconut.
Filled this much, man.
I'm covered in coconut juice.
Devin serves you right.
Collins it's delicious.
Devin now that i froze everything.
I have to unfreeze it inside this pan.
Collins dude look at this.
The agar agars coming together.
Man, look at it bro.
Devin oh i can smell coconut already.
Collins i just had an idea bro.
What if we make aquafaba bubbles dude.
All right here we go, just going to pour in.
Some of the juice right now.
We're going to strain it out, lets see like this.
Check this out and this is what's going to get really crazy.
Gonna open up a tank of helium right now.
And its going to infuse all the aquafaba juice.
And who knows what's going to happen next so here we go.
You ready.
Both three, two, one. - collins yoooo.
Devin what. dude.
Collins oh here's the question though.
Because of the bubbles,
Devin yes.
Collins is there any way of actually making it.
Float in the air, do you think.
Devin oh wait, yes. and be very careful.
Collins yeah yeah.
Devin do not try this at home.
Collins exactly.
Devin here we go. three.
Both two, one. yooo.
Oh, no, no.
Collins get it off the ceiling. get it off the ceiling.
Get it off the ceiling. get it off the ceiling bro.
Devin try it again. try it again. try it again.
Collins oh my god, it's like dripping all this juice.
Dude it floated up perfectly man.
Devin that was awesome.
Collins yo, wait, wait, wait, i have an idea bro.
What if i actually just dunk on it.
Devin three, two, one.
There you go. there you go.
Devin i think you totally missed.
Collins the way that the bubbles are going, i think it.
I think it worked.
Devin dude, one of the mic things fell off.
Collins how did that get there.
All right well we gotta, oh boy that's a.
That's gonna be an issue.
This took quite awhile but i made some puffed rice over here.
And i made it in the ginger ale that i used earlier.
See there was a purpose for it devin.
Devin yeah well, i've been mixing around.
This agar agar stuff for a while.
So now it's time to grab the isomalt.
Collins it's gotta be very carefully done.
Devin yooo. that looks so incredile.
Collins very carefully.
Devin so now i need to do this one-handed.
Cause i got the silver leaf on the bottom.
Collins do you want me to help you out with this at all.
Devin no, please don't.
Collins i mean, it makes sense.
As you do that, i'm gonna strain out my rice over here.
Devin all right.
So here we are, just gonna dump it in here like this.
Devin my shield is gonna be extra reinforced now.
Collins all right let's see if you can waffle rice.
Here we go. gonna add the puff rice in.
Devin i'm risking it all for this reinforcement.
Collins yeah, you're really gonna need it man.
Cause if you can get this and your shield will not break.
When i punch it with my fist.
Devin exactly.
Collins here we go.
Gonna open this up on the count of three.
Three.
Both two, one. yooooo.
Collins i've got the aquafabo.
Now it's time to add in a whole bunch of my puffed rice.
Right now it's gonna dry out.
And turn into the base of my shield.
Devin we've don't a lot with liquid nitrogen.
But we've never filled up a water blaster with it.
Collins a what.
Hold on.
Devin i gotta spray it on my --.
Collins all right now.
Devin to get them cold and remember.
Do not try this at home.
Collins yes. don't try this at home.
Oh my gosh.
Devin three, two, one.
Both oh.
Devin it didn't work.
Collins did it go.
Devin no. you can tell it's in here though.
I lost my balloon, sorry i got it.
Devin okay.
Collins i lost my balloon.
Devin well, that really did not work.
So i guess i'm gonna have to try something else.
Can you please hold this in place for me.
For a second devin.
Devin place them in here. what.
Collins can you please hold this in place for me.
For a second. so here we go.
Devin yeah sure. yeah yeah. oh, oh. dude. what.
Are you kidding.
Collins i'm sorry.
Collins can you just grab my balloon for me.
Over here we've got my puff rising aquafaba.
So time to actually add this on to the balloon.
And use the balloon--.
Devin here you go. catch.
Collins gonna use the balloon as the mold.
And the base of my shield.
I think the chunk will actually be able to weigh it down.
All right, so here we go.
Next up, just gonna grab the uh--.
No.
Devin what happened.
Ah. i lost it.
It flipped off and collected a whole bunch of peanuts man.
Devin all right i got it.
Collins thank you.
Devin here you go. here you go.
Sorry.
Collins holy cow.
Next up, we gotta grab some red right over here.
So here we go.
How's yours coming along.
Devin it's coming along pretty good.
It's pretty not blended up at all.
I have to blend this more.
All right the final step is to place down this screen here.
Collins is that from a screen window, devin.
Dan's gonna be not happy about that.
Devin my shield is way more important than our window.
Now i'm gonna squeegee it around.
Collins that's not how you use a squeegee man.
I guess that's a creative way of using a squeegee.
Devin it's true. it's not how you traditionally use it.
Collins time to combine all the elements.
And make this into a true edible captain america shield.
That will blow your mind.
We've got the finished captain america shield.
Devin yup.
Collins so here's the big reveal. you ready.
Here we go.
Both three, two, one. ta-da.
Collins look at these things bro.
They turned out so brazy man.
This is amazing.
Collins so much work it took to get these.
So you get to comment down below whose shield.
You think turned out better.
And which one is going to taste better.
We spent a long time on these.
We will be trying them at the end of the video.
And stick around to see us throw.
The green goblet gadgets off the balcony.
You challenged us to make edible infinity gauntlets.
We could actually wear. so right now let's go.
Collins i'm kicking off by making some crunchy honey.
With honey and liquid nitrogen.
What are you making devin.
Devin i'm making japanese jelly with agar-agar,
Stevia, and water.
That looks like some weird underwater aqua planet.
Devin all right, now it's time to put the jelly.
On to the subwoofer.
It's going on the top, dude.
This is how i'm going to mix my color.
Collins all right, so here's the deal.
Gotta kinda move my honey around.
Just like the liquid nitrogen.
Try to get all parts of it frozen right now. here we go.
Next up, we're gonna pull out this thingy here.
So here we go.
Devin it's a strainer. that's what it's called.
Collins let's see if i can hook it on the bottom.
What.
Devin that is crazy.
Collins holy cow.
Whoa.
Collins oh. it just fell a part.
Devin that is some crunchy honey.
Now it's time to turn on my speaker.
Three, two, one.
There we go. oh, oh, oh, oh.
Collins that feels like an alien right there.
Like an alien that would happen in marvel.
Devin i have to now put on some food coloring.
You might want to step back, so you don't turn purple.
All right.
Collins okay, yup. i'm going to uh--.
Devin here we go, here we go.
I don't know where to go.
Devin here we go.
I don't know where to go.
Devin three, two, one.
All right, it's doing kinda--.
Oh no. it's all over the table.
All right dude. i think it totally worked. yes.
Collins that's a life hack i never thought i would see.
As you're doing that, i'm just gonna keep.
Pounding this up into little pieces.
Devin now it's time to add some blue.
Right in here like this.
Whoa. look at that.
Oh my gosh.
Collins i'm blown away by this.
Devin wow.
Now i'm going to add some green in here like this.
Collins it looks kinda like slime.
Devin that stuff flies everywhere.
Collins yeah it's like projectile man.
Next up, we've got some stones over here.
I'm gonna use these stones to place in the mold.
To act as the infinity stone.
Three, two, one.
Look at that bro.
So here we go, just place it in the palm of my hand.
Devin yeah, go, go, go.
Yes dude. okay.
Fist bump, devin.
Devin wait, wait, no, no, no.
Fist bump.
Devin your aim is terrible.
Collins but my fist bumps are great.
Both three, two, one. no.
Collins to get devin back, it's very easy.
So here's how this works.
I'm just gonna twist the space stone.
It'll make a portal right here and devin will appear.
So here we are. three, two, one.
Yo.
Devin you couldn't have made that wider dude.
I'm sorry bro. it's a space stone. okay.
Devin the things you do to me on this channel.
At least you get to see mayo man, right.
Devin i went to like 5 different dimensions.
All right, it's out and there you go.
Collins wait, so that's gonna be your infinity stones.
Yeah and you know what's next.
Liquid nitrogen.
Collins whoa.
Devin all right. time for some liquid nitrogen.
Okay, pour it right on top.
Collins like a direct pour on top.
Wait, why you blowing on it.
Devin cause it's so cool.
Cause it's a lot of suds.
Devin three.
Holy cow.
Devin two.
One.
Have you started yet.
Devin now i have. now i have.
Oh. it's like a cloud but yet.
It's liquid at the same time.
Devin wow.
It's so tough to tell where the liquid is.
Devin definitely do not try this at home.
All right, now it's time to break it up.
Into the infinity stones.
Collins oh man. here we go.
Both three.
Two.
Collins oh. i just had an idea.
What if you pick it up and then you just smash it.
Oh, yes.
Collins all right let's see this.
Devin trying to pick it up with these massive gloves.
I wonder if it's gonna break or not.
Do you need help. kinda like--.
Devin i think i got it. i got it. i got it.
Ready here we go.
Both three.
Two.
One.
Oh.
Devin i think this kinda beat yours already man.
Collins i don't know.
Devin my infinity gauntlet.
I've got the silicon mold right here.
I'm gonna dust it with 24k gold.
Oh, look at this. it's a gold peach.
Collins you're gonna take a dusted peach.
And peach fuzz all over it.
Exactly.
Collins and place it in there.

And do something very gentle with the strawberries.
Sure.
Collins bam. juiced on me.
O-k, that is terrifying.
Oh man, okay, all right.

Collins that is how you juice up some strawberries.
Devin whisking is done.
Now it's time to fill up my mold.
I got it, i got it, look at that.
All right, i only have to fill up one half.
Because i'm gonna use some triphical force.
To fill up the other half.
And i'm using a tri-cycle.
Collins i still think--.
A tricycle.
Yes.
Collins that is one wheel of a tricycle's got 3 wheels.
Oh yeah, yeah, a unicycle.
Collins you don't know your basic bike wheels.
Our strawberries is stuck in this middle portion.
Of the sock. so here we go we're gonna go here.
It's gonna get like squeezes around.
Devin i'm gonna use some triphical force to coat.
The inside of the mold.
Collins but first devin, you must ride it.
To show that you are worthy of using a unicycle.
Here we go.
Collins do you even know how to ride a unicycle.
I do not. i got it.
Collins you got it.
You're like slipping backwards though.
I'm riding it. look at this. amazingness.
Collins i gotta say don't try this at-.
Devin no hands. no hands. wow.
Holy cow. he's riding it. okay that's enough.
Devin that is enough. holy cow.
I did it. i did it. all right.
Devin just rode a unicycle for the first time.
I learned it.
Now i just have to attach this to the unicycle pedal.
With a carrot. - not with a carrot.
You sure. - put the carrots away.
I will not. - you don't need them.
Not only does he do all of his own stunts,
He does his own sound effects.
Yeet.
Gotta put it up like this here, looks like this.
Your unicycle in my face, devin.
And then, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Yoooooo.
Here we go. - that is crazy.
And now it's going to coat every side of the mold.
Time for me to construct the infinity gauntlet.
Around my hand.
Whoa.
We gotta knead the dough.
I'm making some edible accents for my gauntlet.
Pouring the water in.
Then i have to whisk it super, super quick.
I gotta get it out. i gotta get it out.
Wait its gonna fall out the bottom though.
Look, look.
Wait so it's going to turn into noodles then or what.
Moment of truth.
Go for it.

I think i should pull off some of the fingers here.
I'm going for the red stone.
I'll take as many of the stones as i possibly can.
Here we go, infinity knuckles.
Oh wait, perfect, here we go.
Three, two one.
Whoa, woo.
Whoa, dude, these are like solid on the outside.
And nice and creamy on the inside.
Wow. so good.
Very nice.
I don't know if mines gonna be able to live up to that.
I'll take the ring finger here, oh look at it.
Devin i'll take a nice pinky.
Three, two, one.
Wow, that is crunchy.
Very unpleasant experience.
Yeah i gotta say the stone combined with the cucumber.
Was definitely very bizarre.
Yes.
But you get to comment down below.
Which one would you like to eat if you had the choice.
And right now, we're onto the next one.
Got the edible captain america shield,
Which one do you think is gonna taste better.
I think mine will, i think it's more unique.
Let's taste yours first then we can taste mine.
Which part of it do you want to eat first.
I wanna eat the star and the outer edge.
Collins that's your piece of the star.
Thank you, appreciate it.
Three, two, one.
The star is so brittle.
Despite the burnt-ness.
It's actually quite tasty.
Now it's time to try mine after that catastrophe.
Catastrophe. - yes.
I mean hey it was like decent.
How are we going about eating yours, devin.
With the chisel.
This is for you, be very careful.
This just looks like a chunk of ice.
Gotta get some of this cardboard stuff under here.
And there you go.
Oh man, i don't want to eat some of the cardboard.
Get a nice chunk.
Three, two, one.
Talk about crunchy.
This paper stuff tastes terrible.
It tasted just like cardboard so.
Devin yeah neither of these were really a home run.
You get to comment down below.
Which one do you think will be able to withstand a punch.
And right now we're onto the next one.
We've got the giant edible green goblin gadgets.
Yep.
And now it's time to throw these things down.
On the bullseye.
We're looking for the biggest explosion possible.
Which one should we test out first.
I think we should test out yours first.
Devin how about you hop down there right now,
I'm gonna prepare it, the toss  this is heavy.
That's a weak toss dude,
Last time you chucked it really hard.
Excuse me i'm preparing, go downstairs.
All right, all right, sure.
Prepare to give this thing a big drop.
Power stance, right just power stance and then drop it.
Yes, exactly, you're good at the power stance.
On a scale from one to 10,
How big do you think the impact is going to be.
Oh geez, i think probably a solid seven.
Mine's going to be way bigger let's face it.
Yeah but see the thing is devin,
Bigger isn't always better.
Sometimes good things come in small packages.
Whoa.
In this case, green goblin gadget.
Here we go.
Three, two, one.
Devin oh my gosh.
Collins what did i tell you dude.
Holy cow, i think that was a 10 bro.
I don't know, yours is so gelatinous,
Mine's gonna splatter everywhere.
I don't know man, so you ready to challenge mine.
Yeah, i guess we'll find out.
All right let's switch spots.
Got my pumpkin green goblin gadget.
And i'm ready to do the drop dude.
I don't think you are devin,
I don't think you understand what it takes.
To smash the pumpkin.
What do you mean. mine's going to go everywhere.
It's got the dry ice frozen yogurt.
But what you're forgetting is you have a balloon inside.
Of your pumpkin.
Balloons ae soft, they float,
It's not gonna hit the ground with any force.
It's getting dark and mine has glow in the dark slime so.
Yeah that is kinda cool actually.
Yeah but on a scale of one to 10,
How far do you think its gonna go.
I don't know, i feel like it's either gonna be like a two.
Or an 11.
What.
I don't know it's either gonna go everywhere.
Or it's just gonna hit and not do anything.
How does a two even make it in there.
I just don't know if it's gonna be-.
It's gonna be 11 for sure, you ready for this.
I don't know if you have the ability to.
Smash the pumpkin, that's all i'm saying.
So you're stound to my ability.
