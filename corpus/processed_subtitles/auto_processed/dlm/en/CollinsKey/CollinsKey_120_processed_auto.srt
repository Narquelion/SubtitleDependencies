What's up guys.
It's collins.
Now, halloween is right around the corner.
And if you guys are like me.
You probably procrastinate on your costumes.
Today you're in luck because i'm gonna be.
Doing some last minute halloween costumes.
To help me out, i have a friend of mine.
The beautiful meg de angeles.
Hey.
Hey.
Welcome.
Thanks, hi.
And i decided to turn this into a challenge.
Woo.
Here i have a giant pile of clothes,
Random costume stuff,
We've even given some categories.
Like pirates, medieval.
And then in 30 seconds,
Using the random pile of clothes.
We get to try and make that costume,
Super last minute.
Let's get started.
That was , that was awkward.
Back in black,
That's a maddie right there,
That's a last minute halloween costume.
I think it's like a better base.
For all the cool costumes we're gonna be putting on.
She knows a lot about this.
I'm gonna go with her opinion on it.
The first category is.
Fairies.
Go.
I think i have a wand stuck to my butt.
All right, that's time.
Dang it.
If you can tell i have the magical fairy wand.
I went with the tutu.
Because i wanted to be an ultra-masculine fairy.
I'm good, i'm done here.
He spends his life dressing up as a girl fairy pretty much.
But.
Come back from the corner.
Oh a man crying in the corner.
My fairy friends, petunia and patricia.
This is my fairy outfit.
So i am a fairly of the underworld.
And then this is the gem to get into my fairy caves,
Scan it to get in.
Wow.
There's only six of them in the whole world.
Wow.
Yes, and then-.
That's a lot of backstory for the one gem.
This is my wand,
I'm like deep and dark.
And i'm also a bit hipster.
So instead of wands, i go with flowers,
And then i have these sparkling wings on me,
They're just for funzees, they don't even work.
I think it's pretty apparent who won this one.
I'm like kanye west with this quilt on right now.
All right guys, so,
And now i'm a dirty fairy.
Let us know in the comment.
Who do you guys think won.
This last-minute halloween costume.
I mean, it was me but you know.
We are going to be doing hippies.
One, two, three, go.
I need more suspenders.
Dude, you're gonna end up looking like a clown.
Four, three,
What am i doing here.
There's nothing. two.
Oh here. that's just one, okay.
Dang it, i made a bib.
That was not meant to happen.
Like this video if you guys think.
That meg looks beautiful right now.
Because those glasses are on point.
So i have this, it looks like a bow.
But really it's a hippie band.
The bow represents happiness.
This, you may think it's a bib,
But really it is a very fashionable top.
Mm.
And then we have this which is like,
It's more like a cape.
Oh.
It's kind of like a cape style.
How about yours.
The hair, of course, is the most important part.
Because that's what everyone sees.
I have a little bit of a hair extension over here.
I have these suspenders on,
I don't really know how to put suspenders on,
It's also some nice resistance training.
When you're at concerts,
You can get just work your triceps.
I'm a hippie guy so i'm very in touch.
With my feminine side.
And so i like to wear skirts and dresses.
To signify the feminism in all of us.
You like wearing skirts,
This is the second outfit with a skirt.
The first one was a tutu.
In the comment down below,
And let us know who won the hippie outfit.
I think you might've taken this one home.
Oh my god, what is this.
It's like elmo threw up on my hair.
On the next category,
We'll see if he chooses another skirt outfit,
But it's gonna be,
Okay, you're in for it.
Vampire.
Cool.
Oh my god. vampire teeth.
Clear advantage.
Oh you got that.
Did you say claire danes.
I said clear.
I was like, "what.".
I said, "clear advantage.".
These are, these are, these are,
These are a cross,
I know what these are,
These are the flood gates.
You're gonna have trouble speaking throughout this one.
But that's okay, i'll translate.
Cool.
So guys.
He says my outfit sucks.
No, he didn't do it.
Screw that.
But it is an authentic vampires hat.
I wanna keep it modern and i put on this vest.
Because it looks like something.
That a vampire would wear now to kind of fit in.
These roses actually signify.
That i am fourth level warlock vampire.
Of the seventh degree.
If i just show this rose to people.
And they bow down, so.
Well, i-.
And she's not in my clan.
I'm.
She's like, "i'm not gonna bow down.".
Oh .
Thank you.
This is an eight level warlock clan, you see.
Not to be too mainstream here.
But vampires will always have the cape.
If i'm too tired to suck my own blood,
Okay, i have my friend petunia to suck the blood for me.
I hate losing so bad that every single.
