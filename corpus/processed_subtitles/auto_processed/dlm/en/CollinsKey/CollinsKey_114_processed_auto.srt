Collin we've got real food versus slime food.
Whoa.
You challenged us to turn real food into slime food.
So right now, we're kicking it off.
Obviously with cereal.
Yup, i think i spilled just a little bit.
Glue.
Ew.
You just got it everywhere.
Yo, i think i messed up.
I added so much sta-flow at once.
Ah, i just blasted it all over the table.
Mine looks like an alien mucus.
And then there's this.
Eww.
Well, i'm gonna add some into yours.
No.
Get your sta-flow out my bowl.
Oh, dude this is crazy.
I know, it is really weird.
Whee.
Just in case it wasn't obvious.
This right here is going to be the milk.
I totally meant to do that.
My arms are hurting.
Oh, yeah.
Slime is a gucci good time.
Oh yeah, mines perfect.
Dude, it's not even sticking to my hand anymore.
Really.
I can go, whee.
That didn't happen.
Wait, we're connected.
No, get off me.
Stop it.
Why is yours dripping all over me.
You got it all over the chair.
Bro, are you kidding me.
How did i end up with your slime.
Are you kidding me.
What is wrong with your slime.
Where did my slime go, what the heck.
Bro, this is game over.
We haven't even made the milk yet.
My arms are so tired.
I have double slime.
We're gonna take a quick break right now.
Come back, because we gotta clean up, man.
What the heck happened.
This is what happens when you don't make slime for months.
You lose your ability, and you ruin everything.
I've got new pants.
We've ruined the chairs.
But right now, we're gonna persevere.
Is it good to go.
Yeah, it's good to go.
We added some sta-flow.
We're gonna split it in half.
Wait, bro.
Okay, here we go.
Put it into the bowl, devin.
Next up, we add these balls, and these smaller balls.
Dude, i'm totally gonna win this round.
Because there's no way you can compete with me on this.
And, done.
No you're not.
Yeah, i'm done.
Oh, all right, cool.
See guys, sometimes the greatness takes a little bit longer.
Than just mediocre averagness.
Mediocre averageness.
What are you talking about.
This is a perfect replica, of this.
Dude, it's actually turning into crunchy slime.
Dude, i don't recommend that at all, but go for it.
It's going inside.
That's enough, i'm gonna break it off there.
Get off my hand.
I'm just gonna squish it around in there.
Oh man, that perfect.
And then, now to get it out.
You just tear the bag open like this.
It's pretty genius.
Thanks.
Now it's time to add my milk with infused cereal.
So we're gonna swirl it around.
Bad idea, we're just gonna.
All right, now for the main ingredient.
I got a technique for this.
It's called, the light shake and shimmy.
I'm gonna squeeze it.
It looks fine.
Oh yeah, this is gonna be legit.
Because now my cereal is going to be unlike your cereal.
You gotta admit bro, this stuff is pretty awesome.
Look at that.
Whoo.
Yo, that looks crazy.
Now you gotta give it the one final technique.
I call it, the once around the club.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
There we go.
See, it's like a fashion statement on my arm.
It's called, the drop and plop.
Devin intercept.
I'm sorry man, i just wanted to play with this.
Crunchy slime is so awesome.
Whoa bro, what are you doing.
No, get your fingers out of there.
I think it's time to call it quits.
I've done just about all i can do with it.
Now it's time to add the spoon.
You get to comment down below.
And let us know who won, round one.
Was it my beautiful cereal, with all the infused goodness.
Or was it devin's.
That looks so awesome.
Now we have the bowl of slime.
So what we're gonna do devin, is add a little bit of yours.
A little bit of it.
Yep.
Whoa, bro.
What are you doing.
I gotta sever it with my spoon.
Bro, why.
Here's what's gonna happen.
We're gonna add a little bit of the real food as well.
Wait, why.
Bro, that's so gross.
Because, at the end of this.
We're gonna mix together, all the different slimes.
All the different foods.
And then we're gonna have to eat it.
And see what it tastes like.
Eat it.
For this round.
You challenges us to make a starbucks frappuccino.
Out of slime.
Oh man.
My hands are not strong enough for this.
Well, leave some for me bro.
Then, we got contact solution.
Because that's how you make the clear slime.
If you guys don't remember.
This is gonna act as the strawberry base.
To the whole thing.
I'm starting to get a little slime.
That would be a funny name for a rapper, lil slime.
Oh yeah, we're starting to get there.
I need more contact solution.
It stuck to my arm.
Why would you do that.
I'm dripping it.
No, no, no.
Now what we're gonna do.
Is we're gonna add some food coloring into the game.
Because if it isn't working now.
It surely isn't going to work when we add food coloring.
I'll add some to yours.
It's all over me.
We're just gonna mix it around.
That turned real crimson, real quick.
That actually looks-.
Whoo, this looks legit.
Like raspberry or strawberry marmalade.
We got that, now it's time to make my regular slime.
We got some glue.
Now, i'm gonna add the sta-flo.
I forgot rule number one.
You're not supposed to add the sta-flo too quickly.
Whoopsie.
All right, this is going great.
Look how much sta-flo i added.
It's a sta-flo soup.
This is still not looking like it's gonna cut it.
So i'm gonna make this, some fluffy slime.
That's so smart.
I need this to look fluffy and nice and frappuccinie.
Instead, it looks like a giant booger.
Shaving cream.
It's a cloud.
My favorite slime.
Dude, listen to the sound of this.
It's no longer all stringy and gross.
I've done the impossible.
I've made a full recovery.
And i'm doing just dandy.
Now i'm gonna add some acrylic paint.
So first, you gotta karate chop it, to get it open.
Bro.
So fluffy.
That looks so good.
Wait, how did you get a new bowl.
Magic.
You smack the slime.
Yeah, smack it three times.
Now we're gonna dump some of my acrylic paint in here.
Dude, this acrylic paint looks insane.
Oh dude, it got on my fingers.
Holy cow, this stuff smells disgusting.
Devin but, it looks like candy.
Yeah.
Devin this is so cool.
What happened to my beautiful slime.
My hands are ruined.
Dude, it's ruined my slime.
I think it deconstructed my slime.
All right, first layer is done.
Next up, adding the fluffy slime.
I just smacked my face.
I'm overflowing, no.
This is my moment.
Whoa, that looks so cool.
Look at this.
Ew.
Too much slime, i gotta cut it off.
I'm gonna do it like this, my final layer.
I gotta go wash my hands because they're literally pink.
And it will contaminate the rest of my drink.
See, if i touch it like that-.
No, no, no.
Dude, why.
It turns pink, so i gotta go wash my hands.
It was perfect.
I actually have a little bit of a different technique.
For blasting my whip cream onto my drink, you ready.
Three.
Two.
No, no, no.
Wait, first we have a five second subscribe challenge.
For you right now.
Can you subscribe to this channel.
And turn on the post notifications, in five seconds.
Here we go, you ready.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.

Done.
If you could do that.
Comment down below, keyper squad, right now.
Here we go.
Three, two, one.
Really, that was it.
Whoa, bro.
Chill.
Dude, you're getting it everywhere, it's too much.
Done, boom.
It's on top.
Whoo, that's fantastic.
Dude, it's like a little dragon.
All right, you gotta pop the top.
Pop the what.
Pop the top.
It's a goner.
Really, dude.
Got it back.
All right, here we go.
Crunch it.
Devin i love the sound effects, to be honest.
Pop the top.
Oh dude, look at that.
This is now my finished product.
I gotta go around the edges, scoop it all up.
Here we go, top it off.
Devin  whoa.
I mean, is that not awesome.
Oh my gosh, i've automatically won this round.
You can just comment down below right now.
Collin's won the round.
I know.
I want to do that again.
That was so much fun.
That's so cool.
Do not vote on what it looks like currently.
You're only voting on the very cool action.
Of the whipped cream popping out the top.
That's all you're able to vote on, with my drink.
I'm trying not to have the same thing happen to me.
That happened to you.
Devin the finishing touch, the straw.
Perfect.
Off with the top, and in with the hand.
And that's how you drink a frappuccino.
Now we're gonna add it to the bowl of slime and food.
So, we added mine in there.
Lets just add the whole cup in there.
And again, at the end.
We're going to be eating a combination of slime and food.
So stick around for that.
Right now, we are on to the next round.
Egg smashing contest in three, two, one.
Wait dude, no way bro.
I was totally joking about that.
You guys challenged us to make a slime egg.
First up, we gotta crack our egg.
So, we're recreating this.
Whoever finished their slime first, wins.
This is not about good or bad.
Begin.
It's pretty bubbly, bro.
I don't know what happened.
This is looking pretty-.
You good.
No.
It looks like a clear liquid glass.
It might not be perfect.
But we're going for the fastest round of all time.
Remember devin, it's all about who makes it first.
Get off my hands.
Boom.
There's two ways to make the yolk.
You can either use the clay.
Or you can legit, take the yolk from the actual egg.
This is for the winning move.
Yeah.
There you have it devin, an egg of slime.
Or a slime of egg.
An egg slime.
All right, so i won this round.
But you guys can still comment down below.
Who you think won.
But, i took home the victory.
You could put a couple egg shells by them.
Like i just cracked it open.
We gotta take the big ole thing of slime.
I'm gonna pop an egg shell in there.
And then i'm gonna mix up the yolk.
Into my slime, to see what happens.
No.
Wait, first we got a three second, like challenge.
Can you like this video, in three seconds.
Here we go, you ready.
Three.
Two.
One.
Done.
Devin that is so gross.
That looks crazy.
This is now, literally slime mixed with food.
Look at that.
I feel queasy.
That's pretty gross.
After this next round.
We're gonna be mixing all of this up.
And literally eating it.
Don't do it at home.
We're doing it, so you don't have to.
Pie face challenge.
No.
You can't play with my heart like that.
Okay, for this final round.
We are making a slime pie.
We're definitely gonna need a lot, a lot of slime.
To be able to build the entire pie crust.
Let me leave that there for right now.
Gotta unscrew the top.
Yey.
There's always gotta be one in the video.
Yeah, it took you a long time, i'm really surprised.
I know, people were probably waiting for it.
Like, "when's it gonna happen.".
We're gonna add a little bit in.
Nice, that looks like a lot, too much.
Bro, are you trying to ruin it on purpose.
No, you just have to evenly proportion it, man.
Proportion.
What are we, amateur beatboxers.
I think you're spitting all over everything right now.
This reminds me of the liquid water bottle.
But one that you can not eat.
This is not edible at all.
I think my slime is officially ruined.
Oh, why.
It's very thick and resilient.
I can't tell if this is a blueberry pie.
Or a raspberry pie.
I have a great idea, devin.
I'm gonna put this in the middle, and then close it in here.
And see if i can break it.
No.
Holy cow, how did that happen.
I legit, did it.
Okay, okay.
No, it's on my thumb.
It's like little injections of color.
Whoa, that's super neat.
It's like a mushroom.
Some part is super dense purple.
And then other parts haven't purpleized at all.
Purpleized.
Purpleized.
I like that word.
Oh no, i got it on my pinky.
Mayday, mayday.
No, it's all over my hands.
Gotta go for it.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
Oh, no.
It burst on my hands.
Well, there you have-.
This is never gonna come out.
I'm gonna go for a second.
I gotta go wash my hands, bye.
Bro, this is looking so cool.
It looks almost like a galaxy.
I'm gonna use a spoon, so i don't ruin my hands again.
It looks kind of lumpy, chunky and funky, man.
You take a bunch of this stuff.
And you cut little strips of it.
And then you lay it over, in this pattern.
So, you make it look like that.
Dude, you do not use a knife in your hand.
I can't believe i'm the one telling you this.
But you do not cut something when it's in your hand.
Sorry.
I'm just rolling this thing out, real nice.
Lets get saucy, up in this place.
The first strip.
Oh, it broke.
Dude, that's a metal knife of glass.
I can literally hear that scratching the table, devin.
There, you have my pie.
It's like a little cobra coming out the top of it.
Well, i'm done.
I've just begun.
As with everything, let the time lapse begin.
Here it is, the big reveal.
This was suggested by the instagram keyper of the week.
So shout out to you.
And if you want to be shouted out.
As the instagram keyper of the week.
Check the description down below, to find out how.
Right now, the big reveal, you ready.
Three, two, one.
Tada.
Bro, this turned out so good.
You guys get to comment down below, for this final round.
Who won.
Now it's time to add this to.
The ultimate slime food versus real food.
And then eat it.
Right now, lets see how they taste.
Whoa.
That's crazy.
Now, lets try it with this.
What.
No, what.
I shouldn't have done that.
No.
Pie in.
Pie in.
Now we're gonna mix it all up.
Whoa.
What happened to the starbucks.
We gotta get that cup out of there.
Oh, that's so gross.
This is the craziest combination of stuff, ever.
Whoo, it smells.
I smell the starbucks, and that actually smells delicious.
It actually kind of looks cool, but it's kind of gross.
It's all super cold, because the starbucks was cold.
There's an egg in here too, i forgot about that.
Comment down below.
What are some other real foods.
We should make slime versions of.
And comment down below, of course.
Who won the challenge, overall.
Here we go, time to eat it.
Whoa, whoa, bro, bro, bro, i have to say.
I'm smelling this paint and it's really gross.
And this is actual slime and glue, and sta-flo.
I'm pretty sure this is not good for you, dude.
I don't think we should eat this.
You know what, you're probably right.
You guys should not eat slime.
And i guess i shouldn't either.
I forgot, there's acrylic paint in here.
It's all pretty toxic.
So just take one last beautiful look at it.
And remember, safety, is of course, the first priority here.
So don't eat slime at home.
I guess i won't eat slime either.
It did look pretty tasty.
But it's definitely very bad for you.
