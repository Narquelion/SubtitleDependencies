Let's rewind the clock a couple years.
When young naive innocent logan is in.
The sixth grade our our school had a.
Camping trip called mohican and we were.
There for like five days so you know we.
Hiked we would build fires we throw.
Tomahawks we found out that one of my.
Friends had a problem wetting the bed.
Which was kind of weird but it was.
Sucked even more for me because i was in.
The bunk underneath him anyways this.
Place was all about self-discovery.
Now there was this one kid in our grade.
Who was a bit different and i don't mean.
Different like he was the quiet kid who.
Played the oboe i mean different like he.
Would pretend to be a dragon and run.
Around screeching at people before.
School started yeah that's exactly what.
It sounded like so this kid let's call.
Him carlo he was a bigger kid right and.
He was known to actually beat people up.
In the bathroom so anyways every night.
At camp bunk 13 carl would stay up all.
Night he would not sleep and what's more.
He was very he was very vocal about it.
Because the entire night from bunk 13.
You would hear carl yelling nocturnal.
Nocturnal nocturnal nocturnal nocturnal.
Nocturnal and at first we were like hi.
Carl you weird i'll go to bed but after.
Two to three nights of yelling nocturnal.
Nocturnal nocturnal every night we were.
Like oh    this dude might actually be.
Nocturnal and then a rumor started that.
One kid one night saw him talking to a.
Raccoon.
Who knows but needless to say everyone.
In the cabin was losing sleep because.
This kid just would not shut up at night.
So picture this you got a camp full of.
Drowsy dumb sixth graders throwing.
Tomahawks and trying to identify poison.
Oak it was a disaster kids were getting.
Hit an ad with tomahawks at every turn.
So one night one of the kids in our.
Cabin was over it right so he goes up to.
Carl and he says hey carl we all know.
You're nocturnal and stuff but would you.
Mind being quiet for tonight you know.
Jess i just want to get some sleep you.
See though carl must not have liked that.
Question because car.
Out of his bed and yes that's right up.
Hadlock the kids lips were bleeding so.
Bad that he had to get sent home but.
Somehow ever let carlos stay with a.
Warning that's right the kid who threw a.
Padlock at another kid's face was.
Allowed to stay and continue throwing.
Tomahawks at camp now looking back as an.
Adult i'm aware that our camp counselors.
Were probably like permanently on drugs.
But i digress.
Dave for comes around and little sixth.
Grade logan is so far being exhausted.
And all i want to do was find tadpoles.
And build fires and run around and do.
Fun camp stuff but this kid car was.
Ruining it with his nocturnal.
So one day we're walking to plant.
Identification class and karl is added.
Again nocturnal nocturnal nocturnal.
Nocturnal nocturnal nocturnal.
Someone had to stop this madness man so.
I put my foot down i sack up and i say.
Yo karl.
Jennifer god and for whatever reason he.
Had big double d batteries at the time.
Maybe he shoved them up his butt at.
Night that's why he was always awake and.
Cause he had energy right but anyways he.
Threw one of his ass batteries at me and.
He streamed and this kid was bigger than.
Me at the time i didn't have muscles yet.
So i was like damn i'm not about to.
Fight this kid and then i was like no.
Way cuz he'd probably try to fight my.
Ear off or something.
So i did the next best thing and as karl.
Was walking in the door in front of me.
I'd shut the door on him that's right i.
Tried to smush karl in the doorframe and.
For some reason i thought that would get.
My point across but oh no karl freakin.
Snapped in front of everyone he grabbed.
Me i grabbed him i'm like oh    it's.
Going down i'm fighting the raccoon kid.
I slammed him up against the wall at.
This point everyone is like what is.
Happening the camp counselors are off.
Doing drugs somewhere in the forest it's.
Frickin chaos my forearm is on his neck.
I got a pinned against the wall and this.
Dude almost instinctively    his head.
Back and sinks his teeth into my arm.
I'm like did this kid just bite me.
Everyone's like does that kid just bite.
Logan i had never seen this tactic in a.
Fight before i was only in sixth grade i.
Didn't know what was happening so i let.
Go partially because i'm in pain and.
Partially because i think i have rabies.
Now but i'm like okay you wanna fight.
Dirty let's fight dirty you nocturnal.
Son of a    so then i run that's.
Right i've run away from the table but.
This kid is tasty he wanted to finish.
What he started into my entire arm off.
The whole lunchroom is watching this i.
Have had enough at this point so i give.
My battle call i grab a chair from under.
The table and as hard as i can throw it.
At his face as he's foaming at the mouth.
Chasing me.
Right to the dome bro carla collapses in.
The floor and he starts screaming i'm.
Gonna get you you're gonna pay for this.
Dude's out of a    i'm like    bro.
I gotta go treat my arm so i run away.
Word quickly spread and the counselors.
Decided that throwing a padlock at a.
Kid's face and shooting a hole in my arm.
Was enough to evidence the second carl.
Home and little sixth-grade logan was.
Hailed as the chair throwing hero.
We all got a good sleep that night and.
Live dre be free happily ever.
Applause.

You.
