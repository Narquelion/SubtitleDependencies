Year let's start with number one.
Internet domination low gang we became.
The fastest channel to hit 10 million.
Subscribers in the history of youtube.
Ever.
Music.
It took us 333 days and i got my diamond.
Plaque this is pretty cool but the.
Plaque was only a small representation.
Of how strong the low gang truly is.
Realize our true power after we made.
History by shutting down the dubai mall.
With the biggest meet-and-greet in the.
World yeah.
Music.
Next level guys 2.8 billion views on.
Youtube this year even old people know.
Who i am.
I also continue to break down the.
Barriers of traditional hollywood as.
Internet star turned actor political.
Even chattier than me named mickey bowen.

About my movie airplane mode starring.
Your favorite social media stars coming.
To youtube reds in january i don't know.
If i'm alive.
Yeah so that's cute that's fufu.
But the biggest game-changer for me the.
Thing that helped me build all of this.
Was when i started the hottest clothing.
Line on the market maverick by logan.
Paul we had our first maverick pop-up.
Shop in new york and we shut down soho.
For three days straight.
He's insane seeing everyone joining the.
Revolution and following the brand.
Literally we possibly work city kings.
About 40 million dollars because the.
Planning wasn't the best that's my bed.
New york i also took my shirt off hit.
Head what's new.
But it's funny because the second pop-up.
Store was actually on a first class.
Flight to dubai and just a little.
Forewarning i don't think i'm allowed to.
Fly on it again throw me off the balloon.
But it's all good cuz that was fire baby.
Wow.
Life is amazing guys i've learned a lot.
This year too and i think even though.
I'm a young charge everyone can take a.
Piece of wisdom with them from my.
Experiences cuz i've done a lot of guys.
I believe that life is all about a.
Mindset it's about perspective or how.
You look at things for example check.
This out hey so for me guys the grind is.
Real like i'm barely sleeping but i.
Found what it is that i love so i.
Started saying i don't work but i work.
Hard maybe start thinking like this i.
Don't have to go to work.
I get to go to work right i don't have.
To go to school i get to go to school i.
Get to learn think grow better because.
Not everyone has that luxury.
Needless to say 2017 was absolutely.
Crazy but let's go rapid-fire for a.
Second cuz here are some things i left.
Out i shipped my roommate evan to paris.
In a bag i crashed france's first ever.
Saturday night live i don't know with.
The rock again i faked my death and then.
Got kicked out of my apartment for that.
But then i moved and then also got.
Kicked out of that apartment too i.
Officiated a wedding i filled my.
Brother's pool with slime presented a.
Billboard music award filled my bust.
With balls caught a homeless guy trying.
To steal my bus and touched reptiles.
With my mom.

Service arrest my brother jake.
I also made a diss track against my.
Brother that got 200 million total views.
After i released the second verse in.

Baby cd but that's only because he made.
A discharge against me getting ish he.
Didn't mean that we both ended up.
Apologizing but we did perform the.
Second verse live.
Like i said though guys we made up with.
Each other like actually love the kid.
Jake i love you sidenote.
Don't use us as examples when it comes.

Year i realized life's not short.
You just got to do more.
Music.
Here's some other stuff i learned from.
This year number one exceed expectations.
It's not overachieving but it's always.
Doing that little extra step to impress.
People to the theory of yes but know.
Where everything is possible until it's.
Not and even then it's still possible.
Number three your team your squad the.
People who you surround yourself with.
Make sure other people who are willing.
To put their heart and soul into every.
Project you undertake and people who are.
Just as crazy as you.
Music.
Applause.

And lastly be different be a maverick.
Don't be afraid to go right when they go.
Left that's how you dent the universe.
What is no-one else doing.
It's called market-making personally my.
Goal isn't to be the biggest actor in.
The world or even the biggest.
Businessman i'm gonna be the biggest.
Entertainer on the planet so i gotta do.
Both and it's so crazy because the scary.
Part is the part that most people don't.
Understand.
