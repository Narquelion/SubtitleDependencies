So tell me what happened.
So basically i just in 21 kind of so i.
Did was i had put surgery this is like.
My six foot surgery at the time and i.
Couldn't do anything really and i live.
In aspen colorado at least right now so.
I decided hey i can't do anything with.
Like this lake app on my foot i'm gonna.
Go drive up to somewhere beautiful one.
Shoot photos you know fire yourself.
Myself just try to create i'm just.
Trying to create themself exactly and.
This place is out of cell service now.
Notice that kind of adventurous type.
Yeah we try to be yeah exactly nom there.
Was this popular campground or place to.
Shoot my heard for the lake and all that.
I never been to so i pull up to the.
Bridge to get to this place off the main.
Road there and i saw a fair warning.
Signs and all this i was like oh maybe.
If i go past these signs whatever if i.
Stay in the car a bear can't kill me you.
Know but legit nasa least of my worries.
Obviously i come up on this truck facing.
One way and this other car there.
Basically parallel and i saw just two.
Chains or guys with their hands on top.
Of their head and i get like yeah like.
That the two guys yeah standing like.
That yeah i thought you guys staying.
Like this exactly after that i started.
Inching forward and i saw a car.
The truck i saw hand come out of the.
Truck and waving forward and so i went.
Forward and then he came out with the.
Gun we weren't that far like maybe fifty.
Feet away from each other or something.
I thought maybe okay maybe i have a few.
Grand worth of camera equipment in my.
Car i have you know i have my wallet.
It's not filled with long showers good.
Job so just i wasn't robbed me like like.
Okay so the first of the first for me i.
Can get through this but no it wasn't.
That at all he had no intention of.
Robbing he had no intention of robbing.
Me at all his intentions for some way.
There to kill me this guy who you don't.
Even know he doesn't even know you.
Wanted to end your life yeah he was dead.
Whatsoever i pull up people's economy is.
To chance eventually get away so how'd.
They get away their distractors our he.
Was yeah so there was another car.
Pulling up so he started pointing a gun.
At them and then i kind of got the hint.
At their plug in a run and if i had the.
Opportunity i am 100% when i took the.
Chance to run but your foot is broken.
Yeah and it wasn't it wasn't there so.
When they ran that was kind of like it.
For me i was like you know those the.
Only opportunity i had there's no little.
Service here there's no one here this.
Guy clearly wants to kill someone today.
Like this is maybe this is his way to.
You're the only one left i'm the only.
One left with a broken foot with the.
Parsley what's going through your mind.
That i didn't get to do what i want to.
Do with the end of my life that my.
Family i could say by them i think it.
Basically live the life i want to live.
Bro.
And i just 100% wasn't ready to die when.
You're in that kind of situation it's.
Hard to really put into words and you.
Think your life flashes ahead of you and.
All that like they do in the movies and.
All that men.
Let me also do it done that's not empty.
But that's what i'm saying.
You guys this does not happen in real.
Life like this like it's a miracle grow.
Like in people either ar ready for it b.
Or don't think it'll never happen but.
This this happened to you and it's.
Possible man and it's the craziest.
People don't understand and the closest.
They will ever understand that happening.
God forbid that never happens to anyone.
You know or you but you are a living.
Walking miracle bro and this this.
Feeling and this energy people are never.
Going to experience at some point to.
Conquer them.
And they try to negotiate with them and.
I was kind of a middle man with a.
Yelling in distance yeah i'm like you.
Know this not at this point at least if.
He shoots me at least they can take him.
Out and prevent him from hurting someone.
Else yeah but at the same time i wasn't.
Ready to give up yeah i was never that.
Kind of guy so i started reading him and.
I started like analyzing his movements.
Seemed aspired whatnot this guy's crazy.
He's also willing to die and wanting to.
Die and the cops offered him what he.
Will here's a square million dollars.
He's asking for all this stuff what i.
Got from him was he doesn't want that he.
Like was there to give us all that day.
How did you end up escaping from ours.
You hear my run-down apartment right now.
At that moment i had regretted so much i.
Knew i wasn't happy even only at 21.
Years old you've been at 21 years old i.
Knew there's so much more i want to do.
That's so much regret.
How much needed from in my lifetime it's.
Like something came over me.
Where i wasn't going to die on the.
Elephant a lesson is dad taken which i.
Hadn't do something about it at one.
Point she open the rear driver's side.
Door and it kind of sat a little bit.
Into it and i saw him getting paranoid.
And looking around like checking her.
Snipers and stuff like that at one.
Moment still this close on each other.
He backed up and looked away towards the.
Street and it almost led it was like and.
So i kind of like ducked behind the.
Truck man right there and just waiting.
For bulls to fly and i just heard.
Screaming and yelling and swearing all.
This stuff and i knew i had run up this.
Dirt road and make it to the cops and so.
I just started why was a friend i'm kind.
Of like no hopping probably canada when.
I got to the cops.
Everyone at the top of that road and saw.
Him get escorted a car out i didn't.
Believe i was there i still thought that.
