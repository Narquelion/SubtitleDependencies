Real fighter okay.
All right well you know your coach said.
That about you we'll see on saturday yes.
We will let farther than is he your.
Coach i mean yes then why is he saying.
You're not a real fighter am i missing.
Something or are you not a real fighter.

Yes it was just hard for me to follow.
This kids logic he says he's a fighter.
But his own coach says he's not a.
Fighter he doesn't bleed well he bleeds.
Internally like internal bleeding cuz if.
So that sounds like you need to seek.
Medical attention being totally honest.
With you guys i actually don't like.
Trash-talking and smack talking i'm just.
Like good at it because i can think fast.
On my feet and i'm kind of.
Annoying but it really makes him mad i'm.
