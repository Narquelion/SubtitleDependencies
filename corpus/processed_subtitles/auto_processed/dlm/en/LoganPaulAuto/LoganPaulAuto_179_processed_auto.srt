Oh we do it's done all we do it ooh as.
If this could not get any more exciting.
So little brother jake went first and.
Jesus christ this man ripped ended edgy.
Edgy uk's biggest mistake i think.
Everyone's favorite part jake and assad.
Edgy shoes they show up looking like.
Literally just dressed like bums.
Same with ksi overall both of their.
Brands are just like walmart brand for.
Example this is how they prepared in the.
Morning shumpert's loose loose loose and.
Then this is how the team paul prepared.
In the morning look in general they just.
Suck but the walmart chant was born.
I like that one.
I like that one there.
Oh okay anyways time for the big dog.
Anyways i walk right up on stage and i'm.
Not playing games i get right in jj's.
Face i'm like    and then i go hype.
Up the crowd a little bit.
Music.
Full of vegas.
You know how you play gotta do it right.
Away after static age of waters a little.
Bit i look jj right in his eyes i wanna.
See where his head's at.
Because every confrontation we've had up.
To this point he did not look me in the.
Eye.
And this time he's actually looking at.
Me so i'm like okay little little.
Boy grew some balls today that's good.
And the huge where it gets weird so the.
Morning of the fight jj posted a picture.
On his instagram stick out like try to.
Dig out it just deep bro it's only big.
Why would you post that picture in great.
Heights you got a little dick you why.
Are you giving me ammunition right.
Before the conference so i obviously i.
Capitalized on it looks like you grew a.
Little dick today oh yeah and i'm vegan.
And i'm vegan so i recognized a baby.
Carrot when i see one oh look man you.
Want to show your dick fine but at least.
Come pack and heat like me idiot no.
That's not a tumor that's my dick so.
Again this is just what i mean like over.
All these dudes is just they're just a.
Walmart brand everything they do is it.
Doesn't make sense it's weird it sucks.
Meanwhile jake and i looking like.
Frickin studs our brand is gucci and.
There's just just straight gooch and for.
Those of you who don't know the gooch is.
The area between the weiner and the.
Rectum okay so i think jj and deji.
Obviously being related are equally as.
Dumb like mentally they just function.
Slower than jake and i do mr. michael.
High is hard to do but they managed to.
Pull it off the only thing they kept.
Saying all the time was.
Creative creative.
Good job guys so good so my favorite.
Moment is when jake and i did not.
Rehearse this they started saying it and.
Just the brother the brother instinct.
Connected to jake and i were like yeah.
Bro if there is honestly one good thing.
That came out of this it is jake and i.
Connected like brothers like we haven't.
In a while we where we haven't been able.
To do something like this and forever so.
Yeah it's definitely gonna be fun to.
Beat up these these punk's together on.
August 25th.
So then jj starts talking i i didn't.
Mind it the more the more he talked the.
Dumber he looked i paul wait to punch.
You right in your stupid smug face when.
You feel when you like bro you're not a.
Supervillain you're not a dragon ball z.
Character do us all a favor and shut the.
Conference took a weird turn for some.
Reason everyone brought props they.
Brought props we brought props i better.
Turn into like a fifth grade.
Show-and-tell he brought his little like.
Toy story stuffed animals that he sleeps.
With a night and then he also brought.
The youtube for dummies book that he.
Bought and i got a mat with his face on.
It and started stomping on it and then.
We threw away some of our ksi toilet.
Paper with his face printed on it that.
By the way everyone in our house still.
Uses to this day and then you guys know.
I got it i got i got to do it i got to.
Make a bed and a joke how many of those.
Do you have besides the one i found in.
The back.
It's just cause like i'm wondering like.
Discern like why does she always wear it.
Like what's good what's underneath the.
Band and what is so sacred it's so.
Special about that black bandanna that.
He always has it on and then it happened.
Bro for everyone who thinks this was.
Like a joke or it's like fake beef it's.
Not i'm gonna beat the    out of the.
Kid i really don't like him but this is.
Where it got real this was the magical.
Moment of the press conference and it.
Actually was hand in hand with that that.
Disgusting smelly bandanna so jj's in.
The middle of mocking my apology video.
Obviously for everything that happened.
In january and i'm not gonna lie it was.
Pretty creative i had to respect it it.
Was funny but right away i got in his.
Face and i let the man talk for a little.
Bit because like i said like i was i was.
Like damn this is like homies getting me.
Good right here what can i expect it's.
The one joke everyone makes it's the one.
Thing everyone talks about and.
Rightfully so but anyways he starts.
Talking he says a couple lines and.
Eventually i'm just like i i take my.
Hand i tear the wig off and lo and.
Behold in front of me right in front of.
Me is the magical bandana.
All this is happening in a split second.
I'm like host i want that this is my.
Moment i could do the world a favor and.
Discover what's underneath that bad dan.
I don't even think a sigh knows what's.
Underneath it it could be my puppy that.
I lost in the seventh grade it could be.
The bridge to terabithia the fountain of.
Youth who knows i am so close to this.
Thing i have one shot that's hope i go.
To grab his bandana.
I got a grip on this mother and i go to.
Tear it off i kid you not in that moment.
It all made sense to me why he never.
Takes it off the answer is quite simply.
Because he can't that thing is glued to.
His head i'm not just saying this i.
Gripped it like all hands and i go to.
Pull up and it does not budge not an.
Inch.
Next thing you know i'm full i'm fully.
Extended then that thing is stuck on his.
Head so many thoughts are going through.
My brain right it looks like i just like.
Pushes his head really all i was trying.
To do was get this bandana off then i'm.
Like i secondly i feel bad for jay-z.
Because some sort of super blue accident.
Must have gone wrong that he actually.
Can't take the bandana off and i'm just.
Assuming it's super glue it could be.
Stapled to his head it could be taped i.
Could have been pinned in his hair the.
Point is he was stuck so i push him and.
That i had to start laughing about all.
And then madness broke out.
A little    board threw a temper.
Tantrum he got so mad he got so mad who.
Does that matt over bandana if you watch.
The video play-by-play i'm standing here.
Like what what is this kid trying like.
What does he think he's about to do.
Let's be honest aj you ain't gonna do.
Soup you're weak you're unathletic the.
Way you charge me in general is just.
Embarrassing just like in the boxing.
Match it's gonna be the same thing he's.
Gonna like try to do his thing and like.
Be all athletic i'm just gonna play with.
Him toy with him but just mop so i'm.
Standing there and he does manage he.
Hits my glasses off of my head to watch.
Slowly bounces in the air and you boy.
Catches them i'm just a straight-up.
Ninja bro okay i'm too quick for this.
And then his whole squad comes on chaos.
Breaks aah.
His trainer tries to slap my brother in.
The face and vidale by the way quick.
Message bro he's their trainer maybe if.
You weren't focused on training a bunch.
Of dweebs and you spent your time boxing.
Professionally like you should be that.
Slap would've landed so i think you.
Should hit the gym and get rid of that.
Beer belly and for now yeah i guess just.
Stick to protecting your.
So everything wraps up and then jj later.
In the week releases the video from his.
Perspective and he sounds like such such.
A little little boy like straight-up.
Just sounded so soft he was whining.
About it.
Music.
That's what i mean i doing anything boys.
She touching me just like seeing this.
Like after the fight you're probably.
Gonna be saying the same thing after i.
Knock you out i didn't do anything what.
She knocked me out like just shut up bro.
You're dealing with the dog now so step.
Up and be a man about it.
Anyways that was fun that's one of two.
