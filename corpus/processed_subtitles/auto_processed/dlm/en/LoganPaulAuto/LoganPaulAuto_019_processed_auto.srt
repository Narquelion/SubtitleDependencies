Mike's like the funny guy in the house.
But he had a 10-year battle with drug.
Addiction.
Uh heroin he's seen a lot of his friends.
Die he's been on the cusp of death.
Probably 10 to 20 times.
And he should be in jail for probably 20.
Years but he's not he's my roommate.
Who's also a felon.
I think i don't know uh regardless this.
Is a big day so two weeks ago we started.
The hunt to find the biggest billboard.
That we could just.
Ah smack mike's face on this is for my.
Friend's book cover i want to find a.
Place where it's super prominent.
Everyone can see his big beautiful face.
On a nice big old billboard oh.
Absolutely.
All right amazing 25k for    billboard.
Oh boy.
It's a lot of money okay right but what.
What is money is paper.
Comes and grows that's what you say it.
Comes and goes money is.
Paper you're talking yourself into doing.
The 25 000 that way is that what i'm.
Doing yeah i think so yeah hey let's do.
It my argument was only going to be that.
We have.
Most of the cash upstairs oh my god.
You're right the money from the mercedes.
Couch fifteen thousand dollars is it.
Seventeen.
No because we spent two can a weed.
We just gotta come up with ten thousand.
Dollars we can get a sponsor yo that is.
A good idea.
All right all right we'll get a sponsor.
So that brings me here guys today's.
Video is brought to you by.
No one no sponsors still which is.
Actually good because i prefer to do my.
Own thing and maverick clothing is the.
New wave again it used to be maverick by.
Logan paul.
Um removing myself from the equation.
Still be gonna be like a face of the.
Brand obviously.
But it's no longer about me we want to.
Make this big and not just an influencer.
Brand and you guys don't see it much on.
This channel but i have a very uh.
Inspirational like almost contagious.
Motivational side that instead of just.
Preaching about greatness and how.
Awesome everyone can be which i will do.
But i also stuck it on clothing because.
You wear clothes every day you get.
Reminded of it you get motivated you.
Want to go out and do some.
Change your life for the better i'm in.

Because she makes so much money.
We need to talk to amara immediately i.
Need ten thousand dollars from you.
Ten thousand yeah for what i'm afraid to.
Tell you.
Because it's a surprise i think you'll.
Ruin it i'm positive you will.
Actually here's what i'm not telling you.
The gift costs 25k.
I'm putting in 15k and i'm asking you.

Ten thousand dollars like like.
Amara truck the only way this is gonna.
Work if it's a surprise i'll see you.

Music.
So for my og low gangsters i used to.
Live in that building right there.
Actually that exact room and.
Unfortunately i also got kicked out but.
I figured it'd be monumental if i put my.
Best friend's billboard on one of the.
Most iconic buildings in social media.
History like this is literally the first.
Building that he visited me at first.
Building i smoked weeded dude i even.
Lost my virginity there.
Now all we have to do is get mike in my.
Car drive back here and surprise me.
She's waking up getting ready for the.
Day yeah i was up late.
Just working on the launch and    i.
Didn't get much sleep that's unfortunate.

Group of people is beyond anything that.
I've ever felt my entire life like each.
And every one of you guys are so.
Supportive and i literally love.
Each and every one of you my story and.
My journey up until today has been.
Painful but you guys make it easier and.
You guys make me feel like i want to be.
Here and i'm happy to be here.
Music.
Perfect.
When i got clean and i walked out of.
Rehab i walked out of rehab with a 400.
Credit score.
Up to my eyes in    debt because.
All i had was a computer that i would.
Pawn unpawn.
Pawn on pawn at that point it was so bad.
When you walk out and all of your.
Friends that you went to high school.
With they're married and they work for.
Dell and they have a 401k and they have.
Stock.
Options and your mom's driving you to n.
A meetings.
And you're 26 or you're 30 or you're 34.
And you've never once had.
Any idea about what to do in this on.
This spinning rock.
Here's what i will say to people.
Watching this that have no clue that.
Have no clue what they want to do.
How they want to do it because i was.
There i was just there it was a store i.
Was just there i started.
Trying things i knew i knew i had.
Something and i didn't know what it was.
I didn't know i wanted to be a youtuber.
I didn't have the luxury of.
Knowing what it was but i knew i had.
Something and let me tell you this.
If you've made it through addiction or.
Mental illness.
You have something because a lot of.
People don't.
If you are still kicking today.
Music.
Battling those demons you have something.
Because a lot of people didn't wake up.
Today because they couldn't make it.
They couldn't cut it and you    did.
So you have something.
But you might not know what it is.
