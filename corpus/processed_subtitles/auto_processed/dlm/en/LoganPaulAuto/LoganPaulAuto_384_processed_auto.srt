Today's video is actually it's my.
Analysis of my fight with ksi and look i.
Know what you're thinking right the ksi.
Thing is getting old we've been talking.
About the fight for too long and i agree.
I promise this is my last video talking.
About the fight until we figure out when.
The rematch is gonna be but i figured.
It'd be cool to talk about what was.
Going on in my mind during the biggest.
Internet event in history during my.
First ever boxing match yeah bro yeah.
Let's dive in oh my god yo oh hearing.
Him say my name like this is the let's.
Get ready to rumble dude like you see.
I'm like walking out like trying to act.
Cool and stuff in my mind i'm just like.
Fanboy and so hard so during the whole.
Ring walk i'm not gonna lie i was oddly.
Calm yeah i had one goal it was to beat.
The sh out of ksi nothing else really.
Mattered like i phased out the crowd my.
Friends everything i got in there i.
Raised my hands and by the way to every.
One of my fans and jake's fans that.
Showed up at the arena you guys were.
Absolutely amazing i'm surprised that.
There weren't more ksi and edgy fans.
There it actually seemed pretty even.
They know they can't touch us.
Boo boo ksi came out wearing the full.
Mask obviously and i did not see this.
But this is oh god this has got to be.
The cheesiest most cringe thing i've.
Ever seen in my life and i'm i can be.
Pretty cringe like i've made some pretty.
Cringe content but this is bad dude.
He's in a horror movie he like turns his.
Head he's like here's the best part look.
It i'm not even looking at him my back.
Is turned right i didn't even see that.
We're just happening so then we're.
Facing off again i'm pretty chill.
Jj's making kissy lips at me and he's.
Like he's moving him up and down it's.
Really really weird you guys know this.
He loves to play the mental game and so.
Like still literally moments before the.
Fight he's like trying to get in my head.
But again i had like tunnel vision right.
Now so no matter how hard he tried to.
Kiss me was not gonna faze me so the.
Bell rings we're kind of getting a feel.
For each other he's thrown a couple.
Punches i'm throwing a couple jabs right.
Off the bat i learned that he's actually.
Surprisingly quick cuz i'm pretty quick.
But he was he was dodging some punches.
He was moving like at a pretty good pace.
And again at this point my boxing career.
I don't really know what i'm doing.
But i did realize i was a little bit.
Faster so i got pretty comfortable yeah.
Big right hand right there but it's.
Crazy cause like i'm in the ring with.
This guy who's this incredible.
Invincible youtubing boxing rapping dude.
And like in the first round i'm big.
Right hand just i'm    this dude up.
So right here like ksi does this all the.
Time right there like i don't know what.
This is or how after a year of training.
You're still doing this stuff like what.
These aren't punches man so there's.
About one minute left and i start to.
Enjoy myself because i'm like damn i'm.
Quicker than this dude he's sloppy ish.
I'm gonna have fun so i turn on the jets.
Dude this jabs are so quick like there's.
Nothing he can do and i know that so i.
Put my hands down just snap these jabs.
Out bang bang bang at this point i'm.
Having so much fun like i'm literally.
Just smiling cuz it's my fight i'm.
Controlling it he's literally at the.
Mercy of my hands i'm such an a-hole i.
Was like shaking my head and stuff like.
Yo what's good like what are you gonna.
Do because like again this is not like.
The ksi we see on the internet.
This dude's getting picked apart in.
Front of millions of people it gets.
Really bad right here big right hand and.
Then watch bang bang bang bang oh one.
More time baby it's just a big right.
Hand and then it's just a 1 3 2 3 all of.
Them land followed up with another hook.
This is where i stop and i should have i.
Don't know why i did this but i stopped.
And i'm i'm holding my arms out like.
Let's go bro what's good and i should.
Have just attacked him.
I coulda ended the fight right there.
What jj is good at what i'm good at - we.
Can both take hits we both got really.
Good chin's what that she does rattle.
You it does faze you if you get hit hard.
Like sure you can take hits but if your.
Brain hits the edge of your skull like.
That's it so this is my mistake just.
Stopping like that that's not gonna.
Happen again in the next fight it's.
Funny though because after those two.
Punches right there you can see ksi like.
Just oh my god that's such a flush jab.
Uh-huh bang you can see right there this.
Is where he started to respect me you.
Could see he oh because after this.
Flurry of punches this is where i saw.
His spirit break ksi the internet guy.
Became jj some kid from london you guys.
Know before the fight we were going back.
At it playing mental games whether it.
Was on twitter youtube whatever like he.
Tweeted me once you're a    hole i'm.
Gonna put you in deep waters boy you can.
Do whatever you want to try to protect.
Yourself but it won't matter.
Just wait at logan pole and then you hit.
Him with these four punches one after.
Another i'm like are those the deep.
Waters you were talking about cuz you.
Kind of look like a    right now.
You're a scared little boy you're in way.
Over your head i know you're scared.
Logan it's okay to be soon your audience.
Will realize you're all you're not all.
That and then again it's like oh my.
Audience is gonna realize that literally.
I'm playing ping-pong with your brain.
Inside of your skull ridiculous anyways.
The first round ends i go to my corner.
You can see my coach is jumping up and.
Down like a like a little boy who just.
Found his first pubic hair i'm sitting.
In my corner literally like almost a.
Hundred percent energy feeling savage i.
Know i just beat the    out of this.
Guy and i'm not just saying this this.
Was easier that any sparring session i.
Had this year literally so i'm sitting.
There and i'm thinking this is my fight.
This is easy work there's no way this.
Guy is gonna beat me i even said to my.
Coach at one point i go you know milt.
Why is this so easy.
I have sparred potatoes that were better.
Than this so second round starts he's a.
Little scrappy or he started to turn on.
The jets a little bit okay i knew it was.
Coming eventually but still i'm quicker.
Than him he's a little sloppy so the.
Jabs at land land land every time.
There's two jabs right there then what.
Look what is this dude what is this.
Punch what is that.
Who wants to go pro he doesn't even know.
How to throw a punch my god bro.
It's just domination literally it's too.
Easy i'm quicker than him i see his.
Punches coming from a mile away i watch.
This he goes to throw the big right pull.
Back uppercut and then straight right to.
The circuit oh and then again i make the.
Mistake of standing there versus jumping.
On him cuz i was like almost like.
Patting myself on the back like wow good.
Job you're doing good logan instead of.
Like actually boxing into the rope so at.
This point in the fight i had full.
Energy i felt great he was starting to.
Land some punches but still just bang.
Bang there's nothing he could do to stop.
Me and then you guys know that the clay.
Through the clinch.
That's my wrestling background kicking.
In and in boxing you can do this when.
You're in trouble or things aren't going.
Your way oh you even want to break you.
Can like hug the dude and clinch him and.
Get out of it and you can best believe.
If i'm in a position that i don't like.
I'm gonna grab the shoes to you and if.
You don't like it suck my ass this was.
Funny jordy was talking about how ksi.
Hits hard and there's like a four second.
Pause and then joe weller is i ignore he.
Doesn't live internet joe just had to.
Slip that in amazing but on that note i.
Didn't think he didn't hit hard.
I've sparred due to hit harder but like.
He throws big punches and when they land.
Like obviously they don't feel the.
Greatest i am so disappointed in myself.
For this so jj fakes up and then he goes.
To the body bang he does it again fake.
Up go to the body bang and then i should.
Have known there was something common.
Man it's happened to be in sparring.
Sessions this exact move does it again i.
Get whacked in the face oh yeah but i.
Knew he was gonna be like oh i hit him.
For the first time so immediately.
Returned all those so he hits me and.
Then bang bang bang three punches right.
Off the bat don't give him time to think.
And then a fast jab quick jab again guys.
I'm in like 90% energy right now i feel.
Amazing the pool backs are still there.
I'm still striking hard and then you.
Guys know the bell rings this this dude.
Oh my god look i've always been a fair.
For i've never i've never been one to.
Play dirty but this kid is a dirty.
Fighter man and this hit after the bell.
Like sure i didn't do anything but like.
What's good bro you can see like i turn.
And i'm like smiling it's you know what.
Are you gonna do and then jay cops in.
The ring i'm gonna be honest i have no.
Idea what jake was gonna do i don't want.
He was thinking i will say i have never.
Seen jake this the word to describe him.
Would be primal i've never seen his.
Heart so invested in something like the.
Dude who is cheering and yelling at me.
In my corner was not jake paul that.
Night because remember guys jake was.
Fighting desi and again desi man you.
Impressed all of us but we all know you.
Were gonna lose jake we all we all knew.
Jake was gonna win that fight brother.
Jake i love you for this bro i know you.
Were mainly doing it for me you were.
Mainly doing it to push me and make sure.
I was where i needed to be for this.
Fight and jake actually told me he was.
More nervous and hyped for my fight than.
He was his own so jake bro you know this.
I love you thank you man this dude.
Always got my back.
Even if he's gonna stop himself in the.
Middle of the ring so it's the end of.
The second round i'm in my corner and.
I'm at straight-up.
I'm talking to my coach i feel great i'm.
At like 90% energy i cannot be stopped.
Like i just won the first two rounds.
Without a doubt so the bell rings right.
Here i don't know what the    happened.
Literally had zero energy i was feeling.
So good like invincible the bell rang i.
Was like what the    is wrong with me.
Where is all my energy god just.
Dissipate it in a matter of seconds and.
I'm like oh it's literally it's the.
Beginning of the third round i have four.
Rounds to go how am i gonna do this like.
Look i don't know why the ref was taking.
This time to talk to ksi but i'm like.
Leaning on the ropes i'm literally like.
I'm sitting there like oh this sucks i.
Don't know how about to do these next 12.
Minutes i'm dead right now and that was.
The beginning of the end of logan paul.
So we start this is where ksi 1ups me he.
Went like this like he was getting more.
And more energy so i'm still in the game.
Obviously like three two big punches.
Like who knows to jj for taking these.
And like like dude's got a warrior.
Spirit for sure that's the one takeaway.
From this fight but again it.
I realize i'm faking it so ksi would.
Land a couple i get him in the clinch.
I'm i'm sort of buying time and i'm sort.
Of trying to get him off of me like it.
Looks like he's doing stuff right only.
Like one of those landed but jo weller.
Actually did a full breakdown of this.
Round if you guys really want to see you.
Should go check out his video he did not.
Land that many punches it looked like.
Because he was swinging a lot and.
Everyone in the arena thought like he.
Was the aggressor but he missed most of.
Them and when it comes to significant.
Strikes there was less than three so.
About halfway through the third this is.
Definitely where the table started to.
Turn like check this out i throw this.
Big right hand bang get him across the.
Chin but he's like now i'm not done yet.
But again he missed that punch but look.
When you play it in fast motion it looks.
Like he lands it but i was robbed man.
From this fight i think most people that.
Watch it back afterwards realize but.
Damn this sucks and listen you can hear.
The commentators say he's landing now.
He's landing now no he's not but it.
Looked like it cuz his hands are flying.
Everywhere story of the fight man ksi.
Misses with a big right hand.
Jordie is so right he goes logan's.
Looking a little bit tired now yeah yeah.
Man literally had zero in my tank i was.
Just faking it at this point so this is.
Where he threw me.
I was not happy about that man for me.
It's frustrating cuz it's like dude if.
You want to throw me again let's do mma.
Let's make the rematch happen in the.
Octagon but i know you won't do that cuz.
You're a little    and you're using.
Your own words and you have to fight.
Dirty you throw me down in a boxing.
Match just like bro i've said it before.
You are a scumbag of a fighter i cannot.
Wait to hit you so hard you forget how.
To make youtube videos that's right i.
Said it.
Bell rings and around three look at me.
Literally bend over first thing i do i'm.
Like holy shh coach sat me down yo.
What's going on i'm like i don't know.
Man he's like yo you what are you tired.
I'm like yeah i'm tired coach he goes.
Tell me you know get tired.
Which i did i did tell him that all.
Through training camp we'd be running.
Stairs running whatever doing sprints.
And he'd be like you tired in every.
Trying to be like you know a man i.
Thought i'd be like i don't get tired.
But i don't know something happened in.
This fight we're like all my energy was.
Drained so quick so i look at him i'm.
Like yeah coach i lied i'm freaking.
Tired now no you're not this is your.
Fight get up there and like so it's.
Round four i'm like i at this point i.
Got to play smart so i made a mental.
Note before this round i'm like i'm.
Literally gonna cruise through this.
Round so i can have enough energy to win.
The fifth round and get that four to.
Decision pretty much everything i'm.
Throwing here it's a little sloppy it's.
To keep him off me keep me looking busy.
But this was 100% definitely is round he.
Just controlled it his sort of scrappy.
Movements and energy played to his.
Advantage here this part was interesting.
We got in this clinch here and i push.
Him over and he like a like he's so.
Dramatic he puts both arms out and he's.
Just playing himself on the ropes you.
Can see my arm is cocked back and i made.
The decision not to break his ribs i'm a.
Good sport about it next time i'm going.
To it's a fight so i definitely should.
Have been an    my pit what's my.
Pig doing pearl bingbing what are you.
Doing she's so cute that pearl bingbing.
On instagram by the way so it's n around.
For you could see i'm in the corner i am.
Dying bro like this is death to me if.
You've ever felt this feeling before it.
Might be the worst feeling in the world.
Just completely out of energy but.
Knowing you still have more to do and.
This is where the mental game comes in.
Luckily this is what i've been training.
My whole entire life for fifth round.
This is it i saved up enough energy.
Right away comes out of the back right.
So i knew i was gonna win this round i.
Told myself again.
If i like the fight was under my control.
If i wanted to win around i could do it.
The only thing i was playing with was.
The levels of energy i had this is the.
Moment right here that won me this round.
So right here he starts doing this duck.
Thing and i hit him with one punch right.
There on the side of his head and he.
Must have been rattled a little bit like.
He was guarding but it was strictly.
Defensive i want to win on the offense.
And just through a flurry of punches and.
As i'm throwing these i'm like dude i.
Hope one of these knocks him out because.
If this doesn't work i have no energy.
Left this face right here this is the.
Face of disappointment that you still.
Have a round and a half to.
So i turn around i'm like oh yeah i'm.
Still fighting okay so we get in there.
And then again just sloppy boxing from.
Both of us it's just exhaustion but he.
Doesn't make that final push that would.
Have run hit one hand around back so.
It's the other on fire i look fast.
Forward to do this look i'm just leaning.
On the ropes oh my god i can't emphasize.
Enough how dead i am i don't even need a.
Trained boxing this next for the rematch.
Duty if i just have more energy can you.
Imagine if i didn't get tired.
The fights mine easy this dude's not.
Boxing he's like backyard brawling oh my.
God i feel i feel bad for myself so it's.
The final round at this point ksi didn't.
Finish me like he said he was gonna do.
In the fourth round.
I didn't finish him like i said i was.
Gonna be doing the third round we both.
Realized that we're being warriors and.
This is gonna be a dogfight.
Unfortunately for me at this point the.
Fight i was a bag of wet noodles that's.
That's the best way to describe me look.
It okay i pushed me at one point and the.
Ref turns his back i literally take a.
Break and i just sit on the ropes like.
That him be a maverick like who tells.
You you're not allowed to do that during.
The middle of a boxing match i'm a rule.
Breaker baby read the merge read the.
Frickin merge dude by the way if you.
Haven't copped it yet you know where to.
Do so link in description.
Or look appalled calm slash shop so put.
Quite simply this six round mentally i.
Was sent back into the third grade this.
Is where i was not quicker than him i.
Wasn't anything better than him so he.
Was able to land these big punches and.
Again if he didn't knock me out i'm just.
The type of dude like i could take these.
Hits so unless i go unconscious like you.
Know i'm still gonna keep coming forward.
Oh my god this is so this is just a dog.
Fight got to give it to a man gotta give.
It to him don't like the kid but got to.
Give it to him so there's about 15.
Seconds left when i say i'm on the verge.
Of death it's not a joke literally he's.
Just bang bang head shot body shot i am.
About to collapse i'm like when is this.
Bell ring bell rings this might be the.
Greatest moment of my life like i was so.
Really the first thing i do is go over.
To the ropes and lean over just sheer.
Relief and they picked him up right away.
I'm like what i'm like bro you.
Definitely didn't win.
To either one or it was a draw but i.
Knew i didn't lose and j told me the.
Same thing he's like yo you did not lose.
But you might have had a draw and sure.
Enough dude raises both of our hands.
Just confusion no idea what's going on.
No idea what a majority draw means or.
How that conclusion was reached cuz.
Again i'm not a boxer i didn't study.
Boxing everyone is just confused my.
Coach goes that's good it means you.
Didn't lose and in my mind i'm like okay.
But i also didn't win and then the first.
Thought was like damn the rematch is.
Gonna be that much crazy you like that.
Would happen that would happen in my.
Life where it's just a tie but.
Nonetheless it was fun i obviously know.
Going into it next time that if i don't.
Get tired there's no chance of me losing.
I don't even want to sit here and like.
Say how bad i'm gonna be ks higher like.
The things i'm gonna do to him i'll.
Leave that up to your guy's imagination.
And ksi you know bro there's literally.
No hope but i respect you as a fighter.
