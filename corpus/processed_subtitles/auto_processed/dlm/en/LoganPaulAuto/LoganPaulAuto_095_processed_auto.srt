Am i gonna text my old pal gary v yeah.
You've seen this sports card thing.
Of course side note he's talking about.
The recent booming sports cards sports.
Cards sports cards.
Apparently there's a lot of money to be.
Made investing in sports cards but.
Unfortunately i don't know anything.
About sports cards but i did collect.
Pokemon cards when i was younger i told.
Them.
Brother it's the new art pokemon.
Ironically at the top get educated on.
Pokemon.
All right    it i'm gonna do it i love.
Pokemon shouldn't be too hard.
And it wasn't turns out pokemon is the.
Highest grossing media franchise of all.
Time coming in at over 90 billion.
Dollars ahead of hello kitty star wars.
Mario harry potter and marvel and with.
The 25th anniversary of pokemon coming.
Up next year i don't see that changing.
Anytime soon.
Now i've left pokemon my whole life.
Literally played the games all.
Throughout high school made a couple of.
Vibral pokemon videos on pokemon art and.
I only have one tattoo on my body it's a.
Pokemon named squirtle next to my penis.
So i knew there was a lane here that i.
Did indeed have a passion for.
So the first thing i did was find an.
Expert crazy bro i feel like i'm you're.
Delivering me drugs this feels like i'm.
Trafficking a kilo.
But like the price is actually probably.
More than that's what i'm saying.
Look at this look at this meet jake a.
Collectible guru also known as.
Collectiblesguru on instagram.
He was nice enough to sell me seven of.
These little pieces of cardboard for.
Fifty thousand dollars.
Yes i paid fifty thousand dollars for.
Seven pokemon cards and it gets worse.
Just wait all of the cards have red.
Label red label is our ps4 this one.
Is bgs base set first edition shadowless.
First edition thin stamp thick stamp.
Okay so what is this guy saying.
Psa9 bgs10 std69 blah blah holographic.
First edition bsa charge.
What let me break it down when it comes.
To card collectibles there are two main.
Grading services psa and bgs.
Grading means they rate the card the.
Higher the rating the more valuable the.
Older the card the more value and the.
Rarer the card the most valuable.
This dark blue shadow behind it.
Decreases the value and the only.
Difference on one you go to stamp on one.
You got a shadow all right i'm gonna.
Keep this simple.
Pokemon first released what is called.
Not surprisingly the first edition base.
Set indicated by.
The little first edition stamp on the.
Cards these have the most value the.
Second release did not have this stamp.
And is also known as the shadowless set.
Still highly valuable because of the.
Lack of shadow behind the pokemon which.
The following set the regular base set.
Did have.
So first first edition stamp second.
Shadowless third base set.
Has a shadow got it this is beautiful.
This is the one.
Yeah this is the one the holy grail of.
Cards this is a nine it just broke.
Twenty five thousand this card is a.
Twenty 25 000.
Piece of cardboard and you will.
Literally be able to sell it probably.
Between.
35 and 40 000 by christmas.
What the    bro now i could already.
Tell that i was gonna like this.
It's nostalgic it's a strategic.
Investment and most importantly.
I was having so much    fun so.
I started buying more and more.
Music.
And more.
Oh these are so cool one of my favorite.
Pokemon gengar also one of my favorite.
Pokemon of all time.
First edition yellow cheeks pikachu.
Three thousand dollar card right here.
Don't mind if i.
Do i'm like officially a collector.
As my collection grew so did my.
Excitement for the hobby i started.
Watching pokemon professionals doing.
Advanced research on ebay and even met.
Up with some pretty passionate.
Collectors.
Slabs on slabs look at signs signs.
Signed and sketched top one pop one this.
Is the only one.
In the    world i found out instead.
Of buying the cards outright you could.
Even buy what's called the booster box.
Which comes with 36 packs of cards 12 of.
Which are guaranteed to have a.
Holographic card in it.
If just one of those cards is a.
Charizard you hit the jackpot.
In fact josie actually pulled one from a.
Random base pack eyeball.
Music.
Don't touch it don't even look at it.
Don't breathe on it and then she ended.
Up doing it again.
Shut the    up shut the.
Up but yeah at the time base set booster.
Boxes were going for about fifteen.
Thousand dollars so i bought one.
I like this little booster box so much i.
Decided to buy another.
And another and then two more.
I was a bad boy in a booster seat buying.
Base that booster boxes.
But i admit i was in too deep and my.
Obsession was growing i was about to hit.
The pinnacle of the pokemon pyramid.
Period and look what's on my screen this.
Is a first.
Edition booster box and it's a lot of.
Fun money and uh.
