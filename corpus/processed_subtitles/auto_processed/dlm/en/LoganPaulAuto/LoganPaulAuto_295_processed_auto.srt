Gonna have them speak honestly cuz this.
Is what happened that morning when we.
Were in class what conversation took.
Place first off i got to start by saying.
You spoke this into existence literally.
It was my fault there's a hard time at.
All at the beginning of a skydiving.
Class we get into harnesses and they.
Basically run you through some checks.
Right so we're doing the emergency.
Procedures casually yeah nothing but air.
Ii gotta know this guy starts starts.
Kind of like letting his imagination.
Loose the wrong way i'm just like yo.
Like what what are the chances actually.
Happens like why would i why would i cut.
Away of my main treats that kind of open.
Logan says yo i feel like a lot of crazy.
Stuffs been happened to me this could go.
Wrong the teachers like basically just.
Like no there's no way you're gonna be.
Fine you got to know it but you're fine.

Parachute takes three to six seconds to.
Open i go to pull the pull the ripcord.
But he was right as i pull it it gets.
Stuck in this like little square shape.
So i'm like okay cuz you're still going.
Right so i'm like i'm gonna give this a.
Second like it could still open up it's.
Happen before it takes like a second.
Longer to open up but i'm also spinning.
Right the cord is wrapping around i'm.
Getting a line twist they call it and.
About four seconds in i realized the.
Pears are still nasty opening so i.
Started tugging on it i'm like oh okay.
Remember three to six seconds for this.
Thing to be fully open real time i'm.
Gonna play exactly how long it was when.
It wasn't open.
It's like not it's like 9 seconds i.
Think i don't know but we showed you a.
Building yeah so eventually i'm like um.
I am gonna die i'm gonna die first up i.
Can't believe this is happening cuz i.
Talked about it this morning literally i.
Had this conversation this morning.
Verbatim the only thing i said was oh i.
Look red i grab red i peel pool just.
Like they taught us and my main.
Parachute detaches and i'm like hole.
