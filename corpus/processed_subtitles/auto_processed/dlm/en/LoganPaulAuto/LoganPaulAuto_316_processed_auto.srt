Been meeting to make this vlog for now.
I've been meaning to make this vlog for.
A while i wasn't sure when the right.
Time to do it was but okay listen let's.
Talk about no it is a big deal it is a.
Big deal when i first started doing.
Youtube i was at about a half million.
Subscribers which actually by the way.
Evan is that right now and he's he has.
Like two videos out screw you wait and i.
Made this video called these glasses.
Cured my colorblindness currently i'm.
Looking at it it has 19 million views.
I'm talking anyways i'm sure you've seen.
The video but if you haven't the gist of.
It is i got these glasses and they cure.
To my colorblindness well that was the.
Title and that's what i made it look.
Like i had this big reaction i put the.
Sunglasses on i went throughout the day.
Like explaining what color blindness was.
Blah blah here watch i'm color blind and.
Inside this box are glasses that will.
Fix my colorblindness i'm a certain type.
Of colorblind as for example i can see.
This too.
Top as you can imagine i got a lot of.
Hate a lot of people made fun of me a.
Lot of people said it was fake said i.
Wasn't colorblind yeah yeah i got made.
Fun of them don't like you make fun up.
There you know i know so can you stop.
Elise sorry i just i get made fun of too.
So yeah anyways a lot of people made fun.
Of me a lot of big youtubers watch this.
Music.
Applause.
Music.
And i'm just sitting here like damn i.
Just started youtube why am i the center.
Of attack right now because the worst.
Part about it i'm just gonna say right.
Now i am color blind however there were.
Some things i did in the video where i.
Made a mistake and opened the doors for.
Getting made fun of so like your birds.
Just one color to you what your bird is.
Just one color yeah to you what what.
You're saying but he's like four.
Different colors he's all of those.
Colors he's orange red yellow maverick.
Yeah my bird your bird man whose burden.
We'll be talking about maverick is.
Yellow i know for a fact maverick is not.
All yellow for a fact i put that in the.
Video thinking people would a hundred.
Percent take that as a joke because in.
The vlog i made it very clear that i'm.
Red green colorblind which by the way if.
You don't know what that means i'll.
Explain it in a second here this is you.
Time that was one second so a red-green.
Colorblind bait it's not like i can't.
See red or green colorblindness in.
General means when a bunch of colors.
That are like sort of the similar shade.
Are like next to each other and mesh.
Together to me it looks like a giant.
Blob anyways i said i said i thought.
Maverick was all yellow and people.
Believed me and that was that was a huge.
Point of attack for people i shouldn't.
Have said that.
I thought it was obvious that that was a.
Joke i guess i'm just like okay yeah.
First let me start by saying that whole.
Vlog i wanted to create an amazing story.
An amazing piece of content that first.
Started by showing like what it means to.
Be colorblind.
Testing the glasses seeing if they kind.
Of work and then ending on a beautiful.
Sunset and looking at it with the.
Glasses on just like any storyteller i.
Made it a i exaggerated my reactions and.
The colorblindness that's why people.
Thought that i was lying however i will.
Say this i did not lie i did not like.
What i did do is embellish there's a big.
Difference embellish is like and what i.
Was doing in that vlog is you heighten.
The circumstances or make something yeah.
Yeah exactly hi in the circus to see if.
I would war still.
You make something a little bit more fun.
A little bit more exciting but there is.
A core any root of truth to it.
Did it work be crying it's beautiful.
Like like life life happen and then as.
Far as my reaction goes where i actually.
Saw the sunset.
What those glasses did for me is they.
Accentuated the blues i've never i.
Legitimately had never seen the sunset.
That intense and that beautiful so it.
Was it was very easy for me to to get.
That reaction out of me like it my hands.
Down was the most beautiful sense that.
I've ever seen so that part wasn't fake.
Did i exaggerate a little bit yeah but.
Like dude no one wants to see a boring.
Story i'm a storyteller i'm annabelle.
Sure i'm a boost you might say there.
Embellished tips and polished it yes.
Brendi that's what i'm saying guys when.
I hit evan they're not real they're a.
Ballast sometimes i'm real no they're.
Not you're the one who hits me for real.
