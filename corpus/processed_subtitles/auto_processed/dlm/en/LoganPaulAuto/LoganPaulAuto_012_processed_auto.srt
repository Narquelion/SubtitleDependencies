You probably think you know me after all.
I pretty much lived my whole life on.
Camera.
You've been inside my house you see me.
Doing crazy    you know my friends my.
Family.
You see me at the top and you've.
Definitely seen me fall.
But the truth is you don't really know.
Me.
Way to go way to go you don't know.
What's inside my heart and you don't.
Know how hard i'm prepared to work or.
How far i'm prepared to go to achieve my.
Goals you have no idea what i'm capable.
Of.
But you're about to find out.
I saw a digital camera in a magazine.
When i was like 9 news $150 can afford.
That i'm nine years old and when i mowed.
Lawns i snowboard driveways i had a.
Birthday party so my friends were giving.
Me money i remember one of my friends.
Brought me $20 in pennies it's actually.
Him right there you're an.
$20 in pennies.
For some reason i like the aesthetic of.
Capturing something on a screen from 10.
To 18 we made videos jacob i and then.
Vaughn came out and we happen to pop off.
On that these uh stupid little six.
Second videos.
Hey who woulda guessed good night 88.
Music.
Logan's ability to story tell in such a.
Short form medium was super impressive.
Flipping that switch to go to youtube it.
Just took off from there he's fast this.
Channel that will reach a million.
Subscribers people were living.
Vicariously through him watching.
Billions of hours of content i st. logan.
As the biggest entertainer in the world.
Not a country that you can go in today.
Without him being known we're talking.
The biggest platform in the entire world.
Logan is number one for video views i.
Started on vine and then i became a.
Youtuber and.
A boxer this is weird and so i'm curious.
What i was like off-camera compared to.
Now yeah you know hello closed my house.
Is listed on google maps as a maverick.
House hey so this was a little out of.
The ordinary i don't know how these.
Things get in there i can assure you i'm.
Not manually putting my address into.
Google notion this house is a magnet for.
Crazies it's not just who knocks on the.
Door though we're sort of like a frat.
House but we're the most successful frat.
House in the world a chef cooking.
Full-time those guys coming in world.
Class box or anything that you could.
Possibly imagine.
As far as training rest recovery.
Scheduling to create a championship.
Boxing team we're doing that the first.
Case i fight watching him train and the.
Passion that he has for the sport i.
Think surprised him as much as it.
Surprised everyone else for me i'm a.
Long time boxing fan the rematch is kind.
Of the most exciting part of the whole.
Thing the intensity is just it's just.
Higher than it's ever been.
Everyone is stressed i'm stressed the.
Chef is stressed it's not the same when.
You wake up and it's fight camp.
Good morning champ we wake up every.
00.
In the morning.
Let's go champ look at him champ look at.
Him you got him.
It's the champ shannon - shannon briggs.
Two-time heavyweight champion of the.
World and guess what let's don't i go to.
Sleep every night nightmares about let's.
Go just go champ by bringing in shannon.
The stakes jumped up astronomically.
Right the energy changes with shannon.
He's just a powerful motivating energy.
Force and a two-time heavyweight world.
Champion that is extremely intelligent.
Animated i'm working loading like a.
Heavyweight champion but this is a.
Dangerous business and i tell them that.
Every day listen you can play football.
Play baseball but everything is you.
Can't play boxing this is the hurt.
Business man.
This    is real shannon is a great.
Coach because here's a great fighter.
He's been in the ring he is that warrior.
When he's screaming at you and telling.
You to do something look that rope.
You know it's from the point of view of.
Hey i've done this before and by the way.
It works.
Music.
This is the only reason i'm able to work.
Out as hard as i am i sort of god this.
Is it's better than cryotherapy it's.
Better than any massages any.
Anti-inflammatories this thing the ice.
Bath is a miracle chamber i've never.
Done ice dam i hate being cold.
It's like 38 degrees today i mean this.
Is hella cliche but this shit's all.
Mental i mean it really is if you can.
Like go somewhere else for the first 90.
Seconds you're in here and separate.
Yourself from your body like pull your.
Soul out and extract it you can get over.
It i think we're gonna peak right when.
The fight khans shanna calls it baking a.
Cake dudes baking a cake and he wants to.
Make sure it's cooked to perfection.
Oh wait mine's got this boat right now.
If any youtuber wants it you can come.
Get it say someone tweeted me like okay.
This guy ks eyes like jake paul logan.
Paul i knew kiss that was like a popular.
Youtuber some like whoa what's going on.
Here it allowed logan to focus all of.
His attention on a positive pursuit that.
Didn't have the residue of japan on it.
I've made a severe and continuous lapse.
Of my judgment and i don't expect to be.
Forgiven i'm simply here to apologize.
Post tokyo i had not forgiven myself.
Yeah and i was not ready to move on.
There's three million tweets trash logan.
Paul rot in hell without ksi calling me.
Out i don't know what i would have done.
If you hadn't given me an opportunity to.
Fight like go back to making cringy as.
Vlogs we kind of kept on thinking about.
It and i came up with the idea where.
Logan would fight ksi and then i would.
Fight deji his younger brother cuz i.
Think his younger brother started.
Talking    so we were like okay.
This fights happening we need to learn.
How to box i've never i've never boxed.
Before last year ever within 48 hours we.
Were in a boxing gym i've been hitting.
The paste by logan ball before and like.
It is not a joke at all.
A week later i'm sparring somebody.
Getting punched in the face like.
Bleeding but in our heads it's like we.
Can't lose like everybody in the world.
Wants jake and logan paul to lose i.
Don't think i knew how big the ksi fight.
Was gonna be the first time around it.
Was a massive massive thing that became.
The number one bought pay-per-view event.
On the internet system.
The kid can't box but he is a dog he is.
An animal and i respect the    out of.
That big ego a lot of pride refuses to.
Go down.
The draw the draw was a major letdown i.
Still think that he won the first fight.
Last year was the year of elle's for me.
Just taking elle's to the chin over and.
Over and over and over and over again in.
The fight i had against jj was my one.
Chance to secure some sort of win in.
2018 it was a    tie uh no i'm.
Gonna    kill this dude i'll rip.
His head off.
Music.
The colors of the wagon yeah.
Five minutes we're gonna bring those are.
The differences between the utah salinas.
And councilors this is really for your.
Trainers but i'm gpo's.
You guys can tell my demeanors a little.
More chills we've seen in the logan paul.
Vlogs i i'm uninterested in still being.
A youtuber this is not a gimmick anymore.
No i'm not joking around i'm a.
Professional fighter i'm gonna treat it.
Like that is that what made you want to.
Turn pro that way you can fight without.
The headgear use this moment though i.
Mean i just um pro sighs.
Kids got a big mouth.
Like me too which is why i think this is.
Such a big event like both our egos too.
Huge we both have a lot of the.
Line and none of us want to become a.
Mean.
Music.
Applause.
I think caves i was scared i think he.
Realizes that he's gonna loser knows.
That he's gonna lose deep deep deep down.
Who's excited to see me logan doesn't.
Like us are gonna get a    from.
Whatever promote haven't already come on.
Say it's a joke what is it eddie hearn.
Doing he's embarrassing you know etc etc.
But there'll also be watching on.
November 9 going fun the first time.
Around i got told about the first fight.
And i almost wanted it to be a paul fire.
It was a really good fight when i was.
Asked to be involved in the rematch.
I wasn't in any parts i knew it would.
Come with criticism they can criticize.
You and the event as much as one you're.
Still walking out you find it 20,000.
People that stay presented to fight.
Another men but with no protection i.
Said we need to lose the head cards you.
Got to use 10 ounce clubs the little.
Ones you know the ones that really crack.
Someone will end up face down here and.
Tie up and quite honestly that's what i.
Want now it's a proper file now someone.
Will get knocked out.
Quite honestly somebody's getting.
Knocked out and quite honestly that's.
What i want that's right.
Be me and eddie her and going at it self.
Aligning that's gonna be the new thing.
So i'm gonna do that for you you're.
Gonna be the first guy to wear it silver.
Lining yeah.
This shouldn't be allowed.
I sort of god this should not be allowed.
Last year would fought with 12 oz gloves.
And i know it doesn't seem like a lot.
With two ounces is gonna make a lifetime.
Of a difference.
Logan's punches in the first fight if.
They're ten ounce gloves would have.
Knocked him out oh my god these are.
Legal - yeah yeah yeah that's the same.
Thing - triple g uses that's the same.
One that some guys that used in i feel.
Like i'm holding a gun in my hands are.
Really quick and so if we're practicing.
An 18 ounce gloves and i'm looking fast.
Then and then we moved to ten ounce.
Gloves for fight i'm not even.
Considering the effects of a loss i just.
Can't i can't fathom it i think the.
Loser of this fight will suffer an.
Immense and perpetual amount of.
Embarrassment.
I'm an extreme person boxing is an.
Extreme sport every time you step in.
That ring you were risking your life.
Part of me sort of likes that as it.
Makes me push myself to a level and most.
Humans will never dare to go busting.
Your nose guess what becoming nuclear i.
Would never and million years want to.
Get in the ring the current fire look.
I'm scared for that side there will be a.
Knockout it's not going six rounds this.
Isn't some you to    i'm ready for.
This which is the only thing in my life.
That matters i'm gonna knock out his eye.
And it's gonna be sick.
What kind of man likes to beat up a man.
Trying to beat up him who enjoys that i.
Do i like that.
Next question.
Music.
You.
Music.
