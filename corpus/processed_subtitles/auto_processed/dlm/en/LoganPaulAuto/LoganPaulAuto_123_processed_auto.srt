I'll miss the thousands of miles of.
Memories with you you kept me safe you.
Kept me warm there's no way you're.
Crying right now so the girls were doing.
Some gardening with some hose a.
Gardening tool and they found this giant.
Bug here dude this thing is massive.

Though will you eat this bug for $100.
It's crunchy oh my god oh my god there's.
Remnants of bug congratulations your.
$200 rooster nothing to say a couple of.
Vlogs go jake jumped in this little pond.
Right here or puddled pond pippin have.
You look now it's full of like wood mud.
Sand i don't know what i've set him in.
But now i have reason to believe this.
Could be quicksand there's only one way.
To find out guys i don't think this is.
Quicksand i dig your back i think it is.
Quick saying it's quicksand here's the.
Deal we drove a bunch up to the ranch.
This weekend and this like nice bar.

Not gonna pay you $200 and you only.
Actually have a good idea how.
You killed that big snake real prank is.
Hoping to plant it on the ground and.
Then hopefully scare the    holy.
Snake wrangling this the first.
Time we ever came to the ranch.
Cheapy fought a rattlesnake to the death.

Dogs or something behind you right right.

Old one is real oh he's been kind enough.
To let me roll it off a cliff and then.

Prepared a eulogy.
Nice nice do my jeep whoo i've spent.
Seven faithful years with you've been my.
First love my first adventure buddy and.
There's so much that i'll miss about you.
I'll miss the aggressive sound when you.
Start if you start in the sound of the.
Mysterious piece of metal that clanks as.
I drive you i'll miss that i can't go.
Over 60 miles an hour unless you warm up.
First i'll miss the garden hose used as.
A replacement part in the radiator and.
I'll miss the way that the floor fills.
Up with water when it rains but most of.
All i'll miss the thousands of miles of.
Memories with you you kept me safe you.
Kept me warm there's no way you're.
Crying.
We don't have to do this teary eye - i'm.
Not good you kept me safe kept me warm.
You took me places and you're always up.
For an adventure may this last memory be.
As crazy as the rest.
Music.

Applause.
No i mean like do we just shoot it and.
Leave it on the hill forever.
Music.
