You know obviously the first thing you.
See when you come up is honor but every.
Star represents one of the guys that.
Were killed in the community this.
Memorial is dedicated to all those guys.
That have been fighting in the shadows.
Never asked for recognition never wanted.
Any anything they don't want to pat on.
The back they just want to do their job.
And most of these guys step up on a.
Daily basis and they care about this.
Country they care about everybody in it.
They care about the freedoms that we.
Have they look at one of these stars i.
Knew a lot of these guys and i think.

Dedicated and passionate this is this is.
A circumstance that is comes few and far.
