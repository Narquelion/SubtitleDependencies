Dear shane dawson i tweeted this before.
The series was out when the teaser was.
Released i said don't underestimate hard.
Work trains teaser just turned into or.
Did first off i love what i'm seeing i.
Love it shane you are an amazing content.
Creator you are changing the game you.
Are paving the landscape of what could.
Be the future of youtube and shane knows.
This i i'm friends with shane i'm.
Cordial with him we dm today it was.
Romantic and but when i'm watching this.
Series there's just a few things i.
Thought i was trying to stay out of it.
By i want i need to address them because.
Shane the people are watching this.
You're young and impregnable audience.
You're young and impenetrable audience.
You're young and impressionable audience.
Will not know any better so i'm here to.
Cut that    once again makes a whistle.
Noise when i drink that's the first.
Stuff like i said i think information is.
Being told in a way that is extremely.
Misleading and that's what i'm here to.
Clarify also i get that not everyone.
Likes my brother and me included like.
The paul family is just currently.
Surrounded by controversy a fault of our.
Own plot but he made a comment in.
Episode one that just tickled me the.
Wrong way cuz i could like i know he's a.
Good dude.
And that's why this content works cuz.
Everything he's doing is so genuine and.
Authentic and you will watch this dude.
For 45 minutes straight who's doing that.
On youtube no one and you gotta like him.
Too.
He's a likable guy for the record by the.
Way shane also said in episode two logan.
I feel like it's more likable.
Thanks man i'm going off on a tangent.
Ways in episode 1 right at the beginning.
As he's setting the stage he said this i.
Thought it was just cringing you know.
Yeah that's all i can might be logan i.
Didn't know they were different i don't.
Know why you said that cuz you know.
That's not true i think it was cuz it's.
Very easy to also hop on the train of.
Like i don't like the polls he's one of.
The biggest youtubers in the world like.
He knows who you guys are not only that.
About two years ago i hung out with.
Shane for like an hour and half i did.
His.
Podcast you're gonna start did it start.
Odd oh i was on his podcast shane and.
Friends featuring logan paul i think we.
Sat in the same room and talked for like.
An hour so either a you're not telling.
The truth be you forgot who i am.
Amnesia classic classic youtube brand or.
C like i said it's it immediately gets.
People on board to be like oh you're.
Right i didn't even know there's two.
Maybe i anyways he said this and i.
Started to not doubt but immediately i.
Was like well how much of this will be.
Truthful but again i'm going on a.
Tangent the original point i'm trying to.
Say is shane you you are scaring your.
Young and interminable honey you are.
Scaring your young and independence day.
Audiences like this whole a second.
Episode is just suspense music and then.
The b-roll the b-roll where did you buy.
This b-roll.
Did you get this stock footage that is.
Not getting i would love to see your.
Search history human eats human out of.
Hands.
Why are you doing cannibalism who's the.
Sociopath man series is making me ask so.
Many questions no but this is this leads.
Into the point of what i want to say to.
That is actually educational the meat of.
This video that you guys can stick in.
The back of your mind from when you're.
Watching the rest of the series the.
Buzzword that shane is focusing on in.
The reason why he's sitting down at this.
Therapist house who also offered in the.
Drink is sociopath so she's a sociopath.
So she sociopath sociopath again before.
I say anything guys i dm shane about.
This i gave him my opinions because i.
It's quite simply it is not black and.
White.
99% of the time someone is not a.
Sociopath or not a sociopath my opinion.
Is there's a sociopathic spectrum at.
Which point some people lie higher on it.
Than others and by the way some of the.
Biggest businessmen in the world could.
Be considered sociopathic mark jobs no.
Steve zuckerberg mark zuckerberg and.
Steve jobs a lot of people especially.
Youtubers and shane touched on this you.
Can't just say like you're a sociopath.
The word i would like to use is.
Sociopathic tendencies so a lot of us me.
Included.
We'll do some dumb    be some stuff.
That lacks empathy strictly for views.
Right it gets us views which gets us.
Subscribers a motivating factor is to.
Reach the next next next level sociopath.
Is boil down someone who is just more.
Savage than everyone else i know it.
Sounds stupid but i'm making it easier.
For you to understand cuz the way a.
Sociopath was described in part 2 of the.
Series quite honestly could be applied.
To most people someone even tweeted at.
Shane i need a voice of concern ashley.
And dawson this isn't a call-out but how.
Much thought was put into the idea that.
After a video like your latest that any.
Awkward kid including ones with.
Disabilities could be labeled a.
Sociopath due to your audience's.
Youthful and experience and another.
Person said if you think about it like.
Deep down doesn't everybody fit the.
Scription they gave four sociopaths i.
Feel like most people i know are that.
Way and don't even try very hard to hide.
It yeah like it's so hard to say and the.
Big sticking point i'm having with it.
Shane i feel like is trying to make out.
A sociopath to be synonymous with.
Psychopaths the words sound very similar.
But mean very different things and again.
For the young and interpret all audience.
They will confuse the two and think.
Psychopathy means sociopath.
Not the case in fact in shane's video.
Itself hillel say the word and then show.
The word psychopathy i want to talk to a.
Psychologist if he is a sociopath hey.
Everybody today i want to talk to you.
About the word psychopathy and i want to.
Make that clear because even in shane's.
Video itself there's a couple times.
Where he will say the word sociopath but.
Show something psychopathic or even show.
The word psychopathy i heard steve jobs.
I don't care about that i heard steve.
Jobs was a sociopath yet the thing says.
With steve jobs of psychopaths what say.
Yes you're confusing people and the.
Reason i'm so intrigued and feel.
Compelled to say something about this is.
Because at the beginning of the year i'm.
Gonna open up here for a sec you guys.
Can imagine tons of people even people.
In my circle close friends like yo your.
Sociopaths straight up and i didn't know.
What the word met cuz i like is it a.
Psychopath is that what it is so i.
Looked it up and i had to ask myself i'm.
Like oh sociopaths and for sure some.
Things i fit the description of that's.
Why i'm saying i prefer if we're gonna.
Label jake a sociopath or not doing it.
On a spectrum and where he lies on it.
Because again it's not just black and.
White to quote the great aristotle.
There's levels to this so is shane a.
Sociopath i don't know he's like clearly.
I don't want to say forcing but these.
Reactions seem a little socio-economic.
You know this bro i love you this is a.
Classic case of dramatics.
On youtube yo logan i left your car keys.
On the counter i don't know bro he's a.
Genuine authentic guy but i get i feel.
Like some of this is slightly theatrical.
Cuz i just don't think this reaction.
Elicits itself in every sentence like.
You see that easily jarred in real life.
Like by simple things well last time say.
I've met him what did when you shook his.
Hand was he like but 10% of me 10% of.
That shane was existent just like bro.
You mean me in real life like i'm pretty.
Calm like whatever but i have that part.
Of me it's like but does that make me a.
Sociopath according to this therapist.
Check it then they also are impulsive if.
I was impulsive i would use that clever.
Pun because my last name is paul.
Impulsive and create a podcast coming.
Sooo to a screen near you i'm also not.
Wearing pants does that make me a.
Sociopath i have a    pig this.
Video it's not black and white.
Sociopathic to be quite honest with you.
It's nothing to be like scared of like.
If your friend might be a sociopath or.
Has sociopathic tendencies he's not.
Gonna stab you in the middle of the.
Night when you're not looking i don't.
Think cuz what if he's a sociopath an.
Aside then you plenty simple you look.
I'm excited for the rest of this series.
I literally have no idea what it's about.
Or where it's going as much as i love.
Jake we don't talk like normal brothers.
Do i think as much as we should our.
Family's a bit that if you couldn't tell.
But i think that wraps up today's vlog.
If you're not a part of the look yeah.
