Months completely transformed into some.
Utterly world creature you got two guys.
Two villains with the biggest egos in.
The world the biggest pride in the world.
We're subscribers money clout fame and.
They actually know how to fight this is.
Not a gimmick anymore i'm no longer a.
Youtuber right now i'm a professional.
Fighter i'm gonna treat it like that.
People die in this sport this is a.
Dangerous sport i'm not gonna go to war.
Without my weapons and to get those.
Weapons takes years of training.
Dedication passion so i don't think the.
Average creator can do that this is this.
Is a second chance.
Applause.
Music.
Can i be honest with you guys yes please.
I'm not in the mood jokes today i'm not.
I'm not in a good mood i'm not at all.
Last year the press conference like.
Before you know we had the big party bus.
We had the whole squad of people.
Everyone was getting so high last year i.
Was a youtuber first and a showman first.
I wanted to put on a good show i wanted.
To look good this year i'm a boxer first.
So i'm treating it like that and i'm so.
Mentally just as zoned in right now the.
Fight is won today if i can get in his.
Head which i know i can and just seep.
Beneath that small that it thinks all.
That is ksi i think this is the.
Beginning of the end of our friend jj.
Evan what do you think about all this i.
Feel good.
Oh shh the secret weapon.
Haha hey how much is this watch probably.
300 k yo yo put a richer million i've.
Not had no idea how i got i could figure.

Applause.
Good opponent the nightmare kazar.
Applause.
Music.
That bro i said it this morning she it's.
Like a job to me i'm trying to be i'm.
Trying to be as locked in as possible.
And he comes out with some that was the.
Weakest of her do nothing bro i told him.
I told her to his face i'm like bro.
Nothing what happened you were so good.
Last year everything you said was funny.
In a hit oh he's making like drake jokes.
Well i'm so disappointed i'm so mad.
Right now watch the kids demeanor the.
Whole fight watch the way he sits in his.
Chair he slouches i'm up talking    to.
His face talking about his family trying.
To trigger him a little bit and he gives.
Me nothing he talked more about me than.
You nothin ever in sporting history have.
I seen someone that is so bad and.
Trashed.
He was good last year he was do trust go.
Do it good like still at the bottom but.
This year dude he little son you know.
Why you know why you know why you know.
Why you know why he's gonna lose cuz i'm.
Next controversial you got nothing.
Bro oh man watching knock this man out i.
Already won i already won i'm gonna kill.
Him okay that was yesterday i've had 24.
Plus hours to sort of decompress a lot.
Of    was said in the press conference.
My opinion i got a little out of hand i.
Went somewhere that unfortunately i.
Didn't want to be mentally and i'll.
Explain that i'm gonna sort of give you.
Guys a play-by-play of what was going.
Through my mind i will say everything.
That i said was true starting off with.
Even just seeing jj because mind you i.
Haven't seen the kid physically in.
Person for a year the last time we were.
Locked in a 20 by 20 foot square.
Literally just beating the    out of.
Each other i was excited to see what i.
Would feel like when i was when i was.
Face-to-face with him again i wish i.
Could say i felt something when i saw.
Him there was no apprehension there was.
No it was just a pure sense of.
Domination.
And when i looked in his eyes not only.
Could i see the fear on him his eye was.
Still bleeding from the last fight if.
You all remember post august 25th the.
Kid had a blood vessel popped on his eye.
I think from a couple of my jab and when.
I was looking at him he had a brown spot.
Where the blood vessels were pop and as.
Soon as i saw that i got crazy confident.
Cuz i was like yo this was from a year.
And a half ago and i've scarred this kid.
I've left him something that's gonna be.
With him for the rest of his life the.
Kid is gonna look in the mirror and to.
Be reminded of me that was with head.
Guards and 12 ounce gloves with no head.
Guards yo oh so then the press.
Conference started and i hate to say.
This but before it started i tweeted.
Time to do what i do best and that is.
Quite honestly when i want to flip the.
Switch be an    like i can be an.
Applause.
And this press conference is that it.
Kind of sucks because this press.
Conference is like the epitome of the.
Worst version of myself the one that.
Just prods and pokes and is a little.
Cringe and it's just yelling and.
Screaming and saying mean stuff but then.
Again that's my job i feel like as an.
Entertainer as a boxer and my job to.
Sell tickets and move product i'm here.
To put on a show you don't have to like.
Me you can hate me i'd rather you hate.
Me than feeling different about me but.
At least you feel something and you're.
Out there gonna come and watch me beat.
The    out of the kid or you're gonna.
Come watch me to go watch you mean to.
Watch me to watch me get beat up i don't.
Know what happened there know we're.
Sitting here and eddie hearn is talking.
And i'm like yo this like my opponent is.
Sitting four feet from me why would i.
Not turn to my right and just start.
Saying some    so some dude handed me.
A cup of of ice water.
I took the ice and he got mad the team's.
Kind of gotten a little bit of a scuffle.
But you know i'm such a    punk.
Dude and i know it i've been away from.
This kid for a year and a half and he's.
Right there and i'm fighting him like.
Why not just prod him a little bit so.
Then shannon briggs.
By the way who's my coach two-time.
Heavyweight champ of the world goes.
Right for the biggest guy he can find he.
Goes yo dude big guy yo and shannon.
Briggs is in your corner one as a coach.
Is incredible two as a bodyguard i don't.
Care how big you are.
Shannon will disrespect shannon will.
Hurt you bro he will say let's go champ.
To your face let's go over and over.
Again and over again and do it then some.
More let's go champ.
So then they let our coaches speak.
Shannon went up there he said some stuff.
Let's go chat and then vidale who's que.
Sighs coach he went up there and he.
Started talking he goes up there and.
Shannon goes i don't know if y'all y'all.
Got this he's like he let wrote a speech.
He had notes in the same if it all comes.
Up there with notes in his hand and i.
Looked i was like he's just dude about.
To like give a speech like it's not your.
Day so i start talking to food all he's.
Up there and i'm like go like what do.
You do to make youtube videos are you a.
Boxing coach and he actually ended up.
Getting booed off like no one wanted him.
There anymore.
Music.
Then i go up there it's my turn to talk.
I don't feel like staying in one.
Position it's not my thing i like to.
Walk around i like to be mobile and so i.
Go to remove this mic and a few people.
Might have noticed this if you hit me in.
The head.
All right listen soon as they hit me in.
That i was like no this is not to do a.
Good start but you could see i pull it.
Yank it up and it just comes right down.
And like hits me i was like in case i am.
Good all notice and they started.
Laughing starte and minds you guys i.
Have no monologue prepared when they.
Told me it was open format i'm like yo.
Okay i don't know what this like do i.
Just stand out there and talk and be a.
Bully first like the goal is obviously.
To piss the kid off but there's no.
Question there's just like i go speak.
About what dude the first thing i go for.
Obviously is deji the brother who.
Disowned him where's that yet where the.
Is that yet where's your family at.
I like responding to ksi better like.
Last year he said so many things and i.
Wasn't quite as quick and witty as i am.
Now i think actually partially because.
Of the podcast talking on impulsive at.
Length has made me much better at being.
Able to respond real-time and so i don't.
Really know what i'm doing here i.
Thanked his parents for birthing him so.
I could be dishing out of him.
Mr. and mrs. ksi thank you for giving me.
The opportunity to beat the    out of.
Your    son and by the way i stand.
By that like thank you guys i would love.
To give you a gift card of some sort.
Take you out to dinner sometime i told.
The kid he smelled like herpes so what.
Do you hope you smell like if jj had any.
Brain even the smallest amount he would.
Have said yo how do you know what herpes.
Smell like and then it would be like no.
Mr. shott there and you go miss your.
Shot in the ring boy that was the.
Cheesiest thing i've ever said if i'm.
Being honest with you he didn't he.
Didn't smell like herpes he smelled.
Bonala herpes baby take it off take it.
Off.
Cuz your super glue tt uh-huh that was.
Your wig bro so i started getting.
Confused here cuz he was saying that was.
That was my weight he was telling me to.
Take off his bandana and then i was.
Saying last year if you guys remember at.
That press conference last year i tried.
The bandana i ripped off the wig and.
Then i tried to take off the bandana it.
Was super glued to his head so yeah i.
Got super confused i started to question.
Everything around me i was like yo this.
Is a space crime time continuum broken.
Cuz i could have swore could've sworn i.
Ripped the wig off real easily and then.
The bandana was the thing i couldn't get.
Wow by the way your own your brother.
Said i'm gonna win this fight hey that.
Is true that is true deji his own.
Brother said i had the edge in this.
Fight no good has an edge i don't know.
What isn't connecting with people when.
They say that they think ksi is gonna.
Win this fight cuz i see a lot of the.
Twitter pulls and stuff and ksi is.
Actually he's the favorite right now.
Technically i'm the underdog which i'm.
Totally cool with i love being the.
Underdog but i don't get it.
It's cool though it's a cool opportunity.
Your suit is nice your suit is usami on.
Every doll at this point cuz every time.
This do poster youtube videos are you.
Doing maybe this is why your pupil looks.
Like a fine meatball i don't know.
Wherever dolls been if he's out making.
Youtube videos but how many times can.
You put me in a video before you realize.
Like yo you should probably focus on.
Making your kid the best athlete you can.
Your suit is loops get a better tailor.
You gotta pay more oh my god i just.
Realized maybe that's why i don't show.
Up maybe that's why you got this brick.
Of a man holding pads for jj.
And not vidale so that this was funny.
But vidale had to encourage jj to go he.
Said go get him jj go go do your best.
Job so this was cool with jj walked up.
Finally i'm like yo i don't have to just.
Start holding    from my ass i can.
Respond which is what i do best.
That's it before i talk about you logan.
I want to talk about j let's talk about.
A chain rule quick that's your opening.
Your opening is yo let's talk about jake.
Where's the jj from last year where's.
The jd who brought the props he had the.
Wig and everything i wanted that jj and.
The first thing he says was let's talk.
About jake and i can see why i think.
Jake made him upset when in our first.
Face to face jake came up to jj and blew.
Smoke in his face.
Nice yo this dudes talking about.
Spelling i like it for those you don't.
Know what semantics mean it's the branch.
Of linguistics concerning with meaning.
So i'm like what the    is this kid.
Saying he's talking about like a.
Spelling of the word    my brother's.
Youtube video.
Yo lock-in dude like get your head in.
The game right now mentally i'm telling.
You he's not there he hasn't been there.
For the past year and a half look at the.
Pictures of us from the last fight the.
One we're both holding in the belt i'm.
There i'm smiling what a great first.
Boxing event huh we did good.
Jayjay not even present you're a plan is.
And are off the 405 i'll wait you after.
In there i'll wait till you after it.
I'll wait.
I'm really trying to understand i'll.
Wait till you i'll wait to you after.
This okay literally like i just told him.
His breasts samin like herpes then he.
Told me my breath smell 4500 miles.
That's how far you flew from london to.
America to steal my jokes and talk to my.
Brother no i don't know about all this.
They say looking good for you dog i'm so.
Sorry i didn't know you were there oh we.
Knew the kong jokes were coming there's.
No rebuttal there's no response.
It just said like you ruin my day you.
Ruin my day did you good job dude good.
Job i hope you're happy.
I missed that little dog they started.
Making noises you're up you go so.
Confident doctor beat your ass and i was.
With take a picture with drake post it.
On social media.
I'd still win it bro what are you yeah.
Not funny that's the joke you flew 4500.
Miles to make that joke i'm like yo.
Drake's not gonna take a picture with.
You.
Ever nood my musical you don't know you.
Couldn't sell on a 50-person venue in.
Your own country so that that was me.
Just getting under his skin because he.
Went on this music tour while i was.
Training this past year at half a if you.
Guys didn't know this he was on tour and.
Some of the venues were so small and not.
Sold out and as an artist that is one of.
The most embarrassing things ever his.
Music videos cost hawley between fifty.
And two hundred thousand dollars each.
And they get like what two two two to.
Eight million views let's just say jj's.
Music career is not probably going the.
Way he wants it to i put my hands okay.
So first of all you look like you're.
Running with a dildo up your ass what's.
Wrong with having a dildo up your ass.
Shout out to jordy where'd your.
Personality go like a easy.
Hey jj has no dick i reached a point.
Where i realized like after he sat down.
Even just the way he's seated he's kind.
Of slouched over like this body language.
Experts will tell you it's a defeated.
Demeanor everything about him had just.
Sort of given up and and by the way i.
Actually kind of get this if you all.
Remember in the press conference last.
Year when i went to england i sat down.
You could see my face i was kind of sad.
I didn't really want to be there i.
Wasn't having the best day ever i was.
Kind of tired and that's what happened.
If you remember i literally just left.
Because i was like this i don't want to.
Be here and i i sensed that a little bit.
With him here so then this is where the.
Infamous jj has no dick part came in jj.
Has no dick change it has no dick at.
This moment that i knew this    is.
This press conference as god to shout.
Out my mom for really making this.
Segment come around momma paul hands for.

Makes so my eyes now at this point he's.
Defeated he's not giving me much to work.

Giving it to me is it over already.
I want to sit what are you doing but.
Give me something dude just weak dude so.
Finally they put us together at the end.
And i had one more opportunity to make.
It make something happen here so i get.
Up i get in his face a little bit and.
Easy man easy man to move i tweeted this.
Easy man to move i pushed him i barely.
Put any effort into him he goes back.
Like two feet and i didn't want it to.
End there brother like i'm a little bit.
Of a sick father like i wanted to get in.
His mind a little bit so i took off his.
Glasses and now we're face to face i can.
See that that mark on his eye again and.
I'm raquel i got a little heated here.
Your eyes.
I thought at one point i was like yo.
This dude's about to kiss me right now i.
Was cool with it.
No i'm just kidding no i'm not and that.
He looked a little hot right so like i.
Was just looking out for him i i blew on.
His face i hooked him up so he hooked me.
Up back he blew on my face we're calling.
Each other off no problem i guess you.
Could say we just started blowing each.
Other and then at one point i started.
Crying.
What are sweating out of my eyes or.
Something i don't know why do you.
Remember that happening look it was a.
Hot day okay and sometimes yeah i sweat.
On my eyes    you so do witches we're.

Invisible penis and then like humping.
The air and it's over and i'm like yo.

What just happened why was it like that.
And then i see this video of ksi talking.
After the press conference and the dude.

Girls i hook up with and i'm not body.
Shaming him but actually i absolutely am.
You're like 55 days get it together.

Shot i've tried to be extremely real.
With you guys after that day my.
Confidence even more so than it already.
Has.
As skyrocket i don't know if he's.
Satisfied with the amount of money that.
He's made from this fight or what but.
That fire that jj had last year that ksi.
That i thought last year was gone that.
Kid was gone.
Dead and gone the kid i'm fighting now.
Feels like he thinks he should be.
Working hard and he should say certain.
Things to offend me there's no substance.
There the wall was was broke down way.
Way way too easily so yeah i hope he.
Loses sleep every day knowing that i'm.
Working harder than him knowing that i.
Have more valuable assets on my team to.
Him knowing that i'm also working.
Smarter than him everything about our.
Training camp is so much better than his.
