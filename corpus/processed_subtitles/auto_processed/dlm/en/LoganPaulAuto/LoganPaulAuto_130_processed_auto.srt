Challenge than you expected okay well.

It like a post mate's thing where you.
See the order like dominos or something.

Logan gave up lost the fight.
This sure is good let's talk about.
Expectations versus reality we came here.
With expectations we started the day.
With the expectations you did your first.
Run with certain expectations and your.
First run was horrible.
Nothing short of horrible it was.
Horrible against what logan paul was.
Capable of what if you just got better.
At maneuvering the obstacles no i'm not.
Saying he did tim i want to juggle so.
Shut your mouth mike i'm not talking to.
You we didn't break you yet you're not.
Broken but you were beat the next run.
When we start mixing a gun into it it's.
Gonna really challenge you because i.
Don't want you throwing my gun around in.
The mud i don't want you pointing in a.
Direction it shouldn't be pointed i.
Don't want you shooting in a direction.
You shouldn't be shooting.
I don't want your finger on a trigger.
When it shouldn't be on the trigger just.
Warm you what does he even look like to.

You're tired and you know how you were.
Sucking wind he's sucking wind same way.
You were down on your knees and he kept.
Saying don't go down on your knees why.
Is he saying don't go down on your knees.
I can't be in the fight if this is what.

That burger well not no way we're.
Supposed to have a nice david david.
Bendeth our respective sand water and.
You're gonna do two laps logan paul when.
He came here this morning was concerned.
About logan paul was concerned about.
Himself he was talking about how he had.
The flu and that's what was defeating.
Him on the first run it was physically.
Challenging but that's not what did it.
Do him it was all mental but when you've.
Been through difficult things physically.
It alters what you think you're capable.
Of you know everything so our strategy.
Going forward based on what we saw in.
That last run of logan we're gonna take.
It up another notch there are more.
Things yet that he hasn't done that will.
Be incorporated into what he's just done.
How's it possible that i miss ya it must.
Be different for you nice toss top bro.
Ready for it yep it was tough at the.
Beginning for logan it got easier.
Towards the middle now comes to the end.
And the end there's gonna be way harder.
What do you got what do you got in that.
Window.
The gnostic we're putting all our skills.
Together right we learn how to shoot we.
Learn how to do the obstacle course.
Hopefully it goes well.
Something tells me it's not though this.
Vest is like at least probably a hundred.
Pounds this gun is probably 300 pounds.
Just a lot of extra added weight to my.
Body that is gonna make this extremely.
Extremely difficult there's nothing i.
Don't know how to do at this point.
Bad they couldn't train you how to win.
Up boxing match should we leave those.
