Comment below hit that subscribe button.
And i yes enjoy it this one is my first.
Time making out sick believe it or not i.
Was quite shy as a kid i didn't hang.
With the boys in my grade because i just.
Didn't get along with them as well as i.
Got along with the girls and this was.
About 8th grade so the time that.
Everyone was going through that awkward.
Puberty staged the girls were like.
Taller than the boys every kid named.
Adam had a mustache like oh god what a.
Time to be alive now this was also the.
Time with boys and girls and sometimes.
Boys and boys and sometimes and girls.
And girls would start touching tongues i.
Thought making out was the weirdest.
Thing ever i didn't really see what the.
Point was but the peer pressure to start.
Lip-locking with someone was too much.
For young logan everyone else was making.
Out why hadn't i done it yet and then i.
Realized maybe it's because the girls.
Had all friends on me and they were.
Taller than me and preferred adam with.
The mustache and then who talked to me.
About how their makeout session was and.
I'm listening like what the    how did.
I put myself in this position well lucky.
For me about halfway through the year a.
New girl got transferred to our school.
Let's call her kelly she was really.
Pretty and super cool and we ended up.
Bonding in study hall because she liked.
Drawing pictures of kitchens and i.
Happened to like looking at pictures of.
Kitchen to is a match made in heaven.
Soon enough we were dating which in.
Eighth grade doesn't mean anything but.
We thought we were in love because we.
Both liked kitchens and i don't know i.
Guess it's weird saying it out loud now.
But it made sense back then so one day.
I'm talking all my girlfriend's who had.
All made friends with kelly and they.
Popped the question hello you know what.
Are you gonna make hell with her and in.
My head i'm like oh.
About that man this is stupid i'm.
Nervous i don't even know how to make.
Out she's taller than me and why does.
That relationship have to be validated.
By our dogs of course i played it cool i.
Told the girls uh tonight at the party.
Obviously and they're all like oh my.
Gosh we're gonna tell kelly i'm a girl.
But it was too late.
Kelly and i had a make-out date at the.
Party that night.
So i can home and immediately hop.
On youtube how to make out and for three.
Hours watch weird adults teach me how to.
Touch tongues with another human being.
One of which is actually this video oh.
Weird anyways i get to the party.
And i'm locked and loaded basically a.
Makeout master and kelly is standing.
There fresh chapstick on oh.
So i give my battle call i marched right.
Up to kelly and i say can i talk to you.
Upstairs sure you march upstairs my.
Heart is pounding out of my chest so i.
Give a second battle call but quietly.
Into myself and i say kelly hey do we.
Really have to do this right now and.
She's like wait you don't want to make.
Out with me no no i do i just i don't.
Want to be pressured to do it you know.
Like we should do it one more ready yeah.
But we love logan but kelly the only.
Real thing we have in common is that we.
Like kitchen oh kelly i kind of feel.
Weird and we start sucking face i'm.
Using all the skills i learned from the.
Youtube videos and i'm not sure like.
Whether i'm supposed to keep my eyes.
Open or closed and at one point kelly.
And i made direct eye contact and we're.
Just staring at each other she's like.
Licking my gums i'm trying not to choke.
On my own tongue and after the most.
Awkward 30 seconds of my life it was.
Over thank god.
Wow that was amazing yeah.
Truly remarkable kelly goes skipping.
Downstairs happy as a clam and i'm left.
In the garage alone and confused next.
Day the girls rush me like a herd of.
Cattle good and i had to be honest right.
So i just said ah i don't know it to be.
Honest it seemed kind of forced and i'm.
Not sure i really get the point of.
Making out so she wasn't good no no she.
Was good i guess like i don't know what.
Does that even mean just leave me alone.
Please and all the girls left that was.
Once again left alone and confused.
One hour later kelly finds me in study.
Hall holds up a picture of a kitchen.
Rips it in half so making out with me.
With pointless what no i just was i i.
Don't know kelly i just wasn't ready.
Even though i thought it was due to my.
Hours of youtube preparation i breaking.
Up with you i don't love you anymore.
Music.
That was once again left alone and.
Confused my heart was broken not really.
But it still sucked and for that reason.
I did not kiss another girl for two.
Years listen do not rush into.
Relationships you will end up staring at.
Your crush in the eyes when you're.
Playing tonsil hockey and you'll be.
Emotionally scarred for the rest of your.
Life facts.
Music.
