I need that.
I need that in my life oh was he doing.
That.
Yo this is so cute.
Music.
Music.
I just want to own this dog and their.
Happily forever after how much for the.
Dog.
Yo yo dog for 5 minutes and we are.
Music.
Here we are this is it.
I hate these videos every single one you.
Sit down and you talk to a camera about.
Some sesh that just happened the.
Unexpected videos but i believe i owe it.
To you guys to talk about what happened.
Because kong the savage as you know.
Played a huge part in my life these past.
Two years i'm gonna try not to get.
Emotional but it's just it's this was.
Very unexpected it's it's incredibly sad.
Everyone in the house there's their.
Heart is hurting today and we've heard.
Reports of coyotes in the neighborhood.
Neighbor susie is always like texting us.
When the the neighborhood gets an email.
About some sort of coyote wash mitt.
Whether it's a street over or somewhere.
In the city i just feel like it's one of.
Those things where it's impossible to.
Happen until it happens to you which is.
What happened last night.
I took a moment to think about how i.
Wanted to make this video obviously.
Because anything involving death given.
My past is gonna be a bit tender and.
Difficult to navigate and as a content.
Creator.
I wanted to let this one digest a bit so.
I could really collect my feelings.
Before i drove into it.
Yesterday was a weird day in general if.
You guys follow me on instagram you.
Probably saw the story we're in.
Pterodactyl type bird came into my koi.
Pond and actually killed one of my fish.
And didn't kill it for consumption.
Literally just killed the fish it's.
Almost like all these bad things happen.
At one time i don't know what it is if.
It's like a universal like queue to me.
Or what it is but anyways i'm at dinner.
Later that night my neighbor susie.
Texted me and she says coyote in front.
Keep calling inside and i said where and.
So i i screened shot this and i send it.
To my boys who are at home andre and.
Mike so andre might go out to look for.
Kong and it's the classic group chat.
Panic where everyone's starts to freak.
Out because not only do they not hear.
Him which is unusual but they don't see.
Him running around the yard either kong.
Just ran away before guys if you're like.
Oh gee lo gang you know kong has ran out.
The gate like three times before.
We got a fence to stop him but he's a.
Like a little adventure dog so.
Who knows maybe he was somewhere in the.
Bushes or somewhere in the trees but as.
Time went on and they're sending me.
Videos of them looking for kong i.
Started to worry a little more mind you.
I'm at dinner i'm looking at the the.
Security cameras but it's so loud and i.
Can't really see what's going on somehow.
I i'm at this freaking crowded.
Restaurant beverly hills and i'm on the.
Kick security cam footage and i see one.
Of the biggest coyotes i've ever seen in.
My life and i'm from ohio like i i grew.
Up around coyotes i know what they look.
Like and one of them is just stalking.
Right outside the gate just lurking and.
You you know you heard kong bark a.
Couple times and then i saw a second.
Coyote like equally the same size and.
These    are bad they are.
Aggressive they've killed dogs in our.
Neighborhood before and they're right up.
Against the gate and so i'm starting to.
Freak out i am the one in the group with.
The level head but i'm at dinner with my.
Friend and i'm looking around i started.
To get a little antsy and we're all.
Hoping so badly that we go outside the.
Gate and we just see kong sitting atop a.
Dead coyote tongue hanging low chest out.
Oh i gotta kill boys but it just seemed.
A little far-fetched and then i get the.
Call from andre and mike they're like yo.
You got to come home we have really bad.
News so i got my 30-minute drive home.
And i'm freaking on the car and i'm.
Asking i'm like yo ii like it where's.
The body is he potentially still alive.
Somewhere what they do.
And andres showed me the the footage.
When i got home and i can't like coyotes.
Are so slick i can't help but feel like.
This was premeditated like this is the.
Most cunning abduction plan i've seen in.
My days the whole thing lasted about 10.
To 15 seconds the coyote jumped the.
Fence shay's kong around a car and.
Grabbed him actually right here the.
Coyote took kong there there's.
No remains like they straight-up.
Abducted him.
And like i said like these    are.
So.
Man i don't like not like this i hate.
Making these videos he didn't stand a.
Chance and i hate how naive he is and so.
Mindless like he had no idea what was.
Going on like he was on the other side.
Of the gate literally barking at the.
Coyotes taunting them and he's never.
Really had any taste of danger he.
Doesn't have any predators here so we.
Didn't know what we didn't know what to.
Do and again i just want to iterate how.
How quick all of this happened and so we.
Searched the whole neighborhood for.
About an hour we spent the whole morning.
Looking for anything we could find and.
There is nothing there's literally no.
Sign of him and these coyotes are still.
Out there and we still have more pets.
Like we have perl the pig we have raya.
I mean if give one snuck into my room we.
Got maverick and who knows what these.
These things are capable of at this.
Point you know they pulled the.
Heist of a century they literally.
Snagged the most famous and loved dog on.
Instagram i have had kong since almost.
Since i like started vlogging and during.
Our search last night by the grace of.
Mother nature the universe some sort of.
Magical ether we go and in mind you i'm.
Gonna show you he was he was literally.
Snatched right over there and right.
There when we're looking for him.
Yesterday we find a little tennis ball.
Little chewed up tennis ball and this do.
You see is this like real life right now.
It's seriously says kong it's obviously.
The brand but this was the last thing.
This is the last thing he was playing.
With and it was like his this is his.
Final note goodbye and it was just his.
His name.
Khanh i wish you would have given me a.
Little more to work with here ah    i.
Don't think it's fully set in yet that.
He's gone i'm so used to him waking all.
Of us up at 7 a.m. and peeing on my.
Floors and licking my fingers until they.
Dry up crack and bleed a little tongue.
That little stupid little tongue is way.
Too long for its own good i think.
Something needs to be done about the.
Coyote problem in our neighborhood some.
Sort of protection because this is.
Getting ridiculous.
Like i'm not the only one in this.
Neighbor who's lost a dog i just can't.
Believe like what the why me thank you.
To everyone who's reached out to me and.
Wish me condolences it seriously doesn't.
Mean a lot and i know logan you guys.
Loved kong he loved all of you anyways.

Glass for conch tonight for meelo gang.
