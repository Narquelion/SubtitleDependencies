Oh.
Music.
We come a long way from ohio bro it all.
Started with an idea that manifested.
Into merchandise that's now clothing and.
To see it all on a rack.
Although only the first couple.
Iterations this is one of the coolest.
Things in the world.
And not only that this shit's high.
Quality these are one of the items of.
Clothing you wear.
And you only wear this i haven't taken.
This off in days i should probably watch.
It soon it's fashion forward it's.
Comfortable.
It's sexy and if you have a torso this.
Could be for you.
Your torso you can find yourself wearing.
This.
I'm not so good at this i'm proud to say.
That.
It's it was first an idea in my head and.
Now it's come to life and actually i've.
Been on the line all day working hard.
Preparing it for you guys you know from.
Screen printing to drying to folding.
Really making sure these clothes are.
Made with love.
And we are doing a couple of bonuses as.
Well put it some polaroids of me in some.
Of the packaging here not that you'd.
Want it but it is packaged by yours.
Truly get it out of here.
It's my first ever maverick we just got.
It from the factory.
All right so if you guys saw my last.
Vlog you know i've been dying to get the.
Out of los angeles i've been stuck.
In this multi-million dollar mansion for.
Too long i actually think i found the.
Place.
Unfortunately i can't say where it is.
Yet because what happened in yosemite.
This is where it gets tricky because i.
Want to leave today and there's only one.
Person i know that has an rv look i know.
I    up your rolls royce when you.
Gave it to me.
I know when you let me drive your can-am.
I flipped it going four miles an hour.
But i was wondering uh can i borrow that.
I won't you know i don't think listen we.
Got this on camera.
You can take it anything that happens.
From this point forward he's stolen i.
Don't know what happened.
Yes yes when this thing opens up it is.
Paradise turn the generator on.
Wash it and then you're done it'll go.
Back to green.
Clips right on there and you can walk.
Right up and plug them into here push.
Arm out.
Entry step keep it on yo it starts motor.
Needs to be on when these go.
Up or down everything's very similar.
Simple.
It doesn't seem too complicated.
Oh my god this is a big    i know.
What i'm doing no.
That's a lie this thing is    huge.
Real slow watch the god amazon prime.
Thank you for your service.
Are you    kidding me i just.
Decided i actually don't want to drive.
This five hours to do.
All right so i hired a driver his name.
Is chris and he looks like a good guy.
Like real good looking kid but i don't.
Know if that always translates to.
Driving a 36 foot long rv.
And so it's kind of just like a fingers.
Crossed operation does this thing.
Actually fit in one lane it's like one.
And a half how do you drive it on a.
Phone you don't you don't.
Chris does who's to say that he's even.
Driving chris can we confirm that you're.
Driving this vehicle who's driving one.

Destination it's    seven a.m in.
The morning right now i'm sure you can.
See this guy behind me the sun's coming.

Us up in the morning and tell us to.
Off but we're all pretty exhausted until.
Then we'll try to get like two three.
Hours of sleep so wish me luck.
Oh holy hell we've had a crazy.
Day i haven't really found a spot to.
Illegally park this rv yet we're working.
On it but it's fine because there's.
Really only one thing i want to do while.
