All hi sisters.
James charles here,
And welcome back to my youtube channel.
You guys, for today's video i am so beyond excited,
Because this is a collab that i've wanted to do.
For a very very long time.
Today we are joined.
With mr. kate. - oh my god.
We're having sister kate and daddy joey over here, and.
You guys-- -  daddy joey.
Yes, definitely daddy joey. - oh my god.
I'll take it. - okay, good.
We are together today,
Because we are doing a collab.
That is not makeup related for once,
It is house related. -  yes.
Because all you sisters know,
I recently bought a house.
A few months prior, - mm-hmm.
And i moved in.
I've been here for quite a while now,
And by the time this video's going up,
It is, i believe january. - yes.
Maybe. - yes.
That means i've been in the house.
For about four months, now. - mm-hmm.
And that means that you guys still.
Have not gotten a house tour.
He's been busy, okay. - i've been a little bit busy.
Palette, merch, traveling the world .
A little bit, yes.
As soon as i bought this house,
Kate was like we need to do something.
And i was like oh, absolutely.
Because i've been subscribed to kate and joey.
For literally years now. - so sweet.
For the longest time ever.
I stan you guys, i think you guys have one.
Of seriously.
The coolest channels on youtube.
I've been there since like before even, like 300,000.
Like, the longest time. - wow, oh my god.
Swear to god, the longest time.
Like i said, as soon as we moved in,
Kate hit me up and was like we wanna do a makeover,
And i was like please,
I need help. -  yeah.
But, i wanted to do something for my channel, too,
Because like i said,
This collab i've wanted to do.
For a very very long time now. - i know.
And he's so passionate about interior design,
Which is so cool.
Yes.
So, for today's video we are doing something.
That kate and joey have.
Never done before, actually. - never.
And i am so beyond excited, because.
We are obviously going to do the.
Full-room transformation over on kate's channel.
We'll talk about that in a little bit while.
We're going through the house, - yep.
And you guys can see that.
Video over there. - yep, yep.
Go subscribe, please.
But over here, because of the fact.
That so many of the rooms are.
In the process, not done but also not the worst,
We figured it'd be--.
Started. - yes.
Sister started.
Sister--.
We figured obviously we want to let kate shine.
And do her makeover,
But for my channel we want to do a more.
Collaborative type thing. - mm-hmm.
And work together to finish.
A lot of the rooms that i've started.
And kinda show you guys what the process looks like.
Of actually taking a room.
And doing it from start to finish.
So, this might be a little bit of a longer video,
But i'm so excited to just take you guys through it.
There's gonna be a full production, hgtv is shaking.
Mr. kate and james charles are coming for you guys.
So without further ado,
Let's walk through the house,
Show you guys what we have going on,
Show you what we wanna do,
And let's decorate together.
Alright sisters.
So we're here at the front door.
And we thought we'd do a little bit.
Of a walk-through through the house.
To show you guys what is done,
What isn't done and what we really need to work on.
For this little house makeover.
I'm gonna be really honest with you guys,
We already filmed this entire thing a month ago.
And the footage is nowhere to be found.
But would it be a james charles video.
Without a technical difficulty.
No, so we're going to redo it today.
Redo it, we've already rehearsed.
It's going to be way faster.
Joey kate's a month more pregnant.
I'm a yup, bigger belly.
Thank you, disclosure.
I know we've had over a month to think about space.
And order some stuff as well. - yeah.
We though we'd walk you through it, again,
But this time kind of talk about our thought process.
As to why we chose each thing.
And what the room is going to be--.
The plan. - as apposed.
To our initial first reactions.
Yeah. - so this is like a review.
Instead of our first impression.
It'll be better.
So without further ado,
Let's walk through the house.
Let's do it. - again.
Again .
So room number one is my pr package room.
This is like the big,
Like it's really your entrance room in a way.
It is, and this is the most office we've ever had.
We did the list already, spoiler alert.
We've already ordered.
A majority of things for this house makeover.
And they've arrived. - and they've arrived.
Both clearly.
So actually, we'll be able to execute this.
Yeah, but for right now,
We're keeping all the boxes in this room.
Because this particular entrance foyer,
Living room space. - formal living room.
Is not going to be in my video.
Because--.
We're going to be doing it.
For an omg we're coming over episode.
On our channel.
All of the boxes are being stored in here.
For every the other makeover.
So let's move on the the next room.
The dining room.
Is probably most unused room in the entire house.
Really.
Well yeah, i don't really eat--.
Yeah you don't eat-- - here.
Oh right, you don't eat or ever dine.
But people sit here sometimes. - no, but does anybody--.
And work sometimes. - true.
Does anyone really eat in their dining room though.
Depends.
If you have another eating room,
Which you do, - which i do in the kitchen.
Yeah, we're gonna style them.
So that this doesn't become an area.
Where crap gets collected.
Like it is right now.
Drag me. - oh my god .
I want this to feel like a fall family room.
So let's talk about what we need in this room.
First of all-- - lighting.
This light is literally the ugliest thing i've ever seen.
In the entire world.
I want it gone immediately.
Yeah, it's like very spider, spideress.
It's gross. - yeah.
And i feel like they use like sconces.
Also really tacky. - sconces.
Right, which you specifically didn't like.
That kind of plasticy look to the shade.
And it looks like the cups.
If you got to your grandma's house when you we're younger.
And she would serve drinks and those,
You know what i'm talking about.
Like the weird, like right, yes.
They're like the hard plastic cups.
Yes. - yes.
Those exact cups. - yes i know.
A fancier one. - yes.
Those just aren't it.
We talked about anchoring this table with a rug.
Because-- - yes.
You have the dining table.
As very much kind of feels connected to that other room.
Yes.
So in order to make sure.
This really feels like its own space.
Yes. - an area rug is key for that.
I feel that way too,
And as well the table is wood.
And the hardwood floor is also wood,
Which for me, i don't like. - right.
So we're gonna separate it. - then it'll separate it.
Which is really really nice.
And you already have some awesome plants.
You can work with.
Yeah. - we can order.
Some more planters and stuff.
But really this room is pretty straightforward.
Great, so let's just start simple moving on.
Yes.
Sisters scoot.
To the next room. - yeah.
So the next room in the house is our sister office.
Which needs a little bit of work.
I will say we do work kind of all around the house.
But i definitely want a good anchor point.
In the home for everybody to just come,
Just get everything done.
And to just really focus it.
We talked about you wanted to do the neon sign.
Right. - yes.
Just the sisters on the outside here.
So i really want to get a sisters on the outside.
And this was kate's idea.
But i though it would be so,
Just so cute and fun and chic.
Just to light up everything in the mood.
We're doing white of course, duh.
Yeah, that's already ordered.
Yes.
We've already got a lot. - on its way.
We have some art we want to hang--.
We talked about doing floating shelves here.
Just to have additional area.
For storage but also for some display stuff.
Then we also ordered three stools.
Which was your idea - yeah.
And i love it so if you want.
To talk about a little bit.
Sure, well i was just seeing you have.
The two chairs in here.
But because you want to maybe have some meetings.
Or you also we're talking about how you want.
To put your calendar on this tv.
Yeah, so there was a tv in the triple.
When we first moved in.
And i live my life by my calendar--.
Yeah.
So i really want to have it displayed.
On the tv at all times so i can come in here.
Check everything and we can have team meetings.
And schedule videos and basically everything.
I definitely think some subtle changes.
In this room will really take it.
Above and beyond-- - yeah.
And it's for the perfect sisters workspace.
Great, love it.
Yeah, organization, functionality, no rug,
It's less about design,
It's more about just pulling it together.
Yes. - so it is petite but--.
Yes. - a lot has happened in here.
Yes. - okay, done.
Yes.
Alright, so coming out of the office we have one.
Of the main foyers.
Coming into the kitchen and living room,
These are more of the spaces i'm excited about.
Because this is where i spend 80% of my time.
As do most people. - right.
Right, living room and kitchen.
Is where everyone gathers.
Yes, i will say,
Out of all the spaces that i've done,
This one is obviously not even.
Close to being decorated but--.
But you did them both in here.
James yes, but i do like how it looks.
Kate i mean you picked the most amazing,
Comfortable couch,
It's a comfortable couch. - it's gigantic.
Like you're just drawn to it over here.
The hard part is when you have such a big sectional,
You want the rug to.
Match the scale of it.
James yeah, and this rug is not the right size.
Kate we got a way bigger, like jute,
But white jute rug-- - yes.
Which will be so nice and homey.
It's right off of your backyard,
So it has that almost beachy feel to it.
Right, which i love. - it's cool out there.
And then we talked about getting more accessories.
For these built in shelves.
Because-- - yes.
So basically-- - they're amazing.
They are.
And what happened was.
I literally propped up all my decor pieces.
From my old apartment.
And whenever we moved in the first day,
I just unpacked them.
And put them all on the shelves randomly.
To move around later and never moved them around.
And then people come and go.
"oh my god your shelves are so cute.".
I'm like, what.
So this definitely needs to be filled way up.
And what's cool too,
Is we have a lot of shelf space to work with.
So definitely allows us.
To get a lot of really amazing decor pieces.
Yes.
Kate and i are about to go shopping in a little bit.
Actually to get some fine pieces.
So you guys will see that in a few minutes.
So that's pretty much the entire shelf region.
Yeah.
So what i'm really excited about.
That you actually suggested that i was a little bit--.
When you said it, you were like.
Oh i feel like you need a different coffee table.
And i was like-- - excuse me,
I love this coffee table.
I love this coffee table.
But your thought process behind it.
I actually really liked.
So why don't you talk a little bit about that.
Sure, so i was just seeing.
That you have this large scale sofa.
That creates almost a square here.
So seeing a square coffee table seems.
To be the more organic choice. - yeah.
And it'll be just that more accessible.
For people sitting on this arm--.
Because if you're here--.
Right, you can't.
Not going to. - and he has long arms.
I'd say.
I really like this table too and what's cool for.
If we're actually not getting rid of it,
No. - we're using it upstairs.
Which we'll get to in a second.
And then you have that amazing picture that you took.
Yeah so-- - right over there.
So joey if you want to rotate yourself around there.
We have this huge wall which is blank.
And needs to filled pretty badly.
We took a few different pictures.
That i've took on my travels.
And we blew them up in black and white.
We're getting them framed,
So i think they'll be so chic on the walls.
Just to kind of separate everything.
So we're just decorating this room, literally.
Bringing in the coffee table, the rug,
Shelf accessories, art work on the wall,
Just pull it all together.
Just jump off from what you've already started.
Alright, the sisters.
What do we call it. - outside.
Sister outside .
This needs a lot of work.
Working on that. - let's be honest.
Kate yeah.
James i feel like once again,
One of those places that with a few minor changes.
Will really make a big impact.
Kate yeah.
We do already have a tv and a cute fireplace out here,
So i feel like just a little seating moment, maybe.
And then - yeah.
Maybe some shady lounge like lawn chair vibe.
Like right over there. - yes.
Like either in the grass.
With a side table in between.
Really just something for you.
To come out here and actually sit down.
And relax, yeah.
So that's pretty much the outside.
Yeah. - all done.
Next place, breakfast stuff. - yeah.
James kind of tiny.
But i feel like it's important considering.
It's literally what you see when you walk in the front door.
Totally, right.
You see right down into it - right smack dab.
And into the backyard.
Yeah. - yeah.
So you eat here, and there.
Yes.
So you actually use this table a lot.
We do actually.
I just think this space can be a lot more welcoming.
This light is literally, it's 10 best.
It looks like it was a three dollar lamp from walmart.
We have another chair somewhere in the house, i think.
That will be brought back down.
Okay.
To make the set.
And then i think the same thing here,
Just a centerpiece on the table.
Right. - so they go together.
We also talked about doing another piece.
Of artwork there. - yes.
To just mirror image.
And then curtains here too,
Just to bring in a textiles. - yes.
So the majority of the windows you have shades.
And you also have a lot going on.
That curtains don't make sense,
But here they make sense.
You can see how they frame nicely.
I think they're going to,
Yes that's what i was going to say.
They'll make it feel like a lot more comfy-cozy,
Yeah. - which will be good.
Because this space definitely needs it.
Great.
So that what makes breakfast so easy.
Kitchen, next.
I don't think there's a lot.
To be done in here which is great.
Because i feel a kitchen is a place.
Where you don't really decorate that much.
Well i mean, you have beautiful kitchen,
With the finishes and everything,
So you don't have to distract.
But yeah, i think a centerpiece there.
Yes. - something.
Which maybe we can pick out of the collection.
Of the beautiful, tall, lengthy,
So even if it's just white ceramic.
Or something, so pretty. - yeah.
So that's pretty much the kitchen as well,
Yeah. - so it's simple.
Now we just have upstairs, right.
Should we head up.
Yes. - let's go.
More for our glutes.
Up the stairs, we're doing butts.
James ready.
Oh god, i've got to hold my boobs.
This is my first time doing cardio.
It's great.
Oh great, this is a paramount.
Okay, welcome to the upstairs.
I'm very very excited about this.
Because the to of my favorite rooms.
In the entire house are up here;.
My master and the sister studio.
So-- - oh my god.
You good. - sister winded please,
I'm what can we do about it.
Yeah, so this landing is great.
Because it's wide, it's epic,
You got your bedroom here,
You got your beauty room over there.
This all is going to my least favorite wall.
In the entire house.
I think these built ins are so ugly.
And i just don't, like why.
Well we just talked about doing pillows here.
Yes. - on the benches.
And once again somewhat similar to downstairs,
There's just lots of shelf space.
That we should fill up with some cool pieces.
Just so we can be a little bit more put together.
We can't get rid of this.
So we may as well make it look great.
While it's here.
Yeah.
So this wall is completely blank right now.
And that's because what was here.
Is currently being customized.
So you guys know as youtubers,
When we hit certain milestones,
We always get our little plaque.
Which is always super super exciting-.
Really exciting.
And an amazing this to work towards.
So i have my one million plaque standing right here.
But i just got my 10 million plaque.
Which is so crazy. - oh my god such a milestone.
That's crazy. - that's so awesome.
Oh it's been so exciting-- - it's so cool.
And obviously that took a lot of time.
And a lot of hard work.
And i want to display it in a really cool way--.
But, it was a really cool idea that you had.
Because the plaque comes as,
It's just more as a trophy. - right.
Kind of thing, right.
It's like that big play button.
Yeah.
It's not framed like the one million plaque--.
Right, so--.
But this designer right here was like,
"let's frame it." - let's frame it.
So i really like how the one million plaque.
Was displayed like the gold play button.
Inside the big shadowbox.
So i took both the one million and 10 million.
To a custom framer here in california.
And we are getting them both reframed.
Because i even though i like the one million one,
I didn't really like the grey background.
Kind of ugly.
I love how you're customizing your own plaques.
We're going to cut it open-- - sorry youtube.
Let's redesign everything- - it's hilarious.
Cutting it open, taking the one million out.
And were also getting the 10 million.
Huge diamond play button costumed framed.
So they'll be in matching frames.
And there will be the one million.
And the 10 million,
Right here, exactly matching.
Looking beautiful and fun and fashion chic.
I think it will be a really amazing way.
Just to look back at all my achievements right.
Before you come into the sister studio.
Which brings us to the next room in the house.
The sister studio. - sister studio.
Oh my gosh, this room is so important.
So-- - it's crazy.
The sister studio is probably,
Honestly my favorite room of the entire house.
I love equipment and videography and lighting.
And just trying to see how i can really elevate myself.
And make my content that much better.
So for me, this studio has like.
A dream project of mine forever.
Just to really have the best production space.
Humanly possible to make my content the best.
For all of my sisters watching.
Totally.
As you can see, there's a full on metal cage.
That we built in this room-- - which is rad, yeah.
James which is so cool.
And basically that's where basically all the equipment.
Hangs from which is amazing because it takes everything.
Off of the floor,
Which makes the decorating way better.
It makes it feel a lot bigger.
Because this room was very very crammed at first.
Yeah, i mean you host people like kim kardashian.
In this room-- - yeah.
So you want to have it be.
A little bit more like a studio feel.
Right.
So like this table and the table below--.
Has to go.
Kate we talked a lot about this table.
This table has been at the source.
Of so much stress about this--.
Kate our most emails back and forth have been.
About this table. - literally, let me finish.
So for me, this table is literally from ikea.
I got this when i first moved here.
And it was great at first-- - yeah.
But my videos are just getting bigger.
And bigger production wise.
And if had any other videos,
This entire table would be like,
If i pick anything up everything else would fall off.
Absolutely. - like it's bad.
Yeah.
So a bigger table to work on.
And to not feel so cluttered.
Is going to be great for your brain.
Biggest thing. - yeah.
So we found that table with--.
We found the table, god bless.
Thank god. - yes.
We really wanted a seating area on this end.
Because like i said, we do film a lot of bigger collabs.
And if i'm bringing a celebrity client,
Sometimes they bring their team or their manager over.
Or even if its like bigger collabs,
And only one person on the screen,
Friends will be chilling here.
Right.
And all time time i'm filming alone.
And my manager and my assistant and my writer.
Will all be here watching.
I just want a comfortable space.
For everybody to just once again.
Have it feel like an actual studio.
Okay so we were going to do a little couch,
Like a little, almost like a bench.
With a back on it. - yeah, for the sitting area.
And then, you texted me around christmastime.
Yes.
We met over christmas.
And you were like this is the plan.
And you were like,
"okay ethan got me a custom bench.".
James which is literally so cool.
So cool. - and so sweet.
If you guys saw my collab with the dolan twins and emma,
This is just fun for our christmas video.
Ethan got me a customed sisters bench.
Which i think is so incredibly cute.
And he literally got it for me.
Because of the fact that we've filmed.
So many collabs together.
Where our butts are literally broken by then end of it.
And we cannot feel it either. - and you all have.
Very small butts.
I mean, well i mean thick,
Thick, thick butts, but not.
Well anyways.
You all have lovely thick butts.
And we need a think bench for support.
Yeah to sit on.
So we don't literally break our backs.
By the time we're done filming.
But since we thought.
Since it's usually just me filming,
We could really easily use ethan's sisters bench.
And put it against this wall.
And decorate it with pillows.
So that everyone is really comfortable.
And then that way too,
We can also see the custom sisters.
On the front-- - exactly, beautiful, lit up.
Because it actually lit up, right.
Yeah it's actually full led. - yeah you can plug it in.
It's so cool. - yeah.
And of course if we have a bigger collab,
Then we can move the bench quickly.
Over to there-- - swap them out.
So we can sit more comfortably.
Yep i love that.
So this is the wall when you walk in the door.
To the sisters studio, you see this wall.
This is what they see.
Kate had this really cool idea.
Well we were just talking about doing a custom sign.
You wanted to use sister studio.
So you did kind of like a splatter paint thing.
Yes - with sisters studios.
And then we're having it custom made.
On acrylic with then a stand-off.
Of the sisters studio.
So it's going to be black and white.
Of course-- - of course, duh.
Keeping with the aesthetic,
But then you'll walk in.
And see this big, giant sister studio.
Should we got to-- - the master's.
The last and final where all the magic happens.
Hmmm not a lot magic happends there let's be real.
We're working on that. - we're working on that.
Once we figure out that room there's going.
To be lots of magic.
The master.
Yes.
The master bedroom.
Oh my god, i've never seen someone.
Back that ass up into the bedroom first.
So the last bedroom i'm very very excited for.
Because this is the space i'm in.
This is your sisters suite.
Yes.
So luckily this is really just an amazing suite.
For me to kind of unwind at the end of the day.
So we already have a few major pieces.
And here is what we got started.
Spoiler alert, if you'll notice i have no bed right now.
Yes because joey took it.
Yes joey stole my bed.
So as soon as we walked in here, joey noticed.
So your bed was a little bit small, right.
Just four-post bed.
Four-poster.
Four-post.
James and kate four-poster.
Four-poster bed.
And because your ceiling goes at an incline,
It just-- - it does.
Joey it looked a little short.
So we're going to keep it platform.
But i'm basically just going to rebuild all the posts.
And make it that much taller.
So it looks that much more grand.
But keep it in the platform style.
Which is the style that you like.
James right, for sure.
Kind of like that lower, more minimal vibe.
Okay so what we talked about in here obviously.
Just really completing the space.
Yeah.
Because you have your bed.
That's being augmented,
But this side of the room is pretty much good.
Yes.
But this side of the room is totally empty.
It's like the ottoman.
Right. - needs has space here.
This wants to be a living room.
Like in order to make it a suite,
You have a living space attached.
To your sleeping space. - right.
It's going to be so elegant. - right.
And cozy.
So kate had the really really good idea.
Of putting a full-on, third living room.
In the house with a sofa and two chairs.
Which i think is going to be so cute.
So cute.
We picked out literally the best stuff ever.
And cvq is literally right downstairs.
Right now delivering everything.
#nosponsored but please.
But it should be. - it should be.
I think that will have the master bedroom feel a lot more,
Like you said, like actual suite,
For i can like relax and chill in.
In summary, we're building you a bigger bed,
We are having this be a modular piece.
Either here or there,
We're creating a living space anchored with the rug,
We're bringing the coffee table from downstairs up here,
And we're style the shelves.
And just making it a sister suite.
Is all the from the shelf store.
I think so.
Are we done.
Are we done.
Joey it's time to shop.
James.
Alright you guys.
So we just arrived at homegoods.
And we're going to be basically do decor shopping.
All day today. - all the accessories.
Thankfully we ordered all the large items online.
Which is great because we don't have.
To cram them in your tesla.
Right.
They're being delivered.
They're being delivered, thank god.
So we are here for all those accessories,
The shelf items, the table top items,
Trays, centerpieces, faux plants galore.
Like, we're just going to fill it up.
Because you can always return.
So i always say,
Buy more than you need. - more is better.
Yeah, see what we can get here.
And if we need to, go to another store.
But like-- - we have lots of options.
We have all day. - yeah.
Joey perfect, totally your aesthetic.
Joey you're fired.
This one for your master.
Because you have the smaller ones right.
True, yeah.
I feel like this actually is not bad.
Cute, i love it.
Like a little topiary.
Just super simple and minimal.
I mean, i love crystals.
What is that smear.
Okay, so we were talking about doing.
Like a gathering of taller vases,
Like maybe on your kitchen island--.
Yeah, or somewhere.
You have centerpiece situation potential.
For the dining table.
Do you like this.
I love that.
I love like also mixing it with,
There's this other textured one up there.
Ew, it looks like octopus tentacles.
Got it.
No octopus, okay.
What about this one.
Oh i like that. - right.
Pretty, that will be pretty.
It has a little bit more of the natural tone.
Coming through, look.
Sisters not twins. - that'll look good together.
Right, i love that.
Too thick.
I do love a thick sister.
We do like thick sisters.
That'll be good actually. - here, okay.
Oh i was saying this is like your aesthetic.
On the globe.
Yeah. - right.
Do you like the smaller one better.
Because i love the accent of the gold.
Okay well actually the smaller one is probably good.
Because-- - it'll fit on the shelf.
Oh, love that.
Perfect, geometric-- - and oh--.
I think that's their display.
We can take it, what are they going to do about it.
Yeah, let's be like, put a price on it.
We'll take it.
An hourglass.
Ew, that sand is disgusting.
Okay, rude.
What about this.
This is a chic.
Is it too gold.
A what.
It's too gold for you.
Oh, i thought you said a pa-too-gold.
I could just make up words.
This is a pa-too-gold.
Yeah, i actually don't mind it.
Right.
I don't mind it either.
I just love, love, love the shape of it.
Very much-- - what would you put in there.
It could be anywhere,
Depends on where you put it;.
Entryway, keys, whatever, on the coffee table, remotes.
Let's do it. - let's do it.
I'll trust you on the gold.
Great.
Oh my god, is this a freakin' silver slinky.
That's what i had in my hand.
And do you really like it.
It's kind of cool.
I love it.
Kind of fun right.
It's a silver slinky, yes.
Wait, this was before your time though.
You were born after this was popular.
I know what a slinky is.
You watch your attitude.
I'm not that young.
Do you like crystals because you know i love crystals.
Do you like them white. - i do.
I think they're pretty. - i love a white crystal.
Yes.
Did you grab one of theses.
Ew. - too hammered.
Hammered, i love that.
Oh wait, there's a sleeker one underneath it.
Do you like that.
For like down like the dining room table potentially.
Or even under the vases.
On your long weird shelves.
Under your tv in the family room.
Not weird, glorious.
They are a little strange.
Right. - that could be good.
You know, 'cause then,
'cause even just having something reflective.
Under something else, is nice.
It just kind of amplifies. - okay.
Joey and to finish it all off.
Kate oh, burlap elephant.
Joey totally your aesthetic.
What is this.
I picked that up.
I don't think it will really fit anywhere.
But it is kind of chic.
I like it.
It could be on the coffee table by itself.
Or on, do you have a mantle in your bedroom.
Or no.
You don't have an actual mantle.
No.
But you do have a counter ledge.
Oh on the side.
Yes we do.
Yeah - yeah. okay.
We can do this.
James look at this.
Oh, i love that.
Yeah, a nice, like aged patina to go with that.
'cause that is-- -  patina.
But, what. patina.
I'll put too gold.
No but i-- - patina's a real word.
Patina's a real word.
I'll put too gold and patina.
I like that a lot.
You like that, okay.
Let's grab that. - okay.
Ew. - yeah, that's a little gross.
This is kind of chic though. - yeah, love that.
That's very, at the farm house vibe in your house.
I really like this a lot.
Yeah, i love that.
We can put a beefy candle in here.
Joey i found the perfect one.
Oh no, joey. - joey why.
Oh my god. - so-.
Joey t, t.
I'm so scared for these little kids.
What about a simple frame with a matte.
Because this on its side i think would fit.
Within one of the shelves.
Joey wait, where's our other cart.
Oh, right.
James.
Oh it's right here, i got it.
This says create, its kind of cute.
That is cute.
I love how simple that is.
Look at this. - create.
This is such a chic little pencil holder.
It's at an angle. - yes.
That's so your vibe. - let's grab this too.
Look at these together.
Oh my gosh. - so good.
Coming together.
Oh my gosh, i love this.
This is so fun.
Just left the doctor,
Let me know what you think.
Like what about up on the desk.
I don't know if it would fit anywhere.
Let's get it.
Great.
Kate alright, here's what we got so far.
You can see jame's aesthetic.
Is apparent.
In the shopping cart.
Face tuning in the aisle.
I just posted on instagram, kate.
Kate well i know, we're in a long line.
Do it.
Alright, the load in.
Let's see how much this tesla can handle.
Probably a lot.
Kate probably a lot.
It's an suv.
How many pieces did we end up picking up.
45 i think she said.
Kate yep, 45 items.
So we're definitely on a good path to decor.
Kate yeah i think that,
Let's stop by target really quick.
And grab just some other like throw blankets.
And other doodads and we're good.
We're going to target.
We're going to target. - oh we're going to target.
Alright, so we just loaded the car,
We loaded our bellies plus one.
I was just about to say that.
Oh my god. - love that frost.
I do love that frost.
And we have drew joining us too at target.
He's in a separate car.
But we're heading over to target to get more bits and bobs.
Yup.
And items that have jacks.
Yup throw blankets and trays.
See you there. - decor.
So we want some more options to find that much.
Yes.
We want throw blankets.
And let's just get some more. - everything.
Bits and bobs.
Bits and bobs.
Oh yeah, so cute. - it's a good pillow.
Kate good pillow.
Joey and i should be able to pick on thing.
From every store for you.
I think this is totally you aesthetic.
Joey i--.
That's disgusting.
Kate one minute in.
That child needs to stop screaming immediately.
Kate what about this simple bookend.
No. - no, okay.
This is much better than the other one.
No but it's not-- - that one looks cheap.
Different.
I like that one.
But you can have two.
Remember how many shelves we have.
True.
Drew i think we probably need this.
James what.
I don't know, to put options in.
Oh yes. - that's kind of cute.
Yeah. - no, i like that.
A simple tray.
See you questioned it and then you liked it.
Yeah, good, good, good.
Yeah. - great.
I like both of these - yeah, yeah.
Love that.
Oh it's heavier than i thought.
Kate love the matte.
Because we got some shiny finished ones at homegoods.
I like these a lot.
So those are beautiful mixed in.
Oh look how chic these planters are.
Love.
That's the best planter i ever did see.
Oh, perfect.
We'll be needing this. - yeah.
Oh look at those baskets.
Those cork baskets are so good.
Ooh.
Wow, that's the best purchase ever.
Wow, the cart got closer than i was expecting.
Should we buy it. - yeah.
Oh wait.
Oh my god you said that about the fake plant.
And the baby just kicked me in my belly,
So he approves of the fake plant.
I like this a lot.
Leaning in the family room.
Or when you're having a sister santa moment.
When you just want to mount here mantle.
I love mounting my mantle.
Okay, great. - i think that's good.
I love it.
Here are things james will never use.
James this is so true.
Do you want a rolling pin. - definitely.
I really love those, the felt.
That's such a good item.
Kate that's cute.
That's even cuter.
Okay, so we're about to check out right now from target.
But i first want to pause.
Because look at how good, go, pull back.
Look at how good these carts look together.
These carts look so chic. - so good.
This is my favorite thing.
When you start seeing the room come together.
James yes.
Kate like in the shopping cart.
James look how at how good everything looks.
Like are you even kidding.
Yes.
We have all the textures, we have the soft,
We've got the plants,
We've got the wood elements.
This literally looks the best in the entire world.
Like are you kidding me. - i know, it's amazing.
Well kate, we're really talented.
Full car-- - getting there.
Kate but there's still room for us.
That was a lot.
I'm mr. kent.
I'm here.
I'll take a look at your place.
We'll stop by for a while.
And help you find your style.
We'll laugh at full payments delegate.
Kate i love you.
James hey i told you i'm ready.
For you to go on maternity leave.
So focused.
I know you're already remixing me.
I'm scared.
You're coming for me.
James i really am.
You guys, the new table is literally already here.
It's so beautiful.
James it's so big and beautiful.
Kate it's also going to be so easy.
To also clean thankfully.
James wow this is the most she got.
For this entire room i think.
Kate yup.
Wow good morning world and to my luxury bedroom.
Wow i don't know where i would go.
Maybe i'll sit on my nice luxury couch.
And watch my luxury television.
And put my luxury feet on my luxury table.
Kate okay, so i don't mind the mirror there.
But it would also look amazing right there.
Pretty.
James that's a good background.
Yeah. - yeah.
So good.
Joey that's a good fake plant.
Really good fake plant.
A fake agave.
So cute.
And then a taller one over there.
Yeah definitely.
Something for the--.
Kate the bird of paradise maybe, right.
Should we get that too. - yes.
I like this birdseye.
Drew oh look at all those balls.
Kate decorative balls.
My favorite.
James look how cute, balls.
Kate i know, look at all those decorative balls.
Our decorative balls.
James we need a good pot for this.
Kate we need a good pot,
You also need to flare those out a little bit,
But you don't want them too flared.
That they slap you in the face.
On your way to go pee-pee.
Ow.
Can you watch where you're flaring that.
We should put the concrete balls in here.
Kate you want to decorative ball room.
Yes.
I don't even know decorative,
I just love decorative balls.
I love big round balls.
Kate yeah, put balls in your room.
And it will summon more balls.
Oh, kate. - yes, auspicious.
Let's--.
Joey here's your smaller ball.
Thank you so much.
Kate yeah, let's see what the decorative ball.
Look like next to it.
The decorative balls.
James okay, i don't think this should,
This doesn't look good here, the big pot.
It's too tall. - it's too tall.
Okay ready for this design magic.
That's about to happen right in your eye.
Kate can you grab, sorry a million another thing,
There should be some target, maybe.
Joey that was good james.
Is that better. - yeah.
Kate yes.
Okay and that goes here and then we put--.
Kate a decorative ball.
James this bowl right here.
What if you do the bigger grey one too.
I like that better because it look more random.
And sometimes you just have to throw stuff.
Hello sisters. - hey guys.
We are back at jame's house today.
Jame's is out at a bunch of meetings today.
But we are here to pull more stuff together.
We just got this new rug down in the living room.
It's glorious - it's beautiful.
So we have so much to do.
We've got signs being delivered today.
We've got so many things to hang on the walls.
Let's do it. - here we go.
So we got this awesome rug in.
This is a great rug.
The rug that was in here before was too small.
For the scale of the sofa.
So now we've got a rug.
That actually the matches the size of the sofa.
And the size of the room.
Just makes it that much more established.
And it's also a natural fiber.
And then we're gonna get the coffee table,
The glass and the concrete coffee table in here.
Which is going to be so pretty.
Joey wait, since james isn't here.
Do you think he'll mind if we rug cuddle.
On his rug.
Ah.
The rug is great,
Is blessed.
With our love.
Alright we have this entryway mirror.
Now up right by the front door.
Look how beautiful, because hello.
James definitely needs a mirror.
To check his.
Snatched self before he leaves.
Update in the office.
The shelves have gone up now over the desk.
Which is going to just make it functional.
And beautiful over here.
We can display things like, oh i don't know,
James' people's choice award.
Should that be the first thing that goes on the shelf.
It fits.
I'm just bringing in some accessories,
Of course i'm going to final style with james.
When he gets back,
But i'm just kind of bringing.
In some items that we would style.
On these office shelves.
Because they're a little bit more utilitarian.
And then this amazing lamp, which we couldn't resist.
The neon sign is going to go here.
He's going to have a whole new editing setup here,
But the office is coming together.
Oh let's bring in the stools too.
Oh--.
Kate oh my god.
James holy crap.
Kate and james that looks so good.
Kate oh my gosh it's in there.
They mounted that beautifully.
What with like glue or something.
Joey yeah i don't even know.
I love when we mount youtube's plaques.
Better than youtube does.
Kate yeah youtube, take some cues.
My picture looks so good there.
Look-- - let's just pause .
Look at what you people-- - look how good this looks.
You people are standing here, holding it.
Joey no it does, it looks so good.
Kind of fun.
Backstory, we took a picture that i took.
On my africa trip were my favorite weeks.
Of my entire life.
And kate wanted to frame it for the middle.
Which i love the idea.
Well yeah i mean-- - it's great.
Kate i love the idea.
Of the black and white photography.
Breaking up the text art.
Joey yeah, that's chic.
That looks the best. - that looks good and fresh.
Yeah, i think it makes the most sense.
Yeah, i like that.
And look, we're ending it right there--.
Right at the end there. - at the end of the beam.
Uh-huh. - perfect.
Shall we right now standing in the sister studio.
Where i film all my videos all day long,
Every single day.
And like what we were talking about,
We needed to add a few extra fun things.
To make it feel like a full production space.
Legit. - so got to have some sign.
Yes, it's going to be-- - wanna see it.
Yeah i wanna see it.
A custom sign that james' designed.
I did. - yes.
I haven't seen it though. - i know.
This is a real friend.
Oh my god, that looks so good.
It looks so good. - oh my god.
Oh my god, i'm obsessed with these splatters.
That literally, turn around.
Oh my god.
Wow.
Will you go stand by it james.
Go stand by it.
Oh my god.
Joey there's going to be a lot.
Of studio selfies in the,
Like whenever you have guests come over,
You have them take a selfie in front of that.
Kate oh yeah.
James on the acrylic and the trace too.
Wow, that's so dope.
Joey good job team.
Kate yay team.
Hello sisters.
It is late afternoon because this morning,
Kate and joey did their reveal.
To me for their room and spoiler alert,
It looks absolutely amazing.
You guys have to check it out on their channel.
But-- - hopefully you like it.
It's literally the best.
But now their crew is on the way out.
And we have the house to ourselves again.
First time in a while, - yeah.
And obviously we have the entire rest.
Of the house to decorate.
So-- - but the fun stuff.
But also fun stuff so,
We have all this decor bits and bobs.
In front of us that we picked out at target.
And saved to all the places.
That you guys saw us sisters shopping at.
So we figured we would show you guys how we want to style--.
The shelves. - the entire house.
At the start of this,
We had 873 items.
In our car approximately. - yeah.
And now looking at the table,
We have like 12.
So slightly concerned.
Joey we also brought some things.
Up to the landing already.
Yeah, we brought some stuff up there already.
We have the boxes to fill in space.
We we're going to get some coffee table books.
But that sort of halfway happened.
We got it for the coffee table.
But we don't really have any shelf books.
Yeah.
Joey which room are we trying to decorate right now.
Let's start this one. - yeah.
Let's just knock it out.
Love it. - let's go bottom out.
Okay, i'm ready.
Do you want that in here.
As a layered moment or over the beanbag.
What if you put sheepskin over the sack bag.
Or whatever you call it.
James do you feel it with clash with the carpet.
Oh let's talk about the carpet.
Let's.
Sister standoff.
I am not loving this carpet right now.
That we have underneath our feet.
And the new one-- - the new one.
The jute carpet.
Joey what is there not to love about it.
James its, i think it's too yellow.
Okay, here's my thing, okay.
Joey it's natural, it's natural white.
It's natural fiber.
You wanted the layered colors,
The layered tones. - yes.
Right, going with minimalist design.
You have to layer different tones.
To create complexity.
Because you don't have wham-bam contrast going on.
This is true.
It's also been the rainiest week ever.
In l.a. history. - it's true.
Don't quote me on that but it's been really dim outside.
So you had the yellowy lights on it all the time.
You literally haven't seen it in.
Full on daylight.
Joey yea or nay carpet.
Nay.
Yea or nay. - yea.
Yea or nay. - yea.
Yea or nay. - yea.
Yea.
I feel attacked.
People do this.
They buy big items.
Before they finish the rest of their place.
They become fixated on that item.
They change it out-- - smart.
They return it and then they just become hung up.
And three years later they haven't decorated their room.
Because they haven't found the right rug.
Whereas, let's live with this.
Let's get the rest of the room put together.
Let the sun shine.
And then call me.
I'm going to give the benefit of the doubt.
Because i trust you. - i know, i know.
And your opinion is very good, not wanting it right now.
I totally feel you.
It's a good life lesson.
Likely this isn't part of the initial shown.
In the video because in the designer process,
Not everything always works perfectly.
No.
Like there always needs to go wrong.
Sometimes you pick things.
And then they look good online,
They don't come the same way.
Me, before i put facetune on instagram.
It's just like, sometimes you need to switch it up.
Or wait until the end and see what it looks like.
I feel like that should be in here,
Once we move the folding table.
This is the room.
Where you most readily wire throw blankets.
Available, right. - yes definitely.
And we got so many great options.
We've got this kind of one-- - that's a good one.
This is good for look, don't cuddle.
Yeah nobody's ever going to cuddle with that.
This one will be the one.
That's permanently on this ladder.
Okay.
The rest of the will be rotating.
I feel like we should put this marble chain.
Underneath the tv.
Yeah, i'm trying to clean.
What we need is,
We need a box for it to drape on.
So you can see the movement of it.
Exactly, great. - beautiful.
Two of our four books are already stylish.
Drew do you think it's too much marble options.
James yeah, we need some other color pops.
To offset it.
So maybe layer it with this guy.
Drew how's this.
I mean that's cute there but now--.
This.
James drew, did you just take this.
Out of my centerpiece.
Drew yeah i did but it's still full.
James drew.
Kate okay james, here's options.
Plant. - yes.
Or sculpture.
Oh that's kind of good. - right.
Because we'll have a lot of plants going on.
In the shelves.
I just want to say this doesn't even look good.
Joey we're not even on that room right now.
Joey.
Joey come back.
Hmm that mirror look not good there.
Kate no.
Yeah it does.
No.
Yeah looks nice, maybe something at the end.
To literally encompass it all.
Kate what about this little dripper.
James oh yeah, i love a little dripper.
Like if we have a little dripper coming.
Plain with the.
Let this not be so straight. - perfect.
Perfect.
Drew no you have to put it on this shelf james.
To make it look like you water it,
Because you can't water it up there.
Joey no one will believe it's real.
That's a good tip.
That is good to know.
I would never think that deep about it.
You should probably quit your job then.
Yeah.
James what do you think about a frame,
Resting frame moment.
James i love the resting frame moment.
Okay.
Do you want him still over there.
Because obviously he has been living over there.
Do you want to change him up. - let's switch him up.
I think we need something actually tall here, though.
To balance out because it likes tall, short, short, tall.
Joey well, what was wrong with that.
Hmm. - too tall.
Kind of ugly.
It looks-- - not ugly, but i feel like-.
Joey doesn't fit.
Drew oh you probably meant a decorative ball.
Decorative ball. - did you try the ball.
James i was thinking about it.
Try it.
Drew that looks nice.
James it's actually kind of good.
Drew very curvy.
I think its good.
And i also kind of love the bookend.
The subtle bookend of the silver sculpture.
It's like this is-- - i like this too.
A magnified version of that.
Okay, i'm taking the price tags off.
Because we loved it.
It ain't about the money, money, money.
Unless it's coffee, coffee, coffee, table books.
Oh wow kate, you are getting brave tonight.
Drew look how chic that it.
Two boxes for the price of one.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're going to use all four.
Of the remaining books. - all four.
Drew it actually looks good.
It looks good but we don't have any more.
For any of the other shelves now.
Drew oh well, this is a main room.
Kate i think we need a candle on it,
We need a candle on it. - oh, please.
That looks so good.
Drew that's a nice aged, mercury glass bitten bottle.
Isn't that so good.
I found it at target on sale,
"i think we're purchasing this right now.".
Kate since we don't have the big, beefy glass tray,
Maybe we use the mirror tray here.
Or do you like it-- - i don't like--.
Clothing.
Well i feel like those two vases are the same height,
So that needs to change.
This is so hard.
Joey i think you should take away the lantern.
And the white vase.
Just leave the cool vase and the plants.
No. - no.
Drew that's illegal.
Just take the watering can away.
Joey no the watering can is the best piece.
James no, the watering can should be on the shelf.
Joey okay, fine.
We need a pot to put this in.
Joey why.
It's in a pot.
It kind of looks chic in that pot.
Yeah. - yeah i like that chic pot.
Joey perfect.
Some little stubs.
I think that can go up, up.
James yeah, up up up and away.
Joey can you do it. - mmhm.
Drew that's a nice bold spot.
Yeah, that is good.
Wait give me the small, joey, give me the small one.
Kate no yeah, that pot is thick.
It's got a thick booty on it.
James that's good.
Kate yeah, we like that there.
What about all the way at the top, this vase.
With the light shining on it for glass floridity.
So will we find a rainbow when the light hits it.
Yeah. - let's try that.
We're going to need a step stool.
To put that up there.
Drew i'll just throw it.
All ooh.
Inspired moment.
James that's luxurious and ratch.
Yes.
We have lots to do still.
He sounds really-- - but guess what.
We get to do it all over again.
Here's your accessory table.
James oh my god.
It looks like it filled back up.
Kate it does look like you have a lot now.
Wow, you should leave that bowl there.
That looks so good.
Joey why did we set this up down here.
When we got to go upstairs.
Joey, always looking-- - that's what i was wondering.
Joey do you think i always look at the negative.
Is this stupid.
Should we repo all this stuff upstairs.
Yeah. - yeah.
All right, here we go.
We get to do it again.
Every place we put the accessories it looks good.
Drew look at this door.
Okay, get excited.
James.
Can i do the desk area.
And you guys can do the other ones.
Sure. - okay.
Joey so just this is all we got to do.
And we're done.
Yay.
That's baby.
Do you want the globe for the top of the piano.
No. - or do you want it here.
Joey i don't think you want it on the piano.
Drew i don't think sisters candles.
Yeah candles. - yeah.
Drew no idea.
Wow this tom ford book is so very chic.
It's the chicest of the chic.
Over there. - yes.
Kate and james bam.
Joey i don't think you need anything else on the piano.
No i agree.
Maybe put it by the little side table.
Just a floor sitter.
Drew a floor sitter option.
I think we should put the table over here.
And instead put the large sculpture maybe here.
Or switch it.
Kate i don't think joey's loves it.
Joey when you walk up the stairs.
And see the wire sculpture, it's amazing.
But that mirror's for our own tv.
Joey oh that's true.
So you want it in the pics.
Yeah, well it's going to be better.
Than that table for your pictures.
So true.
Kate does that fit up here.
Joey so are we good.
I think we're good.
And moral of the story is we got enough stuff.
Yeah we did.
Could have done with the coffee table book or two but.
Joey alright guys.
Did we do it. - are we done.
Think we're done. - i think we're done.
I can't believe it.
Sisters. - sisters.
Is it sleeping time.
Oh my god, we're such sleepy sisters.
I'm supportive.
It's been four days.
And we've had literally the time of our life.
And we just finished literally.
The most beautiful house in the entire world.
I agree.
Yes.
Ah, daddy joey.
Should we head to the beauty studio.
To say goodbye.
Yes, i'll go in the room and say goodbye.
That's so true.
But i'm so glad that it's done.
Okay, so let's do it.
Let's go. - alright.
Oh my god you guys.
We are done. - done.
I really am going to miss you.
I've gotten so, i mean i was already obsessed with you.
But now i'm attached to you.
Same sister.
I feel like literally this collab.
Has been in the works for so long now.
And i've been subscribed to you guys for so long.
And this just meant so much with you.
That you wanted to come over and work together.
On this project too,
Which was so cool.
I know that it was something very different for you guys.
But i feel like it turned out so good.
And i'm just very proud of what we did.
And thank you guys for being the best ever.
And for being talented and for helping me out.
We're so impressed by you. - yeah.
Like you've done so much in such a short amount of time.
Aw, thank you guys.
We talk about you all the time.
I just love watching your growth.
And i'm just so proud of you.
And really, truly so happy for you.
And so excited to always see what you're doing.

Also, like we talked about,
The front living room was very much covered.

Kate and joey we did it.
We took it from empty to full.
We surprised you with a design.
It was the only part of it obviously.
That james didn't have his digits in.
And you we were like fully surprised by it.
So yeah, if you want to see james be sister surprised.

Kate and joey literally have some of the best content.
On the entire youtube platform, in my opinion.
I've been subscribed to them for over four years now.
