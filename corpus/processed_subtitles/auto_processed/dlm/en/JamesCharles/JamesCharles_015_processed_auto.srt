Hi sisters.
James charles here and welcome back to my youtube channel.
As many of you guys know, yesterday was february 14th,
Meaning we celebrated valentine's day,
Which is probably my least favorite holiday of all time.
I've been single for about 19 years now and at this point,
I'm really having trouble figuring out why.
I like to think i'm pretty good looking,
I'm funny every once in awhile,
Have a beautiful house, steady income, lovely family,
Lots of instagram followers, that's a fun plus too.
I can really only think of one issue.
That may get in the way and that's that.
I'm a boy and all the boys that i'm.
Interested in are straight,
But that can't be it, right.
After a lot of thought,
I finally decided okay james, you need help.
It's been long enough.
I decided to reach out to cupid.
And as you can see from the three arrows.
Lodged into my head right now,
He was really out there trying for me yesterday,
But unfortunately i think the arrows.
May have missed the boys because.
I woke up today and i'm still single.
Not gonna lie, at first i was really, really sad about it.
I've wanted a boyfriend for so long now.
I've been trying really hard and it hasn't been working out.
I imagine the cute dates and taking them out to dinner.
And driving around and taking cute instagram photos with.
But then my mood started to change and.
I really had to take a step back and think.
Why am i gonna spend the entire day being sad.
When i could be happy instead.
I know my prince charming will come.
One day if i'm patient, maybe.
Even if another boy doesn't love me back right now,
At least i know that i love me and that's all that matters.
I decided to spend my day on myself.
Doing what i love the absolute most, playing with makeup,
And this is the look that i came up with.
Without further ado,
If you wanna see how i created this.
Anti valentine's day makeup look, keep on watching.
Alright you guys, let's just jump right into.
This pretty in depth tutorial.
We're gonna be focusing mostly on the eyes,
What's going on underneath the glitter,
And also the arrows that we're going to.
Sister stab into my head for a real one.
As you can see, i'm starting off with my base already done.
I just went ahead off camera and used.
My normal products like always, but for my brows,
I did use something a little bit different.
That i get to tell you guys about today.
And that is, drum roll please,
The brand new anastasia dip brow gel.
I am very, very honored that anastasia asked me.
To be the first beauty guru to reveal this to you guys.
It is basically exactly what you would think,
A hybrid between dip brow and brow gel.
It is an insanely pigmented, super full coverage,
Waterproof, and smudge-proof brow gel.
It comes just like this and this has.
Literally been my newest staple addition to my brow routine.
I'm obsessed with this.
I'm not gonna go too much more in depth.
Because anastasia's gonna be talking about it.
A lot in the next few weeks.
If you guys wanna see how i fully use it,
Make sure to check out my video next friday,
But i just wanted to give you guys.
A little sneak peek of it now.
Here it is and get ready for this.
To literally take over the brow world.
Now that being said, my face is done,
My brows are locked in place,
And let's move right along to the eyeshadow.
Portion of this look.
I'm just gonna go ahead and zoom you guys right in.
To my face so you guys can get all the.
Details for the eye portions.
I don't really do tutorials very often, but whenever i do,
You guys always ask me to zoom in.
So you can actually see what's going on.
Hopefully this is good.
Welcome to my face.
It's very crusted and pimply right now,
But we're gonna make it work.
Starting off this look today,
I'm just gonna grab my mac paint pot in the shade painterly.
And apply a generous coat of this to my eyelid.
I'm just gonna blend this all over the lid,
Acting as our eye base slash primer.
I'm not going to set this in with any powder.
Grabbing the james charles x morphe palette.
And an m456 brush, use code james for 10% off your purchase,
I'm gonna dip right into the shade boutique with this brush.
And use this color to start stamping.
That cut crease shape into my lid.
Just going to focus and push this color.
Right above my natural crease because.
We are going to cut it a little bit later on,
But i just wanted to lay down the darkest shade first.
And then we're going to blend upwards.
Once we get to this outer corner,
I'm just going to feather it out and pull it up.
In the shape of a wing.
I'm next gonna grab a little bit of a bigger fluffy brush,
The is the m433, and dip into the shade love that.
In the palette and use that to buff out boutique.
I'm basically just stamping this color on there.
And then using very, very tiny and light circular motions,
Just lightly diffusing it upwards.
Make sure that there are no harsh lines or edges.
Grabbing a different m433,
I'm gonna dip into the shade skip in the bottom corner.
This is the bright neon pink.
I'm gonna use that color to buff out love that.
I'm not liking how this is looking.
Maybe if i grab a little bit of you're kidding.
And put this overtop.
This eyeshadow look so far is turning out.
Like every single relationship i've ever had,
A major failure.
That's looking a wee bit better.
Now that we have the crease all laid out.
And kind of blended,
I'm gonna grab a little bit of the.
Tarte shape tape concealer and just.
Put in on the back of my hand.
Using a flat top brush, i'm just going to cut the crease.
Just going to stamp this brush.
Right above my natural crease.
Then we're just going to carve out the line.
Wow, that is a cute crease if i ever did see one.
Thank god something went right.
I'd like to thank not only god.
But also jesus.
And cupid.
Just kidding, he's a little bitch.
Once the lid is all cut and the.
Concealer has dried down a little bit,
I'm gonna grab an m124 brush and.
Dip into the shade pinkity drinkity in my palette.
And i'm going to use this color to set in the lid.
Then to cut that crease even further.
And just add a little pop of something,
I'm gonna grab the urban decay heavy metal glitter liner.
This one is in the shade grind.
It's a light pink almost holographic glitter in here.
And we're just going to use this and.
Line right in this crease area, following that cut.
You're gonna wanna take a deep breath.
And go very slow while you do this.
Be patient because if you mess us this line,
It's gonna look so crusted and dusted and wonky.
You also will definitely have to do.
Multiple layers on this liner because.
If you want it to look good, you have to do a lot of layers.
If you do make any mistakes with the liner,
Just fan your eyeball until everything dries.
And then very, very carefully you can.
Scrape it off using a pair of tweezers.
That's for eyeliner.
You could do just a black wing if that's all you have,
But i feel like to go along with the pink.
And monochrome type look that we have going on,
I wanna do a kind of muted cranberry type of color.
I'm gonna grab two different kylie liquid lipsticks.
We have a bright pink, just a bright red,
And then also a black gel liner.
And kind of mix together a little concoction.
To get a muted maroon.
I'm gonna grab my anastasia number 12 brush,
It's just an angled brush,
And dip right into this and use this color.
To draw my winged liner.
That is pretty much the upper lid all complete.
It was a little bit of a journey to get here,
But in the end,
I think this cut crease turned out really, really bomb.
Let's go ahead and move on to the lower lash line.
Using the same colors and brushes from before,
I'm gonna grab my m456 and dip into.
A little bit of love that and boutique.
And buff that right up along the lower lash line.
Just placing it right in there and.
Making sure to connect that up with the outer wing as well.
With my m433, gonna dip into skip.
I'm gonna pull this shadow down pretty far as well.
And really buff it out.
We are gonna be putting on glitter.
And i wanna make sure that there's.
Kind of a color behind it.
Be careful of any staining.
Before i move on to any glitter,
I'm gonna grab a little bit of the.
Jeffree star liquid lipstick in the shade drug lord.
And a tiny little detail brush,
This is the morphe m170-4 brush,
And using a tiny little bit of this on the back of my hand,
I'm going to use this to cut out my inner corner.
And also line my waterline.
I'm just gonna set that white in place.
Using a little bit more of pinkity drinkity.
Using a pencil brush, i'm gonna grab the shade literally.
And i'm going to use this color to highlight.
I'm just gonna place this color right over my brow bone.
And then right in that inner corner as well.
Then with another tiny detail brush,
I'm gonna dip into the shade sister,
Which is a metallic kind of rose gold color,
And i'm going to give that a quick little.
Spritz of prep and set and then.
Apply that shade right overtop of literally.
Wow, look at that.
Now i wanna go in and add little glitter,
Little glitter heart tears to this look.
If you guys remember a few months ago,
I did my recreating my follower's makeup looks video.
I did that rainbow cloud eye,
One of my favorite looks literally of all time.
I had little glitter tears dripping down from it.
I'm basically gonna do the same exact thing on this eye,
But all in a monochromatic pink.
I'm first just gonna dust off any.
Translucent powder that i have sitting and.
Baking on my face.
To draw in the little glitter tears,
I'm just gonna grab a tiny liner brush.
This one i literally still have in my.
Brush set from when i did my art supplies video.
Over a year ago now.
These ones are so good because they are so detailed.
Then just dipping into a little bit more of love that.
Oops.
I'm basically just gonna scribble these in down my cheek.
When i'm drawing these in,
I'm using a super, super light hand,
But then adding more pressure in certain areas.
Just so the color for one, isn't all even throughout.
And this is gonna give it kind of that.
Watercolor actual teardrop type of effect.
Then on top, i'm basically just going to.
Randomly apply an assortment of loose glitters.
These ones are from in your dreams cosmetics i believe.
This one is from violet voss and.
Then i also have these chunky glitters.
That i got i think from michael's.
They have tiny little pink heart glitters in here,
Which is perfect and i'm gonna glue these on the tears.
As if i'm crying hearts.
Starting with the tiny little hearts,
I'm just gonna use lash glue to dab them on.
If you have any really ridiculous pimples,
This is a great way to cover it right up.
Alright sisters, and i think that is one eye.
Of this anti valentine's day look all complete.
I love how this little glitter crying tears.
Cute crease turned out,
But that did take me quite a little bit of time.
Sorry for not talking very much.
I'm gonna quickly go off camera.
And do the other eye and be right as close as i can get,
Pop on a pair of lashes,
And i'll be right back to finish off the rest of the look.
And get into some sister special effects.
With cupid's arrows.
Alright sisters, we are back.
The eyes are looking relatively symmetrical right now.
And i also popped on a pair of lily lashes.
Miami so extras on the eye.
I think the eyes turned out so beautiful,
But now it is time to move on to the rest of the face.
Next up of course is going to be the highlighter.
We have to get our glow on,
Which i'm now realizing i probably should've done.
Before adding in the glitter tears.
Considering it's gonna overlap a little bit,
But it wouldn't be a james charles.
Video without some poor planning.
Let's do it.
I'm gonna grab the morphe prep and set setting spray.
And give my face a quick little spritz.
Just so the highlighter has something to stick to.
Then grabbing my morphe m501 brush,
I'm just gonna dip right into the shade literally.
From my palette and lay this down as.
Kind of a blush mixer pre-highlighter color.
Then using a jh30 brush,
I'm just gonna grab a little bit of a mixture of face.
And also a tiny bit of sister for a more.
Pink rose gold iridescent glow,
Give it a quick little spritz of prep and set.
And then just go right in overtop for a blinding glow.
If i can't attract the boys myself,
Maybe this highlighter will help.
Not with jokes like that, oh my god.
Little bit above the brow bone as always.
Then. down the center of my nose.
You guys, i don't know how my nose contour.
Looks this good right now and it's.
Probably never gonna look like this again.
So let's say a silent prayer and cherish this moment.
As we highlight using a pencil brush.
This is the m431 and a little bit more of face.
Now we get to move on to the lips.
For the lip, i do wanna stick with a nude color.
I know, kind of boring.
Of course you could do a maroon.
Or a darker color to match the liner,
But since we have so much going on.
And we're gonna add more in a few minutes,
I do think a nude will be a good option.
Before i do that though,
I am gonna grab the kylie liquid lipstick.
That we used beforehand for that bright pink,
This is say it no more, and use this to just line the lips.
So when we add the nude overtop,
It'll be a very pinky nude as opposed to.
A more peachy nude.
Honestly, it doesn't even look that bad, that pink,
But that's.a little much for me i think.
That was a rhyme.
It doesn't even look that bad, that pink.
But that's a little bit much for me i think.
On top of that,
I'm gonna add the ofra liquid lipstick.
In the shade sao paolo.
You guys know this is my all time favorite nude.
You can use code james for 30% off.
I'm just gonna layer this overtop to like i said,
Create a more nudey color out of this bright pink.
Then finally, just a little bit of drug lord.
Right in the middle for a nice highlight.
Alright sisters, that is pretty much this.
Valentine's day look all complete.
I'm now realizing that it would've been a lot smarter.
To add the glitter tears in the next step.
Along with the arrows to go from a.
Valentine's day wearable actually pretty look.
To a more non-wearable anti valentine's day look,
But guess who didn't think of that.
Me, so i guess this is your wearable.
Valentine's day look for today.
You could totally stop here.
Even with the glitter tears,
I think this look did turn out very, very beautiful,
But if are like me and you've been.
Single for a very, very long time, 19 years to be exact,
And you do not like this holiday anymore,
Keep on watching and let's add some special effects.
To make this an anti valentine's day look.
Jumping right in before we even get to the makeup portion,
I'm gonna teach you guys how to make.
The arrows super quickly.
Love being a cute little diy channel.
What you're going to need is red construction paper,
I just got this from literally the dollar store,
A pair of sister scissors, some super glue,
And then also a pair of chopsticks.
From the last time that you ordered chinese food.
Basically what i'm gonna do is start by.
Folding my construction paper right in half.
And then just using my pair of scissors,
I'm gonna cut out a.parallelogram, geometry, out of this.
Is that what it's called.
A parallelogram, four sides, definitely parallelogram.
If you open it up, you have the bottom of an arrow.
Wow, i am such a queen of diys.
Laurdiy is shaking.
Then i'm just gonna cut this shape right in half.
Again on the fold.
Now we have two and then we're just gonna.
Repeat that step one more time.
Now cut it in half.
Now i'm just gonna take my pair of chopsticks.
And rip them right in half just like that.
And then carefully, i'm just going to put a.
Tiny little bit of glue on the edge of this chopstick.
And i'm going to stick on the bottoms of the arrow.
Perfect.
While this dries, i have a roll of toilet paper.
Sitting right here that we're gonna use later on,
But i'm just going to stick this right in here.
And let it chill.
Just repeat the same exact process two more times.
For two more arrows.
We are back and all three arrows are complete.
I took my shirt off so we can do some.
Special effects stuff.
Unfortunately, that's gonna be all of the.
Shirt taking off that i'm gonna be doing this time of year.
These valentine's day jokes are getting so old already.
Oh my god.
We get it, i'm single forever.
Okay, moving on.
I'm just gonna take a really insanely.
Sharp pair of scissors.
Please be careful and use your parent's permission.
If you for some reason are recreating this look.
I'm basically just going to cut this here.
Okay.
Next i'm gonna grab a little bit of the.
Ben nye nose and scar wax.
Just gonna grab one of the brushes.
That i have laying out here and.
Grab a little chunk just like that.
Basically, what i'm going to do is.
Form this around the bottom of the arrow that we just cut.
So one, i don't stab myself with wooden shards,
But i'm also going to flatten the bottom edge just like that.
And kind of pinch it out so therefore.
When we stick the arrow to the skin,
It actually has a surface to glue to.
As opposed to just flopping down.
Once the piece is all set and has a flat bottom,
I'm just going to set this arrow off to the side.
And let that scar wax dry out a little bit.
Now we're gonna get started on the arrow holes.
If you've been subscribed for awhile,
You may have seen me do a few different.
Special effects things before.
I did the mermaid video, i did the melting skull video,
And i also did the video with the.
Twins and emma for halloween.
My knowledge when it comes to special effects.
Is really not that great at all and just saying.
That i really wanna learn a lot more about,
But those few things have allowed me.
To achieve basically every look.
That i've tried so far so we're good.
What i'm gonna start off with is a.
Little bit of ben nye liquid latex.
Just gonna pour a little bit of it.
Into the bottom of the cap.
Then just grabbing an old, dirty sponge.
That i was about to throw out anyway,
I'm just gonna dip it right into the cap.
I'm just going to dab this on right where.
I'm gonna place the first arrow hole.
Quickly before it dries,
I'm gonna grab a little bit of toilet paper just like this.
And basically rip a circular shard kind of, just like that,
And i'm just gonna stick it right overtop of that area,
Flatten it down using my hand.
Then just grabbing a little bit more liquid latex,
I'm going to go right in and just.
Press that right in and go over those edges.
Then we're just going to let this dry.
While that dries, i'm just gonna start prepping the.
Second arrow hole over here,
And then a hole right down here too.
To lock those in place,
I'm just gonna use a little bit of.
Translucent setting powder to make sure.
That none of the latex is still sticking.
Then just using a small concealer brush.
And a little bit of foundation of the back of my hand,
I'm going to quickly repaint over those areas.
To disguise the latex.
Now that the new skin is pretty much.
As disguised as we're gonna be able to get it,
We get to do the fun and also dangerous part.
So please be careful.
I'm gonna grab a tiny little pair of eyelash scissors.
And i'm basically going to cut a small hole in the skin.
Right in the middle of where the toilet paper is.
Once you get through,
You just kind of snip around a little bit.
And take some of the excess off to kind of form a hole.
That is pretty much exactly what you're going for.
It looks really, really gross, i know,
But we're gonna fill it up.
Now i'm going to grab the arrow.
Then grabbing a little bit of spirit gum,
This stuff is basically liquid adhesive.
It is what a lot of drag queens use to glue down their wigs.
Just gonna put a little bit of this.
Inside of the hole on my skin.
You actually activate this glue by tapping it,
So i'm just gonna kind of jiggle my finger in there.
A little bit just so it gets kind of tacky.
Then i'm also gonna put a generous layer of that.
On the bottom of the scar wax that we put on earlier.
And i'm going to tap that as well until it gets tacky.
Once it's looking pretty good,
I'm basically just going to take this arrow.
And carefully maneuver it right into the hole.
And then stick it to my forehead.
This is not going well.
Instead, we're going to figure this out.
I can superglue this to the thing,
But do you think that'll stick it to my head.
I don't care.
Let's go.
This is so not safe.
That's okay, don't do this at home.
Please stay, please stay, please stay.
Yas.
I am the queen of special effects, just let everybody know.
Before this literally falls off my head,
I have two different types of blood,
The liquid ben nye stage blood and.
The not liquid ben nye thick blood.
I'm gonna use a mixture of both of these.
To make it look like this is bleeding.
I'm just going to dab this around for the puncture wound.
This is also going to help hide.
The seams of the liquid latex too.
I'm gonna put some kind of going up.
The base of the arrow as well because.
If this were to actually fly into my head,
There would definitely be some sister splatter.
That is dark.
Gonna use my hand to tap out any excess.
And to kind of fade it in.
Then i'm just going to use some thick blood.
And this is going to go right inside of the hole.
This step is so gross and actually makes it look real.
The tendons are really just flying out for a real one.
That is one arrow all complete.
Oh my god you guys,
I cannot believe how freaking real and crazy this looks.
I'm gonna now do the other two quickly and carefully.
Before this one flies off and i'll be.
Right back with the finished look.
Alright sisters, several hours, lots of liquid latex,
And lots of superglue later,
That is this anti valentine's day look all complete.
Unfortunately for me, i am still very much single,
Which means cupid's arrows did not hit.
Any boys for me yesterday,
But i think he may have missed and hit me twice.
Because i am literally in love with.
How this makeup look turned out today.
And i really, really hope you guys enjoyed this video.
If you celebrated valentine's day yesterday.
With a significant other, it must be nice, cannot relate,
But hope you guys had a really fun and fresh time,
Wishing you the absolute best,
Or if you were like me and you are sister single,
I still hope you had a really fun time yesterday.
While having a boyfriend or girlfriend.
Does lowkey kind of sound pretty fun and fresh,
Don't rush it.
The right person will come when you least expect it.
And you guys will live happily ever after.
All that matters at the end of the day.
Is that you love yourself and hey,
You also got me, sister james here, loving you as well.
