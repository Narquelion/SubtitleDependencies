Complex device which gives us access to.
Almost all the information in the world.
And can be used to communicate with.
Other people do you think that's what.
They're doing in this picture i'm 14 and.

Lot about society i have an even smaller.
Wireless device that gives me access to.
Thousands of books and movies it's a.
Library card oh god there needs to be a.
Boomer subreddit dedicated to these.
Cartoons boomers loved cartoons more.
Than anything if you see a cartoon in.
This style you know it's gonna be.
Something about how kids are dumb do you.
Think that your attitude towards smart.
Phones might be an extension of your.
Fears that you along with your items and.
The leaves of yesteryear will become.
Obsolete that rather than simply.
Embracing both can change and age your.
Avoidance and decrying of advancing.
Technology will mask your slowly.
Depleting dude oh get ready doom boomers.
