Part of the channel now today we're.
Reviewing    design which it says.
Bad design but meant to freak you over.
Which is the worst kind.
That's like the most passive-aggressive.
Way to fly went over this actually makes.
Me want to be a designer just to mess.
With people there's so much bad design.
People don't understand how important.
Design is okay youtuber gets every.
Single video on his channel copyright.
Claim despite having the rights to all.
The music in his videos mumbo jumbo.
Mambo jump i loved his outro it was so.
Good.
Good this is so sad well it was based on.
One small sample that was part of his.
Outro right that was the issue it's so.
Moronic that it blows my mind problem.
Here is in youtube the problem is the.
Music industry what you use two seconds.
Of our clip that's mine mine the whole.
Youtube video that has nothing to do.
With it it blows my mind god and when i.
Think about i guess so angry.
Stop it felix stop it the stranger thing.
Season 1 blu-ray has an unskipable ad.
For season 2 that contains season 1.
Spoilers what the blu-ray why is that so.
Funny thank you for buying season 1.
Now buy season 2 government you owe as.
Money it's called taxes how much do i.
Owe.
Government you have to figure that out.
Me i just pay what i want government or.
No we know exactly how much you owe but.

When you sell step right or buy stuff or.
Higher stuff i generally it's just me or.
I have the simplest business of all time.
It's just me recording videos i don't.
Have that many driver new streams it's.
Not that complicated but still.
Government makes an estimate of v80.
Saying okay based on your income you.
Probably have to pay this amount in v80.
Which is pretty large amount of money.
It's like 20 percent or something but.
Surprise surprise.
I never have any v80 costs or taxes.
Because that's not how my business is.
Run but i still have to pay in advance.
This estimate that the government wants.
Me to pay and if i forget to pay it or.
If i don't pay it in time they charge.
You 20 percent of that amount.
It's a    scam like it's not taxes.
It's just a way to trick people into.
Paying money it's like a parking tickets.
And    i don't understand arviat he is.
It's a goods and service tax yeah.
Government we think you're gonna have to.
Pay this hundreds and thousands and v80.
Even though historically your business.
Never needs to pay it but we still want.
You to pay it and then we'll.
You back the money but if you don't pay.
Us in time we'll charge you 20 percent.
Of that amount because shame on you.
Because apparently you don't tax enough.

All the    time i blow it's yeah i.

Boohoo boohoo me i get free stuff but.
What the a fedex do is they're usually.
There's a charge for the package right.
There's a tax for whatever reason they.
Got two packs the package even though.
It's a gift technically or samples they.
Got a tax it well what they do is they.
Don't charge you or they don't ask you.
To pay they just send a letter saying.
You have to pay us for what what package.
They don't tell you and if we don't if.
You don't pay us pull up the price scam.
Why should i pay you i don't even know.
What i'm paying you for only if you.
Don't pay it's more money more money to.
Us it's only fedex and that's this dhl.
Ask for the money at least when you get.
The package so you know what you're.
Paying for like i wouldn't accept the.
Package if i knew i ever had to.
Pay taxes or detain you fedex hope you.
Die in a fire so to log back on to.

Budget flyers standing seats oh wow man.

Airlines going bankrupt anyway so i.
Don't know what their margins are or.
Because generally people don't care.
Right they just want to fly cheap as.
Possible so if consumers can fly more.
Cheaply and this is the option i'm sure.
People would do it plus it doesn't look.
Like you're standing you can still sit.

I'm stupid i can't buy single-use.
Plastic bags at the supermarket anymore.
But companies get away like this i mean.
To be fair how would they package that.
So people can find it right and not.
Steal it to be fair however the fact.
That you can't use plastic bags.
Supermarkets just freakin annoying but.
Does not help anyone i think i heard.
That plastic bag was a swedish invention.
There were went at it in sweden and.
There was a way to waste less paper.
Because they were stronger than paper.
Bags so the idea was that you can keep.
Using them and recycle them and just put.
Them in your pocket and then use them.
Again and and the thing with the cotton.
Bags is that they produce some what they.
Take so much water to produce cotton.
That you're doing much more harm to the.
Environment.
Getting a cotton bag unless you reuse it.
Like what 600 times or something like.
That instead of of just using the.
Plastic bags a couple more times that's.
