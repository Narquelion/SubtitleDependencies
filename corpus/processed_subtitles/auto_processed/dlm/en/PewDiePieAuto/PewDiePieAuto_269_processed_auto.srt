Go go go go go go go bhaga bhaga bhaga.
Good evening i'm pop it's more iya the.
New news anchor a few news our first.
Story comes from youtube youtube is.
Canceled that's right youtube is fine.
170 million dollars for collecting.
Children's personal data big oopsie very.
Large oopsie by youtube they have to see.
Fine google 136 million they are forced.
To pay an additional 34 million to the.
State of new york why i don't know.
Because they collect their children's.
Personal data this is actually an old.
Story that happened back in september.
But now it looks like it's affecting.
Everyone.
Every single person on the platform it's.
Pretty nuts i didn't think it was a big.
Deal at first but the more i look into.
It the more i realize this is actually a.
Huge deal.
Youtube has previously said that it's.
For 13 years and older if you sign up.
For youtube you can't do it unless.
You're over 13 i don't know exactly how.
It works but they have the kids app for.
People younger than 13 because it's.
Illegal to collect personal data on kids.
That's how youtube gets their.
Advertising revenue that's how i make my.
Money because you get targeted ads based.
On personal data which are obviously.
Much more worth than i don't know.
Normal ads i guess that's google's whole.
Business model if you didn't know that.
Well i don't know what to tell you.
So what the government of you would say.
Even though it's american base it still.
Applies the worldwide because obviously.
Youtube is located in america america.
Has this government-run facility called.
The ftc i don't know if this is correct.
But they have this i don't know what.
They call it an act called coppa which.
Is children's online privacy protection.
Act and it's to protect kids online.
Which makes sense you know i don't think.
Collecting kids data is good i don't.
Want that no one is arguing for that and.
I think it's really confusing to me.
Because obviously youtube has the kids.
App so what's the issue i assume what.
Happened was that youtube created kids.
App and said okay well this is where all.
The kids goes but then ftc comes back.
And be like actually you know what kids.
Are still watching youtube on you too.
This is not enough and that's why they.
Got the fine but then again why is it.
Youtubes fault that your kid is going.
Online decision american take on things.
It's never the parents fault it's always.
Someone else's fault.
So now what every youtube creator has to.
Do is they have to make a choice when.
They upload a video saying what's this.
Video made specifically for kids or was.
It not made specifically for kids and.
Youtube uploaded this video to instruct.
About you create content for youtube.
This video is very important to watch as.
It describes changes to the upload.
Process all of your existing videos and.
Potentially your monetization so what.
You have to do now so you have to go.
Into your advanced settings and you can.
Say no my videos isn't made for kids.
Epic okay fine that's almost a problem.
Right now youtube knows in addition to.
This setting will use machine learning.
Systems to help us find content that is.
Clearly made for kids that's cool.
Machine learning has always worked.
Really well in youtube is this like the.
Opposite hahaha apocalypse before you.
Kiddin make edgy constant now you're not.
Allowed to make family-friendly content.
It's so confusing well regardless you.
Know it seemed like the liability was on.
Youtube youtube is getting fine.
Mm-hmm-hmm federal trade commission made.
A statement and it's pretty shiny ology.
That i think of is the expression about.
Shooting fish in a barrel.
Youtube is the barrel and the content.
Creators are the fish did he just say.
He's gonna shoot us there will be.
Consequences jesus christ this guy is.
Terrifying there will be consequence.
What did i do we have a variety of tools.
At our disposal to cull through those 23.
Million channels and in an expeditious.
Way so when we talk about what does that.
Mean we are typically talking about.
Civil penalties not only can we sue.
Google and youtube for compliance with.
Coppa but also individual channel owners.
And content creators cool so not only.
Can they sue youtube they can sue people.
That upload content online.
Why my what that makes no sense control.
Your children please so i think the.
Maximum that fcc can sue you for is.
Fifty forty two thousand that's what i.
Heard at least but that's per video.
Basis i have five thousand videos on my.
Channel if twenty four videos get deemed.
By ftc is targeted for kids then i own.
Them one million dollars epic i forgot.
To mention so what happens if a video.
Gets made flag made for kids the video.
Will not get recommended by other videos.
Most of the revenue will be a removed.
From sixty to ninety percent of the.
Revenue is just caught off completely.
And all the comments will be removed.
From that video as well i mean when i.
First heard about i was like oh well i.
Never purposely made content for kids i.
Never try and direct my content for kids.
But then at the same time youtube now.
Has changed their format so you can't.
Swear edgy content is really not allowed.
So you're kind of forced to be.
Family-friendly but now it seems you're.
Getting punished for it you could.
Possibly get a lawsuit it's so crazy.
And then first again at first my initial.
Reaction was like yeah you know what if.
I understand ftc there's a lot of.
Clearly 100% clearly in my opinion.
Content that is made for kids on the.
Platform which is very profitable and.
Very very lucrative i mean you got.
Morgues i can't see anyone over the age.
Of 12 watching morgues and it's always.
Kind of weird like why is that on.
Youtube why is that not on the kids app.
Isn't that what the kids have is for.
Right in case you didn't know this the.
Most profitable channel on youtube is.
Ryan's toy review which is a.
Seven-year-old unboxing toys that's.
Clearly made for kids okay no add up.
That let that's an obvious case in my.
Opinion what the finding is we are.
Inside a pc knights part he's passed out.
In the back regina what did you do i.
Didn't you got until battle royale with.
A bunch of huggers and they did this to.
Him.
I don't see anyone over the age to tell.
Watching this is either sorry chat but i.
Think he knows these are clearly made.
For kids right and it always weirded me.
Out and even jake paul you know i.
Remember a nerd seated it did a really.
Good video on this where he showed just.
How jake paul is marketing to kids all.
These colored areas is him talking about.
Plug for different merchandise and.
Different products and touring this is.
All promos for kids and jake paul.
Himself even said what his audience is.
I'd say it's like eight years old to.
Like 16 years old and so that's why okay.
Ladies and gentlemen we got him a fake.
Now here's what he changed for me.
Because youtube is already starting to.
Strike down on videos and and flagging.
Them as kit for kids only and by the way.
What happens if the video gets flagged.
For kids only or specifically made for.
Kids it means you get caught up from.
Recommended you're not allowed to read.
The comments anymore and most of your.
Revenue is gonna go away probably.
Between sixty to ninety percent of your.
Revenue is gonna be gone.
So it's hits a pretty significant change.
It's hitting people that i don't think.
Deserve it like this channel for example.
Pixel ban his content was flagged by it.
He does figurines he shows figurines old.
Toys it doesn't strike me as for kids at.
All when i watched it but i guess since.
His toys that makes it liable and that.
Shows kind of where the line is drawn on.
He tweeted that his watchmen figurine.
Was made for kids his south park series.
Made for kids south park's i was really.
Wrong i'm like oh so it's not for kids.
No way it is they specified it for kids.
Obviously youtube is gonna do wrong but.
At the same time goddamn this really.
Shows and it's not just him there was.
Another figurine channel jang bricks for.
Example who just like lego builds adults.
Can enjoy this stuff i enjoy this stuff.
It's like mximo fooders pokemon a card.
Autoboxing he's clearly not made for.
Kids but it wouldn't surprise me if he.
Gets flying as well delightful who made.
The point of why am i supposed to swear.
Now is that what's happening because i'm.
Doing four dull videos it again.
Sure may be kids watching but how is.
That hurtful they're clearly not.
Directed to kids at least.
Not the vibe i got artistic preference.
Of course but i prefer exaggerated or.
Simplified characters faces -.
Realistically sculpted one so seeing.
That is this it makes it very very very.
Annoying even cypher dentists well who's.
Done animation on my channel they are on.
My channel.
They got flat as made for kids what.
Because it's a cartoon because it's.
Animation think about all the animators.
On youtube now are they gonna like.
Youtube.
Don't make edgy content also youtube.
Don't make family-friendly content feels.
Like a joke at this point i think jack.
Is a good example too cuz i think people.
Have this idea that jack is.
Family-friendly or because he plays.
Games or whatever but in reality he.
Swears a lot he drops a freaking c word.
Or is ftc gonna be able to see that.
Nuance and be like oh well he plays.
Minecraft so adults can enjoy kids games.
It's not a kids game kids just like it.
That's not my fault.
Me when i rewatched pewdiepie videos and.
Forgot he used to swear line yeah i.
Stopped swearing in my videos and since.
It's my bread and butter if i upload it.
Once a month and had like a brand deal.
Yeah it wouldn't matter but i'm not.
Gonna lose revenue just to say    it.
Just seems so stupid but now it's my.
Minecraft video who's gonna again i.
Don't understand another thing i have.
Figurine an unboxing collection i don't.
Think it's for kids but looking at how.
Youtube is looking at these videos how.
Do you respond to that it feels like i'm.
Supposed to hit this is made for kids.
Even though i don't think it is and then.
If ftc says oh by the way you flagged.
This as for kids we're gonna sue you or.
Whatever i know this is a problem.
Improbable thing that will happen but.
Still it would make me legally liable.
Isa if i flag it for kids right because.
That's admitting guilt that's admitting.
Yo yeah no i think you're right when i.
Don't think it's right so i'm just.
Forced to remove this video instead.
That's like the only thing i know how to.
Deal with this i love this to eat me.
Trying to make roblox videos for fun the.
Ftc stop right there criminal scum.
Nobody breaks the law and my watch i'm.
Confiscating your stolen goods now pay.
Your fine or it's off to jail there's.
Ryan's tour review and then there's.
People making content that kids maybe.
Enjoys what the hell are they supposed.
To do about that it makes no sense and.
It's only also saw this tweet honestly.
The whole thing is backwards.
Access the common suggestion - a user.
Should be done on a per account basis.
Not her video basis yes thank you.
There's so many channels on youtube that.
Make really good family-friendly content.
Is that not a thing anymore and i think.
It's one of these things where we just.
Gonna have to wait and see and and see.
How ftc enforces this if you're a.
Smaller channel i wouldn't i guess i.
Don't know i know one thing for sure is.
For sure what's up my 19 year olds.
That's right your 19 year old now.
Congratulations.
Dammit i can't believe it.
They grow up so fast you can comment on.
This proposition and leave your feedback.
If you want to i love this by the way in.
In their presentation as example slang.
And pop-culture phrases such as fun free.
Stuff whatever cool duh duh you know i.
Use ironic family-friendly jokes in my.
In my minecraft series like clip clop.
And i say all this like childish work.
Words as a joke are they gonna be able.
To tell that i don't know stop why is.
Youtube air always like this always can.
You imagine these channels that are.
Making like figurine or lego or whatever.
Just like that livelihood ching chong.
Being bong you know what i mean not that.
Big.
Next news oh my god if i go on twitter.
This is what i see these anime avatar.
Kids are just absolutely relentlessly.
Calling me i trans folk on twitter i.
Like this person with the most retweets.
Who then admitted no i didn't watch the.
Video epic so why am i transform well.
Because i allegedly purposely.
Misgendered someone it was in my dr.
Phil video zoomer thinks his mom is too.
Irrelevant this video i got claim by the.
Way r.i.p i'm glad we went through all.
This extensive effort to try and try and.
Get it monetize regardless this person.
Who to me so clearly was a jeffree star.
Wannabe or look-alike or inspired.
Whatever and i honestly i don't even.
Think about it because she had a.
Masculine name her name was bama and and.
I looked it up.
Bam aaron is a boy's name so he's not.
That weird to think they would be.
Referred as a he.
And she wasn't mentioned as she anywhere.
By anyone in the video so it's not that.
Weird if i did i would have noticed and.
I would have changed it but no i'm a.
Transfer okay.
Did you not know that i didn't watch the.
Video but pewdiepie is a transform i.
Know what his intent is at every point.
You know i actually support lgbt i would.
Never and i could have been more careful.
But i would never purposely misgender.
Someone as a way to antagonize her troll.
Like but i wouldn't do that same with.
Sexuality that's not that's not okay you.
Shouldn't do it either i wouldn't do it.
But these dumbass.
Anime avatar kids on twitter i mean your.
Brains are not fully developed clearly.
You're just making noise you're not.
Helping anyone just wait for everyone to.
Respond now oh well you should be more.
Responsible yeah maybe you didn't do it.
On purpose but it should wait it's the.
Same    all over again go.
Yourself that's it.
Alright that was my de beaut popish.
Moria here hope you guys enjoyed pew.
News i think i have a long prosperous.
Future as a news anchor i know i said i.
