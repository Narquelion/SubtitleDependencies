Little bit into google trends but i want.
To really dig deeper.
I want to truly understand why everyone.

So let's find out.
Cool maybe my channel is dying cuz i.
Can't ride it pewdiepie oh my god.
Well it looks like i'm not the only one.
With this problem by type you who the.
Hell is pie type you know reading.
Youtuber pie dipu he's my favorite he's.
So funny he's so good alright let's just.
Go into this so here we get an interest.
Overtime grant pretty interesting i.
Would say you know it's it's there you.
Don't really get the full picture unless.
You hit the whole graph so let's start.
Up here in 2012 this is where i'm nice i.
Guess i started becoming more popular.
I'm not exactly sure what they represent.
What but i hit my peak at 2014 what.
Happened in 2014 i need to understand so.
Someone made a playlist i guess i played.
Games in 2014 no controversy no nothing.
Huh i'm actually in the same room.
Nothing's changed five years jesus.
Christ when did i become the biggest.
Channel in 2013 damn it's been a long.
Time it's 2013 and then i i peaked in.
2014 and then it all just it all just.
Went down i think it's interesting to.
Note at least for me cuz anyone that.
Came before me almost every single.
Channel that has been before me has is.
Disappeared okay everyone that's been.
Bigger than me they've all they're all.
Gone because of this fact i've always.
Just looked at youtube like it could end.
At end.
Like i should just be ready to pack my.
Dad bags out any day.
I actually oh wait let me see if i can.
Find that sorry i'm this is video is.
Just gonna be one giant engine so i did.

Found the presentation where is it.
Beautiful faces of horror okay so how.
Did i get to where i am full time job to.
Videos every day do something different.
Let myself into the game blocks so what.
Happens in the future i thought it was.
Interesting how i kind of questioned how.
It was something stable or not with laws.
And regulations and copyright i thought.
These things would hit quicker i really.
I was so unsure whether he would even be.
Allowed to monetize the gameplay on.
Youtube i think it's it's one of those.
Things where people really fought for.
And to try and convince companies as.
Well that it's benefit fitting for them.
Like these big cup publishers like ea.
But that's that whatever they benefit.
From people playing their game and they.
Them understanding that has really had a.
Huge impact on on youtube and gaming i.
Can easily see it go in another way.
Where gaming would just not be allowed.
On youtube and i that's always been in.
The back of my head you know and now in.
The future 2019 nothing's really changed.
Its article 13 all these stuffs.
Happening i think this is where wall.

Interested by this okay so we now know.
We're failing but that doesn't mean we.
Give up goddammit.
Subscribe god damn it i need a hundred.
Million there's another website that.
Lets you look at statistics and.
Analytics of course socialblade i used.
To be obsessed with social blaine and i.
Think a lot of youtubers are a lot of.
Youtubers go on social blade and they.
Look at their own stats and they compare.
It to other people and they they.
Frantically i think that makes a lot of.
People really really depressed why my.
Lack finke what's wrong with me.
It's just that imagine that you have a.
Job and how well you are performing in.
That job is 100% public and 100%.
Comparable to all your peers like.
There's some deep psychological.
Emotional stress that is always.
Lingering for a lot of youtubers i.
Literally have not gone on social blade.
In like four years i just stopped i.
Don't know why what happened.
After a while it just luckily it just.
Ironically it hit me it doesn't matter.
Like i don't care how many subscribers i.
Have it doesn't matter and i don't have.
To waste time just obsessing about this.
Stuff but i do remember i used to obsess.
About this stuff and i think a lot of.
Youtubers do especially comparing.
Themselves so my views are up yay my.
Subscribers are doing estimated monthly.
Earnings it seems about right i used to.
Complain so much when i saw these.
Estimated monthly earnings but like.
That's ridiculous.
How can i possibly make that much money.
And then clearly i have been very poorly.
Monetizing my channel like before i.
Would make 4-minute videos you barely.
Make any money on those like that's.
Impossible how can everyone make so much.
Money oh oh i'm not monetizing my.
Channel oh okay cool well maybe that's a.
Part of the reason 21 billion views.
That's nuts dude okay so what i.
Really want to investigate here is the.
Top.
Subscribers who's gaining the most.
Subscribers right now okay 300,000 in a.
Day jesus christ.
Knowledge tv teach me clearly i need to.
Become indian i'm beginning to see a.
Pattern here okay well that was.
Analytics with pdp i hope you guys.
Thought this was interesting i've.
Literally uploaded every single day for.
As long as i can remember taking minimum.
Breaks as much as i can possibly take.
Take it's crazy to me how i still enjoy.
It i don't get it either.
Why am i here it's fun i don't know what.
To tell you one thing that i am thinking.
About is like i've never had a proper.
Break like i never had a long break.
Where i'm just a normal person.
That isn't constantly thinking about.
Youtube but literally if i took a break.
It would kill my channel the way youtube.
Is shaped at this point it's like you.
Just have to keep making videos.
Otherwise there won't be anything to.
Come back to we've seen this happen.
Through so many youtubers they go on a.
Break and then hey guys what's up oh.
Everyone is gone oh no didn't light and.
Leave the algorithm made it so you know.
That's always a fun lingering fact at.
The back of your mind bring youtuber.
It's such an easy job you guys don't.
Understand it doesn't even matter we're.
All gonna be replaced by ai in the.
Future this has been pewdiepie analytics.
Subscribe goddammit.
