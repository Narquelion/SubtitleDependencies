Well boys we did it i'm banned from.
China.
That's right after i spoke about the.
Hong kong protest.
And showed their leader being mocked as.
Looking like winnie the pooh i got.
Banned from china that's right now if.
You search anything pewdiepie related.
On any reddit related forum in china.
Or youtube related videos it will just.
Be completely blank.
I'm laughing but yeah i'm sorry if you.
Are in china and try to watch my videos.
That's that kind of sucks it's just kind.
Of funny.
Like i knew it was gonna happen the.
Music artist zed got bad in china just.
Because he.
Liked the south park tweet so obviously.
Me talking about the hong kong memes.
Was gonna get me banned but you know.
Who's not banned in china.
Bart baker that's right.
I stumble upon this thanks to joel and.
It's the most confusing thing.
I have ever seen.
Music.
Foreign.
Music.
I like that he changes his own english.
To just fit the chinese market so.
Bart baker for those who don't know bart.
Baker this is beautiful.
This is the best thing i've seen ever i.
Saw this and i'm like this has to be a.
Joke.
But it's so obviously not a joke bart.
Baker.
Uh has 10 million subscribers on youtube.
He's done a parody of.
Practically everything i'm not going to.
Play his songs because it'll get.
Copyrighted but.
You know he's collaborated with stevo.
Joey graceffa.
His parodies are not bad it's not my.
Type of humor but.
Some of them are actually good i'll give.
Him that bartbaker's channel has.
3 billion views but now.
Music.
She can sing we check this style out.
Music.
Applause.
Music.
I am obsessed as one could ever.
Now bart records himself with face.
Filters.
Translating chinese songs into english.
She can sing.
But check this out that seems to be a.
Winning formula for bart.
Okay that guy's voice is awesome but.
Check this out.
Notice how he keeps changing the side of.
The microphone that's the correct way of.
The microphone i have the same one but.
I guess he realized it looks cooler if.
You hold the microphone the wrong way.
Laughter.
I don't know why i'm pointing that out.
But that's like the least embarrassing.
Thing out of all of this.
You can always go on tour mr baker.
Please get out of live streaming.
At the next contract if you sign five.
Year term or higher.
You wouldn't be able to leave unless you.
Pay millions to the company.
Oh how far have you fallen oh god it's.
So bizarre.
Music.
Applause.
Hit that follow button and make sure to.
Like this let's see if we notice how his.
Eyes just got bigger.
Because the face filter discovered it.
Music.
Okay hold on that's cool but check this.
Dollar.
Music.
It sounded better before bart i'm sorry.
Well we know why now because vice did a.
Documentary.
About him and it's pretty sad and i'm.
Not gonna lie it's.
Pretty sad.
Come on come on.
Ready let's go let's go bart works from.
Home.
And he's got a routine wake up early.
Walk the dog grab coffee wow he's so.
Cool.
And get to do what he's always done best.
This feels like you're watching a.
Delusional superstar.
Right and why why is this the face you.
Make when you put in.
Anything in your eye like why is it.
Impossible to touch your eye without.
Opening your mouth.
I know that's a side track but it i will.
It always bothers me.
By 8 am he's already clocked in oh yeah.
Vandal dropped wall.
Do you love china why don't work why do.
You think i got huawei.
Why huawei nihao.
Laughter.
That's how you know you truly love china.
If you have a huawei.
Nothing to do with sponsorships.
I see you tomorrow or maybe i'll see you.
Tonight i don't know i'll see you in the.
Morning.
What what was that sentence.
Jesus jesus.
This is satire because if it is it's so.
Brilliant.
It's genius bart was a classic youtube.
Success story.
His specialty was parody music videos.
Imitating pop stars like taylor swift.
And justin bieber he'd get tens of.
Millions of hits on his most popular.
Videos.
Right some of bart's most popular songs.
Have 200 million views like if he got a.
Sponsor in that.
That would be a lot of money i assume he.
Doesn't get those numbers anymore and.
That's why he turned to this.
But a couple years ago youtube started.
Dropping channels that weren't family.
Friendly from their preferred program.
In order to attract advertisers is this.
My fault bart.
I'm sorry suddenly big name youtubers.
Like bart.
Saw the revenue drop to a fraction of.
What it used to be.
I don't think that's necessarily the.
Issue the issue is that now.
Short videos are not as monetizable as.
Longer ones.
Youtube youtube changed in 2016 was it.
That they want more watch time instead.
Of views so content that.
That gets a lot of numbers and isn't as.
Valuable.
As longer videos that's just how it is.
Music videos aren't long.
They don't make many much money it's.
Like lasagna.
Has like 200 million views but it's.
Probably.
Made less money than this video and it.
Used to be fine on youtube.
Actually like the more edgy it was the.
Better.
Fast forward a year and a half maybe and.
You know i'm like super miserable uh.
Going to a therapist.
Because youtube yeah yeah you don't know.
How many youtubers are depressed.
If bart is happier doing uh chinese.
Content i'm happy for him don't get me.
Wrong.
Like i get it youtube is very stressful.
If you're not on top of what you're.
Doing you're done and that's just the.
Reality of the.
Of being a youtuber and that puts a lot.
Of pressure on you so.
So anyway all this    was going on and.
I was super unhappy and i get an email.
And it's like um.
We're a company from china we think you.
Could be very big in china.
I gotta listen to the song they sent me.
And then i have to translate it and then.
I have to record it then i have to shoot.
The video.
Then i have to edit it it's like it's.
Back to the basics.
But in china how do you change it i put.
The chinese into google translate.
And then i have to make all the words.
Rhyme so that's what the fans are into.
That's what got the uh accounts really.
Popular.
Music.
The world is passing by the.
Tide is rushing how much of this are you.
Able to do when it.
You don't actually know what's being.
Said in chinese.
Oh it's all i don't know any of it red.
Death star rolling.
Red dust red dust red dust i get that a.
Lot a lot of red dust.
And these lyrics i know i'm that red.
Dust you get scattered by.
This company in china what was it that.
They liked about you.
They said that the first thing they do.
Is look at how you look.
What do you think they're looking for.
Well with a western.
Person i mean blonde hair helps this.
Isn't even my real hair color.
So basically they like nothing about you.
Like.
Anyone can get a blonde hair dye this.
Died i dyed my hair the day before that.
Video got 30 million views.
And then that video hits so hard how.
Much of the success.
What is he talking about can be.
Attributed to the fact that you're white.
A small amount to start a good amount to.
Start actually.
A tiny porsche actually it's pretty yeah.
It's good it's good actually.
It's good being white in china okay so.
Bart explained that.
They came to him because they saw.
Potential here's what they actually said.
About bart which is the saddest thing.
What makes you decide.
This guy i can make him a hit here um.
We didn't think he was anything special.
He's so mean.
He's not very happy.
About this.
Bitay and bart would make their money.
But in order to be brand friendly.
Bart's gotta be child friendly china.
You're awesome.
This one's for you and some of bart's.
Biggest hits so far are patriotic songs.
About china oh.
Music.
Might say something politically that.
Would get.
You and him in trouble that he just.
Doesn't know that's wrong yet.
Yeah definitely don't say anything about.
Hong kong grace resentment.
Life and death by a few.
Can be seen.
Music.
That was okay you're trying to hit the.
Inga.
How is this real and all that hard work.
Might just pay off for bart.
He's all in he's even moving to china.
This week.
Music.
That's a wrap a lot easier than youtube.
Video.
Is it really he just looks like a.
Middle-aged white guy who is.
So lost in life it's sad how the person.
Who made everyone laugh is depressed now.
Bart looks like he's dying in the inside.
But he yeah i mean.
What did he say when he stopped the.
Video okay.
Hope you'll get warm i'll see you.
Tomorrow or maybe i'll see you tonight i.
Don't know i'll see you in the morning.
Bye.
Jesus jesus.
Ah this dude looks 40 and 18 at the same.
Time.
This is the thing everyone in life is.
Driven to do what they.
Think makes them happy but that will.
Take some people on some very.
Strange paths i want to watch some more.
Of his videos.
Music.
Okay that sounds amazing but check out.
The english.
Is a version that i can't shake you from.
My mind.
But you brush me off it makes me wanna.
Cry.
Stop with the silence please girl tell.
Me why.
But maybe you've already.
Music.
I think this just shows just how.
Competitive it is online.
And that you you need a niche and bart.
Has.
Found one i guess bart baker promotes.
Anti-americanism.
In china you guys asked for it so we're.
Doing it today we're going to the huawei.
Store to get a p30 pro.
And destroy the iphone.
Music.
Well now i don't need an apple iphone.
You guys think i can get away.
Wearing that or do you think that might.
Be a problem that t-shirt.
By the way come here this is a real.
Iphone this isn't fake this is my phone.
This is my new phone baby.
Music.
This thing is broken well i want one.
Oh my god you did this youtube you did.
This.
Bart baker and bio bi is he like a big.
Deal or something.
Bart is literally that that one guy that.
Appears in other people's songs and.
You're like.
Wait who is that where did they come.
From he's that of china.
Bart became what he's making fun of an.
Idol.
God if this was parody it would be i.
Would respect it so much.
Well i wonder who's next on the train.
Maybe jake paul.
You know if it becomes more beneficial.
To make these videos than youtube i mean.
People.
Are gonna do it maybe bart is just a.
Trendsetter you know.
Maybe he's just the the first who.
Saw the potential that would be funny.
Too i can never join him in a step.
Because i'm bad in china.
This is so sad.
Music.
Music.
Oh god.
Laughter.
Oh my god all right honestly behind this.
Seems bart seems like a.
Decent dude i don't have any quarrel.
With him everyone's gonna get bread on.
That.
Table and i guess he's found his niche.
So props to him.
I kind of hope this turns out to be a.
Joke because that would make it.
Really brilliant i don't i'm pretty sure.
It isn't.
Which makes it even funnier so i hope.
