Oh bro ganga welcome everyone.
Ten years ten years.
Manitoba silence ten freaking years we.
Did it if you don't know why i'm saying.
Ten years my channel just hit its.
Ten-year anniversary i've been uploading.
Consistently on youtube for ten years i.
Think even longer but technically i.
Started pd pi channel ten years ago.
Amazing thank you for watching i wonder.
How many of you have watched for like 10.
Years you literally grew up with me it's.
Pretty weird to think about i sometimes.
See comments and people being like.
Alright i watched you when i was like 14.
And i'm 20 now it's like i don't know.
Why that's so weird to me well skip all.
This sappy.
First i want to just i'm gonna go.
Through each year i want to watch a.
Video from every year that and kind of.
See what the difference are i think it's.
Kind of funny to look how much has.
Changed over 10 years i almost at just.
10 years like it's a short time or.
Something and i wanted to look at some.
Videos that i private it for whatever.
Reason make it maybe a bit more.
Interesting i found this one call of.
Duty black ops team deathmatch 48 for.
Season score i smash liked on it myself.
I can't read the comments because i i.
Pry veted it but let's put a public.
Again alright what are the comments no.
Comments.
That's so sad a ton review so that's.
Pretty good everyone keeps referencing.
My first video as if i played minecraft.
Just because it's the first one on my.
Channel no this is what i did i played.
Call of duty like everyone else was.
Doing but it was fun i said to myself.
Like is it a good idea to use a warlord.
And you will mags with suppressor.
Because yeah that's really interesting.
Alright let's move forward it's fun but.
Yeah probably why people are hating on.
Them is because they die of them so.
Was i talking about the helicopter.
That's how i make sense of it and they.
Shut it down anyway so it doesn't really.
Come on let's see some good gameplay i'm.
Curious now i think and my dog hates me.
I got no feels i hate oh try to knife me.
Why i do wrong what am i talking about.
No consistency the nuke though no.
Coherent thoughts i remember when i got.
My to be fair though this was kind of.
The style at the time i remember i.
Watching other people that were.
Successful on as call of duty commentary.
It's the same sort of style like like.
Huh i said that that's weird so even.
Though i find it's very cringing i was.
Just mimicking what was popular at the.
Time all right first nuke.
I was so excited i was screaming you.
Know everything i was like mom you have.
To come see this she was like no all.
Right i'm gonna stop it right there.
Okay he doesn't tell me at 2010 i think.
I had about 100 subscribers or maybe.
Something like that i remember someone.
Else like a big youtuber referenced in a.
Tweet somewhere saying like oh i.
Remember when i only had 300 subscribers.
And i was like    only 300 i'm.
Sitting here at 100 do you know how hard.
This is like this is a long time to do.
Something without getting any disability.
Something clearly happened in 2011 let's.
Find out okay so this is me playing our.
Winni and i titled it funny that is very.
Funny.
Laughter.
Music.
This is like the mark sample ice isn't.

Might say was this funny by the way i.
Was sitting on the floor here holy crap.

Moved into this place myanmar since no.
Is this before maybe i don't know for.
Exactly when i did but i remember.
Sitting on the floor because we didn't.
Have a table it was so tiny i was like.
I'm better off on the floor that's funny.
Full circle gamers laura gave her life i.
Told you i'm consistent.
I told you so let's jump to 2012 i was.
At is that possible 3 million already.
Damn it was the time when i was in.
Sweden that's why i had this video here.
Because look what i found.
Going through privates i found a video.
That i made for myers yet i would send.
Her videos because she'd really liked it.
Yeah this is to crunch dough and i don't.
Really want to show it but i want to see.
Like a little bit alright i can't i'm.

Welcomed so now we're in italy i moved.
To mindset to italy that was part of the.
Deal she stayed in sweden for a while.

Was really fun that actually i filmed.
This is so weird i can't play a tune.
There it's not friday i would never get.
It on friday did i remember i got so.
Much hate during this time because my.
Channel just blew up and that was kind.
Of like the cringy i mean i was never.
Family-friendly but a lot of kids.
Obviously watched me cuz i it was just.
Swearing constantly that was the humor.
And loud noises it obviously attracted a.
Lot of young audience it's a lot of.
People are like who's this in screechie.
Annoying prick so i would say between.
2012 and 2013 it was one i probably had.
The most fun because it was just me and.
My audience and pure acceleration but.
Then a lot i remember like a lot of.
Haters would sit in and it would be i've.
Never dealt with that before as well so.
I didn't really know i didn't have the.
Tools to deal with it they didn't bother.
Me that much but i remember it was kind.
Of tough because he felt like oh.
Everyone just thinks i'm a dumbass.
