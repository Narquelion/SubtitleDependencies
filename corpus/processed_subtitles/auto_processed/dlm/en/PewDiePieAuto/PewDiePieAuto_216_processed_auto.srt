Oh cancel culture left and right people.
Are getting cancelled who's next.
Felix kjellberg i'm coming for you.
You're about to get came so you're done.
I know all your secrets oh.
Laughter.
Not funny should not joke about serious.
Things sorry i forgot today we're doing.
A video on you belays should we cancel.
Celebrities for their crimes where they.
Discuss about canceled culture they'll.
Gather people in a room some are for.
Canceled culture other people are.
Against it let's say what they have to.
Say and i hope i can give some insight.
As well as a youtube egg big person.
Let's go our kelly bye i'm done with you.
Get out of here like but that's in your.
Opinion i'm not saying i'm here for our.
Our kelly i just think if you support.
Him your dick right yeah and then there.
You go everyone everyone hates our kelly.
No matter what sight on the spectrum.
You're on we can all agree our kelly is.
Done this should be a fruitful.
Conversation it's so funny because on.
The internet everyone loves to be so.
Divided we have it's basically like.
Everyone is driving into cars so it's.
Okay to yell at each other but you get.
People that don't agree on the topic in.
The same room and all the sudden i think.
This is a natural human trait that we we.
Are naturally agreeable it's kind of.
Funny i just threw that in there for no.
Reason it's just an observation that has.
Nothing to do with the point okay let's.
Keep watching.
Yeah i guess.
Guess who there cancel culture people.
Are.
Be a liability eilish stand over here.
Doesn't like our kelly hello my name is.
A deep kadir he's amped about science to.
City and i'm a product manager in the.
Tech industry hi i'm will kourt i'm a.
Music student at usc hi i'm joy villa.
I'm a singer-songwriter and i am anti.
Cancel culture like i she said that i'm.
Actually anti mm-hm they got a nice.
Diverse group i was saying and i should.
Be interesting ish cancel culture more.
On this i'd been looking forward to this.
Conversation hi i'm seth fowler law.
School graduate there's a hot take i'm.
Against cancel culture but everyone.
Everyone that is for canceled culture.
Needs to be canceled they need a taste.
On their own medicine we'll get into it.
I have so much to say about this we'll.
Get into it.
I would buy an artist work even if they.
Committed a violent crime mm-hmm i would.
Be inclined to say no because obviously.
I don't want to support anyone that does.
Violent crimes but on the second hand.
It's very circumstantial what if they're.
Defending themselves then i think is.
Fair game but then on the other hand i.
Probably supported a lot of rappers that.
Done for violent crimes.
It's like rappers are not part of a big.
Group let's get real here it's teenage.
Girls in charge of any cancer culture.
Movement feel free to tell me if i'm.
Wrong there's a reason trap hasn't been.
Cancelled yet let's get real here humans.
Are a series of impulses on a spectrum.
Of time like we are constantly changing.
We're constantly evolving i have any of.
You have honestly never not told a lie.
In your life of course we evolved us so.
Are you a liar today boom what an.
Argument that's a great point actually.
That new ones has never put today you.
Can tell clearly with people digging up.
Old videos and using that.
As evidence if we want to do castle.
Culture i feel like we need like a.
Certain time we need to get more.
Organized as what i'm saying certain.
Time frame i guess that's the thing like.
You know a shane is someone getting.
Cancer right now and you know you watch.
It clips and you're like jeez but it.
Doesn't say when they're made or and.
Stuff like that same with jenna you know.
You watching her like but then knowing.
Oh that was actually 9 or 10 years ago.
That to me at least i'd changes things.
Online and especially if i know that.
Person has grown out of that that.
Doesn't make it okay what they did but.
At the same time i don't see a pretty.
Reason dragging someone to the dark.
Because of it i'm trying to argue both.
Sides here like i think it's good that.
There's a clear line of what's okay.
Today by maybe referencing things in the.
Past but i also don't think there's a.
Good reason to cancel something for what.
They did in my mind's eye i don't know i.
Don't say anything.
Yeah damn it i haven't thought about.
This properly i think the issue with.
Canceled culture is it's kind of like.
This like you have a cut on your arm.
Let's just chop the whole arm off yeah.
It's also i like this guy's got good.
Points i like that very good good.
Metaphors it's true he's not wrong he's.
Not wrong he's right the amount of.
People that work on some of these.
Projects like think of like a harvey.
Weinstein movie right he did terrible.
Things i wouldn't want to port support.
Harvey weinstein but most of his victims.
Are people that were in his movies by.
Not supporting the harvey weinstein.
Movie are also not supporting his.
Victims so it's kind of like you're in a.
Weird spot it sounds like a weird.
Argument but i actually agree with him.
Because for me example i mean oh.
Honestly harvey weinstein movies a.
Hundred percent.
There will be more movies they will be.
Okay but at the same time looking at.
From my perspective with the scare.
Pewdiepie getting cancelled i feel.
Terrible about every one that worked and.
I hundreds of people that never got to.
Show all this all the guests that we.
Have all that so many people on the set.
Planning organizing money all this stuff.
That never got to show anything for it.
Because of me and that doesn't feel fair.
To them and i'm sorry like honesty is.
Point but with hard.
One scene that you can't bring down the.
Kingpin without bringing down the.
Organization that he built i guess.
That's the problem now everyone is a.
Kingpin apparently you got a youtube.
Channel it's like people are massively.
Overestimating our influence when it's.
Convenient and massively undermining it.
When they feel like it.
Ahem he's just irrelevant.
Can you believe he posted this for his.
Hundred of millions of subscribers many.
Times i hear that whenever it's.
Convenient the argument switches it's.
Great so he said something very.
Interesting to me about like the whole.
Cutting off the arm and to fix a cut and.
I feel like the exact opposite because.
When you talk about how like you get.
Another arm is that what you meant oh if.
You're canceling people bond they have.
Good inventions it's like there's so.
Many smart people there are so many.
Smart people that's where you're wrong.
That's why i can't cancel culture exists.
There's too many dumb people that's the.
Problem oh my god remember last year.
When james charles was cancelled and the.
Entire world was so sure that he was a.
Creditor and the amount of people that.
Spread that message around causing him.
To almost end up being suicidal did we.
Learn anything from that no no one.
Learned anything absolutely nothing if.
Anything is his worst now did we learn.
Maybe we shouldn't point fingers before.
We know the full truth no no that does.
Not happen anymore those days are over.
Powers in our hands and i feel like for.
Me i'm doing my part by not choosing not.
To like mess with that person anymore.
Look how conveniently they're putting.
This what a hat facts argument right.
That is not cancel culture saying that.
You don't want to listen to someone who.
Cares no one's gonna stop you.
The problem is that canceled culture.
Wants them to stop making whatever that.
Is they're making they want the the.
Platform or all these things that's the.
Point of cancer culture saying that oh.
I'm just like i don't want to listen to.
Them anymore.
No that is not how it works your music.
Should be continued to be sold and.
Available.
Personally don't think so just don't.
Listen to don't buy you yourself yeah.
Absolutely every individual has the.
Right to say hey i don't like this and.
You can even tweet about saying no but.
Then to start a boycott that's what yeah.
People are different morally i.
Personally have the right i withhold the.
Right i think all of us do to not go and.
Support these people we don't believe in.
I would never tell you wait i'm gonna go.
See xyz movie and you have to - if you.
Say no you have that right what cancel.
Culture does is saying i'm not gonna see.
This person because i don't like this.
Person is buddy i'll shoot that's why i.
Hate it and smart people i like them.
Like a militant so culture is out of.
Control what the hell is that.
When was this film when it started a.
2090 was a good thing it's like the me -.
Movement a good thing i agree you know.
You had all these victims the police.
Didn't listen what else are you gonna do.
Now that now it's like wait you say you.
Were this and that why didn't you go to.
The police oh they're not gonna listen.
Anyway you should still go to the police.
If it's just easier i was right.
Something when you get the court of.
Public opinion involved i tell you it.
Becomes so horrible i am an artist i've.
Legitimately hit number one on billboard.
People think oh i wish you throw that in.
There this is like i don't run my social.
Media i absolutely do i read comments i.
Respond even negative ones when people.
Say i hope you die somebody should kill.
Your family you should get raped so that.
You you have a baby illegitimate you can.
I mean it is online bullying cancel.
Culture rationally is overall a net.
Positive i think but there are sects of.
Cancel culture like the toxic people.
That issue the death threats then of.
Course those need to be excised cancel.
Culture originated out of compassion the.
Voice for i guess that's the problem no.
One holds the people the people that are.
Part of the hate mob accountable you.
Know i think i think the james charlie.
Singh is such a good example because.
Everyone wants so on board with.
Canceling games and.
Now people are definitely defending.
James to the point where they go after.
Other people for whatever reason i'm.
Just saying that is the thing that.
Happened but wait a minute you were.
First you were ready to cancel him you.
Don't get the right to switch around you.
Know if an influencer did that in turn.
They would be held accountable but for.
The amass group of people that that just.
Doesn't exist so it's like they're.
Expecting everyone else to be better but.
Everyone part of castle culture are no.
Better than self i think so at least.
And speaking of which taught the upload.
Of the video and i wanted to address it.
So badly because i hate her so much.
But i'm just so done with all of this.
It's so childish it feels pity to even.
Comment about like youtube drama and all.
This council stuff that's going on i'm.
Just like i don't want to participate in.
This this is just ridiculous and i don't.
Even care who's right at this point it's.
Like let's say you wanted to boycott.
Coca-cola or nike or something imagine.
If stores started taking nike shoes out.
Of the store before you could even make.
The decision as a people to buy it or.
Not buy it and we need to have the right.
And in the option that our love is i.
Mean technically i'm sure if something.
Really bad came out about a big brand.
They probably wouldn't shelf it right.
Because it looks bad on them so that the.
Argument isn't really bulletproof i'm.
Just playing devil's advocate here for.
The sake of it and also it's almost like.
Youtube is still so new and people have.
Been doing it for so long when the.
Internet was basically the wild west and.
People said and did whatever they did.
Wanted and that's kind of when it's part.
Of the charm of youtube people could.
Express themselves completely freely but.
Now with more advertising and more.
People watching it's clearly slowly.
Developed into a mainstream.
Something more on the ground sub.
Corporate sort of cleanness and that.
Seems to just be the standard for now on.
You know ii from someone that's been.
Through all this cancer time i've.
Definitely become so much more aware of.
Not just what i say but how what i say.
Can be perceived because it's not just.
What you meant.
By communicating something it's it's if.
You can take a portion or what you said.
And it seems like something else that's.
Enough so that's how careful you gotta.
Be when you articulate yourself and yeah.
A lot of times it's not even worth it.
That's why i don't like doing piu news.
Anymore because it's just too much to.
Keep up with and i just and and then i.
Don't i felt done with drama and papa.
Gloria died as well which is so sad.
I know people some people who think oh.
That's so sad he doesn't do it anymore.
And he it's not right but i also feel.
Like i'm too old man.
I don't care this is not why i started.
Youtube and i mean no way expressing.
Myself here so let's keep watching sorry.
For all the rainbows trying to make you.
Not buy the product i think that they're.
Saying as a company we do not agree with.
This so we're not gonna sell your.
Product here when record labels stop.
Playing their music or whatever i feel.
Like it's justified specifically for.
Victims because when it gets out that.
That person did something like that.
Their music skyrockets and for the.
Victim seeing that they're getting so.
Much and then once your cases are over.
Sure you can play their music more if.
They are innocent but it's also like the.
Justice system isn't always right i.
Gotta say people have a very childish.
Sense of justice it's almost like at a.
Childlike level it's probably just me i.
Don't think most people would agree on.
This to me if someone did me bad i.
Wouldn't feel justice just because other.
People found out other people need to.
Know this person is bad because.
Otherwise it's not fair to me i think.
That a lot of people think that way and.
It's a very childish way of looking at.
Things.
Oh this person treated me badly i'm not.
Trying to downplay one no there's.
Obviously many bad things happening and.
There's also things that seem come out.
And seem very trivial you know again.
Referencing that as an example so people.
Don't take what i say out of context the.
Toffee and james situation where tati.
Was mad lizzy tobert was mad that her.
Friend promoted a brand that wasn't hers.
And that was all it took to create the.
Biggest cancel drama in the history of.
Youtube that's basically the mindset of.
This person did something bad to me now.
I need to do so.
Bad for them and other people need to.
Know about it that's what i mean this is.
We're clear just to be clear don't.
Cancel me uh if i have a problem with.
Someone i other stop talking to them or.
I work it out in private but that.
Apparently does not exist because.
Everyone on this website is a mental lea.
Develop underdeveloped child the public.
Should hold celebrities accountable when.
The justice system fails have people not.
Being taught that the world isn't there.
And is never going to be that doesn't.
Mean you should try obviously but it's.
Like it seems so basic i don't get it.
I clearly don't get it this is my take.
On it our kelly is the first name that.
Comes to mind because he has sex tapes.
That show his face and people are still.
Like didn't do it.
We love our kelly he would never and.
Most of the time when it's a celebrity.
Being convicted they can always buy.
Their way out.
That's exactly they came to mind for me.
Too what does she mean buying her weight.
Their way out not getting good lawyers.
Yeah i can see that actually that's what.
Happened with i've seen them isn't it.
It's a fair point how many times in like.
The united states justice system have we.
Seen guilty people get off innocent and.
They find off years later that that.
Happened if such a lot of times it does.
Happen and i think especially it happens.
When you are basing decision around.
Anger and this important sense of.
Justice now it needs to happen now.
Instead of in a court of law where it's.
Carefully examined and impartially.
Examined i think that's important.
Justice system doesn't come through we.
As a people shouldn't that yeah again no.
One's waiting for the justice anymore.
Everyone just found a shortcut that's.
The problem what's important and what's.
Happening now is that we do look at.
Replacing whether it's the district.
Attorney or whatever the system is.
That's causing it to fail people should.
Go and address this so the next millions.
Of people that go through that system go.
Through a justice this room i think we.
All completely agree with that like the.
Justice system needs to be fixed but i.
Do think there.
Reason canceled culture started and when.
It originally derived was because like.
To be 100 like that takes so long like.
For our entire government and justice.
System to like evolve until you're.
Idealistic view of it is not happening.
Next year we're i think we're making.
Change i think it's happening but i.
Think our generation that spawned.
Canceled culture was like you don't have.
Time we have the same problems with kids.
It doesn't matter how it started what.
The problem is what it is now which is.
Ironically the problem with canceled.
Culture because they don't seem to draw.
Any distinction on the past and present.
Apparently i just think if you support.
Him you're a dick.
Right yeah i hate how they're bringing.
Up our kelly yeah everyone can agree on.
That but the problem is so much more.
Nuanced than name but i like.
Compassionate canceller culture if you.
Look at the history of somebody and you.
Look at how somebody responds when.
Confronted they're not discussing any of.
The nuances they're just speaking very.
Broadly you know it's so easy to take.
Clip or a portion of someone said or.
Literally just spread rumors online.
That's enough for people who jump on.
Board and cancel someone these are the.
Issues to me i i think it seems like.
Everyone agrees there should be.
Something happening to bad people yeah.
We can all agree on that there should be.
Some repre caution but it they're not.
Discussing any of the issues that a.
Moles within it we all kind of have the.
Same opinion on a level we think that.
People deserve console myself yes but i.
Feel like we oh my god.
Good talk yeah i appreciate a civil.
Conversation but jesus christ that was.
At least productive thing i've ever seen.
In my life.
Let's see what the comment has to say.
Cuz i'm curious it depends yep cancel.
Culture isn't activism it's virtuous.
Signaling on social media to get clock.
Points on the internet cancel culture.
Works in a way to where people are guilt.
To improve until proven otherwise which.
Is a large reason why it's so toxic.
Sake is this aimed at james.
Charles well yeah i think it must have.
Been uploaded at the same time it's such.
A perfect example but no one learned a.
Single thing and it blows my mind dude.
The same people that are like we need to.
Cancel james charles can you believe.
James charlesworth suicide on we should.
Have canceled culture cards and pass.
Them out you get one alright yet one.
Everyone gets one and then you have to.
Shut the    up that's my solution i.
Think people just have to be brave.
Enough to stand up you know i know i.
Referenced james charles scenario.
Million times already but when i looked.
At that i couldn't make sense of why.
Everyone was canceling james over.
Something so trivial and something.
Allegations that were not proven at that.
Point i think i'm probably more prone to.
Look at things more openly since i've.
Technically been cancelled as well and i.
Hope the public will catch on it seems.
Like in general most people in these.
Comments seems to be against it but the.
Problem is when you get a big group very.
Worked up no one wants to come in.
Between and say no because then they'll.
Jump on you and that's just how it is.
Everyone loves canceled culture until.
You're the one being canceled curious.
About your thoughts on this leave some.
Comments down below maybe we can have a.
Discussion.
Thank you for watching i'm gonna take.
Two days off and see ya tomorrow no two.
Days thanks to all the members i've been.
Really happy that we can do support.
Different charities month thanks to all.
The members and i'm happy to be able to.
Do something positive in these times.
That internet just seems so incredibly.
Heavy when i said as well as the final.
Point whether that i'm careful with what.
I say now because an effective council.
Culture it's not that i'm you know i'm.
Not even scared of being canceled it's.
More the fact that i i just want to.
Enjoy youtube like if people came after.
Me for dumb reasons i know how to defend.
Myself the problem is most people aren't.
Equipped with the tools to deal with the.
Giant hate mob and that's what leads.
People to cancel themselves you know.
People like jenna jenna bob was to quit.
Youtube recently because of the clips.
She did always eight nine eight ten.
Years ago because she's just fed up with.
It which is completely reasonable.
Completely understandable but i hope she.
Comes back iiii think people don't.
Realize this sort of what kind of ball.
Of pain they're inflicting on an.
Individual by doing these things because.
You might think over just getting them.
Canceled or we're just getting them to.
Monetize or whatever but it's so much.
More of an item and whenever there's a.
Big hate mom going at someone you might.
You might not see it but there are.
People doing extreme things like sending.
Death threats daxing go into addresses.
Calling parents calling jobs doing all.
These things that maybe you don't even.
Think about if you think we're just.
Doing this you deserves it there's so.
Much more to it that isn't it just isn't.
Right and it's not appropriate that was.
My final thought for some reason i felt.
Like i hadn't talked enough okay.
Music.
It's time to race what was once.
Forgotten.
What creatures fought spells and poop.
Troops awaits hoopty is coming to.
Nintendo's wait and remember it has a.
Very big tv pre-order promotion i mean a.
Gave me a checkbook particular banjo.
Music.
