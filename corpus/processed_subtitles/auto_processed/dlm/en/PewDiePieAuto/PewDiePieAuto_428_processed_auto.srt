Go go well then good evening everyone my.
Name is gloria borger and welcome to.
Prio news the most reputable respected.
Brand new site that's the sign of the.
Apocalypse oh my god.
Not again i can't do another one god.
Dammit ah the ad pocalypse too is upon.
Us why is everyone talking about this.
Keep watching this video and i will.
Break it down but first a very important.
Admin role will show here oh god it's.
The apocalypse not god what are we gonna.
Do for tonight pulls ads over youtube oh.
God not for tonight nestle pull ads from.
Youtube oh god not nestle the most.
Ethical company of all time tasty dish.
Knee pulls ads from youtube what am i.
Gonna do without disney ads huh ads that.
I'm already not getting on my videos.
With dammit.
This is it this is the end of pew news.
They're just gonna have to buy the.
Mercury that is available on a limited.
Time only i guess that's the only way to.
For this channel to survive another ad.
Pocalypse if everyone buys at least 10.
Pairs then maybe i will survival now i.
Had pocalypse - why are people talking.
About this why are ads pulling away from.
Youtube to understand this very complex.
Situation we need to go back yeah the.
Way i first heard about this was in.
Regards to another channel called girls.
Couture club which we will not show.
There no pictures for those of you don't.
Know girls couture is a youtube channel.
It's kind of like a modeling agency i.
Don't think at least it's just a group.
Of them young girl models now if you.
Check out their channel page the most.
Popular videos are all bikini related so.
Already that's kind of disturbing and at.
The same time as people pointed out that.
This.
Cannell exist to regular family friendly.
I think at least gaming channels got.
Shut down by youtube out of nowhere.
Saying so my channel just went down for.
Community guidelines strikes for sexual.
Content y'all into pokemon or something.
That's right mystic seven who uploads.
Pokemon gold videos got his channel.
Terminate him same thing happened to.
Violence ki bum 94 woke up with my.
Youtube channel terminated great.
Fantastic bielski you upload clubpenguin.
Video so people started wondering why.
Did this happen is it because there has.
Cp in the title cp which of course in.
Pokemon memes combat points but in other.
Terms it could also mean add a file no.
Wait.
Cat porn and then you have club penguin.
Which stands for cp as well as pointed.
Out by emperor lemon youtube vs cp.
Pokemon goat.
No club penguin bikinis ah youtube logic.
Everyone now this doesn't necessarily.
Have anything to do with the ad.
Pocalypse.
But i think it's important for context.
After all now i don't know where this.
Guy name what it is matt what it is made.
A video and he talked about how youtube.
Is facilitating the ad sexual.
Exploitation of children and it's being.
Monetized parentheses 2019 always.
Helpful to know what year it is.
So what matt pointed out was that if you.
Click on videos on youtube a certain.
Type of videos you will eventually enter.
This click hole where youtube will.
Recommend to you videos of really young.
Girls wearing skinny clothes or maybe.
Doing gymnastics or something like that.
The more you click on it the more those.
Videos will be recommended to you and.
I'd be lying if i said i was surprised i.
Mean this is how it works on youtube.
Youtube wants you to stay on the website.
As long as possible so the way the.
Algorithm works is that if you watch a.
Certain type of content for a long time.
Youtube is going to recommend more of.
That content to you now the irony of.
This is that youtube's algorithm has.
Been serving pedophiles videos of young.
Girls i mean it's not funny but it's.
Just messed up another thing matt.
Pointed out was that if you check the.
Comments on these videos there's a bunch.
Of people writing kind stamps now this.
Is a way for people in these pedophile.
Rings to help each other out to find the.
Explicit sexually explicit part or what.
Can be interpreted as such in these.
Videos now these videos in sutton in.
Themselves are just innocent videos of.
Girls they're not doing anything in.
Particular but there might be like that.
One point where maybe they show a little.
Bit more or something like that and.
Through the youtube comment section.
People find those parts more easily.
Models have pointed out how the.
Hypocrisy that these videos are actually.
Monetized as well showing ads on them.
And the apocrypha being that youtube's.
Constantly be monetizing its creators.
While serving ads on this type of.
Content it's kind of annoying but i.
Think there's a bigger issue at hand.
Here which is of course this clickhole.
Of videos now up until this point i'm.
Completely aboard with matt and i agreed.
Like this is just completely disgusting.
Something obviously needs to be done.
About this but somehow this whole thing.
Became let's try and get ads to pull.
Away from youtube and let's try and make.
That happen and then i think what i'm.
Gonna do is i'm going to start.
Contacting mcdonald's and things like.
That if you go to my video youtube is.
Facilitating the sexual exploitation of.
Children in the description i've.
Included all the social media contact.
Information for every brand that appears.
In my video and will i it worked.
Advertisers started pulling out from.
Youtube because of this now a lot of.
People asked why is pulling ads from.
Youtube stopping pedophiles well.
Obviously it doesn't it might raise more.
Awareness or urgency to youtube but.
Other than that it just seems like.
You're just gonna hurt everyone on the.
Website it's there is it the right way.
To go about it now a side effect of this.
Became that not just advertisers pulled.
Up courts but channels that uploaded.
Family-friendly content with their kids.
In it got their videos to monetize.
Jessica balling ever who pointed out.
That the videos of her five-year-old son.
Got the monetized.
And not just the monetized but she all.
The comments on these videos were.
Disabled as well youtube responded to.
This saying that out of abundance of.
Caution some videos that include minors.
And.
At risk of predatory comments may have.
Comments disabled this is only related.
To content that may invade your minors.
More info they also recommended that if.
You have videos with minors in them you.
Should hold off comments and review.
Which honestly seems pretty sensible if.
You ask me youtube also said that they.
Terminated 400 channels and reported.
Illegal comments to the law enforcement.
Which is great but people were furious.
People were genuinely outraged saying.
This is the end of youtube because of.
This response that youtube made with.
Regards to the action that we've taken.
Even if your video is suitable for.
Advertisers inappropriate comments could.
Result in your video receiving limited.
Or no act so comments on youtube could d.
Monetize for the creator which seems.
Pretty crazy if you think about it and a.
Lot of people who are not happy about.
This saying youtube is now officially.
The monetizing videos in the comments.
Section how easy it is now to rekha.
Youtube verse career just leave insults.
On their videos and they get punished.
For it and a lot of people echoed this.
Sentiment basically going well so what.
You're saying is that if i'm powerful.
Enough troll i could single-handedly.
Destroy someone's livelihood and you.
Don't see anything wrong with that i.
Think for the first time in a long time.
I'm on the side well youtube this is.
Obviously a swift and short-term.
Solution because people like matt who.
Just want to see the site burn and are.
Contacted advertisers and doing all this.
Stuff to to just cause as much damage.
And havoc as possible they obviously.
Need to act quickly the videos that got.
Demonetized from jessica are gymnastic.
Videos of a five year old i'm sorry but.
Maybe you can live without them being.
Monetized it seems kind of questionable.
Already even if they are advertiser.
Friendly given the circumstance.
Obviously they could be problematic i.
Think i have the right to talk about.
This because pretty much exact same.
Thing happened to me there's in a.
Different context of me making jokes.
Okay it's not the exact same thing but.
Basically i made jokes about jews and.
Then you had actual aunt who sent my.
Taking it seriously and that caused a.
Bunch of problems for me and.
It's kind of similar in a really weird.
Way it's annoying how minority of.
Disgusting idiots are causing so much.
Problem but that's the reality of the.
Situation i think there's a larger issue.
At hand here where it goes back to the.
Beginning with the girls couture stuff.
Where you have girls in bikinis very.
Young what do you do with that are you.
Gonna allow that to be monetized from.
Now on and where do you draw the line on.
That it's family-friendly no longer.
Family-friendly hmm they're not setting.
A precedent by removing comments or de.
Monetizing these videos it's not.
Something that's gonna affect everyone.
On the site it's clearly something.
They've done just to act swiftly at a.
Time when it's necessary and to be.
Honest i appreciate that youtube does.
That so before everyone freaks out and.
See youtube is over no it isn't calm.
Down they are working on and i trust.
That they are actually now something.
Worth actually getting outraged about.
The sub gap pewdiepie versus t series.
Now obviously i'm completely impartial.
In this matter i don't care who wins or.
Comes down on top t gay.
T gay but last night the sub gap closed.
Now of course viewer discretion is.
Advised what i'm about to show you is.
Extremely disturbing that's right these.
Series you thought you had me the job.
Youtube those slides son of a guns.
Decided to delete 20,000 subscribers.
Immediately from my channel the sub gap.
Was at 22,000 and then very quickly they.
Took over t series actually past.
Pewdiepie in subscribers for 10 minutes.
Ten excruciating painful minutes but it.
Was necessary because now they got a.
Taste of what it means to be number one.
And that's all you're ever gonna get tv.
Series they meant nothing because you.
Know what happened.
Even must came down from the sky and.
Hosted me review and now the sub gap is.
At 55,000 and pewdiepie is rightfully at.
Number one again i'm not supposed to.
Give my opinion on that of course but he.
Deserves it goddamnit.
