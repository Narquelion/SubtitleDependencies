Ah today is a beautiful day because.
Today we're looking at.
Tlc 90 day fiance i don't know how they.
Do it but they always find the most.
Insane couples of all time and i love it.
I'm not afraid.
To say it i love it i i love it.
And today we're looking at chantel.
And pedro does that not look like me a.
Little bit what the.
The problem with these is that they're.
Scattered all right here we go pedro age.
Chantal 20s wait a minute i know this oh.
God i've seen.
How they met yeah yeah yeah they learn.
They learn spanish together.
Over the app like those apps where you.
Teach each other the language.
They met and they fall in love chantal.
Went to dominican republic.
And then they oh why do i know this.
This is so sad this is what i've been.
Filling my brain with.
Anyway let's watch i actually have no.
Idea what happened after that so this.
Should be interesting what.
What has happened between pedro and.
Chadel.
That's how you say their names in.
Dominican republican no whatever.
Everything's right okay that's smooth.
See those uh spanish-speaking countries.
They are smooth.
Don't worry baby everything is okay okay.
Don't worry baby everything is gonna be.
Okay doesn't even speak the language but.
He knows how to sweesel in there.
I'm really confused about my marriage.
Right now uh-huh.
Why confronted pedro about what he said.
Last night at the winery.
And how he's planning to go back to the.
Dr he's going back to the dr.
Oh the dominican republic i thought she.
Meant doctor.
That you had serious plans to go back to.
Your country and we haven't even spoke.
About this.
Yeah i think what's fun about these.
Is figuring out who's the villain right.
There's always.
Either it's the foreigner or it's the.
Local one.
I'm saying localized america is local to.
Me but the.
Medicare republic is probably closer but.
That's the fun is it pedro.
Yeah don't worry baby everything is.
Gonna be okay i'm not going to leave in.
There.
She gone there for a couple of a couple.
Of weeks maybe.
One two weeks he doesn't want to go back.
To dr maybe he should eat an apple.
Because it keeps the dr away.
That's fine i don't need that to some.
Degree.
But i still feel like i don't know what.
Pedro's.
True intentions are for our future i.
Think.
Pedro wanted a little better what's.
Covering half your body jesus christ.
And he was done anyone leaving you here.
You gotta stay.
Good morning pedro chantel ago money.
Whoa what the hell how did you sleep did.
You sleep well last night uh.
The way he speaks is beautiful and he.
Reminds me when i try to talk to.
Marcia's parents.
Hey ciao.
Pedro we definitely want to talk to you.
About what was said yesterday.
Ah god i know what it is oh my god.
He sounds like the guy from the room.
Thomas please.
I don't want to talk last night you know.
It's america when they have.
Juices this in size pedro mentioned that.
He would be.
Going back to the island so that's the.
Mom.
And that he would not be taking chantel.
With him.
Desperate to find out what actually is.
Going on with people what happened.
In the dr we could find something.
Extremely sinister.
We were definitely on the impression.
That you were going to go to school.
Once chantelle finishes school he was.
Gonna go back to school.
Oh i remember now i remember now.
Okay i can get backstory this is the.
Problem because on the internet they.
Don't upload the whole.
Context but i remember so i can explain.

She lied right she said he was just.
Gonna come over.
To stay for a little while like two.
Weeks but she didn't mention that they.
Already got married.
Ah and also this guy's demeanor legend.
I would love to be this guy we were.
Definitely on the impression that you.

Impression that uh.

Passive aggressive i love it.

Dilemma hey.

Central family.

This feels like watching like a very.
Poorly acted soap opera and i.
Love it i absolutely love it.
Land organized marriage ring.
Type of business.
On this well this is organized marriage.
I saw your mother's website.
Oh advertising for dominican.
Women that wanted to get married.
American ah oh look at    that's nice.
What i know that pedro's her mother's.
Website is.
A lawyer but i believe.
Lydia is a business to find.
Stupid americans.
Did she just call her daughter a stupid.
You dumb on live television well god.
Bless.
Parents to match with.
A person on the island to harvest the.
American dollar.
And i have a feeling shentel was.
Introduced to pedro.
For that same reason but they met over.
The app.
Mom they met over the app this doesn't.
Add up.
Chantel mom talks so slow like damn i.
Feel like fishing sets enough for her.
Pedro's actions when his family comes.
Around all right.
Pedo fights with chantel's brother fight.
Yes i'd like to get to the bottom of.
This.
I would like to know what nicole's.
Motives are.
Oh my god she's right now i can't get.
Past it she speaks so freaking slow.
Hey yeah yeah yeah.
Applause.
Whoa he slept the lap that's an ikea.
Life don't ever slept by klm.
Oh    oh oh oh.
Applause.

Control because he slapped that keel.
Lamp but.

Laugh.
In front of me god damn.
Family family dinners right they're.
Crazy sheesh.
Oh the producer has to come to bed.
Healthy relationship am i right go get.
Married abroad with someone you don't.

Yeah what could go wrong i did that.
Never mind uh.
All right here we come apology.
That's a that's a good apology all right.
Yo whatever it says.
I'm sorry okay you want an apology.
I'm    sorry okay oh thank you so.
Much thank you for the apology.
Yes.
Music.
Oh is it are they here for the wedding.
And they're already fighting so much.
She could have a better guy than pedro.
All right okay i guess pedro is the.
Villain.
Pedro has an extremely strong bond with.
His mother.
He's a mama's boy but i think another.
Good reason to not marry someone.
Because you marry someone that's a.
Moment boy you're not just marrying one.
Person.
And we've seen that over and over on.
This show that's a package.
Deal right there he shares a little too.
Much with his family and he should keep.
Our private business.
Private.
So.
Music.
Is.
Wow speaking really fast i don't really.
Understand.
It's almost like she doesn't even care i.
Understood all of that.
I mean there were subtitles but still.
Come on stupid americano.
What what is she saying i don't.
Understand.
Wow i cannot deal with pedro's mom's.
Negativity right now.
Yeah what the hell i basically found out.
That our whole marriage.
Is a scam why i knew it i saw it.
I knew it ever since i drank that apple.
Juice.
Plot to use another person.
It's almost borderline body trafficking.
Yes is it is it yeah.
Pedro has crossed the.
Line i think as a parent pedro.
Has gone one step.
Two chances mom was made for reality tv.
You're right.
Holy    step in to try to talk to.
Pedro to try to handle the situation we.
Should just go over there we need to.
Know that.
You should talk to pedro don't go to my.
House i am going to do something.
Stay away from my house oh    they're.
Going to go to their house.
They're going to go to pedro i shouldn't.
Have told you anything this is.
My relationship yeah right i mean why is.
Their family so involved that's just a.
Recipe for disaster because everyone's.
Gonna have a different opinion.
And at the end of the day you need to.
Make your own it's your relationship.
Not your family's relationship but it.
Seems like on both sides it's so deeply.
Connected.
There was a big fight if my family goes.
To see pedro right now.
It's only going to make things a million.
Times yep.
Yes.
She did not just do that i was not ready.
For that motherfucker's a taser.
She's gonna taste her husband oh.
Oh yeah let's go let's go champ.
No don't go mom don't chase him don't do.
It.
Oh my god holy    i was not expecting.
That.
I am going to meeting with immigration.
Lawyer all right how are you doing.
Yeah good my mom and my sister.
To living in the united states for the.
State over here with me.
I don't think that that's not how it.
Works yeah it's not everywhere that's.
Not going to work dude i live here i'm.
Gonna leave over here.
Okay you need to be a u.s citizen before.
You can sponsor them.
Oh okay okay so there's a chance all.
Right they don't get citizenship.
As soon as you get married right you.
Just get a visa to stay.
And then after a couple of years right.
You can apply for citizenship i think.
That's how it works he's got.
Two years before he's a citizen uh i was.
Right mother's process will probably.
Take about a year and a half.
But there is an exception if you're.
Married to a u.s citizen.
Then you are eligible right away in.
Order to.
Fall under that exception you have to.
Show that you're still married that.
You're living together.
You're providing additional evidence of.
The relationship.
And then you could have an interview.
Together.
With you and your wife.
Yeah what's wrong with that a little bit.
Scared see somebody coming for the.
Interview.
And then my wife you want to go with me.
Well why wouldn't she.
Laughter.
But the requirement is that she would.
Need to attend yeah that's.
That's some pretty basic    there.
Pedro do you feel like that my mother my.
Sister.
Never treat chantel well.
And then maybe so maybe you should stand.
Up for your wife.
Say this is the woman i married and i.
Love her so you have to respect her if.
You respect me.
Well now i know the real reason he got.
Married oh.
You know something i want to be my.
Father.
Enjoy my brother but it's not going to.
Be like this.
Because you hit ikea lamp i can't.
Forgive.
This he is not my family pedro.
Doesn't have a father in his life and he.
Doesn't have a brother.
I would like to let him know that hey.
This is a good family setting.
That he needs to be a part of oh that's.
Nice.
Thomas i don't think the guy's trip is.
Gonna help you out.
You have a young man who is using your.
Daughter.
Just straight up using her oh.
People that lie.
Consistently are liars.
And they cannot be trusted they can be.
Trusted to lie.
Damn that all right.
Here we go peter and gentle mommy pedo.
Enchanters families face off.
The final battle avengers end game it.
All.
Comes down to this.
Oh    oh    i have no.
Idea what these people are saying but.
I noticed that he's gonna have to fight.
Oh my god what a mess dad can't tell.
I'm leaving trying to save that marriage.
Yeah i gotta see the taser scene.
Okay here we go taste him.
Out he knows she's got the taser.
I don't want to tell you oh she's got.
Murdering rights.

The dominican republic.
And the respect for our daughter.
Chantelle told us what happened oh she.
She's got the.
What on the island yeah what is that.
What is that.
Oh they're crazy it's a flashlight a.
Tactical one.

God that's got to be exhausting wait.
Where are they calling her black.
Karen jesus first time i see a black.

Do they deal with it.
Geez maybe marrying someone abroad isn't.
A good idea after all guys.
Jesus christ well well well.
That's another tlc apparently pedro.
And chantal is still together so maybe.
Maybe all ends well ends well or.
Whatever the saying is.
