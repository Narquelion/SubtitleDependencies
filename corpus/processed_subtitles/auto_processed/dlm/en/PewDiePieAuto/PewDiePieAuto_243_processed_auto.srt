Why am i so cold first we peel the.
Potatoes.
Okay we should probably boil the water.
I'll do that now just in case you're.
Following the recipe you.
Uh you boil the water if you don't know.
How to boil water i got bad news for you.
Neither do i help me i remember in a.
Cooking class in sweden for some reason.
Our.
Cooking teacher was very weird about the.
Right amount of water for the potatoes.
Because if you use too much you lose.
Some of the nutrition but obviously.
And you're not supposed to put the.
Potatoes i'm sure someone's gonna say.
I'm wrong.
But i don't care all right in case my.
Home school teacher is watching you're.
Supposed to.
Put the potatoes after the potato boils.
Okay.
Yeah but then if you can't use too much.
Water.
And the water evaporates you don't know.
How much water you're supposed to get.
And i remember when we did the test me.
And my friend.
The moment we realized that we nailed.
The amount of water we were like.
Yeah yeah we got the right amount of.
Water for the potatoes.
Like that matters at all for the cooking.
That's a fun story from childhood yes.
Don't forget to salt the water.
I don't know how much to put while the.
Water.
Boil up we peel potato okay make sure.
You wash your potatoes.
Like a caressing a newborn child that's.
How you want to do it.
And then this is crazy you peel the.
Potato.
I noticed putting like a paper towel.
Underneath is such a good life hack.
Usually in sweden we just peel the.
Potatoes in the sink and then we clean.
It oh i missed cutting.
And this is gross you do this and once.
You peel bing bang boom.
It's epic okay side epic.
Time lapse of me peeling potato.
The potatoes are peeled yeah don't have.
To touch.
Anything god damn i keep dropping now.
Actually i think.
I almost forgot since we were gonna make.
Them into mash.
Anyway you can just cut them so they.
Boil quicker.
Yeah jacksepticeye is crying right now.
Fun fact potatoes is the only.
Invention out of ireland congrats.

A b separator.
