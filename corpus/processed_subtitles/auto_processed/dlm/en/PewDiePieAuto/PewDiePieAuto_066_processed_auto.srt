I can for you guys it was once a mask.
Who lived under a yard or a barn one day.
He saw frigerator was empty so he.
Descended to himself to go out and hunt.
He went to the henhouse and took an egg.
It doesn't look like he took an egg it.
Looks like he freaking shot an egg with.
A bazooka just like worms he boiled the.
Egg okay.
What the breakfast he said then during.
Dinner he was hungry so he went through.
The forest and haunted then he saw a fox.
And then he ate fox for dinner he ate.
The fox hears him shooting the fox.
I remember thinking it was so funny to.
Make the ice pop out like i did here in.
This picture.
Comical genius i was on to something i.
Knew it i'm into this story it's really.
Good later after dinner he was hungry.
Again so he ate and mousse and he was so.
Full that he exploded then the chicken.
Jumped out of bailey from the worm bing.
Bang bong bing bang bang bong my god.
Where's this going and then the chicken.
Ate the worm and then fox came out of.
Nowhere then the fox came and ate the.
Chicken and then mousse made the fox and.
All that was left was that for moose the.
