Music.
Let's finally review plato there.
Republic why am i doing this how did i.
Go from ukraine it's cringe for you me.
To even bring it up but like i used to.
Scream at horror games anyway i'm new to.
Philosophy and i have always been told.
That i should always start with the.
Greeks and no thank you i always say i.
Would rather read there.
But finally i picked up plato's.
Symposium because it was fairly short.
And i thought why not but i was very.
Happily surprised it was very good it.
Felt like looking through a window of.
Time where you joined the dinner table.
Of ancient greek philosophers discussing.
Through the night there are thoughts on.
Eros their desires and it was very nice.
So naturally led me to read one to read.
The republic which is arguably plato's.
Greatest work if not one of the greatest.
Political western philosophies of all.
Time what a title everyone and again i.
Was very happily surprised how much i.
Enjoyed it for those who don't know it's.
A it's a dialectic it's a dialogue.
Between two people or a couple people.
With different views and somehow coming.
To some form of conclusion and i find.
This style of writing to be so much more.
Engaging and immersing seem like i.
Described with the symposium plato's.
Writing is about coming to a conclusion.
Together and plato himself.
Self-admittedly doesn't have all the.
Answers that's why i picked this book.
Because i think it could be interesting.
To discuss because of all of these.
Things that i just said how do i make.
Videos sorry this will be a very long.
Video but that's strap on and put on.
Your vlog seatbelts and let's freakin do.
This please keep watching i need the.
Watch time just put put on the video in.
The background i don't care just keep we.
Have some couple important notes before.
We begin plato the republic is a very.
Controversial piece of literature it.
Challenges fundamental ideas not just.
Around society but also how we review.
Our own lives in ways that might feel a.
Bit uncomfortable it probably should.
Make you feel uncomfortable and i think.
That's a lot of times the point as a way.
To challenge ideas i don't know if.
That's true or not i just threw that in.
There but most importantly i just want.
To say here early on big disclaimer i do.
Not agree with every single idea that.
19.
Disclosure everyone.
I think most people wouldn't agree with.
All the ideas of plato and plato himself.
Doesn't agree with all his ideas so we.
Get later on he'll disc criticize his.
Own thoughts basically i am not an.
Expert i am not pretending that i know.
Everything about this i will just give.
My own summary and thoughts around the.
Different topics discussed and i highly.
Encourage you to do your own study and.
Research to fully get that proper grasp.
Of this book this is going great.
First of all i think it's important to.
Understand why this book was written to.
Fully understand where the ideas came.
From to properly critique something you.
You need more than just the ideas you.
Need to understand where the ideas come.
From and a lot of the more crazy ideas.
Of plato that a republic will make a lot.
More sense with these things in mind i.
Think at least so some quick background.
Basically plato lived in 428 did i get.
That right that's right.
428 bc in athens greek in greece greece.
Athens and the ancient greek as i'm sure.
A lot of you are already familiar with.
Defined a lot of our western.
Civilization babe had massive leaps in.
Not just philosophy but our literature.
Biology architecture politics and much.
Much more.
All this while simultaneously fighting.
Two wars the persian war and the.
Peloponnesian war this has relevance we.
Will get there i promise just keep the.
Video going in the background so during.
The persian war where the greeks were.
Vastly outnumbered i always imagined.
Like the movie 300 even though that's.
Clearly not what happened at all but the.
Greeks were vastly outnumbered but the.
Way they defeat the persians was from.
Coming together all the different.
City-states of greece came together.
Ancient greece back then was.
Very different from how we know brief is.
It greek or greece it's really annoying.
Me how i don't know this it was very.
Different from what it is today it's.
Been north and i think even across italy.
All these different areas i don't know.
Exactly the their geographics okay but.
It was bigger okay and the old estates.
Came together and just be like no persia.
Go away and they did it but after this.
Word after defeating the persians.
Instead of all the states coming.
Together they broke apart and they.
Fought against each other in a civil war.
Known as the peloponnesian war where.
They fought against who should be the.
Ruler of the city-states it was a very.
It was a very brutal war which you can.
Tell just from how long it lasted 27.
Years and eventually athens lost play to.
Live who lived during this time he saw.
The effects of this war he people close.
To him that passed away and i think and.
I think keeping this in mind is.
Important for some of the more crazy.
Ideas that are proposed in the republic.
Because plato wanted to avoid civil war.
At all cost and i think keeping that in.
Mind is important to have an open eye.
Open mind for the discussion.
The second reason i think is because.
Athens at this time was a democracy and.
That was something that the athenians.
Were very proud of it's something that.
Was part of their character that they.
Had that they lived in a democracy and.
It was something that they greatly.
Upheld but in 399 bc 399 so cortez i'll.
Never forget that number so curtis the.
Philosopher was executed under this.
Democracy and i think this is something.
That really affected plato and also.
Shaped ideas for the republic so the.
Peloponnesian war and the fact that.
Socrates was executed i don't know if.
This is correct.
I'm just saying okay so then what was.
Plato's and socrates relationship we.
Haven't even started with the book.
Review yet felix.
This is just an essay at this point i.
Just think it's necessary to establish.
Early on why their relationship i didn't.
Really know it i mean i think most.
People have heard of so curtis.
Maybe not of plato or vice versa i don't.
Know but so cthis was a philosopher he.
Is a historical figure that that did.
Exist the thing is that he never wrote.
Down any of his work and it was plato.
Who basically did this but plato writes.
His work in the republic as a dialogue.
Where socrates is the main character and.
Obviously we can't know for sure to what.
Level of accuracy the dialogue actually.
Occurred most likely it wasn't that.
Accurate but again we don't know but it.
Is a little bit confusing because plato.
Is the author and but socrates is the.
Main character who presents all these.
Ideas some compare socrates and played.
This relationship as a sort of.
Teacher-student relationship which is.
Inaccurate because so kurt has never.
Taught he'd spoken people listened but.
It also kind of fits the picture as well.
I like to see it as a senpai and kohai.
Kind of relationship so then what is the.
Republic about you might ask how long.
Have i recorded oh god.
Well socrates is famously not interested.
In finding relative solutions he wants.
To find absolute truths if we don't know.
What something is then how can we.
Properly understand it and so curtis is.
Famous for trapping his opponents with.
His what is it question to give it give.
A definition of something and the.
Republic begins with such a question.
Such a what is it question in brooke one.
The novel begins with socrates he is.
Walking home from a religious festival.
And he stumbles into some acquaintances.
Who convinced him to come over to their.
Place he sort of half reluctantly.
Accepts there's a couple of people in.
This group but let's focus on cephalus.
First syphilis is an older man and the.
Dialogue begins with this what is it.
Question coming from a soccer test who.
As cephalus what's it like to be so old.
This could be seen as a very rude.
Question to ask someone but socrates.
Once to spark a conversation not about.
Making people feel good.
Despite the very rude question cephalus.
Responds in a composed manner of saying.
That well i enjoy being old i no longer.
Feel controlled by arrows my desires.
Doesn't control him anymore he looked.
Forward to being rewarded in his next.
Life because he's lived an honest life.
And lived up to his legal dues so he.
Thinks well i may be old i may be dying.
Soon but i still will be rewarded in the.
Next life and socrates goes godom you.
Just gave me a definition of justice.
Living in an honest life and living up.
To your legal dues that's the definition.
Of justice that you just gave me even.
Though that's not my question.
And then to stomp over settle his.
Argument that he never even.
Intentionally made socrates challenges.
Cephalus view england further and says.
Well if justice is living up to your.
Legal dues then let's say for example i.
Don't know if this is not the example he.
Brings but let's say you borrow an axe.
From a friend because you need to chop.
Some wood and then later on your friend.
Demands to have the axe back but the.
Friend has gone completely insane.
Would you still give the axe back to him.
Obviously not you you wouldn't give a.
Weapon to a crazy person so in that's.
Regard no justice is not living up to.
Your legal obligations and you are just.
Wrong in this argument that you never.
Even made cephalus who's old is not.
Interested in this conversation and he.
Bids his farewell and leaves the group.
But there are some younger remaining.
People in the group who has been.
Listening and they give their opinion on.
Instead one of them being chris amicus.
Who is a sawfish sophists were teachers.
I think back in ancient greek where they.
Would be hired by rich people to teach.
Their sons they are the enemy of plato.
And socrates you can say because they.
Are not interested in finding absolute.
Truth and they're just more interested.
In winning an argument basically and go.
Into whatever stretched to do so.
So there's images this office says gives.
His definition of justice and says.
Justice is the advantage of the stronger.
He admits that this is not really a.
Definition but he's saying that it pays.
Off more to be unjust than to be just.
And people who are are unjust naturally.
Progress in society and justice is a.
Restraint put on us stopping our natural.
Desires to progress socrates then.
Responds by saying well if justice is in.
The advantage of the stronger do people.
Make mistakes and through simcha says.
Yes people make mistakes and then.
Socrates asked well-to-do rulers make.
Mistakes and of course recent mexico.
Says yes rulers can make mistakes and.
Then he finishes by saying well i don't.
Remember if this is the exact example.
But let's say for example if you are a.
Ruler and you put up a tax policy that.
Will benefit you you will get more money.
From the people and you'll raise the.
Taxes but the ruler is doing what they.
Think is just because they have the.
Advantage and they gain from this but.
Let's say then that this new tax policy.
Basically bleeds the city dry there's no.
More money left and eventually it will.
End up hurting the ruler because he's.
Left with less than what he had from the.
Beginning and you know.
Longer acquire anything from its.
Citizens therefore justice is not in.
Fact in the advantage of the stronger.
Because rulers makes mistakes through.
Simic has response then by saying well i.
Need to win this argument justice is.
What the ruler thinks is in the.
Advantage of the stronger and very.
Interestingly their simba cos sort of.
Just disappears from the book at this.
Point he could very well still be part.
Of the group and listening silently but.
It's not worthy how he disappears at.
This point because he brings up the.
Subject he brings up the the relative.
Argument and so curtis just isn't.
Interesting interested in it that's not.
The reason of this dialogue he wants to.
Find the ultimate troop of what is.
Justice socrates has now defeated his.
Opponents more or less but the rest of.
The group is not entirely satisfied.
Golovkin who is another member of the.
Party wants a better definition of.
Justice is just life superior to an.
Unjust life it's a question that they.
Ask and they want socrates to prove it.
And maybe you were thinking while.
Finding the definition of justice that's.
Really not that interesting at least.
First when i heard about it i wasn't.
Completely engaged but when you think.
About it and a broad broad sense it it.
Really shapes everything in our lives.
What is good and what is bad what is.
Right and wrong is being it's being just.
Better than being unjust why should you.
Live an unjust life instead of an unjust.
Life i think it's a very interesting.
Topic that i've never asked myself.
Before and gakuen brings up a very.
Interesting example.
Kokom says that justice is social bond a.
Contract between people which i think.
Can make sense he expressed as much like.
Her simic has said that we have a.
Natural desire to wanting to gain more.
And the only reason we don't act unjust.
Is because we don't want unjust things.
Happened to ourselves and if the whole.
World acted unjust then everyone would.
Just stand to lose from it so therefore.
It's a social contract his view of.
Justice so therefore in his view justice.
Comes from weakness and it comes from.
Fear and he brings up this example of.
The ring of guy g's which is a magical.
Ring so he brings up this thought.
Example of if you had a ring that could.
Render you invisible.
Would you still act just i think i've.
Played around with this idea and maybe.
You have as well where if you had.
Something where if you could do.
Something unjust and no one would know.
About it.
Would you do it and glaucon argues that.
Anyone with this ring even the most just.
Person would still act unjust because if.
You're invisible no one will know about.
It you could rot rob a bank or you could.
I don't know and do all kinds of things.
I'm not gonna bring up their example.
Whenever people ask me what my.
Superpower ability would be i always.
Thought okay well what superpower could.
I get that would benefit me the most and.
Not face any consequences so i think.
This definition fits in pretty well and.
I think it fits in with actually what a.
Lot of people look at justice it's a.
Pretty i think a common common way to.
Look at it but we may maybe we've never.
Actually thought about it.
Edda man just join us into the.
Conversation as well with who is.
Glaucon's brother i think and he says.
That justice itself isn't desirable and.
That we only act just because we want to.
Be rewarded in the afterlife.
So therefore element is in vulcan want.
Socrates to prove to them that justice.
In itself is desirable and that living a.
Just life is better than living in a.
Unjust life and socrates warns adam.
Enticing glaucon that this is gonna be a.
Very long journey to get through and i.
Will warn you in case you made it this.
Far in this video that yes in fact it.
Will be very long video but they are up.
For the task they're young and they're.
Excited and they.
They want to find the answer i also.
Think it's interesting how socrates.
Purposely wanted to hear everyone else's.
Argument at this point he hasn't really.
Expressed his own views he's literally.
He's actually just picked apart what.
Other people's ideas are but this is.
Really where the book begins all of its.
Own topic to find the definition of.
Justice and the way plato or socrates.
Does this i think it's very surprising.
And very interesting to prove that.
Justice is superior he brings up the.
Analogy of the human in a macro.
Perspective of a city it's called the.
City sol analogy and basically it means.
That to prove that a just city is.
Happier than an unjust city the same.
Analogy can be drawn between a just man.
And an unjust man what a just man is.
Happier than an unjust person and so.
Begins the very long journey of the.
Republic i will brush through some.
Points just to save time and i also.
Still don't understand all of it to be.
Honest i guess i'm just too old.
So to craft this society so curtis says.
That each person in this city must.
Specialized to maximize the efficiency.
Of the city he wants a shoemaker to.
Focus solely on making shoes a doctor to.
Solely focus on.
Doing doctor things and that a shoemaker.
Who specializes will always be better.
Than a shoemaker that doesn't specialize.
And the shoemaker will always be better.
At making shoes then a doctor can make.
Shoes and a doctor will always be a.
Better doctor than a shoemaker ok i.
Think you understand what i mean so this.
City will initially just start off with.
Farmers craftsmen doctors the city will.
Live with just what is necessary and and.
Won't go beyond that and socrates calls.
That this city is healthy because of.
This but how come however has a very.
Different view on it he says that this.
Is he calls it a city of pigs ironically.
He thinks that people have a natural.
Desire for more people have a natural.
Desire for luxury better entertainment.
Better food so he argues that they will.
Want to eat meat in this city which is a.
Seemingly small distinction from what.
The city previously has been but it.
Makes all the difference because to have.
Meat in the city you need more land and.
To have more land you need to go to war.
And therefore they both agree that this.
Is a natural progression glaucon and.
Socrates agrees this is a natural.
Progression and that war is inevitable.
In this city and therefore a new class.
Of people is introduced in the republic.
Which is the warriors by socrates idea.
Of specialization warriors can only be.
Warriors and nothing else and he.
Describes his highly spirited individual.
And these highly spirited individuals.
Make for great warriors but they are.
Hard to control you want to be able to.
Control them so they don't become thugs.
And break the laws but you also don't.
Want them to become too wimpy as well so.
Socrates proposes that the best way to.
Contain these warriors is through.
Education so it's important that these.
Warriors are educated to act on the will.
Of the city how do we do that well so.
Curtis explains what stories will be.
Available in this city and what stories.
Won't be available i think more.
Importantly he says that the classic.
Legends of homer will be forbidden or.
Send.
Third in the city because the stories in.
Homer and other works show that dying as.
Something really bad and that's not.
Beneficial for the city warriors needs.
To be able to die for their state and.
Therefore they cannot allow that these.
Work of fiction to be shaping the souls.
Of the warriors so christine goes.
Through in great detail what will be.
Allowed not just in literature but also.
Music what kind of instrument and even.
What type of notes will be allowed or at.
Least what will be the most effective.
You can look at it the same way of the.
Type of music that is played in in.
Military it's very similar with the.
Drums and then the type of tunes but.
This all falls under a very interesting.
Topic of censorship it's something that.
We've all been affected by ever since.
Growing up our parents censor certain.
Things from us when we are children and.
They do this for a good cause they do it.
To protect us and i would argue that so.
Curtis sees the city and its people in.
The same way where the city would be a.
Mother censoring certain things for.
Their child censorship is a topic that.
Is still widely discussed even today i.
Think there's three points that can be.
Brought up against censorship i mean iii.
Myself has been highly affected by it i.
Would would even say i think the number.
One point against censorship is that.
There's a natural curiosity towards.
Things that aren't allowed i think most.
People can relate to wanting to do.
Something more because they weren't.
Allowed to do it and and the desire to.
Wanted to do it eve being even stronger.
Because of it another example could be.
If a parent for example lies to their.
Child let's say a parent a mother might.
Be a such a bad example if a mother is a.
Stripper and maybe they don't want their.
Child to go through go through the same.
Career path then they might lie about.
What their job is before they go to work.
It.
They might say i'm going to i don't know.
The bank instead to protect their child.
They do this to protect their child.
Because they don't want them to follow.
The same path but eventually let's say a.
Couple of years down the line the child.
Finds out the truth and this sort of.
Trust between a mother and a child has.
Been broken because of their censorship.
And maybe the damage would have been the.
Damage of that is much more than what.
Would have been if the parent had just.
Said the truth a lot of times you could.
Argue it's the negative effect of what's.
Being censored really more than what is.
Positive just video games really cause.
Violence and i think by censorship you.
Are in playing that you know better you.
Know for a fact that this needs to be.
Censored because i know it has a.
Negative effect and i think that's a lot.
Of times is said without much evidence i.
Think it's a really interesting topic.
Some people are arguing that censorship.
Is good some people arguing that it's.
Always bad and here we are.
2000 year later still discussing it.
There's also many examples of in history.
Of progression of humanity being held.
Back because of censorship.
We had galileo a famous example must be.
Getting tired at this point whose.
Famously his ideas were censored because.
He challenged the christian view what's.
Your right what's your opinion of.
Censorship are you still with me hello.
The next topic of the republic is.
Another controversial idea in this city.
That socrates describes there will be.
Doctors of course but these doctors will.
Not treat anyone if you get wounded in.
Battle of course the doctor will treat.
You but any form of self-inflicted.
Injury.
Will not be taken care of let's say if.
You injure yourself from eating or.
Drinking too much as an example sorry.
That time and resources will not be.
Wasted on you which kind of makes sense.
A little bit but then it gets a little.
Darker so curtis would probably argue.
For a euthanasia if you have a chronic.
Illness you are then just costing this.
City a bunch of money and resources and.
Therefore you will be thanked for your.
Service in the city but you will also be.
Pissed.
I think obviously now we have a very.
Different view of life and i'm not.
Saying i agree with it we obviously we.
Know a lot more than we did back then we.
Don't have the same view of the.
Afterlife as well but i think what's.
Interesting here is the distinction.
Between a good and a bad like a.
Fundamental belief from when we're.
Grown-up is that everyone is born equal.
And we have the same should be we should.
All be treated equally and i agree with.
That of course but i think we're i think.
It's interesting is if the distinction.
Between a good and a bad life and i.
Think we treat all life as good when.
That's not necessarily the case i hope.
That isn't taken in a weird way by.
Anyone all right let's move on this is.
Too controversial.
The third controversial idea three in a.
Row is the the myth of metals which is.
Another idea proposed by socrates and he.
Explains this in the almost embarrassed.
Manner he knows how ridiculous this.
Sounds is metal metals but basically.
It's a lie told by the city to its.
Citizens that they don't have any mother.
Or father and that they came from the.
Earth that's right and i i think the.
Purpose of this is pretty obvious it's.
So that you would look at this state as.
Your parent and socrates finds is very.
Useful for the sake of.
Hey patriotic view of the state and and.
Loyalty to the state and there's similar.
Ideas around housing people should live.
Together in this common areas instead of.
And private households will not be.
Allowed by anyone even its rulers so.
There's some pretty crazy ideas being.
Proposed here it's like plato created.
Communism not karl marx but perhaps the.
Silliest bit out of the myth of metals.
Which is that everyone is born not just.
From the earth but into different.
Categories so you will be born either.
There into bronze silver or gold.
Category and depending on that which.
Will determine what sort of job and what.
Group in.
Society you fit into and now at this.
Point you might think well this sounds.
Pretty awful i don't want to live in.
This city and neither should anyone and.
I think you're right to assume that the.
Whole concept of this city is not with.
The mindset of the well-being of certain.
Individuals it's it's the mindset of the.
Well-being of the whole state and i.
Think it's pretty interesting how.
Completely opposite our ideas around.
Individuality is today and there's.
Obviously good cause for that and good.
Reason for that but i think there's.
Examples of today of individual focus.
That almost seem comical there's a lot.
Of famous dystopian x' written around.
This sort of ideas i think we have.
Dystopian novels such as 1984 brave new.
World we buy as a mutant who may have.
Inspired all of these and these were.
Authors who lived to see the effect of.
Communism and to tell it to tell it.
Arianism and probably written as a.
Reaction to that we have brave new world.
Which really fits into the socratic idea.
Of the myth of metals where all the.
People in this novel are born from tests.
And labs they don't have a mother or.
Father they they they are born in this.
Factory and you they also fit into these.
Groups as well they are born into this.
Different ranked groups in society and.
Everyone is happy with being part of.
Their own group big brother of course.
Also with the idea of the state being.
This family figure almost i don't know.
If that really fits but you understand.
My point we we attend where there is no.
Individualism you are born as a number.
And as the name implies itself it's oh.
It's all about the group and not your.
Your own well-being basically according.
To socrates there will be no money in.
This city which is a very interesting.
Topic in itself as well i dementors he.
Loves goals he sees is that something.
Preposterous and he says that if there's.
No gold then people won't the city won't.
Be able to defend itself because no one.
Will come to its aid if they can't pay.
Them but socrates claims that any.
Neighbouring city will happily come to.
Its aid because they have obviously the.
Best warriors i've completely skipped a.
Part about how they grow how they train.
Their warriors it's very interesting but.
Since they have the best warriors that.
Doesn't care about money there will be.
Everything left after the battle to.
Plunder for themselves.
Since this city does not permit it i.
Think socrates recognizes that money is.
Not necessarily a good but it's also not.
Necessarily something bad here we go.
Again with boohoo millionaire complaints.
About money that's not the case i think.
I view it in a very similar way i think.
Money is good if you spend it well but.
It's not as if i have a pile of money at.
Home that i worship and that that in.
Itself brings me joy when you have money.
You worry about losing money and saying.
You can take for example anyone at the.
Stock market it seems like a very.
Stressful profession and i think a lot.
Of people have the view that if only.
They had money then then they would be.
Happy but there's so many examples of.
People winning the lottery and then.
Turning up more unhappy than they used.
To be because their whole worldview has.
Changed in their whole whole life have.
Changed because of month i think there's.
Even a.
Science and that data behind this now.
Showing that after a certain point of.
Money you you don't become more happy.
Because probably implies more troubles.
Which i can agree with more money no.
Problem he said it the best.
Or was it biggie yeah another.
Interesting topic around this as well as.
Its expansionism where socrata says this.
City will not expand beyond a certain.
Point because by limiting the size of.
This city they can make sure that it can.
Maintain its ruling there's so many.
Examples of in history of we had.
Napoleon the the constant expanding.
Eventually leading to its demise and i.
Think the same thing ties in with gold.
As well when you have when you have it.
You just want more and more of it.
Eventually leading to your own.
Destruction here i am making videos.
Why now we're on book five everyone.
I haven't mentioned this but basically.
There's ten books of that republic but.
They can sort of be seen as chapters.
Instead and it gets even more strange at.
This point.
Socrates brings up the topic of.
Selective procreation where another.
Great light that will be told by the.
State which is that everyone's partner.
Will be determined through a lottery.
State lottery where basically your.
Sexual partner it's completely by chance.
Or so they are will be told of course.
The state will instead put together the.
Most desirable or admirer below that.
They want more of in this city to breed.
The best kind of people in the city and.
Also avoid any form of incest because.
Obviously people don't know who their.
Real mothers and fathers are so it's.
Also necessary for that sense i think.
They follow the same storyline in we.
Said yet and savvy athens we.
Where everyone has their set partner in.
This dystopia i think it's interesting.
How they bring up this topic for nearly.
2000 years ago of genetics and and their.
And reproducing we're getting to a point.
Where we'll in the future most likely be.
Able to i think i read in an in another.
Book where people i think it was stephen.
Hawking actually he pointed out how.
People with will eventually manipulate.
The dna so that this superior people.
Will come into existence we can we can.
Change dna in a way that we can craft.
Certain individuals for certain purposes.
And socrates was playing with the idea.
Even 2,000 years ago i think that's.
Interesting in book five as well we get.
To hear a little bit of plato's ideas.
Around feminism which is not the best.
Way to put it.
I don't think i think most people don't.
Think that socrates or plato had any.
Sort of ideas we have today but he.
Recognizes that men and women are.
Different by nature but in terms of.
Ruling who can be a ruler he sees no.
Difference between a man and a woman and.
That they they are both fit for the role.
I think even now most people aren't too.
Used to women being in a leadership but.
Again 2,000 years ago socrates.
Recognized that there is no difference.
Which can be seen as a sort of.
Progressive thought to put forward.
Especially with the mind of how poorly.
Women were treated back in ancient greek.
I think they all they had to do was stay.
At home all day taking care of the house.
And they were generally treated poorly.
As far as i know but then again you.
Could also just see it as recognizing.
That women can get what men already have.
So so who then are the most fit to rule.
This city i'll let you get.
That's right philosophers i gotta say.
Soccer today they're a little bit of an.
Elitist it really feels like.
So since philosophers they seek truth.
Above all else and therefore their.
Rationale and their rational part of the.
Soul will ruled the city and best ruled.
The city so socrates has a very.
Interesting view of leadership which in.
A way i agree with but it's also.
Extremely pessimistic he says that if.
You look at how we determine a leader in.
Democracy it is a very long process to.
Go through with anyone that wants to.
Become a leader is up for a tremendous.
Task of going through a public election.
It's not something that anyone is.
Willing to go through with to become a.
Leader in our democracy.
You must truly want to become a leader.
And socrates argues that the one most.
Fitted to rule is the one that wants to.
Rule the least and he brings up this.
Example of a boat where a couple of.
Seamen or a couple of seafarers are on.
This boat they're travelling to this.
Destination but everyone is arguing over.
Who should steer the ship was the one.
Who is most fit to steer the ship is the.
One focusing on the stars and they're.
Looking at the stars to try and navigate.
Instead which is what they should be.
Doing so the person most fit to steer.
The ship is the one focusing on what.
They need to do to steer the ship.
Instead of arguing why they should steer.
The ship i explained this very poorly.
But i think you understand the point.
Therefore according to socrates the one.
Who wants to rule the least isn't the.
Most appropriate to rule but they will.
Also never become the ruler because they.
Don't seek it and this is pessimistic in.
The sense that it implies that the ship.
Cannot make it to the shore even if.
People are arguing which is obviously.
Not the case next up we get into.
Metaphysics which i find a little hard.
To understand still and therefore i will.
Try in my best.
I do understand the allegory of the cave.
And i think that's the probably the best.
Way to introduce the idea of the the.
Idea of the good as socrates describes.
It.
Socrates recognizes the world as.
Something that can be described beyond.
Our senses he uses math as an example.
2+2 will always be for no matter where.
You are in the universe when certain.
Things according to our eyes and our.
Vision in our senses will appear.
Differently depending on our subjective.
Manners colors is something it's a color.
Red red for everyone you understand what.
I mean.
But 2+2 will always be for socrates.
Brings up here in book 7 the most famous.
Metaphor in philosophy or western.
Philosophy at least i talked about this.
Before on in my video and you might have.
Heard it already which is the famous.
Allegory of the cave.
It's something that i discussed in my.
Simulacra and simulation video and i.
Used it in the context of simulation.
Which funny enough still applies but.
Socrates brings up the allegory of the.
Cave as a way to describe education i.
Want you to try and imagine a very dark.
Cave and in this cave there are a couple.
People in a row and these people are.
Completely immobilized they cannot move.
Any inch of their body that cannot move.
Their head imagine clockwork orange'.
Style strapped down to this in this cave.
With chains the only thing these people.
Can see is the cave wall in front of.
Them now this wall has a bunch of.
Shadows cast upon them because there is.
A light behind them and in front of this.
Light there are people crossing a bridge.
So what the prisoners in the chains can.
See on the wall are just shadows all.
These people moving back and forth and.
Since these people have never.
Experienced anything else in their life.
For them and what their senses are.
Telling them is that these shadows are.
Real because they don't know any other.
Truth so eventually in this allegory of.
The cave one of the prisoners managed to.
Escape his chain.
And his worldview is of course then.
Completely changed he sees people that.
Are real he sees a whole new dimension.
Essentially and so kurtis describes this.
Experience as very painful something.
Very painful to go through but.
Eventually a satisfying experience but.
He isn't the prisoner isn't completely.
Free yet and he managed to escape the.
Cave in itself where he eventually gets.
Blinded by the sun again a very painful.
Experience but once it's calmed down he.
Sees he recognizes the sun the light.
Brings all things into existence he sees.
The flowers he sees the trees and.
There's this beautiful image you can see.
Its character embrace praising the sun.
Basically and this is the soccer this.
Metaphor for the idea of the good the.
Sun bringing that the true forms see i'm.
Not really good at explaining it but.
This the sun represent the form of good.
Basically and the point of education is.
To drag a person out of this cave to see.
Things how they actually really are and.
Not just feeding information to you.
Not everyone can escape this cave and.
Therefore socrates thinks that the.
Person who escaped the cave needs to.
Come back that philosopher-king needs to.
Come back from the cave to rule in book.
Eight socrates steps back from.
Describing the the republic of the city.
And he instead takes some time to.
Describe different forms of regimes he.
Describes a democracy a an oligarchy.
Democracy and finally a tyranny and i.
Will kind of brush over this because i.
Don't know it that well and i kind of.
Want to say any form of time i have at.
This point but i think what's important.
Here is how he notes that each one of.
These different rulings are are worse.
Than the other and that in the last.
Stage which is when democracy the most.
Free form of city that there is will.
Eventually fall into tyranny that most.
Limited the least free city socrates.
Says that the desire.
Or freedom will eventually lead to not.
Having proper rulers it will give the.
Chance for a tyrant to rise and i think.
It's very very interesting how.
Accurately truckers test depicts the the.
Rise of the tyrant two thousand years.
Ago more than two thousand years ago he.
Accurately depicts something that has.
Already happened to as many times you.
Have the example of saddam hussein.
Hussein who our last known tyrant who.
Rose to power through democracy i think.
And he started off by doing a lot of.
Good for its people much like other.
Tyrants of our time benito mussolini for.
Example who famously made the trains run.
On time.
Saddam helped modernize infrastructure.
He helped modernize industries health.
Care system education different social.
Services farming same with hitler but i.
Will not bring up any examples because i.
Don't want to be taken out of context i.
Think you get the point the tyrant.
Starts from a democracy and and does.
Good for its people.
But as socrates describes the tyrant who.
Is ruled by its desires will eventually.
Get the taste of blood it will do.
Something to an opposition he will.
Execute one of its enemies and he will.
Do this in the name of the people he.
Will do it as i've done something to.
Protect you not me and once he had the.
Taste of blood that will just be the.
Start of it the tyrant who is ruled by.
His lust and desires will not just bleed.
The city dry but will become paranoid.
And kill all their enemies this loss of.
Blood will continue only the people that.
Flatter the tyrant will will keep living.
And anyone challenged in his position.
Will of course be executed and this is.
What happened to saddam assign a lot of.
In the end of his regime his military.
Power was very poor because he had.
Executed anyone and most of his best men.
Just out of sheer paranoia socrates.
Argues that the least happy man in the.
World is this ruling tyrant.
Which actually starts to make a lot of.
Sense if you think about it constantly.
Living in this fear this paranoia driven.
By your your greed and lust you can't.
Trust your friends.
Constant fear of enemies saddam even.
Himself had to move where he lived every.
Single day to protect himself so not.
Only is the ruling tyrant the least.
Happy it's also the worst worse ruling.
For a city for example iraq used to be.
So much richer before before the time.
Was saddam hussein and socrates draws.
The the opposite line that the just man.
Is the happiest man and the unjust man.
Is the least happy man so then who is.
The most happy man well of course you.
Could probably guess that's right the.
Philosopher everyone is anyone surprised.
Again such an elitist according to.
Socrates the one seeking truth is the.
Greatest pleasure of them all and only a.
Philosopher will know this because he's.
Experienced all the pleasures it even.
Makes a really strange joke about it.
Saying that the philosopher king is 729.
Times more happier than the ruling.
Tyrant which obviously it's a joke.
You cannot quantify such a thing i think.
There's a reason behind the number i.
Just don't remember it let me know in.
The comments socrates also draws a.
Conclusion between the three parts of.
The city at the three classes and the.
Three parts of the soul i cannot get.
Into it i'm sorry.
I just remember it didn't really made.
Sense to me the idea of the soul from.
Socrates but finally we made it to the.
End book ten where socrates brings up.
The view of the afterlife he talks about.
The myth of error which is a warrior who.
Died in battle and he then goes to the.
Afterlife with has a bunch of people in.
It kind of like an airport and he sees.
How the system works and basically.
People will have to serve a thousand.
Years in heaven or a thousand years in.
Hell based on how you lived your life.
That this is where you go but after.
Serving this thousand years you will.
Then get to pick a new life again and.
Here again according to socrates only.
This philosopher.
Know how to pick the right life i think.
It's very interesting because just like.
This natural progression of different.
Type of ruling so will the person the.
Individual go through the natural.
Progression between good and evil.
Themselves they will not always make the.
Right decision of what life they want to.
Live and only the philosopher knows.
Which life is the right choice and in.
The story he will have to pick last i.
Don't know if ava's error that had to.
Pick but the character of this myth has.
To pick last between what life they can.
Live and he finds the life eventually.
Their life of what philosopher and he.
Says this is the life i would have.
Chosen even if i got to pick first and.
He was not very happy with this decision.
He picks this life of a philosopher an.
Ordinary man who minds his own business.
And that is the definition of justice.
According to socrates or plato minding.
Your own business and not meddling with.
Other men's concerns i think i kind of.
Brushed over the end of how it all ties.
In together with the individual and the.
City but i think this has gone on well.
Enough.
I think plato's republic is such a.
Phenomenal piece of literature it makes.
Me happy that i'm alive to even.
Experience it just from the sake of.
Taking part of these ideas that were.
Written so long ago i don't know what.
Else there exists anything like this the.
Life of socrates is so interesting as.
Well and it continues in his other books.
As well again this is why i'm so happy i.
Picked up literature because i think.
It's so interesting to take part of.
These discussion and ideas and and.
Stories whether you know it's real or.
Not i find it very very fascinating to.
Escape into i don't know what other.
Medium could possibly accomplish.
Something like this and i think republic.
Is such a great example of that.
It discusses ideas that are still very.
Much relevant today in a way that is.
Still very engaging and exciting and i.
Love reading this book i don't think i.
Would have taken so much time with it.
Otherwise and if you made it this far.
Thank you for watching it it wasn't.
Really much of a review.
I got to bring up some of my thoughts.
Around it i would obviously give it 10.
Out of 10 i'll announce the next book.
Review in as always on twitter or the.
Reddit and keep an eye for that i would.
Love to hear your thoughts and.
Discussion of the comments section or on.
The reddit i'll see you guys there.
Good bye.
