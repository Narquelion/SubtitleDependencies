Intentions are wrong dan who is this guy.
He must be absolutely the worst nicole's.
A beautiful girl yeah but she's not you.

And as bura imagine your parents.
Describing you like that on tv.
Nice nice one mom thanks mom.
Is a person not the best way there's.
This expression if you don't have.
Anything nice to say they don't say.
Anything at all and i feel like that.
Should apply your kids on national.
Television at least i know what she's.
Coming from it's like she's questioning.
What this guy's motives are i guess.
We're just gonna have to find out he's a.
Very handsome man and damn floor gang.
House understand with this 20% muscle.
Increase absolutely.
So nikola takes off to morocco that's.
Where her lover or her life is i've been.

Culture change that it will be a big.
Shot but it's very beautiful and the.
Food is amazing take good care of my.
Baby i'm trusting you i'm so curious.
Yeah that sounded sincere i think it's.
Good that he's spoken to the parents at.
Least maybe i don't know i don't know i.
Find the scientists because i obviously.
Went met my wife online in a completely.
Different country but morocco that's.
Very different from america.
I hope she's ready for it i really do.
Nicole she's my fiancee we've been.
Waiting for a long time to meet and be.
Together so that's why she come to marco.
And you know i'm really excited in that.

Friend hamza is coming because he's my.
Best friend so he want also to meet her.

Morocco you know no maracas and maracas.

Marrakech that's where i've been yet.
It's a nice place.
Yes it's a nice place it's ups and downs.
We march has made a vlog there there's.
Obviously like really bad parts of it.
But a lot of it is really beautiful i.
Don't want to it sound so forth i don't.
Know it's as funny seeing his reaction.
Cuz he knows she's gonna get shot from.
This i've been there i've been to that.
Therefore i'm about to meet the love of.
My life.
Like seriously she's like white you.
Can't miss her because she's american.
Yeah yeah alright about to meet the love.
Of my life for the first time ever.
Music.
I feel my heart wow nice microphone.
Action did you hear that okay okay can.
We stop hugging now okay when she.
Dropped her bag so dramatic i almost.
Threw up these comments are always so.
Over-the-top my god i'm hungry are you.
Seriously cut what the hell it's a long.
Flight.
Don't be so judge for the first time i.
See that she's pretty and you know it's.
Cute when i see her i mean her body i.
Was surprised that she's bigger little.
Bear i'm guessing she never sent him.
Full body pics oh so they go to the.
Market to buy some food it's like being.
Like dan if the foodie market was so.
Good.
I mean that's not what you say when it.
Was good but damn all the veggies was so.
Good there all the food was my god it's.
A bit different from potato chips on the.
Dinner table.
This is definitely different when i'm.
Used to if i even see fresh products.
It's usually in a supermarket in the.
Frigerator section that's what i'm used.
To for fresh ingredients okay so time to.
Go find some of the nuts they're going.
To get some fresh chicken you had them.
In the box.
Goddamn the smell of chicken it's the.
Best why are the chickens baby i like.
How she's acting like this is so strange.
Do you be do you not know where your.
Food comes from seems like everyone's so.
Attached detached from from it i would.
Never hurt an animal by chicken and beef.
Omnomnomnom.
Goddamn eat what you want obviously but.
I feel like we're so detached from our.
Food we made the process so easy for us.
That's why my philosophy is that i'll.
Eat what i would kill because killing.
Things is uncomfortable most people.
Wouldn't and at least there's a level of.
Respect there instead of completely.
Distancing yourself from what goes.
Through to these animals which isn't.
Fair a lot of the times it came a little.
Bit preachy there but i don't know just.
Like oh it's so weird it's in the cage.
We'll move but you're gonna kill it.
World i don't really want to see you.
Know that was taken before i go to cook.
It like i just want it to be make you.
Feel bad huh everyone hypocrite except.
Me oh i'm joking today as i'm taking me.
Some market in marrakesh and technically.
We're not supposed to hug or kiss in.
Public but that's gonna be really hard.
For me.
Oh no god girl you're in a different.
Country i've been there.
Wow making out with snakes and i didn't.
Miss out on that oh she did not like.
That and whether you agree or not aware.
It is right you're still visiting.
Someone else's country you have to be.
Respectful of that you can tell us you.
Took that personally too i mean that's.
Not even the case this is how it is.
There oh my god    me.
Yeah i can understand things no you're.
Not understanding things that's the.
Problem.
I can understand things oh man i don't.
Know i'm curious what you guys think.
This is someone else's country yeah you.
Just got him this is how it is just.
Feels entitled but i don't know i i.
Don't know woman who likes like physical.
Affirmation you know hugs and kisses and.
Even like little weird.
Cute things you know just physical stuff.
I guess it's like reassuring that you.
Know he just thought he looks so done.
You know he's happy with me i don't know.
It's just like not being able to do.
Those things it really sucks like it's.
Really upsetting sucks it's so upsetting.
I can't do whatever i want.
They set this up to make it seem like he.
Was the bad guy but i don't know man i.
Ain't seen any of it so far at leaves so.
She ran out and he just tried to stop.
Her if she doesn't get her weight around.
He's not dragging her around he was.
Trying to protect her why are you.
Yelling.
You're the not paying this guy does not.
Like arguing in public trying to tell me.
How to be we're just pretty better and.
I'm a little worried that we're already.
Having an argument on the first day.
We in the first day that i'm here and i.
Was already thinking he could just tell.
Me to shut up this time he's really.
Gonna learn quick that that's not what.
He can do.
I'm amazed mom and i just need you to.
Listen you know what are they even.
Arguing about god this is exhausting to.
Look at yeah ever feeling this is not.
Gonna work out.
I just a hunch i wanted to give her like.
Chocolates you said i can't do it to her.
Yeah now she can have brain it's like.
Really not hilton the chicken is good.
For her chicken like chicken nuggets are.
Not bad i don't know about you but i.
Wouldn't take health advice from from.

Stay-at-home mom like your sister and.
Your mom was or i can't why is this.

Trying she seems like the kind of person.
That tries once ah this is impossible i.
Can't do this oh man you promised me.

Think that she'll go to gym and eat.

Doesn't work out your camera rise sex.
Music.
Cam will be like brah he sprinkles the.
Word honey and sentences for damage.
Control that's good cameron be like wait.
That thing is gonna ride me obviously.
You shouldn't have to change completely.
For your partner that's not it at all.
But a partner can help you inspire you.
To be happy more healthier that's not a.
Bad thing i'm not trying to shame anyone.
For being out of shape either i know.
It's hard losing weight a lot of a lot a.
Lot of people struggle with it there.
It's just how it is but she seems to.
Meet it with so much anger and oh it's.
Too hard i can't do it you have someone.
There that can help you use that she.
Seems to resist him for it almost or.
Resent him i don't know that's just what.
I picked up can you please stop.
Just the arguing about you know just.
Trying to be like mocking people just.
For one month i'm not.
I know about china because me to be.
Moroccan didn't you fall in love me.
Because i'm not rocking if i see stuff.
Like this hit me it doesn't mean that i.
Don't love you okay i just woman bye i.
Love you no way and if i said things.
Like you should change it doesn't mean.
That i give up a knee or something you.
Know it's like she's given up on herself.
I'm now your perfect woman.
Boohoo me that's not it at all he's.
Trying to help you that's what i'm.
Picking up at least curious where you.
Guys think.
Honey's under and change you he's asking.
To kindly respect their culture he.
Deserves the green card for his patience.
As a moroccan myself i'm super surprised.
He stayed calm during this argument.
Because most guys would throw a tantrum.
Because you don't play no games with no.
Moroccan and especially you do not risk.
Disrespect once culture he he's been.
Very calm throughout all of this maybe.
He's just pulling it through for the.
Cameras i don't know but i can't really.
Fault him on anything so far and want to.
Be healthy but i don't think i need to.
Change myself for a man for him to love.
Me because if he loves me she loved me.
For who i am.
That attitude is like saying i'm perfect.
And i should be praised for being.
Perfect at all times obviously you love.
Someone you love someone but encouraging.
Someone to be better shouldn't be met.
With oh you don't think i'm perfect oh.
I'm not good enough for you like to go.
To gym and like to not be lazy i'm not.
Lazy some things you're do you know why.
You're asking from me right now.
Don't go 2 jaemin if that doesn't happen.
I'm not sure i'm going to america oh.
Music.
Now i want you to believe you know the.
Woman that's not comfortably okay i.
Really like him he isn't fat-shaming he.
Only wants her to be healthy is he.
Pushing her too hard and congrat later.
After she is done with the exercise.
Physically i'm talking to nicole but.
It's not like it just like 55% you put a.
Number on it are you attracted to me no.
Matter what i know i love you just.
Please what are you attracted to me oh.
My god i love this so painful how do.
They find these people it's so perfect i.
Love it it doesn't seem like that.
Interesting premise of a show but it.
Truly is so finally they go through this.
Big fight and i'm not sure what's.
Happening as always you want to escape.
From nicole or just go upstairs.
Sorry that was a load joke.
What is happening can't even look as a.
Single person i am just a bunch a group.
Of americans i'm just american to him.
Okay trump is our prep man in a way i do.
Feel for her let me try and be nice it.
Seems like she knows about the issues.
But she thinks it's too hard to overcome.
Them so once a person her life comes in.
And can actually help her to push.
Herself when she realizes that she can't.
Do it or doesn't want to do it she gets.
Frustrated at him when in reality she's.
Been frustrated with herself.
Mr. armchair psychologist over here i'm.
Sure she's sweet at some point and i'm.
Pretty sure he wouldn't see her the.
Other way.
Is he gonna confront her transform is.
Respectful to me just because of what i.
Did wait what did she do you know before.
I cheated on him things were amazing.
Uh-huh after it he did it.
Music.
Before i cheated on him.
Things were amazing and then after i.
Cheated on him things changed oh my god.
Everything was every hope i had for you.
Nicole just went out the window there my.
God how can you be so unselfish.
My accidents and consequences it's not.
Fair to me that i did something bad.
Unbelievable he took advantage of this.
Aires yeah she cheated and acts like a.
Victim oh god sounds like it is honey oh.
My god oh my god that was crazy.
I can't believe it in the beginning as.
Well family would seem so concerned like.
You know my rock is a very different.
Country it's big culture change and the.
Even the kid was like i had different.
Values different lifestyles different.
Jobs all these things and she just like.
