Everyone that joined me so far now let's.
Just get on with the video.
I broke my balls.
Music.
That's right everyone it's time for me.
To finally come clean and share one of.
My most embarrassing stories of my life.
And you might think to yourself oh i've.
Broken my balls too.
It really hurts when you smash them oh.
That's nothing.
That's nothing sorry now technically i.
Didn't break my balls okay i just need.
The titles to be consistent but let me.
Tell you what happened and he might.
Change your money.
It might make you go i don't know what.
Pain is what that man experienced that.
Was pain.
He didn't just break his a hat he also.
Broke his balls and he broke my heart.
By listening to this story so let's just.
Jump into it i was 14 years old and i.
Woke up i did what anyone that has balls.
Do when they wake up you look you look.
At that yeah i looked out on my boss and.
I noticed hmm that's a bit weird the.
Other one is like three times four times.
Maybe larger than the other one.
Hmm that's a big but of course i didn't.
Think about him more than night why.
Should i but then as the day went on it.
Was sort of lingering in the back of my.
Mind you know what maybe it isn't.
Supposed to be so much bigger has it.
Always been that much bigger maybe i.
Just never noticed.
Maybe i'm just you know girls some girls.
Have this different proportion at.
Boobies maybe i'm a disproportionate.
Ball kind of guy you know it's not great.
News it's nothing what i saw what do you.
Want to wake up realizing but that's.
What i thought at leaves but then after.
A while i realized i need to confront.
This this is not normal okay so i did.
What any person would have done if.
There's something wrong with your balls.
You show them to your dad and obviously.
That's very humiliating already you.
Don't want to show your balls to your.
Dad at least i don't.
I think the only context you're allowed.
To show your balls to your diet is in.
The sauna and now i think that's it.
That's the only context or if your ball.
Is bigger than the other one of course.
So i showed my i was freaking out okay i.
Was super worried about what was wrong.
With me.
You know worst possible scenarios is.
Running in your head.
Not like oh do i have cancer or oh am i.
Good something really bad happened it.
Was oh my god am i gonna live with this.
Proportion that balls my entire life i.
Was freaking out i showed my balls to my.
Dad and he you know whenever you're.
Worried about something the most.
Reassuring thing that you can get back.
From someone is obviously when they make.
This face hey dad can you please look at.
My balls please and make sure it's.
Nothing bad right i'll never forget that.
Face worse than any disappointment.
Realize my camera isn't really focused.
So obviously he didn't think it was fine.
What am i sharing this so we we booked.
An appointment with the doctor and i.
Think they let us in pretty quickly i.
Don't know if that's health care in.
Sweden it's good or if they thought oh.
Like oh that's not that's really bad.
Well we'll need to get this guy into the.
Hospital but i remember this hospital.
Visit unfortunately very very very.
Clearly because it was painful a very.
Painful experience i basically had to go.
Into this room and i remembered so.
Clearly they had like brown tiles and.
White walls just like hard surfaces.
Everywhere and there was this bed in the.
Middle of the room that it wasn't really.
You know like those hospital beds then.
You lay down on kind of like this just.
Imagine 14 or all mean like this.
Okay i'm laying down like this.
I'm freaking out my dad is sitting next.
To me and in comes this doctor and the.
Thing is like that what really bothers.
Me about these things is that no one.
Tells you what the courtesy is you know.
In school they teach you about math they.
Teach you by a history they teach you.
About science all these completely.
Useless things but no one teaches you.
What to do when you have to present your.
Balls to a doctor all right here's a.
Question that no one teaches you in.
School when you're supposed to present.
Your balls to someone do you give them.
The courtesy of lifting up your song it.
Would make sense right i remember going.
I remember god watch my sharing that and.
Hidden the doctor just going on put that.
Away let me get in there.
So he started croaking i'm alone and.
Obviously that's not a very good feeling.
I'm already humiliated and i had this.
Guy just going treating my boss like.
It's some sort of thing that you poke i.
Don't know what kind of things do you.
Poke but he wasn't sure i guess he.
Really wanted to make sure it wasn't.
Something really bad so he wanted some.
Expertise his help and i'm pretty sure.
He knew it was fine okay because i'm.
Pretty sure he just wanted to humiliate.
Me even farther so not just two more.
Doctors came in three more doctors came.
In and one of them happened to be a very.
Attractive lady which is like the worst.
Thing you could ever have to someone.
Just poking or just looking i would.
Rather like she poked and just looked so.
There i was in this cold room with my.
Dad next to me and i assumed they was.
Equally painful for him just think.
Doctors poking away now they concluded.
Okay we need to get the bulls and so i.
Got an appointment about a week later.
Again same dilemma this time i was alone.
My dad wasn't with me i wish it was.
Honestly for the better there was no.
Doctor in the room when i was sent in.
There as well so and i know he's gonna.
Check out my balls.
So again.
No one teaches in this school am i.
Supposed to just take off my pants and.
Wait for him pay less and be like hey.
I'm ready doctor.
Or do i wait to take off my pants i took.
Off my pants and i realized that's.
Really weird.
Can you imagine just coming in and some.
Oh hey doctor i'm ready poked away this.
Time they just used some sort of scanner.
I don't know exactly what it was it.
Wasn't that it wasn't painful at all.
This time maybe it's one of those.
Experiences that once you've done it.
Once it's not that bad i like to think.
Of it that way at least link what.
Doesn't kill you make you stronger.
At least now if someone needs to inspect.
My balls i can i can do it proudly but.
They concluded it was just my blood.
Vessel in my balls had expanded dad-like.
Became larger so that was it that's the.
Story of how my balls are slightly.
Larger than average nobody baby boy now.
I want the moral of this story to be you.
Know this is obviously a very.
Embarrassing experience but i also.
Consider myself very lucky to have balls.
I think anyone that i have balls feel.
Very privileged to have them not that.
Then i'm not discriminating against.
Anyone without balls just let that be.
Clear i'm just saying i'm very happy to.
Have my balls what was the point of this.
Video i'm very lucky to have balls i'm.
Very lucky to have my point i'm very.
Lucky to be healthy but i'm not.
Discriminating against anyone okay and.
Also as some painful and embarrassing.
This experience once it's something that.
I can look back at and laugh at and not.
Just cringe into oblivion so if you have.
Any issues with your balls go and get.
Your balls checked.
Go show your balls to your dad anything.
You got to do just do it because it's.
Better to find out you know i was lucky.
That it was nothing but it's better to.
Find out these things sooner and if.
There's any message i want to send out.
There it is that just that show your.
Balls to your dad that's really the only.
Message of this video and i really hope.
This helps people i'm doing this so i.
Can help other people i've actually had.
My balls checked three times which is.
Three times too many.
Music.
Now four times.
Why does these things happen to me.
What's breaking my ass not enough i.
Think i shared enough about this.
Experience but i do feel better i gotta.
Say this is very therap etiquette for me.
Thank you for listening and i see you.
Next time.
That's the story of how my balls are.
Slightly larger than average.
Music.
What you never played toupper simulator.
You know it's fun right i'm not supposed.
To give my opinion.
But give it a try and then you can tell.
Me if it's good or not not convinced yet.
Okay i'll cut you a deal.
The game is available for free and.
That's a great price.
Music.
