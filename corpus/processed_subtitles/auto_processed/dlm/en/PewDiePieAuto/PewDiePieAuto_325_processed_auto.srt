Apology video time how i'm gonna record.
This video dude james charles legendary.
Apology to tati now with 47 million.
Views god damn up on its way to becoming.
The most viewed apology video of all.
Time almost beating logan paul's so.
Sorry for my severe lapse of judgment 55.
Million views.
I bet logan is actually heard about that.
Dammit my apology video is number one.
Most people would be like ooh finally.
People moved on to another cut i don't.
Know i'm just joking anyway yeah now i.
Think it's safe to say that people.
Didn't like this apology video not just.
From losing i what is it now.
Over three million subscribers but for.
Having three million dislikes on the.
Video and i always say just come to me.
If you need to make an apology video.
Just come to me so this doesn't happen.
Alright.
When will you learn wait will you learn.
So therefore we will go through what's.
Wrong with this apology video what's.
Right about it spoilers not much so.
Without further ado hi now james is.
Doing the classic i'm just gonna turn on.
The camera and talk for eight minutes.
Which i can appreciate in the sense of.
At least you know he doesn't have a.
Script.
It's just speaking his emotions but at.
The same time you have a lot of people.
Angry james you wanna be clear and.
Concise with what you're gonna say.
Generally if you want to get a message.
Across any message okay the number one.
Rule of information is the easier the.
Message is to say the quicker it will.
Spread right and to just turn on the.
Camera and bla bla bla bla bla bla bla.
Isn't gonna do that okay.
I'm currently traveling abroad and just.
Woke up but i wanted to sit down and.
Make a video addressing all everything.
Going on right now okay so so far what.
15 seconds in he said nothing that we.
Can already tell by just watching this.
Video alright you just woke up hey guys.
I just woke up from my hair.
Can you tell even though i apparently.
Sleep with earrings on.
So that makes no sense i owe everybody.
An explanation but most importantly i.
Owe to important people an apology to.
Talk to you and james westbrook i'm.
Sorry for everything that is going on.
Everything that i have put you through.
Over the past few weeks it looks like.
He's about to sneeze what is that that's.
Great i love that god damn this who.
Speaks slowly again if you want the.
Message across you might want to be a.
Little quicker so he apologized to tati.
Which in a way you know it's big of him.
To do but at the same time it just.
Reaffirmed was kind of it everything she.
Said you know if you make it a mistake.
Apologizing is the right thing to do.
Without a doubt but if you made a.
Mistake with someone else when people.
Don't really know what happened to just.
Flat-out apologize seems to me like.
Everything they said was right i met.
Tati and james.
Almost three years ago now when i was.
First coming into the industry and when.
I had no friends and nobody to talk to.
Or look up to and tati very quickly took.
On a parental role with me because she.
Knew my parents were across the country.
And.
Over the past few not her family i think.
Another thing worth mentioning here is.
That this video has more views than.
Taught this video so i understand that.
He's trying to explain some context.
Behind the situation of how he met conte.
What if you don't know who patti is it's.
Just so bad a lot of money most of my.
Career over the past few years has been.
About me making mistakes and trying to.
Learn and grow from them and they.
Haven't always done the best job of that.
Hey james i guess we're not so different.
You and i can't really be too harsh on.
Him okay always trying well try harder i.
Was really curious about james past.
Controversies because i don't know.
Anything about him but tachi said.
Something about it boil it all a scandal.
And everyone was really afraid that he.
Was very toxic so what do you do this is.
Last year i can't believe we're going to.
Africa today oh my god what if we get.
Ebola james were fine we've gotten it as.
Sheep oatley last year what we could.
Have gone to a shovel what let's keep.
There's a lot of people watching me and.
Then a lot of people look up to me as a.
Role model and i hate knowing that i.
Disappointed not really them but most.
Importantly to people that have been.
Role models to me doing this.
Um i wish that i could say this is the.
Last time that i would make a mistake.
That won't be what a train wreck yeah.
You know if you're gonna apologize maybe.
It's not the best to lead with i'm gonna.
Make more mistakes guys like before.
Anyone's even seen that you've made any.
Effort to improve i'm still gonna make.
More mistakes guys this is just adding.
More fuel to the flame at this point i'd.
Be lying if i said i'm still gonna make.
Some moves these guys i know that i'm.
Just the point people more and more as i.
Continue to learn and grow every single.
Day i'm gonna go very long way to go i.
Like how it seems like he catches.
Himself smiling there and then it's like.
Oh god.
Need to follow up with a pretty long way.
To go here's where you say i'm still.
Gonna make mistakes.
After you've acknowledged that you're.
Trying to improve not before jesus.
Christ and be the best version of me.
That i possibly can be i'm know i'm not.
Perfect i'm still gonna make mistakes.
So stupid i'm sorry in regards to the.
Coachella situation with the brand deal.
On the security guard i've already told.
My truth about this twice and instead of.
Talking about it for a third time and.
Explaining it and going into detail and.
Pulling up receipts it doesn't matter.
It does matter james i've tried my best.
To look into this drama i have no idea.
What happened okay people don't know.
What happened so you might want to.
Address it okay just because you've said.
It twice doesn't mean that everyone's.
Already heard it okay clearly you have a.
Lot of new eyes on you here you want to.
Treat this video as if someone.
Completely new to you who's only heard.
About you from this scandal and give the.
Context from there to say that you've.
Already explained it doesn't mean.
Anything.
I.
Understand that no matter what i say and.
Then he follows it up with probably the.
Dumbest line you could say one of the.
Dumbest line i've heard in an apology.
Video i understand that no matter what i.
Say or do they're always gonna be people.
That don't believe me and will think.
That i am lying yes yes you're not wrong.
But why god sir would you say that.
That's like insulting these people that.
You're trying to persuade in your.
Apology like you have all these new eyes.
On you that are gonna look at you.
Extremely critically and to say doesn't.
Matter what i say you're not gonna.
Believe me anyway like yes technically.
You're not wrong people are very riled.
Up right now and in a way it probably.
Doesn't matter that much what he says.
But at the same time to say that it's.
Such a dumb idea there's plenty of.
Things that yes technically you're right.
But to say that in this context is a bad.
Idea there's a bad idea james that's.
Okay at this point the truth really does.
Not matter even worse following about.
The truth doesn't matter you're all just.
So wrong about me then tell us tell us.
People don't know they haven't heard you.
Talk about these things he talks about.
How the boys situation where he has been.
Hitting on a bunch of straight people.
He's been very public about this and.
He's saying i wish i wasn't public about.
It instead of saying i wish i didn't do.
That he just says i wish i didn't tell.
People i did that great idea boys have.
Been a topic that i've talked a lot.
About.
My social media journey and it's a topic.
I wish i hadn't people think what you.
Did was wrong to say that you just wish.
You didn't tell people about it instead.
Of i acknowledging that what you did was.
Wrong is really strange but.
Coincidentally enough talk to you really.
Once one of the people to set me down.
And tell me how it looked from the.
Outside and let me know hey talking to.
These boys might get you in trouble one.
Day and she was right in regards to so.
He just brushed through the whole boy.
Situation without any acknowledgment of.
That being wrong good job why why why.
Why are you dressing your mom is this.
How he talks to his mom they don't text.
Each other they don't call each other.
They just talk through his youtube.
Channel no matter what if anybody is.
Saying or commenting or talking about.
Person anyway sorry i i know this is not.
A laughing moment but it seems like he.
Wanted to run round this up on an.
Emotional part and bringing up your.
Parents when you've disappointed it's.
Obviously gonna hit anyone really hard.
That's just how i interpreted this i.
Can't understand why else he would just.
Bring up his parents maybe to get some.
Sympathy i don't know it's really weird.
An apology video should be to the people.
You're apologizing here and then you're.
An amazing mother.
And i don't know what i'ma do without.
You.
Well she clearly didn't do a good job.
For me and the lessons that you have.
Taught me and and everything that you.
Continue to do for me and my brother i.
Need you to know that i need you to know.
That all right okay chill out james and.
The same thing goes for talk to you as.
Well who is an amazing person what goes.
To tandy i already forgot what he said.
He speaks so goddamn slowly my god.
Don't waste people's time i feel i.
Watched it all at seven minutes it feels.
Like an hour and truly does want the.
Best for everybody around her i wonder.
How many people actually watch the whole.
Thing i doubt many people did it's so.
Boring my god i'm so disappointed to.
Myself that i hurt her.
End the video james some a lot of times.
When i kind of address things in the.
Past oh my god i keep it on today out of.
Impulse and i've gone off that what the.
Hell is this how is this not an impulse.
A lot of other times i got in drama i.
Reacted an impulse you uploaded this the.
Day after this video did nothing but add.
More fuel to the flame you want to take.
At least one day off for people to say.
What they need to say about you so then.
You can come in and also for you.
Yourself to kind of take in what's going.
On and not just immediately going oh i'm.
Sorry.
It doesn't matter what i say you're not.
Gonna believe me anyway and tried to.
Pull a receipt it's probably too dumb to.
Be able to do that anyway i know that's.
Kind of mean to say but patty's clearly.
Way smarter than james she's got more.
Experience there's no way even if you.
Had the fact that he would be able to.
Pull that off there's almost he's just.
Admitting defeat at this point the video.
Goes on i can't i can't literally.
Actually not finish it here's the thing.
This video did nothing now it's been a.
Couple days since it's been uploaded and.
What's gonna be the follow-up he's.
Already said he's not gonna address.
Anything because people aren't gonna.
Believe him anyway so what is he gonna.
Do now people just added more and more.
Rumors and speculations because you.
Didn't address any of it and people are.
Very confused of what actually happened.
So he can't come back and explain the.
Situation how is he gonna come back from.
This i don't know and i think that's why.
This is such a terrible apology video.
And also literally all he had to do in.
My opinion this if i was james charles.
The way i would have done it is to say.
Explain the context of your personality.
Change of you becoming this ugly figure.
You can explain i'm very young i became.
Extremely so sex no not extremely that.
Would be gloating but i became very.
Successful very quickly and that has had.
A very negative impact on my personality.
And now that i've heard people around me.
I realized that and then so hurt that it.
Took me this long to understand this.
And then i'm gonna take some time off to.
To focus on rebuilding these.
Relationship and saving these.
Relationships and also taking time to.
Focus on improving myself because i know.
That's what i need to do now more than.
Anything i'm sorry to everyone that i.
Hurt and i'm sorry to everyone that i.
Disappointed at least then you said.
These things you've acknowledged that.
What you did was wrong and that you're.
Gonna improve and then when you come.
Back you have something to come back to.
I don't know how james is gonna come.
Back from this i think this actually.
Could be the end i don't know he's still.
So young however and people don't tend.
To care about these things for too long.
So i think he'll be fine but i think it.
Again another testimony of how you.
Express yourself in a controversy will.
Massively affect your career they could.
Make it worse or they could make it.
Better this one definitely made it worse.
Which is why you should come to me now.
I'm joking about like oh you should come.
To me about apology videos and that.
Might seem like i'm super calculative.
About my apology videos i think luckily.
I've been able to speak for in an honest.
Way and i think that also matters more.
Than anything but when you have so many.
Emotions going when you're in the middle.
Of a controversy like this it's easy to.
Get sidetracked and and confused about.
What you're doing what do you think.
About this apology smash like subscribe.
If you haven't and i'll see you guys.
Next time.
Bye what you never played super.
Simulator you know it's fun right i'm.
Not supposed to give my opinion but give.
It a try and then you can tell me if.
It's.
Not convinced yet okay i'll cut you a.
Deal the game is available for free and.
That's a great price.
Music.
