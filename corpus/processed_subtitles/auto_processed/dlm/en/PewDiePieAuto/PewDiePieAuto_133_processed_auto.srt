Alright typing i'm not really used to.
This keyboard.
Oh god once upon a time there was an old.
Mother pig who had three little pigs and.
Not enough to food to feed them so when.
They were old enough okay here we go.
Oh god ole mother pig who had three.
Little pigs and not enough food to feed.
Them so when they were old enough she.
Sent them out in to the world to seek.
Their fortunes the first little pig was.
Very lazy he didn't want to work at all.
And he built his house ah oh ah no no.
Damn was that good almost 100 words per.
Minute.
100 100 percent accuracy how is that.
Good or bad i can't tell let's see oh.
Damn i came into this like a joke i'm so.
Good i feel pretty confident maybe i'm.
Not so dumb after all this has nothing.
To do with intelligence but hey i'll.
Take it iq tests next maybe oh god we.
Only have memory back left and i'm so.
Bad at memory okay mo what what happened.
At 13 14 okay most people can do 9 all.
Right if i can be most people that's.
Really the goal here okay so remember.
The the pattern yeah i remembered the.
Pattern alright easy so the average is 9.
It's it's very easy in the beginning it.
Must be like a big learning curve after.
9 see i'm already struggling okay come.
On oh god.
Did i do it i'm missing one no i got it.
Okay i feel like that was an easy one.
I'm missing something.
Oh shoot ah i really only just looked at.
This i did it what no what happened oh.
That's easy.
Oh god.
13 all right i'll take it.
I kind of messed up i can definitely do.
Better but who cares at this point.
Verbal memory yeah my cell was.
Complaints i forget stuff so here we go.

God i'm see i'm not good at these god.
Dammit top-40 told you yeah memory i.
Can't do it.
Same with numbers man same with numbers.
This is just pain from now on what was.
The number i legit was it a night i.
Didn't look yeah god how do you guys.
Remember e this is really fun four four.
Five four okay yeah for my boy see i.
Really struggle the numbers like.
Whenever i have to remember passcodes.
36.5 it's so tough 36 so five four six.
Three seventeen but i said it wrong in.
My head that i got to do that again come.
On i said it wrong in my head it doesn't.
Count if i say it wrong in my head i.
Can't really talk and and do this at the.
Same time these are really weird cuz i.
Really focus on one bit and i for some.
Reason if i focus on one the other one.
We'll just stick like the last one i see.
Well there's be in my quicker memory see.
I didn't even try to remember the last.
Numbers but they just stuck somehow it's.
Really weird.
Actually now i did the opposite that was.
Way easier i should memorize the last.
Part and then just look at one part and.
Type it in as fast as i can okay five.
One three nine seven five one three nine.
Seven five one three nine seven five one.
Three nine seven five one three nine.
Seven five one three nine seven five one.
Three nine seven see that works that's.
So cheating what is the average on this.
Oh god i'm.
I shouldn't be bragging most people can.
Do this ok 9 4 6 4 6 1 9 4 6 4 6 1 9 4 6.
I beat the average hey you ok so most.
People really struggle around 10 and 11.
Let's see if this strategy works ok 40.
6 9 40 40 1 3 6 9 40 40 i think i didn't.
Get it i didn't look at the first.
Numbers good enough yeah there you go.
I'm not i'm not good at numbers clearly.
