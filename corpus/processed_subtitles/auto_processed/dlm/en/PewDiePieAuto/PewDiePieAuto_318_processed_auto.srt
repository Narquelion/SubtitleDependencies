Everyone did an oopsie.
Music.
My name is glue.
Music.
Area border and you're watching the most.
Respectable news site outlet of all time.
That is not our personal bias that is.
Just straight-up facts now some news for.
A lesser media outlet bus feed everyone.
Pathetic buzzfeed prints a one-off.
Magazine wow that's incredible.
Wow how innovative going back to print.
What a great idea and put momo on the.
Cover this is phenomenal work by speed.
Good job by speed you really did you're.
Really outdone yourself this time by.
Speed can i sound a little bit more.
Condescending so this was on my twitter.
Newsfeed for some reason twitter decided.
Hey you want to know about this.
Buzzfeed everyone it's a and i loved all.
The responses to this basically no one.
Cares.
Good call moving to brain booming.
Industry so you're telling me the.
Creative director said when history.
Looks back at bus feeds number one issue.
We want the iconic mama to be undercover.
Well well well too bad there won't be.
Any history for buzzfeed i know this is.
So sad last month it was reported that.
As many as 2,100 people have lost their.
Media jobs in the past two weeks.
Buzzfeed having a cut of 15% of its.
Staff this is so sad okay i'm not giving.
My opinion but i'm literally shaking and.
Crying right now.
Buzzfeed who hire such amazing people.
Like joe bernstein oh god no no i lied.
Not vice to vice laying off ten.
Percenter they were of course vice at.
Are such incredible journalism i mean.
This is a huge blow for journalism how.
Are we possibly going to survive now.
Obviously people losing their job is not.
To be celebrated but but kind of hard to.
Feel bad for companies that have run.
These smear campaigns and not just.
Against me but other people as well are.
You supported a keep thinking they can.
Do this kind of stuff without getting.
Away with it obviously there are many.
Factors involved but i find it ironic.
And funny how a buzzfeed two years ago.
After the wall street journal scandal.
Posted about my downfall writing his.
Downfall fields and the capitalist it.
Feels non conformist it makes us feel.
All the things we love to feel when.
Trying to prove we're better than that.
Well well well what a downfall indeed.
Have fun buzzfeed i'll be laughing all.
The way.
Next news next news comes from captain.
Marvel that's right y'all know i would.
Talk about this the reason why i haven't.
Done a few news in a while this i.
Haven't been too invested in what's.
Happening and it's been kind of nice to.
Be honest but this is one of those news.
That you just can't you can't escape.
It's been literally everywhere.
Recommended in all the feeds rotten.
Tomatoes explains why it removed.
Thousands of audience reviews on captain.
Marvel's opening day well i don't even.
Have to research this disney paid that.
That is not facts that is just pure.
Speculation but it also most importantly.
Is my opinion basically if you don't.
Know what happened here the captain.
Marvel audience score review on ron.
Tomatoes was at 33% and then a lot of.
Review stirs disappeared and got deleted.
Some people were estimating over 50,000.
And now it's sitting at 55% like ratio.
Now whoever still enjoys marvel films.
You know that's that's up to you but a.
Lot of people define this as trolls you.
Know this is trolls and therefore we.
Have every right to remove their review.
You're a troll then your opinion doesn't.
Count basically is trolls that's a good.
Excuse to remove freedom of speech if.
You're a troll then you're not allowed.
To voice your opinion this annoys me so.
Much because it reminds me of the.
Goddamn amy schumer thing i don't know.
If you remember her netflix special.
Which was one of the worst thing i've.
Ever watched and ikey i watch that with.
An open mind five percent liked this.
Film according to google users after the.
Bad reviews came out on netflix from.
Name is schumer special they removed the.
Five star rating system which now makes.
It impossible to find something that you.
Actually like on nathalie.
I've just given up trying to find stuff.
From their run to maine said that it was.
A bug a bug that removed ten thousands.
Of audience review okay ron tomatoes.
Sure sure are we expected to believe.
This now you might ask yourself why why.
Was it getting bad reviews at the.
Beginning well some people obviously.
Liked the film some people described it.
As bland and not that interesting and i.
Mean considering how many marvel films.
They've done at this point it's probably.
Kind of hard to innovate personally i.
Think a lot of people dislike this film.
Because of the main cara main actress.
Brie larson who is probably one of the.
Most unlikable lead female characters.
I've seen in a long time i mean just and.
One more question um what does it mean.
To be a woman in film it means it's.
Really hard and if you're a woman of.
Color then it's really really hard god.
Everyone just wants to be a victim don't.
Think imagine being the lead lead of a.
Multimillion what is it like 500 million.
Was the pledge for this baby doesn't.
Matter and then say it's really hard to.
Imagine being attractive being paid.
Millions and then going it's so hard.
Like jesus christ imagine being the.
Figure of a female strong character and.
Going it's really hard jesus christ.
Now what's ironic about this whole.
Situation but review skins removed is.
That libra and larson hundra herself in.
The past expressed that she doesn't like.
The way the system of reviews is done.
Because a movie that she liked what was.
It a tangle in time or something was.
Called a wrinkle in time got bad reviews.
Her response to that was basically well.
It wasn't made for you 67% of white men.
Are making these reviews that's why it.
Got bad reviews because it wasn't made.
For white man okay released findings.
That 67% of the top critics reviewing.
The 100 highest-grossing movies in 2017.
Were white males less than a quarter.
Were white women and less than 10% were.
Unrepresented men.
Only 2.5 percent of those top critics or.
Women of color it's important to note.
The fact here that brie larson doesn't.
Hate white man and i'm also saying i.
Don't hate white dudes i'm just saying.
I'm not supposed to give my opinion but.
I'm just saying am i saying that i hate.
White dudes no i'm not let me try and.
Unwrinkled this she hates white students.
Or i and for the third time i don't hate.
White dudes now whether you agree with.
Her or not.
I think her politics is what muddled.
People's opinion about her at least and.
I think that's fair you know not.
Everyone wants to politics and.
Everything and i see it is getting kind.
Of knowing at this point i think what.
Annoys me the most out of all this is.
It's the straw manning of if you didn't.
Like this film then that means you're a.
Troll or that you don't like seeing.
Strong female characters or yada yada.
Yada it's the same thing every time i.
Stumbled upon this footage for example.
There are people who get very bent out.
Of shape about the fact that she's a.
Woman and that buries a woman and wants.
To see women moving into an equal place.
Inhumanity to men sad it must be sad to.
Me that kind of dinosaur wandering.
Toward the tar pits ah yes.
That's why aleta battling joe was.
Getting so much hate as well that's what.
People are been out of shape over that.
Movie getting released or wonder woman.
Or literally hundreds of female main.
Character films no one cares no one is.
Making this argument that people don't.
Want equality or seeing strong female.
Character.
Whatever it was he said and wants to see.
Women moving into an equal place in.
Humanity to men or that women can move.
In tune equal plays out a man no one is.
Saying that no one maybe like a very.
Small percentage but of course anyone.
That dislike this film you don't want to.
See wither then you just don't want to.
See women moving in to the same place.
You know what people don't realize how.
Hard it is being a female news anchor.
But you don't see me complaining about.
It now 400 times more important news dog.
Showed up for story time at library but.
Nobody came to read to him no.
Unfortunately nobody signed up to read.
To sting at the white bear lake library.
I'm shaking and crying what felix this.
News was posted a year ago why are you.
Talking about this now it is still.
Relevant.
Goddamnit forbes attacks pd pi that's.
Right they wrote this article saying.
It's time to unsubscribe from pd p.
Versus t series okay alright they're.
Basically saying both channels have been.
Irresponsible prioritizing the attention.
Growth of their channels instead of.
Helping to create a wholesome youtube.
Community oh forbes just care about.
Creating a wholesome youtube community.
Support the creator's the community is.
What god involved with this i didn't.
Even start this whole thing it's the.
Community that keeps it alive and.
They've done so many incredible things.
That i'm so proud of and the reason why.
They're bringing this up is because a.
Few days ago it came up that someone.
Defaced a world war 2 memorial by ab.
Writing subscribe to pewdiepie this has.
Been covered in so many different places.
And obviously it is desire it's.
Disgusting you know i don't think i've.
Done anything to condone this sort of.
Behavior but of course a forbes right.
Right after that i've said a good meme.
For a good cause.
And i sort of implying that they even.
Wrote it straight out the creator hasn't.
Made any effort to temper the extremes.
Of his fanbase what am i gonna do like.
First of all that's just not true i.
Already said in many times that don't do.
Anything legal because i would obviously.
Look bad on me but doing this sort of.
Hack print acts.
People doing protests people being.
Holding up signs all these things are.
Just amazing and really fun to follow.
And i think it's really cool no i don't.
Think i've done anything to to condone.
This sort of behavior.
Obviously it's disgusting obviously i.
Don't condone it whatsoever.
I don't know why anyone got in their.
Mind to do this it's just stupid most.
Likely it's just a kid it looks like.
They just grabbed a stone to scribe it.
In and the mix of large and small.
Letters kind of signifies it as well it.
Looks like it's many different kids it.
Looks like you could probably remove.
That pretty easily at least which i'm.
Really glad because i would hate for.
That to to be there if anyone knows if.
It has been removed please let me know.
Because it's just terrible.
Honestly don't do this i don't know it's.
Like i'm expected to say don't do this.
Obviously don't do this do i shouldn't.
Have to say it even.
But of course forbes has to go out of.
Their way to it that's it for pio news.
Hope you guys enjoyed this episode smash.
