Music.
Oh.
Blessed be thy day for it is 90 day.
Fiance time.
Yes yes yes yes yes my favorite.
I love it so much they are so crazy.
Are there any sane couples in the world.
Apparently not apparently not.
So today we're looking at mr paul.
I think that's his name he's going to.
Brazil to meet the love.
Of his wife love of his life.
English sorry i don't even speak the.
Same native language that's never going.
To work.
My other concern is he's already very.
Optimistic.
I'm doing this but it's never going to.
Work queen's hometown is so remote.
You can't drive to it the only way to.
Get there.
Is to fly into a main city and that's.
Not a big deal a river.
For several days oh what.
Where did he find this    how did.
They have internet there.
How what what is his love story.
I'm leaving in two days to make this.
Huge journey to brazil.
Nice oh wow he prepped a lot of.
Plan i got four standard military foot.
Lockers.
One standard military duffel bag and my.
Carry-on.
In case the war breaks out paul is ready.
No problem.
A heat vest to help deal with the.
Temperature we're down there.
It's a head wrap to help heat stroke or.
Heat exhaustion as you do you.
You bring those of course.
Various types of uh water filters better.
To have it and not need it than needed.
To not have it.
So i brought every single thing that you.
Could bring jesus christ.
He's bought all this product right into.
The issue of the parasitic fish.
That actually subtracted human urine and.
Actually splunk your urethra.
Nice doctor told me to basically take a.
Standard condom.
And uh delicately secure it to myself.
Without cutting out circulation of.
Course then it would come men went to.
The doctor.
To go hey i'm going to brazil i heard.
There's.
Fishes that swim up your peepee doctor.
What can i.
Do man just put on a condom you dumb.
If you're that scared doctor on the off.
Chance that a fish will swim up my.
Peepee.
What do i do he really did prepare for.
Everything.
Better to look like an idiot and be.
Protected than uh i don't know.
I don't know if that statement is true.
You're gonna wear this every day.
Only the fill is necessary when does it.
Feel necessary.
Paul what a guy is that what he's gonna.
Wear when he.
Gets introduced to their parents hey.
Nice to meet you.
There doesn't have to be any pee-pee.
Swimming uh fish around here.
Yeah do you have fish in the yard or is.
It.
Okay are you a peepee swimming fish this.
Looks very promising.
It's always a gamble with these you know.
Is that the foreigner that's gonna be.
The psychopath or is it the.
Uh the local one that's gonna be a.
Psychopath are they both psychopaths.
Well it's the morning we'll just have to.
Wait and see you never know.
There's many plots and turns very very.
Anxious.
Very nervous not sure what to expect my.
Anxiety level is.
Pretty high why would your anxiety be.
Level be high you're.
You're literally prepared for every.
Single thing.
That could happen this heavy uh two can.
Be a hundred pounds three can be 70.
Pounds.

Yeah these are too heavy.
I think you should leave a lot of this.
Stuff there these two cases aren't.
Coming back.
Good my mother's taking me to the.
Airport she's feeling extremely.
Emotional about me leaving.
What this is a doctor um.
She actually just uh snuck out and gave.
Me a little bit of her hair from her.
Comb to take with her.
What it means a lot uh what that's.
Actually something it's.
It's her hair what what happened.
What yeah oh that came out of nowhere.
Man you can't just what.
Um.

And man i could have done this and i.
Could have done that hey paul said.
Something good.

And problems for me.
But it seems like it's the list okay.
Just understand okay i'm sorry we'll.

Karine tells our parents she's not happy.
I can't.
Um she said that.
The problem is when her parents gone.
You just became a other person.
And you said that she couldn't.
Talk to other people only romantically.
Rather than she'd talk to anybody she.
Wants to.
I just don't want to talk to anybody.
Where it has intimacy involved that's it.
I understand she wants to talk to her.
Family and friends.
But when she talks to other men i mean.
I would have a problem with that too but.
I don't know what the messages were.
What's that about what are those emojis.
Handsome friends okay i mean.
Is it wrong to stereotype that people.
Are a bit flurry flirch.
Flirtatious in brazil is that a is that.
A.

Sometimes you don't listen to her.
And you make her cry yeah that's a big.
Flaw.

Frustrated okay i'm back on hey i hate.
