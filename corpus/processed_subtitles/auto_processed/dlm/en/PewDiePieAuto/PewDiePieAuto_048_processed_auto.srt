Oh my god katie price's quitting youtube.
Have you heard about it from news media.
Music.
Good evening i'm puppy's moria pd pi has.
Quit youtube the story is everywhere.
Youtube megastar pretty pike waits pd pi.
Reveals real reason he has quit youtube.
Yes quit everyone did you know did you.
Know pretty pious quit breaking.
Pewdiepie quakes youtube it this is so.
Sad no more pewdiepie guess it's just.
Gonna be me now.
Papa's moria pew die by world's biggest.
Youtube star pewdiepie quoits saying.
He's feeling very tired boo-hoo-hoo i.
Especially like this cnn one because.
It's basically pewdiepie who became one.
Of youtube's biggest stars before we're.
Seeing his career dogged by allegations.
Of racism and anti-semitism we'll be.
Away for a little while philip is taking.
A break because the racism man i can't.
Believe this god blown up i am blown.
Away that it got blown up you know this.
Is posted not just in you if you're from.
I don't know anywhere in europe or.
Whatever the this your local news might.
Have reported on this as well cuz it's.
Just one of those stories that caught.
Fire for whatever reason i think first.
Of all we should look at what i said.
Because i think the contrast is so funny.
It was at the end of my last few news.
Pappas moria i reported on it taking.
Break from youtube next year i wanted to.
Say it in advance because i made up my.
Mind i'm tired i'm tired i'm feeling.
Very tired i don't know if you can tell.
Just so you know early next year i'll be.
Away for a little while i'll explain.
That later but i wanted to give head.
That's it that's all i said.
Early next year i'll be away for a.
Little while i never said i'm quitting i.
Said i'm taking a break.
I find it so funny because the reason.
Why i announced it at the end of a video.
And i hate the announcement of the.
Announcement it's so annoying right the.
Reason why i did it because i didn't.
Want to uh play it i just wanted it to.
Be i didn't want to make a surprise for.
My audience as well and being like all.
Right some quick thing cuz that's what.
Youtubers would do if they go on a break.
They would go like i'm quitting pt pike.
Waits.
You know it's done before i get it but i.
Didn't want to do that i didn't want to.
Make a big deal out of it and then out.
Of all people news media blows it up why.
Do i have more integrity than 50 news.
Media this makes no sense.
This is all wrong this is all backwards.
I think this is a common practice in.
Media where well one person got it wrong.
So we can all just get it wrong right.
It's so dumb well there's all these.
Other news stories that reported the.
Wrong news so we can all report i don't.
Want to be all fake news but it is faith.
That it is i don't know what to tell you.
Yeah i don't understand why no one reads.
This stuff cuz it's so oh here we go.
Disney oh n word christchurch ad oh.
There we go.
We hit them all you just gotta get them.
All out there in 20 years from now i.
Quit youtube and do you think people.
Will post like 20 years ago we.
Remembered he said the n word you guys.
Remember that now i will not give my oh.
My god this is so obnoxious.
Somebody pop-ups if i release this game.
For making food thank you for posting.
Night it's taking a break from the.
Platform that launched what did they.
Change it the vlogger that's right yeah.
I don't know why they referred to it as.
A vlog sorry it had this low quality.
Version of this because they changed the.
Title he doesn't want to think about.
Vlogging anymore when did i say that.
They put it in quote right what is that.
The use those apis strove to be like oh.
No it's not an actual quote it's just we.
Just make it look like it's a quote.
Like what is that look if you look.
Closely we're not actually quoting him.
We're just putting a straw.
It's your stinky fault i'm not a blogger.
I'm not even a vlogger how do you get it.
So wrong to be fred they did change it.
Because i deactivated my twitter so that.
Now they can put quite straighter.
Because of this i got a lot of boomers.
Who don't know who i am.
And they just read that i made 25.
Million and they're like my job is so.
Hard i don't make 25 million how dare.
You take our break how could you take a.
Break my job harder.
And i make less money i feel like i have.
To explain why i'm taking a break now.
Just because this is just gonna become.
Weirder oh wait there was another.
Sentiment i read that was really funny.
Oh here we go here broke the news to.
Heartbroken fans in the latest peer news.
Video no one on my fans were heartbroken.
They knew that i was going to take a.
Break anyway and that's why i wanted to.
Make clear that i'm i decided that i'm.
Gonna do it and the reason why no one of.
My fans are heartbroken is because they.
Understand that is normal to just take a.
Break i didn't see anyone say oh my god.
So sad they already knew about it it's.
So like why are you making that up.
Alright this is addressed to all the.
Boomers i've been uploading youtube.
Videos every single day for 10 years.
Youtube is the kind of job that isn't.
Very stable they're always changing.
Legislation and rules and policies and.
Blah blah blah and it's such a new thing.
That any day it could be over for anyone.
And and that has been the process for a.
Lot of youtubers in the past so since.
I'm keeping this opportunity to be a.
Youtuber i've decided i'm gonna make the.
Most out of it no matter what and i've.
Done that and as i think a lot of my.
Success comes from the fact that i am so.
Consistent with on this platform.
I don't pre record videos because i.
Think that loses its touch and a lot of.
Things like that god damn this sounds so.
Preachy it's the point is i thought.
Youtube would be over by now for me i.
Thought i would be last like two years.
Or something like that but here i am i.
Don't want to look at myself another ten.
Years in the future and i've done the.
Exact same thing as i've done now even.
Though i really enjoy and love what i do.
I don't want to look back on my life 20.
Years later more like oh cool so i just.
Did youtube.
And i never ever did anything else it.
Just seems kind of sad to me another.
Reason i think it's important for anyone.
To take a break no matter what job you.
Have it i think that's important and.
That so much has happened there's here.
That i just been building up and up and.
Up and up and i never had never taken a.
Break before i don't know what it feels.
Like to not worry about uploading a.
Video even when i am away on on certain.
Things i'm still uploading during that.
Time so i'm just still monitoring the.
Video i'm still making sure everything.
Is good and micromanaging and i've never.
Just had a full stop so i just want to.
Know what that feels like that's it i.
Didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
But now i felt like i was forced to.
Explain it plus it will be so good.
Sometime early next year we even kept.
The honeymoon five days like even things.
Like that as a minimum and that's just.
Kind of sad and i think it's gotten.
Their point where okay it's cool i love.
You too but if i want to keep it going.
I kind of want to change a couple things.
And be able to not be so strict with it.
It's like if you're an entrepreneur you.
Put your heart and soul and and you work.
Your ass off to make this project work.
That you have right but then once you.
Made it you kind of simmer down and you.
Let it let other people take in control.
Or you might sell the company or.
Whatever you do but for me the project.
It's myself i'm there still i can't sell.
Myself i can let someone else step in so.
It's it's so i'm 100 solely dependable.
If how this channel is doing so it's.
Hard to just slack off do you understand.
Does that make sense.
Cool i don't i didn't make the whole.
Thing to be boohoo me oh it's so hard i.
Want a break that's not it at all just.
Want to be clear on that.
I understand there's jobs that are way.
Tougher than mine i'm very happy to be.
In the situation i'm not trying to i.
Don't want people sympathy i never asked.
For it next news another story that.
Interested me was the fact that tana.
Yes youtube streamy awards you to put.
Their actual actual logo on this really.
Okay here are the nominees for creator.
Of the year creator of the year why does.
Their overlay look like the h3h3 podcast.
Music.
And lets you easily see who left the.
Platform she's nominated for creator of.
The year though she doesn't leave the.
Platform for traditional media's oh.
That's hilarious there's such a gap now.
On youtube between creators and the ones.
That are so desperate to be validated by.
By mainstream media more in gray i don't.
Even open that inner beast mr. banks.
Ninja ninja okay sophia nygaard i don't.
Know myself.
Epik a kids channel tana mojo dada.
Well obviously mr. beech is gonna win it.
I mean he had such an amazing impact.
This year his growth has been insane.
He's like the one channel that doesn't.
Have any big controversy he's done good.
On this on the platform what he's done.
So many other youtubers try and.
Replicate it's obvious some of the other.
New animations did they're good okay but.
As obvious mr. bies is gonna win it.
Wait did you see the name or that's who.
You think it is it is not david dobrik.
I'm sorry david but you've won like.
Every award tonight it's only fair tana.
Applause.
Had to come out it in her pajama still.
Made it to the show it's so cringe to.
Rip on tana like yeah she's insufferable.
I don't want to make a whole deal out of.
It.
And i stood right here a year ago and i.
Literally held shane dawson's award and.
The first thing i said to all of you.
People was like i will never be creators.
Be here i'm so glad they filmed gus.
Johnson's reaction yeah guys when tanner.
Said i don't deserve this we all felt.
That.
Applause.
She's so humble she doesn't feel like.
Creator of the air she's so.
Down-to-earth she's just like us no you.
Literally don't deserve it that's why.
You feel like tanks i'm not actually mad.
About this because everyone knows award.
Shows are just fake anyway it's all.
Politics it's all based on who is there.
They want to be show that they're giving.
Away awards to people instead of just.
Having people show up in videos or not.
Accepting the award at all so the people.
That playing to the whole award show.
Thing are the people that get the award.
I've literally gotten award shows.
Writing to me saying hey we want to give.
You this award but you have to come.
There to get it and it's like no i don't.
Want it thing it doesn't mean anything i.
Literally don't even keep my awards that.
I have actually gone because i don't.
Feel proud of them.
I think it's it doesn't mean anything.
But i think the main reason you know.
It's fine that it is that way but it is.
Also kind of sad because i think it.
Could be cool to actually have it as a.
Way to actually celebrate the people.
That did something amazing this year.
Just like rewind could be something like.
That right a celebration of what people.
Accomplished or made a mark or made an.
Impact i think that's what it that's.
Literally it it doesn't have to be more.
Than that oh yeah and this was fan voted.
As well so it's it's not about who made.
The most impact it's who can get the.
Their audience to vote the most amount.
Of times right who can get their.
Audience to give you this award.
Basically and if that was genuine as.
Well like if no one if the if it was.
Just a poll and no one's told anyone to.
Go there specifically but if you tell.
Your audience over and over to go and.
Vote for you then.
Yeah it doesn't that kind of feed the.
Purpose i'm sure if mr. bies campaigned.
To win he would win but what kind of.
Award is that to accept and it's so.
Funny to me how he makes the whole thing.
Music.
As if the award was actually chosen to.
Her i hate tana mainly because she.
Promotes drugs to her 14 year old.
Audience i don't know how they are but.
Like weeds legal they're okay.
I'm so high right now and i'm not even.
On adderall that was so like i'll take.
The go forth of a 20 milligram felt like.
Five milligrams of adderall the blood i.
Wasn't gonna smoke weed today in those.
Days like this i really loved my life.
Music.
And i was like yeah those are a lot of.
You guys for some reason i've been.
Bringing me marijuana that's creator of.
The year.
I don't mean to bring up a bunch of old.
Stuff i don't want to do the whole media.
Meme but i generally haven't followed.
What she's doing i know she had that mtv.
Show did i get canceled jake paul.
Antennas mtv show was cancelled after.
