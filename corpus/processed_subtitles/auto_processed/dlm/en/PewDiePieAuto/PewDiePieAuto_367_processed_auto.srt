T4 date update dot a that obtained and.
Youtube dodi my name is mary han good.
Evening and welcome to peel news.
It's hammertime good evening welcome to.
Pornos mary ham our first story comes.
From t fuu t for who is t fool you might.
Ask he's the guy that looks like the.
Fortnight guy huh what a coincidence.
He's got 10 million subscribers on.
Youtube he is the fortnight guy right.
Now.
Ninja excuse me it's all about t fuu now.
Although maybe not for long ninja don't.
Worry.
Because t field is losing subscribers oh.
My god what did t food duty food do.
People do what did t fo do oh well t fuu.
Is suing face faves which is the client.
I don't know what it is i never know.
It's a fake i think it's a client see.
How he has set a little logo there that.
Means he's part of phase that means he's.
Super good game super bro and now he's.
Suing them that's crazy.
Ever since t foo has stopped uploading.
Or doing his streams in the report it.
Says that his contract would face is.
One-sided but i think the main thing.
That people are focused about here is.
The 80% thing one of the world's top.
Professional esports players this soon.
His gaming organization for allegedly.
Restraining his business opportunities.
And taking up to 88% hey he's got my.
Glasses.
Daddy 80% so apparently phase this clan.
This management forty few has me taking.
84 she also said that they've been.
Limiting sponsor deals obtained through.
This team basically he can only do bonds.
Are shapes through phase i think that's.
How i understand it and if you spoke a.
Few days prior about sort of not working.
With companies and you should just be.
Independent if you are in the world cup.
Or you think you're going to qualify do.
Not signed in org.
Unless it says in the contract.
That they don't take any earnings from.
Tournaments and if you're in a contract.
That says that you need to get a lawyer.
And get out of that contract oh my god.
That's what he's doing.
Tv you did say though that he was.
Getting all his prize earnings i keep.
All my earnings yeah but why are other.
People mad at t few then they makes.
Enough sense if they take 80% that's.
Really bad he also says that he was.
Reportedly pushed into living in one of.
The group's la homes alongside other.
Young selim's nobody literally nobody.
Not a single soul t phew they forced me.
To live in a mansion for free how could.
They i mean he could have been.
Threatened or oh if you're not part of.
The thing then to be fair i we don't.
Know what's going on and he gets even.
Weirder he also says that he was.
Encouraged to drink alcohol while.
Underage tv was 20 years old at this.
Time shut the    up okay you're.
Drinking already people were very quick.
To point this out even in his own videos.
Yo what the there's snow up here yo guys.
I don't really drink but i am having.
Sounds what a drinker would say.
According to the ni a a a 60% of the you.
Admit to drinking at least one by the.
Time they're 18 years old now i would.
Never absolutely never encourage.
Underage people to drink but it's also.
You're full of bull whip crapper he also.
Said that he was continuously pressured.
To perform stunts in his video like why.
Is are they bringing this up in a legal.
Dispute it really seems like grasping.
For straws if you bring this up and face.
Bank one of the founders of faze.
Addresses as well    sicko jump off.
The    you've been doing that far far.
Far before you met us and the first.
Thing you did when you came to la the.
Very first thing you did was you brought.
Us all up to the reservoir and you.
Jumped off of the hollywood reservoir if.
Anyone was pressuring anybody into doing.
That it was you pressuring tommy his.
Brother gwit into doing it.
If you don't jump you got to jump with.
One of us huh got him.
Apparently face banks and tea fewer.
Friends and he got very upset about this.
Lawsuit seeing it as a big betrayal and.
I think that's why this whole story.
Really blew up so much and banks.
Addresses the whole 80 20 percent split.
Saying that absolutely 1000% untrue the.
Short answer is we have collected and.
Earned $60,000 from tfoo since we.
Originally started our relationship.
Which was about a year and a half ago.
Well that's obviously not 80 percent i.
Don't think that's 80% of what t foo.
Makes in a day so basically saying that.
Old faces done is collect sixty thousand.
From him which has been through brand.
Deals and in those brand deals they.
Haven't taken eighty percent they've.
Taken twenty percent we should still in.
The higher end but it's not that bad but.
I think the important distinction here.
Is that on t fuse contract it says that.
That they can take eighty percent it's.
Just the fact that they haven't done.
That but contractually i understand why.
He wants to get out of this contract it.
Sounds like a bogus contract if that's.
The case plus the fact that he seems.
Like he's exclusive with phase x well as.
Well he's obviously missing out on other.
Deals there and the fact that any deal.
He takes they will take 20% it's not.
That great of a deal sure 20% it's not.
Terrible but it's not great either.
Ajan this kid has made a gross amount of.
Money and we've collected a grand total.
Of $60,000 from him it is a good point.
Though what is he complaining if they're.
Not taking any money from him sounds.
Like a pretty good deal a lot of people.
Point out that by looking at the stats.
Of when t few joined this client to how.
That blew up his career here on april.
30th he joined phase and you can see.
Same month is when it really started.
Skyrocketing now obviously just looking.
At a stat and saying okay well he joined.
Here so therefore all his successes.
Thanks to face but banks even brought up.
A lot of example in his video of how.
Much they've done for this kid you're.
The captain i trust your judgment.
I trust your call i want you to have the.
Roster that you want but with that being.
Said please play with my homie t foo.
He's really    good just scream.
With him give him a chance and cloaks.
Response to that was something along the.
Lines of i know who he is we're not.
Interested turner knows how to get kills.
But he's not good at building we have.
This person this person this person this.
Person in mind he don't want to play.
With t foo again i pushed him yo just.
Play with him.
Just please scrim with him just give me.
That much that's all i asked and he did.
The rest is simply history they played.
Together and they crushed it they won.
Scream after scream and they were stoked.
Everyone was like this is really where t.
Foo started to really make his name.
Banks lists a lot of reasons why what he.
Did to help t few flustered man like.
Have this kid's name tattooed on my.
Leg like imagine how dumb i feel.
Right now.
So in the hollywood reporter we get some.
Word from t food more about his.
Perspective on the whole thing and what.
They say is that he's only gets to keep.
20% of the revenue from it from any.
Branded videos it seems so far that.
That's false missing out on.
Opportunities okay i understand and.
Apparently he attempted to terminate the.
Agreement claiming that faze clan.
Breached their deal but they rejected.
His decision and he's also seeking.
Punitive damages against face kline.
Apparently faze clan offered a.
Seven-figure bonus and taking 0% but.
They've been rejected i think the.
Emphasis here is on how they say.
Collected right and we've collected a.
Grand total of $60,000 from him we only.
Collect them 60,000 that might mean that.
They feel like they at any point.
I mean contractually at any point that.
Can say hey actually according to this.
Deal that we have you're signed for 8020.
We can take that money contractually.
They have every right to do that but it.
Seems like they had more of a trust.
Relationship in terms of me.
Renegotiating a contract when you're.
Already locked in it's not a good place.
To negotiate so i always understand.
Despite being offered a big deal why you.
Would cut this contract i think we're.
The reason why a lot of people are upset.
Is for all those dumb reasons that they.
Added along with this like the stunts.
And alcohol and also it seems from what.
We can tell the betrayal of a friendship.
But then again we don't really know too.
So i don't know t fuse law firm are.
Sending a message the time is now for.
Content creator gamers and streamers to.
Stop being taken advantage up through.
Oppressive unfair illegal agreements yah.
I mean the thing is i agree with this.
But it's all this is all done in the.
Completely wrong reasons most networks.
That exist right now most management.
Through youtube have completely fallen.
Apart because youtube finally made it so.
You don't have to depend on them when i.
Started i'm still salty about this.
Because when i started off there on.
Youtube i had no choice but to sign up.
With networks that were so lucrative.
They would give you actual illegal.
Contracts and they would take fifty.
Percent of your revenue because you it.
Was that or nothing.
Youtube would not monetize specific.
Creators especially gamers so he created.
This terrible relationship when networks.
Where they essentially just took your.
Money and you had no leverage to go.
Against it it was that or nothing if.
There's one message from all this is.
Don't sign anything unless you know.
Where you getting yours hundred percent.
Into too many people just read a.
Contract with their parents and they.
Sign aremy like oh we think we.
Understand get a lawyer to look after it.
I don't care how small of a youtuber you.
Are don't sign anything unless you're.
100% sure that you know what you're.
Getting into.
There's too many people still make this.
Mistake don't do it don't do it it's.
Harder to get out of a contract than it.
Is to get in one i've dealt with the.
Similar situations i understand tpu in a.
Sense but it also feels very fishy in.
The whole situation but it remains to.
See what he has to say we don't know.
What's been happening behind closed.
Doors could be more juice little more.
Tea perhaps.
What's up it's me am from the future tea.
Few has them now posted a response so.
Obviously we have to get through it.
Let's watch yo what is up guys i'm gonna.
Keep this via really short all the stuff.
About the gambling the stunts the.
Drinking i told my lawyer i did not want.
That in there and he will do exactly.
Just that he will take it out so that is.
It no worries no worries guys if he.
Didn't want that in.
I shouldn't have been in there okay your.
Lawyer represents you tea whew hey.
There's no way he put that in there.
Without your consent.
Everyone have said anybody i never want.
To bring that stuff in i never wanted to.
Get anybody to get emotional because.
This isn't about that this is about me.
In this contract this contract that i.
Signed when i didn't know any better i'm.
An idiot i should have never signed it.
In the first place.
What is in this contract is so bizarre i.
Wish you guys could see this thing.
Because i can't even fathom it yeah what.
Is in this contract is insane and that's.
Not even the worst parts and what i'm.
Trying to do here is just serve justice.
To the esports community the esports.
Industry these kids are getting ripped.
Off they're getting taken advantage of.
And i'm the first person to stand up and.
Say this is not right this is not cool.
And if only you guys could see what is.
In this contract release the contract.
Everybody.
Hashtag release contract release it.
Hashtag relieves the contract is out.
Everyone this response in my opinion not.
Good okay it's sort of acts as if in.
Good favor that we have to take his word.
For that the contract is so bad when.
People are already on the fence now i.
Personally don't doubt that it is bad.
I'm just saying if i had people.
Breathing down my neck.
I wouldn't go trust me guys it's really.
Bad and now banks is gonna release an.
Hour video responding to this if i was.
Teef you i would say i know all that i.
Know all the points about drinking and.
About doing the sun it was stupid and i.
Should never have brought it up but i.
Should be a testimony to just how.
Desperate i am to get out of this.
Contract even though face hasn't taken.
Collected as they say any money from me.
Now there's nothing legally in this.
Contract to stop them from doing so all.
This hard work and effort that i spent.
Over the past couple years i don't know.
How long he's been famous it could just.
Be completely stripped away because of.
This it's not right and yes i was an.
Idiot for signing this but this type of.
Good deals should not exist to begin.
With and they will continue to happen.
Unless unless someone there's something.
About him i mean he did kind of.
Formulate it in that sense.
I never meant to make this a personal i.
Never meant this to hurt anyone's.
Feelings.
But my livelihood is at stake here and i.
Need to fight for it i'm sorry to banks.
For hurting his feelings he's like a.
Brother to me and i'm appreciative of.
Everything he's done but i need to ask.
For one thing and that is for them to.
Release me from this contract if they.
Actually care about me the way they say.
I think that's the least i can do it's.
Not right and it's not fair and i'm.
Willing to drop everything if that just.
Goes through cuz that's his goal right.
He just want to be out of the contract i.
Would propose some sort of in-between.
Settlement the thing is this lawsuit is.
Bigger than just a dispute between.
Releasing the contract okay the labor.
Commission has been notified in.
California and they are now forced to.
Respond to this i don't know exactly how.
It works if they will have to launch.
Some sort of investigation but they're.
Basically saying that talent agencies.
Are supposed to be licensed and.
Regulated by the labor commission to.
Protect young talent from being suckered.
Into contracts like this they say that.
Esport teams have been operating as.
Unread regulated talent agencies for.
Years a direct violation of the talent.
Agency act most of these confiscated.
Streamers are very young and are often.
Unsophisticated on the season and.
Trusting as a result these young con the.
Creator streamers are susceptible to.
Being taken advantage of and exploited.
Often by those who are supposed to be.
Looking out for their best interests.
Unfortunately this has become an.
Industry standard they are fighting to.
Change the way these esport groups are.
Made or are functioning if the labor.
Commission is forced to respond then.
There could be major changes happening.
Here this is bigger than just the.
Contract people were even speculating.
That face might have to shut down.
Because of this that's why if they could.
Just come to some sort of conclusion.
I'll drop my charges you drop my your.
Contract i don't know like apparently t.
Fuse lawyers some sort of big shot he's.
Recognized a silenced california super.
Lawyer for 12 years.
If this gets dirty right if this gets.
Ugly teef you could be completely.
Screwed and the same way with face that.
The stakes are very very high here all.
Right.
Sit for next more ham next ham in an old.
Story that basically tati may not have.
Monetize her video but she's sure.
Monetized mine.
Patty apparently claimed ethan from a.
Tree's video this is so sad.
Tati also gave out a copyright strike to.
Another que channel that criticized her.
And it was all looking very very fishy.
Luckily she's removed the claims and.
Apologized and it seems that they were.
Made an error but why are people doing.
This automated claims to begin with stop.
Your stop apparently she has people.
Using footage of her without permission.
And that's why she activated this system.
The youtube system is already so goddamn.
Broken and just don't use it don't use.
Auto claims never use it also to free.
Star bonded to the james charles drama.
And it seemed like that was the end of.
The drama it's the dumbest video i've.
Probably seen in a very very long time.
Just basically goes oh i've been in a.
Dork please i accused james charles are.
Being a sexual predator with no evidence.
But you know i'm better than that so i'm.
Not gonna address any of the evidence.
For it because i'm better than that and.
Now i'm just like dark place we're all.
In a dark place and i was in a very dark.
Place where is his place they're going.
To the range but it seemed at least that.
It's finally solidified the end of the.
Totti james and geoffrey drama saga.
Thank god mixed news holly responds.
That's right what keemstar called the.
Side hoe of the whole pro jarrod.
Cheating situation finally came out and.
Made a response she made a very long.
Threat on twitter she called out pro.
Jarrod for making bad decisions about.
Exchanging nudes with fans she says that.
She she has seen relevant receipts which.
Prove that pro jarrod confirmed the.
Consent in ages of those individuals he.
Interacted with for those who don't know.
She also says that people that posted.
His nudes without consent it's called.
Revenge porn and is a felony in 48.
States as foolish as i think it is to.
Exchange nudes with fans.
And how bizarre that is and how much i.
Have disdained for that sort of thing.
Leaking these nudes is kind of up the.
Leg.
It's interesting how no one brings up.
That ethical aspect of it she calls out.
Heidi pro jared's ex-wife for being.
Abusive and having an abusive.
Relationship and she posted tweet.
Screenshots of that and sort of.
Threatening how embarrassing and how bad.
It would be for you pro jared if this.
All came out to light what she's.
Referring to exactly i don't know also.
Posting text messages about how she lied.
About not being poly and approving of.
The nudes now i'm not supposed to give.
My opinion but seeing all these texts.
And reading through this thread heidi.
Seems to me like a very aggressive.
Resentful and mean-spirited person if.
She got cheated on i do feel for her but.
It doesn't seem like it was the case i.
Love how holly posts like a lot of.
Evidence and improves in the text and.
Everyone's just like uh i think we need.
More proof to see like if these are real.
Texts.
No one asked that variety everyone was.
Completely on board from the beginning.
Oh she said he cheated oh well he must.
Have done it then now she's defending.
Herself and everyone's like all this.
Sudden hmm maybe it's fake i find it.
Very very interesting it's like.
Everyone's already made up their mind.
About this whole situation i think.
Though however i still stand by what my.
Take on it is that probably everyone.
Involved is responsible in more in one.
Way or another.
It remains to see pro jared's response i.
Would not be surprised if pro jared.
Makes a video showing evidence of what.
Has happened and what is more or less.
What went down.
Even if heidi was cheating on and was.
Treated poorly i don't think this public.
Persecution was it was okay the things.
That she said about holly.
This is mean and disgusting i'm curious.
To see what's gonna happen here cuz i.
Don't think it's over yet also i feel.
Like i should mention i've.
Met holly twice obviously i don't you.
Can never know truly about anyone i just.
Don't see her doing anything bad i can't.
Picture it.
Yes i've only met her twice extremely.
Briefly i just don't i don't see it i.
Just don't see it next news finally this.
Has been all over my reddit about a.
Copyright claim it's the top voted thing.
On my reddit it says all these 3,000.
Videos got claimed even though he had.
The music license to him yeah i've had a.
Bit of a strange situation to come on my.
Youtube channel.
This guy had as an outro or intro this.
Song that he do to the artists who made.
It got license for using so he had every.
Right according to this artist to use.
His song then all the sudden this this.
Company started claiming every single.
One of his videos.
She's obviously terrifying i can't.
Imagine that happening to me and he he.
Just says well i had the right to use.
These i'm gonna have to go through every.
Single one of these the whole system is.
Just completely broken and i agree.
That's ridiculous now the unfortunate.
Event of this is that even though he had.
Permission some samples in that song.
That artist i gave him permission didn't.
Have permission to use so ridiculous but.
That's the reality of copyright laws.
Youtube i know i i did see that youtube.
Was in touch with this guy hopefully.
They'll get it sorted out if it does and.
I'll be sure to report on it most likely.
What youtube can do is edit these videos.
And edit out the outro and then resubmit.
A claim and hopefully they'll get.
Released that's at least what i think is.
The easiest way to solve it it's just.
It's fun stuff that you have to deal.
With when you're a youtuber youtube it's.
The best thank you for watching another.
Episode of peer news it's been my.
Pleasure to be your host today papa.
