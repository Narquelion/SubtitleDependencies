I hate twitter i think about deleting.
Mine all the time what i don't like is.
That constant posturing that goes on.
There people just can't seem to help.
Themselves from pointing out what is.
Good and what is bad or how others are.
Bad and you are good to a point where it.
Almost becomes fiction just to satisfy.
This need and i don't mind that this.
Happens i understand that it does but.
What annoys me most about it is that it.
Gets rewarded through social media we.
Get likes we get engagement by boasting.
About certain things it's very popular.
A classic example could be jk rowling.
Changing the sexual identity.
Retroactively leon our characters as a.
Way to posture for social virtue points.
This to me is a good example because.
Most understand that it's complete.
But it's not always easy to.
Tell what is genuine online contrasting.
This using sports as an example.
Previously we have for thousands of.
Years rewarded the winners the people.
Who act the ones who run the fastest.
Swim the fastest score the most goals.
Etc etc we don't reward the ones who say.
They run the fastest but thanks to.
Social media this is someone become.
Backwards you get rewarded for saying.
Things that make you seem virtuous.
Rather than acting on it obviously this.
Is not nearly to the same extent but it.
Explains why the site has become such a.
Cesspool of opinion and how more often.
Than not the people who boast about.
Being virtuous often reveals to be.
Hiding the fact that through action they.
Are not i feel like there's so many.
Youtubers that could call out but what.
Is virtue then and what makes someone.
Actually virtuous well luckily this is.
Answered by ancient greek philosopher.
Aristotle according to aristotle the.
Path that leads to virtue is also the.
Path that leads to happiness or a happy.
Life i find it kind of humorous with the.
Neverending self-help books that exists.
That still tries to answer this question.
Today when it was answered over 2,000.
Years ago by the ancient greek word.
Eudaimonia what does this mean keep.
Watching we'll explore please watch.
First i just want to say i think it's so.
Cool the more i study ancient.
Greek philosophy the more i'm just.
Amazed by it first we had socrates one.
Of the arguably greatest philosophers of.
All time who taught using that word.
Loosely.
By the way plato my favorite philosopher.
An amazing writer and plato then created.
His famous school the academy which iris.
Tatl then enrolled in and aristotle has.
Been described as the great the one.
Philosopher i mean what a lineage but.
Wait it goes on aristotle also taught.
Alexander the    great i didn't.
Know this how insane is this the guy.
That took over the    world anyhow.
In the book nicomachean ethics by.
Aristotle it wasn't actually written by.
Aristotle it's notes taken down from his.
Lectures by his son nicky mcian some.
Argue this is the most important work of.
Philosophy ever written and in it we get.
The answer what is virtue according to.
Aristotle virtue is habit what this.
Means is that it can't be taught.
You can't teach someone how to be a good.
Person or how to act the right way.
Instead it's something that comes.
Through practice one good act doesn't.
Make you a virtuous person instead it's.
Something that you have to keep.
Practicing through action and through.
Habit can achieve after reading this i.
Find myself looking at my own upbringing.
And how habit has shaped who i am.
I never realized us how much of my whole.
Life and my whole being is based on.
Habit my moral my choices all of this if.
You strip down this idea of right action.
Through habit you could compare it to.
Machine learning or self taught ai which.
Actually works similar to how a human.
Brain functions and learns just in a.
Massively simplified way for example if.
A self-taught ai wants to learn how to.
Walk they need a motivating factor for.
That to happen it could be moving from.
Point a to b in the shortest amount of.
Time and that's the function that they.
Need to maximize when it learns it tries.
Different behaviors many times over and.
Over until it finds the most satisfying.
Path which achieves that function.
Basically developing habits of behavior.
To achieve their goal so then looking at.
As humans.
What is our motivating function what is.
It that drives us every day to get out.
Of bed and the answer according to.
Aristotle is happiness happiness is the.
Root function for all our actions if you.
Make an example out of this you could.
Say what if you want $100,000 what would.
You do with that amount if you say you.
Want to buy something materialistic like.
A car you can then ask again well why do.
You want a car you may answer oh to get.
From point a to point b.
Well why do you want to go from point a.
To point b you may answer to achieve a.
Certain goal and why do you want to.
Achieve a certain goal well.
Achieving goals makes you happy.
Similarly if you said well i want to.
Save my money because i hope in the.
Future that it will make you happy so.
Then if happiness is our function then.
Why aren't we all happy why is it so.
Difficult well it's complicated and.
Difficult to achieve.
Since virtue is achieved through action.
And habit helps us guide us through.
Those actions.
Iris tata points out that there's an.
Excess and efficiency to each of our.
Actions he describes this with a couple.
Different examples which i think is kind.
Of funny because his goal is to describe.
What makes someone virtuous but when i.
Read it it just made me think of how.
Many ways you can fail as a human if.
You're too scared of something then.
You're a coward but if you're too.
Fearless then you're overconfident.
Iris taught will put a lot of emphasis.
On communication if you get offended by.
Humor too much then that makes you.
Boring if you make too many jokes then.
You are seen as unserious if you're too.
Sad you're depressed if you are not sad.
Enough you might seem cold or unbothered.
About certain things he lists out many.
Of these examples on how to fail as a.
Human but he points out that between.
Each of these examples there lies the.
Golden mean no not the golden mean the.
Golden mean it's here that the virtuous.
Person acts each time and through habit.
Only can you find this mean in each.
Situation you find yourself in but he.
Also puts emphasis on the capacity of.
Each person some of us can only act.
Within a certain frame based on who we.
Are for example say you see a fire in a.
Building happen and you run in to save.
Someone which is seen as brave and.
Virtuous but if you're not strong enough.
To act on this you could get trapped in.
The house along with the person and then.
Causing more harm you should therefore.
Understand your capacity to act and then.
In instead call the fire department as a.
Way to help and through that way you act.
Virtuous within your own capacity this.
Leads us back to the word eudaimonia.
Which technically translates to.
Happiness and it's a state of well-being.
That you achieve by finding the golden.
Mean through right action and through.
Habit but what the word really means.
Isn't happiness it's more human.
Flourishing for many of us there exists.
A gap between what we perceive.
Selves being capable of and what we have.
Actually achieved and this gap creates.
Anxiety for us for some there might even.
Be the opposite situation where you are.
Able to achieve more but you just don't.
Recognize it yourself eudaimonia isn't.
There for being happy all the time that.
Would just be another extreme to the.
Mean but rather is acting virtuous.
Because you enjoy being virtuous and.
It's realizing your potential and acting.
Upon it that is the key to happiness.
That is the key to eudaimonia and that.
Is my summary of nicomachean ethics by.
The way    twitter.
