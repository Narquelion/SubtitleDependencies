How's it going bros my name is ohmygod.
Peered pie wreaked paid the price so.
Strong this has basically been all over.
Any form of social media oh my god ah.
It's basically being plastered on my.
Subreddit.
They even had to close send the.
Subreddit because people kept posting.
About it this isn't the why however but.
54,000 people want a workout review so.
That's what we're gonna do today i'm i.
Wasn't planning to talk about it or make.
A video like this in a long time at.
Least i don't know six months a year to.
For me to actually gain some muscle.
I'm not ripped okay i'm just lean or.
What there's a difference i i feel like.
I still have a long way to go but what.
Happened was i was putting up some light.
Outside i mean that was challenging.
Ceiling game as you can see my workout.
Routines hundred tambourine hits add a.
Hundred mics it came out and she was.
Like damn so she's not the photo of me.
And they should we both looked at it.
Like what the even i was shocked i had.
Any workout that day it's not like i was.
Pumped up or anything so she shared it.
On her social media because you know.
It's lame if i share it and goddamn.
People freaked out did not expect that i.
Guess since people always i've always.
Been very skinny for a very long time.
And people always see me that that's oh.
Do you gain any form of muscle it and.
People are like what yeah this is me.
Before yep oh yeah there it is i'm glad.
That photo exists and yeah this is me.
Now i guess at the end at the end of the.
Montage i need a couple more montages.
Come on i saw people online debating if.
I'm using roids or any sort of.
Supplement it's like i don't even know.
What they're talking about i don't know.
What it means i'm not that strong and.
Other people were just going like oh oh.
He's got a super-rich he's got like a.
Super good trainer pumping him every day.
And he's got like this insane gym at.
Home he can afford it so i thought why.
Don't i just start off by showing what.
My gym looks like welcome and here's my.
Gym set it eggar spots me thank you very.
Much.
So basically it's just as what is it.
Call finch it's garbage it's so bad it's.
So bulky i swear to god i feel like if i.
Ever die it's because this thing.
Collapses on me half the time the screws.
Are coming off and i have to keep.
Screwing them in so they ignite these.
Are super nifty and the way they work is.
That you can very quickly change each.
Weight that you want you want 30 40 60.
50 70 it goes up to 90 actually i have.
90 here that's why and even ten without.
Anything okay for 130 bam lifts up ready.
To go and that's why i have this risk.
Protection because it hits my wrists.
Sometimes and it hurts a lot so i got.
These i actually recommend it if you're.
Using these let me feel more badass.
Somehow i don't know why it does have a.
Problem which is that if i want to make.
A jump it's a high jump to go from 80 to.
90 pounds that's from from 36 kilos to.
41 instead of going from 36 kilos to.
Maybe.
38 or 39 it takes me a lot longer to.
Jump in in weight basically that's the.
Problem i have with these but it saves.
You a lot of money and a lot of space to.
Not have a whole rack with dumbbells.
Which would be nice i should probably.
Get that but these are cheaper i also.
Have these which are good for it's good.
For extra grip when you're doing pool.
Exercises they're okay they're not that.
Great it's just very frustrating.
Again i'm filming it is very frustrating.
When you're trying to hit away and you.
Know you can do it but you're losing.
Grip i hate that so much so these help.
And that's pretty much it.
I put my workout journal here next to.
All day all the chemicals so i write.
Down all the this is me day one i was.
Doing flat press 50-member soon cemani.
And then i could do it's not that bad.
Actually.
I haven't improved that much it's just i.
Hurt my arm recently so i haven't really.
I'm careful i'm careful what the show.
Here cuz sometimes i write down i get.
Angry and i write down about your show.
Do it.
So it's notes for me for the next week i.
Always go through what i did the.
Previous week so i'm like yeah next time.
Do this    you wimp.
Right arm weak very compared to left.
Yeah this is two weeks ago i hurt my arm.
This is probably dumbbells and don't.
Make the mistakes i made properly.
Warm-up make the right movements because.
If you get injured you're you're out for.
Three weeks at least it takes that long.
For the muscles to recover it it's very.
Easy to get damage with dumbbells i also.
Hurt my back from lifting down the.
Dumbbells which is equally important so.
If you're working out with dumbbells be.
Careful i'm saying it to myself in the.
Past it's not worth it to get injured.
Just take it slow but yeah i think it's.
Cool i like the idea that anyone can.
Pick up this with in their house it's.
Very small it doesn't take up a lot of.
Space and it's fairly cost efficient if.
You have if you don't have access to a.
Gym this is a pretty good space i would.
Say gym is always better because you're.
Gonna have machines and you're not gonna.
Hurt yourself like i do like a skinny.
Again that's my setup setup for i know.
My my setup is and i know i could get.
More but i just really like the idea.
That i can move it anywhere.
It feels very liberating to have that.
Kind of set up and you can do a ton with.
Dumbbells like i said in the video so.
Just be careful that's all.
So i've never actually spoken about my.
Workout history or whatever in 2016 i.
Had never been to a gym before in my.
Entire life and i i didn't know anything.
I don't know how to properly squat i.
Didn't know what reps meant i didn't.
Know what sets meant i but i wanted to.
Try and get in shape in better shape at.
Least so i kind of forced myself to go.
To a gym i i was terrified i had no idea.
What to expect and it was just the.
Overconfidence in me.
Just said i'll cage you just go in there.
And just how hard can it be you just put.
Up and down weights anyone can do that.
Don't be me basically what i'm saying if.
You've never been touching before ask a.
Friend to introduce you or or even.
Better and ask one of the personal.
Trainers at the gym they'll definitely.
Be one and they'll help you out i keep.
Seeing the sentiment that people that.
Are maybe overweight or don't feel.
Confident about their body or i feel.
Like they're gonna be judged or.
Something like that that you just.
Couldn't be further from a true and i.
Gotta say the personal trainers that i.
Worked with have just been the most.
Motivating and supportive people because.
That's their job you know it's so.
Definitely don't be scared to do that.
And to just get started a lot of gyms.
Will offer one personal trainer for free.
So it's a hundred percent worth it.
Absolutely you need to know what you're.
Doing going into a gym so i surely after.
I switched gyms and i got started with a.
Personal trainer which was really good.
He taught me to how to really push.
Myself how to workout with dumbbells.
Ironically this is me after going to the.
Gym you can tell there's some muscle.
Yeah okay maybe i don't know i think the.
Most strong i was at the time was in.
This video you can sorta tell there's.
Some muscle there but not a lot this was.
Really good the problem was that i.
Didn't have a goal with my exercise i.
Just sort of went with it which was a.
Big mistake and i knew you know at the.
Back of my mind i was working myself to.
The point where i was throwing up you.
Know i was really almost i wasn't.
Actually throwing up but when you feel.
Like oh god i cannot give any more which.
Is common when you start off and you.
Haven't worked out before but in the.
Back of my mind i was like there's no.
Way i can maintain this for a long time.
You know so lo and behold i got sick i.
Got a stomach flow that was really bad.
And they knocked me out for two to three.
Weeks and after that i just i just never.
Picked it up again and any sort of.
Progress that i've gained from from.
Those months at the gym after a year you.
Know i was still fit but it most of the.
Games were gone.
And so i decided to myself okay i'll.
Just set up a bench i'll set up some.
Dumb little side home and i can just.
Work out from that you know and this.
Time i'm not gonna make the same mistake.
I'm just gonna be consistent and i'm not.
Gonna overdo it so i did that for a year.
This really measly workout just to be.
Consistent because you know i've been.
Consistent on youtube and that sort of.
Been my success so that can translate.
Into exercise and yeah it just got to a.
Point where i was fed up and i i wanted.
To really start pushing myself and i did.
That two months ago and that's when i.
Really started to notice the big.
Difference that you've seen in the.
Photos today and this is after reading a.
Lot of books reading a lot of philosophy.
You guys know i'm a fan of mishima so if.
You know mishima that's pretty.
Self-explanatory for those who don't.
Know mishima was an author that was.
Absolutely ripped he talked a lot of my.
Body and action wishes a message today.
That seems completely lost and i read a.
Bunch of other books as well that helped.
Me develop my philosophy around exercise.
Which seems kind of cringy and and like.
It doesn't match no work at it that's.
For dummies which couldn't be further.
From the truth if anything body and soul.
Are are deeply connected and i wanted.
Them to match and that's why i really.
Wanted to start pushing myself with my.
Work ab so this time i had a clear goal.
What i was getting into so i just needed.
To push myself this time but how i.
Didn't have it i don't have a personal.
Trainer anymore so i sort of became my.
Own personal trainer i knew which.
Workout that was needed to be done i.
Just didn't know how to not slack off.
Because it's easier to slack off when.
You work out on your own it's totally.
Possible to to work out on your own but.
It's always better with a trainer or a.
Friend or with someone else so i started.
Tracking down my training i wrote down.
In a journal which you saw earlier my.
Reps my sights the weights and how much.
Rest time i would keep and i would.
Really try and push myself each time to.
Make sure i was making progress.
In retrospect i don't think that was the.
Most important thing to do their most.
Important thing is to really do it until.
You fail like you can't push any longer.
That should be the goal instead but it.
Worked out for me.
So my workout routine finally we got to.
It i'm sorry for so much talking.
So monday's i do push exercises i do.
Chest heavily on chest everyone keeps.
Making fun of my chest in the in the.
Photo but it looks better in person.
Trust me it's massive i got a huge tease.
And then i finish off with shoulders i.
Don't remember it in my head but it's.
Something like that and then tuesdays i.
Do leg squats deadlifts yada yada lunges.
And then wednesday i do pull exercises.
Then thursday i do leg a and leg again.
And then friday i finish with a mix of.
Push and pull i know there's other.
Variations of this sort of workout that.
Are more efficient and i'm probably.
Gonna change my workout pretty soon but.
It worked out for me so far i literally.
Just googled online like five day.
Dumbbell workout and you could probably.
Find it yourself and follow it so or.
Maybe i'll leave a link to an in.
Description if you want to try what i.
Did the most important thing is to.
Really push yourself until you fail but.
The next thing which is very important.
And people always say that it's.
Important but then they just ignore it.
Anyway but it is equally important.
Because when you're lifting weight.
You're only burning so many calories no.
Matter how heavy of an exercise you.
Don't really lose weight more in lifting.
Weights ironically you have to change.
Your diet if you want to lose body fat.
And the probably the biggest difference.
For me was cutting out alcohol which is.
Something i talked about before i'd say.
Maybe a year ago i quit alcohol for the.
First time yes you guys know i like my.
Whiskey too much i like my whiskey too.
Much which was not healthy i didn't feel.
Good about it so i quit alcohol.
Completely and i did that for a couple.
Months and i felt okay great you know i.
Can actually do this but then afterwards.
I just fell back into my old habits and.
I felt you can be and terrible about it.
Like i was slowly killing myself it's.
Great so i so i basically made the same.
Mistake i did with my workout as i did.
With my eating or drinking rather and.
There was obviously a lot of calories.
And drinking that's not the reason i.
Quit but it helps to have another reason.
To quit it i decided to just cut off.
Hard liquor from my palate i just.
Realized it's not for me if other people.
Like it that's great i just know i'm not.
Never again i do drink maybe like a pint.
Of beer once a week if i'm hanging out.
With friends online or whatever i drink.
Socially basically if someone saying hey.
As so as services and talk about how.
It's important to let your spirit loose.
And i kind of agree with that i was i.
Think the problem was before when i quit.
Drinking is that i was too strict on it.
I didn't want to be that person in the.
Friend group and i think this way i'm.
Just gonna be able to to stick with it.
And honestly quitting drinking it it was.
Hard it was a habit that i had develop.
And like you probably have some food or.
Some craving that you really feel.
Strongly about maybe you don't realize.
That you're addicted to it but once you.
Cut it out of your your diet that's when.
You realize that you are addicted to it.
And you sort of just like you trained.
Yourself to like that food and depend on.
That food you have to train yourself to.
Not be dependent on it and that's really.
Tough in the beginning but once you get.
Out of it you've gained a whole.
Different perspective and youie even me.
Looking back on my old drinking habits i.
Have really looked back on it with the.
Test and in the shame of my past self.
You have to realize that sensational.
Pleasures.
Don't bring happiness and as soon as you.
Take that first wipe it's already.
Fleeting it's not gonna make you happy.
Now i feel like there's almost a social.
Idea that you need food to be happy oh i.
Need these food because they make me.
Happy or whatever which isn't true.
Recently there was a comedian kumail.
Nanjiani who got really really ripped.
For marvel role this is really.
Impressive jesus christ those veins.
Breath and i saw he went on the kimmel.
Show and they had prepared this like.
Funny idea where okay so you reached.
Your goal now now we're gonna set you.
Off with a bunch of cakes and a bunch of.
Pizzas.
Yeah something special for you please go.
Ahead and be careful.
Music.
And i get it it's it's just a funny.
Thing but i also feel like this shows.
The to me at least the idea that oh you.
Like these sort of things are dependent.
For for becoming happy or it reinforces.
It at the very least it doesn't state it.
Necessarily gonna happen and i remember.
Very specifically the day we were like.
Is she gonna make it is she gonna make.
It and i remember when i got to the.
Hospital one of those days and went and.
She was up and sitting on her bed i'm.
Happier right now sorry this video just.
Became me ranting about different topics.
Hopefully it is helpful for people to.
Understand my mindset because i really.
Think mindset is one of the most.
Important things if you want to work out.
You can obviously anyone can pick up.
Working out for a little while but.
Unless you have the right mindset you're.
Not gonna be able to be consistently.
Pushing yourself for it one of the best.
Things i done out of all of these and.
And the change in my life that i'm the.
Most happy about is i looked up how much.
Protein i needed you can do this as well.
I'll link a little website down below so.
You can put in your weight you can put.
In your height and then you can put in.
How much you work out and then it tells.
You okay well this is roughly what your.
Daily protein intake should be and mine.
Was just way off so i started just.
Stuffing myself with a bunch of protein.
Snacks you know protein bars nuts that.
Have a lot of protein it's not as great.
But it's if you want something savory.
It's good.
This was life-changing for me because i.
Used to struggle a lot with anger i.
Never really i talked about actually my.
Sources and video about anger and i have.
Made the habit of being very angry often.
And very confrontational and aggressive.
At first i liked that part of myself.
Because i thought oh this is another.
Sort of image of a man kind of like.
Whisky is seen as manly you know it's.
It's society looks at anger a lot of.
Ways as something manly as well and i.
Think recognizing these things as just.
That and i started meditating on it a.
Lot.
I was able to control my anger much much.
Better so this doesn't really help with.
That as well but i would still you know.
Feel it i would still feel that anger.
Even though i didn't act on it the same.
Way i used to i will feel happy now with.
Virtuous by the fact that i wasn't.
Acting on my anger anymore but i wasn't.
My happy self that i would you normally.
Used to be and as much as i would like.
To at least but protein makes you self.
So much fuller and it doesn't make your.
At least for me my blood sugar spike is.
Much so if that problem for me which was.
A big problem just completely.
Disappeared just by me trying to eat.
More protein so i'm so happy i made that.
Change it wasn't intentional but it's.
Just something that just worked out.
Really well for me i guess last thing.
Working out will not solve all your.
Problems it will not fix any sort of.
Issues there's obviously many reasons to.
Work out that are very positive you you.
Will you'll look better you'll feel more.
Confident you'll be more healthy but.
These are obviously degenerate reasons.
To work out you exercise you extra lift.
Weights for mishima okay you lift.
Weights for homework you lift weights to.
Escape abstract concepts like time and.
Death that's the only acceptable reasons.
And just lastly if you feel good about.
Yourself already there's there's no.
Shape whatever size or shape you are i.
Don't care all right if you feel good.
About yourself all right great excellent.
This is not a video to make it like you.
Have to be like this or you have to have.
This mindset to be happy then this is.
Just something that worked for me and.
I'm very happy about it and it's been.
Really motivational as well to see so.
Many support around it i think that's.
Great.
And i really appreciate it i really feel.
Like jimbros are the most supportive.
People out there so yeah this is my.
Partner so far maybe in a year i'll make.
Another video when a more in depth on my.
Workout once i actually know how to do.
It properly i don't want to spread.
Misinformation and stuff like that but i.
I feel confident in what i said today at.
Least so there thanks for watching.
Brofist.
