Does he suck i think for me personally.
If someone's vocal just go on a date or.

Fine like if it's excess yeah a little.
Bit hard the smoking and drinking thing.
You know i wouldn't want to date someone.

Haven't really been public about it i.
Guess um okay i don't know who she's.
Gonna eliminate tyler he was talking.
About twerking oh yeah of course.
Of course but he also didn't seem like.
He was very serious about a relationship.
And then i'm gonna have to uh caleb no.
Particular reason just wasn't really.
Feeling it anymore i guess.
Damn that's me hair gel guys still in it.

Hopefully by like a boy and a girl to be.
Honest and then maybe like three or four.
Dogs so yeah with that oh yeah and i.
Want the boy to be a little older than.
The girl see i want it the other way.
Around believe the boy oh my god for me.
Something that's really important i'm.
Trying to become a pilot and i've joined.
The navy to try and achieve that goal.

Care i've got a lot so i'm a musician.
Actor but i'm also studying political.
Science and i want to be president of.
The night and you know being with.
Somebody that's like committed but also.
Like supportive and i can learn a lot.
From them that that really means a lot.
To me what about you i'm leaning towards.
Psychologists so i can help teens with.
Mental disorders and everything like.
That there's a lot of i think genuine.
Connection and you really like care.
About people you know because then you.
Can look beyond where they are and like.
See them for who they truly can't be and.
