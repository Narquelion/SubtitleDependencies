Another tlc episode today we're looking.
At and fisa and her relationship and oh.
Boy is it a good relationship built on.
Love trust caring for one another none.
Of that and fisa wants all of cortex.
Money and she's not even trying to hide.
It and it's goddamn beautiful let's.
Freakin do this so we started with.
George and anfisa going shopping for a.
Wedding okay.
When i told fisa i can't buy something.
She's not really good at compromising so.
To give context on this relationship he.
Has his own business.
Something marijuana related and he's.
Making a decent amount of money but i.
Know we're neared the expectations of.
What and fiza wants basically and she's.
Very upfront about the fact that i am.
Gonna be your wife for the money now.
This is a three carat ovum and just so.
You get an idea this ring is gonna be.
About $75,000.
Music.
Seventy-five thousand okay nice great.
Okay well there's there's ovals let's.
See something like this on your hands.
Round diamonds are probably the most.
Popular instead of going what actresses.
Once and what's most popular why don't.
You just pick a rink that you've got.
Them like okay what about bigger what do.
You think about when that's in the five.
Carat range just to see now that one's a.
Much more square shaped cushion so the.
Retail on this is three hundred thousand.
Three hundred thousand.
It should be legal to buy rinks that.
Expensive why i like it i like it now.
That i heard the price of it now i like.
It she's french we should be able to do.
This for 150 for you that's a pretty.
Good deal maybe you should him alright.
Okay that's a steal you want me to buy.
Something outrageous that's a steal i.
Save hundred and fifty over under fifty.
As soon as he said i even i was like.
Yeah sure saying three really quick i.
Think the ring shows how much he'll ask.
Me yes yes yes that's how that works.
Absolutely the ring and only the ring.
Will determine and actually not even the.
Ring just surprise of the ring if he.
Proposed to me with some cheap ring i.
Think i'm not gonna marry him i think.
I'm not gonna do it good good for him.
Then please for the love of god don't.
Marry this woman that's too much happy.
Wife happy life.
Is there a comfortable budget that we'd.
Like to sort of stay yeah they said 30.
Every what was it 15 or 30 i'm sure.
We've kind of had a budget from 35 to 45.
There you go fantastic you can find.
Beautiful things in that range you're.
Going to have to sacrifice a little bit.
In the color and the clarity basically.
Where you sacrifice is if you put like a.
Magnifying glass to the diamond then you.
Might not see a tiny little spot or not.
That's the difference in these things.
I know because i bought one i mean.
There's one thing about being reasonable.
And one thing going over budget and one.
Thing making me a slave for the rest of.
My life like a no reaction from her.
About that you want to be in crippling.
Debt for the rest of your life thanks to.
This woman unbelievable sir cannot.
Believe this but i can't get her a ring.
That's gonna take me 50 years to pay off.
I think we need some time to think maybe.
I will be able to make him get something.
More expensive george and i need to have.
A talk about yeah you do need to have a.
Talk about money jesus christ dig all.
Right let's keep watching now and if.
He's a kicks george out why oh my god.
This guy is it true see he's the epitome.
Of a symptom.
So first he got kicked out of bed.
Already masturbator then he got kicked.
Out of the freakin couch and the whole.
Apartment man had to sleep in the garage.
And you still want to marry this woman.
Enjoy the rest of your life i do want to.
Be in the same apartment with you after.
Our argument at the russian restaurant.
My head's been all over the place you're.
Basically saying they were just dating.
Me because i can buy you things i mean.
At least she's honest.
At least she's upfront about it what.
Goes through this man's head i cannot.
Understand it this is his first.
Girlfriend or something but i love her.
So much.
She's my soul mate she treats me like.
And once asked me for money i love her i.
Need to marry her that will fix it i.
Need to give away half of my assets to.
This woman that will fix the problem.
What i don't understand it it is hard.
Being with somebody that thrives on.
Conflict like that but i really want to.
Have a rational conversation to find out.
Where things stand.
Because i love anfisa why because you.
Got fake boobs and fake lips is that all.
It takes nothing i don't want nothing i.
Can't fix it you can't fix stupid.
She respects him in no way whatsoever.
It's so clear i don't know i think he.
Doesn't really realize that it's hard to.
Be in the foreign country where i don't.
Know anybody except oh which is why i.
Kicked him out of the flat i wanna throw.
It all from the window it wouldn't.
Surprise me going back to russia i mean.
Started packing my things good go back.

Back to my place and all my stuff is.
Packed and things i wants a postnup show.
Agreement why does she want it wouldn't.
She be better off so they got married.
Oh george she got married if i want to.
Be married to a liar why george was.
Supposed to tell me everything about him.
His finances but he doesn't and then he.
Asked me how am i not sure if i wanna.
Stay married to him that's exactly why.
The only thing i wanted on the agreement.
Is about the debt and that's all i know.
That's right that's the only thing you.
Care about because he's in depth thanks.
To you and now that you're married you.
Will technically all the same depp.
Doesn't it because you share all their.
Money yeah not gonna agree to anything.
Else it is unfair that he's trying to.
Put the stipulation in the past not.
Because i think i deserve more than 50%.
No matter what but then it spends my.
Money so what so what.
Mentally twelve-year-old jesus christ.
You yeah you deserve this you got into.
This mess the signs were all there they.
Were all there and you kept going for.
Whatever reason he decided to marry this.
Woman he yeah.
This is the worst person i just don't.
Think it's hair what you want well if.
You don't think it's it's fair then.
Let's be fair let's put on the post know.
That you're gonna buy me a 100 thousand.
Drink like a promise me she should.
Respect me that's more fair she makes a.
Good point with seeing how she's acting.
Towards all of this makes me realize.
That i need to be careful i'm not gonna.
Screw now because you you want to be.
Happy i'm agreeing to certain things to.
Know this what what the hell she's hit.
Him to know this jeez that was so out of.
Nowhere that's    up dude you should.
Call the cops for domestic violence at.
Least they got that on tape dude she's a.
Sociopath she's a psychopath we just.
Witness it so what don't smile at me.
Like that i'm telling you it's not me.
What huh i'm telling you that it's me.
What maybe let him finish his sentence.
This is in saying i never seen such a.
Psycho couple a i'm traumatized i'm.
Scared but also extremely entertaining i.
Can have a key yes you can have a key.
George was late.
We were late because of you he's not.
Very functional i always have to wait.
For him that's terrible.
I can't believe he's not punctual oh.
You're bad.
Attributes really they match up with not.
Being very punctual you're right it's.
Terrible i feel for you and please i.
Truly do we're going into this interview.
To show that we're in love and how but.
Good luck that the fight is a bad.
Example.
Zana that works yeah i guess you have to.
Prove that you're actually a couple yeah.
That would be tough he's driving so the.
Drug there's pretty nerve-racking.
Arguing about traffic and if we're gonna.
Be there on time oh nice nice verbal.
Abuse epic even though she jokes about.
It all the time on the back of my head.
I'm worried what happens after she gets.
It.
Well i'm gonna take a wild guess and.
She's gonna do exactly what you said.
He's such a simp if i never seen this.
Imp there's big it blows methods this is.
What happens yeah you're equally i mean.
Obviously the physical abuse really put.
It out out of the line but before that.
It's like you're playing right into it.
As well and all honestly i am in a.
Little day what death what he became in.
Depth after buying me all the things.
Well i got in depth for us being married.
Tell me oh that's kinda messed up if you.
Think that before they get there now it.
Makes sense to plug the thick heads okay.
Okay okay all right it's just some.
Accounts that i fell short on before.
Getting married with thank you sure now.
He's nice and sexy because i was.
Slacking.
You just haven't been honest with me i'm.
Telling you now you should've told me.
Before i've always been honest with you.
And you're always lied to me true she.
Has been honest i'll give him that.
Change and if you're not ready to adopt.
It i'm going to adapt what isn't it a.
Demidov - what - your lies that's stupid.
And irresponsible of him i do.
Loke she writes validity doesn't she.
The green card myself i'm entitled man.
It all makes sense they're a different.
Breed.
Bring your fiancee from abroad and.
Getting married when you're in depth.
When you don't have you together you.
Told me you have but you two love each.
Other i'm sure you can overcome this.
Little obstacle many families are in.
Depth in fact you'll work this out no.
Problem.
He'll be great yeah give me whatever.
Else i think i quash she's in wrong.
Order that's why she wanted the post nut.
Wasn't fair for george to wait until.
After i moved here to tell me that he.
Wasn't as rich as he told me before.
Business doesn't go all what you want me.
To do about how much money i have but i.
Spent everything i had trying to impress.
Her it's a pretty smart business move.
Right if you want to get a girlfriend.
Out of your lien take out a dent and buy.
Her all these things and what then once.
You're married you share the debt half.
The debts pretty good nice move for.
Pretty good childish oh my god he talks.
Like jontron its child oh my god is john.
Theurer sorry john i'm sorry but you.
Speak the same way this childish is your.
Ally.
So now that our future knows that i'm in.
Debt i'm worried that she's gonna leave.
Me or fill me more in debt.
Either way so i'm gonna be good no the.
First option pick the first option first.
Option please please pick that one.
This guy will never ever break up with.
Her no matter what he's so stuck does he.
Not have family that tells him i i watch.
The first episode with him and i know he.
Had sisters that were like thoughtful.
About him being like are you sure but.
They were still supported all right.
Couldn't they just tell him you need.
Someone to tell you cuz you're not.
Sometimes you get stuck in your brain.
And you don't make any sense.
With what you're doing and that's not.
Good i thought he was just trying to be.
Cheap and i didn't know that he's really.
In that he's been lying to me the entire.
Time and i feel like i can't trust him.
Anymore i mean to be fair lying about.
That that's pretty messed up but yeah i.
Think she takes her price on this one i.
Gotta say jesus all right we got more.
