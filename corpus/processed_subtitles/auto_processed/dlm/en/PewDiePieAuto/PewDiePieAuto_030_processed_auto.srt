Oh welcome everyone to q&a time with.
Pewdiepie for some reason you guys like.
These thank you god i hate these stories.
I don't care.
Stop posting them anyway i post them on.
Asking you guys to ask me questions so.
Let's go.
Obviously there are new sources that you.
Don't agree with or like but are there.
Any you actually recommend of course.
This may be controversial i think.
There's definitely a couple that are.
Good but i think there's an underlying.
Issue with most of them where it's as if.
Journalists jobs functions the same way.
As it is for youtubers where they're.
Paid for clicks on their articles so.
They're highly motivated to get more.
People to read their article and that.
Leads to a lot of clickbait it leads to.
A lot of hot takes and it makes me.
Wonder what happened to journalism when.
It used to be subscription-based so yeah.
They didn't have to rely on these.
Tactics that being said why did we as an.
Audience care about any of these sides.
Anyway just because they have a new.
Website we give it some sort of voice of.
Authority when in reality most people.
Don't seem to care anyway so i don't.
Know it's that it's like even sometimes.
When there's a hot take on a website.
That no one's heard about but you see.
That it's a news website so you're like.
Oh my god this is so stupid but in.
Reality is like it doesn't matter i.
Guess my point is i'm over it i don't.
Care no that's not true but i hope.
People will be as well what are your.
Future goals after youtube implying.
There's gonna be an after youtube do you.
Think youtube will exist let's say i.
Have a career until i'm 60 or 65 do you.
Think youtube in 30 years is still gonna.
Be the biggest platform for video.
Content it's not impossible but it.
Doesn't seem that likely that youtube is.
Just gonna be the top website forever.
And if i keep making videos for that.
Long time i don't i don't think it.
Matters i found on youtube or not on.
Youtube i think what matters more is if.
I still want to make videos at that.
Point which i don't know the answer to.
Where do you see yourself 20 years later.
Okay here's the question i don't know do.
You do anyone know that i think i just.
Realized who i am as a person and i am.
Very into the things i like to do i.
Right now i still really like to do.
Youtube but i also think i have a lot.
More to give.
Which.
Sounds very naive i just feel it myself.
That i am capable of more things than on.
What i'm doing and sometimes i'm worried.
That i'm trapped to make the same daily.
Kind of videos and not working on bigger.
Things and if i'm not sure if that is.
Holding me back or if that's something i.
Should just keep pursuing why are you.
Talking much about politics in the last.
Month i don't think i have have i how do.
You motivate yourself when you don't.
Want to do something but you have to get.
It done write down a list that's always.
The best thing whenever i think i'm.
Stuck and i know i have things to do and.
I'm procrastinating i always write it.
Down a bullet point list of the things.
That i need to get done today and that.
Way you can start chipping off the easy.
Bits and then you can get a clear.
Scheduling your head on how you're gonna.
Make that done make a video make a.
Thumbnail prep the video prep tomorrow's.
Video answering emails work out read go.
Home or practice japanese there you go.
That's what my day looks like which.
Youtuber was the most fun to collaborate.
With i think i have the most fun when i.
Record with jaken.
And ken because we are actual genuine.
Friends obviously it's really fun to go.
Outside and collaborate with random.
People it's the kind of thing where as a.
Youtuber you're benefited to network.
Right.
You're bennett it's beneficial to reach.
Out to people that you wouldn't normally.
Engage with just as a way to broaden.
Your scope of brandon and all that but i.
Find out to be very i don't like.
Networking i think it's dishonest and.
Tri hardy and gross in general what's.
Your actual net worth you've hinted it.
Being higher than google says and what.
Do you do with that money do you have.
Invested in stocks or bonds could you.
Give us a brief overview what you do.
With your money right now it's very.
Messy because i'm set up in sweden and.
Uk so i have like four or five companies.
I have some invested in stocks and bonds.
But i think overall i don't really spend.
It on anything personally because i.
Don't like having things around me i.
Find it very annoying i think media.
Likes to undervalue 8 me now after i.
Became more controversial like in the.
Forbes top list i know i'm higher than a.
Lot of other youtubers on that list but.
They always seem to put me lower now and.
That's why i'm saying like it is bigger.
But at the same time it doesn't matter.
Who cares it's so unimportant i don't.
Know i don't know what's important to me.
I don't it's not money it's really not i.
Think money for people is like an inch.
People want it because they don't know.
What it's like to experience it and then.
You have it and you're like actually i.
Feel the same way now when you retire.
From youtube would you consider founding.
A network something so other youtubers.
Can reach their dreams like you well.
Surprise i used to have a network with.
Disney called rebel blood and that was.
The idea i realized that there are so.
Many ways that i can create a company or.
Do all these things but i don't care.
It's boring i have the dream job right.
Making youtube videos is what i sign up.
To do because i want to do it for me to.
Go into other businesses would be a lot.
Of time commitment and very boring as.
I've learned it's extremely boring.
Compared to youtube you you have to want.
To if you want to pursue a business.
Separately and i've already made money.
So there's no incentive to be honest i.
Feel like a lot of times like a.
Hypocrite because i keep saying i don't.
Like care about money but i'm obviously.
Still generating a lot of money i'm.
Still selling merch.
I'm still putting mid rolls in my videos.
I'm still doing sponsors and it's like.
If i don't care about money why do i do.
These things in a way it feels like.
You're validating your work by making.
Money i know that maybe not makes sense.
At all then again the way you make.
Youtube videos and how successful you're.
Channeling is ties in to how you're.
Making money as well if your video makes.
A lot of money youtube is going to.
Recommend that video more as well does.
That make sense i hope in 2019 i can.
Start living by my own ideals more does.
That make sense.
What's something you wish youtube would.
Change anything you'd like to see come.
Back put me back in google preferred.
Youtube that reminds me actually i think.
That's why i got so caught up with i'm.
Looking i'm looking at myself now but i.
Can understand why i want to make more.
Money because of what happened in 29 at.
2017 2017 when the wall street journal.
Article came out my show was canceled i.
Was kicked out of google preferred.
Getting brian deals was so much harder.
You know they didn't want to touch me so.
I wanted to prove okay well you know i.
Don't need to work with big brands i.
Don't need to be a friendly friendly.
Brand to make it and to still earn the.
Same living so i have to be you know i.
Wanted to show that i could do that and.
That's why i worked myself into that you.
Know i got to work with a lot of cool.
Opportunities still like clutch is one.
Of those companies that were actually.
Loyal to me even though all that stuff.
Happened and i think that's that's.
Really cool and other brands as well.
That i'm really happy i can work with oh.
Yeah i think it's gotten to a point.
Where it might feels a bit much isn't it.
Why don't you collaborated videos with.
Markiplier anymore i think our content.
Swayed in different directions people.
Seem to think there's beef between us.
That's not it at all.
It's literally just i think we probably.
Have a mutual respect for each other but.
We don't have that kind of relationship.
Where we have to collaborate to maintain.
Anything i don't know it's like a if you.
Don't interact with someone online.
That means you hate each other that's.
How people perceive it online the way.
The audience perceives relationships and.
How it is in real life is completely.
Different from reality and i understand.
That's hard to understand maybe but it'd.
Be great if people aren't blowing all of.
It up for no reason okay.
What were the hardest and best moments.
Of your youtube career and now have you.
Always enjoy the content you make well.
I'll start with the first one i think.
Both for those things happen this year.
Best moment was obviously the wedding.
And i got to share that on youtube but.
Also some of the hard has happened this.
Year as well and it's mainly stuff that.
I've had to sort of dealt with behind.
The scenes a lot of things that just it.
Becomes more complicated if you dress it.
Online basically but that can also be.
Very frustrating because my whole the.
Whole way i've dealt with things on this.
Channel has been i talk about it i.
Address it and i get support from my.
Audience when i do it and that's the way.
For me to deal with a lot of hardship.
That comes with youtube and then.
Transfer have i always enjoy the content.
I make it goes up and down i think in.
General when i find myself not enjoying.
What i make that's when i tried.
Different things and based on you guys.
What you guys think of it i go in.
Different directions and that's the fun.
Of youtube i think that's why it's.
Always changing for me and i'm not doing.
The same things all the time.
How long do you plan on doing youtube.
I've been getting this question so much.
All the time because yeah i said i was.
Gonna go on a break and because things.
Are sort of wrapped up for me almost you.
Know i got married i hit 100 million you.
Know it would be a good time to just end.
It on the high and it's kind of annoying.
Almost how people keep asking like as if.
As if i should quit like when are you.
Quitting are you thinking about it maybe.
You should do it i love youtube and i.
Think i have more to give i know that's.
Kind of naive to say but i generally.
Think so and i sometimes i question.
Whether you know if it's possible for me.
To achieve more by the format i'm doing.
Now since i'm uploading every single day.
And if it has longevity in the sense of.
I don't really have days off right now.
This year has just been extremely busy.
It's been the busy year of my life and.
I've already had extremely busy years.
Before where i practically broke down so.
I hope i can find better balance for me.
To keep doing youtube if every year was.
Like it was this year then no i would.
Not do it for very long.
What makes you so interested in japan.
Culture or japan in general it's like.
People think you're a we've just because.
You like japan anyway it's like the.
Least thing that interests me about.
Japan obviously their culture is so rich.
And it's so different from the west and.
I think a lot of their values and and.
Way of interacting fits in with me as.
Well it's hard to just point at one.
Thing and say this is what i like when.
It's a lot a lot a lot of different.
Things do you still have the same.
Passion for making videos as you had 10.
Years ago had his reduced or increased i.
Would say it's is pretty much the same i.
Think there was more excitement because.
There was so much more growth in the.
Beginning and you go from from nothing.
To something big in a time but in.
General i still really like it because i.
Think i'm still pushing myself to do.
Different things i've been doing like.
This philosophy type of videos and more.
Of a different style that i'm not used.
To and that's beginning a lot of good.
Feedback so that makes me excited to try.
Out different things so i am how was.
Emergency i doing can you guys please.
Record another try not to cranes.
Challenge together you guys are a couple.
Girls a lot watching you both being in.
Love watching and love love laughing.
Together and bring us all a smile - is.
Doing great i think she did quit youtube.
To kind of leave youtube and she.
Definitely wouldn't mind being in a.
Video but i i don't really want to drag.
Her into that hemisphere.
And i understand once he left that you.
Don't want to be be back into it that's.
How i would feel at least if i left.
Youtube i wouldn't want to keep being.
Hey guys why don't you play horror games.
Again pewds i do play if there's a.
Horror game that's out that's.
Interesting i think i played as someone.
Amnesia mod recently and it was like the.
Worst performing video i've done in.
Forever so i know there's some people.
That want something but in general you.
Look at the bigger picture and it's like.
I'll do it from time to time if i feel.
Like it but in general it feels like.
Something i've already done once you.
Play enough horror games you understand.
The premise you understand the whole.
Thing and it becomes a bit redundant i i.
Do it mainly as a way for nostalgia at.
This point it's kind of like as if i.
Went back to play happy wheels all of a.
Sudden it's just merrily f for the sake.
Of nostalgia and it has no it has no.
Value in itself it's just repetition.
Which kind of bores me a little bit.
Serious question how does constant media.
Coverage both positive and negative.
Affect your well-being.
I imagine having your friends family.
Stumbling upon one of your the countless.
Articles written about oneself must be.
Taking a toll on anyone's mental half.
After so many years stay healthy.
Everyone mental well-being i don't think.
It affects me if it has they would have.
Done in the past it's something in.
General it's like you cross a line and.
It's like it doesn't matter you just.
Realize it doesn't matter i think in.
General they're just digging their own.
Grave at this point and it's just a.
Matter of time where there's gonna be a.
Whole new generation that don't believe.
In their credibility anymore do you see.
People taking photos in secret.
Yeah it happens all the time one of.
Polish youtubers said he took a photo of.
You when he was in uk because he didn't.
Want to disturb and i wonder if you see.
People do that and what do you think.
About it it's extremely cringy it.
Happened actually when i was in italy.
Now some guy did this and then the flash.
Went off and i'm just like really and.
Then they don't even go oh and the worst.
Part is afterwards they go up i'm like.
Hey can we do four i'm like you just.
Took a photo it's super cringy i hate.
The fact that people look at me like i'm.
Some sort of attraction i'm a person.
Like everyone else and i want to be.
Treated like a person i don't think.
That's too much to ask.
Hate the whole culture of i'm so tired.
Of it and that's why i said if you meet.
Me what you have to say is is math.
Related to science because that's how i.
Know if you're a cloud chaser or if you.
Or if you're a genuine 19 year old the.
Way people react what i found in.
Different countries is very different.
Right if you go to countries like.
Malaysia and singapore people are very.
Hectic and screamish and crazy and they.
Lose their mind if they see you and they.
Do all these crazy stuff and and then.
You look at countries like when i go.
Back to sweden people are more like me.
More reserved very polite and calm and.
Just and and more i would say a lot.
Nicer about it which i really really.
Appreciate so that makes me think the.
Whole way people react isn't just like a.
Natural reaction of being nervous it's.
Just like a trained reaction of okay so.
This is i'm so how i'm supposed to act.
If i see a famous person so me.
Complaining about it isn't like that i'm.
Fed up with it it's more like i want to.
Change it i love meeting fans don't get.
Me wrong but i also want people to just.
Treat me normally as well and i don't.
Like when people scream i don't like.
When people get freaked out and i.
Understand you get excited that's not.
What i'm talking against i think there.
Is like a culture to to treat people.
Like they are more than they are and.
That annoys me but to answer your.
Question take people taking fun in.
Secret yeah that's rude and annoying and.
It's cringe as hell because i can see it.
A lot of time happening where do you see.
Youtube in two years from now will they.
Actually listen to the community anymore.
Or will they turn entirely into an.
Advertiser flavor platform that doesn't.
Care about community i just demonize all.
Borderline content it seems that they.
Are making steps to improve towards edgy.
Content i've seen them do that with with.
Advertisers youtube does have to face.
With a lot of reality with the reality.
Of backlash that comes from the media.
That is inevitably going to affect their.
Advertisers that is a difficult position.
To be and to sort of look at the bigger.
Picture but then at the same time you.
Have a website that's for creators but.
The crater's needs advertisers.
I wonder if youtube just had the balls.
To just stand their ground how that.
Would affect it because they are they.
Are essentially a monopoly i will say i.
Think i it's obviously complicated and.
In a lot of ways i.
I understand youtube but at the same.
Time i think they made decisions in the.
Past that are so anti youtuber that i.
Wonder it's gonna take them a lot to.
Come back to a better point with the.
Community i think and i think if youtube.
Wants to have longevity even if they do.
Have monopoly they need to get that back.
Nothing is forever you know.
That they could easily become another.
Website in the future i don't see that.
As an impossibility at all you've taken.
Up many many other passions beside.
Youtube such as making video games what.
Would be another passion you would like.
To take up i think music could be fun to.
Work with i know that's the really.
Cliche that's like what a lot of.
Youtubers do but i think it could be a.
Fun medium for me to express a lot of.
Ideas and thoughts that it's hard to put.
Into words in a video i think music.
Could be an interesting medium to do.
That.
Will you make more philosophical videos.
Like that i hate twitter video yeah i.
Will definitely make more i have some.
Stuff i'm being then i sort of just let.
It simmer in the back of my mind.
Whenever i feel like thinking about.
Something so i just make it when it.
Comes natural light i try not to force.
It how do you deal with a lot of hate.
Alone well i think the important bit is.
To understand that everyone is a.
No i yeah sorry it's making me laugh.
Because it's it's i'm joking but it's.
Also true but only because you also have.
To be honest with yourself and see okay.
If someone says something then it's.
Making me feel a little uncomfortable.
Because maybe there's some truth in it.
Then i think it's important to address.
That and you said as constructive.
Criticism but i think once you get.
Something that is just purely stupid.
With no logic behind it or constructive.
Feedback behind it then yeah i treat.
Everyone like they're an idiot we should.
A lot of people art i swear in the.
Internet it's like the smartest and.
Dumbest thing ever i don't remember if i.
Answered it this way but if you could.
Change something this year what would.
Would you change if anything definitely.
Try and find a better balance between.
Work and time off what do you like so.
Much about japan that you are moving.
There is it being able to walk around in.
Public without getting recognized.
There's a lot of things that i like.
About japan it's definitely not only.
That but that's definitely a plus it's.
One of the few asian countries where i.
Can actually move around and.
Get recognized which is very liberating.
Because every time you meet someone they.
Just want something from you they want.
That picture if i can't draw the.
Distinction if they're a genuine fan and.
If they're just someone that thinks.
You're famous that's kind of.
Soul-crushing in a way where are the.
Kids felix oh boy.
So for years and years and years people.
Have been pressuring me and marcy to get.
Married and now we finally did and where.
Are the kids.
God it's so annoying i wish people.
Didn't ask to be honest because it.
Pressures it should be come from us and.
It shouldn't come from pray like i don't.
Want to be pressured about it it's like.
No stop it's like i say the smallest.
Thing like oh we're going i'm taking a.
Break and people like it's gonna make.
Baby or like i don't know if you had the.
Choice between amnesia and minecraft or.
What would you pick well minecraft.
Obviously do you think your content get.
Better or worse compared to let's say.
2017 do you think you try more or less.
When making a video compared to that.
Time i probably try more because the.
Videos kind of have to be a little.
Longer now so it does make it a little.
Bit more complicated before you can just.
Record like 10 minutes and cut it down.
To a five-minute video i think the main.
Thing i noticed with all the videos is.
The voice my voice is so different like.
How's it gone brad.
Hey how yeah it's just so cringy to me i.
Hope i finally find a voice that is.
Actually my voice open 21 i look back at.
Now and i don't cringe yeah i don't know.
Why you look depressed for real please.
Tell us why do i look depressed no i'm.
Not dony.
So weird i think mainly i'm just.
Frustrated i think so much happened this.
Year that i didn't take time to process.
And that's also part of reason of this.
Break i think how did you overcome video.
Awkwardness and what was your motivation.
When you started making videos that's.
Funny how you mentioned that cuz yeah it.
Was very awkward to make videos the.
First time you do it it's like a weird.
Thing to speak into a microphone or a.
Camera it's not normal it takes practice.
Just keep doing it and you'll get over.
It my motivation was to just create my.
Own path and find something that i liked.
I felt very trapped doing what something.
That i didn't enjoy.
I think i'm extremely fortunate to have.
Broken out of that the fact that i was.
Able to turn youtube into a.
Question was was my dream it's still is.
I'm so happy i can do a job that i.
Genuinely enjoy doing i think the only.
Thing like this to summarize this whole.
Video it's like i love making videos but.
Being at the precision i am it's way.
More than i bargained for i hope things.
Can just simmer down a little bit.
Simmer down and next year i can take.
Some time to fully process a lot of it.
As well and that's it for this q&a hope.
You guys enjoyed listening to me.
Rambling about.
