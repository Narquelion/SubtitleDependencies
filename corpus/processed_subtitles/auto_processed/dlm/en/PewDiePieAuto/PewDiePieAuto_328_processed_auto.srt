Music.
Pewdiepie here.
Master public speaker but it wasn't.
Always like this.
Oh no no i work my way there by doing a.
Bunch of public appearances so i thought.
Today.
Why don't we just watch them see how i.
Improved or gotten worse who knows.
I've done a lot more public uh media.
Stuff than i thought.
The very first thing i can remember was.
Appearing on swedish television.
We have two free channels in sweden i.
Think or is it three i don't know one.
And two and four i think are free.
All alright at least one and two i know.
Is run by the state that's like our.
Version of bbc.
It looks so awkward to film yourself.
Thank you.
I'm glad people feel like that.
Apparently not many people have found.
This.
Video keep it that way oh god so this is.
My very first appearance and i was so.
Excited about it.
It was like uh feeling like you finally.
Got recognized because i i thought i was.
Doing something really.
Unique for sweden at the time at least.
Oh god he's just playing video games.
All the time why is there a duck behind.
You huh what do you do all day.
Huh what's wrong with playing video.
Games why are you guys saying like that.
Who are you.
Joe rogan so let's go back to um.
I think was it there we go so you can.
Swear on swedish television.
That's great um the play delivery we.
Don't care.
Oh it doesn't even say me on the door.
Because i was renting that.
Flat second hand that that's how poor i.
Was i couldn't rent it directly or find.
One.
Just had to rent from someone else mean.
That's how poor i was i was still.
Renting so clearly i had money.
I don't know that's my family dog.
That's not even my dog and i was like.
She lives here.
That's a lie oh.
And this is the kitchen why do they make.
Me do this.
Producers they they want to make.
Stuff oh that's just.
Right there by the way i always talk.
About it there we go shut the google.
They.
Producers always they're the fault.
You're the fault you're the problem.
Because they're like all right so like.
Uh can we get a shot of you like walking.
In here and showing your kitchen.
Why why if this happened to me now i'd.
Be like no.
That's so weird oh they have something.
And that was my desk do you see you can.
Barely.
Fit a keyboard on this desk and it's in.
The living room.
That was my lightning oh my god.
Whoa see i could barely fit the.
Microphone on the desk i remember we.
Would keep falling down.
Um.
She's saying that uh old people.
Basically boomers.
Thinks pewdiepie has the weirdest job.
Oh my god do you see how clouded my.
Desktop is.
Oh that's disgusting well i'm glad i.
See how many tabs i have open bro cringe.
Bro look at this.
Clean clean sheesh cringe felix.
Damn that takes me back so much.
I don't know what software i'm using but.
I used that for years.
For i haven't seen her in so years.
I think that's the built-in one oh my.
God in windows this takes me back.
80 hours played amnesia based i don't.
Know.
It's so awkward when they're like oh.
Okay so now like film your videos.
And like we'll just be amaya.
It's so awkward when they always come in.
And they're like all right yeah now.
Now like do your thing and we're we're.
Just right behind you hovering above you.
It's like when you're trying to type.
Something on a computer and someone.
Comes up behind you and like what are.
You writing and i'm like.
Stop staring    i can't type if.
You're looking at me.
It doesn't work like that stop hovering.
And this was already a weird thing at.
The time like no one did let's plays or.
Like that so.
Um.
All right that's another thing that.
Media people do.
They want to get another thing of you so.
They ask you a question right.
She asked me how many people watch your.
Videos and i go 30 million.
Yes.
And i'm like all right right now i have.
30 million a month so they.
They don't respond to you they just.
Don't say anything because they want you.
To save something else.
Because we naturally fill the gap so.
She's purposely not saying anything so.
She can make it awkward for me i hate.
That.
See that.
Damn stupid media people in their stupid.
Media training all right so i thought we.
Would go to.
Samsung and see what they are doing over.
Here.
I want to continue somehow to be active.
For my fans.
Oh today i am.
But i think i'll do other projects in.
The future.
I guess i did it.
Maybe even bigger hey well i definitely.
Got bigger.
This is crazy i forgot about this.
Yes.
Oh that's right i wanted i wanted to.
Make my own horror video game.
But i never did i wanted to make video.
Games hey we made pewdiepie pixeling.
Still relevant downloaded goddammit.
I'm not really that interested in the.
Horror genre anymore but yeah i did have.
A lot of ideas for horror games.
And i always thought the horror genre.
After amnesia it got a bit.
Tired you know amnesia did it so well.
That it spawned a ton of clones.
Which was really fun for a while but.
After a while it sort of killed the.
Horror genre a bit.
I think because people weren't.
Innovating enough and i always thought.
That was so weird because.
Horror is such a genre where you can be.
Really creative with who knows.
Who knows who knows    it i can do it.
I have money reclaimed.
Internet program.
Nice one uh they're basically explaining.
How more money is going into the.
Internet.
Out of the pocket of all the media.
And this is back in 2012 so truth bumps.
How's it going bro my name is.
This guy was really nice he was like.
He's a talent and he speaks well in.
English.
So a lot of people can watch it and i.
Mean dad i love you.
It's not worth it it's not worth it.
Oh my god can you pick me up i can't.
Move.
No.
Laughter.
Why is this making me emotional i don't.
Know.
I don't know so much has changed so much.
I'm not sure what he's saying but it's.
It's he sounds smart.
Then they brought up some blogger and.
Then they showed me these posters.
Music.
So i did these posters where i told.
People hey i can write you can write.
Whatever you want on this and i'll write.
It for you.
Bad idea.
We saw a living room filled with posters.
We're not more self-observed now it's.
Just that more people are watching.
Again.
He's saying oh he's just playing video.
Games and talking over it.
That's crazy and then he says but that's.
Not what he does.
But he's making stand up in a way this.
Is a totally lame pewdiepie party but.
Okay i'll roll.
With it hey how you doing you come here.
Up then.
Laughter.
I forgot about this so i'm basically.
Saying you know how people always told.
You.
You'll never get anywhere by sitting in.
Front of the computer or your entire.
Life and here i was like.
But yeah i made it then.
Music.
But i proved them wrong all right so.
That was pretty much.
Bro bro bro.
So proud i'm so proud we made it bros.
We made it hell yeah didn't expect to be.
Uh so hard hitting the first time.
There's too much i i could make three.
Part series out of this.
This was another crazy one i did it was.
In 2012.
And it was uh in bilbao bilbao was a.
Really cool city i've never been there.
It's in spain.
I was speaking in front of audience who.
I don't think they spoke english that.
Well.
And i also don't think they really.
Understood what i did.
It was not a good speech can you even.
Hear me.
What happens in the future youtube is.
Revolutionary.
It's something stable you you knew it.
Youtube had potential.
Uh but something stable is funny i think.
Youtube been pretty.
Good at staying stable but you know.
Other social media platforms especially.
Seeing tick tock now getting banned or.
Whatever you never know what's gonna.
Happen with this new media.
So it always felt like a big gamble to.
Put all your cards into this.
Youtube thing it obviously was but it.
Paid off am i a trend.
Yeah i guess i wasn't.
Laughter.
And i talked about it wanting to make a.
Game as well look at me.
Going on stage dying of nervousness.
Wait what is this this is the red carpet.
Of ender's game.
So basically what they do on these i.
Didn't know this they have a guy that.
Goes before you and tells all the.
Paparazzis like.
This is pewdiepie he's he's important.
Because of this and this reason.
Take photos of him now but the.
Paparazzis have no.
Chill cause like if you're not important.
They they don't bother.
Like sympathy photos or something.
Because they they they told hey can we.
Do without my sand it's like why did i.
Why did i let that happen.
Big mistake should not have later go.
But i think martial didn't want to be in.
The spotlight anyway so i think it was.
Okay but.
Still yeah look at that yeah we're.
Together.
Beautiful she's beautiful how can you.
Not want to take photo of her.
All right this is another swedish one a.
Year later is this fun.
I can't tell it i like it it's fun for.
Me so shut up.
Music.
It's funny because i i still feel like.
That all the parents come up i'm sorry.
I don't know who you are i'm like it's.
Okay i don't care.
I'm so sorry i don't know why you don't.
Subscribe.
Well subscribe then.
Do is you upload short videos oh no no.
We got to get that watch time they're.
Long videos.
This is so lame finally we know what his.
Thoughts sound like.
He sounds softer in swedish yeah swedish.
Is kind of a.
Soft language isn't it what sort of to.
Me.
He sounds like a villager thank y'all.
Laughter.
Laughter.
It's so familiar yet unrecognizable whoa.
What the    is this.
Seven years ago whoa.
Hey green dress stop putting your hand.
In his face wait what.
Worst interviewer ever oh god what is.
This.
Have you picked up anything that you.
Like in the architecture when you look.
Out.
Oh i guess that side where the garden is.
That's really cool i don't know what it.
Is though.
It's trying to figure it out what it is.
It's a garden it's like oh it's the only.
Garden okay.
It's a garden i figured it was a garden.
But yeah and.
The blue thing is the sea you know oh.
Yeah it's beautiful i love it.
I always wanted to live next to the.
Season and then i did i moved to.
Brighton.
Oh god i have not had a bad meal here.
Yet let's just say that.
Very good now can you do a trademark.
Thing to a marina bay says just do.
Whatever your trademark is uh how's it.
Going marina bay science my name is.
Beautiful.
And i enjoyed staying there god wanted.
Cringe.
Hey nailed that handshake though nailed.
That handshake though.
Whoa singapore was insane can you.
Imagine going for my tiny little flat.
This is a year.
Before having like a couple thousand.
Subscribers.
To this environment where people are.
Screaming.
It was insane that was probably the most.
Insane experiences of my life.
A year later god damn i look handsome.
Here.
Look at this dude.
Applause.
Nailed that handshake nailed that.
Handshake felix well he damaged his hand.
That's why.
Thank you thank you you're welcome thank.
You.
Very nice to have you on the show uh you.
You.
Sorry about the norway thing it's just.
You weren't supposed to know about that.
Well we found it you know uh the thing.
Is that we.
We could speak swedish but out of.
Politeness we're speaking.
Look at my face be like good.
And you actually live here in england.
That's right yeah yeah so i'm actually i.
Moved to the uk at that time at this.
Point so it's all good.
What what we saw here now was it was.
That was clips excuse me of interviewers.
I understand why felix hates us.
Norwegians now this interview wasn't.
Enjoyable at all all those questions.
Were stupid.
Really it's from your youtube channel uh.
And.
And you must explain please explain you.
You play computer games.
Pretty much yeah any video game there is.
That is i like the stupid and silly.
Games.
That no one ever plays i like to find.
These.
Yeah that was my thing at the time like.
No one would ever play them because they.
Were so bad.
But then i'll i'll commentate over them.
And.
Make it into comedy somehow so so what.
You do.
You film yourself while you're playing.
Pretty much yeah.
I it's kind of a ridiculous thing i.
Just commentate while i play video games.
It's oh.
Almost like he said oh god i get it.
Like back in the day no one understood.
What it was and they would always ask.
And i never had a good answer i'm like i.
Play video games and then i talk over.
Them and i don't know what else to say.
So we're talking about marching here.
This might be interesting so i just had.
A couple followers.
One of our friends in italy she's from.
Italy uh.
She sent uh an email to her with.
My video in it saying look at this idiot.
Playing video games.
So apparently she liked that idiot but.
Music.
So much that she married him yeah.
You you you went not knowing her at all.
Yeah online yeah you say what you want.
About the interviewer but i'm not really.
Good here either like i'm not giving him.
Much to work on.
Keeping my questions very simple so.
I don't know you can tell i'm not really.
That good i was much more relaxed here.
Which was backstage afterwards i get.
Really tensed up when i get nervous and.
I think you can.
Help your fans and a good way to do that.
Is to.
Give them a name that's very common for.
Example i call my fans the bros.
So how would you call your fans well the.
Oldest the oldies.
With passion yeah i like yeah.
Tip number two there's a lot of um.
Technical aspects for example if you.
Encourage your fans to.
Like the video and subscribe you have to.
Tell them to do that that helps so.
Please like this video.
And subscribe yeah i think that's pretty.
Good.
See i'm much more natural it's almost.
Like i'm taking charge of this.
Thank you so much.
Oh that was close way oh i got.
War flashbacks just coming in out of.
Nowhere what that what.
Why would you do that in front of me i.
Misunderstood a handshake.
And good luck with the with your channel.
Yeah good luck with your channel too.
Thank you thank you subscribe subscribe.
See it's so much better felix is one.
Handsome guy yeah i look so much better.
Here they got.
Good makeup on me man look how i look.
Like now like a little.
Actual meatball with pubic hair on the.
Face what is this huh.
God damn time's changed man the years.
Have not been good on me man.
Uh next one i did was stephen colbert.
Welcome to television.
Which was so fun uh i didn't know who.
Colbert was.
So i felt like i was so much more.
Relaxed on this one because it wasn't it.
Didn't feel like a big deal people told.
Me like oh stephen colbert he's huge.
Like that's a big deal.
But i was like i think it worked in my.
Favor i never seen him so nervous and.
Uncomfortable well i guess it didn't.
Work in my favor.
Oh my god oh god i wish i could do this.
Now.
I wish you could do it now i feel like.
I've gotten so much better you know.
I want to do it again yeah i used to be.
So much more worried than.
Depends and nervous i still get but it's.
Way there i feel like it's way different.
Now.
Damn he looks nice he should start his.
Own minecraft series.
Why am i so wonderful i just made up a.
Bunch of words like flipping flopping.
And they would censor it the necker.
Worker would sense and be like god we.
Can't have them saying flip and flopping.
Oh god helvetta.
Oh that's good helmet that's funny.
Uh see that's a good like comedian.
Making.
Observations and she said yeah i got i.
Got a lot to learn man.
I can sense how awkward pewdiepie is.
Thank you guys thank you for your.
Encouragement of me trying to.
Be less introverted and weird in front.
Of people it really helps to have these.
Sort of comments in the back of my mind.
Next time i do a public appearance.
I really appreciate that he seems kind.
Of uncomfortable i think he's gotten.
More confident since then which is great.
I definitely have and i'm very happy.
About that.
It's weird i think ironically the reason.
Why i'm not on tv anymore is the reason.
Why i'm probably able to be more.
Comfortable on tv now because.
All the controversies i think that's.
What helped me uh.
Grow more less self-conscious about.
Myself i guess.
But yeah i wasn't conan as well and it's.
I it's just.
Pure cringe because i was such a huge.
Conan fan like.
Look how i'm sitting there it's like oh.
God.
What is happening are you nervous about.
Playing with me uh.
You know i think you should be nervous.
Yeah i've seen you play conan.
You're pretty pretty awful i'm terrible.
I can't get.
My play all right it's a little better i.
Love how defensive you guys are about me.
In the comments.
Pewdiepie cringing so hard at the first.
Person shooter games.
Hey first shooter games i can't get that.
My character to lift his head to see.
Where he's going yeah yeah.
I literally can't i have trouble and.
Then i.
Cringe cringe all right that's about as.
Much as i can.
Stomach that's as much as i can take but.
I gotta say.
Um youtube has given me such a weird.
Unique experience.
Of growing as a person that no other.
Environment.
In the world i think would have made me.
So i'm very thankful for.
Doing all these things that i was.
Terrified of doing as an introvert.
Especially.
It was i was dying inside anytime you.
Feel like you don't want to do something.
And you.
You go through with it at least me i.
Always feel like it's always worth it.
And it's good to remind yourself of that.
And you'll grow as a person for it.
Because next time you'll have that.
Experience in the back so push yourself.
In life because it will always be worth.
It if i had to force a little message at.
The end there.
That's it thank you for watching this.
Video thank you for subscribing and i.
See you guys.
Simp merch tomorrow hit up ah.
Children of nine parts.
It's time to raise what was once.
Forgotten.
What creatures fart spells and poop.
Troops awaits.
