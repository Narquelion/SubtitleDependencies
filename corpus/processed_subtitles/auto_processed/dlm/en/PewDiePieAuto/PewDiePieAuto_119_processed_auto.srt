Blaming you guys.
All right let's check out this couple i.
Love these.
Do you know daniel and muhammad yeah are.
They good.
Thumbs up all right might say proofs of.
Daniel and we have it.
He started kidding about me so that's.
What what made me uh.
More interested about him one of my.
Biggest concerns.
Was i had to build up the trust with him.
And then.
I was worried about the age difference.
Yeah.
I would that it i thought it was.
Someone's mom first oh god.
Me it's just a number it's just a number.
I didn't expect that someone from.
Another country.
Muhammad he's the only sane person on.
This show and that's what makes him.
Funny.
Why she's 41 but she looks.
55 all right.
This is early this must be one of the.
First couples.
He's from ohio okay danielle.
Yeah it's me my friend angie.
Is coming over last year we found out we.
Were going through.
Sort of the same situation she's married.
To a middle eastern man.
From egypt i want to know what's so.
Crazy about him come on this isn't.
Telling me anything.
So i'm gonna be completely honest okay.
I'm very very worried that you're um.
Welcome to florida gang he's got the.
Shirt scamming my mom.
He's scamming the mom jesus.
Christ the comments.
Someone need to be honest with her man.
Listen danielle you're old.
Unattractive if that weren't enough you.
Don't have much.
Too much of a personality either.
Why would a hot young guy travel across.
The ocean to be with an overnight.
Divorcee with two kids in iowa.
You got to have a couple months with.
That some tunisian arm candy and he got.
To come to the states transaction over.
Stop chasing after him like.
He broke your heart or something damn.
If he was truly here for the right.
Reasons to begin with he wasn't here.
Just for a green card.
Then it would still be a little bit of.
Compassion yeah and there's not.
So why are you chasing after him if he's.
Completely compassionate i have the.
Courtesy of saying i'm leaving.
He just walked up the door i really want.
To know what the hell did i do to make.
His life so bad.
Nothing you quit playing the game quit.
Letting him walk.
On you i don't think anybody's gonna.
Fault the fact that.
You know you didn't see the red flags or.
Didn't want to acknowledge the red flags.
Because you love the man.
I get it it's a tale of distorted.
Reality.
I understand now i mean told me that he.
Worked at a plastics.
Company so we're gonna have to go to the.
Pacific area town where.
The factories are is this it.
Yep this is it oh are they going to find.
Him.
God damn investigators man i don't even.
Know what to say so what's up.
Wait he's dating someone else i met.
Louise online.
She was very supportive and uh she's.
Always like.
He met a lot too making me feel good.
About stuff and give me.
Advice he never smiled like that with.
Danielle geez.
I wonder why tlc must be sponsoring.
Muhammad's visa for entertainment valley.
If i'm not with daniel of course i'm.
Gonna try to be with someone like luisa.
Because she has a good personality.
Right personality of course of course.
Yes personality.
The difference it makes all the.
Difference for you doesn't it muhammad.
She's always being there for me whenever.
I need her i just.
Why is it bothering me that he's.
Charging his phone outdoors you're a.
Restaurant what the    is wrong with.
You.
And you're the only person i can't trust.
No you are the only person i can trust.
I love you lisa i love you we go to.
Miami and we live happy forever.
And we have chargers in miami lisa.
Now after i left daniel i'm worried.
About my immigration status i don't know.
If i can't keep my green card or i'm i'm.
Gonna lose it.
Danielle made a lot of promises and she.
Said uh our life is gonna be great here.
All right let's hear it but.
It turned out to be all lies i cannot.
Take it anymore.
Hey hey how are you doing is that the.
Dad i recently left and uh i have been.
Staying with a friend and.
Okay yeah.
It's completely crazy what's going on my.
Name is tom.
Um i know mohammed i happen to meet him.
At walmart.
One day uh we just started talking.
Walmart bro.
Good friends since then danny they met.
At walmart.
And the rest is history we are.
Completely different.
The way that she's treating me it's like.
Not a husband she's treating me like.
More like a son.
Gee i wonder how that came to be huh.
Agents just the number h is just a.
Number she's treating me.
Like there's some crazy age difference i.
Don't get it.
Try to make things better but she never.
Did so i was asking myself.
Why do i have to be in that situation.
Am i going to spend all my life being.
Uncomfortable with someone.
Like daniel i gave i mean.
That's why you marry someone right to be.
With someone all your.
Life right remember when that's what.
Marriages meant.
Laughter.
Marriages they used to mean something.
Thank you tlc.
Came up to like almost everything in my.
Country.
My job my friends my family and.
Everything.
All right i understand that mohammed.
Took off.
Because he didn't like uh the mom.
And now she find him in miami so what's.
Going on.
Big follow hit him all the way to miami.
How far is that i gotta find this.
Oh it's not that far is it ah it's only.
22 hour drive that's whatever.
It's only a thousand five hundred miles.
All right let's see this he went down to.
Miami.
Really yeah and he put.
A pitcher out there where he's on a boat.
With louisa.
And her friend wow i'm here.
In sandusky trying to find my husband.
And he's off in miami on a boat with.
Another woman.
Partying it up muhammad always claimed.
He was just friends with.
Louisa but i believe that there's.
Something more going on with them.
She is a detective holy sh.
Oh my god it finally hit me danielle.
Looks like peter griffin.
Bruh come on guys he literally stuck.
Around for two to three years with a.
Lazy horrible woman.
He aren't that beast it's so weird to.
See who.
The comments are siding with danielle is.
So incredibly possessive.
I mean it is it was his her husband i.
Can.
To some extent understand but i just.
Don't know the full context as well i.
Don't think that looks like.
Friends he's still married and how's.
That gonna look he knows that his.
Immigration his visa is on the line.
Since he knows that you figured out that.
He scammed you.
I think in the beginning he did love me.
But then he started getting attention.
From.
Prettier better looking women.
That had more money i think he changed.
All right some self-reflection here some.
Character development.
That mohamed had sex with louisa.
Why would you ask that i'm still.
Yeah definitely here what the    do.
You think well let me make it very clear.
He's a.
Applause.
Let me make it clear did not expect her.
To say that in that tone.
Applause.
How did she do that well let me make it.
Very clear he's a.
I mean i don't know how else to say it.
Let me make it clear.
I just think that when she has to say it.
Out loud.
It makes it more real for her and that.
Makes it much more he's a man.
And let me make it clear what a friend.
Muhammad doesn't do.
Anything that's not going to benefit.
Muhammad muhammad doesn't care.
Who he hurts to get there who he steps.
On what lie he has to tell.
Or where he has to stick his penis he'll.
Do what he has to do to get what he.
Wants.
Stop you can stop him why why would you.
Do that.
Just break up with him i know a marriage.
Is a sacred thing but if you entered it.
On these circumstances then i don't.
Think it was that important to begin.
With danielle.
All right jesus christ dude let it.
Go.
God damn it but it's my husband yeah.
Okay he clearly married you for the visa.
So we're definitely gonna help each.
Other out you know i do have friends in.
Miami.
So you know they can help him are they.
Gonna get married jobs and stuff like.
That.
Let's actually go through the water what.
If you walk in this hand you're like.
This.
Because it's really heavy don't laugh at.
Me.
Right now i want to be with someone i.
Want to have.
Company yeah be okay be okay don't.
Don't mess with my hair the good thing.
Is.
There is no pressure.
And you're also the same age you look.
Fairly similar.
A major upgrade from that ohio board.
What the    is wrong with the comments.
Dude.
You're so mean he straight up pushed her.
Over wait what.
Oh hell yeah sure.
And he's not a yeah he did the thing.
Look at that i'm sorry.
No i'm sorry i am so sorry.
Muhammad and luisa face off no wait why.
What happened.
Okay we said we are not here for arguing.
Or anything so you don't even.
Call me or text me or anything anymore.
Like hey what's up.
Things is not going well so i'm just.
Trying to be quiet.
So you just like disappear that easy is.
That what you do with everybody.
Music.
Muhammad's love life could be a whole.
Tlc season how did you.
Come there for me you came by your own.
Will.
I didn't make you i didn't put a gun to.
Your head did i of course you didn't but.
You.
Encouraged me to come here and you said.
I have a lot of connections.
And i'm gonna help you to find jobs and.
All that stuff.
What made me come to miami yeah.
Someone who's like always tell me.
Something and doesn't happen.
It was like the same like danielle.
She disrespected me i just left not a.
Sip why did muhammad stop having sex.
With danielle geesh i wonder.
All right let's watch when we saw the.
Scene of you two at the wedding you said.
That you could not kiss her.
Yes okay what have you guys ever kissed.
Before that.
Yes you have yeah are you intimate.
Before that yes you have okay so you've.
Kind of consummated the relationship yes.
Was there any intimacy.
After the wedding at all after the well.
Yes.
There was but we started facing a.
Problem.
Yeah what is what was the problem i.
Don't want to say like this is very.
Private.
Instead of taking care of that problem.
She was like fighting with me over it.
This is something that.
No man in the world can accept that and.
Then.
And then she was crying screaming.
In front of her teenagers i want my sex.
Tonight.
If you don't give me my sex tonight i.
Will i will.
I will call the immigration i will get.
You deported.
He has told people that i smell and i do.
Eat on.
Okay this person here she has.
Some stuff that i don't like i i.
Complain.
You know what i don't even i don't even.
Want to know then.
Thank you very much thank you very much.
For if you're asking me.
Like why i'm not having sex with her.
Then you put it.
Out there i have to explain it you know.
Oh my god.
You know i thought he would have some.
Subtlety because he said it's very.
Private it seemed like he wasn't gonna.
Say anything.
And then he got to a point where she's.
Even saying i don't want to hear it.
Anymore.
Well it's so sad i can't believe it to.
Get him deported.
Music.
It's been months since i've seen him and.
I am starting to move on from him.
Oh if you want him deported i don't.
Think that you've moved on.
I'm pretty sure i'm going back to.
College and i'm looking for.
A nicer home for me and my daughters and.
I even have a new boyfriend.
Jesus christ that's an evil giggle.
I'm over muhammad but i stalk him all.
The time i'm starting to move on.
Picturing draw instead of throwing it.
Away.
Yeah right we're in a long-distance.
Relationship oh nice.
He lives like six hours away.
I'm moving on from muhammad but i want.
To show him.
He can't treat someone like this and.
Expect to get away i'm moving on yeah.
Yeah yeah okay all right i said.
I'm in miami he disappeared i've been.
Trying to track him down for a while.
And i finally found him he's gonna have.
A visitor soon and i'm finally gonna get.
Some payback.
Oh god they're all crazy it's a.
Beautiful thing i love it.
And i am damn sure he had sex after we.
Got married did you want to know the.
Last time i had sex with my husband.
Three months after we got married do you.
Think every guy in this world has sex.
With his wife every freaking day.
I highly doubt it to happen every day.
Well from the.
From the way is that muhammad's friend.
Sounds like it so where is he getting.
Sex from.
Nobody needs to know your sex life.
Either but you're freaking.
Talking about that because you think.
Muhammad's all innocent.
He's getting sex from someone he's.
Getting.
It from somewhere else if he's not.
Having it with his wife.
Not necessarily.
New england newlyweds are always.
Touching each other filling each other.
Making love with each other because.
They're in love.
I'm showing you evidence you know.
All the trips he's been on you're making.
Assumptions no.
Tom his actions speak louder.
Than his words i know your court.
Hearings this week.
Go in there prove it to the judge see.
What the judge has to say.
Yeah go yell out there get judged i mean.
What kind of.
Hope were you wanting from me.
I think we know who the villain is i.
Think we're figuring it out.
Whose side are you on.
Music.
Are you on muhammad oh my god she's.
Drawing the line in the sand.
I'm neutral i'm a i've tried to be.
Friends with both of you guys.
You're wasting energy that you could be.
Using.
To give to your daughters oh.
He's sitting here saying i don't take.
Care of my dog i never.
I never said you didn't take care of.
Your daughters i'm saying if you want.
To waste your energy is always into them.
Grabs yeah oh man he goes to my kids.
Grabs a giant pile of muhammad.
Never thought i would like tom more than.
Elderly dead legend.
Now that he knows how bad my financial.
Problems are i'm afraid he'll want to.
Leave to go back to tunisia.
Oh so wait what now you're worried that.
He's gonna wanna.
I thought you wanted to deport him.
Basically a sugar mama with no sugar.
Jesus you need to explain me everything.
So i can anderson are they back together.
Well you didn't tell me that you have.
Problems before i come here.
Or is this during before he left why.
Because i was scared that you would.
You wouldn't want me to go outside i.
Thought you wouldn't want me.
You knew the truth dude it's mean you're.
You're lying.
It's not about scared or not scared.
Oh so this is what happened during.
Everything there.
Why was this posted so much later family.
My friends everything.
Are we gonna be able to figure all this.
Out before your visa.
Yeah like even if i even if i moved to.
Someone.
And they had money and they turned out.
To have they'll not have money or.
Whatever i'm just saying hypothetically.
Right if i find out they don't have.
Money that's not as bad as i find out.
That they lied about it right.
That's the issue here and it seems like.
That's what muhammad thinks.
That we're not god she sounds such a.
Fake cried isn't she i'm worried.
You have to change a lot of things but.
I'm afraid.
Yeah if we don't figure this out that.
You're gonna leave.
So now we know his actions were.
Justified problems.
I will never leave because of the.
Problems or cause we don't have money.
I will live only if you keep doing.
Things by yourself.
And don't share it with people.
Because i have some bad news yeah this.
Is before the wedding.
And i'm more bad news more bad news are.
You serious.
Happy about it what is it.
What is it they haven't even gotten.
Married yet how was the english class.
Today.
It was okay muhammad.
And it was okay.
Today i've been hit with another big.
Problem what is it.
Tell me what the issue is can i just let.
You read this.
I lost my job.
Oh they let me go.
Why are you what's the reason.
Explain me more you did something wrong.
No i didn't do nothing wrong so how they.
Fired someone did.
Nothing wrong they felt that i'm not.
Good enough.
At the job but you wasn't serious.
About jobs that's why you lost it.
I can find another one i don't believe.
That.
What we're gonna do you are the only one.
Responsible for.
The money it feels like watching the.
Room i love it we lost.
Everything.
She hide things on me just because she's.
Worrying that i will leave and i feel.
Seem like.
It's impossible to change it i think.
That i'm wasting my time mohammed yes.
Paul dolce is that his lawyer nice to.
Meet you what a.
Guy he looks like anything from use what.
The.
I think if you're a lawyer it looks like.
Anything from you so it's decided to.

10 months a year it just depends.
But i don't i don't know why it takes so.
Long time.
Uh there's a lot of fraud he actually.
Seems like a good attorney.
