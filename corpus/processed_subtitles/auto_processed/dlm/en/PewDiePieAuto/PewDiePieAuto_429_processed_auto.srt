Fishing guys came by and ran into the.
Dive line whatever who cares right.

Doing well gamers he heard heard it here.
First.
Any time i do these kind of games.
There's always the backseat gamers i.
Just can't handle it why did he know.
Looking surprising pretty much what.
You'd expect bradshaw was insane it was.
Like traveling through time no.
Well it was like traveling through time.
And accidentally ending up in a.
Dimension where the past is underwater.
And like everything particles and sharks.
Sharks excuse me julia.
I'm gonna need you to stop smiling i.
Can't keep playing if this goes on i'm.
Sorry to pause but my brief hey i.
Thought it was pretty intense wasn't.

After he helped flis maybe he decided.
Hey i'll drink some and then he got.
Drunk and since he was drunk he forgot.
To bring it to us.
And he just kept on drinking and he.
Drank all of it sounds like you've had.
Some experience with this kind of.
Phenomenon yeah i've been studying it.
For you i'll go look for him oh yeah.
Bracelet lodged in the plane huh i left.
It below deck if you want to check it.

Weird.
Music.
Ok gamers they've been visiting the.
Frick chamber julia haha oh my god.

Figure out why the plane was out here.
Where'd you put it.
It's in your case okay i'll go get it.
Hey thanks julian.
Oh i guess i have to play as julia now.
Let's check here first.
Oh yeah because we can look at the.
Photos yeah that was fun is this.
Supposed to be a gopro 30 meter.
Waterproof wow i can look at it here we.
Go wow wow that's a pretty good camera.
For low light and rescue service condon.
I love pondering on selfie it's me after.
Making videos alright i think that's it.
Cool man.
I remember playing these type of games.
When i was kid obviously very different.
Because these this genre didn't exist.
But like i didn't mean to click on this.
By the way just so we're clear i got the.
Patty yeah thank you.
Laurie's let's go get it oh so he helps.
Us if you wait that's interesting i.
Wonder if that changes things just just.
Looking how much games has improved over.
Yonder graphics is pretty it's cool to.
Be playing the games that really push.
The forefront on that come here fix it.
Easy tiger we should get back i remember.
Playing this game called egypt there's.
Something like that and i remember.
Looking at the grasses i'm like dude.
That looks so epic i'm kind of curious.
How that looks like now you'll get no.
Resistance there all right everyone.
Check it out manchurian gold who wants.
To find some sunken treasure so what do.
You think adam coordinates those are.
Coordinates all right maybe the planes.
Destination you think we could get there.
By tomorrow it takes a couple hours if.
The weather stays steady but you know.
It's gonna come there there was a flight.
Plan on board that seemed to indicate it.
Was a rescue plane yeah that makes sense.
After the war they turned long-range.
Bombers into rescue planes and then this.
Plane must have been shot down cuz it.
Was riddled with bullet holes.
I found one lodged in the fuselage huh.
And it was full of life rafts and stuff.
Gotten shot down before they could.
Deliver all the rafts there was only one.
Missing reckless all of you.
Why use me i told you to leave.
Everything down there alone oh come on.
We've been through this already i'm not.
Lying i love no hey oh we're respectful.
No you did whatever you wanted whatever.
You took it was too much we took a.
Bullet okay listen you need a chill in.
That brick out oh come on no one knows.
We've even been down there and i don't.
Think ghosts can talk you americans are.
All the same huh no respect for anyone.
Else's traditions i should have never.
Gone down to that claim in the first.
Place it's bad luck what is this one a.
Down there and it makes no.
Difference but every single thing you.
Bring back has an essence it's like a.
Ghost you invite to the surface there we.
Go.
Hi.
I never thought about it like that you.
Never think about much of anything well.
Maybe i never heard about such cool.
Ghost stories they're not cool ghost.
Stories not like for fun people drown in.
These waters and you have to respect our.
Resting place damn straight.
Bread you got a fun ghost story right.
Sure but you know nothing like what flis.
Is talking about.
Come on tell the ghost so retail ls the.
Deo support and less here let's hear it.
I want to guess you can spin a good yarn.
It's kind of messed up actually scare.
Away little bro yeah here goes.
This story is true it had happened to.
Right near here in an old lighthouse.
That's how you said a good boy yeah true.
Story.
Where'd you hear this ah well down by.
The dockside i found an ancient here's.
Here by the way skin like a leather book.
Eyepatch wooden leg the whole nine yards.
And for a dollar he told me his secrets.
Okay here we go.
A lighthouse mister the top and a toll.
Isolated from the rest of the world of.
Lone beacon in the night a sailor's.
Respite the lighthouse keeper would hear.
The waves pounding the rocky shore one.
Misty morning he comes upon a woman.
Covered in blood she's stumbling down.
The beach he hurries to her aid and she.
Falls into his arms sobbing as he.
Hurries her back to the lighthouse he.
Asks where she's from he doesn't waste.
Any time it's smooth i respect it i.
Definitely recognize him shush ah woman.
Answers i live here in the lighthouse.
My parents are upstairs right now twists.
Of course the lighthouse keeper says.
That isn't so of course he's lived there.
Alone for years and the woman becomes.
Hysterical and it's just her parents are.
Upstairs so they go to the top of the.
Lighthouse and they're splayed out on.
The floor is a man and a woman brutally.
Murdered with an axe always an axe i.
Mean do people even use exes anymore yes.
Yes they dance cliches and all chopped.
Up into little tiny giblets have an axe.
Just like we're skolnick oh.
That's amping you know sometimes you.
Have to embellish the facts a little to.
Get at the deeper truth it's okay.
Okay so who did it.
The woman says he was my husband and she.
Turns to the closet it says he's in.
There is the husband and that's why i've.
Always been a little weary of marriage.
So the lighthouse keeper or shadow a.
Closet opens the door and sure enough.
There's a man inside but he's cut his.
Own throat.
Horrified he was closer to see the dead.
Man's face in the dark closer closer and.
He sees it's his own face and then its.
Eyes bulge out and screams whoa what's.
Wrong with you super twins nice super.
Twist.
Nice one squire i wasn't scared oh come.

A light just channeled a maybe french.
People not so bad after all.
Yeah that was so worth.
No problem gamers.
The hell is this    place dude even.
Those meatheads seem spooked yeah you.
Think this ship is the material gold we.
Are in the vicinity of those coordinates.
Thanks boats never move over either so.
That makes sense we can't just sit.
Around need a plan we're not exactly in.
The best position to be making any moves.
Second they let their guard down we got.
To take advantage of it and get off the.
Ship yeah and get the bone and bling.
Blang blang yeah man this whole rust.
Buckets one tetanus shot from the bottom.
Of the oh yes we tried to escape didn't.
Exactly work out we gotta get back to.
The boat and find brad what happened to.
Him no idea they swiped our distributor.
Cap gonna be difficult to get anywhere.
Without it.
So can't we just like hotwire or.
Something.
Oh so we can't even wire distributor cap.
As    knew exactly what they were.
Doing while those guys are out panning.
From entering gold or whatever they.
Think they're gonna find on this.
Floating coffin we got to take advantage.
And look around for a way out of here.
Easy easy.
Alright maybe we can find a painting.
That we have what happened here maybe.
With the man carrying gold they're.
Referring to that it's something else.
Right see i'm smart i'm big.
Maybe not something maybe they my.
Carrying all this leavin something real.
You only yeah there's next to you come.

Hope we don't run across any ghosts got.
Our hands full already.
Okay we got one guy complaining about.
Another guy pretending to be sick so he.
Could get out of guarding one of the.
Holes yeah i guess he was kind of a.
Repeat offender.
It sounds like nobody liked it very much.
Down there so i guess the moral of the.
Story is stay the    away from the.
Haunted cardinals haunted maybe they.
Just didn't like working there yeah or.
Maybe there are super ghosts probably.
Super ghosts that's what super ghosts.
Ghosts but like 16min it's not a.

Meatballs are probably just paying for.
Some donors or meanwhile i said.
Derogatory she may not even exist i mean.
What if they don't find anything then.
We're    so what do we do way i see.
