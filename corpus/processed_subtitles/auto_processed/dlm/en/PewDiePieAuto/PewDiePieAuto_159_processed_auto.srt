With magic tricks.
I never done magic tricks before but i.
Am set.
On absolutely making my wife go everyone.
Loves a good magic trick.
It's the best and in this video i will.
Reveal.
All the tricks that i've done but first.
I have to learn how to do the tricks.
The first trick is drop out brass this.
Is what i got this is what.
Was in the box is by mr magic.
And it came with instructions uh it's.
Made in.
India as you can see a plastic mold.
Black ass bottle.
Has a hole a steel ball in hole the ball.
Never out by the.
Performer if it down the ball never out.
By the performer if it down.
The ball never out by the performer if.
It down.
Secret at that time down of the mold.
Steel ball comes inside index finger.
When it opens guidance it becomes side.
Of the ball i'm even correcting it as.
I'm reading it.
What does this mean i spent 20 dollars.
On this.
After a few numbers of show performers.
Hand over audience to lock the ball.
But they never but they never this is.
Gonna be disaster i know.
It they know how how do i do this.
Trick.
This does not twist so i looked online.
There's one made by viking.
Here is small depression on the side.
Okay.
It's called gravity yeah thanks a lot.
There's something strange if there's.
Ringing down watch happens.
I don't have a ring does it matter.
Yeah you've already shown the tricks.
Show me how to do it.
Why is it it must be magic all right.
Explain it then.
They don't explain it they don't explain.
The trick i'm screwed.
I don't maybe i can figure it out i have.
A big brain right do you press.
Is that it no this literally does not.
Move.
When uh it opens the guidance it becomes.
It comes upside the ball what does that.
Mean.
Thanks india 10 bucks for this garbage.
No skill required    you.
You not even the comments can figure out.
Cool let's move on to the next trick.
That was awesome thank you.
Next trick is even more awesome look at.
This.
We have the moon where is.
It.
There it is i'll explain this trick.
After because it's so difficult.
I can't wait to show this one to marzia.
It also comes with the.
Instructions made in india very nice the.
Audience will not be impressed.
That doesn't sound good the audience.
Will howl for the doors to be open.
Wow can't wait for that to happen all.
Right let's perform this one.
The third magic trick is bingo that's.
Right.
I'm supposed to do this trick where i.
Predict what martial put.
It's the dumbest trick probably i've.
Ever seen and i i don't even need to.
Look up the instructions because it's so.
Stupid.
But let's do it fourth trick i think.
This one is gonna wow her.
All right this one is a bunch of poker.
Chips and i'm gonna guess.
Which one marcia picks.
Basically it might be cool i think this.
One is probably the best one.
If this doesn't wow her uh we're out.
We're outside.
All right the final trick i'm supposed.
To lock one of the cards.
Inside this device right the problem is.
This is too.
Big it's supposed to fit a case.
Of cards i got like the shitty cards and.
They don't fit.
So i'm just gonna i'm just gonna have to.
Wing this one but hopefully.
I it will wow marzia and the final item.
Is magic lighter where i'm supposed to.
Be able to.
Lit it with my mind which i can alright.
Let's see how it goes.
Are you ready for the greatest magic.
Show of all time sure.
Yeah trick number one because i actually.
Strict number two because i failed the.
First one.
If you don't howl during this magic.
