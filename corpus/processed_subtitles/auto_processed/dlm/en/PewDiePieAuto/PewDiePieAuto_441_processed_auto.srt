What is my most controversial video fish.
Lasagna bridge ah ah nope.
It's why i don't like marvel movies.
Let's let's look at this video this is.
The worst dislike ratio i have on any.
But not least an infinitely more.
Apparently a big deal of the movies that.
A lot of superheroes die but i'm not.
Gonna spoiler which once or anything.
Like that but let's just entertain the.
Idea that lets say i remind dies let's.
Say iron man dies from oliver write that.
Down.
How good yeah i like how my main.
Criticism of the marvel filmed was that.
No one actually dies i was proven wrong.
To be honest i never watched endgame or.
Any of the last films and and when i.
Flew recently from japan to uk my.
Computer were in charge i had no choice.
But to watch what was offered and it was.
All avengers of course and which is one.
Of the reasons i didn't like marvel.
Because it's literally everywhere.
Ironically but i watched it and i.
Actually enjoyed it for the first time.
Please don't dislike this video.
I love marvel ok this is not the point.
And i realized the reason why i liked it.
So much was because i finally like one.
Of its heroes thanos.
That's right thanos is epic and also.
Very sexy i realize that there's already.
A hundred videos at least about the.
Philosophy of banias and why was stannis.
Right hmm appalachian pete well i would.
Argue that thanos was actually better.
Than all of us here's why well first of.
All what stan is right to understand.
That you must understand what is right.
If you have glasses on now what is right.
Think about it why it's such a smug.
Question don't think too hard this is.
Not i'm 14 and this is d i'm waiting.
Right is in most senses and you could.
Call an ethical system to bring wellness.
To something a community or yourself and.
Sometimes making the right choice will.
Lead to unethical actions like say.
Wiping off half the universe the.
Philosopher sren kierkegaard who i've.
Spoken about before on my channel calls.
This concept in the book of fear and.
Trembling the theological suspension of.
The ethical tlo's means goal in in greek.
And it's basically means putting aside.
What is right or what is technically.
Good to do in hope for something greater.
If you buy g fuel enter code pity pi to.
Become ethically energized and and.
Thirst quench you made a theological.
Decision thanos believed that wiping out.
Half the universe would be would make it.
So that life would actually be able to.
Continue and thrive and become better.
And did not just cease to exist i think.
That's the consensus i don't really.
Remember this universe.
I annoyed its resources finite his life.
Is left unchecked life who ceased to.
Exist it needs you don't know that i'm.
The only one who knows that but his goal.
Is for things to turn out well and he.
Doesn't take pleasure in the killing.
Which i think is an important.
Distinction of him being good or right.
Music.
And that's the important distinction of.
Why he's likable he's a tragic hero.
This makes tanis what sren kierkegaard.
Would call a night of infinite.
Resignation and so what is that then.
Well kierkegaard defined life in three.
Different stages and i spoken about this.
In my channel before but the first one.
Where most of us is is in the aesthetic.
We're sort of trapped here we're.
Focusing purely on our senses we try and.
Maximize we try and maximize them as.
Much as possible to feel as good as.
Possible.
We don't live for one single thinking.
But many many different things and i.
Think most people can relate to that we.
Think these choices based on what will.
Make us happy so how do you get out of.
The aesthetic well you move on to the.
Ethical and to put it very simple it's.
Basically living for others or another.
Purpose beyond your senses and it's here.
Where the night of internet resignation.
Can exist just because it's called a.
Night doesn't mean it has to be a man it.
Could be any but i also believe.
Character garda calls it a night to.
Symbolize someone very strong and.
Chivalrous and tough you would have to.
Be to make these sort of decisions that.
A knight of infinite resignation has to.
Make when character god talks about the.
Infinite he's talking about what you.
Love and that is what defines your.
Entire worldview it quote from the book.
Is so for the first thing the night will.
Have power to concentrate the whole.
Content of life and the whole.
Significance of reality in one single.
Wish the night of infinite resignation.
Resigns just that everything for this.
Wish and diana's did this he put he put.
Everything aside to reach this goal to.
Reach this wish a hero is typically.
Defined by what they love.
What do you love have you ever made a.
Decision on something that you sacrifice.
For the greater good.
Maybe you've given up on a dream to.
Pursue happiness for someone else by.
Understanding what we love we open up.
Ourselves to become more vulnerable and.
This is something that's very hard to do.
But a night of infinite resignation also.
Understands that the world is finite the.
World doesn't always fall into the right.
Place sometime.
You will not always win there's a limit.
To each and every one of our capacities.
And no matter how hard we try let's say.
You have all these mean superheroes who.
Manages to frickin turn back time to.
Stop you jesus.
Time travel what.
I see this is an absolute win say they.
Didn't snap thanos back sorry spoilers.
Would thanos given up giving up at this.
Point.
I don't think so and this is what jackie.
God calls for when you reach your your.
Capacity of your limit you must then.
Turn inward and here you can keep your.
Love he says as as young as the day you.
Had it and and it lives on spiritually.
Infinite this of course would be very.
Painful but you can reconcile in its.
Spiritually infinite existence i think.
It's really interesting with character i.
Said he himself gave up his love omit.
Him his life regine olsen to pursue his.
Writing at another sacrifice and i think.
That's probably why he came up with this.
Whole theory idea but that i think.
That's what makes him so interesting.
Because he truly lived his ideas i.
Criticize character guard in a previous.
Video because he explained everything.
Previously in this book either-or with.
Such perfect rationale for hundreds of.
Pages and when he talks about the.
Aesthetic and when he talks about the.
Ethic but when he talked about the.
Third-stage the religion rationale was.
Just completely thrown out the window.
And and to me whenever discussing.
Religion it has always just seemed to me.
Like blind acceptance and blind.
Following and it seemed like he wanted.
You to do the same thing but it's clear.
That i didn't understand character guard.
Because that's not what he wanted at all.
If anything he was strongly against that.
He was strongly against blinded.
Acceptance it's part of the reason why.
He criticized christianity at the time.
Because people had just accepted.
Becoming christians and it wasn't.
Something that he thought people.
Actually practiced even if you're not.
Religious you still probably blindly.
Accept a lot of ideas that's not to say.
That everyone religious blindly accept.
Ideas but you understand what i mean we.
Protect ourselves from ideas because.
Because some of them would change our.
Worldview if we accepted them some ideas.
Will never fully get pondered and.
Therefore we will never find our.
Infinite is it a coincidence that is.
Called marvel infinity war i don't think.
So.
This whole connection with marvel is so.
Cringy but i tricked you into watch a.
Listening philosophy epically.
You know my final message is this and.
It's the same as character cards you.
Have to practice your ideas you can't.
Just buy a ninja sky into how to become.
A pro gamer and then become a pro gamer.
You must practice i'm 14 and this is.
Pewdiepie i hope you guys enjoyed this.
Video it's a bit random i understand.
I really enjoyed character gods fear and.
Trembling it's a great book i kind of.
Feel like i've jumped a bit back and.
Forth too much with philosophies so but.
It's something that i enjoy reading and.
Something i enjoy sharing so i hope you.
Guys enjoy it as well.
I made a tea illogical sacrifice for you.
To hopefully enjoy this video because.
It's not gonna get any beer system by.
The figurine.
Bye-bye.
You.
