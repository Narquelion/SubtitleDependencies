Hello i wanted to talk seriously and.
Honestly for a moment.
About my thoughts on what's been going.
On for the past couple months.
And hopefully you you can get a better.
Understanding of.
My perspective i think it's time to end.
The subscribe to pewdiepie movement or.
Me.
It's something that started off as a way.
To keep me as the number one.
Most subscribed channel on youtube and.
Seeing so many people come to my support.
Other creators as well has been.
Incredibly humbling to me.
It's really really meant a lot it's.
Something i never thought i would.
Experience and it's something i thought.
Would last also for maybe.
Just a couple of days or maybe a week.
But here we are.
It's been six to seven months now and.
It's been a crazy journey.
At first it started off with people.
Doing really positive and fun things to.
Get attention.
Through subscribe to pewdiepie but.
Something i learned and.
I think hopefully it's something people.
Can understand is when you have.
90 million people riled up about.
Something you're bound to get a few.
Degenerates.
And it started off with someone spray.
Painting.
Sub to pewdiepie on a world war ii.
Memorial and just so disgusting.
So disappointing to have my name and.
Community uh.
Dragged into that i addressed it on.
Twitter i disavowed it.
We saw that it got removed and and.
Donated to the park.
Hoped that that was gonna be it i didn't.
Want hateful acts to.
Overpower all these amazing things that.
People were doing all these cool and.
Positive things.
But then something happened that i don't.
Think.
Anyone would have predicted the.
Christchurch.
Shooter said subscribe to pewdiepie out.
Of the the respect for.
The families and victims involved i.
Chose not to address it any further than.
On twitter where i disavowed the actions.
Taken that day and i.
Gave my sincerest condolences to.
Everyone affected to have my name.
Associated.
With something so unspeakably vile has.
Affected me in more ways than i let.
Shown i just didn't want to address it.
Right away.
And i didn't want to give the terrorist.
Any more attention.
I didn't want to make it about me.
Because i i don't think it has anything.
To do with me to put it plainly i didn't.
Want hate to win.
But it's clear to me now the sub.
Subscribe.
To pewdiepie movement should have ended.
Then lastly my feelings around the.
Subscribe to pewdiepie thing would not.
Be complete without mentioning t-series.
Uh i made two diss tracks that were made.
In fun.
Ironic jess they were not meant to be.
Taken seriously.
And now high court in india demands that.
They're gonna be blocked.
And removed this was all made to be fun.
But it's clearly not fun anymore.
It's clearly gone too far and out of.
Respect for that i'm gonna.
Keep the videos blocked on a similar.
Note some people in some media.
Has made this sub to pewdiepie thing.
About.
Race or about politics or nationality.
And i don't agree with that at all and i.
Want that to stop.
This negative rhetoric is something i.
Don't agree with at all and i want that.
To stop and to make it perfectly clear.
No i'm not racist i don't support any.
Form of.
Racist comments or hate towards anyone.
Finally.
I don't want hitting 100 million.
Subscribers to be about.
Beating another channel i think what.
We've accomplished is so much more than.
That.
And i just want to say i feel incredibly.
Lucky to have such an amazing group of.
People supporting me.
I think i can say that because i know.
Them better than anyone i.
Ironically i'm so proud of this.
Community and this movement started out.
Of love and support.
So let's end it with that i hope that.
You understand my perspective.
And i ask you kindly to accept it thank.
You for listening.
That's all bye.
