Alert shoot this morning saturday.
October 23rd.
Authorities detected that a nuclear.
Attack had commenced against the united.
States god damn that's creepy.
Washington d.c new york philadelphia.
And boston oh he just killed a b dude.
What an axel so he's an artist from.
Toronto.
Don't say which artist it's a 40-foot.
Creature.
And it's five-minute indie game capture.
The heart my heart has been captured.
Hasn't been captured before you guys.
So is this the artist that drew a siren.
Head yeah trevor henderson's the.
Original creator.
It's four months ago jesus am i slow or.
What i'm a 24 year old.
Soldier and after what happened to me i.
Had an uncontrollable fear of sirens.
Every saturday i feel like i.
Heard about this before every saturday.
Night at camp i can hear screams that.
Only i can hear i wake up my friends.
Sometimes just to see the reaction and.
Maybe.
Figure out a solution about it maybe.
Check it out or something but they never.
Heard a thing.
Every time i hear those screams they're.
Either a man or a woman.
Or a child scream but there's something.
Peculiar about them.
It has this quite noticeable static.
Sound every time someone screams.
Or should i say whenever scream plays.
It sounds like it's coming out of a.
Siren and it wakes me up every night.
I learned to ignore it and i thought.
It's probably just me imagining things.
Since i didn't like sirens that much as.
A kid either too loud to be enjoyable it.
Wakes me up every night.
And it sounds very realistic so i.
Thought i should ask the headmaster if.
Our sirens accidentally play those weird.
Sounds at night next morning i talked to.
Him about it and he said that it may.
Have been an error but even if it was.
The signs were turned off at night only.
The alarm ones.
Were on i tried to get him to look.
Deeper into this thing because i doubt.
It was just an error and i was sure it.
Was coming from a siren.
But he said he thinks i'm talking.
Nonsense and sent me to do some.
Exercises with the other soldiers.
He might have been right i maybe was.
Just a bit paranoid this night the.
Sounds weren't that loud.
It sounded as if it was playing from.
Somewhere inside the forest.
I couldn't take it anymore i had to.
Check it out i grabbed a flashlight a.
Shotgun.
And sneaked out a camp to go into the.
Forest and investigate.
I know i may sound like a dumbass for.
Doing this like going out of.
Camp to check it out but those screams.
Were making my sanity fall apart.
I kept walking and walking nothing was.
Found.
But i could hear the sounds getting.
Louder i was sure i was approaching it.
You're approaching me i ended up in a.
Straight dirt road.
Then i saw something it was too dark to.
See but i could see something really.
Freaky in the dark.
It was in the middle of the road so i.
Pointed my flashlight on it and there it.
Was a slim monster.
That was about as tall as a tree having.
Long arms that could reach its toes and.
For a head two sirens connected into a.
Tube.
It looked very skinny as if it was only.
Bones but you could clearly see some.
Flesh on it.
And it had metallic wires going through.
Its body i was terrified but without a.
Second thoughts.
I immediately held my gun and shot it it.
Didn't die.
But the bullet marks were clear and i.
Could see some blood running down but.
Instead of showing signs of pain.
It started walking towards me without.
Any second thoughts i ran the opposite.
Direction from where i was facing.
The siren mimicked my scream and played.
It again oh that's so creepy.
The static sounds always get me feeling.
In my stomach.
But from close up it was more terrifying.
It then started to play.
Some other weird sounds coming from its.
Iron such as tornado warnings amber.
Alert announcement.
And generally announced sir speaking.
About scary things such as murders.
Criminal escapes and other messed up.
Stuff.
I could run really fast but even though.
It was walking it wasn't that far.
Away from me let's say i was far enough.
For it to not catch me i grabbed my gun.
Again.
Stopped and shot a siren the sound it.
Was playing were glitched out i managed.
To outrun it but it started approaching.
Me pretty quick.
I was far enough but i could still see.
In the dark i was running for about half.
An hour felt more like an eternity.
Our distance didn't even change by a.
Centimeter it felt like i was running on.
An infinite road.
Luckily i could see a car though someone.
Was there whoever it was i needed them.
To get away from that thing.
But to my disappointment it was long big.
Mistake stopping.
The monster was now a bit closer and the.
Road got really bloody so it slowed me.
Down oh that's so creepy.
I got out of the road and got inside the.
Forest it didn't come in.
I could see it facing at me but it's not.
Moving i saw my camp.
I was relieved but still scared to stop.
And relax i asked the guards to let me.
In.
And since they knew me they obviously.
Opened the door they asked me what i was.
Doing outside this lane and how did i.
Get out.
I apologized and asked them to keep it.
Secret but i later explained to them.
What i saw and how i felt.
They probably felt sorry for me and.
Thought that i was being paranoid.
So they told me to get some rest i swore.
To them i didn't lie for what i had seen.
They still didn't believe me i shrugged.
It up and went back to bed.
That night i was so terrified it was the.
Most scary experience i ever had.
Around 5-6 a.m i woke up to sounds of.
Screams and subtle smell of smoke.
I came outside to see what woke me up.
Everything was on fire.
Towers were torn apart and i could see.
Piles of dead bodies.
The thing that caught my eyes though was.
What i had seen some hours ago.
That tall skinny siren head monster it.
Was responsible for everything.
Soldiers begged me to help them but i.
Could do nothing about it they were.
Literally torn in half.
The monster saw me and reached out to.
Grab me it missed.
The whole camp was on fire i even.
Wondered if i was in hell.
I ran and i ran it chased me but never.
Stopped running.
After running for so long i came to the.
End of the cliff and now that there was.
Light i saw the monster more clearly.
And now it was more terrifying than.
Before it stopped walking.
I'd hear a crispy yet soothing voice.
Coming out of the siren.
Do you like heights mark how could this.
Monster know my name.
This had to be a never-ending nightmare.
But it was reality.
Come to me i begged the monster not to.
Kill me i cried and i asked it to leave.
Me alone.
To my surprise it left not sure if it.
Regrets its decision or just wanted to.
Get revenge later.
As i watched it turn around and.
Disappear into the woods.
I felt relieved that i escaped out of.
The situation.
I went back to camp just to see all.
Those dead bodies and broken buildings.
But i had to call someone or i wasn't.
Leaving this place i'm always carrying.
My cell phone so i called 9-1-1 and told.
Them.
To come to the camp address when they.
Arrived they told me to explain.
Everything.
What happened and how i survived it i.
Described everything by detail.
But they thought i was joking and told.
Me to act serious i told them i was.
And they finally took it seriously sort.
Of they said they'd investigate this.
I packed my stuff and they brought me.
Back to the city i went back home and.
Was happy to see my wife and kids.
They were surprised i came so early i.
Was supposed to come five months later.
I explained to my wife what had happened.
And she just wouldn't believe me.
She said i probably needed some rest and.
Got all this    out of my crazy.
Imagination.
All this makes me curious am i living in.
A nightmare was i actually paranoid.
Whatever it was it's done for now.
I pushed the curtains aside and opened.
The window to get some fresh air.
I looked outside it felt good to be home.
But what i saw in the distance.
Made me feel shocked that monster was on.
Top of a building really far away.
I tried to ignore it and went to get.
Some sleep i probably need to book a.
Therapy session.
That was really creepy it's a cool.
Creepypasta gets you in the mood man.
It seems like people are just jumping in.
To become like the next slender.
I mean at least slender had gameplay.
I'll give them that you know all right i.
Have another game let's play that one.
Okay here we go.
Different art style this feels relaxing.
I like this i'm not scared at all i got.
Freaking dude very aesthetic all right.
We go in here oh we go in here.
All right the strategy not dad.
Not dead.
It's probably just an ambulance in the.
Middle of the woods.
Oh god stop i found it i found the.
Backpack guys.
Oh god why is that so creepy stop.
No no no.
Oh okay it's a scrap of shirt looked.
Like there was struggle.
Story of my shirts right there who wears.
Them am i right gamers.
Tucked in t-shirt every time what.
Happened here nothing.
Nothing oh god that's fine.
That's just uh that's just dirt come on.
If you're scared of dirt then you're.
Dirt yourself dirt that's an underrated.
Video game right there.
Dirt 3 is my favorite all right we got.
Something happening over here.
Very nice it's a tree it's at a tree.
It's literally just a tree.
And more red dirt which is common around.
Woods i hear red dirt yeah absolutely.
Red durst has some red dirt that's.
Normal as well.
I got to get back to the truck now.
Stop stop stop.
Oh god he's coming.
I don't like radio you're dead you're.
Supposed to be dead.
You're old media.
Did he say scientific scientifically.
Accurate.
Wouldn't be epic if you just dropped.
Like a pewdiepie reference.
How's it going bros all right we're fine.
He's slow i don't have to look i don't.
Have to run that's a celebius.

Your butt baby let's go.
Yeah speed running.
That's it right i told you i'm pro.
Laughter.
Oh god that was creepy i guess you only.
Really have these.
Sort of small games for now it's.
Interesting though i feel like this uh.
Creepypasta is really gonna blow up it's.
Already weird fan art.
Siren head approves it was the same.
Thing with slender.
The story about slenderman kept changing.
You know people came up with different.
Ideas.
He abducts kids or he does this or that.
And it always changed like what does he.
Do what is he.
It's all just based in people's mind i.
Think that's fun.
How the internet does that hey we got.
Some siren head facts.
Looks like he hasn't eaten it in a while.
Oh god but why.
Fuse with dried skin it's a pretty cool.
Concept.
Surprisingly effective will remain.
Motionless while hunting that's so.
Creepy.
Seen in rural town areas and in heavily.
Wooded areas.
I want to see what's the first drawing.
He did of siren head.
Because he draws a ton of different.
Stuff see that's terrifying.
That's so.
Music.
Oh my god.
Music.
Yeah of course in the cars.
That's truly terrifying wait what is.
This i fixed my camera it was only the.
System broken elsa.
I decided to come back again and show.
You the place.
Whoa.
This place is under control by the.
Government i don't know what is.
Happening.
And what they are planning there with my.
Headphones it sounds crazy.
They rumble like oh god i started to.
Hear white noise sounds when.
I arrived and i saw something behind the.
Trees oh no.
Oh my god where.
Where i don't see it oh that's just a.
Pole thank god.
I thought that was iron head but.
That's creepy goddamn.
