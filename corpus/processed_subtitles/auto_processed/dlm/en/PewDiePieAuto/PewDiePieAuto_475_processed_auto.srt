Youtube oopsy poopsy and that's it good.
Evening i'm poppy fourier lead anchor of.
Pew news the most esteemed news source.
Of all time our first news come youtube.
Youtube ad say it with me you too bad.
They posted on twitter saying many of.
You has told us that we need to do a.
Better job preventing harassment on.
Youtube doubt doubt i'm pressing the x.
It's a big x here we consulted with a.
Wide array of creator style experts and.
Organizations to update a harassment.
Policy which changed today doubt here's.
What it covers all right well let's read.
Through this let's break this down the.
Official blog let's go through it.
Doesn't matter the thing that i've.
Learned about youtube's policies is that.
It doesn't matter what they say what.
Matters is how they enforce it and we've.
Already seen how it's done they may they.
Change this harassment policy their.
First move their first order of business.
Apparently was to remove idubbbz leafy.
Content cup that was it thank god they.
Updated the policy so they can get rid.
Of this video finally what if you read.
The blog post it says beyond threatening.
Someone there is also demeaning language.
That goes too far too far idubbbz too.
Far when i dub said chin small too far.
It's so stupid.
Apparently allegedly leafy himself has.
Said that this is complete bogus his.
Whole channel leafy himself is made of.
Criticizing other channels come back.
Leafy come back we miss you we need you.
Diet we're in dire need over here heel.
Knee first of all why retroactive lee.
Takes down videos if you're gonna make a.
New policy change then go from there.
Don't go back in in old videos to say.
Actually this one this one bad what is.
That fix reading more in this blog post.
It's.
Clear that they made this as a response.
To what happened earlier this year.
Between steven crowder and that vox guy.
And crowder was poking fun of his.
Homosexual mannerisms which i will not.
Replicate because whenever i think about.
It i just can't believe anyone would do.
That i'm joking of course we'll get more.
Into that harassment hurts our community.
By making people less inclined to share.
Their opinion and engage with each other.
We heard this from time and time again.
From creators this does the opposite.
Youtube creators are    degenerates.
They're the worst people out there.
Speaking from a youtuber we pull the.
Worst imaginable just to get views on.
This side that's how we get paid thus.
Far yes i use that word the only thing.
Keeping these youtube vultures in check.
Are other youtubers we have this anarchy.
System okay and don't come and ruin it.
For us youtube the rule is if you do.
Dumb    on youtube you will get called.
Out on it.
We need that it's the only thing keeping.
Us sane youtube don't take it away from.
Us please a couple examples and this is.
Just a handful daddio five making videos.
Abusing children his own kids or step.
Kids i don't know was it youtube that.
Strike down those videos was a youtube.
That took the first step in action to.
Make sure something happened there no no.
It was other youtubers guess they can.
Just flag them down for bullying now the.
Same tactics is used i'm not gonna name.
The scumbags name but it's same tactics.
Is used right now we're another.
Degenerate creator is getting criticized.
By other youtubers the way the tactic he.
Uses to strike it down is to copy strike.
Those videos so he gets the money from.
Those creators now you're just giving.
More tools to these scumbags to strike.
Down criticism logan paul showed a video.
With a a    dead body.
A corpse it wasn't removed by youtube no.
No no no no no it was removed by logan.
After other people criticized him.
Promoting gambling to kids did youtube.
Do anything about that no    you know.
It was other creators that notice it and.
Called it out making videos milking.
People's reason.
Passing our youtube gonna addict policy.
For that because previous leads.
Youtubers telling people to not do these.
Things and otherwise they would get away.
With it if youtube know what's good at.
Them they'll keep their    hands.
Out of this well-developed.
100 percent unclog system where you dumb.
You get called out that's just how it is.
I don't dumb    to i get called out.
It's epic it's not epic actually but.
It's good it's good for everyone.
Further on they say we've always removed.
Videos that explicitly threatened.
Someone reveal confidential information.
And encourage people to harass someone.
Moving forward our policy will go and.
Step further and not only prohibit.
Explicit threats but also implied.
Threats we don't want to be dumb fury.
Enough so we're gonna dump three some.
More we're gonna go a step further on.
Our dumb finish bucky implied threats i.
Think it's really good because youtube.
100% knows the intent of people the.
Video called.
And why they censored the thumbnail.
Because it was just completely horrible.
It's called the death of hd hd it was a.
Video criticizing a straight street.
Whatever your opinion on the video is it.
Got removed and i think it was because.
He was holding a gun towards h3h3 in the.
In the thumbnail i think i think that's.
How i remember it.
Eh trees it's scared for his safety.
Because today that video needed to be.
Gone i mean everyone knew a she or she.
Was in big trouble because of his.
Personal safety thanks to that thumbnail.
I mean my god what do we have done no.
One thinks he's going to shoot a tree.
Tree just cuz he holds up a gun no one.
Is fearing for a safety why are you.
Doing that why is there no distinction.
Between intent and actual action it's.
Not that hard to tell in a part in.
English so i asked you to provide this.
Cuz i was kind of worried where they're.
Gonna draw the distinction and they said.
That this tracks will fall under.
Artistic content and scripted comedy and.
Sanap is fine but you can't abuse the.
Artistic content as an excuse to keep.
Harassing someone a lot of people raise.
The question i've seen other youtubers.
Being like okay so why can't late-night.
Show hosts you know make fun of donald.
Trump as an example because they're.
Pretty relentless with it to a point.
Where it just stop being funny years.
Ago but apparently it's an american.
Media rule this is just what i've heard.
That says that you can ridicule public.
Figures that's fine thank god thank god.
Public figures are still up to ridicule.
Aren't we old public figures on youtube.
Isn't that the point like this doesn't.
Make sense to me why do they get a pass.
And some don't it seems very selective.
If someone understands explain to me i.
Don't understand this it should be the.
Same and to summarize this i think it.
Seems the same case for a lot of.
Youtube's update where the intention is.
Good i don't think people should get.
Attacked for their sexual identity or.
But it's always like this is what we.
Want to strike down and then all these.
Other things and consequences is the.
Result of it and i don't understand how.
That happens every time.
It's like hopper wasn't enough there's.
No kids content or youtube and there's.
No edgy content anymore on youtube but.
What we have here encapsulated it's very.
Nice very nice mmm delicious stale.
Content tastes so stale mmm.
Lights are coaching little big things.
It's so boring but it's so media.
Friendly poppies moorea from the future.
Here i don't have time to record this.
But i wanted to make an update on the.
Whole cough less situation that i.
Covered last week for those of you don't.
Know now as a creator you have to tag.
Your video if it's made for kids or if.
It isn't and there's a lot of confusion.
Based on what is family-friendly then or.
What is made for kids and it's still.
Pretty unclear but hopefully we'll get.
More update question mark where the.
Distinction is we sold ready that a lot.
Of channels were flying that's for kids.
When they clearly were not and i got.
Really upset about it because i think.
It's    that youtube besides and.
Then they're wrong when you could lose.
Up to 90 percent of your revenue but.
According to what i've heard it's closer.
To 60% okay it still sucks but the main.
Issue i'm making this update is because.
Because even if youtube tag your video.
Ass made for kids.
You can still remove that tag it's not.
Like a branding mating i don't know iron.
Fork or something you can still remove.
It it doesn't matter what matters is.
That you.
Make your own distinction if your.
Content is made for kids or not and the.
Fine that is quoted for the two thousand.
From the ftc if you make it an issue is.
Only if you're a big youtuber and i'm.
The one that's gonna get that fine if.
Your smaller youtuber and you happen to.
Get fine which seems unlikely because.
They're not just gonna go over after the.
Bigger ones first anyway so it's still.
Very frustrating and it's still very.
Annoying but it's not as panic mode as.
It seems at least that's what i gathered.
From it so i just wanted to update you.
