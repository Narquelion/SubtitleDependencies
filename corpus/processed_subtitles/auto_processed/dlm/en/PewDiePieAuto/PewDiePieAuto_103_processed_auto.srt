Here we are ghost of tsushima.
Apparently it's an island i didn't know.
That.
Thank you for all the comment that.
Pointed that out.
Um i'm not.
Really that immersed into the story so.
Far i'm not gonna lie it's kind of.
Not that interesting so far what do you.
Guys think.
Hoping it picks up but the whole it's.
Just that we just played a game.
With a revenge plot so it's kind of like.
I don't know do i really want to.
Another one.
But it has some really nice    to it.
Okay now i can see and now we can play.
And now we can talk to lady with flute.
Oh lady with flute why are you wearing.
Underpant.
Epic.
Should we explore a little bit there's.
The kamatsu forge.
We can get waxwood guys.
Why don't we just explore while we're.
Still here.
Why not just get some wax float.
While we're at it what the hell is.
Happening there.
I can't call jurgen right now are you.
Serious.
This revenge plot is better than last of.
Us to to be honest well.
I it's gotta be hard not to make it.
Better than.
Oh man thank you terence ross.
Holy    i'm playing a float.
Swipe left and you play a flute.
Music.
I love that.
What happens if i swipe right.
I draw my sword or i draw my flute.
I can bow by swiping down and swipe up.
Is to win cool hey damon what's up man.
Oh now i can call you again.
Now how the hell do i get up there.
I feel like i gotta remind myself a.
Little bit how to play.
I know i haven't finished the task but i.
Kind of want to just look around.
I know i'm annoying like that.
Music.
So many people are getting annoyed that.
I'm playing on jab with j oh that looks.
Pretty.
Should we go there we're japanese.
Dub it is annoying how they prioritized.
English with the uh with the dubbing.
There's the mongolians.
But it is what it is.
Damn so pretty.
They really just went full out on.
Atmosphere.
Ipads my first first time doing it.
Through a stream but my.
Thank you say hi to edgar edgar says hey.
Some comments i read said that.
Apparently the mongolians did.
Try to evade japan but they failed.
Mainly because of a typhoon.
And not because of the samurai but i'm.
Sure that's just what the.
Mongolians like to tell each other.
We found a little house.
Such a cool looking game.
Let's see what we got.
Oh my god that bug is so disturbing.
It's the second time.
We out here we're entering random.
People's houses.
Maybe we should go back to the objective.
My bad just wanted to look down around a.
Little bit since it's been a while since.
I play.
Uh and yes some people are cringing over.
Me speaking japanese.
I think people misinterpret me wanting.
To learn.
Japanese as opposed to me being.
Trying to pretend that i speak it or.
Like i'm an annoying.
Weave that goes.
Uh full on the hunger.
Epicly i feel like uh.
It's such a difficult language that any.
Chance i can get.
To immerse myself or or remind myself of.
A word i'll take it.
I don't care if it sounds cringy you're.
Cringy shut up.
So long story short i'm not a weeb okay.
Just so we're clear i'm not a weeb.
All right let's go to the objective then.
My bad.
Let's deal with the.
Lady masako can we fast travel there.
Let's just do that then.
Music.
I feel like the most effective way to.
Learn is to suggest to immerse yourself.
Um at least from what i can tell.
You can study it all you want but if you.
Don't practice actually saying words out.
Loud it's such a difference.
Uh where is she.
I read somewhere that 9 out of 10 that.
Try to study japanese don't.
Learn japanese it's pretty crazy.
Because it is such a language where like.
You have to dedicate.
Your next couple years actually really.
Studying it.
All right here she is.
Let's continue this quest.
Forever.
I don't think i have enough.
But yeah i'll prevent myself from.
Repeating the japanese just so you guys.
Can't cringe at me.
Just kidding i don't care okay i don't.
Care.
Uh where's the armor lady was she here.
I forgot where she was.
Oh it is here.
Now we're missing supplies god damn it.

Do do are you okay there bird thank you.
Another hot spring what do you guys want.
To meditate on.
Music.
What do you guys ladie masako masako.
I just want to clear my mind i don't.
Want to think about any.
Any girls any problem.
Just empty my mind.
I feel better.
I think the favorite thing for me with.
Meditating is.
It puts you in the moment.
When you're always doing stuff.
Um especially nowadays it's so easy to.
Get distracted you just go on your phone.
Or you just.
Watch someone's live stream you just.
Click click click there's a click away.
To always get distracted but.
Take some time and meditate because it.
Really helps.
Changing your uh mindset of.
It breaks you away from that cycle of.
Constant distraction and it puts you in.
The moment.
I recommend that's right.
Why did i call jurgen here clearly he.
Can't go.
How the hell did he even get up here.
Because once you're put in the moment.
You actually enjoy things differently.
In a better way healthier way.
The idea of just me uh being distracted.
My entire life and.
Not enjoying the moment to me it's a.
Very terrifying.
Thing i would never want to do that.
You can you can live a life where you're.
Just comfortable.
With distracting yourself they are and.
Then your whole life flashes by.
Without any ever doing any reflection.
Not epic.
I think that's why i hate these uh.
Youtube channels that uh.
I don't hate the person but i hate the.
Idea that they send out uh.
Don't mean to call it i'll tell you.
After this.
Let's kill these.
That took so much damage i'm so dead.
Oh he did that attack.
Oh he used any friends.
They did you dirty man.
Music.
Nice that's one more right.
Poor archers nice.
What was i talking about.
Uh distractions can you make a clip of.
That.
Oh put minecraft music on it.
All right we're almost there might as.
Well walk.
Uh these channels that are focused on.
Maximizing your uh.
Productivity which i i think is there's.
Something good in.
A middle ground there but when you see.
These channels that are like i don't.
Sleep i sleep four hours.
I have every minute of my day scheduled.
Out.
I am so productive look at all these.
Things i do in a day from eight to nine.
I do this and then from nine to ten i do.
This and then.
From 10 to 11 i do this and then i do.
This and then i do this and then i do.
This and then i do this and then i do.
This and then i meditate for 10 minutes.
Uh.
I can't even explain why i hate it so.
Much i think because people.
It's fun to watch in a way it's engaging.
So you kind of get swept into it.
But in reality i would hate to live a.
Life like that.
I think it's selling this idea that.
You're.
You're gonna be happy if you're really.
Productive or something like that.
You're just distracting yourself.
The husband.
