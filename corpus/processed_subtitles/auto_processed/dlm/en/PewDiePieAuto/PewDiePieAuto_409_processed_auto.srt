Week's tea comes from trisha paytas i'm.
About five weeks late on this it was one.
Of those things where you see in your.
Peripheral you like i don't really care.
About that but then the more you look.
Into it you're like jesus christ at the.
Full block and that's about it.
With trisha paytas and sally i couldn't.
Be a teletubby but you know what i.
Became one heshe might be a lot of.
Things.
Teletubby is not one of them liar.
Manipulator playing victim aggressive.
Abusive not a teletubby so what has she.
Done recently well a couple things.
Two things i knew about trisha from this.
God forbid and video called showering.
With my boyfriend whatever you do do not.
Watch this video it's a cursed video i.
Don't know buddy.
Just don't watch this video.
Me with my sleep paralysis to whoever.
Was the cameraman we send a deeper.
Trisha has been wheezing her way in in.
Different ways where i hope that would.
Never see her again after that video.
She's been part of the david dobrik.
Vlogs she's been doing her regulars feel.
Of crying almost as good as me crying in.
My car there recently she got there in a.
Bit the drama with nick although i would.
Called though do you want to lose some.
Brain cells great keep watching you see.
Trisha paytas had the competition for.
Who would make a cover of her song and.
Nicole called me the beautiful song.
It's actually not bad i didn't know you.
Had any other talent but crying about.
Who god knows what while eating did you.
Send a hotel room when you give up on.
Your talent and dreams mukbang yeah.
Trisha saw this cover that nicole diver.
Called the death of her video and she be.
Like i have loved you for so long as a.
Fan and this blew my mind when i saw it.
In the subscription so she was.
Subscribed even we need to get together.
In person there is something about you.
And then this i'm speechless.
Truly i can't think of the right words.
To say and then she tweets him going.
Like hey babe where do you live we need.
To call them love is a pair you're never.
Brought tears tm what relevance does.
This have to anything felix well i'll.
Have you know that trisha invited him to.
Collab he flew all the way from colombia.
And she just ghosted him uh-huh.
Okay so trisha paytas right now i've.
Been watching you for a few months i.
Just adore you i don't know if you've.
Seen my videos about not one to be vegan.
Anymore but it would be so fun to eat.
Something non vegan with you she respond.
Hell yeah.
Actually i'm pretty free next week what.

Next week - i just do youtube that's a.
Super flexible so you can pick the day.
I'm looking at flights now so i let her.
Know i'm flying i said i'm looking at.
The flights i'll let her know.
Are you available but she says i'm free.
All week i said i've never been to.
California before the best flight deal.
Is tuesday the 17th then she responds i.
Can make that work i can make that work.
Hi trisha i came to la to see ya but i.
Don't know how to get a whole yeah.
Is everything okay next one says if i.
Did something wrong he let me know i.
Have gifts from you from colombia he.
Brought gifts from colombia this is.
Opposed to be cringe we're getting into.
The cringe the cringe is bad area if it.
Has meaning behind it.
Okay but the best part about this is.
That even though trisha clearly publicly.
Said that she subscribed to him watch.
His videos and wanted to collab with him.
On mine there's a different story.
Music.
I was never going to i wasn't gonna like.
Collab you heard a meanie i don't know.
Where that came from your text message.
Where that come from.
And i was like they were all like trisha.
Goes to him i was like trisha didn't.
Even know that he was coming no idea no.
Idea no i dad don't like all that the.
Only thing i heard of him wasn't he did.
My warrior cover you said you were.
Subscribed in the comments of that video.
The only thing i heard of him was what.
He did my warrior brah well i thank you.
So many people him and a lot of your.
Fans want to hear an apology i'm not.
Sorry i feel like you don't know anyway.
Anything you really know can you.
Acknowledge that ghosting him was rude i.
Don't i don't think it's not really you.
Know you're messed up big time if paris.
Hilton is the voice of reason i don't.
Know what you want me to say like i'm.
Not gonna pawn as this person is like.
Like you know what i mean like there's.
Something like a little off here asked.
He lied i didn't.
I felt harassed by him that was it was.
Still insane it was so insane it's so.
Scary to me so then she just completely.
Changed the story because you know.
Trisha can't be the bad person the.
Reason why she goes to him was she was.
Scared of him that's right because.
Naqada avocado had a thumbnail where he.
Had a knife and said i had enough and.
She's just scared of him so now that we.
Know that she's not a good person it's.
Okay to make fun of her yeah the next.
Stop came from h street street where i.
Followed this it was really funny.
Basically ethan did a video calling out.
The instagram versus reality subreddit.
Where you have pictures like this i.
Actually wanted to make a video in this.
My my eye that's too high i'm not.
Touching that someone's gonna lash out.
Lo and behold trisha paytas saw that.
Video cuz she was in it i can't even.
Tell him is any of these trisha peters.
Like honestly cannot help there.
Why do you why are you even a model if.
You're gonna modify your looks that much.
It's like from beauty queen to wwf.
Wrestler in two seconds.
You cannot foix up your heart and soul.
Remember that this girl tried to use a.
Face filter on instagram and her phone.
Blew up she is the best isn't she not.
The best would people even recognize her.
If they saw her on the street i mean i.
Mean to be afraid you probably do this.
With almost anyone probably not to the.
Same extreme but you can take a photo.
There's no ugly photos of me however but.
Over someone else you could take an ugly.
Photo and then like a bam photo and be.
Like yeah this is coachella verse.
Throwing down in the mcdonald's parking.
Lot at 3 a.m.
Chella vs. worldstarhiphop oh that.
Cannot be the same person to coachella.
Versus open-casket funeral so how did.
Trish i responded to this video of.
Course she had the most eloquent.
Thought-out response that really put.
Ethan to place please allah cline h3 do.
Not raise your child to be as ignorant.
As your husband i would divorce him asap.
As he is causing so much damage to young.
Women.
It's basically second act i never been.
More disgusted i think that's pretty.
Fair just tweeting someone's pregnant.
Wife how to race their child and to.
Leave their husband jesus christ could.
You have been any more gross about it i.
Wasn't gonna say anything but obviously.
When people attack ela it's mask off and.
I saw her profile pic and i go who was.
This rude person i don't recognize her.
From her profile picture does anyone.
00.
In the morning sitting on the kitchen.
Floor hey guys what is up is and then.
She even admits to not even having to.
Watch his video big platform and like.
Shaving these women like i did.
Fast-forward to my part i don't really.
Watch the other people he talked about.
Chloe and then right after me jesus.
Christ.
I felt like ethan's video yeah it was.
Making fun of people obviously that's a.
Sensitive topic i get it but i think.
It's worth criticizing these things.
Where instagram has just become this.
Staple of how people compare themselves.
To.
Look on these insanely retouched photos.
Or edited photos me like okay why don't.
Why not look like that when the reality.
Is actually quite different and i think.
That's a lot more damaging than making.
Fun of it don't need a beep beep like.
That dowell like the reason i post those.
Ugly photos next to eight pretty photos.
Wait so she's the one that posed these.
Photos she's the one that she's the.
Source other people can't laugh at it.
Though cuz i do i always want girls to.
Know that like it's okay to like be like.
This.
This was ethan's message as well that's.
Literally what he said if you had.
Watched the damn video instead of.
Lashing out on his wife jesus christ.
Dude.
Now trisha paytas has done some pretty.
Funny things she said some pretty great.
Stuff i feel like she does play into the.
Dumb blonde role like she purposely try.
And make her stupid dogs are and are.
Mammals right yeah dogs are mammals.
They're humans or no they're not human.
They're part of the animal kingdom that.
God created i love you do this that is.
An amazing sense yeah dogs are mammals.
They're humans dogs are human no they're.
Not human they're part of the animal.
Kingdom that god created i love you.
Jesus ah but my absolute favorite video.
Of trisha paytas is the teletubby.
Breakdown video i love to tell that me.
Teletubbies are my.
With the other timers are am i where am.
I who am i trisha paytas i love to tell.
That we teletubbies are my they are your.
What.
None need oh my god she actually forgot.
But more than my life they saved my life.
I think back when i was like 10 just had.
Not 9 not 11 just 10 just 10 not eight.
Not seven not six not 40 not 50 not 500.
Just ten and i wanted to be a teletubby.
Nobody trisha paytas i wanna be $1 are.
They coming and sally i couldn't be a.
Teletubby but you know what this is so.
Sad.
I became one oh okay.
I am once hey i'm not stopping yet jesus.
Christ.
Music.
I am a mother he caught up yet i don't.
Mean that metaphorically i am a literal.
Towelettes abby.
So she says she wasn't on drugs early.
Can we applaud my realness baby.
Communists up la my realness    but um.
There's some fake-ass youtubers out.
There so anyone that says real and fake.
Is fake anyone says i'm so real other.
People are fake they're hundred percent.
Fake i never if there's no exception to.
That rule for those of you the less is.
Filty and    i'm not doing real i.
Like a    talk about everything.
Like you didn't even knew half the.
That these youtubers talk about another.
One night you today i genuinely do i.
Ain't perfect but i love the sub dummies.
And i can't.
No don't eat it don't do whatever i.
Can't chew in over my head anymore i.
Look at this oh my god trish.
Do you remember goddamnit.
Music.
Okay that is about as much as i can.
Stomach for cringe tuesday's that's.
Stricture paid us everyone i'm sorry for.
Bringing this to light.
I feel like trisha belongs in this.
Category of youtubers i just have no.
Shame it's like the mukbang videos no.
One wants to watch those videos you.
Might say oh well some people like them.
Sure like what 2% of people that's not.
The reason they exist there they're.
Flashy thumbnail and people are grossed.
Out by them people don't want to see.
That people are outraged about them this.
Kind of content that no one wants to see.
It's kind of content where you're crying.
On camera deliberately which i would.
Never go just whatever it takes to get.
Views on youtube there's no shame.
Whatsoever but trisha is the exception.
Of at the same time just being insanely.
Insecure which is not a good combination.
She does have some likeable qualities.
Though like she's.
What you never played super simulator.
You know it's fun right i'm not supposed.
To give my opinion but give it a try and.
Then you can tell me if it's good or not.
Not convinced yet okay i'll cut you a.
Deal.
The game is available for free and.
That's a great price.
