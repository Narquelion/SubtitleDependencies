A few months ago our house is broken.
Into no one was at home at the time when.
It happened but it was surprising to.
Find out nonetheless the word about the.
Breaking got around quickly as news.
Articles covered the event most people.
Were very supportive of course but a few.
People in the internet.
Took the news as a chance to celebrate.
Rationalizing it as since i have wealth.
And having to replace some items in my.
Home it's just a minor inconvenience.
Really for once a reaction about me was.
Made completely without my influence.
Another irony is that nothing was stolen.
From the break-in at least personally.
Even my two most valuable items my.
Camera and computer were left whatever.
They took was from my wife unfortunately.
I had previously been decluttering in my.
House but now i finally shifted to a new.
Gear i got rid of anything i didn't want.
Ton of items that i only kept because i.
Didn't want anyone else to have them or.
At least take them like awards all items.
That had barely any sentimentality.
Things i had stored away never to.
Actually be used if any item lacked.
Value or utility i sold donated or just.
Got rid of it at the same time i was.
Reading about diogenes the ancient greek.
Philosopher who only lived with one item.
In his possession which was a wooden.
Bowl even this he got rid of on the day.
When he saw a peasant boy drinking water.
By cupping his hands he tossed the ball.
Away and said fool that i am to have.
Been carrying this superfluous baggage.
All this time there are many stories.
About diogenes some seemed too great to.
Be true but i'm glad to know he at least.
Lived you can find him on old paintings.
Which depicts him living in a barrel tub.
Or most commonly a large urine if you.
Know about diogenes you most likely.
Already know of his famous encounter.
With alexander the great alexander had.
Heard about their journeys philosophy.
And was personally intrigued by him so.
One day he stuck out diogenes who was.
Relaxing on a field in the morning sun.
Alexander as diogenes if there's any.
Favor he could do for him he would do it.
By our journeys then replied yes by.
Moving away since you were covering the.
Sun alexander declared shortly after if.
I wasn't alexander then i wish to be.
Diogenes this is such a perfect example.
Of two extremes meeting each.
I think the fact that alexander the.
World lord who had reached more status.
Wealth and power than anyone in his time.
Could have ever dreamed up still felt.
Humbled by their journeys a man who had.
Seemingly nothing coming to this.
Conclusion he must have realized that.
The things we value actually carries.
Little satisfaction on its own and all.
The things alexander had done others.
Wanted meant nothing to diogenes in my.
Own experience what little notoriety and.
Wealth i have is still far greater than.
Anything i could have dreamed up but the.
Experience itself feels like it can be.
Compared to an hg part of your body that.
Is too far away to reach you want to.
Scratch it to see what it would feel.
Like to get rid of in the fantasy and.
The idea is always there of the pleasure.
And satisfaction it could give you until.
You finally managed to reach for it the.
Sensation fades quickly and you're left.
The same diogenes had nothing alexander.
Had everything but only one of them were.
Truly free what was diogenes philosophy.
That even alexander the great became so.
Interested in it diogenes defined and.
Was considered one of the founders of.
Cynicism this word doesn't have the same.
Meaning then as today cynic meant dog or.
Dog like which was likely said to.
Ridicule diogenes and his strange.
Behaviors he however took his name on.
His self because he actually praised the.
Dog and its virtues despite it being.
Used as an insult.
Diogenes didn't recognize society and by.
Doing so he considered himself above it.
He therefore didn't believe in shame and.
Would do almost anything a dog would do.
In public he would be seen sitting on.
The street if people insulted him he.
Would respond by urinating on them it.
Would be seen masturbating in public the.
List goes on a dog lives at ease they.
Don't think about the past or the future.
They live only according to nature just.
Like diogenes.
Despite his obscene actions diogenes was.
Still a philosopher but unlike many of.
His peers he didn't recognize.
Metaphysical ideas since to him they are.
A waste of time and a distraction from.
The moment by our journeys even had many.
Famous encounter with one of my favorite.
Philosophers plato these stories are.
Also really great he read for example.
She himself during plato's lectures just.
To distract the lesson but my favorite.
Story is there.
One of plato's lectures he was.
Discussing the metaphysical ideal forms.
Plato said that all things have a pure.
Essence each thing has a form that.
Defines their true being.
Diogenes who didn't like metaphysical.
Ideas challenge plato and pointed.
Towards a cup on a table what about this.
Cup he said is there an eternal perfect.
Cup somewhere later responded yes in.
Fact the cup can take many different.
Forms but there is a perfect form of cup.
Ness that resides inside your head then.
He supposedly insulted diogenes on his.
Simple-minded take of his complex ideas.
Diogenes then responded what about the.
Emptiness inside the cup is there a.
Perfect form of emptiness that exists as.
Well.
Plato pause for a moment to think but.
Before he got to answer the our journeys.
Pointed to plato's head and said i think.
You'll find it's in here where the.
Emptiness resides finally about diogenes.
Death.
There isn't much confirmed about this.
Either some people say he got poisoned.
By eating raw meat others insist.
Strongly that diogenes died one day when.
He decided to hold his own breath.
Diogenes final wish wasn't for a proper.
Burial but rather to be thrown over the.
Gates of the city to have the rodents.
And animals feast on his body as a way.
For him to give back to the earth when.
He had taken from it diogenes throughout.
History has often referred to as.
Socrates gone man their minds were very.
Different but they both share is that.
Neither of them wrote down their own.
Ideas they lived them instead i don't.
Think you'll see me living in a barrel.
Any time soon but i think there's a lot.
To learn from diogenes i find it funny.
How i lost more items reading about him.
Than actually getting robbed did.
