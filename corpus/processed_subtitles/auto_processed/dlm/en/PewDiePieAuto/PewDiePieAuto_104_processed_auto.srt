Music.
Music.
Music.
Music.
Music.
Music.
All right let's watch it thanks.
For watching.
Foreign.
Wow.
Let me show you guys something have you.
Guys read the.
Book of five rings.
Is this book i talked about it before on.
The channel it's written by an old.
Samurai.
How cool is that by the way uh.
It's super interesting let's see if we.
Can show it.
It's very short but i really recommend.
It and there's strategy in it that.
Strategy of the samurai yeah musashi.
Can you guys see this.
So i have the the ground book the water.
Book the fire book the win book.
Let's see if i remember son.
Oh yeah that was about school and stuff.
Like that i remember.
Let's do the fire book no.
Off i own the book.
It is difficult to move strong things by.
Pushing directly.
So you should injure the corners.
You must study this yeah he always says.
That here so you must research it deeply.
He always that's it's so funny this.
Happens when you injure the corner of.
His body.
And this weakens him it is important to.
Know how to do this.
So you must research it deeply.
Music.
Some something something something.
Simultaneously with flourishing the long.
Sword.
We shout during the fight to get into.
Rhythm research this.
Deeply you must understand this.
What is meant by mingling it's a spirit.
Of advancing and becoming engaged with.
The enemy.
And not withdrawing even one step you.
Must understand this.
It is necessary to consider how to renew.
Also applies in large-scale strategy.
Research this diligently.
Oh i gotta reread it so fun.
Anyway back to the game.
If you've never read a book in a long.
Time and you're genuinely interested and.
Interested it's a really fun one to just.
Dive into.
Musashi's martial arts nitenichi.
Nitanichi.
Is still taught in dojo no way.
How old is the book i should say in the.
Beginning right.
In 1573.
No way that's oda.
Naga.
It's just so cool to get these this is.
Why i love literature.
No other medium can trans.
Transport you in time like them.
The way of the sword is the moral.
Teaching of the samurai.
Fostered by the confucianist philosophy.
We shape the tokugawa system.
Together with the native shinto religion.
Of japan.
From the kamakura period the muromachi.
Period the wars.
Court of japan encouraged the austere.
Zen study among the samurai and zen went.
Hand in hand with the arts of war.
In zen there are no elaboration it aims.
Directly at the true nature of things.
There's no ceremonies no teaching the.
Prize of zen is essentially personal.
Makes sense are you guys bored.
You don't think it's interesting should.
We just read your book instead.
I'm gonna.
Me.
I said this before but i would love to.
Do a short story reading for our live.
Stream.
Have some music set the mood discuss it.
Afterwards could be fun.
I'm not walking the right way.
I have not been studying diligently.
I did not research it deeply.
He's under the bridge it's a troll under.
The bridge.
Foreign.
Guess i followed the woman.
We're just doing out here doing squats.
Funny hat it's not a funny hat it's cool.
Hat take that back.
Dominic.

Music.
Yeah i was thinking we could start with.
A horror story.
Because that's simple and anyone could.
Get into it and then i would love to do.
Borjes.
At some point i love his short stories.
But there might be a bit tough to start.
With seasons.
Deeply nice.
Music.

Sword.
The martial art something on b i forgot.
Or is it i already discovered this.
Supposed yeah we just need to find.
Another route.
Google maps check my google maps.
With my heart.
We probably just need to go around it.
Whoa we must study it more deeply.
There was something left of the fire.
Really.
Let's just try walking around it for now.
Nope that does not work.
No not bushy though.
Kendo that's right sorry my bad i don't.

Remember when i said we're not wasting.
Time today.
Music.
Come on it's part of the game it's part.
Of the fun.
It's what i was saying telling you guys.
Before the last live stream you gotta.
Enjoy the moment.
Oh my god.
If you just focus on doing one task.
After that another that's my way of.
Living.
That's not my kind of life.
I like how they incorporate in the game.
Because it totally fits with the samurai.
Philosophy at least i like to think so.
Let's follow the bird.
There's something happening but i'm.
Following the bird god damn.
It oh we got a hike here.
We can ride a a hiker.
Nice dude.
All right how does this work.
Reflect on fear yes.

Sides.
Guided by the night by night's glow.
Dude i love that.
That's so fun.
We got a headband.
That is such a great thing that they.
Added that.
Because that's what i was saying before.
Being samurai is more than just killing.
It's about the softness as well.
Soft and strong that's what i aspire to.
Be all right let's rescue the.
Hot stage.
Enough for this.
Music.
How you doing there next to the wall.
