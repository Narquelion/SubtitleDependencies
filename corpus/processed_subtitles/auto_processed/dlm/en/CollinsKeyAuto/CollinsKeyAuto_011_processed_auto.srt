Thumbs-up button show me some love i've.
Always watched american talent but never.
In a million years did i ever think that.
I would actually be on the show so to.
Actually be on the show this season is.
It's really a dream come true.
Because i something i've always kind of.
Wanted to do but the magic that i.
Perform is not really meant for.
America's got talent because more.
Close-up magic.
Whereas america's got talent usually all.
The big stage illusion so i thought i.
Was going to boot off the stage because.
The audience would be able to see the.
Close-up magic now i'm going to get a.
Couple axes and they get torn apart by.
The judges so that's why it was such a.
Shock when i got a scathing ovation and.
The judges had nothing but great things.
To say that is a love thing over there.
Whatever that is now we got some like.
Air conditioning finger just went off.
