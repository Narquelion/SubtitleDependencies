Everyone knows movie theater food is so.
Expensive one skittles.
What why we're gonna show you how to.
Sneak candy and snacks into the movies.
Without being caught but here's the.
Twist.
This is not your normal movie theater.
Security and each theater is equipped.
With the most insane security checkpoint.
That we're gonna have to try to get.
Through without being caught and by the.
End of the video whoever has the most.
Amount of candy confiscated they will be.
Ejected from the fever.
Literally the first feeder you're.
Sneaking candy into is protected by a.
Vicious guard dog and i want to sneak in.
As much candy as possible in these.
Skittles here.
You're the worst at opening bags to.
Sneak by candy and i have a genius way.
Of getting it inside these stuffed.
Animals what i've got a way better way.
To sneak it in devin i've got.
Oh bella are you kidding exactly so.
Belle you want to tell them our master.
Plan of how we're going to sneak you.
Down.
All right so i'm going to pretend that i.
Have a baby bump because i hear dogs are.
Very protective of pregnant women.
Back it up literally i'm going to have a.
Booty that's voluptuous.
What yeah i'm going to waddle right in.
There man dog won't even look he'll.
Sniff sniff.
Nothing to see here just a sweet booty.
You guys are insane that's.
Never gonna work but this is definitely.
Gonna work so first we gotta find the.
Perfect pregnancy belly for bella here.
So i think that was a nice shape and to.
All the stuffed animal lovers out there.
I'm sorry.
I actually needed to stay attached a.
Little bit but this is perfect not to.
One up you devin but it's all the.
Basketball lovers out there yeah i am.
Sorry.
Let's go all right here we go.
Oh my goodness i don't feel too good.
Right now.
I'm not as strong as i once was getting.
A little like bomb.
There we go it's now storm breaker mode.
So here we go three.
Two one two there we go that's what i'm.
Talking about so bella we are now.
In business come on over oh wow okay.
Thanks let's see will that work.
Hey there yeah i mean for a basketball.
It's relatively convincing so for mine i.
Just have to remove some of the stuffing.
So i can fit a ton of candy into here.
All right we've lined the inside of the.
Basketball with a whole bunch of rice.
Krispies treats that way the dog will.
Not be able to smell all the other candy.
How's the tiger going though it's going.
Great so now that i have it empty it's.
Time to fill it up with candy all right.
Well the next thing i got to figure out.
Is my booty.
And more importantly what i'm gonna put.
As my booty implants we'll try and.
Cantaloupe and this little thing it.
Gives me a little bit uneven but hey.
It's nature.
That's gonna go down your pants bro i.
Don't think so man i think i can get it.
Or here we go boom.
Haters gonna hate i think i'm a hater on.
This one how does it look.
Could that pass no no no no no.
Oh no all right guys i'm gonna go for.
The global booty right here so i think.
That this would be better.
Intergalactic right here i feel wrong.
Having to open the globe up this way.
Knowing where it's about to be but.
It just gotta go there we go i feel like.
This is one of the best halloween bags.
Ever so.
What are you doing there's a hole in my.
Booty all right.
I'm done i can't do this anymore so well.
It's been a pleasure.
What is so well you mean farewell i'm.
Confused.
All right but you know what though i.
Don't want to see candy until i'm back.
Sorry.
Welcome back the quantity of candy i am.
Putting in this thing.
Is insane i've already used half of my.
Table over here all right bella i'm.
Gonna try to take that belly to you so.
If you want to put it on for a second do.
It really fast yep three.
Oh snap that was good okay here we go.
This is the worst painting i got you.
Guys okay there we go.
This is so hard i don't want to get it.
Running out of tape i think i'm not.
Doing much to help this at all even.
Though this is like my diy oh my arms.
Stuck all right.
Part of my diy here we go okay my arm is.
Stuck.
All right well you know i think we.
Should find a better way of securing it.
Right now let's go try to sneak into the.
First movie theater this isn't.
Convincing.
Yeah this isn't gonna work bro we'll.
Clean it up the first thing we're.
Sneaking candy into is protected by a.
Vicious guard dog it's time to sneak.
Into the theater all right we were here.
To see.
What do you mean.
Sir i'm gonna start with you okay all.
Right yeah start okay tank's gonna have.
To sniff these stuffed animals okay.
Why well why is there so many dude what.
Are you doing why i got somebody's.
Stuffed animals going to a little movie.
Man what do you mean it's not a little.
Movie it's a scary movie.
I see i i'm with you on this one i think.
This is super suspicious.
He's gonna have to check those out for.
All right we're gonna want to take a.
Step back.
I'm looking at you i'm looking dead in.
Your eyes you might have candy in his.
Eyes.
Sir good job he's gonna have to sniff.
These stuffed animals.
Okay oh jesus oh okay then all right.
He's.
Oh.
So what are you expecting three weeks.
Three weeks she's.
Uh how many months 18. 18 months.
Pregnant this wow.
Fully developed brain is going to be.
Next level algebra out the gate.
If she can just go into the movies would.
Be great thank you so much.
A little funny could you take a little.
Turn around and do it slow for me all.
Right well let's just uh.
Do a little turn just a little wow oh.
Stop stop.
Right here that doesn't look natural.
That's what you call 15 squats a minute.
Man.
I think he needs to sniff your butt my.
Dude i'm just i'm with my body.
This can't be theater appropriate this.
Is outrageous.
This is outrageous yo give this video a.
Thumbs up if you also think that this.
No more questions thank you very much.
Bye tank all right cool let's.
Hop inside thank you hey we were able to.
Sneak the candy in theater number one.
But sneaking into theater number two is.
Gonna be way harder because it's guarded.
By the candy crushing car wash it's a.
Spinning nightmare designed to dislodge.
The candy and send it flying so right.
Now try to get devin and hide our candy.
For the next theater we're going to try.
To sneak in as.
Many gummy bears as we possibly can and.
The strategy on this one is to hide them.
In plain sight so i'm going to make arms.
And legs out of gums i'm going to make.
Gummy clothing so right now we're going.
To cut a little hole in the inside so i.
Got to get this over my head all right.
So i filled this.
Hand with some gummies trying to remove.
The plastic hand from it.
Here we go here's the hole let's see if.
We just try to this is so hard dude.
Trying to fit through this thing here we.
Go okay yeah all right here we go i'm in.
Okay.
Yeah oh hey here we go first part of the.
Gummy shirt is not what that doesn't.
Look very convincing i mean this doesn't.
Look like.
Like a shirt like fashion oh it's almost.
Yeah.
Oh dude why is it so floppy.
I feel violated all right so i got the.
Gummy hand now it's time for the gummy.
Leg all right did you do that time for.
Me to put over here we got oh whoa.
So i got this tube that's filled with.
Gummy and then i'm going to fill this.
With some candies now time to draw the.
Logo here we go get out of here.
Boom that's one g oh oh that actually.
Kind of worked fly.
You literally almost hit me it's a.
Little bit dirty but it works look at.
This.
He's a floppy man yeah there has no.
Bones.
Why do you do this to me every time add.
Them comment down below such like.
Not nice things all right don't comment.
Down below a floppy man he's.
He's not a floppy man all right time to.
Pack this in with some candy so it's not.
A floppy leg can you not do that like.
Directly in my ear do you like it as.
Much as his hands.
No you should slap me with it every time.
You have them comment down below.
Something that's not.
Super nice i get to slap you with this.
Hand devin is the most.
Wonderful brother of all time who.
Doesn't hold me hostage he's.
Amazing i don't like that hand do you.
Know this i'll put it back okay for now.
All right so my gummy shirt is almost.
Done once i'm done filling up this leg.
I'll have one gummy leg some gummy shoes.
And one gummy arm yep and then it's time.
To see if we can sneak through the candy.
Crushing car wash dude this shirt is so.
Sticky there's no one around this car.
All right wait wait wait right there.
Boys what i'll be taking care of things.
Here from now on oh.

Two feet down now you hold on to the.
Patented gripper well i'm way too cool.

Crossed.
I would prefer sir if you put both.
Regular sized and colored hands.
On the stick there definitely i'm glad.
You pointed that out but.
My hand did fall asleep on the way here.
That's why it's blue oh wrapping them.
Together that wakes them up.
I'm sorry it hurts too much do you want.
Me to do no no no no no no no i'm good.
He's clapping together no what do i do.
All right no no it's already working.
