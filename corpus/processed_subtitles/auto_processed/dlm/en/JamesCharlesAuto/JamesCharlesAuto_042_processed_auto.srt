Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel for.
Today's video i'm very excited because.
We're doing a trend that has been going.
Around honestly quite a lot on youtube.
Recently and not is the damming a bunch.
Of celebrities challenge basically.
Creators are reaching out to different.
Celebrities and sending the messages.
Seeing if the respond or asking.
Questions or in my case for today asking.
Them to be a part of my makeup routine.
Now i just want to give a quick shout.
Out to soft as nails and sylvia ghani.
Because they already did this before me.
But i thought it'd be really fun to try.
To do it myself and a bunch of different.
People who've actually reached out to me.
For this challenge which is very very.
Strange but also very very cool at the.
Same time i used to make jokes my.
Friends about being famous clearly they.
Did not go over too well but for today's.
Video we're gonna be damming some real.
Celebrities and seeing if they want to.
Be a part of my makeup routine.
Music.
Alright you guys let's just jump right.
Into everything i have my instagram dms.
And open and were just gonna start.
Setting some messages and see what.
Happened so the first step of my makeup.
Routine is obviously going to be a.
Primer so i feel like i wanted a i'm at.
Some different celebrities that have a.
Really really beautiful skin and the.
First person that comes to mind is miss.
Bella hadid so i'm going to send her a.
And sorrenti m little but i lost and her.
On july 1st and said did you just hand.
The plane to we're actually on a flight.
Taylor from new york to la and we were.
Both running late for meetings and we.
Both did our makeup on the plane.
It was low-key kind of iconic i mean.
Obviously how to each other but she did.
Not see my dm so let's see if she sees.
This one.
So after primer cross foundation and you.
Guys know i definitely love a full.
Covered and makeup look so i definitely.
Want to reach out to somebody who like.
Also is always painted every time so the.
First one that comes to mind is a sister.
Cardi b her makeup artist erica is so.
Freaking talented so i think she'll have.
A good one one day she'll send okay the.
Last person that i want to jam for.
Foundation is probably like the longest.
Shot from happening in this entire video.
But there's a slight chance and that is.
Queen living legend herself.
Rihanna because she does not fancy.
Beauty she has her own foundation it's a.
Really really bomb so lost hi queen.
Little queen hope you're doing well i'm.
So excited for all of the new pieces.
From the affinity collection do you want.
To participate and recommend a.
Foundation or me it's who use winky face.
Because she's a businesswoman and i know.
She'll see this marketing opportunity.
Other foundation comes concealer so i.
Shake the perfect person to reach out to.
For this as isis terrorists are a larson.
She is so beautiful and yes we did have.
A beef beforehand but we've deemed we've.
Popped it out and now we are good.
Sisters and i feel like she will come.
Through it with a good and fresh.
Suggestion let's see if sisters are not.
Replies now after concealer from mia.
Come setting powder and obviously the.
Whole point of powder is to lock your.
Face in place so it lasts all day long.
And when i think a setting powder i.
Definitely think i want to dm at camp a.
Trust because she's literally one my.
Favorite artist of all time right now.
And i have seen her alive and she goes.
Crazy she is so insanely talented and.
That means her makeup artist has to.
Really lock her face in please so i feel.
Like she might have a really good.
Suggestion.
I literally obsessed with her and we've.
Dammed back and forth a few different.
Times so hopefully she replies next.
Comes a bronzer and contouring that.
Obviously means somebody who is chiseled.
Who was beautiful and in the sun so i.
Think we should go ahead and dm camilla.
Kibeho.
She's a lime queen it's so crazy because.
The first time i ever him back to me.
Like a pea was outside of an ariana.
Grande concert weirdly enough i was.
Going in and she was coming out and i.
Was like running and she literally was.
Like oh my god it's not james and i.
Turned around and i was like and it was.
Like the crazies interacted my entire.
Life because i literally was obsessed.
With her and her music and her voice and.
Whole i still remember it like it was.
Literally yesterday we took a selfie.
Together and i've loved her ever since.
It is so cool to see her blow up so.
Hopefully she replies and to suggest i.
Bronzer okay you guys so the next intro.
Routine is going to be blush and i feel.
Like blush is a very like innocent cute.
Youthful timid makeup product so when i.
Think of that i think of million bobby.
At brown and obviously on stranger.
Things eleven does not work too much.
Makeup but when she walks the red carpet.
Millie always looks so beautiful so she.
Might have a great suggestion once i.
Blush this on i always go ahead and bake.
But we already have our sister setting.
Powder so the next that was going to be.
Our brows and when i think of like.
Really beautiful structure at brows one.
Of the first people that comes to mind.
Is sister at madison birra because she.
Always.
Literally perfect i don't even.
Understand how one human being can look.
Like that but she might have a good.
Suggestion sent to madison beer after.
Eyebrows are slated in place the next.
Epic waymaker protein is always a shadow.
And when i think of iconic red carpet i.
Said it looks that i've literally.
Changed industry let's be real the first.
Person to come to mind is miss kim.
Kardashian-west her makeup artist mario.
And her have created so many iconic.
Looks together and cameras always buy at.
Such an amazing friend and role model to.
Me so let's see what she has to suggest.
Hi mom hope you're doing well and the.
Reaction to the new collection has been.
Amazing you might want smoking like.
Chronic look so up maybe i can create an.
Iconic one with your suggestion well.
Matt's the beard santa t okay so the.
Positive thought to give me more details.
What you mean oops i said grow products.
Music.
Myself brow products let's do a dessert.
Than that let's let's let's see what.
Let's see what she suggests let's see.
What let's see what she let's see what.
She suggests another person that always.
Has iconic eyeshadow looks has got to be.
Queen and lady gaga i don't think she'll.
Answer i've never gotten to meet her.
Before but i want to literally so so.
Badly.
Lady gaga inspired me so much as a kid.
And truly was somebody who like made me.
Feel like it was a paid to be myself i.
Love her hopefully one day i will be.
Able to give her a hug and to say thank.
You for everything she has done also she.
Just announced her new makeup line a.
House laboratories i already pre-ordered.
The entire thing so if you guys want to.
Review when that comes out definitely.
Let me know but let's see she has an.
Eyeshadow recommendation after i said it.
Always comes mascara and the person that.
I absolutely 100% want to damn for this.
Is queen paris hilton.
Because i feel like she always has a.
Beautiful stunning lash on so i think.
She definitely has to have it.
Good at recommendation hi queen hold.
Your wow i'm gonna imagine a video of me.
In paris hilton like that be everything.
To me just like oh oh give anything to.
Film with her i feel like it would be.
It's so iconic imagine like i become.
Paris hilton sugar baby for a day oh.
That's a good one that is a good one you.
Guys if you want to see me in paris glam.
Together love me now that would be so.
Hot autumn eyeshadow and lashes are all.
On the next step of my makeup routine is.
Always high later when i think of a.
Highlighter the absolute first person.
That comes to mind is jlo she literally.
Revolutionized highlighter and just.
Going from within i've met her a person.
Before she is literally the most perfect.
Looking human being you could ever.
Imagine in your entire life she and.
A-rod told me that their daughters were.
In fact sisters so hello you guys if.
You're watching the video and love me.
The most cannot wait to meet you.
Sometime very very soon oh i hope she.
Replies now just in case jlo doesn't see.
It because she's obviously busy with her.
Show right now i want to do one other.
Person for highlighter and i think we.
Need a boy and this here's somewhere.
Hello i've avoided makeup and i have not.
Damned a single boy yet oh my god let's.
Do troye sivan he's literally killing it.
In the musical right now and he started.
On youtube so hopefully he will.
Appreciate the effort going into this.
Video and will definitely reply let me.
Write to him after her that her next.
Voice comes my lips and of course we.
Have the perfect person to diana for a.
Lip suggested that as queen kylie jenner.
Herself and venture of the kylie lip kit.
She thought it has every shade you could.
Possibly imagine so i know still have a.
Good suggestion and last but finally not.
Least we have settings ready to walk my.
Face in place all day long and for this.
Step i wanted am probably the most.
Famous person on the entire planet right.
Now and that is a lil nos ex who better.
To suggest the settings pray and then.
Him it because if he's taking his horses.
To the old town road i feel like horse.
Riding is like a very or rigorous sports.
So he's got her know how to keep the.
Makeup on all day long i feel like i.
Want to do one last person for settings.
Bright and i think i need to do someone.
That like knows beauty at least a little.
Bit oh.
Oh shame it all hiya sister say.
Congratulations your pregnancy first of.
All that baby is literally going to be.
The most beautiful child probably ever.
In the entire world.
Y'all better watch out she's coming oh.
My god i could not even believe that i.
Would forget this but we need to do our.
King shawn mendes hello shawn and i have.
Dan back and forth on twitter and we.
Also matt the mikela for the first time.
And he was literally the nicest ever i.
Was so nervous to be there like you guys.
Have no idea but he gave me such an.
Amazing pep talk it was just really a.
Really dope and down to earth we took a.
Selfie together but we've never talked.
To her instagram dm so i'm hoping that.
He sees this and will reply it later on.
All right you guys that i think that is.
Pretty much every single step of a.
Makeup routine obviously we have to wait.
For people to reply a few people have.
Already started answering which is so so.
Cool but i'm gonna go ahead and head to.
A few meetings right now and get dinner.
Later on and then we'll check back in.
With you guys later on tonight and we.
Will get glamp hopefully with.
Everybody's suggestions all right you.
Guys hello a good morning we were back.
In the sister studio i just got back.
Super super late last night from a long.
Weekend with the family over the long.
Weekend long this party up in lake.
Havasu we got quite a lot of responses.
First today's video probably through my.
Fear of celebrities and i'm so excited.
So let's just dive right in all right.
You guys so obviously you know what the.
First seven every makeup routine is.
Always going to be a primer and we.
Reached out to quite a few different.
People that have hash tag skin goals for.
Primer and after five days unfortunately.
None of them replied so this video is.
Off to a really really good start but i.
Will say obviously they're all very very.
Busy and out of all the makeup steps.
This is the only one that didn't get a.
Response and i didn't even used to use.
Primer beforehand so i feel like we can.
Definitely go ahead and skip it and move.
Right on to foundation and this step was.
Actually not looking too promising in.
The whole response.
Department either and tolle i was in the.
Shower singing and performing my concert.
As usual line anyway business you don't.
Get his sister squeaky clean and ready.
For this video today until they heard my.
Phone ding and it was it ben sarah.
Notification and i opened the shower.
Door dripping wet and i glanced over at.
My phone and you know who's came almost.
Rihanna bad girl riri ceo affinity.
Beauty and the most paid.
Entertainer in the world sent me a.
Message and i literally had never found.
Gold harder and my entire life i'm sure.
You guys can already guess what she.
Recommended but to steer employed and.
She said i'm so honored and grateful but.
You already know you got to use the pro.
Filter foundation that started all off.
Right thank you.
You guys heard it right here for the.
Queen herself and if you guys know if.
You've had a long time sister subscriber.
When i first tried the fendi foundation.
I really really did not like it but.
After trying a few more times i fell in.
Love with the formula i have a few.
Different shades that matched me very.
Very well but since i got tan at the.
Lake i did go ahead and pick up a few at.
Different shape to try out 190 185 and.
210 it's let's go ahead and get our base.
On and find this is that oh my god this.
Is too late for me i never thought this.
Day would come where i actually got tan.
And my foundation is too light this is a.
Plot twist y'all didn't expect we're.
Just gonna blend our pro filter all over.
And get some good full coverage as usual.
A but quite a lot of like a sunburn and.
A sunspots that i need to cover up so.
This be the perfect foundation and base.
To do so okay you guys so for concealer.
Idm does zara larsson and she actually.
Replied so quickly that i didn't even.
Need it three times to anybody else.
Which i love we love a girl who's on top.
Of her social media and she said hi babe.
That's so fine the for sure easy.
Question it's definitely make up reverse.
Full cover extreme at camouflage haha.
What flaws okay we love a full coverage.
Queen work i have a lot of red marks.
From acne singing and i get black.
Readers under my eyes because i never.
Sleep this one is magic okay great we.
Picked it up today and i cannot wait to.
See how this one works.
I'm just gonna put some on the back of.
My hand wow.
This is very very thick then it's gonna.
Put it in using my morphe sponge as.
Usual oh my god zara was not kidding.
When she said this concealer was full.
Coverage literally holy crap okay.
Low-key high key middle key is a.
Concealer combo looks so good right now.
It is not even finding.
I'm like obsessed with all the slugs.
This is the most full coverage i think.
I've ever been but i'm really not mad.
About it before i go in and get creasy.
Let's move on to our next step which is.
Going to be setting powder and the one.
Person that replied right away was my.
Queen.
Kemp hs oh my god i literally love her.
And i'm obsessed with her music kim said.
Sister of course i'm sister you the.
With the sauce definitely put the.
Benji beauty loose powder and butter.
Love you whoaaah and pass it on i.
Literally had to apply and say oh my god.
I love you so much because of that is.
Such a classic akin what type of.
Response and we have this right here a.
Lot of that fendi beauties already.
Getting two plugs in those videos today.
Let's go ahead and do as she says and.
Pack it on okay if this is not packed on.
I don't even know what packed on who.
Could possibly be my face feels so set.
And locked in place they all gotta go.
Ahead and brush the access away and then.
We'll be ready for the next step.
So this age does the game our makeup is.
Nice and said please but we're looking.
At very very flat so we're going to go.
Into our next step which is a bronzer i.
Originally d ended my friend and good.
Says iggy azalea about a primer she did.
Reply and she said that she does the new.
Primary she doesn't care because her.
Makeup routine is trash direct quote.
From her would i totally disagree good.
Because the rank-up always looks.
Literally perfect but regardless it.
Doesn't matter.
She recommended a bronzer and said it so.
For today we're gonna be using her.
Suggestion which is too late on de.
Chanel i've seen literally every single.
Beauty your ever in history uses bronzer.
But i never actually have so i was aided.
To try it out like step one into the.
Skin oh yeah that looks pretty okay.
Oh i now see why everyone's obsessed.
With this this looks so pretty.
Next thing when i add just a little bit.
More color using a little bit of a blush.
And for this i reached out to one person.
And one person only and that is because.
This person literally wrote back within.
Minutes the first time which is so so.
Cool and that is billy bobby brown also.
Known as 11 and changer things literally.
Is such an incredible child actress i.
Obviously love her and really recommend.
It at the charlotte tilbury blush and i.
Asked her any specific seed and she said.
No any one you want.
You look beautiful which is so so sweet.
I went to the sun picked up the.
Charlotte tilbury.
Cheek to cheek now if you've been around.
For a while you guys would know that.
Blush is kind of a newer step to a.
Makeup routine now i will say i was a.
Little nervous at the charlotte tilbury.
Counter because their blush range is a.
Little questionable.
I'm not gonna lie the color that i.
Picked up tag is this this combination.
Was the only one that i thought i could.
Maybe make work so i'm just gonna go in.
And apply it very very lightly you know.
I feel like when you're somebody like.
Billy bobby brown who's like actually.
Perfect already at age 15 it's really.
Hard to make her look bad right but me.
On the other hand it's not hard so i'm.
Gonna apply a very tiny little bit of.
This and hope to god that it doesn't.
Ruin my entire makeup look okay that's.
Not bad at all i was a little scared.
There first i kind of not gonna lie but.
I like how this looks before i move on.
To the next time i'm just gonna really.
Quickly got a little bit more of that.
Pentium beauty loose powder and butter.
And it like my girl kim pedro said i'm.
Really pack it on and just do a little.
Bit of baking all right you guys well my.
Face is basically in place i'm gonna.
Move on to the next step which is going.
To be eyebrows and i want to reach out.
To somebody who i know always has.
Perfect eyebrows and that is madison.
Beer and my good says came through with.
The recommendation she said hi sister i.
Would love to but give me more details.
Haha what do you mean grow products and.
In this moment i realized i spelled a.
Brow as growl instead so what a correct.
Way so she said anastacio always a brow.
Pencil and medium brown which is.
Actually the literal exact color that i.
Even used so this is obviously perfect.
Thank you so much madison i love it the.
Absolute most you guys aren't gonna.
Gonna do my brows on camera quickly and.
I'll be right back.
To show off my eyes already you guys we.
Are both eyebrows are slain and ready to.
Go thank you once again it's about us.
And beer if the recommendation on.
Estancia literally it never lets us down.
And now it is time to play with some.
Eyeshadow i have a few different people.
That have never been afraid to rock a.
Crazy look on the red carpet obviously.
You guys know i love a.
Outside-of-the-box makeup look we don't.
Exactly do a neutral glam very often on.
This youtube channel and the first.
Person to reply it was none other than.
The living legend my own mother kim.
Kardashian-west.
Literally within at 4 minutes actually.
Be sending her to yama icon and she said.
For sure so fun.
Did you see the tutorial opening i.
Posted on instagram.
Was annoying me trying to take over so i.
Started tutorial and said hi sister hey.
Sister i said i know i tweeted saying.
That you're coming from my brand i love.
You guys so much let me know what.
Palette to use and she said one of your.
Palettes and i said no literally any pal.
And she said oh then duh one of mine it.
Expect nothing less the kardashians are.
Obviously at marketing queens and she.
Says let's do this so my era palette.
Which i was so stated for because i just.
Got the pr package in the mail literally.
Yesterday and i think this packaging is.
So cool i actually texted him about a.
Few days prior because if we open up.
This pr package we have the so fired.
Palette which we're going to use in the.
Studio in a second beautiful glosses.
Some liner but we also have these big.
Matches which are actually included i.
Just got a splinter hi i'd like to file.
A lawsuit against kim kardashian well.
Which are actually included because the.
Side of the pierre box can light a match.
Is that not literally the craziest.
Packaging you've ever seen this is so.
Friggin cool hopefully the sisters to do.
Does not burn down but kudos to camp.
Because that is innovation alright you.
Guys this is pretty much the sapphire.
Palette color scheme up right here it.
Isn't so pretty kind of simple i'm gonna.
Zoom you guys and i already have a look.
At mine that i want to do so i'm just.
Going to it throw that to kind of go a.
Little bit fast because we still have a.
Lot of other steps to do i'm first just.
Taking this dark maroonish brown color.
And stamping it into my outer-v.
Using a marquee i'm about four five six.
So with it i'm four three three of.
Grabbing the terracotta shade from the.
Palette and buffing right over top of.
13 and dipping.
Into that light brown kind of.
Transitional color i'm just going to.
Very lightly buff out that top edge i'm.
Gonna do a soft cut crease using the.
Gold shade in the bottom corner i'm.
Gonna add a little bit of y by using an.
Angled brush and the dark moon shade it.
From the palette once again.
Alright you guys that it's already one.
Eye using the soulfire palette all.
Complete i think it looks so setting in.
Definitely reminds me of the campfire.
I'm gonna go and do the other one off.
Camera quickly and i'll be right back to.
Do it the next step alright you guys.
Know that eyes are all done it is time.
For our next step which is going to be.
It lashes now in the beginning of this.
Video when i was jamming people i said.
That i really wanted someone who was.
Always super super painted the house.
Down so i could actually get like a good.
Last recommendation because there's a.
Good lash and there's like god lashes a.
Lot could really really.
Break a look so i went ahead and dm the.
First ever influencer the iconic woman.
Who started it all and that has paris.
Hilton and let me tell you she did not.
Dissipate at all.
Paris robot can set me at this video.
First magic must be able to be like i'll.
Give my favorite laster by me.
I heard mascaras also by me literal.
Goals hello i need that to be me you one.
Day like it's gonna happen putting out.
Into the universe right now anyway like.
I said it she did not disappoint.

Small little package on my front porch.
Of lashes and mascara but no it's pure.
Self that who's literally the queen of.
Extra and this is what i got literally.
Every single product you could ever.
Imagine i'm not even gonna lie i didn't.
Even know paris houston how to makeup.
Line but i'm not mad about it and cannot.
Wait to literally try all of this i'm.
Gonna go ahead and grab the lashes and.
Mascara and pop them on and try all this.
For later so this actually comes with.
Three different mascaras to choose from.

Curling mascara for this i think i'm.
Gonna grab the lengthening mascara since.
We are gonna be applying a pair of a.
Falsies overtalk it's gonna apply a call.
To this to what my lashes i just relized.
This box literally says lashes that.
Speak louder than words honestly can't.
Write you a thought that's hot.

For the next step which is of course.
Going to be highlighter it is time to.
Get our glow on and be a sister shiny to.

As well because he actually recommended.
The glossy a nice shine highlighter and.
I've never actually tried any glossy.
Products before i've been wanting to for.
A very very long time so i'm super.
Pumped to test this out.

Pretty of rose gold e-type color it is a.
Cream so i'm just going to oh wow.
Oh my god that is so bright looks so.
Pretty.
Did you see my ring finger for a nice.
Light touch ten little bit on the nose.
We are almost the end of this look you.
Guys we've sought to tie the entire look.
Together by adding one last thing and.
That is the d lipid e doodahs and who.
Better to ask for her lips suggest and.
Then the queen of lips herself literally.
Revolutionized lips in the makeup.
Industry and that is a kylie jenner.
Kylie replied and said ah yes are you.
Feeling a crazy color or totally up to.
Me and i said it literally pick whatever.
Color you want and she simply said i'm.
Sending you stuff now no i literally got.
That damn from kylie as i was leaving my.
House on the way to vacation so i spent.
The entire weekend having absolutely no.
Idea what i was gonna end up with on my.
Lips but when i got home uh surely.
Enough there was a bag on my front porch.
Labeled james charles with some kylie.
Products in it and hopefully this look.
Combo will match this look perfectly we.
Have a snow way bae kylie jenner matte.
Liquid lipstick and lip liner we also.
Have a kylie lip liner in the shade.
Coconut and a lipstick in the shade it.
Snatched let's see what we got oh i.
Think coconut is gonna be a really good.
Color with this yes okay.
Let's hope snatch is a good lip to go on.
Top well it's literally like she knew.
What the look was gonna be before it.
Even happened and last but finally not.
Least the ultimate step of the makeup.
Routine is going to be our a setting.

Only step of the routine that we had two.
Different people reply for little lost.

Busy writing has a 57th.
Ulta the rotary works and getting ready.
To release it by the way its treatment.
