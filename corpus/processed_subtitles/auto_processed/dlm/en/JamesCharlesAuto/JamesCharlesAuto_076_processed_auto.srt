I know this is the club y'all never.
Thought you'd see coming i didn't think.
I'd ever be in this room again.
I feel really good i missed you welcome.
Back it's been a really long time emma.
And i recently reconnected after i think.
Like two years absolutely insane we've.
Been texting back and forth hanging out.
A few times behind the scenes as well.
A lot can happen over the course of two.
Years and you know it's been really.
Amazing just catching back up and really.
Like being in each other's lives again.
And i'm definitely happy.
To have you back oh thank you for having.
Me back no it's been really fun i'm glad.
That i can now like add another friend.
To my like list of.
Two out of boxes right now totally we.
Get to catch up like we.
Lived a whole different life yeah and.
Then we come back and then we get to.
Like.
Talk about it all i know it's actually.
So crazy to think about i mean i've.
Obviously written all friendship in.
Private and now that we've had a lot of.
Time to just hang out and catch up we.
Figured okay we started online.
Might as well bring it back to online.
And give y'all a collaboration that.
You've been asking for for a very long.
Time we're trying to think what would.
Really.
Make sense right and you guys know i've.
Been trying really hard to step up my.
Fashion game looks like my instagram has.
Definitely improved since you knew me.
Last for sure sure no more adidas track.
Pants and sisters merch every single day.
Although you are hey and i figured if.
There's anybody that i think really has.
Their fashion game together.
It is miss emma chamberlain do you know.
How much of a compliment that is to me.
Because.
I always felt like you were 10 steps.
Ahead in that area and the fact that.
You're in fashion.
You just have your together and so the.
Fact that you're coming to me for.
Anything like i feel.
Really powerful i feel like me and james.
Have such different styles like you're.
Kind of like the ig baddie of it all.
Yeah and i'm kind of like the um i.
Listen to tyler creator like in the.
Shower.
Crying vibe and like i want to see james.
In that.
I'm gonna let emma style me for the week.
Now she already went through and picked.
Out a ton of different outfits.
I did okay so basically i connected with.
His stylist we spent a lot of time we.
Made movie boards.
She went shopping i haven't seen.
Anything yet either.
No nothing and i picked out a few things.
That i think he's gonna.
Hate hey two of them i think you're.
Gonna like but two of them i'm.
Really iffy like i think you're you're.
Gonna want to punch me in the face i'm.
Not.
Scared me either nervous sure okay.
Like i feel like when people go whatever.
I'm not gonna explain let's just go see.
Bye.
Music.
Like the ones that i feel like maybe are.
Weaker anyway.
Close your eyeballs okay that's a nice.
Layout.
I know it's kind of hot right okay this.
Is.
Something that i would wear like if this.
Was in my closet like i'd be wearing it.
Right now.
And i think you're really gonna love the.
Jacket and there's some really cute like.
Little black accents and i think that.
It's really cute and open your eyes.
Oh this oh this is good.
This is so cute it's really cute i'm.
Obsessed with it.
This is a really good look thank you yes.
Okay great it's only gonna get worse.
From here this is the best one.
So let's just ah okay.
Oh my god that was awesome i missed it.
So much.
Okay he's gonna hate this i'm sorry why.
Do you think we're gonna hate this one.
It's just very like.
How would you guys experience it might.
Smoke oh yeah yeah definitely like.
Stoner vibes from this.
Possibly it like sits in parks and like.
Buys hummus and just like.
But not for you no well it is for you.
This week james are you gonna trust me.
I'm gonna have no choice this one johnny.
Okay i'm gonna revive you a little bit.
James because i feel like.
That last one really got you emotional.
Scared and worried.
Yeah james this next outfit i think.
You're gonna love because this one was.
Very bella.
Need inspired three which she's just.
Like the hottest so i agree.
It's like stylish but also kind of hot.
Because of the shortest look.
Okay oh yeah i like it yes.
Yeah this is good oh my god the matching.
Glasses too i really like that.
I love it too yes yes i just want to.
Come here and steal james's things.
He hates the sweater i mean if he liked.
Every outfit it would be too fun of a.
Video.
Okay you have to picture it on this is.
The thing about mine it's all about the.
Way you wear it.
I can guarantee that you like this one.
Without going to a really important.
Business dinner and being like.
Look at my collared shirt i hate pink.
Thank you.
Listen you're gonna have two really good.
Days and two kind of.
Bad days but i think that you might be.
Impressed once you put the outfit on and.
You kind of put it on your body and you.
Like look in the mirror and you do a.
Little bit of this there's also one more.
Day of the week you guys can say we only.
So good news for friday i decided to.
Surprise you so we have an outfit for.
You but you're not allowed to see it.
Until friday.
So what everyone's looking at me with.
Suspicious faces.
No emma i'm pleasantly surprised.
With the selections this one better than.
I anticipated and i think i can make all.
Of these work.
Great except maybe the green one just.
Get in it's monday.
You have to start today get the green.
One.
Music.
And then i won't be around when he wears.
The rest of them because me and james.
Although we're friends again i don't.
Think we could spend a week with each.
Other.
Yeah we're working back up to there.
Right we're getting there for sure just.
Give us like a month.
Music.
Um.
I do kind of love it but it's also so.
Weird.
James i've never seen you in an outfit.
Like this in my life and it's so.
Confusing.
I think we did everything enough like.
This again without an old man's shoe.
Right or an ammo shoe i just think the.
Green.
And that shoe just gives me very like.
Clouds.
Listen this is my fault i do love the.
Set on you and i just think that the.
Dogs would be better.
Give it a try okay wait oh this is so.
Much better.
Oh that is better that is so much cooler.
That is definitely better.
It was just the shoes okay it was just.
The shoes.
No no it was just okay but like for.
The rest of the week things are only.
Going to go from here and i'm excited to.
See what happens this is true.
I can't wait to see it on social media.
While i'm laying in bed you're just like.
I'll make sure to send you lots of.
Photos and see you on friday for the.
Final look.
And for our grand reveal yes love you.
Kitty girl okay you guys just letting.
Everybody know i'm officially a vlogger.
Now i got a canon g7x camera which is.
One that everybody uses i'm currently in.
My emma.
Chamberlain styled outfit for day number.
One it is this green.
Checkered look as i've had it on for.
Longer it is growing on me a little bit.
It's definitely like not something that.
I would normally put myself in but i.
Feel like the whole point of this video.
In the first place was to get me out of.
My comfort zone and put me in a fun and.
Fresh outfit and i feel like she.
Definitely succeeded sorry i'm moving.
The camera a little everywhere this is.
Why i'm not good at vlogging anyway.
Trevor loves alfred coffee it is his.
Favorite place in the entire world.
I am going to be wearing these all day.
Long so i figured might as well join at.
Trevor anthony on their alfred's trip.
What are you guys doing.
Oh my god.
Music.
This is so gay it's actually like bad.
Hopefully emily doesn't mind that i.
Added a black mask.
To this look although it does definitely.
Match with the boots.
So it is time to go get some coffee.
How do you like what what i will never.
Understand like people like vlogging.
Like what am i even supposed to be.
Saying right now or do it.
Okay so i just got it okay you guys.
We're crossing the street.
Walking right across right now just.
Walking taking a step left but right.
Foot left foot right.
Left foot right side we're approaching.

Background very industrial very la vibe.
I think this is the very emma location.
Oh.
Sure miss emma oh.
Oh period a legs.
So fun james you should start doing this.
More.
Always giving back oh that's so good.
It's an in-motion photo.
That's famous if you but it's okay i.
Will absolutely facetune it for you.
Okay guys the coffee runs over.
It's like okay i don't know if i'm.
Feeling the oatmeal fantasy honestly.
Really is this your first time um it's.
Leaving a weird film in my throat.
Okay i don't know what to say bye.
Applause.
I feel exposed good morning everybody.
It's tuesday day number two.
Don't ever show that on camera yesterday.
We had the green checkered outfit on.
I figured today i would do my second.
Least favorite of the outfits which is.
The pink and red stripes just to get it.
Over with we don't have too much weight.
On today i was actually supposed to be.
On set for a very exciting project today.
Which would have been fun.
But it got cancelled which is sad but.
Now less people have to see me in the.
Look.
That's kind of mean that is me emma did.
A beautiful job it's just not exactly my.
Style we're gonna try it on anyway so.
Let's.
Get started.
Whoa oh she didn't take it out that.
Juicy dump truck oh no.
Oh yeah oh my god these are the tightest.
Ones i've ever put on.
Pushed it out look at my body it's all.
About the angle ladies.
But this um we can definitely return if.
We keep the tag on it was.
Kind of expensive i felt bad buying it.
How much was.
How much was that with tax well a little.
Under 400.
We can keep the tag on that's why i'm.
Great oh my god this.
Is so emma emma would look so good in.
This.
The pants are just not fitting very well.
And that's not emma's fault.
My own fault for just having a juicy.
Okay let's go take a photo shoot sure.
So we decided to all take a family trip.
Down to melrose and since.
You know obviously i'm in this pink and.
White outfit today and i am feeling like.
A very basic la white girl so i figured.
Why not just take it a step further and.
Match my pink outfit.
To the famous l.a pink wall this wall.
Radiates heat gorge.
Music.
I'm trying to be a good vlogger it's.
Literally 104 degrees outside.
Disgusting disgusting we wanted to go.
Shopping and then we decided actually we.
Don't want to go shopping it's not even.
Keep focusing.
Disgusting disgusting i'm gonna put me.
In a wool sweater it's okay though it's.
Honestly growing on me a little bit but.
You know what's not growing on me.
This heat so we're going hey.
I hate vlogging this is too hard.
Applause.
Good morning sisters it is wednesday aka.
Day number three of this emma styling.
Series today's gonna actually be a.
Really really big day i have a very.
Special video that i have to film.
And then also a business dinner tonight.
And i think for today's look i want to.
Go with.
The white racing one that literally.
Everyone loved including.
Me because i'm filming it's important to.
Me that the outfit i'm in is like true.
To my.
Normal brand i guess and then for dinner.
Tonight there's a chance that we could.
Get paparazzi.
So this is the look okay you guys so.
This is the full look all completely.
Honestly obsessed i think this looks so.
So.
Cute this look is it however the fit.
Is it's oh there you go i'm.
Not sure what size.
Pants miss emma thought that i was.
They're good around the waist but like.
It's producing a little bit of the.
Muffin top which is you know it's fine.
Everybody has one.
Like really have to accentuate some.
Angles here the jacket however i'm.
Literally obsessed with this outfit i.
Think looks.
So good and i can see myself reusing.
This in future looks as well so.
I'm ready for the day and hopefully i.
Get caught because i'm ready for.
Oh wow oh my god.
Hello hi you guys i know you have not.
Seen me since this morning.
Um if i'm going to be honest with you i.
Have not filmed anything.
For the video today in my outfit.
Although it was super super cute.
Because i'm going to be real um today.
Sucked i don't know how else to put it.
Or like what else to say or i don't want.
To show.
You anything of course that happens to.
Everybody but i'm just like.
So sad and confused had our filming this.
Morning and it was.
Terrible um the video was definitely.
Going to be scrapped which is.
Very disappointing and weird because.
That doesn't happen very often so i've.
Been in my head about that.
All day long and then i had a business.
Dinner tonight which did go well.
But as soon as we got to the restaurant.
And walked in with my cute outfit which.
I was excited to show you guys.
They literally took our phones and were.
Like hey we're gonna need to put a.
Sticker.
On your phone cameras because we have a.
No photo policy which is fine obviously.
I can definitely enjoy dinner without.
Having my phone.
But therefore this video with miss emma.
Which i've been very excited about.
I did not get any really great footage.
Today it's okay.
Obviously you know not every day can be.
An amazing one i'm gonna.
Get my outfit off unfortunately as cute.
As it is and get into bed and.
Hopefully wake up tomorrow to a way.
Better day love you guys.
Applause.
All right you guys hello good morning.

Start than yesterday it is a beautiful.
Brand new day and i am grateful to be.
Alive and here and we are sending.
