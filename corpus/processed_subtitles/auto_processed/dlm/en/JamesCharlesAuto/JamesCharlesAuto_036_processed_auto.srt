My sister's james charles here and.
Welcome back it's my youtube channel.
First today's the day we're doing that i.
Actually have not done in a very very.
Very long time and that is a review and.
It fills you guys who have been watching.
Me for a while you know that i don't.
Really like doing reviews but mostly.
Because of one they're boring - i don't.
Release which up my beauty routine that.
Often and three the general public is.
Convinced that beauty gurus are.
Literally spawns of satan and were sent.
Down to earth to literally fool.
Everybody and lied to them into buying.
Copy products a few days ago i was doing.
Some sisters shopping the play stylist.
Online to pick up some really cute.
Summer clothes and i was on asos which.
If you don't know what that is.
It is a really really cute online.
Clothing retailer how i can not.
Sponsored by shag should be and i.
Actually came across the beauty section.
On their website and found out something.
That had me shook to the core and that.
Was that.
Crayola the crayon company that we all.
Used to draw with when we were kids came.
Out with a full-on makeup line at first.
Sitting there i was very much sister.
Stumped on why the heck and our supplies.
Company would release a makeup line but.
Then i remembered it's kind of within.
The same realm and you guys just saw me.
Do my full face using only art supplies.
A few weeks ago and clearly the actual.
Products worked out pretty well so it.
Might not be that strange of a business.
Move for them but regardless i bought.
The entire collection today i'm very.
Very very excited to see how these.
Products actually test out will they be.
Good or will they literally be like.
Crayons on my face we're gonna find out.
So without further ado let's jump right.
Into the video.
Music.
So lonely isotopes that need to search.
Up crayola and it listed that they.
Launched 57 different items at the.
Collection which is actually like very.
Very large i definitely picked up a lot.
Of different things today that i'm.
Excited to try out and there are things.
On this website ranging from brushes to.
Eyeshadow palettes to mascaras to.
Highlighters to face crayons which i'm.
Have no idea what that a is but i guess.
We're going to find out so starting off.
I picked up two different eyeshadow.
Palettes that they launched right off.
The bat i'm gonna say packaging.
Absolutely beautiful this rainbow moment.
Is so so so cute and i got the nude.
Eyeshadow palette and the mermaid.
Eyeshadow palette france if you're.
Watching this please stop releasing.
Mermaid and unicorn themed items we are.
All over it this has been a psa the.
Palette sweet offer $29.
And they come with ten shadows and each.
Kit meaning each shadow is $2.90 wow i.
Love being at the queen of math and.
They're actually both cruelty free and.
Vegan which is really really great i.
Also picked up the crayola face palette.
Which once again retails for $29 and.
Contains a ten different oh.
This is the face palette i really.
Thought this is gonna contain a.
Contouring color i've grabbed their.
Customizable lip palette which is $35.
And once again contains ten at different.
Shades perfect for mixing i am very very.
Excited to try this out later on i don't.
Know if i knew you guys know this or if.
Ever tried it but anasazi beverly hills.
Actually has a really really great.
Formula for they're customizable lip.
Palette so i'm gonna be very interested.
To see how this performs in comparison.
To that one i grabbed the highlighter.
Cran and the shade shimmering blush and.
This one was $17.50 which looks like.
This interesting i'm a little bit scared.
To put this over top of my foundation.
But we're gonna make it work hopefully i.
Grab two different mascaras and black.
And navy blue and these retail for $16.
But the years of the collection for me.
Went a little bit sister so good lord i.
Picked up some of the crayola face.
Crayons and i grabbed a yellow a block a.
White a mango color a blue of red and a.
Nude color just a try out different eye.
Looks today now these look great on the.
Website they retail for $14.50 now to me.
If this price hike seems a little bit.
High beginner you're only getting point.
Zero seven ounces of product for $14.50.
And i know for a fact that milk sells.
Their jumbo eye pencils for like six.
Dollars which is literally like the same.
Exact product hello i literally spent.
101 dollars and fifty cents on all seven.
Of these eye pencils and what i find.
Even more ridiculous is that you can.
Literally go to the craft store and buy.
A 96 packet of crayons which are.
Probably let's be honest the exact same.
Thing is this for nine dollars i got 96.
Crayons for nine dollars and i got seven.
Eye crayons for a hundred and $1.50.
Something does not add up here if you.
Ask me and finally my last purchase of.
This collection is probably the worst of.
All them being this crayola beauty make.
Up a brush set in case now when i saw.
This breast i online originally i was.
Like wow it's so cute look at this brush.
Keys are you kidding me at holographic.
Crayola gorge and then i bought it for.
$40 and i opened it up to fines.
This for eyeshadow brushes for quattro i.
Don't think so before we go ahead and.
Actually start my look today i thought.
We should do some sister swatches of the.
Different eye crayons because these are.
Really what i'm most excited to see and.
How the heck of these perform so it's.
Awkwar-- that the shade white okay so.
It's definitely a very very creamy.
Formula thank god it doesn't feel like.
An actual crayon on my arm we have the.
Shade dandelion so cute that these are.
Actually matching to the real names of.
The crayola pencils putting these on.
They actually feel kind of like oily to.
Apply i really thought that are gonna be.
A lot more like hard i definitely am.
Interested to see if these are going to.
Try it down because they definitely do.
It transfer as you can see it kind of.
Feels like you're playing a lip stick to.
Your arm whereas i felt like they were.
Gonna be a lot more dry next we have the.
Shade at mango tango okay i guess this.
One is a little bit sparkly that's kind.
Of pretty i doesn't wanna try to use.
That one as a blush next we have the.
Shade of red oh wow that you're kidding.
That was with literally zero pressure.
Yeah these are a really sister soft this.
Is like a lipstick wow that did not last.
Long this is a mess alright next i.
Picked up the shade and navy blue this.
One also has a little bit of sparkle to.
It as well that's a really pretty color.
Not gonna lie i wanna use on the lower.
Lash line i also picked up the shade.
Desert sand which is like a little nudie.
Color i would caught this for out the.
Waterline and this is really really.
Pretty and then finally of course i got.
Black but it's like the worst block that.
I've ever swatch in my entire life what.
Is that you think of all the colors the.
Block could be like the best one a tiny.
Thing okay i'm a little bit sister.
Spooked.
After these swatches but you know what i.
Want to see how this is gonna turn out.
Let's just jump right in i'm gonna first.
Grab the face palette because i'm.
Looking a little bit flat right now and.
I'm literally scared and i'm going to.
Attempt to contour somehow i'm first.
Gonna grab the blush brush from this.
Collection and grab i think this shade.
Or right over here and try to contour.
This let's see luckily there's a mirror.
In here which is actually really helpful.
It's not like bad it's just like not.
There i was definitely right in the.
Beginning when i said that this palette.
Ee does not have any contouring option.
Which is hello it's a face palette i'm.
Gonna grab my kat von d shade and light.
Palette and just contour that i'm gonna.
Go back to that in 30 seconds per blush.
And highlight and the full shebang okay.
We're back with our regularly scheduled.
Programming did you miss me you know you.
Did i'm gonna grab the blush brush once.
Again i'm gonna dip into this kind of.
Metallic e coral copper shade down here.
It actually.
Very very stunning i want to try to use.
This for at blush today so once again.
It's not showing up can you see that.
What's going on why is it not showing up.
With my face oh there it is okay it's.
There she's there she came to the party.
Oh i love that okay.
I feel like this blush shade is like.
Absolutely perfect for a really.
Beautiful bronze look for the summer.
Time to kind of transition your bronzer.
To your highlight i really actually like.
To shade a lot oh my god wow okay cool.
Great love that you guys i like to do a.
Highlighter early on as well so i'm.
Gonna go back into the shade in a short.
Second i want to lay down this.
Highlighter stick at the base first this.
Is in the shade shimmering blush and.
Once again i think this was $17.50 these.
Kind of remind me of like the milk.
Sticks and that it's barely there come.
On crayola this is like the texture of.
What i thought the face crayons were.
Gonna be like like this has that waxy.
Kind of more dry texture that i was.
Expecting and that does not look good.
It's actually picking up the foundation.
Underneath which is definitely not good.
Do it does not look good that is.
Canceled a million percent and said what.
I'm gonna do is give my face a light.
Spray of six plus just like i always do.
Before i apply my highlighter and i'm.
Gonna go my morphe ab.
501 brush and i'm gonna dip into this.
Shade right here in the face palette.
Which actually looks like a really.
Really pretty high later and let's try.
Out this instead okay not at that see.
That looks good great love that the true.
Test here is kenneth snatch a sister.
Schnoz let's see that is the baseball.
Complete we are chiseled out we added a.
Little bit of color and now we are.
Glowing from with ana i'm actually.
Really really loving how this is looking.
So far but i'm gonna bake my faces set.
It in place and i'll be right back a.
Little bit closer up to start off the.
Eyes okay.
Literally about a sword in the eyeshadow.
I am literally luck the pocket it's.
Literally flying apart oh you're kidding.
Okay this is just getting worse and.
Worse and worse for the second we're.
Gonna pretend like that shadow didn't.
Just fall out of the entire package good.
Lord i'm scared.
Okay let's freakin do this thing at this.
Point i'm gonna start off with the nude.
Eyeshadow palette which is literally.
Falling apart at its seams i think i.
Really want to keep with the theme that.
I have going on it's officially summer.
Time i know someone you guys are.
Graduating at congratulations by the way.
So before i even jump into the eyeshadow.
Palette i actually.
The yellow face cran and i think i want.
To pop this in the inner corners like a.
Little fun a pop of color and see how it.
Actually it turns out it's actually.
Showing up on the skin surprisingly i.
Guess i'm just gonna grab like a.
Blending brush and see if i can buff.
That out okay they do blend thank god oh.
Wait no they don't.
Okay so the cranes actually do blend out.
But it definitely loses like almost all.
Of its pigmentation when you blend it.
And it doesn't dry like it's still tacky.
Feeling this is not going well i'm gonna.
Put a little bit more on to bring some.
Of that color back similar to the.
Highlighter - it's actually taking off.
The foundation from underneath the.
Crayon it still looks fine oh my god you.
Guys can't even oh wow hashtag for cyril.
Problems when you buy two sets of a.
Camera and it still looks good so.
Looking at the newsprint looks like.
There are four matte shades and then six.
Different shimmer shades which is a very.
Very bad ratio there should never be.
More shimmer shades than matte sheets in.
A palette i want to grab that red crayon.
That literally melts it off when it was.
Touching my hand and see if one eye can.
Create an orange in the middle of this.
Eye look and also kind of wing this out.
On oh my god why is this right doing.
This let's grab the one eyeshadow brush.
In the entire brush kit and try to blend.
This out the sad thing is i'm like.
Actually really trying here like i don't.
Want to lawsuit from crayola but i know.
You can feel it coming okay that's not.
That horrible what if i grab like a.
Regular morphe brush okay that's not.
Horrible it's like bad but like not the.
Worst me look at everything i'm like i.
Wonder if i grab a blending brush and.
Like a little bit of this oh okay that.
Actually works.
Okay what's actually really annoying is.
That blending the red and the yellow.
Together like didn't make orange i.
Wonder if i put this mango shade in here.
What that will do nothing it's gonna do.
Absolutely nothing apparently why can i.
Make orange like red plus yellow oh look.
At me being an artiste oh we we welcome.
To petit.
Maybe these are supposed to be like use.
When you're like not wearing makeup.
That's like that like it just over like.
A eye thing or like you'd like just put.
It on the cheek like as like a light on.
The go type of thing this is just not.
Good i think is the conclusion that i'm.
Coming to here okay i want to figure how.
To somehow finish this eye look and i.
Want to do a half cut crease so i can.
Turn out some of the shimmer shades in.
Here because they are so you look really.
Really stunning and i love the.
Highlighter in the face palette that we.
Used beforehand so i'm gonna grab my.
Shave tape concealer i'm gonna cut out.
The crease but i'm actually really.
Nervous to do this being that these.
Shadows are.
And are not drying down in the slightest.
Bit so this might all get mixed together.
And we're gonna find out in a few short.
Seconds i'm gonna grab my morphe i'm 2.
To 4 brush and start off with this kind.
Of light gold shade or right here at the.
Bottom and i'm gonna pack that on the.
Lid.
Hello what the heck what like this.
Swatch so nicely where is this on the.
Arm hello i do not see that do you i.
Feel like i need to treat you all the.
Way children right now because we're.
Doing a crayola makeup tutorial what is.
Going on now that the crease is all kind.
Of cut i'm gonna grab this like a.
Metallic kind of ready orange shade.
Right here on a fluffy brush and i want.
To use this to blend out the outer edge.
Into that red shadow that we have going.
On i'm just gonna pop this right here oh.
That's a good shadow okay not mad about.
It i don't want to deep it up that outer.
V a little bit too and add some more.
Dimension so i'm just gonna grab a smith.
235 brush and dip it this kind of like.
Muted grey tone up in this corner i'm.
Not sure how this is gonna turn out.
Let's just try this it's only one of the.
Worst a looks i've ever done and i'm.
Literally not even being ironic yes i am.
But i definitely use as much of the.
Colors as possible so we did get a black.
Crayon and i want to try to do a winged.
Liner with this which i know i'm going.
To regret but you know what you don't.
Know unless you try why is this black so.
Sheer why would you ever want a block.
That looks like this oh my god this is.
Also a cream so it's literally not gonna.
Dry down either that looks the worst.
Alright so that is the upper lash line.
All complete and it looks not good but.
Let's move on to the lower lash line i.
Think i want to add a pop of color.
Because i really am dying to try out.
This mermaid palette i first wanted one.
Of the crayon in the shade navy blue.
First of all this is like a sur lien.
That kinda that we all loved not dark.
Blue i want to pop this right up here.
For a fun pop of color and see how this.
Works.
See that's actually really pretty like.
That i can get behind.
We love great and then i'm gonna go a.
Mix of these two shades right up and.
Here with my morphe m14 9 brush and use.
That to epochal right over top to.
Actually set in the shade because cream.
Eyeshadow is whether or not crayola.
Knows they are.
Supposed to be set with something with.
That same brush i want to dip into this.
Darker purple shade it right up in here.
And give dada spreads a fix+ as well and.
Pack that on the outer corner because.
Purples are so pretty and i feel like.
It's very very rare that you see like a.
Metallic purple and an eyeshadow palette.
So i really want to test this out okay.
You know what as much as i was making.
Fun of it there i mean i showed up how a.
Hundred percent outperform the nude.
Palette this actually is really pretty.
I just can't get over the fact that this.
Black eyeliner is literally like not.
Block who does that.
How would you ever do that okay so i got.
This nude shade desert sand to pop in.
The lash line so we're gonna pop it in.
The lash line i feel like that did like.
Very i guess it kind of worked okay.
Should i tree white instead oh okay.
That's actually a bomb white liner kind.
Of all right that is enough of the.
Eyeshadows i thought mascaras these were.
16 dollars each i'm gonna start off with.
The black one on the upper lashes and.
See how this mascara actually it.
Performs.
I like this wand a lot actually wow as.
They filming this video literally could.
Not get any worse i am out of lash glue.
A gray bar 20 minutes later alright.
Finally huh.
That is one i look all complete looking.
In the mirror i actually don't hate how.
This turned out i feel like we had a.
Mission to go on and although we may.
Have failed i like the direction that.
This is going in and i really want to.
Recreate this look sometime soon with.
Like really good at working a product.
That being said this eyelid literally.
Took me 45 minutes to do and i still.
Don't feel like it's up to par the.
Blending is not great these cream.
Shadows still are not dry down which is.
Very very strange and it's just not as.
Vibrant and pigmented as i was like them.
To be that being said i'm gonna go and.
Do the other eye off-camera really.
Quickly and hopefully try to do it a.
Little bit faster and i'll be right back.
To finish off the rest of this crayola.
All right hello i am back and those are.
Both eyes oh complete thank god i'm.
Gonna finish up my look today with a lip.
So let's go ahead and grab the custom.
Lip palette i think i want to do.
Probably just like a nude lip i did a.
Rainbow i look so i think i need to like.
Balance out a little bit something you.
Thought i want to mix in this shade.
Together right here with a pink to make.
A slightly lighter nude let's see how.
This actually works under go this mom.
Shape eye down here mix it on my arm i.
Guess and then a little bit of this.
White shade.
Well okay they don't leer really creamy.
That's for sure which is great i want to.
Add a slight bit of yellow as well and.
Make it a little bit more peachy tone.
Let's try this what the heck that is not.
What i wanted okay it kind of tastes.
Like like not good.
Ugly lip color ever for this look i'll.
Take a bright barbie baby pink like no.
That is not what i wanted i wanted like.
A dark nude how do i make that maybe.
Like shad brown i would love to tell you.
How i got to this color but i don't even.
Know myself all right guys i'm calling.
It quits for this video today this.
Review has been something else.
Crayola sweetie love you the most you.
Made a childhood pretty iconic but i.
Think we need to stick to our 96 crayons.
For ten dollars because all this is not.
Working out.
Overall this collection is not.
Absolutely the worst but i definitely.
Not recommend you guys to go and run and.
Find your money on it these face cramps.
I would have to say by far the worst.
Thing in this entire collection they are.
Way too waxy it they're not that.
Pigmented and they do not blend out very.
Well they don't dry down and they're way.
Way a way to overprice the next demo eye.
Pencils are a much better alternative.
The eye shadow palettes however we're.
Actually not that bad specifically the.
Face one i actually really really like.
This one this highlighter shade right.
Here looked absolutely stunning on the.
Cheeks and this metallic coral blush i.
Am literally in love with i want to.
Reach for this all the time this summer.
And the mermaid palette as such as i was.
Actually making fun of it in the.
Beginning was actually a pretty bomb as.
Well and i love how it looks on the.
Lower lash line.
The lip palette although i was having a.
Really hard time finding a decent shade.
At first i think i was actually able to.
Mix together a really beautiful nude and.
The formula feels really really really.
Nice but i would definitely recommend.
Buying a lipstick instead because i know.
Most you guys don't want to sit there i.
Was thinking wording and mixed together.
A lipstick i know i certainly don't the.
Mascaras were okay they definitely like.
Did their job of coating and lash and.
Giving them a little bit of a lift but.
They're definitely not something that i.
Would recommend or say that you needed.
In your life and the brush collection is.
An absolute now please never spend $40.
On four brushes ever i actually really.
Really do love the look that i came up.
With today but it just took me way too.
Much time way too much ever and way too.
Much packing and blandings we ought to.
Really get.
Good eyelet going on i'm actually really.
Disappointed because you guys so i say.
All the time.
I wrote a big oprah r and you guys might.
Grew up drawing painting and coloring.
And crayola actually did have a huge.
Huge part in my life and it got me.
Through a lot of really really tough.
Times as a kid but it really sucks to.
Say that i will not be recommending this.
Collection to you guys and it will.
Definitely not be a part of my future.
Makeup routine that being said i really.
Hope you guys enjoyed this video today.
