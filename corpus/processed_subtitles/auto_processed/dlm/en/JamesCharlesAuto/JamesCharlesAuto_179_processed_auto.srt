Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel for.
Today so do i have something super fun.
Plan that i'm actually so excited for.
But i'm still used to watch tv with my.
Mom all the time and the one thing that.
I loved watching every single year was.
Award season i don't know why but.
Something about a red carpet just always.
Intrigued me so much and one of my.
Biggest goals growing up was to walk a.
Red carpet and now because of my amazing.
Job i pinch myself every single day.
Because at this point i feel like every.
Other week i'm walking some red carpet.
And doing interviews which is so crazy.
To me most celebrities when getting.
Photographed walking red carpet and.
Doing interviews like to look absolutely.
Perfect i mean of course who doesn't but.
That usually includes a very expensive.
Gowns very very beautifully done hair.
And intense glam makeup for some of the.
Best artists in the entire world but.
That process can be extremely costly.
Today i want to try to get red carpet.
Ready full makeup full outfit full.
Accessories in under $100 i have my $100.
Bill right in front of me left it over.
To the stores and see if we can get red.
Carpet ready and under $100 all right.
Guys we're here at cvs is gonna be our.
First stop of today's video hashtag not.
Sponsored you guys know i don't really.
Use drugstore products that often i mean.
My regular foundation alone would.
Literally eat up half of our budget so.
We're gonna do our best to find as many.
Products as we possibly can here to.
Still look good on a budget.
The first was gonna be a foundation i.
Heard the new maybelline superstay.
Foundation is so bomb this one is $12 so.
Definitely a little bit pricy and.
Sealing i'm gonna grab the maybelline.
Fit me concealer in the lightest shade.
This one is 749 all right i know that.
Nicki also owns the maybelline fit me.
Loose it setting powder i'm gonna try to.
Save myself $2 and look for the cote air.
Some powder at a different store and all.
That one.
Six dollars however that is the powder.
The created logic mary oh and i've got.
Carpets you have to be photographed so.
Hopefully we're looking smooth sober.
Mascara is gonna pick up the covergirl.
So ah she won't care which i was.
Literally the face for hello that is me.
But it's $11.99 and that is way out of.
Budget at this point like give me a.
Discount or something i was in the.
Commercial to the prognoses $10.50 the.
Pomade is $7.50 and so is the brown.
Shell i do have a pretty bushy brows but.
Wow a sister a family cannot have brows.
On fleek on a budget we're going with.
This and said this is the nyx eyebrow.
Pencil this one is $5 didn't even see.
Her highlighting in contour palette is.
$24.99 that's literally a quarter of our.
Budget i don't get it together sister.
Let's go for mascara today i'm gonna.
Grab the maybelline a great lash mascara.
That's one $5.99 and i know the.
Maybelline is known for having really.
Great mascaras so we're gonna pop that.
One in hopefully it'll be a budget saver.
Because mascara can be crazy expensive.
It's six to horse for a single shadow.
From l'oreal i don't think so sweetie.
What in wild has liquid liners for only.
Three dollars so i'm gonna throw one of.
Those in there and then i also still.
Really badly need a highlighter okay so.
What we're gonna do instead is i read.
About the blush and highlighter do which.
Is $5.99 and also the contour and banana.
Powder drew which is also $5.99 so the.
Tools together equal the same price but.
I'm gonna put this one back sorry sister.
Elf i still love you.
That way we're killing four birds with.
Two stones.
Yeah okay so you just hotel at cvs and.
We have a bunch of products our total.
Came to 44 something and that means we.
Have 55 dollars and one cent left for.
The rest of this video not too bad but.
We did already spend almost half our.
Budget and that's just on makeup we.
Still have clothes and accessories and.
Shoes i don't know if we can do this guy.
That's not looking too great so far away.
Guys we're on our second stop of sister.
Or walgreens we only have a few items.
Left to complete our full autumn makeup.
Look today all these loose motions from.
Kesab are $6.99 which is honestly not.
Much better than the old ones and before.
But it is saving at two dollars and he's.
Kind of look relatively normal so we're.
Gonna pick out these four cities look at.
Hope and pray that they work see about i.
Said it was launched in let's take our.
Total is going to be $10.83 399 clothing.
Store or less that's all you need so at.
Our last let's say we're going to view.
Friday and we only need a powder and a.
Lipstick left and our total right now is.
At forty four dollars and eight cents.
From a name.
$9 for lipstick hello $8 $9 hello it's.
Lipstick $7 we're gonna have like 4.
Cents for clothes i built your coach.
That i got in the next level we're at.
Cvs oh we might actually have to go back.
For that privacy biessing has apparently.
Lip products cost a trillion dollars.
Ease so cream which are still $7 the.
Liner in the shade in now she'll which.
Is three dollars and fifty cents and the.
Soft matte lip cream in the shade of.
Stockholm which is six dollars and 49.
Cents totaling to another $10 who's.
Gonna leave or clothing budget at around.
30 bucks i'm really hungry so i think.
I'm gonna use a dollar 69 on my budget.
On a snack okay guys so since we're here.
Earlier and already bought a bunch of.
Stuff we have a nine dollar off cvs.
Coupon design but oil cbs member so that.
Means it's ten dollars and ninety three.
Cents of lipstick and lip liner that we.
Just bought is now going to come to one.
Dollar in seventh wheel of a bargaining.
Couponing sister extreme couponers is.
Quaking right now alright guys we just.
Got back we finished our entire face of.
Makeup except for one thing and that is.
The trends there's a powder i know the.
Cody arizona is one of the cheapest and.
Best powders on the market but it's.
Always a little bit a walmart which we.
Don't really have a lot of so what i'm.
Gonna do is that is five dollars and.
Ninety seven cents and sales tax is.
Eight percent so if we do five wait nine.
Eight times 1.08 we get six dollars and.
Forty-five cents and subtract that from.
The budget.
3 34 35 36 36 dollars and 56 cents and.
When you just get an entire outfit so.
The one option that i have left that.
They can actually be a really great.
Solution is santee alley if you don't.
Know what santee alley it is basically a.
Really long street here in downtown la.
Where you can get everything in the.
Entire world from fake makeup to liberty.
Knock-off designer handbags jorian.
Outfits for a super super low price it.
Is our ticketing really late so nice.
Everything is closed down i think we're.
Going to call it a night but tomorrow.
Morning we will wake up early it gonna.
Early start and go clothes shopping and.
Find holy an entire outfit from head to.
Toe only $36.50 see you guys tomorrow.
Good morning sisters below it is the.
Next day i'm up ready and looking.
Fabulous kind of tonight it's our red.
Carpet event and i am so beyond excited.
We have thirty six dollars and fifty six.
Cents left and today we have to get a.
Full-on look i'm talking shoes shirt.
Pants accessories the full shebang in.
Order to get ready for this event and we.
Only have a few hours to do so hopefully.
We'll be able to complete this look on a.
Budget.
Music.
We've shared a bunch of store stuff on.
But we're coming to the same issue in.
That everything is actually really cute.
Here but a lot of the stuff is like.
Literally taking of the entire budget if.
We found a pair of shoes that were super.
Cute but there are 25 dollars we've got.
A paragraph they're really cute but.
There were 31 dollars we can't get those.
The album only five dollars this is.
Coming to be quite the dilemma up again.
I'm super lindsay of gucci so good but.
I'm not thinking that a jumpsuit might.
Be a really good option because it's.
Like two-in-one for one price so the.
Search has moved to a jumpsuit that'll.
Be our game plan.
Music.
Okay so we ended up getting that.
Jumpsuit it was retailing for $34.99 but.
We ended up being able to talk them down.
To actually $20 even thank god but that.
Is still a huge chunk of our ad budget.
That means we have sixteen dollars and.
Fifty six cents exactly left to finish.
Off this entire outfit we don't have.
Shoes we don't have accessories and.
There's a slave home too.
There's a million shoe shops here in.
Santee alley but almost every single one.
Of them is just heel like i've seen an.
87 billion pairs let's play but i've.
Seen like three pairs of boys shoes.
Which is like fine i guess i mean high.
Definitely a lot of a good a pair of.
Heels oh my god guys look we just found.
These knockoff uses for homie $15 lilly.
They're not even close to real as you.
Can see i have mine on right up in here.
But they are black and red which they.
Match perfectly in my jumpsuit and i.
Would so much other have a sneaker then.
A heel on because lord knows i can't.
Walk in here to save my life and i'd.
Probably fall over so these might be the.
Guy okay guys so my shoes earned nine.
And a half ten but we only have a size.
Eight so i'm gonna see if my sister.
Could do a squeeze we i actually fit.
Them they fit i need these right now.
Okay guys we have our jumpsuit and our.
Shoes now and the only thing that's left.
Is accessories but our only problem is.
We have a remaining balance of 56 cent.
So we might have to go a few dollars.
Over budget to get this perfect red.
Carpet look but i'm willing to do so.
It's a lot we're gonna break the bank by.
Just 56 cents it could really make or.
Break a look so let's see what we can.
Find.
Not only we have budgets ahem okay guys.
We just found this bracelet and three.
Ring trio for only 99 cents that does.
Actually put us over budget by a few.
Cents but i think accessories can really.
Make or break a look.
We are an you sent over budget but we.
Did it we are super close to $100 and.
Now that we're over budget oh well i.
Think i have one last thing that i want.
To buy before we go to today's law all.
Right sisters this should be a super.
Easy and quick joke so makeup tutorial.
Today we certainly do not have many.
Items to work with so starting off we do.
Not pry in the skin that because that.
Was out of budget so i'm gonna go to the.
Maybelline a brand new super state.
Foundation i got the shake lassic i.
Erase all i am praying this matches oh.
Okay honestly not a bad match at all i'm.
Just going to blend this all over the.
Skin like normal oh this foundation.
Looks amazing oh my god how much what.
It's only $11 i'm chuck the one really.
Annoying thing about drugs are makeup.
Shopping no matter how good a product is.
Is that you can't actually test it out.
In store so as you can see it this.
Foundation definitely oxidized a little.
Bit and is a little bit darker than my.
Skin tone so i'm gonna go to my next.
Step being the maybelline fit me.
Concealer and i got the lightest shade.
So hopefully this will help kind of.
Brighten everything up and kind of make.
It match a little bit better i'm gonna.
Put this right in the center of my.
Forehead and then right under my eyes.
And a triangle shape and you guys know.
Used to be my concealer all the way out.
Up into here for that really snatched.
Look but more recently i've been kind of.
Focusing on my highlights only on the.
Very center of my face it's a very kim.
Case i love holiday and contouring but i.
Really really love how it makes my skin.
Look and how it brings attention right.
Here to the center of my face it's got a.
Cover of the mustache you guys not even.
Gonna lie i am absolutely in love with.
How my skin looks right now i am so.
Shocked to the core it looks so.
Beautiful oh my god.
I'm gonna go mike oh dear some powder.
And just set underneath the eyes today.
You guys know i usually love to kind of.
Make a face and plays but i also love to.
Go in with a setting sprays and like a.
Mac fix+.
In between at my powder steps to really.
Melt everything in and $20 for mac fix+.
Was definitely not in the budget i mean.
Literally fix+ bodysuit fix+ bodysuit.
The last night i went to the gym was.
Never so i'd rather not go naked.
Oh you're literally kidding me so i'm.
Gonna temp to bronze and copper in phase.
Using what's left of this way while do.
Oh crap oh that is very pigmented maybe.
Because it's broken into a million.
Pieces can't forget to chisel out the.
Hairline of course let's be real though.
The true test of a contour sauce.
Broadway promoter is can it snatch a.
Sister knows i'm not not at the nose.
Contour but i'm also not like happy with.
Her she's like okay i'm gonna grab a.
Flat powder brush and dip into the.
Highlighting excuse me.
Banana powder side of this duo and i'm.
Gonna pop this in the center of my.
Forehead to bring back some of the.
Lights and i'm also gonna place this.
Right underneath my eyes and right up to.
The sides of my nose to really brighten.
Everything up and further the illusion.
Of a pinched and snatched rhinoplasty.
Next to finish off my skin and base i'm.
Gonna open up this blush and highlight.
Our duo from al i think this one was.
Literally only a $5 which is a snow bomb.
And i'm just gonna play a both of these.
To my cheekbones starting off with a.
Highlighter hello.
I'm gonna try digging my brush into this.
And actually breaking it a little bit to.
See if that way the pigment will.
Actually you know show up oh there she.
Is.
Okay i actually love how this looks i'm.
Gonna go with a little bit of blush on.
An angled brush just to kind of blend.
The contour and highlight together or.
Not.
Don't love doing this for some reason.
You literally have to scrape the top.
Layer off of this i think it's because.
It's a baked formula but the actual.
Pigmentation of the product underneath.
Is really really bomb and i'm loving how.
My skin looks right now before i do my.
Brows my eyes as usual i'm just gonna.
Grab my damp beauty blender and.
Literally the lightest bit of powder and.
Just bake along the sides of my nose to.
Really snatch it in a place and then.
Just right underneath that contour as.
Well moving right along this is going to.
Be our brows and for this one we're.
Using the nyx eyebrow pencil that's.
Almost four dollars it was the only the.
Only one that was within budget let's.
See how this one compares to our normal.
I think.
21 or 22 dollar benefit personally my.
Brow pencil oh this is big i mean let's.
Be real we do usually love a good sister.
A big tip but right now this might not.
Be very helpful let's see what we can do.
Here this brow pencil supposed to be.
Dark brown but it started coming off as.
Like red on my skin this is not what we.
Need right now not the worst.
I know but definitely not the best i'm.
Gonna grab my maybelline fit me.
Concealer on the back of my hand and.
Just a flat top concealer brush and.
Attempt to clean them up a little bit.
Although i'm really not sure how much.
That is gonna help being that the main.
Issue here is definitely the color of.
The brow but i'm not gonna complain.
Because clearly we have not a single.
Penny left to go exchanges or trying to.
Get a new one so gotta make do with what.
You got honestly it really doesn't look.
Top out i'm definitely being dramatic.
And the rest my face looks amazing so.
Far so i don't want to get discouraged.
By it just the brows no next of course.
Comes the eyes and if you're an avid and.
Creative makeup lover like i am you.
Would know that i shadow can sometimes.
Get really really expensive or really.
Fast for some reason though i was not.
Able to find a single big eye shadow.
Palette anywhere at any of the drugstore.
As he went to i either found these ones.
Like white and wild is what i'm gonna be.
Using today or tiny little single.
Shadows from like l'oreal that were like.
$12 each hello.
I absolutely did not think so so i.
Picked this but i'm gonna do my best to.
Create a soft claim look from it today.
I'm first gonna go over tiny powder.
Blush in the shade this has a brow bone.
And pop.
Right on the top my brow bone to give it.
A nice little highlight and left before.
I apply some shadow oh that's actually.
Kind of pretty i'll also go to place a.
Little bit of that right on the inner.
Corner to really make that area of my.
Face pop and bring attention to the eyes.
I'm then gonna grab my fluffy brush this.
Is the morphe i'm a four-for-one use.
Cochise for 10% off for all your future.
Budget discount shopping and dip into.
The shade up transition right up here at.
The top tap off the excess and i'm gonna.
Pop that right in the crease as my.
Transition shade.
Well that pigmentation is definitely.
Rather unfortunate i guess and they say.
Transition they really mean transition.
Because that color is literally barely.
Even there i am like dying to put a.
Darker brown in the crease really define.
It but the crease shade in this palette.
Is html shade which is a major major.
Makeup no no you do not put shimmers in.
The crease literally ever there are.
Barely any rules to make up with that is.
One of them for sure so i'm gonna do is.
Crack back open my very very shattered.
Wet-and-wild bronzer and dip into that.
With a fluffy crease brush and use that.
To define out the crease a little bit.
More okay now we're getting somewhere.
Popping back into the little eyeshadow.
Pot i'm gonna grab this pinkish shade.
Called.
Eyelid right on a dense packing brush.
And pack that right on but i would oh.
That's actually kind of pretty with that.
Okay down i can work with that this.
Eyeshadow honestly is not looking back.
At all i'm kind of taking it i'm gonna.
Finish off by adding a little bit of a.
Wing using the wet n wild mega liner.
This was only three dollars you know.
Those days where our letter just keeps.
Getting thicker and thicker and thicker.
Because you keep messing up and putting.
On concealer and then adding more liner.
Then messing up then putting on more.
Liner than adding more concealer today.
Is one of those days i really wanted to.
Find my lower lash in just a little bit.
More but clearly we don't have any tarte.
Brown eyeshadow so what i'm actually.
Gonna do is grab my brow pencil from.
Before and really lightly and carefully.
Run this right up against my lower lash.
Line to create a little bit.
Dimension oh oh that kind of actually.
Looks good hello hack this outlook isn't.
Even that bad but i think that lash is.
Directly gonna take it to the next level.
So i'm gonna give my lashes a good and.
Fresh curl and then apply a layer of the.
Maybelline a great laughs that i found.
At cvs this one was only seven dollars i.
Usually love maybelline mascaras but.
Honestly not gonna lie i am definitely.
Not impressed with this one i feel like.
With mascara it is definitely one of.
Those products that when you pay more.
You usually do get more bang for your.
Buck but all-time favorites are the.
Benefit roller lash and mac extended.
Play and this one will definitely not be.
Replacing either of those anytime soon.
So to add a little bit more oomph on my.
Eyes i'm gonna pop on these lashes from.
Kiss that i found at walgreens these are.
In the style horse it and i got them.
Because they kind of loosely sorry lily.
Arrived me of miami looking at these.
Lashes if i could describe i would.
Simply say that they are underwhelming.
The actual style of the lash is.
Literally so pretty and for only i think.
They were six dollars and fifty cents.
They're really really nice lashes.
They're 3d they're separated they're.
Nice and fluffy the band is comfortable.
But i would say that the hairs.
Themselves on the actual lashes are too.
Short and they don't make a big enough.
Impact so those are the eyes all.
Complete and that was definitely a.
Little bit of a struggle but i feel like.
We came through i'm honestly a pretty.
Happy with these results.
It looks pretty beautiful so i'm gonna.
Go ahead and wipe away the bake and it's.
Been on there for quite a long time now.
I'm gonna go ahead and line my lips.
Quickly he's in the nyx liner and the.
Shade natural i really like this color.
It was one religion by a few days ago.
She uses one and she said this is her.
All-time favorite so i had to pick it up.
For today's look and it was only three.
Dollars and then last but certainly not.
Least i'm gonna fill in my lips using.
The nyx soft matte lip cream in the.
Shade of stockholm all right sisters i.
Guess this look is complete normal you.
Know i would give myself a good spritz.
Of a setting spray but that was out of.
Budget for today so i'm gonna go ahead.
And change into my red carpet-ready.
Outfit and i'll be right back to show.
You guys the finished completed.
Oh you guys this is the finished.
Completed look particularly i have.
Something else hold on did i send an.
Extra twenty one dollars of the budget.
That we didn't have to create a red.
Cover for myself.
Absolutely alright you guys so this is.
The braddock carpet both look complete.
Clearly i do not have a red carpet to.
Attend tonight but you know what it's.
The thought that counts we have a full.
Look from head all the way down to the.
Toes and i'm honestly kind of living for.
It not gonna lie it if we look in the.
Mirror overall this challenge was.
Honestly really really challenging but.
Also really really incredibly fun to do.
Although i definitely love to treat.
