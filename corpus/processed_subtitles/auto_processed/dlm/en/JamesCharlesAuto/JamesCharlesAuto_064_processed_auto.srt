Use liquid latex and a lot of toilet.
Paper to do this okay was gonna be.
Putting on lots of layers of it grayson.
What's your favorite halloween memory i.
Think when i was little my mom used to.
Get really creative she's an artist of.
Russia she does hair day you know i mean.
She's a really crafty she was also like.
Really painting enjoying myself like.
That we would always make like all our.
Halloween time like homemade halloween.
Costumes like we would never buy all the.
Custom from the store just wasn't like.
The thing we did her family i remember.
Going into a halloween store when i was.
Little and i was like wait they sell.
Costumes here like i was like everyone.
Was supposed to make them i would always.
Help my mom like bake my costume ethan.
Wouldn't he would just sit there kind of.
Do the same thing.
Funny i remember that stachy treats in.
My pillowcase because i also didn't ever.
Have yeah you can run what the real ones.
Are a pillowcase and because your.
Parents are cheap.
I remember asked my mom we can get a.
Little pumpkin head no she's a cute.
Pillowcase no no use water i don't want.
To spit well that's right it's gonna set.
In place once again using somewhat.
Translucent powder to lock all the late.
Nights in place just like you said we're.
Gonna do a quick coat of light.
Foundation on at the normal skin side.
And it's gonna use a more fiji one rose.
Just stipple it on now we're gonna take.
This and just peel it off i'm gonna peel.
Up the one side that the mummy is going.
To be layered underneath the mummies.
Within me oh kind of fun oh okay i feel.
Really melvindale okay now i'm gonna.
Grab a pair of scissors that i'm going.
To go and just i'm just going to trim.
Off any excess that's like really doing.
That kind of fish mm-hmm should you be.
Careful no and i'm not gonna go really.
Fast but i am i'm gonna kind of do this.
Carelessly not to cut crazy no but what.
I care what sleaze the word i think i'm.
Gonna okay just just say no gonna go.
Carefully because i want the edges to be.
Messy so it like looks real.
Well don't cut your friends this is.
Better halloween psi from me and grayson.
To you.
We should probably paint your eye and.
Mouth black before we put on the texture.
Yeah yes so i'm gonna do that.
Music.
Suncoast once did you thanks for asking.
Yeah i woke up little boy little cowboy.
At the bottom of my bed really literally.
Just staring at me.
It was in fact bright out but my shades.
Were just closed and he was just looking.
At me i didn't pay attention to his face.
But i saw his whole outfit.
He had the boots of the spurs he had did.
And he had a bottom i'm skinny he had.
Like just like suspenders and like was.
Wearing a cowboy hat a little a little.
Badge i sat up rub my eyes open them.
Again it was still there and we're just.
Going through was just rocking back and.
Forth forgive me like this oh god.
Oh was it young either i was like i was.
Like ten.
And i was like ethan i knew it wasn't.
Heated bunnykins room was across the.
Hall from me so i screamed like you know.
My door was open a little bit of cracked.
Ice cream ethan the thing is still there.
I'm moving around like rubbing my eyes.
Like what he viewed part of my face it's.
Still just there and ice cream eating.
The ice cream eat that ice cream ethan.
He doesn't wake up coz he never wakes up.
And then i think my mom said like what.
My mom's dancers already like what are.
We getting ready for the day i look at.
My door to like talk to her through the.
Coz she's down the hall which i just.
Hang with my voice down like out the.
Door and i looked back and it was gone.
That's so crazy.
I believe in ghosts but i don't believe.
Like oh like someone tells me they saw a.
Ghost when did you really write you.
Don't even have always been like that.
But it wasn't scared i wasn't scared to.
Go to sleep at night and like usually it.
Would be like i'm a    like when i.
Watch scary movies.
Uh i'm too afraid to sleep alone like.
The sinister the ghoul ugly hate him.
He's so scared dude don't be predictive.
Of all i always imagined him just.
Staring at me when i was like.
Asleep were you actually said uh yeah.
Very during the movie i was watching it.
And even probably i think it was with.
The girl yeah and i had my eyes closed.
The whole time didn't care.
Didn't try to be a tough guy except for.
The fact that i was very scared of the.
Movie and i kept my eyes closed i don't.
Really get scared by things that easily.
I don't know why everyone thinks not.
Like free usually yeah well i do look.
Kind of look at mommy if you look.
Head-on okay what's up guys i just rose.
From my tomb and hey just going to set.
That liquid latex in place now i'm gonna.
Take a pair of tweezers and i'm gonna.
Start picking out grace and skin pick it.
The texture looks good huh it's.
Disgusting it looks like it got dug up.
From a tube you know but there we go and.
Of good i'm gonna grab now i guess i.
Foundation call her but like mixed it.
With like white and like green but the.
Level is really great like yellow what's.
That for dad oh here we go no that's.
Like on there's a face i want to go over.
With white and gray to like make it not.
Look like that now i'm gonna use lots of.
Black and spooking it up a little bit.
I'm gonna paint black underneath the.
Lifted the skin areas as well to show.
Through the fact that there's like.
Lifting and dimension even if you kinda.
Look like a spook money yeah i do kind.
Of good kind of fresh kind of spooky.
Kinda fun.
So once again i got out a little bit of.
A black shadow just to set some of that.
Black paint in place did he do the.
Shadow from oh she's really pigmented.

Endearing to see james actually like.
Exhausted by something because like i've.

He gets tired but i feel like he's.
Always just going and then like feeling.

10 7 on top don't ask me to review.
Things i can't decide like it's good.
Like i don't know.
I just want to give a warning to you.
What you're doing your halloween makeup.
This year do not attempt more than three.
Looks because i say don't do more than.
One we had to make a disclaimer come on.
G so i've hurt my back and forth between.
Many different ideas that is had what.
Look i wanted to do i ultimately decided.
That i have no ideas so i'm going to be.
Recreating the look that i did on the.
Twins last year what was a werewolf.
Makeup and i did this in literally 30.
Minutes east so it was very very rushed.
And very fast but ended up looking at a.
Really really dope actually and so many.
Of you guys requested a tutorial that.
Was my first time actually ever meeting.
The twins.
I am very annoying to them right now.
Because this day has been a nightmare.
But i am so blessed to have them in my.
Life seriously it's been an amazing year.
And i cannot wait for many more together.
I feel like it's just gonna be like a.
Combination of lots of different like.
Strokes.
Grab some black really put that in there.
Start some fur what iv hot with a beard.
T basically i think i put block like all.
The way around the face okay and the.
Brow makeup nice and bushy good.
Reminiscence of james charles at 2016.
Blaack eyebrows we love her gonna throw.
Some brown in the mix let's see what she.
Has to bring to the table i'm gonna buy.
Some white mix with greg and like right.
Here a little bit on the cheekbone for a.
Little werewolf glow okay i think i need.
To make the eyeball like blah that's.
What i did last year that i just took.
This no gonna feather this black liner.
Out as if it's like a little furs things.
Gonna take some little white furs step.
Perhaps some brow that's looking okay.
I'm going to pop some white in this.
Little inner corner that i just created.
To open up the werewolf eye i'm gonna.
Draw the nose now exercise i have not.
Talked in the buddy 20 minutes sorry.
About that so that's pretty much the.
Face makeup all complete am i happy with.
This debatable and i'm gonna keep moving.
00 in the.
Morning.
So what i'm going to do now is add the.
Gash on my neck that i gave the twins.
Last year which i actually think and.
Really pull the entire look together so.
Who knows maybe this will be a whole lot.
Better what i'm gonna do is more liquid.
Latex or to end this entire area and.
Then it got me uneven shards of toilet.
Paper we're just going to stick it on.
There or liquid latex more paper and now.
I'm gonna let this dry okay i'm just.
Gonna layer over top of this with.
Somewhat foundation to blend it into my.
Natural skin tone the worst thing i've.
Ever done it's gonna cut three good and.
Fresh gashes using the block from the.
Makeup firmer but i'm just going to fill.
In those three gashes just looks like.
They were deep cuts with my thick blood.
I'm going to grab a little palette and.
I'm going to shove this in there hey don.
I'm still alive but i'm barely breathing.
Literally.
Music.
00 in the morning yeah i'm the.
Itchy as i've ever been all year.
Probably my looks so good.
I think the liquid uh looking at latex.
Really like held up i was the last one.
To get my makeup done before james and.
Mine is still the most ruined oh what.
Did you do what did you do i don't know.
I'm crazy with those contacts i'm sorry.
But i i don't know what i did i just.
Like i look around and i doing a little.
Circle of like foundation i'm like.
