Haven't even played with it yet so look.

Or even thousands of tweets and messages.
Play with the james palette la has been.
Burning to the ground in case anyone.
Didn't know there was crazy fires so the.
Fires are over we're about it's home.
Thank god it's been a really crazy month.
So that was all going on not only did i.

Was our first video we ever done for.
Today's video we're gonna do something.

To see if both of our palettes are.
Jeffrey's are approved and james charles.
Of yes we're gonna do a little sister i.
Can't wait you're oh oh wha.
No your palette has so many colors i.
Don't know what i'm gonna do today but.
We're gonna head we're gonna figure it.
Out on the spot i can't wait i'm very.
Inspired by looking at all this already.
Exactly what i'm gonna do with that oh.
My god okay putting it together in my.
Head yeah we obviously have no makeup on.
Today so we're gonna do a little.
Checkerboard with us and we'll see our.
Re are each other's palettes are each.
Other's palettes approved oh okay.
Probably.
Music.
So i haven't seen you in a minute a lots.
Happened you've moved we both launched.
Palace.
Everything's things are crazy you didn't.
Used to meet and greets like the world.
Is just they can't handle it it's sister.
Now it's sister doubt it hasn't crazy.
Like i have been obviously i mean you.
Know we've been talking about like this.
Launch for a very very long yes we're.
Like a super helpful advocate and friend.
To me during the whole process so you've.
Kind of been involved with that that's a.
Beginning it's hard to like know a.
Secret and like keep it in yeah just be.
So excited because yeah i've known about.
This obviously for a while you guys and.
It's just been so cool to watch james.
Like think of it create it execute it do.
The shoots the ad campaigns everything.
It's been just so fun i've been sitting.
On this for so long now so it feels so.
Good until i finally put out well it's.
Been interesting it's been a wild ride.
Right okay watching some of these.
Reviews and stuff of people just talking.
About it like both positive and negative.
It's like a really really overwhelming.
Oh yeah i want to ask you about that oh.
So someone that started right away right.
That has created makeup it's so curious.
To someone when they finally put.
Something out you're like what has been.
The biggest struggles i guess besides.
Seeing reviews i don't to say the.
Biggest things went ruggles because for.
The most part all the reviews have been.
So positive.
And they've it they really have.
Literally like the whole point of the.
Campaign was to only shoot an artist as.
I said 800,000 times last month but like.
I love that looks that i've been seeing.
People create are like blowing my mind.
Yeah oh my god even on the way here that.
Crazy yeah oh my god after this game ago.
Painting yes i've seen so many artists.
That i've like loved and looked up to.
Test out the palette and just do the.
Coolest things with it and like i.
Literally sure to cry like looking.
Through.
Just cause like i mean like that's.
Exactly what i want it like i feel are.
Inspired and they're really going into.
That's what i'm fairly gonna see in.
Their view if you would really look at.
The palette and i'm inspired and i'm.
Like yes that is what i wanted overall.
The sentiment has been nothing but like.
Amazing what's been hard is like.
Obviously i worked on this for a very.
Very long time and i'm super confident.
Out of like the product that we put out.
But of course there's always many people.
Who don't like it and who want to.
Criticize which is fine because.
Everybody has a right to their opinion.
But yeah it's really really frustrating.
When i feel as though at least i've been.
Pretty transparent with like the.
Ingredients and what kind of can't be.
Used in different techniques that i.
Think work best that a horse has just.
Been like people love to make up like.
Stories and it's kind of hard because we.
Need when you own a brand or when you.
Pet a product you don't want it to seem.
Like you can't take criticism criticism.
Is great i love that that's how i've.
Learned it improved along the way but i.
Have seen some people making a blatant.
Lies i don't know if you want to address.
That i mean i'm open about it like just.
As a consumer i just think have kind of.
Upset seeing people not be honest i.
Guess or like just saying something for.
Attention well i think like the whole.
Press penguins thing has been really.
Quite a learning experience for both me.
And the morphe team as well like okay i.
Obviously don't do makeup production.
Ever i don't have a company and my.
Channel is not reviews it's not testing.
All new products ever it's literally.
Just like i'm gonna throw this look i.
Hope yes nicer news once in a while in a.
Blue moon right yeah exactly so for me.
When i was working with the team and.
Wanted to create a really super matte.
And pigmented rainbow palette i learned.
That a lot of the shades could not be.
Firm elated as typical actually doesn't.
Know how to be considered press penguins.
And yes dad because that's like the way.
That you get those formulas to work and.
Our sleep blend out which definitely do.
Take a little bit of more extra love and.
Care what you have to.
Percent products but when i was filling.
My attend million special video a few.
Days ago i made a reference to the knock.
That's like the palette is made for.
Artists if you were trying to create a.
Watercolor painting you would never put.
Water clubs on campus or you've never.
Put kerlick paint or oil paint on.
Whatever because it would through if.
Something is formulated a certain way.
And somebody's telling you hey this.
Works best this way it really blows my.
Mind that people like don't want to hear.
That and instead they're yeah oh my god.
Like yours quaint with excuses like the.
Product just socks it's like no every.
Product has an instruction whether it's.
This bottle or this sponge there's less.
Instructions over someone's giving you.
Advice you know you should take it right.
It's not mandatory like you can still.
Put watercolor on campus you can so put.
Oil paint on watercolor paper it's just.
Not gonna look as good as it could if.
You follow the recommended instructions.
You know so just dealing with that has.
Been really eye-opening for me because.
Of course like i want to be as educated.
As it possibly can when it comes to my.
Followers purchasing a palette because.
My name is on it but at the same time.
Like i'm not a scientist already.
Learning and educating myself the entire.
Time there was obviously a few people.
That made videos about it i'm like why.
On different tangents stuff like.
Different staining which oh my god mark.
Can we talk about that i guess do you.
Want to yeah i don't think it's a bad.
Thing and i think it's cool that i'm.
Actually here because the blood sugar.
Palette that i created yum earlier this.
Year has been a huge hit it's sold.
Astronomical but half the palette or.
Pressed pigment yeah psyche lee talked.
About this in the video i did not so i.
Okay a lot of tweets be like oh my god.
James doesn't care about his consumers.
Jeffery always cares he always lists.
Everything and i'm like you guys did.
Everything i did i'm also like jeffrey's.
Been doing this on his channel for a.
Year he does this every single video.
I've never done this before so it's like.
So people were upset that you didn't.
Fully go into detail by or why so i got.
I'm in full disclosure half the.
Polonaise pressed pigments i was very.
Clear about that and very open and.
Honest about that you'd have to use.
Certain techniques and products if you.
Want it to perform the best and because.
Of the fact that there.
Past payments by fda standards a lot of.
Them technically are not i say yes but.
That being said i abuse every sing one.
Of them on my eye and i've never had an.
Issue almost all my friends are almost.
All my friends are but some people do.
Have sensitive skin and sages eyelids.
Yeah and it will stain some people i've.
Got insane by every single think i've.
Ever used things like that i don't care.
What brand it is.
Every single thing i said i wouldn't.
Stay insane but i've never been.
Effective but the reality is some people.
Do have sensitive skin and can have.
Allergic reactions but yes it's up to.
The consumer to of course read the.
Directions if you're allergic to.
Something.
Check the box before putting it on yeah.
Because everybody has different.
Allergies and different skin they do it.
Can be tricky but i think you just got.
To read the box right i think that i.
Don't like here's what i think from.
Someone that is an onlooker and as a.
Friend i don't like when people try to.
Make it seem like you are out to do.
Something that you're not like you are.
Out to stay in everyone's limbs and not.
Tell anyone i'm like oh my god it's just.
A ridiculous like and i don't want to.
Say that it's common sense because not.
Everyone is gonna be aware that's my.
Mistake because i obviously wouldn't.
Make up for a very very long time and i.
Said many times that i formulate this.
Palette for my fellow artists for people.
To travel with for people to take with.
Them and be able to create literally.
Right but at the same time i was.
Watching a few videos and a lot of.
People pointed out i do have a very very.
Diverse audience a few demos of makeup.
But also have literally never put it on.
And just watch my videos we want to.
Support you and try yes so i may not i.
Will admit that it i shouldn't have said.
That it was common sense because i guess.
It's really not but in my hat because i.
Do this every single day and i've always.
Been standard just like of course my.
Eyeshadows could stain sometimes but i.
Know i understand but not everyone knows.
That right but i also think if you have.
Bought something from my brand or morphe.
Before and it's change your live like.
You're you know bright shadows are gonna.
Stay in yeah but it's also a learning.
Experience i think that people lying and.
Trying to get attention from it is.
Annoying but that's part of the game.
Right right but it i guess it sucks when.
You put so much love and care into.
Something and someone wants to flip it.
And like it's bad and you're like girl.
What are you talking about so yeah you.
Know you you get your feelings hurt.
You know you get upset because you want.
To defend it because you.
You know it's like come on if you're.
Proud of your work that's your baby.
Exactly just gonna dip into a little.
Sister setting dinner how has been.
Driving really good i'm not very good at.
That.
Okay but no crashes yeah good actually.
Crashing me either.
You don't have noticed people here suck.
At driving oh my god nobody uses their.
Turn signals no one can tell you why.
Because i'm from here i can tell you why.
Means - because when you do use your.
Turn signal in la and you're in traffic.
No one will let you work well yeah i've.
Noticed that too so no one does anymore.
Because it's like oh when you turn your.
Signal on in other parts of the world.
Like michigan or in you know oh yes.
Please come into my lane yeah over here.
It's like oh like we're not letting you.
Win oh so i don't even bother with the.
Blinker you just gotta cut someone off.
Or you got to be really safe and keep it.
Moving people are crazy but i love that.
We have matching cars let's see why does.
Ever i mean i think tesla's are just so.
Sick though it's very youtube which is.
Kind of funny i mean it's literally like.
Driving an iphone yes sister star yeah.
How for you the james charles artistry.
Palette yes and here is the alien.
Palette bam both of which by now i'll.
Turn this videos up they'll be fully.
Tommy back in stock in two days now okay.
On december 6 yes your alarms let's pray.
I have stock left it's set your alarms.
Okay so this is my first time ever i'm.
Doing two full first impressions um a.
Lot of people are gonna say well you're.
Sitting next to james i already know.
Just from all my friends using it that.
This palette is great i also am not.
Concerned so exactly fine and also you.
Don't probably i mature enough.
Like we said criticism is everywhere yes.
Okay cool so i like to use a paint pot.
Oh my god yeah i need to see you okay.
That's funny wait what color.
Painterly paint really this is not okay.
What the hell i mean this is not planned.
I always have been formulated to talk.
For so long now when i came to promoting.
These colors like we talked about.
Number-one priority with pigmentation.
Yes am i getting those rainbow mattes to.
Be super super vibrant which is hard and.
If people don't know that in the lab and.
In yeah you know the chemists they.
Really have to work hard to make a.
Beautiful formula they do it's really.
Really challenging it was important to.
Yeah so i'm the type of person i will.
Say that i'm definitely difficult to.
Work with because i know what i want and.
I will never settle for loss which is.
Good love that hi i'm sophie tv-like do.
It they're like no we count like no i.
Want you to do it.
Yeah then we can't do that like yeah see.
Well you're gonna do it yeah i think.
It's cool cuz maybe you pushed their.
Boundaries and i did which is kind of.
Cool i did and like i'm really part of.
The finished product and i've heard like.
The morphe team is really proud of it as.
Well good they were and they really are.
And i think it's great because you.
Challenge them and they listen they.
Could have been like no we're good.
Sweetie but the fact that they like took.
Everything you said into consideration.
And you leave me buddy vision come to.
Life that's awesome just like the bass.
Yeah i love morphe so much say well kind.
Of look at you feeling i'm feeling a lot.
Of color do like a red orange yellow and.
Then what i agree boober well the other.
Are okay i mean yeah i'm you know i'm.
Down i love that i'm really down the.
Purple first i know i'm gonna grab the.
Shade of area 51 on my tablet four five.
Six brush this is from my brush that.
More her okay now let's talk about.
Purple shades they are so hard to make i.
Know it's funny the purple is the only.
Pressed pigment in the alien pellet.
Really yeah blood sugar had like 12 cuz.
You know breads are yes yes i don't know.
How much i can say but i will say that.
The purple shade gave me quite an issue.
In black kala and honestly through.
Formulating the purple is actually how i.
Figured out that using an eye primer.
Like paint power or like really how's.
What makes it work so much better.
I mean use a packet on which i'm saying.
The entire time hmm okay where do i.
Start.
Why am i feeling like blues and purples.
On one eye yeah should i go in at purple.
First two i'm gonna go the shady phone.
The home now on my m-43 oh my god was.
Purple lays down really good yeah were.
You nervous about this color yeah.
Horrified.
Oh my god.
Is this morphe 433 work i just i want.
Nothing but perfection like i'm such a.
Perfectionist i like i i refuse to do.
Anything that was like very scary going.
Into it i'm just gonna blend this out.
Right above that purple edge i'm just so.
Sad you have like a product out has.
Everyone asked you if you want to do.
Your own makeup brand when everybody's.
An aussie what snacks i'm like ready.
Hello three at least three seconds to.
Breathe i know right when you launch.
Something everyone will be like what's.
Next what's next really a girl let me.
Breathe for a second for me i definitely.
Don't think that i want my own brand.
Right now at least for right now but.
Honestly i don't even know about the.
Future i'm not that interested about.
Development to be honest with you it's.
Just got something like this palette for.
Me was like my main project that i'm.
Working on for so long and i'm super.
Passionate about and i've had an idea.
For forever okay but i don't really have.
That many other ideas up my sleeve that.
I'm like oh this needs to be somebody i.
Love that you're not just doing it to do.
It there's a lot of people have you in.
Your position we're just kind of like.
Okay well let's just wing it and let's.
Just go for and you're like no honey.
There are all ways that i obviously can.
Make a living and make money and i just.
Don't want to put my name on products.
Just about anyone products like i refuse.
To do that i don't need to have them.
Very blast of the following fan base.
That supports whatever i do yeah so i.
Love those wait and see for right now.
I'm really focused on sister's apparel.
And i do have some other things in the.
Works as well but 30 it's not a.
Cosmetics brand okay yay i love that.
You're actually here next to me so you.
Can tell me the shades oh it's a single.
Yes i love single.
Bring me mmm very not me but i love the.
Color hey minx brother is single and.
Mainly straight.
Alright after ali huh and he just moved.
Here work i am designing this outer.
Crease region i'm really sure what i'm.
Doing but it's looking a pretty so far.
What was your inspiration behind the.
Alien palette i've been called an alien.
Forever my nickname in high school was a.
Little alien was it really yeah cuz i.
Shaved my eyebrows in 10th grade so.
Matches yes so for the photo you did.
Yeah so the first imagine that the first.
Day i show up.
No brows everyone was like hello what.
The heck is going on around here so.
Alien just kind of stuck and i just love.
Extraterrestrial things i think there's.
Obviously i believe in aliens i'm right.
Here.
What they're not the balloon right but i.
Really wanted to perfect and have like.
No kinks in my palate like perfect the.
Greens just kind of you're like a whole.
Different story and i really want to do.
A different shape i think i'm done.
Rectangles for all my palettes thus far.
Right stick in a while that's very.
Something different you're the packaging.
Is seconding i love it thank you.
Artistry is so ready that's what he was.
On your leg literally yesterday yeah so.
Artistry is made to be like a topper.
Color so it performs best overtop of.
Like a black or a darker but we're like.
A blue like it's meant to really bring.
Out those other shades.
Okay there's two shades like that in the.
Poet actually artistry and this.
Literally some people were sparked and.
Being like oh my god they're not that.
Pigmented but that's the point.
Actually they're supposed to be used.
Okay which ones that one this one this.
One literally is bad it's literally.
Literally that's like peachy pink so you.
Can either use it for a highlighter if.
You use it lightly which i love it looks.
So stunning or what i like actually.
Using a lot of it and blending it really.
Blends your powder and blush together so.
I see okay that's why all that later i.
Really like this color that which all.
Home color oh baby is like a weird bobby.
Brown yeah i'm gonna take more area 51.
Right now i'm gonna put it on this other.
Ain't gonna hurt he wants to do black in.
The center with artistry over it.
Oh yeah i just dip into that once hi i.
Love a good black it's really pigmented.
I was the drama around the palette to.
The swatches oh my god i don't put on.
Eye shadow with my fingers unless it's.
Like a really crazy metallic so it's.
Like why does what swatches matter so.
Much.
I think we're getting away from that.
Hopefully but it's like girl oh my god.
Look at that black looks like a liner.
Already look at that let me keep it like.
That but some sure that's oh hi not.
Second hang okay i love that we love an.
Accident.
Look my birth oh sorry mom team okay i'm.
Gonna cut my crease okay i'm loving.

Pointing to the shades that were named.
After that oh you know i did um hello in.
Here yes.
What should i do over here with the.
Yellow either so good the bright gold oh.
Wait it's like singing it okay so like i.
Said earlier this launch has been.
Obviously exciting for me but it's also.
Something new that i i've never dealt.
With and there's definitely been.
Challenges with it and i've gotten upset.
And stuff and i'm trying my best to.
Really handle myself maturely and be.
Professional because that my name is.
Attached obviously we were talking cuz.
As soon as i announce that you obviously.
Wanted to film with it which was so cool.
And meant the world to me yes i was like.
Give me that right now yeah it's not.
Obviously plans change when you had to.
Come homes we weren't able to get it to.
You right away yes i know you've been.
Texting me updates all the time keeping.
Up with the launch keeping up with their.
Sales and stuff and like tax me a little.
Bit stuff like as someone who was a.
Friend of mine and has been watching at.
All but also someone who was a brand.
Owner and does this all the time do you.
Have any honest advice for me like what.
I do something else in the future.
Because i'm obviously learning a lot.
About launches and like what i can and.
Shouldn't say or how i should react and.
Stuff yeah and opposite this has been.
Quite a learning experience but i'd love.
To hear like what okay and put you wrong.
You'll hear some realty yes so i had to.
Learn this the hard way.
It's like if something ever really does.
Happen or someone really does have an.
Issue is to really hear them out right.
And not get so offended or on the.
Defense so ready for some real tea so.
This happened when my highlighters first.
Launched my delivery people dropped and.
Higher palates we're talking like 30,000.
Units they dropped it off of the.
Forklift without ever telling anyone.
Know every highlighter was shattered so.
Imagine you don't know this right don't.
Know until later when all the units are.
Shipped out so when the first few people.
Were getting them i thought people were.
Just like coming from me like yeah oh.
Well your products are horrible right.
Like i had such success with liquid lips.
And lip scrub so when i brought the.
Highlighter i was so proud of it and.
People were getting broken but it was.
Only one shade the one shade of so.
Someone made a video really going in on.
Me like this whole thing was shattered.
They're awful that it uh and i clap back.
Instead of like listening to the.
Complaint cuz i was like there's no way.
My formula is amazing like you're just.
Trying to lie for attention yeah i.
Should have never done that and i.
Learned my lesson to really respect the.
Customer listen to them but it's hard.
Cuz we talked about being defensive and.
Like and i was it was new it was.
Literally my like one of my long yeah.
First very first launch so to have it go.
And have something go wrong it was.
Devastating so i had to do my research.
And i had to really you know learn well.
I had this like whole likes campbell.
Thing happen i did definitely react.
Right away yeah annoyed by it and.
There's been so many people being like.
Oh my god he's never had a real job so.
He doesn't know how to talk to people.
Every time we know i did work retail.
Beforehand i know how to talk to me -.
Yeah make you talk to people i things.
Like i think huh oh my god first i raise.
My guard let's hack up i think that in.
The social media days when it comes to.
Influencers there's a very very.
Unrealistic expectation that influencers.
I don't have said like a lot of people.
Just think like oh we don't have.
Feelings and that we're all just gonna.
Like if somebody's screaming in our face.
We're just supposed to get over people.
We're selling nirvana.
Right we all really do have feelings.
Right if someone's.
Lying or like saying something i don't.
Know it's hot it's attached i really is.
I'm definitely learning you know i.
Really wanna make people happy with this.
I put my all into it and probably my.
Name is attached so i want to do like.
