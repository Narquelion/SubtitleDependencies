Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel so.
Music.
Cutting right to the point because.
Today's video is definitely gonna be a.
Pretty long one as you can see by the.
Title below this is going to be a.
Full-on unbiased review of the brand new.
Venti by ariana makeup collection so.
Vinci pd actually had their launch party.
Last night in new york city and launched.
This before at midnight and rihanna had.
A big event in manhattan with a.
Beautiful yellow gown which is why i'm.
Wearing this yellow hoodie today which.
You'll be finding out a lot more about.
In monday's video so stay tuned but.
Guess who is not invited to that launch.
Party this sister right here so this.
Morning i hauled my ass out of bed at 6.
A.m. to go to sephora because they.
Invited a bunch of influencers in for.
Early access and i picked up the entire.
Line i paid for everything one of these.
Products myself this video is not.
Sponsored and i'm not being paid to talk.
About it either i just want to do this.
Video because so many of you guys are.
Wondering whether or not these products.
Are gonna be good.
I myself i'm generally wondering if.
These products are gonna be good the.
Fancy beauty campaigns have looked so so.
Beautiful so many beautiful models so.
Much diversity as well and the products.
Generally do look really really good but.
I don't want to be biased i'm going in.
With absolutely no knowledge of anything.
So without further ado grab your pink.
Kitty drink at ease and let's go ahead.
And get started with testing fenty.
Beauty products alright guys so you know.
That i haven't been really using primer.
So much lately i've just been loving.
Using a moisturize skin or right under.
My foundation i feel like it just makes.
My skin look so so beautiful and.
Flawless but 20 beauty did drop a soft.
Matte primer so i already went ahead and.
I moisturize and we're gonna be putting.
This on top before the foundation today.
So all the different products come in at.
This design of a unicorn it is this like.
Off-white black spot an ombre pattern.
Honestly the packaging looks absolutely.
Stunning and let's go ahead and take it.
Oh oh wow this looks really good so i'm.
Fancy viacom this primer retails for $32.
And it comes with one point zero eight.
Fluid ounces which is actually more than.
The typical foundation most foundations.
Are usually one fluid ounce so there's.
Definitely a lot of product in here i'm.
Just gonna go ahead and i'm going to.
Store some on my hands as usual and then.
Just apply them to my face okay so i.
Definitely just applied way too much.
That to my face that are it's gonna blow.
In really really well there isn't too.
Much of like a strong smell but it does.
Smell slightly like lotion but like a.
Really really good lotion so it's.
Definitely a nice clean scent that isn't.
Overpowering oh and it does make my skin.
Feel very very smooth and also a little.
Bit tacky so this should make my makeup.
Stick hopefully pretty well i am so.
Annoyed right now like i said i went to.
Sephora this morning to get the.
Foundation it to show you guys the full.
Range so i got shade number 100 being.
The lightest shade.
And number 490 being the darkest shade.
Of my dumb ass instead of getting my.
Shade which i determined was number 260.
I bought to number hundreds are we.
Surprised no but are we annoyed yes.
Because i have to go all the way back.
There so so you guys are not gonna see.
Any time passed because there's gonna be.
A jump cut but my eyes will be back in.
About two hours - as they do alright so.
Very very long overrides later we are.
Back home and i have the right.
Foundation shade this time number 260.
That's like classic james sorry but.
Flashback mary was clearly really trying.
To make it appearance i've been here but.
Not today.
The nextstep is obviously going to be a.
Foundation and for today i bought you.
Guys three shades and i got number 260.
For myself i did do some swatches in.
Sephora but lord knows the lighting in.
There is not the best so fingers crossed.
This one works but i also picked up.
Number 100 which is the lightest shade.
And number 490 which is the darkest.
Shade so i could show you guys the full.
Range i also went ahead and i picked up.
The precision makeup sponge which i.
Guess is supposed to be like a beauty.
Blender type situation it comes in the.
Philip ox and then is in this package so.
It is basically like a beauty blender.
But it has flat edges so i'm just going.
To go ahead and it actually sounds like.
A bouquet of flowers weird enough but.
Like it smells good i'm gonna go ahead.
And wet this before i apply my.
Foundation so if we're actually applying.
The foundation i do definitely talk.
About the shade range because it has.
Been a very very controversial topic so.
I do want to swatch for you guys the.
Three different colors that i got today.
So this is shade number 100 which is the.
Lightest shade on the top this one is.
Number 260 which fingers crossed should.
Be my shade hopefully.
And this last sheet on the bottom is.
Number 490 which is the darkest shade.
In the range i want to make it very very.
Clear that i'm obviously not a person of.
Color and i'm nowhere near as well i.
Simply wanted to swatch the darker shade.
Just to give you guys a good comparison.
From the darkest to the lightest and.
Show the variation between them but i am.
Well aware that this watch on my.
Skintone is not going to be helpful at.
All to my dark beauties out there so.
While i was in sephora today i did.
Happen to run in one of my amazing.
Sisters shout out to you a sister.
Julienne she definitely saw me.
Struggling with what to do with this.
Foundation so she actually went ahead.
And let me swatch it on her hand.
So hopefully this next step will give.
You guys a better idea if you do have.
Darker skin on what this foundation will.
Actually look like alright guys i'm here.
At plenty beauty and support to pick up.
All the items early this morning and i'm.
Here with sister jolene i want to show.
You guys the darker shade in the range.
Because there are so many but obviously.
I'm pacey so i'm glad about the swatches.
Are you    on me because but doesn't.
Help anybody so sister tati is gonna.
Hold my camera for me a little swatch to.
Devon today alright guys so this is.
Shades are bent 490 which is the darkest.
In the range and to be clear we're on.
Essentially did run out of more shape as.
Well those definitely controversy on.
Twitter when it comes to makeup but.
Literally 1s or not so we're gonna be.
Watching this sister lena right here.
Before looks definitely pretty liquidy.
And as you can tell this is a little bit.
Darker than her skin tone and this is.
Definitely a warm tone shade too alright.
So now that that's taken care of let's.
Go ahead and actually apply the.
Foundation like i said i am number 260.
And this foundation comes with one point.
Zero eight fluid ounces so same exact.
Thing as the primer but this one is $34.
Rather than the primer is 32 i'm just.
Gonna dip in with my venti beauty sponge.
And go right in on at the skin alright.
So first impressions is that this color.
Is a pretty good match to my skin so.
Thank god the sephora lighting to not do.
Me too dirty today but fingers crossed.
That it does not oxidize i'm already not.
Really loving this sponge.
It's definitely leaving like imprint as.
You can see like right there where i'm.
Tapping it in and i think that's because.
This does have a flat edge to it which.
Would be really really helpful for doing.
Like under-eye concealer i feel like but.
I feel like the flash is definitely.
Leaving some weird imprints in the.
Foundation so i'm not sure if i really.
Like this alright so that was about.
Three pumps this is what i normally do.
For my foundation but we are nowhere.
Even close to being a full coverage yet.
I literally only covered one cheek and.
Like this area on this side of the face.
So i am gonna do a little bit more so.
That is one coat of foundation fully.
Applied all over the face and it's.
Giving me like very medium coverage i am.
Definitely gonna add a little bit more.
In areas that are still a little bit.
See-through but honestly first.
Impressions i really like how this.
Foundation looks alright so that's the.
Foundation all applied and obviously we.
Have to wear this and see how it works.
Throughout the day but initial reactions.
Is that i really really like it it looks.
Really really good on my skintone my.
Skin feels nice and smooth and it feels.
Very very weightless too like i don't.
Feel like i'm wearing a lot of.
Foundation despite the fact that i.
Definitely just had to do like 10 or 15.
Pumps of this to get full coverage which.
Definitely is a con so if you're okay.
With using a lot of foundation to cover.
Yourself with still feeling light that's.
Good but just know that you're only.
Getting one point zero eight fluid.
Ounces for the price pretty good but.
Still you're gonna use a lot of.
Foundation so you could go through this.
Very very quickly so the next up is.
Gonna be to conceal and contour my face.
But i'm actually gonna skip out on.
Concealing for just one second actually.
Move to contour because today we're.
Gonna be using a cream contour from.
Fenty beauty and this is the match stick.
And the shade suede each one of these.
Little cream sticks comes for.
Twenty-five dollars each and you get.
0.25 ounces of product so definitely not.
A whole lot but let's go ahead and cream.
Contour our face today.
It's gonna blend this out using the.
Sponge alright so as you can see i just.
Tried to blend that in but instead of.
Really like blending in it kind of.
Disappeared and i think that's because.
The foundation is getting layered over.
Top of it this sponge is obviously.
Soaking up a lot of product which is.
Definitely why it took 10 to 15 squirts.
Of foundation to get full coverage but i.
Think we got a switch over to my regular.
Beauty blender to finish blending this.
Out let's try this again okay i'm not.
Loving this.
It's definitely blending out a lot.
Easier using my regular beauty blender.
As opposed to the venti beauty sponge.
But honestly i'm still really not loving.
This i'm having to pound really really.
Hard to even get the product to move i.
Really kind of already dried down.
Completely which for the foundation i.
Like because i have not set my face yet.
With powder but it looks really really.
Good alright i'm back my camera decided.
Of course literally what else would go.
Wrong today at this point but i did just.
Go ahead and apply my concealer which.
Was a tar shape tape i was gonna pick up.
One of the matchsticks similar to the.
Cream contour and a concealer but i'll.
Just be straight up i tried it in.
Support today and i absolutely hated the.
Formula i just felt as though it wasn't.
Soft enough to be able to really use for.
Under-eye concealer i just thought i was.
Gonna take off the foundation and.
Honestly at this point i'm really really.
Glad i went with that decision because.
Obviously i did not really like this.
Formula and using its shape tape with.
This fancy foundation looks so good like.
My skin looks absolutely phenomenal.
Right now i have not even set with any.
Powder i'm not creasing it it dried down.
To like a semi matte finish it's not.
Completely matte but it's also a.
Slightest bit dewy this looks really.
Good alright so next i'm gonna go in and.
I'm going to set my face so to do that.
I'm gonna be using the fenty beauty.
Invisi matte universal blotting powder.
And there's only one shade in this and.
It is very very light so i am praying.
That flash like mary does not come i.
Mean she clearly was trying it with a.
Shade 100 of the foundation so fingers.
Crossed that this does not give us the.
Worst luck ever under cinder grab my.
Morphe i'm a 335 brush and tap into this.
And i'm going to use this to set.
Underneath my eyes just make sure that i.
Don't get any creases i'm next just.
Gonna grab my morphe m14 one and dip.
Into the pan to set the rest my face and.
Whoa as you can see when you dip the.
Brush in it definitely comes off as a.
White powder this is getting very very.
Scary but when you blend it and i'm.
Assuming it turns.
Pretty transparent yeah so hopefully we.
Will get any flower shock but like i.
Said i will definitely take a photo and.
Show you guys in a few or short seconds.
Alright so as you can see for the photos.
I just inserted this powder is.
Definitely flashback proof thank god.
Where i lightly dusted the powder just.
To set my face and modify it my skin.
Tone looked exactly the same so if that.
Is an a+ and where i did really really.
Pack it on being the center of the.
Forehead chin and under the eyes like i.
Normally do it did flash back the.
Slightest bit and light not my skin tone.
But that's exactly what i wanted it to.
Do so this powder is a major win and.
Definitely going in my bag when i go.
Places as well for light touch-ups okay.
So now that my face is all set in place.
Oh we love a good poet i'm gonna quickly.
Go ahead and do my brows off-camera.
Fenty did not launch any brow products.
With this original lion so i'm just.
Gonna use my normal benefit brow poets.
And i'll be right back to start off the.
Eyes alright so i just went ahead and i.
Did my brows off-camera quickly to save.
Time and then i just stir on this.
Orangie brown halo eye with the fenty.
Launched she actually did not launch any.
Eye shadow palettes or single shadows.
Just highlighters so i wanted to throw.
This on as a base and then i'm gonna.
Grab the matchstick not the concealer in.
The shade star-struck which is like this.
Pinky glittery shade it honestly.
Swatches really really beautifully and.
I'm pretty sure this is less be used as.
A cream highlighter for the cheeks but.
It is definitely a little bit darker for.
My skin tone as you can see when i.
Rotate my hand it definitely gives that.
Grey cast that nobody wants for a.
Highlighter so this is definitely look a.
Lot better on darker skins but i'm gonna.
Use it to highlight the center of my.
Eyelids today now it looks really good.
Oh my gosh i'm just gonna grab my morphe.
M22 4 brush and dip into the top of that.
Cream highlighter and just use this to.
Blend out the edges lightly oh this is.
Really pretty i'm also gonna grab my.
Pinky finger and try applying it this.
Way too to see how that works this is a.
Match stick as well so it's also $25.
Like i said for the first one the cream.
Contour and a fun side note these are.
Magnetic and stick together which i.
Think is so cool and a really good.
Storage option as well so major points.
To them for that so those are the eyes.
All complete i'm absolutely loving how.
This is turning out so far and now we're.
Onto the stuff that we've all been.
Waiting for and that is the highlighter.
And i am so so so excited for this so.
Frenchie beauty actually launched a few.
Different highlighters retailing at $34.
Each and you get 0.12 ounces of product.
And i actually picked up two of.
This duo comes with two shades being a.
Lightning dust and fire crystal.
Definitely plus for the names please.
Excuse my crusty ass bandit but here's a.
Shade lightning dust swatch we're gonna.
Do it right here.
That's not even showing up on camera and.
It's actually really not that pigmented.
In real life.
Okay and then here's the shade of fire.
Crystal also swatched.
Alright so fire crystals definitely a.
Lot more pigmented and a little bit more.
Glittery than lightning dust days i'm.
Actually pretty disappointed in.
Lightning dust it really does not show.
Up that well on camera or in real life.
So if you want a more subtle highlighter.
This may be for you but when you're like.
Me and you like a blinding glow i think.
We might be going for a fire crystal but.
Even this is really not that landing.
Either the second highlighter however is.
When we've been waiting for and this is.
What i am so so excited to use today and.
That is the single highlighter in the.
Shade trophy wife it is this like.
Metallic ass gold shade that is i guess.
More even glittery than hi lady oh.
You're kidding wow.
So read is actually writing this exact.
Highlighter at last night at the event.
Which looked so beyond stunning and.
After being a little bit of research.
What i'm gathering is that this.
Highlighter is actually more of like a.
Glittery base rather than an actual like.
Shimmer base so when you put it on it's.
Supposed to actually disperse more like.
Real glitter and look like your face is.
Like literally glittery rather than like.
Glowing so definitely not for the.
Everyday person but y'all know me i love.
To be extra af and i am so excited to.
Try this and let's give her a little bit.
Of a swatch with a clean finger oh.
You're kidding let's go ahead and move.
The cartier bracelet down and do a.
Little oh wow i don't know if it's.
Picking up on camera but in real life.
You can see the individual glitter.
Particles like shining and that is so.
Stunning oh my god i am so pumped for.
This i'm gonna go in with my morphe m.
501 brush and dip into trophy wife and.
See how this looks.
Alright so the highlighter is definitely.
There was only one swipe and i'm already.
Glowing but as you can see i definitely.
Had a lot my brush i was able to blend.
It out too which is great because some.
People obviously are not gonna want this.
Full-on glittery.
Glam highlight but y'all know me i need.
To be x-ray app so i'm gonna dip back in.
It once again and layer more on top for.
That gold glitter effect oh my god wow.
I'm gonna go ahead and apply it to my.
Normal areas as.
Well being the brow bones okay so i was.
Super super excited for this highlighter.
But after putting it on let's be real.
This is definitely not for my skin tone.
It is way too dark and way too golden as.
Well which is great because that means.
That this will fit all my dark sisters.
Out there so so beautifully so if you.
Guys get this and try on it definitely.
Send me all the tweets and pics so i can.
Be jealous of your envious golden glow.
But this highlighter definitely not for.
Me i'm actually gonna go back into this.
Duo and into a fire crystal and try that.
Instead i'm just going with my morphe m.
405 ushe and i'm gonna quickly go over.
Just the highlight area to try to blend.
It out a little bit and make it look and.
Not as intense because this golden glow.
Is a little bit too golden okay so.
Instead i'm gonna grab a clean m5a1.
Brush and dip into a fire crystal from.
That duo that i just showed you guys and.
Try this one instead oh yeah that's a.
Lot better side note to if you have.
Nails these are really really hard to.
Open oh my god i'm like scared that i'm.
Gonna snap one i'm gonna save my final.
Thoughts at the end but the last step is.
Obviously going to be at the lip fitted.
Doodahs and for today i'm gonna be using.
The venti glow lip gloss which i've.
Heard is literally so so good so i'm.
Very very excited to put this on so with.
This gloss you get point three ounces of.
Product in its $18 so definitely not a.
Bad deal so the shade of this lip gloss.
Is definite like a muted mauve shade.
Which i absolutely love and there are.
Little flecks of gold that are in here.
Too for that high shine look so i'm.
Super excited to put this on oh wow.
Okay so i don't know if this is reading.
On camera but in person this lip is.
Literally so shiny that it almost looks.
Like a metallic lipstick but i really.
Don't hate it because i'm kind of living.
For the gloss so i actually didn't layer.
This gloss over anything because that's.
How it was marketed in the fenty.
Campaign i'm pretty sure all the models.
How there's over there natural lip.
Colors and for me the formula is really.
Really nice but i'm really not loving.
The color that it's giving my lips it.
Doesn't look bad but i just feel like it.
Doesn't really match with this i look so.
Maybe if i layered it over top of.
Something it would look better but as.
For the actual lip lost formula and feel.
I like it i'm gonna finish off by spritz.
My face using my urban decay all nighter.
Setting spray just to lock everything in.
Place and that is the full face of.
Fenty products okay so let's go back and.
Recap for those you sisters who are.
Interested in buying the primer and.
Foundation one hundred and fifty percent.
I love this my skin looks so good i.
Barely had a powder on my face and it.
Dried down so so nicely the shade match.
Is really really good i look golden and.
Bronzy and like my texture is not.
Showing my pores look good i love this.
And this honestly and maybe replacing my.
Makeup forever and two-phase duo but.
You'll have to stay tuned in find out.
I'm gonna keep braiding this look.
Throughout the day so i will definitely.
Tweet and stop and keep you guys posted.
As to how it wears but as of right now i.
Love this next product we uses the.
Universal invisible adding powder which.
I actually use for setting powder i am.
Once again love this as well it was.
Super super lightweight and even though.
It is a light color which definitely had.
Me a little spooked at first it does not.
Give any flash back which is so great.
And definitely did a really good job of.
Mattifying my skin and keeping.
Everything in please that was rude like.
I said at the foundation did write down.
A pretty matte so i really do not need a.
Lot of this but this will definitely be.
Going in might touch-up bag for when i.
Go to events because i love this the.
Next product we used the next product we.
Tested out was one of the matchsticks.
And this is one of the contour shades i.
Picked out suede and this for me it was.
More of a fail so the next product we.
Used was the matchstick and i picked up.
The shade its way to do my cream.
Contouring and definitely i was a little.
Bit biased considering i don't really.
Like cream products to begin with but.
This was not for me at all i really did.
Not like the formula of these it's not.
Bad by any means but i just focus on how.
To work really really hard to really.
Blend this out and even after blending.
It i still felt like it was a little bit.
Patchy so i definitely would not be.
Recommending this match stick or the.
Sponge as well i forgot to mention this.
But this is just overall a big no it.
Really did not do that good of a job of.
Blending out i feel like i had to work.
Really really hard at it and also this.
Soaks up way too much product too as you.
Guys saw had to use like 15 pumps of.
Foundation to get a full face which is.
Never ever the move and it's gonna run.
You out of that foundation so fast $34.
Is definitely a lot of money to be.
Sending on a foundation so i would avoid.
Getting this because you're gonna waste.
It to spend the extra four dollars and.
Get the regular beauty blender and save.
Yourself a whole lot of time and product.
So even though this matchstick was a.
Major fail for me this match tip in the.
Shade.
Stardust was a major major win it is.
Once again a cream stick and it is.
Supposed to be a highlighter but instead.
Of using it on my face i did use it as.
My eye shadow to be my center highly of.
My halo eye and oh my god like i said.
Before i love how this looks and it's.
Super super pigmented as you can see and.
Similar.
The contour it was kind of hard to blend.
Out but for an eyeshadow look that's.
Really really great because as you can.
See it's really not transferring it's.
Saying exactly where i put it and just.
The edges were able to people ended up.
With that perfect.
Glowy halo eye i definitely would.
Recommend this one so the next part if.
We try it out were at the frenchy beauty.
Highlighters and these were a major fail.
Once again i'm so sad because i was.
Really really looking forward to these.
Especially the shade at trophy wife.
All the models wearing it last night.
Looked so stunning with their gold.
Glittery highlights but it was.
Definitely way too dark for me honestly.
It really not mad at it at all it's.
About damn time a brand comes out with a.
Lot of products meant for a darker skin.
Tone so definitely if you are later skin.
Tone would not recommend but if you're a.
Dark beauty these highlighters would be.
It's so good for you.
That's what the other highlighter duo.
This one was a major fail for me as well.
As you saw the shade lightning dust.
Really doesn't have any pigment at all.
And then the shade of fire crystal was.
Super super beautiful but as you can see.
It's on my face and it is looking a.
Little bit grayish white um i was.
Expecting this to be a little bit more.
Champagne e but it's definitely looking.
A little bit too pale so for me i would.
Have loved to have a highlighter in the.
Middle of these two because this is too.
Dark and this is way too light slash.
Gray so hopefully rihanna will come up.
With a lot more things but for me the.
Highlighters where i fail and last but.
Certainly not least we try to feed vent.
A beauty gloss and i love this like i.
Was saying i wish i layered this over.
Top of a liquid lipstick or regular.
Lipstick because i'm not loving the.
Color that it gave me to match with this.
Look muttering a side though because.
That's my fault the formula itself i.
Absolutely love it feels very very.
Comfortable and lightweight on my lips.
And not sticky which is literally the.
Best thing in the entire world and yeah.
I really really like this and this will.
Definitely going in my bag as well.
Alright sister so that has the full.
Fanta beauty products i'll try to and.
Reviewed definitely become a down below.
And tell me which product you like best.
And what you're dying to try it as well.
Overall after trying all these products.
I think there are only two things in.
Total that i really didn't love and they.
Were still not bad at all just.
Definitely not for my makeup preference.
So love that i also love the fact that.
There are 40 foundation shades oh my god.
I can't stress enough once again thank.
All the beauty brands are finally.
Starting to target towards with darker.
Skin tones and people of color it is.
