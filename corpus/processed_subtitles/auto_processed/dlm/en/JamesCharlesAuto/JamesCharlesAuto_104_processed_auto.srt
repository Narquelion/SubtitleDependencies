Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel so it.
Has been a hot moment since i've.
Uploaded on my youtube channel i am so.
Sorry if you guys can follow me on.
Instagram and snapchat you would know.
That i just actually finally after a.
Million years graduated once and for all.
I did technically graduate early a few.
Months back but i just went home back to.
New york for the first time into four or.
Five months since actually moving to.
California and i walk to the rest of my.
Class for my graduation and it was kind.
Of iconic normally what i know i'm gonna.
Travel i agree film videos for you guys.
But this time i had a lot of really.
Exciting meetings and stuff going on.
Beforehand for products that'll be.
Coming out soon so i didn't get a chance.
To pre film but i promise when you find.
Out what i've been doing on the dl it'll.
Be worth that well it was an amazing.
Trip i was definitely ready for it to be.
Over with by at the end of it and i.
Definitely missed being on my la a grind.
Working every single day so i'm finally.
Back home and i decided to sit down and.
Film a video for you guys today i.
Tweeted asking you guys what you wanted.
To see because i wasn't really feeling.
Any makeup inspiration at the current.
Moment and so many of you guys had to do.
A a q&a now you guys know i'm pretty.
Much an open book.
I am so open and honest with everything.
That goes on in my life y'all basically.
Know every single aspect of it.
Especially if you are a loyal snap fan.
Follower so i kind of was do something a.
Little bit different so for today's q&a.
I thought i would do a q&a based on what.
It's like being a social-media.
Influencer in questions that nobody.
Really wants to answer i tweeted asking.
You guys to send me harsh honest and.
Hard questions to answer and i actually.
Got so many cool ones so i'm super.
Excited for this and we're gonna talk.
About everything from how much money i.
Make to i like meeting fans weirdest.
Experiences and everything under the sun.
Of what it's like to be a social-media.
Influencer so if you want to hear what i.
Have to say on this and answer some.
Really really honest question make sure.
You keep on watching laci asked are most.
Beauty gurus  social media influencers.
A lot different in real life than they.
Present themselves on a camera okay so.
Yes and no for the most part beauty.
Gurus everybody is like the exact same.
As they are on camera in real life if.
Anything we just make a lot more jokes.
And can be a lot more ourselves because.
We kind of understand what goes on.
Within the actual industry but for other.
Social media areas of like the spectrum.
In different careers and stuff i.
Say more no i've met a lot of people.
That are in the beauty industry that are.
So completely different as they are on.
Camera in real life but never in like a.
Way that i've been it disappointed or.
Upset it's just mostly in a way to like.
Protect their image and to like keep.
Their audience satisfied if that makes.
Sense.
Loie asked are you ever cautious about.
Surrounding yourself with people from.
The industry like seeing the beef  dawa.
247 online it doesn't make you guarded.
Abso-fucking-lutely they're like maybe.
Three people total this industry that i.
Actually trust i have a lot of super.
Super close friends but it's so sad to.
Say that you can never really really.
Trust anybody so i am super careful of.
Who i really trust and talk to i think.
Finding that group of people that you.
Can really really trust is super super.
Important in this industry as many of.
You guys know watching from an outside.
Perspective this industry is crazy and.
Has so much horrifying drama so it's.
Really really important to find their.
Cup of people that you know you could.
Love and trust and always look to when.
Times get tough because trust me they do.
We can ask when people are sponsored and.
They say it's their honest opinion of.
The product is it actually no obviously.
It's gonna depend on the person you're.
Watching i can only speak for myself.
Here but in my case yes it is always.
Honest if you guys look through my email.
And saw the amount of money and offers.
That is given on a daily basis you would.
Probably be freaking shook to the core.
So many brands reach out to social media.
Influencers about campaigns but i reject.
Actually like 90% of them i'm very very.
Blessed and thankful to have you guys.
And have a lot of different sources of.
Income from all across nine platforms so.
For me and many other influencers brand.
Deals are not saying that it's like.
Super vital to me to be waiting for the.
Next paycheck however the ones that i do.
Do are the ones that i actually really.
Do care about so if i do like the.
Product i will definitely do the brand.
Deal take the money for and give an open.
And honest review so if somebody's.
Reviewing a product is usually because.
They genuinely do like it i definitely.
Did get twisted sometimes between some.
People but like i said i could only.
Really speak for myself here so if you.
Guys are seeing your review product and.
Say that i like it and if i'm being paid.
Obviously i do like it because i'm like.
It what dan asked has dating changed a.
Lot for you since you've gotten so big.
And two boys treat you differently you.
Guys know that boys and dating a tunnel.
Has never really been a strong suit of.
Mine or like a.
I'm pretty bad at it so it hasn't really.
Changed in the fact that i'm still.
Single as    however i have noticed a.
Lot more guy type of social-climbing me.
Which is so sad and so like gross to.
Even think about but i've just learned.
To be really really careful with who i.
Trust and try to date guys that are like.
On the same type of like social spectrum.
As me i know that sounds so.
Shitty to say but you have to think of.
It from my perspective it's really scary.
To like really trust somebody and let.
Somebody in if they have a lower amount.
Of followers it's because you really.
Don't know what their true intentions.
Are so it's much easier to talk to.
People that are on like the same.
Wavelength or at least like in the.
Social media realm i really hope that.
Doesn't come across really pretentious.
And shitty follower count at the end.
That he means nothing to me my future.
Husband might have zero followers who.
Freakin cares i'm just saying from a.
Trust and weight it's a lot easier to.
Talk to and trust people that have a.
Little bit more of a social following.
Just so you are a little bit more sure.
That there's nothing going on on the dl.
Maya asked what is it like to go from.
Nobody caring about your mistakes to.
Everyone pointed them out and.
Criticizing you if you guys have been.
Following me for a while especially on.
Twitter you know that i have definitely.
I've gotten myself in a lot of a pretty.
Pretty awful and offensive scandals to.
Answer your question it's halfway really.
Annoying but to also i'm very.
Very thankful for it and let me tell you.
Why the part that i absolutely hate is.
Really really old content a lot of the.
Scandals that i've gotten involved in.
People love to freaking dig up the past.
And old tweets and old stuff and just.
Use them against me now for me.
Personally the tweets that were pulled.
Up were from a 2013 they were gross and.
They were really really offensive and i.
Have since apologized for them i am not.
Making any excuses for them because they.
Should not happen said or i came out of.
My mouth and i definitely should have.
Known better however that being said.
There is literally no human being in the.
Entire world that has the same person.
They were five years ago or was the same.
Person that they were when they were 13.
Years old five years ago i was just an.
Average everyday middle schooler with.
Like a hundred followers on twitter they.
Were all for my school i didn't know.
What it's like to have a social.
Following i didn't have anybody watching.
Me i didn't have anybody looking up to.
Me so it was a very very different world.
I said a lot of really really gross.
Things that i shouldn't have said and.
Also a lot of things that i didn't.
Really understand the true impact or.
Underlying meaning of and that's just.
Because they didn't grow up with a lot.
Of diversity around me but now i know.
That those things are shitty and wrong.
Which is why i have apologized and why.
I'm addressing them.
But it definitely does suck to have.
Things keep getting pulled up constantly.
When you've already tried to move on.
Educate yourself and just be a better.
Person in general.
I definitely will always like reread it.
My tweets and snapchats before i post.
Daily because i have so many of you guys.
Watch me i'm looking up to me which is a.
Really really huge weight on my.
Shoulders but it's something that i am.
So thankful for and something that i am.
So proud of to be leading such an.
Amazing community i would never want to.
Degrade and disappoint or i find anybody.
On purpose i am i'm so thankful that i.
Now have you guys to call me out when i.
Up so i can further educate myself.
And just be a better person in general.
Christian asks if all of your followers.
Disappeared overnight and you lost all.
Your influence would you still continue.
To do what you love without a platform i.
Definitely think so yes but maybe not as.
Frequently have you guys been following.
Me for a while on instagram you know.
That i kind of started doing a lot of.
More creative and avant-garde style.
Looks and that's really where my heart.
Lies i talked about this before on my.
Channel but i really don't like doing.
Glam that much and i usually only do.
Actual like glam when it comes to events.
And filming youtube videos just because.
That's what really performs well and.
That's what looks pretty for like photos.
And red carpet and stuff so i probably.
Wouldn't do it as frequently and i'd.
Probably only be doing makeup when it.
Came to like the creative artsy a crazy.
Type looks but i definitely still be.
Doing makeup for sure because i love it.
And this is like my hobby and well now.
My job but if it wasn't my job i would.
Still love it if that makes sense.
Jayla asked how much money do you get.
For brand sponsorships no this is the.
Question that nobody ever answers but i.
Know everybody wants to know but i'll.
Tell you why they don't answer and.
That's because it's actually illegal.
When we do branded or sponsorship videos.
We always have to sign contracts that.
Say we're not gonna discuss how much.
Money we're being paid or what's going.
On behind the scenes aside from the.
Actual content that you guys are seeing.
On our instagram pages now i've worked.
On campaigns and products before that i.
Absolutely cannot discuss the financials.
Of it is illegal i'm not trying to get.
Sued in any way shape or form but i will.
Tell you without giving any further.
Detail that the most i've ever been paid.
When it came to his sponsored youtube.
Video was in the six-figure digits.
Leo asked how much money have companies.
Offered you to post about them on your.
Social media at the end of the day.
Yograj trust is a lot more important to.
Me than any amount of money i will say.
That i have declined several over.
$1,000,000 offers because it wasn't.
Saying that would fit my brand cemet.
Asked be real how many of the people.
You've collabed with are you actually.
Friends with slash come to earth outside.
Of.
Every single one of them ryan asked how.
Many times have you cried because of.
Hate zero nikki asked do you actually.
Like to meet your fans or does it get.
Annoying sometimes if you guys have any.
Person you know that i freaking love me.
Too you guys so so so so so so so much.
It just makes me so happy to be able to.
Put a name to the face of all the people.
That have been supporting me since day.
One and it truly does warm my heart and.
Make my day i love me too you guys i.
Love taking pictures but i will say that.
The 1% of the time i    hate it is.
When i'm eating nothing bothers me more.
Than when i'm about to stick my fork.
Into like a nice juicy steak her he's.
Some delicious french fries and ketchup.
And my coke then when i see somebody.
From the other side of the restaurant.
Kind of take a slight picture like this.
Because if i'm not gonna see yeah that.
Really really bothers me i just feel.
Like eating it's like a time of having a.
Good time with your friends and family.
And just like it's just very very.
Disrespectful in general so if you see.
Me in public please ask me to take a.
Picture i would love to freakin meet you.
I will give you the biggest hug people.
Take an amazing selfie just please if.
I'm eating wait until i'm done and the.
Last question for today at kalyan asked.
Do you love your job to end this video.
On a positive note.
Abso-fucking-lutely i am so thankful to.
Be living my dreams and living this.
Amazing life at only 18 years old so.
Many people can't even say when they're.
Older that they do their dream job and.
Here i am being very very young freshly.
Out of high school and just having an.
Amazing time and having all of you guys.
Watch and support me it really does mean.
So much to all you guys are there on the.
Other side of the camera and even though.
There are hard days i wouldn't trade.
This for the world.
If you guys are like a loyal beauty.
Community fan you know there's a lot of.
Really shitty and annoying and awful.
Stuff that goes down in this industry it.
Definitely is a very very cutthroat and.
Hard place to survive but i would not.
Still be here if i didn't love what i.
Did trust me on that one alright guys.
And that is all i have for this video.
Today my phone just died sorry i'm all.
Out of questions like i said before i am.
Very much an open and honest book being.
A social-media influencer definitely has.
Its pros and it's cons there's some.
Amazing days there is good pay good.
Friends and cool opportunities but at.
The same time there's a lot of heat and.
Really really shitty situations that we.
All get ourselves into so it's.
Definitely a crazy world that i live in.
But i'm very very thankful to be where i.
Am thanks to you guys i really hope you.
