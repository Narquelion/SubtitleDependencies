Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel in.
The comment on my videos i get a lot of.
Requests to do other videos and most of.
The time they make sense and are great.
Ideas and then there's videos like the.
One we're gonna be doing today i do not.
Understand why you guys keep asking me.
To do cooking videos but here we are i.
James charles can not cook i'm admitting.
It right now before i even get into this.
Okay it is just not a skill that i have.
In my repertoire if you will i post.
Mates three out of three meals of the.
Day it's just not really a skill that.
I've ever like gotten good at but that.
Being said okay i love cooking i love.
The food network i watch the bone.
Appetit videos on youtube all day every.
Single day and on a more serious note.
Obviously the world right now is in a.
Little bit of a crisis we're dealing.
With a copa 19 also known as the.
Provirus.
And a lot of places such as la are on.
Lockdown and we can't really leave our.
Houses that also means a lot of.
Restaurants are closed down as well now.
If you guys know me you know my favorite.
Food of all time is cannes and it's only.
Four items on the menu it is fried.
Chicken french fries coleslaw and texas.
Toast and oh my god it is literally the.
Best food on the entire planet but right.
Now i can't get it okay i'm deprived i.
Want it more than anything so for.
Today's video i'm here in my kitchen and.
I'm gonna try to recreate a kane's me.
All from scratch hopefully while we're.
Learning this together you guys can pick.
Up some fun cooking at tips and.
Techniques so you guys can be self.
Efficient and we can all do our best at.
Isolating cooking and providing for.
Ourselves of being independent sisters.
So yeah if you want to watch me try not.
To burn down my house and hopefully cook.
Some really delicious food keep on.
Watching.
Music.
All right so to prepare this recipe.
Today i'm going to open my sister's.
Laptop and actually found a recipe.
Online by the website healthy junk food.
Which shallots then they're an amazing.
Channel here on youtube actually not.
Done a few weeks why playlists they were.
Super super nice and they have a recipe.
On how to recreate cannes so i'm gonna.
Be following this i'll leave the link.
Down below in case any of you guys want.
To recreate it as well but let's go.
Ahead and get started.
It said this is only gonna take 10.
Minutes to prepare and four minutes to.
Cook yeah i guarantee all will be here.
For at least two hours together so sit.
Down side well but you know hope that.
This turns out good our ingredients are.
Going to be some nice chicken breasts.
Two cups of flour some salt sitting on.
Our 2 eggs 2 cups of buttermilk which we.
Could not find so we have a regular milk.
We also have half in half butter i'm not.
Really sure if we can like combine.
Butter and mill to make buttermilk that.
Might be one of the most ignorant.
Sentence ever.
But do you know what we're gonna figure.
It out because we have to make do with.
What we got and then finally one.
Tablespoon of garlic powder let's make.
Some check-in before we think it started.
On the chicken the first thing that i.
Want to do is put my oil into my pot so.
I can get heated up and ready to fry by.
The time that i'm done prepping at the.
Chicken another slight issue that we ran.
Into.
We don't have vegetable oil which is.
What you're supposed to fry things in we.
Only have olive oil so i'm not even sure.
If this is gonna work to be quite honest.
With you i feel like a shed so i'm just.
Way to take my oil hi guys.
Nice olive oil drink we're gonna first.
Do a lot about is it olive oil all the.
Recipe at first said this is exact word.
Cut your thick juicy chicken breasts.
Into straps oh can i open this here.
Those chicken juices everywhere okay.
We're gonna cut these into some nice.
Strips so we're gonna take our bowl and.
Some nice natural eggs doesn't the.
Problem mean they're natural really yeah.
What is the brown egg mean that's what i.
Meant.
Now what do i do for the buttermilk.
Let's go black or 1 cup of milk into a.
Bowl i'll grab one small fresh lemon or.
White vinegar this mixture will get us.
Thick and creamy as better enough but it.
Will perform its role in the batter just.
As well what about great and one.
Tablespoon of garlic powder.
That's how you ask you just like right.
Like little circular motion it's like.
Blending eyeshadow now we're going to.
Take our chicken breasts and we're going.
To put it in our saw our sauce and the.
Healthy junk food website says that we.
Need to refrigerate it for two to four.
Hours so we're gonna go ahead and put.
This in our refrigerator for two to four.
Minutes cuz i did not and we're gonna.
Make our dry mixture to actually do the.
Fry we need 2 cups of all-purpose flour.
1 cup of seasoned breadcrumbs i love.
Bread crumbs 2 teaspoons of salt and.
Then also treat the 2 teaspoons of salt.
And then 2 teaspoons of baking powder ok.
So now our dry ingredients are all.
Complete so we're gonna get started on.
Our french fry kane's fries are really.
Good but i will say that they're nothing.
Like crazy.
I was literally planning on just doing.
Like the frozen crinkle-cut fries that.
You can get from the grocery store and.
Of course those were also missing so.
There's gonna be a lot harder than it.
Needed to be i was so sure we had pickle.
In the fridge right here oh are you.
Serious a little bit frozen now while.
We're ready for the oven to preheat for.
Our nicely pre-made french fries thank.
God i'm gonna work on making it at the.
Kane's on hopefully my next sentence is.
Not offend anybody but i don't love king.
Sauce i'm very much a catch up in.
Barbecue type of girl but i know a lot.
Of people are right or dies and maybe if.
I make my own it won't be that bad so.
We're gonna actually try it today.
No wonder the mayonnaise you you you.
Absolutely not is that what's in it.
That's why i hate it babies is.
Disgusting i am not doing a cup of.
Mayonnaise littell you down right now.
That is enough for me out of ketchup.
What is what's worse desire sauce you.
Know this is disgusting really that's.
Definitely yeah like that is that skin.
Sauce okay where do we put the fries.
Enough gonna go ahead and put our fries.
Enough so the chicken is marinated for a.
Lovely 20 minutes roughly we're not.
Gonna put it into our dry mixture and.
We're going to get a nice amount of a.
Coating on there now it goes back into.
The wet mixture again and now back into.
The dry mixture once again for our.
Second layer let's just fast you know.
I'm just gonna repeat this with all of.
Our chicken strips and then we'll pop.
Them into the fire so in the ground of.
Our care of hogs and we're going to do a.
Little test strip here i'll grab this.
Nice one oh no that's fine oh my god did.
I do it.
Okay it worked i just let it sit in.
There deep fryer three to four minutes.
I'll leave it at that i put these and.
Just leave it oh turn down the volume or.
Slightly the volume oh wow.
Once it's smoking here okay.
A few moments later oh that is cold it.
Was cooking for one minute i'm gonna go.
Out on a limb and say your oil burned.
Cut the cameras lay down we have one.
Chicken breast laughs that is on birds.
So we are going to make this our last.
Attempt at making cans before we.
Livingstone mcdonald's which is open.
During this course so we found a meat.
Thermometer in our drawer which is great.
Because in there we're good okay that's.
A good tender does look pretty good yeah.
That's what could never go to remzi.
Shaking giada home still at home cuz.
She's quarantined but i love her this.
Time step which is going to be their.
Canes toast the best part of the entire.
Meal oh my god i would literally go to.
Cannes if it just meant eating the toast.
Like i'd be completely throw that it's a.
Full meal in my book.
And we're gonna try our best to recreate.
It today i don't even think we can get.
Anywhere close i don't know what they.
Bake it way that it must be magic for.
Rich rot so so we have our two slices of.
Bread and kane's bread is known for.
Being a both like really really sweet.
And salty at the same time so our bread.
Is of course a little bit salty and we.
Got some garlic flavored infused extra.
Virgin olive oil i'm just going to put.
Into here so it's gonna take a little.
Cooking a brush what is this like a nice.
Like a c-47 seven products crab some.
Butter from the tub really brush it on.
There giving the bread a nice coating.
Perhaps a stippling motion for all you.
Makeup lovers out there a little bit of.
Extra virgin olive oil extra virgin just.
Like me unfortunately and lots of.
Pauline at least we're gonna pop our.
Bread into the oven to toast for like.
Four to five ish to eight depending on.
How long this takes to cook with it so.
Dunno alright you guys we are finally.
Done that with this kane's diy meal.
Contrary to the blog that we read it did.
Not take fourteen minutes but rather two.
Hours time for the taste test this was a.
Roller coaster to get here but i will.
See the finished plate in front of us.
Looks like no that bad let's try the.
Thighs first pick your like fine.
French fry whatever i will see your.
Chicken tenders do not work out great.
The first time everything but this one.
Looks okay take a look inside fully.
Cooked taken a little bit of king sauce.
Music.
Oh you are kidding you've gotta be.
Kidding me there is no way that after.
All that this tastes good i'm speechless.
Take some lemonade don't know our toast.
No not even close i'm so bad it's just.
Not nothing can come truly compete with.
Canes it's not it's too sweet there's.
Not nearly enough salt it was just so.
Good oh my god this is so good.
Well i wish i had all the tundra's and.
Not only just one yo so good no although.
You guys will most like that is our diy.
Canes meal all completes this process.
Today it was really something like it.
Says begin this video i just don't.
Understand why you guys keep requesting.
Cooking videos i'm clearly not very good.
At them i will say though okay in the.
End the finish was all kind of slop.
