Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel i.
Feel like it has been literally as so.
Long since i've lost in you guys i am so.
Sorry for the lack of videos that have.
Been coming out i've been so incredibly.
Busy with a lot of stuff of my personal.
Life but we're back we're ready to go.
It has also been a long time since i've.
Worn a black leather baseball hat in the.
Video but you know what this is what.
We're dealing with today.
You're welcome for the hat first today's.
Video i actually have a super fun at.
Challenge playing that i've never tried.
Before and i'm honestly absolutely.
Horrified to test out but you know what.
It's probably gonna be really funny for.
You guys to watch fun thing that is.
Super super vital to both beauty videos.
And just makeup in general is light when.
You guys watch my videos at home you get.
To watch a very very nice and beautiful.
Pretty setup but i shoot with two huge.
Huge huge lights that are hanging right.
Above my head they're very very.
Expensive as well and they do a very.
Nice job of lighting this whole room and.
Making me look very very pretty so for.
Today's video what we're gonna do is.
Lose them and i'm gonna do my entire.
Face and makeup in the dark despite the.
Fact that i thought my videos the two.
Very very expensive lights i also film.
It with a very very expensive camera.
Which upon further research i learned.
Does not have a nighttime mode of course.
So to fix this problem i went to best.
Buy today and picked up this also very.
Very expensive camera that i'll probably.
Never use again that looks like it's.
From 1984 but apparently it has a really.
Good at night mission mode so fingers.
Crossed that this video goes well i.
Thought of this challenge earlier on.
Today i thought it would be such a funny.
Video to do i've never seen it done.
Before but i looked it up and apparently.
Buzz we did it a few years ago so credit.
To them do not attack me for stealing.
And their video idea and without further.
Ado if you like to see me doing makeup.
In complete darkness keep on watching.
Hello.
Music.
So here that would be absolute pitch.
Block i've turned every single laid-off.
In my apartment and closed all my.
Curtains all i can see is just like.
Basic shapes and outlines and i have a.
Mirror right here okay know how because.
I put it there and i'm looking in it and.
I can see absolutely nothing so this.
Should be really great so not only can i.
Not see what i'm doing but for once in.
My life today coincidentally i decided.
To be organized and put everything back.
In storage so i'm gonna pick up all my.
Makeup product support this video not.
Being able to see it what they are lord.
Please help me get to this without.
Another scandal let's go okay so first.
We need a primer so i know that my.
Skincare drawer is right here i think i.
Know this is to touch a water cream okay.
Next is foundation which is english.
Right here oh god.
Okay i know this is a makeup forever.
Sick but i have way too many shades of.
That that is what are you too risky of a.
Game to be playing today oh i know.
Exactly what that is.
That's cancelled okay i think this is.
Tuefel this way because i know the tf.
Logo is right on top and like engraved.
Letters but i have no idea what shade.
This is and i just bought four new.
Shades so this might go really bad.
Really fast.
Next is a concealer which i know is over.
This is definitely thar shape tape this.
Feels very empty wait that's a good.
Thing that means i use it right welcome.
To contour.
Definitely yeah so next set your blush.
Comes highlighter.
Why am i forgetting my makeup routine.
Discuss i'm in the dark okay that's.
Gonna be here okay this is the new.
Anasazi i'm really a highlighter i think.
I hope the next after hand later comes.
Brows which i think is right above my oh.
There's benefical brown eye shadow so.
Let's head back down to the pallet or no.
I want to do they get a worm tone kafka.
Crease i obviously do those a lot so i.
Think i know the technique behind that.
And i think that'll be relatively okay.
Leader try to replicate tonight i have.
No ideas or that or that.
This feels dirty really really dirty.
Okay this is definitely multi palette oh.
I think this might be the john help out.
Oh this is definitely the 39a this is.
Too big to be a regular palette hello so.
I'm gonna go ahead and pick this palette.
I know that this one is a 39a but i.
Actually don't have the shades like.
Memorized so i'm too scared of doing.
Something very ugly with that and i.
Think that this might be the john help.
Out so this one that looks like it'd be.
A good contender hopefully so next i.
Need an eyeliner which i know is right.
Above the eyebrow drawer so that would.
Be here.
I think yeah right here.
Oh what did i just do uh-oh i doesn't.
Want to attempt to do a full on it.
So i'm looking for a black liquid liner.
I have no idea how ever gonna find oh.
Just kidding this is the kat von d.
Tattoo liner thing though oh what is all.
These drawers not closing what is my eye.
Oh setting spray i definitely need ah oh.
Let's grab yes that's is lips oh god.
This to go really wrong let's call this.
One oh my god not sad i say and i'm.
Gonna start by priming my face that i.
Used in what i hope is my top shot water.
Cream moisturizer i really really love.
This and it is really really great.
That's low buddy feels so gross because.
I'm so it's taking addressed right now.
Like this is not what i want to be doing.
But this is either born this way or it.
Could also be luminous silk thank you.
Guys so i hate that foundation i'm gonna.
Do three pumps there it is on the back.
Of my hand.
Oh yup there's defecation there uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I think this is very similar to the no.
Mirror makeup challenge being that i.
Obviously cannot see what i'm doing.
Except for the fact that there is a.
Mirror right there i just still can't.
See myself definitely needs for me to.
Blend on the neck because if this is the.
Wrong foundation shade that's gonna be.
Our only saving grace that might.
Disguise it a little bit okay so next up.
Is going to be our concealer which no.
Definitely not concealer is right here.
Okay oh this is definitely shaved table.
Uh-huh i'd done the nose bridge bring it.
Em out same thing on the other side oh.
That's my eyeball the key to this house.
Definitely gonna be to blend blend blend.
Blend blend because clearly i cannot see.
Anything that's going on i know there's.
A mirror right there but i won't.
Then comes beautyblender dip it right in.
Oh gosh.
Music.
Next comes contour which i know i have.
My cup mundi oh shade light palette for.
But i need to find my contouring brush.
And i know that all my brushes are.
Organized from smallest so i have my.
Like detail brushes that i have letting.
Brushes that i have face brushes right.
Here so this been it's gonna be where.
I'm gonna want to choose this one from.
This might be actually this is a fan.
Brush no that should not even be in.
There imagine i put it on and there's.
Like blue eye shadow on it holy crap i'm.
Going to go right in on my cheek bone.
Which is right about here how do you.
Just oh how do you just sit there.
Whether you're annoying a scar and just.
Let it hunk like that for like an hour.
It's in just going and going and going.
Collect your car this has been a psi i.
Need to move now next we're gonna do.
Some highlighter quickly and we're gonna.
Use what i hope is the anasazi rocks are.
Easy new highlighter oh you see that.
Glow me either okay also gonna go put it.
Right above the brow bone like always.
Okay that should be good.
I'm gonna get my beauty blender again.
And dip it into oh shoot i'm gonna judge.
By the noise of all the snot and right.
Now is that i'm definitely hitting the.
Right place okay so now it is eyebrows.
Heavy time horrified for but let's do.
This i'm gonna start off in the front.
And bring it up towards the tail which i.
Think is over here.
I hope bring it out then back up i'm.
Scared now just lean up underneath my.
Eyebrows which i know i need my mac i.
Like to cover up for so i'm gonna put.
This on.
The back of my hand a little squirt and.
I also need a flattop concealer brush.
Which should be amazing try to find in.
This it says my eyebrow bone yeah oh my.
God my eyelids feel why this is gross.
Okay so next is the part that i'm.
Absolutely dreading and that i'm sure.
You're all upset for the eyeshadow like.
I said i have no idea what problems even.
As dangerous cross said it's a jocelyn.
Hill palette i have a strong inkling.
That it may be but i could be very very.
Wrong so if this is about that i think.
It is i do use this palette quite a lot.
So i think i have a pretty good idea of.
Where the colors are and i think that.
The third shade from the top is a light.
Transition shade wait is it the one.
Below it i can really cannot tell where.
My actual creases this is not good i.
Usually do one eye at a time but i don't.
Trust myself to remember the colors that.
I use and i also definitely did not.
Trust myself to be able to find the.
Brushes again in a few minutes so i.
Guess we're gonna do both eyes at the.
Same time oh god just keep blending just.
Keep blending blending blending oh love.
That sister voice crack here next gonna.
Grab another fluffy brush and try to.
Deepen up the this feels like an m4 33.
Okay well the right chalk i'm gonna.
Place this right on my outer area.
Music.
Imagine i think i'm doing like a warm.
Tone half cut crease and by the end of.
The video i turn the lights on and i.
Have a blue smokey eye on with my luck i.
Wouldn't even be surprised okay so now.
That we have the crease colors all in.
Place i'm gonna take the stila liquid.
Metals in whatever shade this is and i'm.
Going to carve out my crease aha oh i.
Think that was to go to crease cutting i.
Felt that one even in the dark you're.
Still gonna have our little fan.
Okay and next i'm just going to be.
Winged liner which is oh right here oh.
If this look turned out any sort of good.
By some miracle this is where this is.
Where we lose it sisters.
Oh hey that could be good i think this i.
Might be a lot easier this is always my.
Better eye for eyeliner oh i forgot to.
Fill it in no i'm gonna leave it at that.
Okay we're almost done.
Thank god it is getting so dark i'm.
Literally falling asleep while doing.
This next up we have lashes god let's.
Undo the pasta oh god i forgot about the.
Whole tweezer situation wait i have to.
Cut these two scissors in the dark.
Sounds like the worst idea ever in the.
Entire world though that's my finger.
Okay oh that does not feel right she's.
On there.
Music.
I think oh hello.
Okay i feel like that could be.
Relatively correct this whole area feels.
Very very sticky which is telling me.
That i probably got glue in an area that.
Should not contain glue and now i'm.
Concerned.
Okay now that lashes are all are we have.
Mascara and for this i think i picked.
Out my benefit roller lash if i am.
Correct so i'm going to oh god oh god.
I'm actually horrified of this between.
West carrot with lights on is literally.
Already scary enough and i'm somehow me.
Editing to do this in complete darkness.
You know what if i poked myself i'm.
Already pretty much blind at this point.
I might as well finish it off oh just.
Like that oh and last but certainly not.
Least we have lipstick which i think is.
An overlook of lipstick i really it.
Could not see or smell much but with a.
Little amount of nasal passageway i have.
Left oh nope this is shave tape we have.
Lipstick which i think is oprah yeah.
Definitely over a house that very like.
Cupcake e-type smell uh-huh uh-huh got a.
Over line just a little bit oh that was.
A lot a bit okay i think we're done.
Oh we have to set our face in place okay.
Okay i think i'm ready for the reveal.
I'm honestly horrified but let's her.
Night vision off one two three oh my god.
Oh that was a lot okay hello oh oh oh.
God i'm scared.
This is interesting it just at least.
Lets go back through it step by step we.
Started off with touch of water cream i.
Was right it frickin love this thing.
Then to phrase boils my foundation i was.
Right once again it warm nude this.
Happens to be my shade thank god next.
Was tart shaped tape this is in the.
Shade lightmedium laura mercier that.
Was correct looks like i forgot to wipe.
Off my bake apparently that is just fine.
And dandy not surprised we use candy.
Shade and light palette they'll be.
Pretty hard to freakin it miss this one.
In my palette or considering it is.
Broken and open and barely existing.
Anymore for highlighter we did grab the.
Anasazi i'm lazy highlighter it is.
Definitely looking blinding to say the.
Least really love this super flattering.
Placement of all over my cheek that i.
Went with today okay let me know why.
This eyebrow is low-key like kind of.
Good.
This sister over here she's struggling.
Let's be real but this one over here.
Like she's doing it okay so next is.
Eyeshadow and we did end up with the.
Johnson help allah thank god i was right.
I'm not i ended up picking okay yeah the.
Transition shade which is right here and.
Then this shade right here i think if i.
Remember correctly which is the shades.
That i wanted to go with definitely not.
The half cut crease that we were going.
For but doesn't look that bad next was.
Eyeliner which turned out and trusting.
To say the least she comes to a nice.
Little point definitely is a little bit.
Wonky in this region it definitely could.
Be a little bit sharper like ready to.
Cut somebody but you know why she's.
She's a struggle wang she's like.
Flopping in the wind she's like not like.
Airborne yet but like she's trying she's.
Like the chicken of the wagons lying on.
Her that was a horrible joke also loved.
That i completely forgot to do with.
Lower lashline eye shadow good job james.
I think the best result out of the.
Entire face though is the lips like.
Hello look at these they look so good i.
Thought at one point my lipstick slipped.
And i overland way too much but.
Apparently i overlay my lips a lot on a.
Regular makeup basis because these look.
Pretty good i'm proud of myself for that.
One not just for sure not gonna lie i.
Really did not have high hopes for this.
Challenge at all i think this is kind of.
Like the no mirror makeup challenge and.
That you can't see what you're doing at.
All but also i did not pick up the.
Makeup products prior either so picking.
All of these could have really easily.
Been a huge disaster but that just tells.
Me that i am way too addicted to makeup.
And know way too much about all the.
Products that i use on an everyday basis.
Because i feel like i did a very very.
Good job of picking out products that i.
Would normally use so i guess good job.
To myself for that i definitely want you.
Guys leave me a comment down below.
Though tell me how you think i did do.
You think you could do this challenge.
