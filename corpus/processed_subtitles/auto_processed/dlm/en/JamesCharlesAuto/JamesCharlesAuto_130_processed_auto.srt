I sisters james charles heard welcome.
Back to my youtube channel you guys.
Sister yet is rocking town after 2008 is.
Probably back in time for the summer.
It's been talking the james watts.
Apartment together.
And since we're currently on a little.
Hiatus from brother and sister i.
Definitely want to smell something at.
The end because i know you guys have all.
Miss him a lot.
Yesterday i anybody in front of and i.
Walked into my closet and i didn't know.
What i wanted to wear and he was helping.
Me go through things and he was.
Critiquing a lot of my wardrobe and he.
Had definitely has a huge interest in.
Fashion but a little bit different than.
Your interest a little bit different.
Yeah but he definitely does like fashion.
A lot ian's outfits and my opinion are.
Scary it's the same thing yes you never.
Text season certain pictures before.
Posting but every time he does i always.
Look at them and i'm like wow that is.
Literally the worst since you clearly.
Have very different fashion senses i.
Thought it would be such a fun video to.
Do it in and i tried to buy each other.
I'll bet like james did say we.
Definitely do have different styles of.
Clothing they like to wear but growing.
Up together i feel like we both have a.
Good sense of what we like so i thought.
This challenge might be easy okay i.
Think every time i see you were in a.
Very very new style you change that your.
Interest and clothes a lot.
Whereas i'm feeling - i'm pretty similar.
For the past few years so i think of.
Anything you might have this easier than.
Me say you like to wear like $1,000.
Black sweatshirts because they say so.
Basically to do this job today we're all.
Gonna head over to the mall and i'm.
Gonna shop with my best friend drew and.
He's gonna take my videographer kelly.
And we're going to sister shop for each.
Other in secret and we're going to avoid.
All cost not show each other what we're.
Getting and we have to put together a.
Full-on look so head to toe whatever it.
Takes to put together like a full.
Instagram ready.
Look oh good question.
Okay i feel like we actually maybe.
Should do no budget for this let's just.
Do no price range i am scared of that i.
Won't talk to you define you am buying.
You an outfit well yeah but i could ugly.
One.
Gonna do that turn it well yeah i guess.
You got me there.
Okay i guess we'll do no price range but.
Please don't go crazy on my credit card.
I got you.
Do you yeah okay all right i guess um.
This is yours.
Thanks book let's go sister shopping all.
Right guys we just got to the mall and.
I'm ready to pick out sister anne's.
Outfits i definitely have a lot of work.
To do today his style is very much bad.
So i definitely get a little like kind.
Of just good cohesive luck and i know.
He's had a toga that he wants a ring so.
I'm gonna try to be a good older sister.
And gave him a cue train to make him.
Super super happy hopefully he'll love.
The outfit that we come up all right.
Guys right now we're in nordstrom i'm.
Hopefully gonna find james a full outfit.
So pants shirt or sweatshirt shoes.
Accessories everything.
Lots of good and fresh brought the.
T-shirts that are probably for a white.
Sweatshirt shopping for yourself about.
To be buried this is a tricycle i think.
I need this right now.
Okay i'll be purchasing this for myself.
Sorry yeah.
What doesn't have true looking the woman.
Who not seen anything over it i'm gonna.
Try okay i designed this jacket from.
Champion wears a lot of champion and he.
Also wears a lot of chocolates like that.
This could be a really good in fresh.
Piece for him oh you know what it makes.
A plenty i'll go with the puma that's.
What i'm saying.
They're also 770.
There's something different $345 all.
Right we got these are 700 janesville is.
Adsense you can afford these pretty.
Easily so these might be enough all.
Right so in order to really find.
Anything besides the shoes everything.
Was connell christ those buff never leaf.
In james's style let me put the.
Valentino's on hold but i'm kind of.
Scared to spend 700 but we're gonna keep.
On looking really like dragon boom pans.
And that's the only straight boys that i.
Really know with my life so that could.
Be a good option for you this is.
Definitely james book $350 there's no.
Matching pants might not be a good idea.
Once again was wearing tonight.
And they monster champion chocolate.
We need these this jacket says james.
It's only five ninety so those adsense.
Bam.
Easy it's black so it's gonna match it.
Anything nonprofit shirt for one look i.
Need to just get him like a q relatively.
Simple plain shirt that doesn't have.
Alright so we decided to get the.
46 instant change.
After tax hopefully it's gonna like it.
It's gonna match everything so let's.
Keep on jeans are you excited about your.
Sister purchases i really a look a big.
Brown bag okay guys we successfully.
Bought a pair of shoes in a jogger pan.
And a jogger for me.
Our total came to at three hundred and.
Twenty six dollars this is proving to be.
Very expensive very quickly and we only.
Have two items down south.
Thrust.
Irenna scribes the whole valentino shoes.
I think we're gonna go with these.
Because it changes the true indeed a.
Sister adidas sponsor there we go this.
Is the hot arrest on slightly low by.
Right yeah.
Waiting to knocking on that that is.
Awfully short of everything it was her.
Away i really like the shirt business.
Blind they are to get really cute.
Conventionally while achaeans outfit but.
He is notorious for wearing oversized.
Shirts and he's already very tall and.
Skinny so i don't want to make any more.
Of a string bean than he already is and.
This shirt is very long so i'm gonna.
Hold this contender but his pants are.
Usually like just straight fit kits that.
Are cropped way to hide those ankles.
Look weird what my biggest have to do is.
With the alpha jump a couple be honest.
So this one needs like charcoal jeans.
That i think it actually really good and.
They're definitely not something that he.
Has so we're actually done at getting.
Has entire outfit so that's really great.
Work really professional shopper is but.
Since manager are done so earlier we're.
Gonna go get some ice cream.
A sister snack while again the finished.
Stop because he sucks.
There were definitely a look at some.
Kappas folks i know james is a couple.
Items already so we're gonna find.
Something he doesn't already back to.
Louisville the shoes and pants and.
Jackets oh my goodness yes those.
Shopping so i decided to peace out for a.
Few minutes and take a little bit of a.
Detour to get ian a little sister.
Surprise so we just got double dose we.
Got some dior glasses and a cap a.
T-shirt james andrew said they were done.
With their whole outfit but they said.
That we back in 30 minutes so i'm quite.
Curious to see where they are all 16 9nk.
Courtesan three-quarter 63 but a little.
Brother's definitely more of a man.
Music.
I could impress 3,000 to have a.
Particular tree just do it yeah it's.
Kind of fun we could be twinning sister.
Sibling it's for real.
That's all i'm paying you today as a man.
I love that when you're that far right.
To get a free cookie 11 large over here.
Okay good actually it better be good for.
4,000 it's kind of worth that i'm scared.
Oh i'll be a to go first i'll show.
You yours first you think yeah are you.
Confident that let's do it all right so.
Weird you like bottom oh quick shoes at.
Their time i guess bottoms up.
Wait is that the lyrics or the bottles.
Music.
Tea.
Oh really love those okay funny the.
Boffin.
15th pair of adidas joggers okay it sure.
Do need to always more can't go wrong.
With a brand new perfectly let's compare.
Answer the hardest part really love a.
Good cup of sir.
These are good so far i told you okay.
Wow that's really gonna prize next to i.
Don't so like though.
Oh this is god.
It's the brewery talkin sister i told.
You i will cost about it why don't you.
Actually love this yeah this is the.
Masterpiece yen you're literally kidding.
Me me and drew walked by these in the.
Store and we're like we need those right.
Now we did you the best.
I told you this oh my god did i go off.
Or did i not go you kind of went off not.
Gonna lie how much did you spend until.
It all you thought was the glasses were.
700 something dude i ready to see yours.
I'm kind of scared i think this'll be.
Good i don't like that you off the.
Weirdest clothing taste ever well first.
I got this adidas jacket which is mine.
Let me know over there okay.
First awkward okay i want you to know.
That i put together this fall cohesive.
Outfit too so everything will match no.
It's not like god not just this thing.
Okay i think they're pretty civil side.
Of the shirt you have on now they match.
It okay i think they're pretty cute do.
You like everything gray right and below.
So you can watch as the most outfits.
Yes okay do you like that yeah really.
Yeah i feel like when i was in your.
Pieces i really want to make sure a lot.
Of the things like went together because.
They like one of the main issues you.
Have with your office is that they never.
Match there's always like a few really.
Good elements with and there's always.
Like that one thing that you add that's.
Ever like not me you just have no you.
Just have questionable taste okay ready.
I have no idea what pants you got for.
Those shoes now matt you're really.
Scared why only a very few amount of.
Pair of pants that that's not true we.
Actually don't really think about oh i.
Don't really think all these pants.
Watching my shoes.
Well the rest go together really nicely.
We'll be fine okay okay good i got you a.
Good pair of dark skinny because they're.
Not fully blocked because they like you.
Have a lot of black pants already and.
They're like a nice wash and i also.
Think you don't really have that when.
You purchase skinny jeans my most a lot.
Of pants that you wear are kind of.
Straight fit and you cut them at the.
Ankle and it doesn't look good okay wow.
Two for two so far nevers are gonna move.
In with the shoes though yeah yeah i.
Will admit i don't really think about.
That together but i think we should be.
Fine next item is your certain rue de.
Mexican dude this shirt i've ever really.
Cute i feel like you have a lot of like.
Graphic tees so introducing that was.
Like simple but i had like some sort of.
Element to it so it like you would.
Actually watch we're cool i think it.
It's a little bit long the way i have to.
Crop it depending on looks with the.
Outfit i don't like not crop but like.
Just like cut like two inches off like a.
Crop top.
Although that is a good approach to you.
Pick a lot of items that make you look.
Like a string bean like you're already.
Very tall and lanky and you wear shirts.
That are like eight inches too long and.
Pans that are straight and no jacket and.
Like long shoes so you just look like.
You're like 87 feet tall about your.
Knots we need to break it to you ready i.
Guess lastly we have this last one.
Now uses last okay we found this one.
First and i actually think you're really.
Gonna like this one.
Oh god i almost want another one for.
Myself i think you'll look so good or.
Not it's a large so it still gives you.
Like that oversized shape with a bigger.
T-shirt and then we got either really.
Skinny jeans are kind of like taper of.
The body give you a little sister shape.
Instead of being a sister shrimpy yeah.
I'm excited if you go put them on what.
Pull them up more they're skinny jeans.
Well you're saying those four to twelve.
Ey those are a medium i can spend an.
Extra sister in here it's kind of as a.
Good lock okay they really are a little.
Big role that's how you do that's what.
You do when your pants are too big dude.
Oh it's too bad you can't see it hello.
Host the gay is tell it's a hundred.
Degrees my program you just gave me a.
Winter jacket you gave me a winter.
Jacket as well you be kind of killed.
That how do you like your like pants.
I'm not used to pants like that.
Everything you guys sister shucks the.
Mouth i'm just not used to skinny jeans.
I actually really love on this look.
Looks on you i think even though that.
Seems a little bit uncomfortable they do.
Look really good it definitely did.
Exactly what i wanted it to do of giving.
You kind of like the larger oversized.
Pores on the top but the skinnier.
Portions on the bottom so everything.
Looks a lot more cohesive and not as.
Strangely like i do have one last thing.
To add to this outfit.
Oh god what did you do.
I'm so scared probably made our building.
Bad impulsive perez i just wanted to.
Really completely off bad give it a full.
Sister james look it's beautiful.
Wow lucky here all come wait yo how much.
Did this cost the fall outfit yeah for.
$1,750 okay pretty fun though right you.

Means we literally spent over six.
Thousand dollars on this challenge today.
That no budget thing really made it no.
Challenge.
Music.
All right it's like as that completes.
His sister shopping spree in this video.
Today i actually had so much fun doing.
This not gonna lie i was a little bit.
Worried in the beginning because like i.
Said again cell is ever-changing but i.
Was very much looking forward to putting.
You in something much cuter than the.
Average sister you've helped and i am.
Very proud of how this turned out and.
I'm glad you like it.
I think james's style is very hard to.
Find in store is actually really true.
Finding clothes that you would just buy.
