Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back 22 panel as you guys know.
Halloween is right around the corner i'm.
Posting this on a tuesday and i think.
Halloween is on thursday this year so.
Pretty soon i am very very excited you.
Guys know this is literally my all-time.
Favorite time of the year i love love.
Love spooky season i don't know that so.
Many of you guys do as well so today i.
Am back with another halloween themed.
Video and for today we're going to doing.
With my favorite things in the entire.
World a drag transformation now.
Personally a drag has influenced me it's.
So so so much growing up i obviously.
Have transformed a few times i bought my.
Youtube channel out of my instagram into.
A drag me but i've never actually got.
Any real chance to perform or probably.
For the better you guys are all covered.
That but also i've learned so did for.
Makeup techniques from drag queens and.
It pretty much my entire vocabulary at.
This point is from rupaul's drag race my.
Favorite show in the entire world so i.
Love drag i have so much respect for and.
Also halloween is kind of like the.
Birthday of so many drag queens it is an.
Amazing time to obviously express.
Yourself i'll play with makeup and go in.
Costumes and this end of the year is a.
Lot of times that drag queens realize.
That they have a true love for.
Performing and makeup artistry so for.
Today's video i thought it'd be so much.
Fun to sit down do a drag transformation.
I have not done one in quite a long time.
And obviously you guys know we just.
Released the morphe x change cause mini.
Palette so we're gonna go from this to.
This if you guys want to see how i.
Created this look from head to toe keep.
On watching.
Music.
How are you guys let's jump right into.
This because it's going to be quite the.
Long video today and i'm gonna try to go.
In-depth as possible so our first step.
Is always going to be to glue down our.
Eyebrows obviously i'm very very manly.
Square eyebrows that i want to lift them.
Up make them snatched for the gods and.
We need to cover them in order to do so.
I normally put moisturizer on my face.
First but i not put anything on today so.
It's completely dry which means people.
Will be able to stick to it and i'm just.
Gonna grab a normal elmer's washable.
Glue stick make sure it is the purple.
One that tries it clear just like this.
And i'm going to just go right into the.
Brow now for this first layer i.
Definitely like to be a very very messy.
With my glue application because we are.
Going to clean it up after and we really.
Wanna make sure every single hair is.
Extremely extremely coated and there is.
A thick with two fees layer on the brow.
Notice i'm going against the grain of.
The hair as well now i'm just gonna grab.
Any old angle brush my brush collection.
And i'm going to push very very hard.
Into my forehead and brush all the hairs.
Upwards in the direction that they grow.
In it so we are flattening it to the.
Face and now with that glue again i'm.
Going to press that right down and i.
Just covering it white white before that.
Glue dries i'm going to take this and.
I'm going to go around the edge of the.
Glue and just wipe off any excess just.
Because the glue does get kind of.
Textured on the edges if you're not.
Super careful and we want this to look.
As smooth as possible.
I think that's all cleaned up i'm just.
Gonna grab my hairdryer on my face this.
Is the necessary by the way i'm just.
Extremely impatient so this really helps.
Gonna add a second layer of glue at this.
Time just going in the direction of the.
Hairs try it again more glue or clean up.
Or blow drying and then one final layer.
Just for safety.
Another eyebrows pretty much all glued.
Down if you touch is to be completely.
Dry and flat to your face you should.
Feel no texture whatsoever it is very.
Weird and strange feeling and it looks.
Strange but it's about to be completely.
Covered now i used to use a translucent.
Powder as the next step but i recently.
Learned otherwise.
So instead i'm going to grab a.
Foundation powder this one happens to be.
The makeup forever i don't even know i.
Just found this in my set and it's kind.
Of a powder puff and i'm going to use.
This to cover over this brow first you.
Can use the translucent powder here and.
Set it just like i did for a very very.
Long time but by setting with a.
Foundation powder first you're basically.
Just adding one more layer of coverage.
Which why not now i'm gonna grab some of.
The dragon beauty color correcting a.
Skin fire something at makita nobody has.
Time for these names okay and i'm going.
To use it this orange color corrector.
And paint this over top of the brow.
Because my brow hairs are dark brown.
Which have a blue undertone and orange.
Color corrects blue so this will help.
Make it disappear even more well right.
I'm also going to color correct my five.
O'clock shadow region because this area.
Is also gray because believe it or not i.
Am a man but it's going to very gently.
Tap out to this color corrector.
So this is pretty much one brow i'll.
Complete while this one is drying i'm.
Gonna do the other one off camera and.
I'll be right back.
Alright you guys said that the brows are.
All covered it is time for foundation.
And brows now donations pretty easy but.
The brows are by far the hardest part of.
Dog makeup and it seems like they'd be.
So simple but if you put them in the.
Wrong place or if they're not even after.
We're in the wrong direction it's game.
What we're supposed to be super super.
Careful.
Today i'm first gonna have my kryolan.
That tv a paint stick and the shade and.
Be honestly this color doesn't even.
Notch me at that well if foundation.
Stick is just so incredibly pigmented.
Though so i'm going to use this to cover.
Over up my brows and then i'm going to.
Use another foundation that later on for.
The rest of my face so i'm just going to.
Place on here mine's also ridiculously.
Dry for some stupid reason so instead of.
Scrubbing this over the top of my brow i.
Don't want to disrupt anything i'm just.
Going to top this on like an idiot that.
Is the obstacles carrying state every.
Single time i'm gonna use this to go.
Over my beard region as well now we're.
Just going to blend.
Oh and that's i'm just using a attends.
Foundation brushes at the morphe adam up.
For 395 some yuko james for generous.
Enough and it's also in the james.
Charles original brush that i normally.
Use a beauty blender for foundation and.
I definitely will in a few minutes but.
When it comes to it this particular.
Foundation or just kind of any stick.
Foundations and don't know i like to do.
Any general half they brushed first just.
To really like scrub it in there okay so.
Now while the solution is still wet i'm.
Gonna grab an angled powder and just.
Like any brown cream and this happens to.
Be a contour stick and i'm gonna use.
This to start sketching out the brows.
Now you guys know beforehand i used to.
Say everything first and then just draw.
Out the browser powder and then conceal.
Them after but doing it beforehand is so.
Much better because if you put it in the.
Wrong place you can easily fix the.
Foundation while it's still wet and it.
Won't get very very messy so i much.
Prefer doing it this way and i'm just.
Gonna pull this tail straight outwards i.
Feel like the one mistake that really.
Gets people all the time when it comes.
To it drag brows is just putting them.
Too high unless you're doing a paint.
Like check see mattel or kimchi where.
You're literally trying to give yourself.
A new phase which i'm all here for it's.
Good to start your broth on the same.
Place that it normally does and just.
Lift it higher because that's gonna give.
It that more feminine type of effect.
Rather than like a weird character.
Character alright that is a really good.
Base i'm gonna do the same thing on the.
Other side now try to make them even as.
You can now that we have the general.
Shape i'm gonna grab the tv paint stick.
In 0-0 this is just the white one.
Actually i think it's technically.
Off-white and just a flat concealer.
Brush this is the m4 ten and i'm going.
To clean up the bottom of the brow and.
Give us that shape alright so this is.
Why doing your eyebrows a first is so.
Much better because i've literally been.
Doing my brows now for 45 minutes and i.
Still am really not happy with the way.
They're looking i cannot get them even.
But this will do because we can always.
Fix them a little bit later on i'm just.
Gonna move on i'm next gonna grab my tv.
Foundation stick once again in white and.
I'm going to use this and put this right.
Here in the center of my face down here.
For highlights and the sides my nose on.
The chin and then just right here no.
It's kind of on that end i'm just.
Letting this white into my skin it just.
Like my normal beauty routine as if it.
Were a concealer this is going to really.
Help bring attention to the center.
Points of our face but that same clothes.
That i used to draw in my brows i'm just.
Going to sketch in mine.
Contours and i'm just going to blend.
This out using a fluffy brush last step.
Before we get to set this face in place.
I'm gonna grab my nose country marks the.
E62 which is available and.
The original in mini james charles brush.
Sets i'm going to use this to sketch up.
My nose contour and make myself super.
Super pinched finally 18 million years.
Later we're done with our face now you.
Get to set it in place and then.
Basically redo it again with more powder.
So this should be fairly fine up but now.
It's pretty much smooth sailing from.
Here on i like to think that only god.
But also jesus on this fine day.
I'm gonna go to the rcm a no color.
Powder and basically just tap the sauce.
On my bench grab the powder puff and.
Start packing this in now it's time to.
Bring some color back that we literally.
Just covered up using this powder this.
Is where the drying process takes so.
Many hours but it's so worth it in the.
End i'm gonna grab my dragon a beauty at.
Face palette and i'm gonna start just.
Recontouring up my face first using the.
Shade at femme and i am for oh i brush.
Just following literally the same exact.
Shape that i had made beforehand.
Actually gonna go and have a 5 to 7.
Instead i don't have time for this gonna.
Grab a little bit of serge and uses to.
Really hollow out the lower portion of.
The cheekbone up being very very gentle.
Without shaking because it is extremely.
Pigmented now for blush let's put i have.
An 8 for brush and into the shade be be.
A girl in the face pact and use this.
Color video my face a quick spreads of.
Some settings right is because there's.
Like 18,000 layers of powder at this.
Point.
Alright so i'm gonna grab an angled.
Brush at once again and dipping into at.
The dark brown shade in the top right.
Corner of the palette which is an t i'm.
Gonna use this to start filling in.
Details my brows and then same thing on.
The other side next to the govern anna.
508 which also comes in the mini brush.
That i'm gonna grab the shade punched me.
Which is the kind of neutral tone and.
Brown shade in the palette and i'm going.
To use this color to blend out the t.
Inward because joey it looks actually.
Really good on camera mommy.
Mom leave us alone here charlotte oh.
Or just three women obvious did not.
Stand for the isetta portion where we.
Get to actually have a fun of course i'm.
Using the at james house explore the.
Mini palette available on murphy calm.
And a tall murphy stores use co james.
For 10% off only $23 and also in all.
Ulta beauty locations also i'm just.
Going to doing a simple rainbow look you.
Guys have seen me do these paper looks a.
Lot of times before but it is a rainbow.
Trog a concept it'll make sense later on.
So we're kind of kind of like brushed.
Through this it's just real overall the.
Concepts and shapes i'm gonna first grab.
Be in the bright yellow shade and put it.
Right in my little inner region we're.
Just gonna start blending it upwards in.
A circular shape but i'm gonna have an m.
For 33 and dip into five one eight and.
I'm going to blend that right next to be.
A little bit of a rusted adjust to add.
Some dimension in there i'm modeling my.
Makeup by the way off of raven at.
Legendary dark cream from season two it.
Should have been the winner but we're.
Not gonna talk about that today she is.
Like by far the most iconic makeup.
Legend ever and i'm trying to follow.
Like her general i she with a little.
Pencil brush i'm just going to grab a.
Little bit about 10% off and use this to.
Shade the very bottom part of this.
Orange like i said we are going to cut.
This so you won't even see this in a few.
Seconds but just add a little bit of a.
Dimension i'm next gonna grab another.
Fluffier brush that i'm four three three.
And dip into it skip the bright pink.
Shade and i'm going to use this and i'm.
Going to blend this pink right in here.
I'm going to pull this color downward.
But just saying that i normally don't do.
But i'm gonna kind of actually close off.
This eye shape a little bit now with an.
Outlet 506 i'm gonna dip into a little.
Bit love that i'm gonna use that to.
Shade at the bottom portion shade of.
This now is just a white liner and some.
Concealer brush i'm going to carve out.
My crease starting off in this inner.
Corner okay then i'm gonna set this.
Liner in place using some more up.
Flashback.
Now i'm gonna sketch in my winged liner.
This is actually going in a good.
Direction.
I am happy i'm gonna use anasazi a black.
Liquid liner just to catch out a nice.
Juicy wing okay so basically i'm gonna.
Do this with my eye open which is not.
Really how you're supposed to do with.
Liner ever but i want the winged liner.
To be above my actual eye lid so.
Therefore basically my entire eyelid.
It's gonna be black and then it'll look.
Like a normal wing with my eyes open.
That made sense right now that that.
Liner join i'm just gonna grab a little.
Bit of a spooky from the palette top off.
The access and.
Make sure that that black eyeliner is.
Set in place and very very blocked.
Because we don't want it to transfer.
Anywhere on the lower lash line we are.
First going to grab a little bit more of.
That white liner and i'm using just a.
Flat brush and i'm going to fill in my.
Waterline i'm basically just imagining.
That there's a straight line like if i.
Look forward from like the corner of my.
Eye ball just like outwards so i'm gonna.
Throw all that end with white and this.
Is definitely gonna take me looking.
Closely in the mirror because this is it.
An illusion since my face is not.
Straight across my mini palette mirror.
Lois it's great for glamming on the go.
Now with another emma five-foot-eight.
Brush i'm going to draw a little bit of.
Cola first and then i'm gonna put coal.
Up right in the middle of my lash line.
Right up against the actual.
Lash line and then like i said i'm.
Agitating there's a straight line at so.
I'm pulling that forward just like this.
Okay then with that same exact brush.
Down finally i'm gonna grab a little bit.
Of a single and escape and i'm just.
Going to pull this purple color out just.
Like this so see how that creates out.
Like a straight line shape that's what.
We want and then with that same brush.
Again just covering a little bit of.
Social blade and a completing dot line.
In the front now i'm just blending out.
The line with a fluffier brush this one.
Is the e30 is six a little bit of a.
Playground okay you guys i have done.
Drive makeup literally so many turns out.
And is not even funny and i've been.
Trying to emulate ravens like aura and.
Just shapes of makeup since i literally.
Started doing it in fact my first choice.
Look ever three years ago was a raven.
Luck it was the worst i makeup i've ever.
Done in my entire life.
But i think this is the first thing that.
I've ever actually successfully gotten.
At the shape.
I feel like this looks so bomb i am so.
Excited right now.
And it wasn't that hard either but what.
Made me hard is getting even on the.
Other side at which i'm gonna go do off.
Camera right now and then i'll be right.
Back.
To pop on the wash and finish up the.
Rest of the look we're back the bolt.
Eyes are now complete and somehow very.
Symmetrical it is a blast day here the.
Sister studio and i'm about to apply.
Some lash as a person was gonna play a.
Late coat of mascara today i'm gonna use.
The lily lashes of triple x mascara.
Because it has been up my favorite.
Recently okay and then i'm gonna.
Carefully also apply out some mascara on.
My lower lashes but i'm going to skip.
Out on the lashes.
My inner corners and also losses on my.
Outer corners because i want those to.
Remain in a white to keep that lytic.
Spatial illusion going for lashes i'm.
Just gonna pop on a typical 301 that.
Drag lash but for once i'm not gonna.
Stack it i just want to do it one lash.
I'm not sure why this is like brave of.
Me to even attempt this bats be good.
Alright you guys so those are both of.
The eyes all complete and it is now the.
Home strats are gonna move on to the.
Rest of the face and the next step we.
Have is going to be of course.
Highlighting so i'm moving my face a.
Nice spritz of the more people have been.
Set setting spray to sprint's them at.
Moisture about and i'm gonna grab hey.
04 under a little bit of a face.
From the palette maybe a little bit of.
Ring light to honestly why not i just.
Put this right on the cheekbone a little.
Bit on the forehead for a little bit of.
An extra blow that some right down the.
Tip of the nose next under grab a little.
Bit of literally it which is my a peachy.
Blush shade from the palette i'm gonna.
Use this to blend together my highlight.
And my blush now i'm going to clean up.
My lips and oh my god we're like.
Cruising along thank god and we're gonna.
Fill in a nude lip like always.
Music.
Okay you guys this look is pretty much.
About complete at this point i'm going.
To give these a nice sprint of the urban.
Decay all nighter setting spray to lock.
Everything in and then the mini palette.
Also serves as a fan because i cannot.
Find my sister's been anywhere so all.

Looks than i have ever ever done a shout.
Out to my stylist joey tao for selling.

Tricks i'm running so late for my.
Halloween party right now so i really.
Gotta go but thank you guys so much for.
Watching hello you guys a good morning i.
Look like hit by a bus currently we did.
Not be at home last night and talking.
00 in the morning halloween it's.
Like the one time of the year that i.
Will actually go out and party and it.
Was lit not gonna lie.
Just watching back the footage from.
Filming last night and i still a home.
Look turned out but i was running an.
Hour and a half late for my party and i.
Realized that i did not really explain.
My look what i know if the mini palette.
Pretty much every drag queen friend that.
I've ever met texted me so that they.
Needed it immediately because it would.
Make getting ready in the backstage area.
So much easier that is why the dress is.
Black in both the dress and the wig are.
Splutter painted with different colors.
From the palette and that is why the top.
Of the bodice is made completely out of.
Broken shards of mirror and honor of the.
Palette not having a mirror at first.
Glance i'm not realizing it may not be.
At that obvious but i'm really proud of.
Have the look turned out and i'm really.
Grateful to the designers who work super.
Hard i think it looked so beautiful so.
