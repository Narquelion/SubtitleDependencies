Hi guys james charles here and welcome.
Back to my youtube channel this past.
Weekend i went to generation beauty and.
Los angeles and i got to see everybody.
And i got to meet so many of you guys.
Which was so much fun for today's look i.
Decided to do this monochromatic pink.
Glowing glam i love this look this is.
What i were to generation beauty at this.
Past weekend and so many of you guys are.
Asking questions about so i figured i.
Would sit down and do tutorial like i.
Said in my last video i have not done.
Any creative look in a long time and.
Let's be real one colors and the most.
Creative thing in the world but at least.
It's not everyday wearable glam trust me.
We'll be getting into more conceptual.
Crazy look soon especially with.
Coachella coming up but for now if you.
Guys want to see how i created this look.
Make sure you would keep on watching i'm.
First gonna start off by priming my face.
As always with my benefit porefessional.
Primer nothing new just sloppiness on.
Over to get a nice and smooth base her.
Foundation today i'm actually gonna be.
Trying a new combination i am very very.
Excited for this one of my friends.
Recommended this combo to me and he.
Always looks so freaking bomb with the.
Most beautiful flawless skin so i just.
Went to support earlier on tonight and.
Everything up and we're gonna do a.
Little bit of mixing i'm gonna use my.
Giorgio armani a luminous sub foundation.
In the shade 3.5 this is way too dark.
For me so i'm gonna be mixing it with.
The urban decay naked skin in the shade.
2.5 and then the bare minerals.
Complexion rescue in opal which is the.
Lightest shade so hopefully that'll like.
Even everything out i guess well this is.
Very liquidy yeah oh wow oh this looks.
Gross until apply this today i will be.
Using my morphe 48 brush ok i'm.
Switching to a beauty blender i just.
Could not do the whole brush situation.
Alright i'm not too sure how i feel.
About this just yet this is the first.
Time i've ever mixed foundations.
I like the coverage is giving me it's.
Like a nice natural coverage not sure if.
I'd like the texture but then again my.
Face is already really textured to begin.
So i'm not really sure if it's just me.
Like imagining worst texture or like if.
There's i don't know well i'm just gonna.
Keep going and see what it feels like.
Later on we're gonna see though i'm.
Gonna use of course my fav the.
Heart-shaped tape i use a lot less.
Concealer than normal today i want my.
Skin to look like really natural and.
Like really do.
And chloe with this look not as like.
Cakey like my normal everyday makeup.
Alright so overall actually really.
Liking how this is looking i didn't pre.
Oh sometimes take it back and then i'm.
Gonna stand under my eyes by laura.
Mercier secret under-eye brightening.
Powder well that's a mouthful.
The foundation is separating a little.
Bit in the nose region but i mean are we.
Really surprised that gets jim charles.
Knows i have to pre prime like 15 layers.
Anyway to begin with so this is no.
Shocker i'm gonna really lightly dust.
Away the laura mercier powder oh that i.
Don't like oh you just took a turn for.
The worst.
Am i seeing things i feel like i'm just.
So used to my makeup forever stick at.
This point that anything else is just.
Gonna look so strange to me i'm probably.
Just over exaggerating like i said i'm.
Just gonna keep going we'll figure it.
Out later.
Gibran's today i'm using the middle.
Shade of the kat von d shade lamp out of.
My morphe m 435 i did just buy a new.
Palette at sephora earlier on today but.
I'm gonna get all the way out of this.
One that i possibly can i feel like this.
Secret under-eye brightening powder may.
Have secretly brightened up my under-eye.
A little bit too much laura mercier girl.
I trust that you and since the.
Foundation on my nose is separating a.
Little bit i'm going to lightly and i.
Mean super super lightly try to contour.
My nose using my own 4-3-3 this is just.
A normal blending brush a lot of you.
Guys asked to and what i do my nose.
Contour i always like to bring that.
Shadow just the tiniest bit into my brow.
Bone region it always looks kind of.
Strange if you have like a really.
Pinched nose contour going like all the.
Way up the bridge and then also just.
Like stops here so i always like to.
Blend it just a little bit open to like.
The socket brow region just to kind of.
Make everything continuous and flow and.
Look as natural as we can get to start.
Off my brows i'm gonna be using my.
Benefit precisely my brow pencil in the.
Shade number 5 for this particular look.
I'm keeping my brows super fluffy and.
Almost like natural i want them to be.
Very very like editorial but she push.
Top so i'm doing them the same way i did.
In my last video the everyday makeup.
Routine just sketching in hairs and then.
Brushing upwards to blend them out i'm.
Gonna super lightly conceal and clean up.
That browsing my e43 and its shape tape.
Concealer and then just the tiniest bit.
Of benefit gimme brow to brush the hairs.
Upwards and keep them in place.
Okay wow for once i'm actually loving.
How this bra is turning out maybe today.
Will be a good makeup day unlike the.
Last video i said very very similar to.
My everyday makeup routine bras just.
Light fluffy and natural sort of to.
Prime my lids for shadow i'm just gonna.
Use a little bit more of that shape tape.
Concealer and then just setting those.
Lives in place using my at a 45 for more.
P and my yet cody ayersman powder come.
On guys you know me how to fit it in.
There somewhere for eyeshadow today i'm.
Gonna start off with my m4 for one from.
Morphe and the makeup geek single shadow.
In the shade ben i'm really lightly.
Placing this in the crease and on the.
Lid just making a kind of really blown.
Out pinky a cool toned red smokey eye.
Only go to use me i think like probably.
One or two shadows for this entire color.
And you could totally switch this up to.
Be any color that your heart desires i.
Just chose to do pink today grabbing.
That same exact shadow on an m4 33 i'm.
Going to deepen up the lid and just.
Blend that into the crease and i'm also.
Using that brush in the same shape to.
Begin of shading my lower lash line for.
The later i'm gonna spreads my ab 705.
With a little bit of urban decay all.
Nighter setting spray and then i'm going.
To use the untamed pressed pigment oh.
Wow that is so pretty and then going.
Back into my m4 33 to blend out the.
Edges okay i just did the other eye off.
Camera so we can save some time and not.
Be sitting here for a million years now.
Normally next i would do lashes but i'm.
Gonna kind of skip around and change up.
The order a little bit for this.
Particular look taking miami 5 on i'm.
Gonna dip into a little bit more of that.
Bit in a shadow i'm actually gonna be.
Using this eyeshadow for blush and it's.
Just a powder so it'll totally work and.
I would normally use a blush but i don't.
Really have anything that'll match is.
The exact color and i want this entire.
Thing to be monochromatic and really.
Really cohesive i'm gonna super lightly.
Dust this color over my cheekbones where.
I would normally put my blush and my.
Highlighter as well so the two will mix.
Together next i'm gonna go to this.
Highlighter from a star crush minerals.
In the shade.
Rosy future these products are so bob.
And i don't think i've talked about them.
On my channel before i used to have a.
Code and expired but now it's back so i.
Wanted to feature this today if you use.
Code james on the ropes that you get 50%.
Off all products this video is not.
Sponsored i promise i just love.
Featuring brands that i love and support.
Especially the ones that are cheap.
Because i know.
Expensive makeup can be these guys are.
Four frickin dollars with the code and.
I'm pretty sure they're single shadows.
Or like a dollar and fifty cents it's a.
Really good deal for really great.
Products and if you haven't checked them.
Out you totally should.
Oh that's what i'm freaking talking.
About i obviously packed at emma glow on.
The cheek and i'm also gonna put it.
Underneath the brow bone and in the.
Inner corner and just as a side note i.
Would definitely recommend applying.
These highlighters with a wet brush.
Using a tiny i'm 515 detail brush so i'm.
Going in with a little bit more of a.
Highlighter with a wet brush and i'm.
Just gonna intensify at the inner.
Corners i'm also going to use this brush.
To highlight my nose next i'm gonna go.
Back into my blush brush in my in shade.
And just go right over the blush and.
Highlighter again to make sure they are.
Nice and blended together to line my.
Waterlines today i'm going to use the.
Makeup rubber lip pencil in the shade of.
20 this is just a pink liner that is.
Hopefully safe for the waterline i.
Honestly wish it didn't unrest gear up.
But now that i did there's no going back.
So i'm gonna pop on the lily lashes in.
The style lux just so it doesn't look.
Funky so since i did everything out of.
Like a weird order i guess everything is.
Kind of done except for the lips which.
Is strange this feels really awkward i.
Feel like i've been million more things.
To do but i guess we're done to be.
Perfectly honest this foundation.
Combination is not my favorite i do feel.
Pretty cakey but at least i tried.
Something new for all you guys that were.
Complaining i'll be using the same.
Products you're freaking welcome back to.
The makeup forever stick for the next.
Video i don't really know what i want to.
Do with the lips for this look but my.
First instinct is i need to block them.
Out and then do highlighter so i'm going.
To try that first.
Mmm okay i hate this let me find a lip.
Color and i'll be right back.
Oh okay yes much better i just applied.
My over liquid lipstick in the shade the.
Bronx is my morphe 1 6 0 - 18 fresh.
It's just a liner brush i always usually.
Do my black lips like with a liner brush.
Just because it's so much easier and.
Once you mess up you can never go back.
So better to be safe rather than sorry.
Once my lipstick has dried down i'm.
Gonna go in once again with that soy.
Crushed minerals highlighter and my.
Morphe 705 brush to pack that oughta.
Make a metallic lip.
Alright guys and this is the completed a.
Monochromatic pink glam for today i'm.
Honestly loving for this whole like a.
Monochromatic one color glow thing it.
Was really fun to just sit down and.
Experiment like i said in my last video.
