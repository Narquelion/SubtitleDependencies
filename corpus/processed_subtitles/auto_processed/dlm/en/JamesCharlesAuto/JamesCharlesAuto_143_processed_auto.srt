Hi sisters jean-charles here welcome.
Back to my apartment come on you guys oh.
My god i am literally so beyond excited.
For today's youtube video if you guys.
Have been a true sister subscriber you.
Would know that since day one i'm moving.
To los angeles in to this apartment.
I've been saying i'm gonna do an.
Apartment tour and guess what i have not.
Done an apartment door i've been here.
For about a year and a half now i like.
It i definitely do not love it and that.
Is why i wanted to do the apartment tour.
Today because i'm gonna show you guys my.
Little sister suite my sister shelter.
But i'm carly in the market for a sister.
Sanctuary which will be a house.
Hopefully in the very very near future.
It has been a huge goal of mine i really.
Really love architecture interior design.
It's when i fear things in the entire.
World i feel like i've done a pretty.
Pretty decent job at this apartment and.
I'm not gonna be here for much longer so.
I'm gonna show you guys what i've done.
With the place i'm really really proud.
Of it and i hope you guys enjoy it too.
Music.
So as soon as you walk into the sister.
Shelter we have the kitchen which is.
Probably by far the least used place of.
The entire house but of course we do.
Have our regular stove our microwave.
Where i cook ramen in our dishwasher.
Which does not get used very often.
Because we have paper plates.
And then over here we have this like.
Weird little breakfast nook cabinet.
Situation on this wall i really really.
Love burning candles the sister sense of.
Down panel i can sometimes be a little.
Bit so stir spooky so i definitely loved.
Light candle then i have my little bowl.
That house my earpods my wallet and my.
Keys because i'm always losing i miss.
Placing them so i figured might as well.
Just put them there on my toaster oven.
If i ever cook avocado toast and then.
Just a coffee machine it so i can make.
My coffee in the morning with of course.
My good morning sisters mug for lima.
Home so although we don't do a lot of.
Cooking it you guys know i definitely do.
A lot of eating that is for sure i am.
Definitely a foodie i order from so many.
Restaurants in la and i'm always having.
Friends over here so having a really.
Really nice dining set up for all my.
Friends and family to eat while they're.
Together is a very very important part.
Of this house disclaimer most of this.
Furniture and this property is actually.
From ikea the city was not hashtag.
Sponsored but at hashtag should be.
Because when i buy my sister sanctuary.
In case you did not know real estate in.
Los angeles.
Exactly in the cheapest so a cicero is.
Going to be broke so ikea if you want to.
Hit a girl up i'd love to have you.
Furnished the new sister's house when i.
Get it regardless i just have these.
Place settings on here that i got from.
Cv to this cute little bench so a bunch.
Of people can sit on here and we can.
Sister squeeze wow so many good sister.
Fruits that i like i said i definitely.
Have had a huge interested in interior.
Design since i've been very very little.
I'm a huge fan of pinterest.
I literally have boards and boards and.
Boards and boards of different.
Inspiration photos and these chairs have.
Actually been on my like a wish list.
Since i was literally like 11 or 12.
Years old swear to god i'm not kidding.
So the second that i moved into this.
House i ordered a ton of these chairs.
They are super super comfortable and i.
Use them for a dining purposes above the.
13 people we have two very very large.
Hanging light pendants when i moved in.
Here we literally had to get a 20-foot.
Ladder and climb all the way up to the.
Sister ceiling to install these light.
But i love love love how they look and.
It was definitely very much worth it and.
I'm definitely not climbing up there.
Again when i move out so hopefully the.
Next tenants like these lights and then.
Finally on the wall we just have these.
Two posters which i absolutely love.
Once again from ikea the first one is.
From andy warhol from the modena musi in.
Stockholm sweden this has been a huge i.
Don't my voice let's forever i have a.
Bunch of them all throughout my.
Apartment i really really love andy.
Warhol as well i think he's a very very.
Inspiring artist and then my favorite.
Quote of all time work smarter not.
Harder.
That is like my all-time a favorite.
Quote to live by i say all the time it.
Is my phone wallpaper connected to the.
Dining room was actually obviously the.
Kitchen it but also the living room and.
The office where i get all of my work.
Done throughout the day so along this.
Wall we have a bathroom right over here.
Which we don't need to go into this is.
Why i sister you don't need to see that.
Along this wall we have our office and.
This is probably one of my favorite.
Walls in the entire house because this.
Is where i'm spending most of my time so.
I really want to make sure it was super.
Super cute and a space that inspired me.
So once again i have my little table.
From ikea and of course the alex drawers.
Of course you guys know with my job we.
Have to say very very connected all.
Throughout the day it is vital to the.
Existence of me and all your sisters out.
There so this is where all the work gets.
Done we have my huge imac which i love.
Love love working and editing on we have.
My phone charger an apple watch charger.
And then my laptop for work on the go.
And then my sister i've had which i.
Always used for taking notes sketching.
Things down and just planning out.
Different video concepts when decorating.
I knew i wanted to put the desk there.
But that.
Left a very very large and kind of.
Awkward wall space that i knew i needed.
To fill so i feel like a pretty good.
Design tip queen of hgtv and spill it.
With a very very large buck face and.
Lots of different decor pieces and that.
Is exactly what i did i have a printer.
Right next my computer so i can print.
Out any files or contracts that i need.
You to sign some different books my.
Favorite youtubers i have a few.
Different awards this is from the shorty.
Awards when i want it for break out.
Youtuber last year thank you sisters for.
Always being the absolute best of course.
I have this little ampersand because i'm.
An internet relatable team and then once.
Again to some little plants here and.
There to keep everything alive so.
Obviously all my work gets done in my.
Office but if we move just right over.
Here to the living room and this is.
Where all the fun that starts to happen.
I'm actually very proud of how this room.
Turned out because decorating it was a.
Little bit of a challenge when i moved.
In here obviously a lot of the walls are.
White on the inside but all the outside.
Walls because this was a cornered unit.
Are made out of brick which makes.
Decorating it so incredibly hard because.
Not very many things match with burnt.
Orange a red tones i try to convince a.
Building's help me paint it white they.
Would not budge i don't blame them it's.
Still a little bit sister selfie about.
It but i feel like i did my absolute.
Best so of course we just have this very.
Very large and extremely comfy couch.
From ikea we have lots of different gray.
At white and black throw pillows to add.
Just a little personal flair and to make.
Light here a lot more comfortable.
I've taken a so many sister siestas.
That's a nap in spanish i'm so cheesy up.
In this couch of course in the middle of.
The living room we have this little like.
Coffee table that i got once again from.
Ikea and i'm not having like a full-on.
Meal and if i'm having more of a little.
Bit of a lazy day i'll sometimes eat on.
Here or put my feet up if you may have.
Noticed in this apartment i actually do.
Not have a tv and that is because.
Instead of a tv i have a projector which.
Is probably literally the best decision.
That i ever made in my entire life i.
Have it right under here on the bottom.
Shelf and it projects right over to here.
A big screen that pulls down right above.
My office i actually really really love.
Having a projector instead of a tv.
Because it relies on the lack of light.
Obviously work hello.
So it forces me to get my work done.
During the day because i can't use it.
And then at night once they have.
Everything done and i'm hanging out with.
Friends i can always pull this down.
Watch on netflix on my apple tv.
I also have an xbox down here which i.
Got for the sole purpose of playing a.
Black ops zombies literally the queen.
Event and a wii which literally hello.
And nostalgic memories i will crush you.
In mario kart if you ever come over and.
That is a promise moving right along we.
Probably have the part of the apartment.
That you guys have seen the absolute.
Most from a snapchat and instagram.
Stories and that is the sister selfie.
Mirror i literally love this huge.
Oversized mirror once again from ikea.
The lighting is literally the best here.
Because it's actually in the corner of.
The apartment so there's light coming.
From both this window and this window.
Which makes my highlight reflect on both.
Sides which is literally so good so.
Fresh as you can see i definitely have a.
Lot of plants in here i really really.
Love the look of greenery and plants but.
They're all fake because literally every.
Plant or flower that i've ever owned in.
My entire life has died and then last.
But certainly not least we just have my.
Little keyboard sitting here on the.
Floor it's so sad looking literally one.
Of the first things that i buy when i.
Get my new sister sanctuary is going to.
Be a huge huge huge professional.
Beautiful grand piano i literally cannot.
Wait but for right now we'll just have.
To deal with this keyboard that i got.
From amazon but whenever i want to learn.
To practice a new song that i'm loving.
Or at work on something myself who knows.
What the future holds in case you missed.
It which i really don't know how you.
Would because it is up sleek huge right.
Smack that woodinville the living room.
It's just insanely beautiful spiral.
Staircase which i am literally so in.
Love with and is actually one of the.
Main reasons i caught this apartment in.
The first place when i was growing up.
For some reason i've always had a huge.
Infatuation first tile staircases i.
Always just thought they were so cool.
And i'm gonna miss this a lot when i.
Move out but this apartment is actually.
Two different stories so of course we.
Have the bottom level the living room.
With the kitchen the filming room and.
The closet which we're gonna get into a.
Little bit later and i'm so excited to.
Show you guys but upstairs we have of.
The loft and that is where i get my.
Sister sleep so let's go up there i've.
Actually never fallen down this thank.
God but several of my friends have sorry.
Who's loved you the most the main.
Problem with the upstairs area is that.
There's no window up here which is so.
Beyond fresh shooting i only have one.
Little string of lights above my bed.
Which do very very little and it also.
Gets really really hot up here too.
Because obviously we're on the second.
Floor and heat rises it can sometimes be.
A little bit sisters sweaty at night but.
I still do love this base i think having.
A.
Locked bedroom is so cool because.
Obviously we have the railings and i get.
To look over everything kind of see the.
Full apartment which is such an insane a.
Beautiful view and if i ever have a home.
Intruder i can scizor spot them before i.
Die of course we have my bed at right.
Here in the middle with some white bed.
Teeth just to match the aesthetic we.
Have a little bit of a blanket once.
Again for the la winters if it gets cold.
Those little table lamp that i have next.
To my bed i really really love this it's.
Just super cute and it's bendable so i.
Can kind of move it in any direction.
That i want it to a large jay painting.
Because i'm doing like i said i don't.
Really put that much time up here anyway.
Just to a sister sleep and occasionally.
Sisters talk and then moving down the.
Sister style staircase of course we have.
A dis door right here which leads to the.
Closet i'm gonna save this room for last.
Because by far the best of the entire.
House and i am so excited to show you.
Guys that but if we walk right across.
The living room and dining room we get.
To this door right here which you guys.
May have seen in videos a few times but.
I've never really given you the grand.
Tour and this is where all the magic.
Happens.
The sister studio i'm so good at as soon.
As you walk in in the main space once.
Again we have a very very large.
Bookshelf we just have a few different.
Knickknacks some picture frames these.
Pictures of me my best friend laura and.
The entire world we have this little.
Poster that my mom made me saying makeup.
Is my art you guys are gonna say that in.
Every video at this point before we get.
A few different candles at different.
Plants some storage items we have my.
Amazon alexa so i can always listen to.
Music while i'm getting glam hashtag now.
Sponsored by amazon's go ahead a sister.
Up i love to do a brand deal with you.
Guys and then down at the bottom we just.
Have a bunch of different equipment from.
Audio recording stuff to sd cards.
Batteries different cords different.
Chargers different lenses different.
Cameras this is like my videographers.
Dream area of the house and she keeps.
Everything there so you can say it's.
Super organized and get ready whenever.
We're being issued during the day i've.
Been moving this way once again we have.
The dream studio and for some reason not.
A lot of gd gurus like to show this i.
Think it's because getting a perfect.
Lighting setup is obviously a very very.
Difficult thing it took me a lot of.
Trial and error and a lot of different.
Really really ugly looking videos but i.
Finally have a setup that i am super.
Proud of so this is kind of what it.
Looks like this camera and lens and.
Lighting setup not gonna lie was.
Extraordinarily expensive it really bit.
My bank account for a hot minute but.
I've been saving up for it for a very.
Very long time and like i said having my.
Video quality be the absolute best i.
Could be for you guys or something it's.
Always been it very very important to me.
So it was down.
Worth the investment clearly all this.
Equipment together isn't exactly the.
Prettiest it's definitely pretty pretty.
Cluttered and busy in here but all these.
Items work very very nicely together.
So when i sit down i feel me using a.
Video this is what it looks like and.
Like i said this is taking me years to.
Get to this quality but i am finally so.
Beyond happy with the camera quality of.
My youtube videos and this is what you.
Guys see and every single sister james.
Channel video when i'm actually sitting.
Down to film this is what the general.
Setup looks like right in front of me i.
Have my makeup table once again from.
Ikea i have a trash bin below for all my.
Last crises and my makeup wipes that i.
Use and my drawer here i just have a.
Bunch of different mix-match stuff from.
It different handheld mirrors fixed paws.
Some makeup lights and of course all my.
Little tools like my tweezers my beauty.
Blenders or little scissors to cut my.
Lashes i of course my makeup brushes.
Over here i have this big standing.
Mirror right here on the corner of the.
Table that isn't in the camera frame but.
I can definitely still see myself and.
Then on the other side we have this.
Beautiful tv monitor which is suspended.
From one of the light poles and this.
Actually is connected to my camera so.
I'm able to see myself live and make.
Sure that my angles are good the.
Lighting is good and to see if it stops.
Recording so this is kind of how.
Everything works together to really.
Create our really really awesome youtube.
Video right above me when i'm filming a.
Video i have this boom microphone and.
This catches all the sisters sound and.
Then behind the one i feel of course.
Have my backdrop so you guys know why.
Youtube videos are always stoned at home.
Too based all on a white wall and over.
Here we have the holy grail closet tada.
The makeup you guys have definitely seen.
Some vlog style clips of this kind of.
General makeup storage area and i was.
Originally planning on doing a full on.
Like makeup collection tour because it's.
Like every beauty guru ever and the.
Entire broth has done that but i.
Literally got to the point where my.
Collection was completely overflowing.
Which was definitely not cute at all so.
I actually went through and got rid of.
And by got rid of i mean donated like.
90% of my makeup collection and now i.
Kind of only had my like favorite.
Products that i reached for on an.
Everyday basis and it honestly feels so.
So so good so i think i can just kind of.
Go over in general what i have of course.
I have that setting space up here.
Beauty blenders lashes different skin.
Care foundations tanners powders blushes.
And bronzers concealers and he dragged.
Or like more art type makeup looks.
Glitters more glitters liners brows.
Highlighters lip liners and a regular.
Lipsticks liquid lipsticks lip glosses.
Some single eyeshadows.
And makeup cleansing wipes down here i.
Have isil up health and down here i have.
More excess lashes for a beauty guru i.
Feel like this is a very very small.
Collection and for me.
Having everything nicely organized and.
All together makes it so easy for me to.
Pick out makeup before i'm doing a look.
Before i'm filming or if i'm putting.
Something together so i really really.
Love the system that i have going on.
Thank you to its sister desi perkins for.
The organization tips she did a full.
Video on her beauty room tour and this.
Is literally it's so insanely helpful.
And these make organizing everything so.
Incredibly easy and really really easily.
Accessible on this top shelf i have at.
Various different wigs from whenever i'm.
Feeling maya and dragged fantasy and.
Want to go from a brother to a true.
Sister these are so fun and they're just.
Displayed on these little styrofoam.
Heads and then right next to it the.
Makeup storage i have my youtube.
Subscriber plaques which are probably my.
Most prized possession of all time i.
Cannot wait to get a house and display.
This literally in the front.
Walk-in hallway to say yes that's me but.
I'm so proud of these and i keep these.
Where i see them every single day in the.
Make up filming room i love this room.
I'm here majority of my time so i really.
Wanted to make it really really special.
And really really cute obviously but i.
Think it's finally time to move on to it.
The last room of the house if you follow.
Me this way out right across the.
Apartment we have probably my favorite.
Room in the entire house oh this is the.
Walk-in closet the first thing that you.
See when you walk in is of course this.
Huge holding rocker right here and on.
Here is all the items from sisters.
Apparel displayed a loud and proud.
Obviously fans know you can get all your.
Sister's merch and gear as sisters -.
Apparel calm right here on this wall.
Once again we have another large selfie.
Mirror if i put on a new outfit at ways.
Like to stay here and pose in front of.
It and see if it looks good on me if it.
Frames the body well if the fine is.
Looking good or flat it's usually.
Looking flat but i can see it right here.
I custom designed this entire storage.
Unit from ikea once again not sponsored.
But literally so good they actually have.
A thing on their website where you can.
Put in the dimensions of your room with.
Walls and doors and everything and.
Design a full-on closet storage thing so.
This is actually what i was able to come.
Up with and i am literally so happy with.
It so proud it just stores everything so.
Efficiently and i'm able to organize.
That really really well so and then i.
Only have this beautiful leather pouf.
Which is great for sitting on if i have.
Any friends over if i have my stylist or.
Designer over helping with outfits they.
Can sit right here and sometimes because.
The bow.
Was right there i'll come out of the.
Shower and fall asleep on here.
Butt-naked it's very very comfortable.
That was probably too much information.
You didn't need to know that regardless.
The poof i think i ordered this from.
Amazon i believe and then of course a.
Just little carpets what's sisters soft.
Right here the first storage area i have.
Our shoes and like i said i really.
Really love shoes starting at the top i.
Have all my boots from my wire cells my.
Louboutins some timberlands some yeezys.
That runs different mix-and-match shoes.
For the most part they're all adidas i.
Absolutely love adidas you guys know.
Where it literally all the time from.
Shoes shirts and jackets everything and.
Then of course we have my everyday go to.
The balenciaga switch you can see me.
Wear it almost every single picture i'm.
Sorry they're really really comfortable.
And they're super cute we have a cute.
Little sister's poster and then i feel.
Like her bag i think literally every.
Beauty guru ever has like 80 million.
Chanel bags little purses.
Do you are a louie vuitton and the top.
Traders have some accessories i don't.
Really wear that many of them so i don't.
Have this drawer like very very fall but.
Definitely nice just to have them just.
In case my earrings you guys always see.
Me wear the same one of my little lock.
Knuckles that i always wear from louie.
Vuitton and then of course my bracelets.
That are way too expensive but i've.
Saved up for my entire life and i've.
Definitely been a beauty guru staple.
Item that everybody has so i don't.
Really have them in accessories but.
Anything that i have is stored right up.
In here this deck story have my hats.
Which is actually thank god our drawer.
That i don't really touch that much.
Anymore like i said if you've been.
Following me since day one a little you.
Sad the ugliest man bun and they have.
Terrible and these faithful hats were.
Glued to my head i just loved the way i.
Looked in them most of because i hated.
The way i looked.
I hope moving back a little bit here's.
Where i have all of my like more formal.
Pieces or my moral long pieces so i have.
All my different jumpsuits you guys know.
I love a good jumper that i feel so good.
So powerful so like street wear ninja.
Type of look when i have a good jump.
Suit on so i have my graduation jumpsuit.
My sister jumpsuit and a few other ones.
My overalls are all up in here i have my.
Coachella looks for archival purposes.
You need to get them framed out i have.
All my different suit jackets for want.
To go to fancy events i literally hate.
Wearing suits so i don't really have too.
Many of them but i have a black a red.
And a blue it's just in case whatever.
The color coat is and then a few.
Different white dress shirts as well so.
Moving on to this wall right over here.
We have my more every day at casual.
Stuff that i'm playing from all the time.
This is mostly like shirts.
Sweatshirts jackets and hoodies.
Obviously you guys have seen a general.
Theme with me i don't really like to.
Dress up that often but i can still rock.
A really really beautiful it's lame look.
And make it sophisticated with a.
Sweatshirt.
It just works trust me obviously you.
Guys can see that i have a very very.
Strict color scheme when it comes to my.
Outfit being white and black and gray.
Okay see i'll throw in a little bit of.
Color which is all stored in this drawer.
Right over here but that is very very.
Few and far in between so so doing over.
Here we have all the white and gray.
Pieces once again mostly sweaters i have.
My underwear and socks drawer over here.
What you definitely do not need to see.
And then just some various different.
T-shirts which are not very organized.
But they're there just in case i want.
Them i really love this middle section.
This is where i keep all of my different.
Jackets and kind of like more heavy.
Pieces so i have like 87 million.
Different denim jackets i absolutely.
Love them and a few different pieces.
That are custom made by one of my fan.
Pages salads our illustration he paints.
My face on the back of jackets hello.
That is the coolest thing in the entire.
World i love these so so so much i.
Always keep them right there in case i.
Want to once again so promo a little bit.
Because something wrong with that some.
Green or camo jacket and then a whole.
Lot of some block farmer jackets some.
Cropped jacket some adidas jackets.
Champion chanel ysl everything is kind.
Of in there if it's an outerwear type of.
Piece in this top drawer i have my.
Sister shorts when it gets hot in la i.
Don't really have that many pairs them.
Because i just don't really like the way.
I look in shorts but i just found these.
Recently which i feel a little it's so.
Cute and how loud they're like boyfriend.
Schwartz but you know what's not cute.
The fact that i don't have a boyfriend.
And the second drawer down i have all my.
Pants and i've been obsessed with.
Getting really really cool pants.
Recently for some reason i don't know.
Why it's just so fun i literally used to.
Wear black skinny jeans every single day.
I probably have like 30 pairs of just.
Blocks and jeans literally or right here.
They're all from laura's boutique use.
Code days for 10% off they fit amazingly.
But i was just getting so bored of them.
And i looked the exact same every single.
Day i've been trying to spice it up a.
Lot recently and then in this drawer we.
Just have my sweat shorts which i would.
Wear if i was ever gonna work out which.
I'm not let's be real so the stores.
Probably completely who's this and then.
A few different two-piece sets and then.
Finally on the bottom we have my like.
Sweat pants slash casual pants type of.
Drawer i love this shore this is where i.
Keep all my adidas track pants that i.
Wear all the time and some different.
Corp and pieces that i've been upset.
Recently as you can see i definitely.
Like a very very casual item i like to.
Be very very comfortable while still.
Spicing up the office somehow and then.
Finally last but not least the last.
Section of the closet is all the way in.
The back or right here and this is where.
I keep all of my block pieces and i know.
It looks a little bit barren right now.
Almost everything is in the wash.
I picked a very very bad time to fill my.
Closet tour but you know what we're.
Gonna make it work obviously you guys.
Know that i wear a hold on a block so.
This section is literally usually like.
Filled to the freakin brim but there's.
Just some really cool pieces out here.
Like about geography a few different.
Crystal pieces that i haven't worn yet.
Some unreleased this is apparel items.
What could that be i don't know and then.
Just some fun pieces like this a furry.
Jacket but for the most part i think.
That's actually it for the closet tour.
Like i said i definitely will go more in.
Depth in a future video when i move into.
The new house but that's everything i.
Think we're done already sisters i think.
That is it for this apartment tour today.
I really really hope you guys enjoyed it.
I know i've been saying that i was gonna.
Do one since moving in here literally a.
Year and a half ago but i just honestly.
I've never gotten time to it i'm always.
Working i always have boxes and people.
Over every single day so it's placed a.
Little bit messy but i figured it was.
Finally time since i'm leaving it very.
Very soon.
To kind of set everything up make it.
Look really really cute and show you.
Guys what i've been able to do with the.
Place over the past year i'm really.
Really happy with how it turned out and.
I really hope you guys liked it as well.
And got some inspiration and design at.
Tips i know that i'm so beyond blessed.
To be living alone in the middle of los.
Angeles california and this huge.
Beautiful apartment i literally pinch.
Myself every single day because it feels.
Like i'm in a walking a magazine in this.
