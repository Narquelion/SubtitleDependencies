Hi sisters team charles here and welcome.
Back 20 youtube channel you guys i am so.
Good excited because today we are.
Finally back in business with a.
Regularly scheduled and makeup video and.
I am so beyond pump but also low-key not.
Like nervous but i just like don't know.
How this video is going to go so like.
I'm skeptical right now there is a huge.
And i think really really funny trend.
Going on youtuber basically people are.
Going to different fast food restaurants.
And letting the car in front of them.
Decide their order you can basically end.
Up with like a four-piece happy meal.
From mcdonald's.
Or like 18 different doritos locos tacos.
Grande chicken chalupas talked about and.
You have no idea what your actual wheel.
Is gonna be until you get to the final.
Window which is literally so crazy i.
Figured it'd be so much fun to try to.
Figure out how to kind of it turn this.
Concept into a makeup video now i do.
Want to give credit to all my favorite.
Creators taught right now me up maples.
She did someone think a few weeks ago.
And her buddy was so much fun to watch i.
Will leave a link down below if you guys.
Want to check it out but i want to do.
Some one thing today so basically we're.
Going to head to ulta and let the people.
In front of me in line pick my makeup.
Routine.
Now obviously ulta does not have like a.
Drive-through window where i can just.
Pull up and be like i'll take whatever.
They're having although that is a good.
Idea to send me an email of how fat and.
Also most people tend to not go in and.
Spend like a thousand dollars on a full.
Fraser sheen at one time out there on a.
Sister shopping spree go off girl like.
More power to you risk factor 100.
Percent if that happened to happen today.
I was able to get behind them in line.
That make this video a whole lot easier.
But the chances of that are very very.
Slim so what i think i want to do is go.
Into ulta and i hide away a little bit.
And wait until there's a few people in.
Line in front of me and then hop in and.
Say i want all of that this might not.
Work as well as i thought it was going.
To know now that i'm saying it out loud.
But you know what we're gonna try and.
Regardless we're gonna come back here.
After and we're gonna see if you can put.
Together a full face to make up using.
Whatever the people in front of me in.
Line purchase at the makeup store let's.
Go sign.

Time to know because there were so many.
People in line and they all had lots of.
Items and bits and bobs which is good.

No we've had no highlighter yeah okay.
Okay this is a perfect another option oh.
The rock alter-ego lipstick i milani lip.
Stick and elf ultimate foundation brush.
Okay this is good and that's the not.
Least you have an anasazi eyebrow.
Definer okay i usually use the brow is.
But this can work too.
In the shade medium brown okay good.
That's my color all right you guys well.
I feel like this is a very random but.
Also a very very successful makeup haul.
I'm pretty sure we have every single.
Step of our makeup routine covered in.
Front of us and definitely paid off to.
Wait for the store to get really busy.
And wait in line i had it so much fun up.
Meeting everybody in the store today.
That they're all so so so sweet and they.
Also did a really good job picking up.
Making our products so i'm gonna go and.
Unbox my favorites and then let's get.
Started it with a fondant makeup look.
All right you guys i'm gonna get started.
Okay i'm gonna get started to use anyway.
Aveeno ultra common daily moisturizer.
That includes a sunscreen your skin care.
Should always have sunscreen in it.
That's good okay so for foundation today.
I'm not exactly sure let's just try our.
Options okay so we have the maybelline.
Dream cover see what this color looks.
Like okay not too bad honestly at all.
We haven't born this way my all-time.
Favorite foundation in the club worm.
Beige which may already know.
Unfortunately for me is not my color.
Definitely not it we have a makeup.
Revolution in f10 and make a revolution.
In f this day is day for the books and i.
Need everybody to pay attention right.
Now because my foundation is not going.
To match in this video just like every.
Video but this time it's not my fault so.
I think i'm going to mix together the.
Makeup revolution.
Shade 10 which is definitely too dark.
And some of the maybelline one and see.
If we can get a good mix i like put this.
One around like kinda like the edges of.
My face and cover up this awful breakout.
And then i used two maybelline why not.
More towards like the middle of my face.
This isn't that bad like it's it's not a.
Match but i've had worse let's be real.
I've dressed a little bit of the.
Maybelline - and to like the lighter.
Areas we're gonna use our it cosmetics a.
Full coverage complexion brush to blend.
This in okay that color isn't that bad.
Oh my god yes let's mix together our.
Darker shade some cream contour let's go.
Ahead and blend that and it using our at.
Beauty blender now for concealer i'm.
Gonna grab the shade c9 also from what.
Makeup revolution i have associated.
Travis concealers today i've heard such.
Great things about it i'm just going to.
Pop this and all of the same normal.
Areas i'm just gonna go ahead and blend.
That in as well okay i'm kind of liking.
How this is looking a lot i definitely.
Feel like i'm missing a little bit of.
Coverage i was gonna have a tiny little.
Bit of the shape taping out this just.
Right underneath my eyes just for a.
Little bit more lightness and coverage.
But that's that i promise let's grab the.
Next can't stop won't stop setting.
Powder and lock this in place this is.
Actually the only setting powder out of.
All of those makeup bags so hopefully.
They strokes out because we don't have.
Another option this powder looks a.
Little bit dark oh we're just gonna push.
This on there and then we're gonna wipe.
It off hopefully this comes off.
Translucent because this is looking a.
Little bit not correct so squeeze our.
Other elephant foundation brush to wipe.
Away the excess it's like shiny a little.
Bit for some reason which i feel like a.
Setting powder should not be at all.
Oh okay i've liked everything that i've.
Tried so far except for the setting.
Powder i do not like it at all looks.
Like i have white foundation there's.
Stuff but it's completely set down and.
Dry i did not like that would not use it.
Guys now we have to contour we don't.
Really have anything from let's look let.
Me check out the adelaide more.
Importance of a contour suite of that.
And has a color called contour i can't.
Put that on my cheek well i'm gonna grab.
A little bit of i feel beautiful which.
Is deep blush color on that foundation.
Brush and let's use that at least to.
Apply a little bit of a blush that's.
Definitely our very pretty color i guess.
I have to literally use a fluffy.
Eyeshadow brush to contour today i.
Wonder if there's a color in the actual.
Anasazi part let's see yes okay we're.
Gonna go the shade h oe from the alyssa.
Edwards on a salty palate and we're.
Gonna use a little bit of this color to.
Contour i'm gonna be careful because.
This is definitely a dark shade and i.
Don't want to go too intense i'm gonna.
Grab that alpha blending brush that we.
Got in one of the bags and grab that.
Same h oe color and use this too.
Torinos i am happy with this so far so.
Normally right about now i would bake my.
Face to lock everything and please and.
Also brighten up the center but consider.
That setting powder literally is sucked.
I don't really want to put more of it on.
So i guess where it's kind of stuck with.
This so i'm just gonna go right into it.
The brows they god we have the anasazi.
Broad to find her i don't use this one.
Too often but anasazi illiterate makes.
The best brow product so i'm gonna go.
Ahead and do this quickly off care and.
I'll be right back to start off the.
Ominous already knows we were back in.
Both eyebrows are now complete i'm not.
Exactly having the best i brought a at.
This one turned out really good at this.
One not so much but you know what we.
Have phase tuned for reason i'm gonna.
Grab the anasazi beverly hills acts.
Alyssa edwards palette i am so excited.
About this one today i already have my.
Eyes primed with some makeup revolution.
Concealer what i'm just gonna grab a.
Little bit more so it's nice and tacky i.
Really want to use the yellow and the.
Pink and the blue and the purple and i.
Could literally just do a yellow pink.
Purple blue let's try it.
President jh 33 brush on the shaded.
Dreamer i'm gonna pack this on the outer.
Like the type area oh wow that's pick.
Attentive love that just gonna lightly.
Go over the edge of that and kind of.
Blend the color out next with that same.
Brush since i really don't have any.
Other options i'm gonna grab believe.
Which is the kind of lighter purple.
Color and put this right over top and.
Next to dot blue this purple is.
Definitely blending out really really.
Well to it not perfect but purple is by.
Far the hardest shade to formulate when.
It comes to eyeshadows i would know.
Because we literally went through the.
800 million different lab samples of a.
Single and escaped until we got one that.
We were happy with that looks good okay.
Next i'm gonna grab the jh 32 brush and.
Dip into a texas made the bright pink.
Shade and i'm gonna put this right next.
To believe same exact techniques just.
Having the color on there and then.
Lightly.
Buffing them together to blend it out.
Let's grab the jh 42 brush and the color.
Brick road which is deep bright yellow.
I'm gonna pop this on the inner corner.
Wow that is a bright yellow oh wow.
I was literally one dip in the pan too.
And it created all of that pigment that.
Is so crazy i'm gonna try to.
Do that yellow and pink to create that.
Orange color that we want i'm just gonna.
Go ahead and repeat those same steps on.
The bottom lash line okay nice nautical.
Djh of 43 brush and dip into the shade.
Boost and draw out a little bit of a lip.
Blocked lighter wow that looks actually.
Really good i'm super happy with that.
And lost the finally not least on my.
Edge age 39 brush i'm just gonna dip.
Into a headliner the bright white and.
Put a little bit of this in the inner.
Corner just to a little bit already base.
That's pretty much the eye shadow of one.
Eye all complete i am obsessed with.
These colors and this ombre pattern it.
Looks so so good at the blending could.
Be a little bit better but it's.
Definitely my own fault.
I have not done a colorful makeup look.
And literally weeks at this point so i'm.
A little bit rusty not being said.
Practice does make perfect so i'm gonna.
Go and do the other eye off-camera.
Quickly and i'll be right back to finish.
Off the rest of the look already guys.
You're back bold eyes are complete i.
Literally love this look so much i think.
It looks so it's very much like a.
Butterfly ask which i'm so down for.
Alright now that we have a bolt eyes on.
Khurana run oh god i'm angry now that.
Both eyes are now complete i'm gonna.
Grab the benefit roller lash color.
Mascara and apply a light coat of this.
To my lashes and then i'd like to think.
That only god for giving me my early.
Lashes my lily lashes use comb james for.
15% off your order.
These are my all-time favorite lashes in.
The entire world i had no i wear these.
Every single makeup look but you know.
What we're gonna put them on.
All right you guys moving right along.
The next step of our makeup routine is.
Going to be of course the highlighter.
And for that i'm going to grab that gosh.
Champagne pop shimmering skin perfecter.
It has been a hot minute since i used.
This highlighter i remember it not.
Exactly working that well for my skin.
Tone so we're gonna find that out i.
Guess looks so pretty.
Why don't i think this didn't work for.
My skin tone at one point you're.
Literally going we're gonna grab the jh.
39 once again that same clothes that i.
Used to put the white and my inner.
Corners and we're gonna grab some more.
Champagne pop on this and use this for.
My nose highlight gonna probably tide a.
Little bit in the inner corner as well.
All right guys we're pretty much already.
At the end all we have left now is lips.
And we have quite a lot of options we.
Have the lorac pro in ceo that will be a.
Good color with this lock okay.
She's definitely a contender anasazi a.
Spice that is such a pretty color but i.
Feel like it's a little bit too like.
Orange ii for this particular type of.
Look anasazi uh yes i liked its color a.
Lot but i don't really want to do a.
Lipstick without a lip liner and i don't.
Actually think we have one of those we.
Have kylie velvet liquid lipstick so not.
A full matte in the color surprised me.
Yeah this would work with this look but.
I don't know if i want a bright pink we.
Have another kylie that this one is a.
Velvet in the shade of commando that's.
Very similar to the anasazi one though.
That i didn't love oh so how about some.
In the color tanya this one is going to.
Be a no i hate that.
That is what my fellow choice actually.
I'm gonna do a little combination i'm.
Gonna start off with the lorac pro one.
In the color ceo because it's a little.
Bit of like a darker mob and then i'm.
Gonna go to the anasazi a kiss in the.
Middle for a nice ombre lip.
Okay a little bit and last but finally.
Not least one less print of the urban.
Decay all nighter setting spray just.
Talked this beautiful makeup looking.
Place.
Alright you guys and i think that is the.
Finished makeup look all complete.
