Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel as.
You guys know it is october meeting it.
Is my favorite time of the entire year i.
Love fall season is so so so so so much.
I'll like the falling leaves and the hot.
Cocoa and the pumpkin spice lattes and.
The cute decorations and.
Trick-or-treating at halloween oh my god.
I literally love it so much and i am so.
Excited as well to get back into all the.
Fun makeup looks like cranberries dark.
Browns oh i am so so so here for it.
Obviously i'm fortunate i live in la.
Well not really unfortunately i love it.
Here but in la it is still very very hot.
So i'm literally dying in this.
Turtleneck and denim jacket but i had to.
Get into the fall mood for you guys.
Sacrifices last night well my fighters.
Over i was editing a video and my friend.
Decided to unbox all my pr boxes on.
Snapchat which by the way if you don't.
Have me ida you should definitely go.
Check me out over there i post on there.
All the time and do lots of fun unboxing.
Rants story times etc but yeah my firmus.
Over here is unboxed everything and i.
Literally realized how much freaking.
Makeup i've been sent in the past few.
Weeks i was a little bit shook because i.
Had like literally 30 boxes to open but.
I was so excited to try a ton of view.
Products for today's video i grabbed a.
Bunch of products that are new releases.
Or products that i have not yet tried.
Out and did a full face of fall first.
Impressions makeup and i absolutely love.
How this look turned out spoiler alert.
Almost all the products that they use.
Today are really really really great so.
Without further ado if you'd like to see.
How i created this look today using all.
Brand new products that are actually new.
To my regular routine because i know.
Sister james is not switch it up very.
Often gyri picady junkies and let's get.
Started alright guys so i'm first gonna.
Start off by priming my face using the.
No horrible um primer from touch and.
Soul this is a smooth and pore covering.
A top-secret for perfect makeup primer.
And i'm very very excited to try this.
Out i know a sister jeffrey twice about.
This all the time on his channel and.
Absolutely stands by it.
I for one haven't actually never tried.
It before so i'm very pumped you guys.
Know that my skin has actually been a.
Pretty good recently because i've been.
Moisturizing a lot but i definitely.
Still have a lot of pores unfortunately.
Oh wow this feels really good so three.
Seconds in and i already like this.
Primer it feels so incredibly like.
Smooth and the poreless but that being.
Said i absolutely have no product on my.
Face right now so let's go to some.
Foundation and see how it actually holds.
Up.
For foundations today are gonna be going.
Into the milk makeup blur liquid.
Foundation and this isn't the shade of.
Golden light i hope this is the right.
Shade for me.
These released a few weeks ago on a milk.
Makeup but i actually have not gotten a.
Chance to try them out but many of my.
Friends really really like this so i'm.
Gonna try it out for myself.
I definitely like a good full coverage.
Foundation and you guys know that i am a.
Hardcore stand of the make up ever ultra.
Oh that's a good match think on of the.
Make up for ever ultra hd stick so it's.
Pretty hard at this point to ever beat.
That one but let's go ahead and apply.
This and see what we think so this is a.
Liquid foundation that is set to dry.
Down in a natural matte formula meaning.
It it's like pretty matte but still has.
Like a little bit of do to it which is.
Definitely the styler foundation that i.
Like you guys know that i am really not.
Digging like the full baked full matte.
Look anymore and i do like a little bit.
Of a natural glow so holding this.
Foundation if it does what it says will.
Be a really really great one for me okay.
So the foundation was all applied and.
Blend out and i don't love it but i also.
Don't hate it at all the match of color.
Is really really good free and i'm.
Definitely like a fan of this it matches.
My scanner pretty well which is a very.
Rare occasion on the channels youtube.
Channel i know you guys always drive me.
For it my skin texture it looks decent.
I've had foundations i think my skin.
Look better and it's definitely hot ones.
That made it look worse i noticed that.
It is deadly so i'm pretty a little bit.
On my nose which i hate you guys know.
That's like my biggest pet peeve when it.
Comes to nose contour not being able to.
Have like a perfect one so not loving.
That the coverage is really really good.
Though because i skin look very very.
Even all that being said i'm gonna go.
Ahead and apply the rest of my routine.
Now and i will come back to the.
Foundation later on and see how it wears.
That everything else later on top.
Obviously i don't have any dupe.
Concealers to try out today so i'm just.
Gonna use my handy dandy shave tape in.
The shade of light okay so actually.
After lang shaped tape over top of the.
Foundation i like how this looks a lot.
More and layered over top especially in.
Like the poor region really really.
Nicely i love my under eyes look right.
Now as well as my nose was fixed by the.
Same tape thank god we're not about to.
Have a walking nose contour today those.
Days are long gone.
I'm gonna go ahead and set my face in.
The normal place he's using the brand.
New two-faced peach perfect modifying.
Setting powder.
I know jackie ina said she loved this.
I've been super looking forward to.
Trying oh and yeah hopefully we won't.
Get any flash like marriage today i'm.
Just gonna make sure any creases that i.
Have under there.
Gone and then just pack on the setting.
Powder oh my god actually smells like.
Peaches ah that sounds the best ever oh.
My god.
Okay whoa talk about a mattifying sign.
Encoder my face looks like as dry as the.
Sahara desert but not like a bad way i'm.
Honestly really taking it but i'm.
Definitely gonna have to apply a lot of.
Highlighter later on ask for the actual.
Powder first of all it smells literally.
The best like this is really really good.
I don't think i've ever had a setting.
Powder that actually smelled like good.
And not like actual death or like.
Grandma which is my so i like this a lot.
And looking up close my pores are like.
Gone like literally they look so covered.
And filled in this honestly may very.
Well be a brand new favorite i know i.
Don't really like baking any more but.
I'm gonna go ahead and use this powder.
To lightly baked just to see if it does.
Bring any intensity and brightness back.
To the face especially i like the nose.
Contour region underneath the contour.
Like i always do.
But before i do that i'm gonna go ahead.
And stretch my face a few times using.
Some mac fix+ just because i'm looking.
Extremely dry right now and i need some.
Of that hydration bra back at my vegas.
Now let's get up nose as usual using my.
Beauty blender and pack it on to the.
Areas that i want to be a little bit.
Brighter before i actually go to my.
Brows i'm gonna add a little bit of.
Blush using the brand new anasazi a.
Blush kit and the shade radiant i would.
Normally do this before i actually make.
My face but it completely slipped my.
Mind i'm gonna use this shade in the top.
Right hand corner called coastline it is.
So pretty under mine see a little bit of.
The amok in the shade peaches which you.
Guys always my multi-faith and i'm just.
Gonna apply this using my more pe4 brush.
Well that is really pigmented okay so we.
All know anastacio does not play around.
When it comes to pigment but i deftly.
Put on a little bit too much i'm gonna.
Grab my ours your brush from morphe and.
Just my face powder and go over that a.
Little bit to kind of make it a little.
Bit more subtle so now that my face is.
All done and baking the oven at 350.
Degrees we have a little bit of a.
Cooking malfunction there but we're.
Gonna go ahead and move on and next is.
Going to be the brows today i don't have.
Any new brow products to try out for you.
Guys so i'm just gonna go in with my.
Normal benefit brow products i'm gonna.
First go in with the benefit car brow.
Gel in the shade number 4 and start to.
To find out the tail as you guys know.
There was actually a really good long.
While where i stopped using pomade.
Products on my brows altogether and just.
Went over to a pencil.
I feel like the old james charles block.
Ira was so so bad and a very touchy and.
Dark subject we should talk about i.
Think what cause that was way too much.
Brow pomade so i just stopped using it.
Altogether but recently i've kind of.
Been getting it back into it just to.
Like really define it the brows and get.
Super super sharp lines and honestly i'm.
Actually kind of living for it we just.
Have to make sure that we don't get back.
Into that original brown style again as.
Always i'm just gonna grab a little bit.
Of concealer on my morphe e43 brush and.
Clean up that bottom edge once eyebrow.
Is all cleaned up and defined i'm gonna.
Grab the 24-hour brow setter and use.
This to brush all the hair stinton place.
I've actually been using this a lot more.
Than the gimme brow gel and i still love.
Gimme brow don't get me wrong but this.
One is clear it just does a really good.
Job of brushing the hair is like into.
Place but also keeping them like.
Literally glued down it's almost like a.
Liquid version of hairspray and it's i.
Like this law so now that the brows are.
All slayed and locked in place we're.
Gonna move on to the eye shadow and for.
Today i do have a new first impressions.
That i am literally so excited to try.
Out and that is the laura lee los.
Angeles cat's pajamas eyes shadow.
Palette i cannot wait so this is the.
Actual palette it is absolutely stunning.
It comes with ten shades for $40 which.
Is only $4 a shadow which is not bad at.
All i will say i have not put this on my.
Eyes but i definitely haven't done a few.
Swatches and this is so incredibly good.
Let's just do like let's just do one.
Just to show you guys i'm gonna go ahead.
And grab the shade of redonkulous on my.
Middle finger we're just gonna do like.
Like you're kidding.
It is so pigmented as manny would say my.
First girl the shade okie-dokie on my.
M45 brush and just uses to stuff the.
Eyelid in place to prepare for shadow so.
First good our way i'm four for one and.
Dip into the shade bomb-diggity and uses.
Of the transition ok whoa those that.
Feel a little bit a kickback on the.
Shadow but i really don't like that oh.
That just means it's really pigmented so.
Hopefully this isn't like the anasazi of.
Self culture point but let's put an.
Apply and see how it blends in oh yeah.
Okay whoa the shade of lee blends out.
Not as vibrant as you see in the palette.
But that is definitely not a negative.
For me at all this shade looks.
Absolutely beautiful as a transition.
Shade in the eyelid crease and it is.
Blending like butter like that looks.
Really really good oh my god.
Yes sister laura i'm next going to grab.
A clean m4a3 three brush and dip into.
The shade of cray-cray and deepen up the.
Crease a little bit you guys a little.
Could knock it over how well these.
Shades are blending together like deezer.
Really really good shadows that looks so.
Good oh my god i'm next to me i have.
Another m4a3 three brush and dip into.
The shade it kooky and use that once.
Again to deepen up the crease a little.
Bit and prepare for the eyelid shadow.
I'm honestly so shocked right now like i.
Was expecting this to be good but like.
This eye look is literally blending it.
Sounds like you guys are watching this.
All go down i'm like whoa if you guys.
Haven't noticed it's actually really.
Really rare for makeup brands to include.
Reds or maroons in their palettes.
Because a red formula is really really.
Hard to perfect and make it pigment in.
It to blend enough on the eyes and the.
Fact that laura included it in her first.
Palette and it's actually like really.
Good is major major points in my buck i.
Can't even tell you i am so so sick of.
Having palettes that are full of.
Beautiful beautiful oranges and there is.
Not a single red shade on my girl.
I need the maroons i need the reds i.
Need the cranberries and this palette is.
Honestly giving it to me so i'm living.
For this for my little gonna grab a flat.
Packer brush and get into the shade in.
One year in fact that on the lid and i'm.
Actually gonna grab some mac fix.
Actually you know what let's go ahead.
And apply on the lid a dry person see.
How that applies then use some fix glass.
You're literally kidding this is already.
So pretty and i haven't even wet it yet.
I'll linder grab more on that same brush.
With my mac fix+ and really pack that on.
There to make it super metallic you her.
Kidding that looks absolutely stunning.
Just out of curiosity i'm also gonna go.
A little bit of that on my finger and.
Try to play it that way i might let just.
See how it looks.
Wow.
This shade is absolutely beautiful just.
Add a little bit more dimension i'm.
Gonna grab a tiny fluffy brush this is.
My m 506 and dip into out the other oh.
My god get it in one ear and out the.
Other.
So freakin clever and i'm gonna use this.
To it deepen up the outer corner a.
Little bit for the news in that stay.
Brush i'm gonna grab the littlest bit of.
The shade oddball and really deep it out.
Just that or a v just to add some more.
Down and then to finish off the upper.
Lid i'm gonna grab my on 513 at one.
Last time and dip right back to cry cry.
And then i'm just going to buff out.
Those edges i love how this is turning.
Out oh my god for the lower lash then.
3.
Brush and the shade of craig right and.
Just put in a light transition shade and.
I always like to make sure especially in.
This outer corner here that the lower.
Lashline and upper lashline shadow are.
Connected what my biggest have peace.
Ever some people have like a nice sharp.
Defined line right here to cut that like.
Powder shadow wing and then all it's on.
The bottom lash line shadow starts but.
They're not connected like there's.
Literally like a i just i really hate.
How that looks so next thing i grab my.
M1 tube for our brush and dip into the.
Shade at kuki and use this to hug my.
Upper or my lower lash line next to my.
Gram i am a five five nine and didn't.
Took the shade it corky and use that to.
Deep it up right up at the lash line and.
Then finally describing a little tiny.
Bit more of oddball.
Just to deepen up that very outer corner.
To highlight the brow bone i'm gonna.
Grab the shade a scatterbrain on just a.
Flat packing brush and it'll brought.
That on there oh wow i'm also gonna play.
A little bit of that on the inner corner.
As well okay i was gonna save all my.
Thoughts until the end of the video but.
I'll just go ahead and say it right now.
Because i feel confident and my answer.
That this palette from laura lee los.
Angeles the cat's pajamas palette is so.
So good i honestly was not expecting.
Anything less than really great from.
Lore but this how it like really it's.
Just beyond great as you can see the.
Shadows blend so well together they are.
Incredibly.
When said if there would be one negative.
Thing about it that i would want to.
Mention is that some of the shadows do.
Have a lot of fallout which i don't see.
A personal problem with it that just.
Means a really pigmented if anything.
Just make sure you tap your brush before.
You actually put it on or just make your.
Face you can wave everything away at the.
End but like i said this palette 10 out.
Of 10 definitely sister james recommend.
Do it alright so i just went ahead i did.
The other eye off-camera super quickly.
And that the eyes are both done i'm.
Gonna apply some lashes today as always.
But i do have a new first impressions.
Today and those are the more feet.
Eyelashes i am obviously a morphe.
Affiliate you guys know that you can use.
Koji's or 10% off or over your products.
I literally say all the time and even.
Have a hoodie with the setting on it.
Also check out section parallel comm for.
All your sisters merch anyway all that.
Being said i was up the morphe office a.
Few weeks ago and i was like looking.
Through all their products and i was.
Like wait a second are those lashes and.
One we hold murphy has lashes which i.
Literally did not even know about they.
Were not announced i just kind of came.
To the store but they look beautiful.
Then i'm gonna be applying in style i.
Traction which look very very similar to.
The house lashes like onyx and they are.
Stunning.
So while i clean all these launches i.
Guess i will give you guys the rundown i.
Absolutely love how the style looks.
Especially with the shape of the eye.
Shadow that i went with today the one.
Thing that i will say about these lashes.
That i don't love is the actual band on.
Them the style of lash is beautiful but.
The band is really really thin and.
Flimsy now some people may like that.
Because it's really easy to like kind of.
Manipulate it but i personally prefer a.
Much thicker and more durable band.
Because i kind of feel like when you.
Come to glue it on it's a lot harder to.
Work with but i feel like that works and.
The fact that it won't come off as easy.
Whereas like now that we have a thin.
Band it's kind of just like flipping.
Around and i really had to make sure i.
Like how's it on their wall gluing it on.
At the end of the day it's really up to.
Personal preference i don't love this.
Lash band like i said but these lashes.
Are only retailing for $10 and with an.
Influencer code they are nine dollars so.
It is much better than like a lily lash.
Or a new balance and watch i just i love.
Them so you guys could totally make your.
Own decision on that but yeah these.
Lashes are beautiful just don't love the.
Band so those are both eyes all complete.
I honestly love how the suck is turning.
Oh so far and then the eyes are done are.
Next up is going to be the glow and once.
Again for the glow i do have a first.
Impressions product and that is the.
Brand new anasazi sugar.
Glow can i.
Gazi basically chose all the favorite.
Highlighters from the individual.
Highlighter palettes before and put them.
All together into one palette what to.
Think is absolutely genius it's like a.
Favorites palette within the actual.
Brand so that is super super dope and i.
Think if we're actually going to go.
Ahead and apply and mix it the shape of.
Butterscotch and starburst today for.
This look as always i'm gonna play using.
Miami.
501 brush i mean this really should come.
To no surprises you guys we all know.
That anastacio always kill that their.
Highlighters i've been using so.
Hollywood in literally every single.
Video for the past like almost two years.
Now but wow i'm sure these are so good.
Now that my highlight is all on i'm.
Gonna grab my blush brush one more time.
Which is my e4 and dip into the shade at.
Terracotta and breeze and this put a.
Little bit of this more on the.
Cheekbones just to kind of blend.
Together the highlight because i feel.
Like it is a little bit too pigmented.
And it's not yeah a lot better there we.
Go i just completely didn't finish my.
Sentence it's a little bit too pigmented.
And it's not blending together for that.
One for the lips today i'm gonna play.
The ofra liquid lipstick in the shade.
Hannah lulu as a base this was literally.
The perfect lip color to use for this.
Look oh my god i think i'm actually.
Gonna take my packing brush and dip it.
Back into the laurel leaf i grab a.
Little bit of porky and in one ear.
Together and make this lip metallic okey.
Whoa adding that shadow was like.
Literally the pounce idea opera this.
Looks so so pretty and was literally the.
Easiest way to make a diy metallic.
Liquid lipstick protip simple diy if you.
Ever have a lipstick that drives down.
Matte but you want it to be metallic.
Just put it on let it dry it out.
Completely and then just layer over top.
With a similar shade of metallic.
Eyeshadow and there you go super easy.
And looks so so good and all that being.
Said this look is all complete so let's.
Go ahead and finish off with a little.
Spritz of urban decay all nighter.
Setting spray.
Alright guys and that is this fall first.
Impressions makeup look all complete i.
Absolutely love how this look turned out.
And honestly i think i pretty much liked.
Almost every sync one of the products.
We've tried today which is so exciting.
Starting over from the beginning the no.
Horrible um primer there we go that's a.
Mouthful from a touchin sole was.
Absolutely wonderful it made my skin.
Feel so so good and super smooth.
Definitely did like a blurring effect.
Which i love next up we use the milk.
Makeup foundation and i was in the shade.
Golden light it was a really really good.
Match for my skin as you can see which.
Normally does not happen on the future.
Channel so that is great it wasn't my.
Favorite product in the world but it.
Also was my least favorite it looks.
Really really beautiful all the skin and.
Is honestly holding up really really.
Well till at least i have a little bit.
Of a problem start with us on my nose.
Which is like honestly a breaking point.
For any foundation for me my nose.
Contour is super super important to me.
And vital to my makeup routine so as.
Soon as a foundation it doesn't sit well.
On my nose that is instantly out for me.
But i feel like the pros of this.
Foundation are outweighing the cons so i.
Like it definitely try that for yourself.
And let me know what you guys think next.
Up we use the laura lee los angeles.
Cat's pajamas eyes shadow palette and i.
Already told you guys what i think of.
This this is so incredibly bomb it.
Launches on october 13 you guys have to.
Check this out one that comes out these.
Shadows girl laura lee kelton let me.
Forget it once again but we also use the.
Anastacio radiant blush palette and i.
Use the shade coastline and terrace and.
Breeze all together so literally three.
Out of the four shades of the palette i.
Really really like the firm of these.
They blended beautifully the only thing.
I will say is that they are super super.
Pigmented so if you check these out just.
Using a very very light hand because you.
Might be looking a little bit crazy we.
Also went in with the new honest cons.
You have sugar lo can't which as you.
Guys know anasazi always kills the.
Cloaca came and i use the shades of.
Butterscotch and starbursts today and i.
Love how the skull looks i mean.
Come on girl it's like so blinding.
Alright guys most of all the new product.
