It's been almost 11 years now i got.
Booked to do a cover shoot with her it.
Was a little local magazine in the.
Hamptons and a photographer of mine.
Called me one night and said hey i need.
You to do makeup for this girl named kim.
Kardashian for this cover shoot tomorrow.
And i was like i kind of heard her name.
She was not famous it was like season.
One of her show we think she was just.
Starting to gonna name here in the.
States.
And i had a job at this other job that i.
Had booked already so i was kind of like.
Touring i'm like you know i can't really.
Do it going in i was like i love it i.
Wound up doing it did her makeup she was.
Very sweet and she took selfies the.
Entire day man you know this is before.
Like and then she asked me to take her.
Makeup shopping that same day we were.
Done oh love i loved it was the first.
Time i really feel like i looked really.
Right like yeah and i just felt like.
Super like this armenian authentic look.
That i just feel like when i would get.
My eyebrows done like it would just kind.
Of like take that away from me and he.
Just like brought that back but in this.
Glam way that i had never seen before.
I had never had my makeup done like that.
Before he was like new right away i just.
Yeah i went back to the hotel and i just.
Took so many eggs i still have them i.
Took so many all the truth.
Yeah on what is it called on your.
Computer on today's photo booth yeah i.
Took like hundreds of photo booth photos.
And i have them all you know what is now.
That she loved was the you know i did.
The baking the contouring the.
Highlighter did all those things in her.
That she liked really loved and.
Never-ending experience before that is.
So cool yeah and then she just got.
Really only getting really super busy.
After that she started requesting me for.
Everything you know i live in new york.
And she was in la so she would start.
Flying me out to la and you know i.
Started working with her doing like all.
Her stuff there what's gonna happen if i.
Like james's makeup better well then.
When i'm in new york living my life.
James can come over here ella said five.
And the more you do makeup sounds kind.
Of fun maybe one person i'm just setting.
It your face lightly in place with some.
Prince's a setting powder to really lock.
It all in there oh oh i'm so excited.
Right now.
Contour james we only have 45 minutes.
And i'm gonna do entire ilog to the.
Crease wow brave you have to give the.
Client what they want.
Thank you cam what has been your.
Favorite looked at marion has ever done.
On you oh that's so hard.
Honestly i really did love our met look.
That we did last year it was very 90s.
Too and i think i've just been really.
Stuck on that with the darker lip and.
Like kind of reshaping how.
Do the upper lip a little bit.
Differently than usual nose humbler know.
Sometimes my favorites that might make a.
Person i love just play making it look.
Like literally i can't thank you i'll.
Have my assistant kim kardashian i'm the.
Same face right on kim's cheekbone turn.
It side honey.
James done her so phil's an hdtv with.
Them hmm.
You mind your business you learned from.
Mario actually favorite track kim.
Obviously now you have kkw which is it.
So amazing and the products are so long.
How i was like starting your own makeup.
Line changed your career and your love.
For makeup it definitely made me see.
Makeup in a really practical way i think.
That a lot of people were really like.
The consumer was really scared of.
Contour but i know all my friends were.
Really scared of contour you're like.
Concealer in you know three steps and to.
Figure it all out so i tried to make it.
As simple as possible and to try to.
Really explain that and bring like the.
Tricks that i learned.
Yeah with mario about the years with.
Mario to the consumer in a really easy.
Way i love about super dope the whole.
Thing with our line is how to take like.
The industry techniques and things like.
That but simplify for the girls at home.
So they can do it super easily right.
Because like kim there's a lot of girls.
At home that you know are not like super.
Artistic when it comes to doing their.
Makeup and you know they just need.
Something easier so i figured i could do.
It you can do it even though i've sat in.
The makeup chair for you know 12 years.
Straight.
I really didn't know a lot about i know.
What i like to look at i know what i.
Like to feel i can tell what really good.
Formulas are and i think you know.
With my k'kaw beauty brand we just have.
Really like perfected the formulas and i.
Just wanted something that was really.
Simple kanga debbie's obvious like a.
Very social media-based brand to with.
You and barbie on switch media so much.
How would you think social media has.
Affected the business i'm like what you.
Do on their day to day life if they feel.
Like obviously plays a huge role it's.
Really insane i mean it's fun to.
Obviously be in a store and to have.
People come out and feel and touch and.
Use the product really you just honestly.
You can it's so amazing to me that you.
Can start a whole business and a brand.
Fund just social media just creating.
Your own world and that's been so much.
Fun is having full control over id.
Campaign images and who you work with.
And what you do and what products you.
Pick and rotor packaging looks like and.
It can be anything you want it to be and.
If something doesn't work you can change.
It is because you want like i don't know.
If i'm mixing up like owning my own.
Business and social media but like the.
Both of them together has been so much.
Fun to have the creative control a.
Hundred percent but i honestly couldn't.
Have done it without mario you know i.
Love his advice and his opinion has it.
Been interesting watching like different.
Makeup people like beauty gurus like try.
The products in seven review it has just.
Like seeing that like my formulas we.
Take a lot of time and put into them so.
Seeing the response online or someone.
That i really love and respect and.
They're trying the shadows and they see.
How pigmented they are they try the.
Lipstick and they say like my new.
Lipsticks or the liners or stuff they.
Use all the time like that makes me so.
Happy.
Right okay i'm gonna grab tuned wait can.
I also get the first thing that we've.
Got because it's because of arielle yeah.
Ariana's ariana grande considers with.
Nora i took her to the concert and mario.
Text me and was like oh my god jean.
There you have to go say hi i was salted.
Attack another james wrote me and it's.
Like oh my god sister kim is here and i.
Want to be her well i wasn't now hold on.
I posted it on my story being there then.
You must watch out chef yes and your.
 under ariana kim's there.
Too and i was like no way.
And then you were like oh i'm gonna text.
Her right now and i was like you're.
Literally ten engage texted her and she.
Said yeah of course i'm coming and then.
Five minutes later this huge security.
Guard shows up in front of i see it's.
Like i'm looking for james i was like.
Think about me oh yeah i was like tell.
Me a seat number then you came over and.
You were so nice i was so nervous to.
Look who's nobody were like a year and a.
Half ago almost two years ago now.
Probably yeah.
So i wasn't super super nervous because.
I was like kind of at the beginning of.
Like my makeup career like i think i was.
Only at like two million at the time of.
Three million maybe so i was like i had.
Never linked that like a celebrity.
Before.
I always like looked up to you and like.
Watched keeping up and sucked so i was.
So excited they put together i think.
Yeah okay so are like your favorite.
Things to do with the kids my kids like.
Very different things so it's really.
Hard to do things all together oh my god.
No this is the key to making up her song.
I need we need to talk about ear and sat.
Down sorry from a few weeks ago that was.
The funniest thing i've ever seen in my.
Entire life.
K'kaw beauty black eyeliner oh i moved.
I'm sorry i moved i didn't know it would.
Cause this much of a big deal my makeup.
Artists usually don't act this way yeah.
He was very confusing because she said.
She wanted to film a youtube video.
Then okay i'll film it on my phone so i.
Started coming in and then she would see.
The camera and then she fall out crying.
Oh so i was just like i you're very.
Confusing so her to work with yeah very.
So that she like did a look and then she.
Didn't like what she saw says she.
Started crying and i was like it's fine.
We'll just you know wipe it off and.
Start over so we did that maybe for a.
Different time whole when finally i just.
Was like i have to give it up this is.
Your final look this is you gotta figure.
It out.
Did i come together on the end it did oh.
God yeah she really liked it so none of.
Those like super into makeup ha yeah she.
Really is yeah she's really into makeup.
Into squishies and my son is just like.
The opposite so she loves to have like.
Friends over do makeup on dolls on her.
On over makeovers it's her thing yeah.
She just likes to play makeover doesn't.
Iike that with with your palette.
Oh don't i'll have my people can i try.
To people submerge she does a really.
Good job like on herself but she's.
Really into making her brows really dark.
Oh because i mean i have lots of.
Experience i feel a bronze to director.
But she just takes a pen you know i'm.
Just yeah that's pretty much what is you.
Bought your stuff over there i've heard.
A lot that i like not so cool so like.
You can give her tips how i would love.
To wait all this right now she is she's.
Afraid okay so as she hadn't a jet where.
Like she actually like wants her makeup.
Her she just playing with that i mean a.
Little bit of both like she's not fully.
There yet where she's like i can't leave.
The house without you know rush on or.
Whatever but she loves like a bright.
Colors lipstick and then if i go in on.
Her like it's if it's like a special.
Occasion like her favorite color is.
Purple and kylie had this color junebug.
And she.
He would wear it all the time then kylie.
Like made her our custom own purple.
Packaging so she'll wear like a lipstick.
Color out and then like she'll ask me.
Like 10 times is my lipstick still there.
It's all there.
Can you see my lipstick is really cute.
Is there a evening cute like letter i.
Start experimenting at maybe like 12 mm.
Maybe 14 i give this question a lot too.
Because i get a lot of parents that like.
Support my youtube channel and say that.
They watch the videos with their.
Daughter or sons which i always think is.
So cool like it means a lot to me and a.
Lot of parents ask me like being like oh.
Well like what parent but what age did.
You start wearing it i started at 16.
Doing my own makeup but i always say.
Like one of my biggest things that i.
Preach on my channel it's like i do not.
Wear makeup like to feel pretty i do not.
Wear makeup because i feel like i need.
To wear a tie breaker because it's fun.
Yeah feeling beautiful and i love like.
Expressing my art and like playing with.
It and seeing like what i can create.
Yeah and i think like because i get that.
Question so for me i owe a sailing if i.
Were to have kids which i never well i.
Would let them play with it whatever as.
Long as i knew like yeah and i think you.
Know the kids see me with with him.
Without makeup on all the time so they.
Know it's not like you know if anything.
There was a point when i would get my.
Hair and makeup done and north which is.
Like start to cry and be like don't get.
Your makeup done.
And cuz she knew that that's when mom.
Had to work right and mom was gonna.
Leave soon after that yeah so she hated.
That but i really do agree with that.
It's like just about being fun it's not.
Really i mean for me when i makeup on it.
Does transform my mood it transforms my.
Whole you know personality what does it.
Do exactly when you have a really.
Amazing makeup on as opposed to when you.
Don't have makeup on like what does it.
Do to you as a woman celebrity i think.
That it from.
It makes me feel more confident when i.
Have makeup on but i think it's the both.
I think it's like hair and makeup but if.
You were to say you can only do one i.
Would pick getting my hair done yeah.
Because i do like natural beauty as well.
Well me years ago i would have been.
Makeup hair i think just like when my.
Hair is done i feel like i can have a.
Not more natural face i don't know i.
Just think that when my makeup is done.
Like really good you just like feel.
Yourself you know i mean you really do.
Really get in to it you just aren't such.
A good mood it just enhances what you.
Have what was the point i'll make out.
Yeah hey she said that only she doesn't.
Want shimmer that's good yeah that's.
Okay to do your own thing sometimes.
Isn't they wind up living in anyway well.
If you pick the shiny end and the good.
News is that he gets to redo this i can.
When you are just getting ready and.
Mario isn't here and it's just you.
How long does your lbd routine take you.
You're really gonna die at this one.
About seven minutes i can do a full face.
In like five minutes.
So she's um she's one of the most.
Incredibly patient people in hindi good.
In the universe such an incredibly.
Common patient but she's just like when.
It comes to doing her own makeup she's.
Like not patient in that sense yeah i.
Just it just went you doing or something.
It just says i'm just like who has time.
To blend all day yeah i just don't i.
Wish i did she's very patient like with.
Other people working on her lately she.
Doesn't really rushed people too much.
So uh right now it's a challenge north.
About the mama challenge.
It'll of jealous she always does like.
Beauty challenges in her room like okay.
We're both gonna get this doll and make.
Up her.
Let's see who has the better luck but.
She always wants to win okay me i think.
We ignored leave that i know kind of.
Fresh so because we're on a time limit.
I'm not gonna do any cream contour i'm.
Gonna go ahead straight into the powder.
Contour thanks father.
Because if this is contour viable.
Contour i'm usually thinking that me.
Beauty reckoning powder this is the new.
One the best.
I still use this all the time ever seen.
I love this powder it's so bomb you guys.
Been working together for a very very.
Long time now that's been incredible to.
Watch your guys's journey and like.
Almost you've created together how would.
You say like your makeup style has.
Changed over the past few years and like.

Makeup style definitely goes in waves so.
Sometimes like we were super glam really.
Into a really light under eye that was.
Like our thing you know really smokey.
Eyes are lashes that we would wear would.
Be like only strips then we got to a.
Really natural place where it was like.
Hardly any shadow now we've started to.
Like glam it up a little bit more it's.
Always fun like what our papa blue or a.
Pop of color you know smokey eyes lots.
Of liner we definitely have like stepped.
