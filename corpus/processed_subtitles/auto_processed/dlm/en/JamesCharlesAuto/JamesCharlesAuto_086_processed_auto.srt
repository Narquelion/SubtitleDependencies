Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel.
Happy holidays sisters i hope everyone.
Is having an absolutely amazing week.
This year apparently santa has decided.
To bring me a sty i have not been able.
To put on makeup for six days now which.
Has been so incredibly inconvenient if.
You've been following me on snapchat you.
Know that literally a few days ago it.
Was so swollen that i could barely even.
Open it so now we have definitely made.
Improvements please do not leave any.
Comments i am well aware of the fact.
That i look like i am looking in two.
Different directions.
We're just gonna roll with it i have to.
Get this video done for today's video.
Have something actually super super fun.
Plan that i am very excited to do in.
Honor of the holiday season.
Obviously the holiday times it's time to.
See your family at time for friends love.
Laughter lots of good food and also the.
Season of giving i personally love.
Giving gifts to all my friends and.
Family it is so much fun for me to be.
Able to think of really really cute.
Things just to give back to the people.
That mean the most to me and this is.
Gonna be the first year that i'm.
Actually not setting up my family on.
Christmas i'm gonna be here in la all.
Alone so in order to compensate for that.
I force all my close friends to give me.
Gifts no but in all seriousness today's.
Video is going to be doing a full face a.
Youtuber christmas presence i hit up all.
My favorite content creators that i.
Really really love and look up to and i.
Assigned each one of them 17 my makeup.
Routine and they all picked out a.
Surprise product and hopefully we can.
Come up with a good luck by the end of.
It without further ado i have my santa.
Hat on or to get into the christmas.
Spirit of opening all these cute gifts i.
Have a ton of pockets here in front of.
Me for all of my favorite youtubers and.
Some of your favorite youtubers so if.
You see someone you love it don't forget.
To give this video a big thumbs up.
Especially if you are enjoying it and.
Let's get started so let's get right.
Into this routine and you guys know our.
First step was always going to be to.
Prime our face so our first christmas.
Gift today it's what my favorite sister.
Sofia 9-yard.
So along with every gift each creator.
Sent me a short cute little video.
Explaining why they picked what they.
Picked let's see what sofia got hello.
James merry christmas i sent you this.
Urban decay quick-fix.
Hydra charge complexion prep priming.
Spray i also bought myself another.
Sample size i don't usually use like.
Primers that you put on with your hands.
I like to spray stuff on my face so.
That's why i send you this and i hope.
You like it.
I feel like i don't have as much.
Experience with primers as you probably.
Do but i do like this one and it smells.
Nice when it goes on your face anyway i.
Hope you like it.
Merry christmas again and a happy new.
Year.
Thank you sister sofia so now that our.
Piece is all primed ready to go our next.
Up is going to be a foundation and for.
This i assigned it the queen of skin.
Talk to us brock hey sister james so by.
Now i'm sure you have looked in the bag.
This is the lemare soft fluid liquid.
Foundation that is expensive but it is a.
Miracle product and i'm curious what.
Your thoughts are on it you already have.
Pretty awesome skin but i think that it.
Is time for you to branch out and try.
New things that are not your makeup.
Forever stick foundation oh okay i hope.
You love it.
I'm curious to see how your luck turns.
Out and i love you lots.
Oh so mama westbrook wanted to come for.
Me today i see how it's gonna be shot.
See let's go ahead a plan is talk to you.
Got me shade number ivory oh - so.
Hopefully it is a good match for my skin.
It's a good match you guys know i'm.
Definitely a very very full coverage.
Type of queen even when i'm doing a more.
Natural look i'll still use a light.
Foundation and just sheer out i would.
Normally never reach for a foundation.
Dish share but i actually feel like it.
Layered beautifully on the skin so i'm.
Very excited to keep using this and.
Trying it out thanks sister tati.
So our next step is gonna be to hide our.
Under-eye bags and make our face nice.
And bright like the star top of the.
Christmas tree and for this we're gonna.
Be using concealer which is sent to me.
By it nicole concilio hey james its.
Sister nicole so my gift to you is tart.
Shape tape because i really feel like.
That was such a staple product of 2017.
It was everybody's favorite and i know.
That you really like it too so i wanted.
To give you a nice gift for the holidays.
Merry kisses thank you sister nicole.
Sent me the shade light which is.
Actually the strange that i use all the.
Time so she's that like a true sister.
Let's go down apply this on all the.
Right places son sister toffee sent us a.
Very very light coverage foundation.
Today obviously you guys know shape tape.
It's a very very full coverage so i feel.
Like these two will balance each other.
Out really nicely to create a beautiful.
Base okay so now that the foundation.
That conceals are all in place obviously.
We have to.
To arkansas it lasts all day long and.
For this i signed no other than sister.
Patrick stir we all know he's the.
Full-coverage queen he always wears tons.
And tons and tons of powder but he still.
Looks flawless somehow so i figured it'd.
Be the perfect person to give me the.
Best powder ever hey superstar happy.
Holidays and ears when i say grab have.
To start powder and patrick fulop what's.
The best gift ever who doesn't let a.
Juicy lip glass shiny look on the lips.
With a classic red it's definitely so so.
Beautiful and i'm the powders that you.
Make flawlessly it's so so gorgeous then.
I hope you guys love it for this holiday.
Season.

I've actually been rocking this a lot.
Lately.
So this'll be the perfect lip later on.
Thanks patrick for chronic turks that i.
Have a package from one my all-time.
Favorite youtubers rob beauty by.
Christie she sent me this pocket right.
Over here let's see what she got us hey.
Sisters today james asked me to pick a.
Contour product and i was like what.
Product should i pick and i thought.
Initially.
Kat von d shade + light i know i love.
That one and i know james does too but.
Then i thought what would james do and i.
Think he would use code james for 10%.
Off so today i decided to go with the.
Morphe 9 c palette so have fun.
Contouring and don't forget to use code.
James like you ever could oh she is the.
Cutest ever and also this pocketing is.
The cute as ever she even added a little.
Bow.
Thank you sister christine i reckon.
Faces all snatch and set and place.
Thanks to sister christie i literally.
Love her and her videos so much and.
Don't forget to use coach change to 10%.
Off this holiday season even though our.
Faces all chiseled out we are missing.
One thing and that is blush when i think.
Of beautiful skin and just happiness and.
Beautiful rosy cheeks.
I think of alyssa ashley.
Music.
Oh this is a beautiful color thank you.
Sister alyssa happy holidays from me to.
You.
Now i'm going to dip into a little bit.
More of patrick's powder and i'm going.
To bake my face so while our base is.
Baking in place at 350 degrees and we.
Are making some beautiful christmas.
Cookies we're gonna move on to the.
Eyebrows normally i would say eyebrows.
Are supposed to be sisters and not twins.
But obviously you want them to be as.
Close as we possibly can get so to start.
My brows in place today i asked my.
Favorite set of twins to send me brow.
Products what's up sister i'm stuck in.
Bed right now unfortunately but for the.
Holidays i was able to send you an expo.
Marker for your eyebrows because i feel.

In the makeup world and it's gonna get.
Your eyebrows looking nice and thick.
Because we love a thick sister happy.

Eyeshadow you guys don't i started.
Updating makeup i was in it for the.
Really really colorful beautiful.
Creative looks and when i think of.
Eyeshadow and really really beautiful.
Vibrant colors i first think of a sister.
Jackie ina.
Hi james it's a girl jackie o what it's.
So do i really have to explain why i.
Chose a pat mcgrath eyeshadow palette.
Come on come on is fab grad like come on.
Seriously you billy you billy pat.
Mcgrath is not only one of my favorite.
Makeup artists but i really kind of feel.
Like you know how to push the envelope.
And the boundaries when it comes to.
Color and playing with the eyes and.
Shadows so i chose one of my favorite.
Palettes from her collection i know that.
You can put whatever your heart desires.
To using that palette so good luck and.
Have fun.
Sister jockeys that we the pat mcgrath.
Mothership palette i've actually never.
I've actually never tried it pat mcgrath.
Shadow before but i've heard they're.
Absolutely legendary pat mcgrath is an.
Iconic makeup artist on it very very.
Excited to play with this today i'm.
First gonna grab the shade dark which is.
This one right here on miami for for one.
And put this on my crease i'm gonna go.
In pretty lightly with this because this.
Power actually does not have a lot of.
Matte shade so i really want to make.
Sure that this is blended out really.
Nicely and doesn't look too crazy next.
Add some holiday cheer i'm gonna grab.
The shade right here called a blitz.
Emerald this is beautiful bright green.
Shade i don't want you to sprint's it.
With a little bit of settings bright and.
Pop this on the lid to create a halo eye.
Effect.
Well that's pigmented that's beautiful.
Oh my god.
Music.
And then for a bright holiday pop of.
Color i'm gonna grab this bronze shade.
Right up in here and a little bit more.
Settings plate and pop this right in the.
Center of the lid all right guys that is.
The shadow i'll complete thank you.
Sister jackie for such an amazing and.
Beautiful palette i had so much fun.
Check out the pat mcgrath shades they're.
Absolutely beautiful absolutely the.
Pigment is literally unreal i'm.
Definitely looking forward to playing.
This in the future and thank you for a.
Challenge as well it has been awhile.
Instead of been able to play with color.
But obviously the eyes are not done yet.
We need to apply the lashes so we all.
Know that a good pair of flirty.
Beautiful lashes complete any good eye.
Shadow look and when i think of a flirty.
Beautiful sister i think of our country.
Gal laura lee let's go ahead and see.
What she picked out for us today hey.
James e wayne z so the last year i.
Picked for you are their little that's.
Just miami our little lashes mikonos and.
I picked them for you to be a good.
Friend because i know you love a big v.

Didn't i just had to be a good friend.
And give you a good old thick lash from.
Lily lashes i hope you enjoyed them i.

The lashes from sister laura lee i also.
Applied some mascara to blend together.

Too much mascara or any eyeliner so if.
They look a little bit wonky your just.
Got to bear with me i'm trying not to go.
Blind here so now that the eyes are both.
Complete we are gonna move on to the.
Rest of the face and of course our next.
Step is going to be the glow when i.
