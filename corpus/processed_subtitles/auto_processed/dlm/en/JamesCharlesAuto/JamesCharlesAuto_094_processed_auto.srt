Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel and.
It's currently a rainy day here in a.
California while we were on quarantine.
And for today today i just wanted to sit.
Down and play with makeup and we're.
Going to do this thing that we actually.
Have not done in quite a long time now.
And that is a makeup challenge now a few.
Weeks ago i was scrolling through tech.
Talk and i saw a really a really cool.
Video of this moment applying her makeup.
Using an airbrush machine now if you.
Don't know what an airbrush machine is.
It is this baby right here basically you.
Pouring little drops right into the top.
Then you turn it on and then you spray.
Your makeup out on to at the face so.
Airbrush makeup is actually not.
Something that is really new to the.
Beauty world it is most commonly used on.
Movie sets and special effects makeup.
Horror film but it is really not a.
Technique that has made its way into.
Like the typical mainstream beauty.
Universe and that is because if you.
Don't know what you're doing it is very.
Very hard so although it's not new to.
The makeup world it is new to me and for.
Today's video i wanted to try out doing.
A full face of makeup using only.
Airbrush machines now i wanna be honest.
Of you guys and tell you that today is.
My fourth time trying to film this video.
So usually i do my makeup challenges and.
You know it's a little bit of a bumpy.
Road but in the end it usually comes.
Together for this particular video.
However it was not doing that it was.
Literally melting all over my face it.
Was spotty i could not get it to look.
Good and i just did not understand why i.
Was getting it so ridiculously angry but.
Then i realized okay this is the makeup.
Challenge obviously i cannot be good at.
Everything and instead of just giving up.
And moving on i want to get this video.
One last shot so i did some research.
Watch some videos and called in some.
Backup and we're gonna try this one last.
Time so if you guys want to watch me.
Into a full face of airbrush makeup keep.
On watching.
Music.
Okay guys before we jump in i want to.
Give it to super quick shout outs the.
First one being to the brand attempt to.
You what they are an airbrush company.
And they heard that i was doing this.
Video so they sent me over a full.
Package of goodies since all the makeup.
Stores are closed and during a.
Quarantine that the to do is not.
Sponsored okay i'm not being paid to say.
Anything i do have some products with.
Other brands as well but i do want to.
Say a major thank you to them and the.
Second channel is to a channel here on.
Youtube but by the name of an airbrush.
Mua by z g is so incredible and she does.
The full videos on her channel at using.
Airbrush makeup when i was failing so.
Many times i left a comment on her video.
Not like if she was gonna see it or not.
And she literally saw on facetime with.
Me for hours the tv at the proper.
Techniques in showing me what i was.
Doing wrong she even sent over some of.
Her personal colors and machines for me.
To youth to try out for today's video so.
She is literally an angel she saved this.
Video okay you guys i want you to go.
Check out her channel look for their do.
Okay let's get started.
So nobody you guys knows my makeup.
Routine i start off with my foundation.
First and then go on to eyebrows eyes.
And the whole shebang for airbrush.
Makeup we're actually gonna do in the.
Opposite order starting with brows and.
Eyes first because if i mess it up which.
I very well might it'll be easier to.
Clean up instead of how i would be like.
The entire base over about being said.
Let's go ahead and grab our first color.
Which is going to be you know dark brown.
For our brows we're gonna do three drops.
Okay so no see if we could go like this.
There it is with the airbrush you can.
Obviously just like go in and spray it.
Which we'll get you later on but for.
More specific details it comes with a.
Lot of these really cool stencils which.
Help you get like more accurate lines.
And shapes and stuff so i'm gonna grab.
This fun little brow stencil we're just.
Gonna go right in okay there we go.
Okay yes that looks great okay great now.
I'm gonna have to do any arch okay now.
I'm gonna do my tail and this gonna.
Oh okay well i'd like to think that only.
God but also jesus shoot chefs are over.
Starting over.
Attempt number three oh this is so hard.
Perfect oh my god perfect perfect for my.
Boobs that looks cute she's chic she's.
Here she's ready to party you know we're.
Gonna clean off first sense all cuz now.
It's all dirty and we're gonna do what's.
Wrong number two okay so i want to make.
Sure that these are even obviously.
Tonight it's not okay.
I'm happy with them they could of course.
Be a little bit better but after trying.
This for different time i am very happy.
With these these are by far the best.
That i have done and i just want to move.
On that while we have that so we're.
Gonna go ahead and move on to the iris.
Of a portion already kind of followed me.
Right okay i really stated for the i've.
Set of courses because the last few.
Times that i've tried this it wasn't the.
Skin that i was messing up on i actually.
Really enjoyed it it was the eye shadow.
Portions because i literally could not.
Get the colors too later on and they are.
Melting they were getting in my eyeballs.
And my contacts it was not good but i.
Picked up a lot of different techniques.
From ziya that i'm gonna try out today.
So hopefully this will work a whole lot.
Better so i'm gonna hold my stencil back.
Up to my skin at once again because i.
Don't want to get any of this color on.
My actual brow that we just you know.
We're so hard on but i was gonna go.
Ahead and spray this nice vanilla color.
On my brow bone to brighten it up oh.
This excitement probably seems so lame.
But you guys after trying this so many.
Times on the other eye of all perfect.
Two layers a little bit on my actual.
Eyelids as well.
I really bane the eyelids at almost like.
Dark areas right in this inner corner.
For some reason so putting on a light.
Wash will just kind of neutralize that.
So for my look today i want to do.
Something a pretty it but nothing too.
Colorful because if that takes a lot of.
Practice i'm actually gonna grab this.
Nice little shimmery bronze shade first.
To go my lid very weird i'm gonna use.
Stencil just to avoid getting it on my.
Face well they're pretty okay there we.
Go you guys know that i always do while.
I'm cara then while i off you can't work.
That way with every bus either you have.
To do both eyes at the same time to keep.
Your colors consistent to not have to.
Clean the gada a million times so you're.
In for a treat today same thing on this.
I wall so for our next color we're now.
Going to grab a burnt orange shade so.
We're gonna do our crease color now this.
Order so strange and this we're gonna be.
Very careful with because we need to.
Layer this up it's gonna start layering.
This in the outer corner and then just.
Pulling this shade up into the crease.
Pretty good like even so far this is.
Looking good okay then i want to darken.
Up my upper corner a little bit so i'm.
Gonna grab it summit dark brown and i'm.
Gonna add in a few drops into the.
Machine and then i'm just going to.
What's called a back bubbling press it.
In there and then mix the colors.
Together some nice bubbling happening in.
There okay layer this into the outer v.
This is a million times more fun than.
Regular eyeshadow are you kidding.
So now i'm gonna go back in with a.
Little bit more of my orange color just.
To bring something with that well this.
Is really giving it to me right now wer.
This is like everything that i needed.
Anymore she on the other hand is that's.
How my feelings i want to add back a.
Little bit of that shimmery color since.
It got lost in the blending this is.
What's good about airbrushed shoes that.
You can layer everything together.
That's pretty oh wow that's so excited.
Alright you guys so now we get to the.
Part of this look that could very well.
Ruin act or title together and that is.
Going to be the eyeliner now if you are.
Like me you're probably thinking how are.
You gonna do.
With everybody and you know i'm gonna.
Show you i thought that this would have.
Never been possible but then i saw.
Everybody's video where she just you.
Know went right in surprisingly you can.
Actually get a barry do you tell mine.
With this we're still gonna use our.
Since all this out and pray that this is.
Not what takes us down because we do so.
Good so farms are in the middle of the.
Lid oh my god and then for this area.
We're going to continue with the same.
Shape that we've been doing and we're.
Going to use this to darken up very.
Lightly oh my god i light up with.
Airbrush who would have thought it would.
Be possible not me i'll take that right.
Now let's try this again on the other.
Eye perfect i think i'm happy without i.
Don't think i want to go any further.
Okay great so that is converse the eye.
Shadow portion of this look all complete.
Of course we can add on the brow bone.
Highlight and lashes a little bit later.
On to look just because i don't want to.
Mess anything up but before we go on to.
The foundation i'm gonna quickly take.
Just a makeup wipe and we're gonna clean.
Up this bottom edge that looks gorgeous.
Okay same thing on the side i know that.
I was getting so excited and literally.
Screaming throughout this entire portion.
But after so when he tries okay it feels.
Really good to just get something that.
Actually looks presentable on the eyes i.
Feel like i'm finally succeeding at this.
Makeup challenge and now it is time to.
Move on to our next step which is going.
To be a foundation and so it should be a.
Little bit of smoother sailing from here.
On all right so now it is time for our.
Foundation and i have two colors here.
That i'm going to mix together.
Foundation is definitely what i'm most.
Excited about and also like what.
Airbrush makeup is kind of most commonly.
Used for especially with like weddings.
Because obviously your toes to look like.
Airbrush and it's just like looks.
Flawless all blended together so i'm.
Really pumped for this stop i'm gonna.
Grab one of my straight edge stencils so.
I can do this portion if i have a shoe.
That actually messing up any of the work.
That we just did well i really really am.
Obsessed with how this covered look it's.
Very much like your skin but better type.
Of on deal you can still see my freckles.
And beauty marks poking through which.
Personally i.
Love like 23 foundation with airbrush.
All the time are you kidding.
Okay let's doing that too okay i think.
It's done.
Not as time to contour i'm gonna grab a.
Few drops of this clock called hazelnuts.
Zis a way to hold this really a really.
Far away what i'm going to do that's a.
Little bit dark oh okay why is wow this.
Is my bad type and this one's coming out.
So much better today.
Okay okay little harsh oh god this bout.
Looks bad we're gonna layer some.
Foundation back over top of that it's.
Just looks gray now what i do.
Should i just wipe off this area though.
Okay that definitely helped oh wow.
Well no way liners gray though once.
Again i'm gonna cut cameras for a minute.
Get back to where i was then we're gonna.
Recontour i'll be back okay hello when.
You're back i touched up the foundation.
Got the eyeliner back to where it wise.
We're just how to contour it once again.
And this time we're gonna literally hold.
This 8,000 miles away okay that's not.
That bad i think with bronzer and blush.
Over top of a no look it'll like come.
Together now decide for blush i'm really.
Hoping that this will like pull together.
At the contour a little bit i'm gonna.
Start on my right hand side which.
Apparently today is a better side that.
Looks yellow now to this side oh forgot.
Your nose contour that's scary.
My big ass nose okay i'm just coming i.
Can't even listen that okay no nose.
Contour.
On the highlight let's go this is the.
Final stretch you guys we're doing good.
Let me out a little bit on the brow.
Bones should i try to do my inner.
Corners or is that like risking it.
That's good okay oh my god oh my god you.
Guys well i think at this point we can.
Turn off our airbrush machine because.
We're dying but we do have two long.
Steps to do which is going to be it just.
Of course the eyelashes and then.
All right you guys we'll finally after.
Three attempts it looks like four times.
Is the charm four wines because that is.
A fullface using only airbrush makeup.
All complete i am incredibly happy and.
Proud with how this look turned out.
Today it is not perfect in any way shape.
Or form okay i'm not claiming it to me.
But in comparison to the other three.
Times that i film is okay this looks.
Amazing and i am so so happy with it i.
Want to say it once again a major major.
