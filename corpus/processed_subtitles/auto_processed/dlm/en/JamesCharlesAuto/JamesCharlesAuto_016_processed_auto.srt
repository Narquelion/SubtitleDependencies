Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel.
Cutting straight to the point.
Hello everybody we are back and we are.
Sitting down for episode two of this.
Mini makeover series.
If you have not yet checked out episode.
One which is last week's video this mini.
Makeover series make sure to click up.
Here or up here i'm not sure what side.
It's on where we got my makeup done at.
Sephora it was so much fun for today's.
Video we're going to be going to match.
To get the same full glam makeover i.
Made my appointment and we're gonna be.
Heading out in a few minutes but before.
We do that i definitely wanna make a few.
Quick disclaimers because some people.
Majorly missed the point of last week's.
Video and this entire series while a lot.
Of you guys definitely loved the first.
Makeover video if there was a lot of.
People that misinterpreted the point of.
The video first of all i can't even.
Reiterate how many times i've said it.
Throughout the video but apparently.
Y'all's ears were closed the artists in.
The video asked for word did such an.
Amazing job i'm gonna leave the artists.
Instagram right here her name is crystal.
Marine go like her last post and go.
Comment saying sister james sent you and.
Show her the love because she did such.
An amazing job and i don't know why so.
Many people were thinking that the point.
Of the video was for me to shine on her.
Because it was not during prom season of.
All season event season and wedding.
Season so many people go to these.
Various different stores and get their.
Makeup done in order to feel beautiful.
And confident on their special day at.
The end of each makeover we're gonna.
Come right back here i'm going to show.
You guys the finished look and then.
We're going to talk about it every.
Different makeup store trains their.
Artists in different ways and every.
Artist has different styles and.
Techniques that they do makeup in which.
Is why i think that this series is such.
A cool and fun idea to be able to.
Showcase different artists different.
Styles and different techniques and then.
How they may differ from my very own.
That you guys get to see all the time.
Obviously i'm not gonna like everything.
That they do on me and if i was to do.
The makeup on them i'm sure they would.
Not like everything that i was gonna do.
On them either and that is totally okay.
I'm not gonna sit here and drag any.
Artists because the whole point of.
Getting your makeup done is to have a.
Different style than your own which is.
The whole fun behind it but i will talk.
About things that i would have done.
Differently or preferred so therefore.
You guys are watching me from makeup.
Tips can get a rough idea of what your.
Makeup or experience may be like if you.
Want to get your glam done at one of.
These places so you can make it more.
Educated decision next time you have a.
Special event to go to and finally.
Before we get this video started the.
Last thing i want to address is the.
Comment about me of being treated like a.
Normal customer at sephora i want to be.
Able to give you guys an accurate.
Rotation of what a normal makeover at.
One of these stores may look like but.
That can sometimes do you really really.
Hard when the employees know who you are.
There have definitely been times in the.
Past where i've walked into various.
Different makeup stores and have been.
Greeted with special treatment i've seen.
A lot of different products before they.
Actually hit the shelves i've gotten.
Products that were supposed to be out of.
Stock and i've also gotten different.
Things for free because of my name i do.
Want to apologize if i came out as.
Entitled or conceited in the last video.
I definitely missed the mark on what i.
Wanted to say so i'm very very sorry for.
That i do not think of myself as any.
Higher than any other artist i'm just a.
Normal html kid with a few blending.
Brushes like my instagram bio says but i.
Did want to address that because it has.
Happened in the past it's just the.
Reality of the situation it's really not.
That deep all about being sent though.
There is no denying that i have worked.
My ass off to become a name in this.
Industry if you hate me if you hate my.
Videos if you hate the way i do my.
Makeup if you hate the way i talk that's.
Totally fine but word of advice stop.
Watching my videos stop commenting and.
Stop talking about me because you're the.
Ones keeping me relevant on that.
Trending page i'm alright that is.
Everything i have to say i hope that.
Cleared everything up and without.
Further ado let's head over to mac and.
Get our damn makeup done alright guys so.
We are back home from our mac make over.
My appointment was at 4 o'clock today.
And we just got home and is currently.
601 actually and was about 15 minutes of.
Travel time there and back it was.
Probably about an hour and a half.
Appointment total so it definitely not.
Bad for a full glam make over my artist.
Today was named helen and you can find.
Her an instagram and i heart helen.
Definitely go show her all the love from.
His sisters tell her sister james sent.
You she was so sweet and so nice and.
Just like the last video my artist did.
Not know who i was and one point she.
Asked me if i was a youtuber and i was.
Like yes girl but i only have a small.
Channel which may have been a little bit.
Of apply because all your sisters out.
There know how big we have become we are.
So close to 2 million subscribers so.
Definitely click that subscribe button.
If you have not already but she was so.
Sweet and so nice without further ado.
Let's pull in this mirror and look at.
This makeup a super close-up so before.
We actually went in and started on at.
The glam makeup today i showed my artist.
A picture of two makeup look that i.
Wanted being the same exact one from the.
Last video i'm jacqueline hale it is.
Right here just in case you need a.
Little bit of a reminder but i'm gonna.
Be asking for the.
Same look from all the different places.
That might go i know a lot of you guys.
In the last video we're definitely.
Commenting that it was kind of stupid.
For me to just tell the artist to do.
Whatever they want because as the client.
You are definitely supposed to ask for.
What you want in order for the artist to.
Give it to you which i agree with so.
Once i showed her the photo i clarified.
That i wanted book herbert foundation a.
Lot of glow.
Not too much bronzer and a more snatched.
Nose and she said okay to all those.
Things which i thought was really really.
Great to give her a little bit in board.
Direction based on my personal.
Preferences so therefore the end result.
Won't be judged on personal preference.
Things because a lot of people were.
Really mad about that in the last video.
Don't worry i got you.
So the first thing that she did was.
Start off with priming my face and she.
Actually used a mac of bb cream which is.
Saying that i've never seen done before.
She said it was a light and sticky base.
To make the skin a more natural and even.
Off the route for the foundation process.
Later on she next one into my brows.
Using a mac brow pencil and i honestly.
Really really like how the brows turned.
Out i felt like she added a really.
Really nice perk she definitely did not.
Make them too thick and i definitely.
Love love love all the love that she.
Defined the tail and pulled it out as.
Well as many of you guys know i've.
Recently been try to make my tails more.
Out as opposed to more down which allows.
For a lot more eyeshadow shape these.
Furrows are definitely a huge win in my.
Book next was the eyes then she first.
Started off by priming them using the.
Mac painterly paint-pot.
Which is a paint pot that like literally.
Every beauty guru in the entire world.
Uses except for me for some reason.
I have no vendetta against it i just.
Have never actually gotten around to.
Buying one but she used it today and i.
Think it worked beautifully as a.
Eyeshadow base i really do plan on.
Trying it out eventually i sort of go.
Ahead and then for the eye shadows today.
She used the mac single shadows in the.
Shade soft and gentle brown script i'm.
Into it swiss chocolate sweet heat and.
Nylon and this my look is really really.
Good looking at the eye shadow close-up.
I am so so chef this honestly looks.
Really really good as you guys can see.
There was a really really smooth and.
Even transition between of course the.
Problem highly the transition shade the.
Deeper shade in the crease the darker.
Shade in the outer corner and then even.
There's a smooth transition between the.
Metallic shade on the lid which is so so.
Well done she even went ahead and added.
A black winged liner to this look i'm.
Actually not even sure if jacqueline has.
A wing on in the original photo you.
Really can't tell based on the angle.
That her face and.
Is that but she went ahead and out of it.
Anyway and this liner is so good too.
She used a gel liner which i was really.
Really spooked about when she pulled it.
Out because doing a really really even.
And tiny precise winged liner with a gel.
Is not the easiest thing in the world.
But she absolutely slated this liner.
It's ready to cut a    that is for.
Sure on the lower waterline she lines.
That using a block i call it and then.
Blend it out using the brown script.
Eyeshadow i believe i don't think once.
Again in the photo of jacqueline she has.
Black in her water line but it.
Definitely is a very very smoky look and.
I really really love how this turned on.
As well i actually think i prefer this.
Over the light water line i haven't done.
Black in the water line for a smoky look.
In the longest time ever but honestly i.
Really really missed this because it.
Makes my eyes well my contacts pop so so.
Much when it came to the lashes once.
Again i did ask for falsies and i didn't.
Catch the name of these ones.
Unfortunately but they were mac branded.
And i was really really spooked because.
They were like the original size and i.
Was like girl my eyes are very very tiny.
I usually cut a lot off the lashes and.
She measured him and she's like oh.
You're fine and i was like woah okay but.
She actually glued on the full band and.
She glued them on so well i don't know.
What she did i don't know what she used.
But i need her to glue my lashes.
Everyday because they looked so good i.
Literally cannot feel them either and i.
Have no idea like how this is even going.
On the way eyes right now but i'm not.
Even gonna ask questions i'm just gonna.
Appreciate the thought that somebody was.
Able to glue and a full eyelash onto my.
Eyelid and it feels amazing after the.
Eyes came the base makeup and like i.
Told you guys i definitely did ask for a.
Fall carmen foundation scioscia end of.
The studio fix fluid foundation which is.
Definitely full coverage if you are.
Familiar with mac products and she mix.
Together the shades nw 13 and c 4 and i.
Think that this is one of the best.
Foundation not just i have ever had in.
My entire life she then went ahead and.
Used the lightest shade in the mac pro.
Conceal palette to highlight under my.
Eyes and in the center of the forehead.
And she actually blended out this entire.
Look using one of those triangular throw.
Out beauty sponges which i was so so.
Surprised and impressed by obviously at.
Places like sephora or alter you're.
Gonna have beauty blenders but obviously.
Mac it does not have those so i was so.
Impressed that she somehow managed to.
Get such an even and go to blend using.
Those tiny-ass drugstore sponges so once.
The foundation and concealer were all on.
And blended out she went ahead and set.
My face using the mac prep.
Powder which i will say is not my.
Favorite looking closely at lumiere it.
Definitely is starting to wear down a.
Little bit under my eyes as you can see.
There's some creases up in this region.
And then also around the mouth and if i.
Touch my face it is a little bit tacky.
This is totally personal preference but.
I do wish she would have applied a.
Little bit more powder to my face to.
Really lock it in place and make sure it.
Stayed all night long because if i was.
Wearing this out i feel like i.
Definitely would start to sweat the.
Makeup off a little bit.
Next it was hard to contour my face and.
Once she was doing it i couldn't help.
But wonder what she was using because i.
Had never seen it before.
It was there blotting powder in the.
Darkest shade when i asked she told me.
Was because it was a cool tone shade.
Which really obviously helps to sculpt.
The face but it doesn't really have that.
Much covered so it allows for a really.
Really light and blended out contour.
That looks almost natural and girl when.
She told me that i was so shocked.
Because i did such a good idea.
And as you can see it this contour looks.
Amazing she then used that same a dark.
Blotting powder to contour my nose which.
I was so excited about obviously in the.
Last video my nose looked a little bit.
Big because i did not ask her to be.
Contoured but when i asked this time she.
Was very very happy too can we i.
Snatched nose looking at in the mirror i.
Do wish she would have pulled the lines.
A little bit closer together to make it.
More and more snatched appearance but.
That's totally personal preference and.
When she was highlighting she did use.
That tiny pencil brush like i always do.
To draw a very very thin lie i know the.
Highlighter looks a little bit bigger.
Now but that's a sweat and oil mountain.
Highlighter i promised it looked really.
Good at the time once the contour was.
All on and nice and slayed she went into.
The blush and for today's look she's the.
Mac blush in the shade peaches and i was.
Literally so so excited to see her pull.
It out i said not asked for i did not.
Request it but as many of you guys know.
That is literally my favorite blush and.
The only blush that i ever wear in my.
Looks it is such a beautiful warm tone.
Peachy orange shade that i absolutely.
Love and she was so shook and she told.
Me that it was one of her favorites as.
Well and i thought it paired perfectly.
With this look so next came the glow and.
She was the mac highlighter in the shade.
Soft and gentle which made my heart so.
So warm because that's actually the.
First highlighter that i ever ever used.
On myself i used to use that same eye.
Harder every single damn day for every.
Look that i ever did because i could not.
Afford to buy another one so it has a.
Very very special place in my heart and.
It is still to this day one of my.
All-time favorite highlighter shades.
Looking at my face in the mirror i will.
Say that she definitely stuck by the.
Name of the.
Later being soft and gentle it.
Definitely is a subtle like glowing from.
Within type of look and based on the.
Picture with jacqueline you can.
Definitely see that her highlight is.
Blinding and you guys know i love a.
Blinding harley as well so i will say.
That i wished she applied a little bit.
More highlighter last certainly not.
Least she went and did my lip study.
Using the matte burgundy lip liner and.
Then filled them and using the.
Carnivorous liquid lipstick looking at.
My entire face i think that the lips are.
Probably my least favorite part of this.
Look today i do like the color that she.
Chose i feel as though it is a pretty.
Close match to that original picture.
That jacqueline wore but i'm not the.
Biggest fan of the shape before she went.
Started my lips i did tell her that i do.
Like my top lip a little bit over life.
It is one of my favorite things to do my.
Makeup techniques especially because i.
Feel like my lips are a little bit.
Uneven so over lining them allows me to.
Get a really really even and perfect lip.
Shape but when she applied it i feel.
Like she actually underlined my lips a.
Little bit you can almost get a tiny.
Little border surrounding almost the.
Entire lips of where there is lips but.
No actual makeup product which is.
Definitely not my favorite thing in the.
Entire world this is the finished look.
And i honestly it was love how it turned.
Out i am so chuck in a good way.
That's for sure going into box today all.
The employees were so so nice and my.
Artist like i said helen was so kind so.
Sweet very very comforting and also.
Really really talented as you guys can.
See she's only that she didn't working.
It back for the last ten years which i.
Was so so impressed by and as you can.
See her skill level and experience.
Definitely reflects back in the makeup.
Thinking about my full experience today.
At mac and looking at my makeup in the.
Mirror i would rate today's makeover a 9.
Out of 10 the only two things that.
Really docked points today like i.
Excited to be the setting partner i do.
Wish she applied a little bit more.
Essentially like around my smile lines.
Under my eyes because i am definitely.
Getting a few creases and there and i do.
Feel a little bit oily and also the lips.
I do wish you would have lined them a.
Little bit more to over line them or at.
Least even follow my natural lip line i.
Feel as though they are a little bit.
Underlying which isn't the most.
Flattering for my face but neither one.
Of these two things are deal-breakers.
And this makeover was so successful in.
My eyes at least alright guys and that.
