School and i've just never really.
Thought they need to but that being said.
Today that is how i never that's not all.
I never went to a party i know all the.
Time did you ever think that i was going.
Out with friends and was lying to you.
About where i was no i always knew that.

Time to tell you if i never did go out.
But i actually do that i know i believe.
