Questions about your job so the viewers.
At home know about like how i grew up.
With you and i was like what their job.
Entails so you are a contractor and.
You're self-employed business and how.
Like to be a hard worker why do you work.
For yourself why do you think i like.
Trickle down to people i like working.
For myself because it you're gonna work.
That hard and as as much as i do it's.
Far more beneficial for me.
Do you think because.
That way and they cut yourself and.
Played still do you think that had a lot.
To do with why you and mom or so lenient.
Let me do what i do was frightening to.
Be honest with you my mom and dad really.
Had no idea as to what when you were.
Doing it and more importantly how you.
Could actually turn it into a job but.
You were always a hard worker but there.
Are always multi tasking you always say.
All right you to do it little cribs.
Hopefully going to take this up i'm.
Thinking like mtv cribs tour hey yo mtv.
And i'm gonna give you a nice space so.
Where does the bathroom are gonna be.
Demolish a as you can see low few leaks.
So good thing i have a good they have a.
Hard time as i was just saying yes a.
Nice popcorn feature on the ceiling that.
We may or not be removing eventually.
Some blue walls all throughout so we.
Have a vanity sink a navy blue cab what.
Do you call them the bottom portion of.
The bottom version of the sink has some.
Nice navy blue cabinets we have a mirror.
And then this light that looks like it's.
From 1854 on the mirror so we're going.
To get rid of that over here we have a.
Shower as well that's about their tour.
This is what it's like now so get ready.
To see it not look like this.
First thing you had to do is turn off.
The water use a valve back there it goes.
Yeah yeah yeah righty-tighty now you.
Want to pick up the seat flush the.
Toilet this comes off and any residual.
Water in the tank you got to drop that.
Old sponge in there soaked up as much.
Water as you can out of the tank.
Happy t10 what is this thing that's the.
Plunger you can break that just pull it.
Up and snap it off because it's going.
Out it's garbage now lift up the seat in.
Your hand lift up the seat oh now that.
Water has to come out of there and go.
Into the bucket don't pull over the top.
Of your glass it's clean water it's just.
In the toilet bowl.
Music.
All right don't you dad we're gonna need.
That now take this this is one or.
Absorbing crystals so any residual water.
That's left in there it's the same same.
Product that is they treat the inside of.
Diapers pampers with an income walk-down.
Itself all right now we gotta take two.
Bulbs which are these down here we even.
Open up your tool pouch oh yeah i have.
Tools for you it should spin free now we.
Can pull the toilet bowl okay this piece.
Of cardboard because there's a wax ring.
Underneath and the wax ring is what.
Directly comes in contact with all the.
Human waste bodily waste okay okay.
Pick up multiple flanges on there that's.
Why i'm going to sit flat that's the.
First put a lot of wax on the bottom.
There's a lot of wax around there and.
All of this just remove the toilet bowl.
Your first tour lever normally i would.
Just carry that down in one piece but.
You're not gonna be able to do that.
