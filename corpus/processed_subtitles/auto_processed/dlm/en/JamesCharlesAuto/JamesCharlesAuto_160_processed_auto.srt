Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my you to tale or should.
I say good morning sisters as you can.
See i'm looking a little bit different i.
Literally just woke up i look like i got.
Hit by a bus i'm right here and this is.
A studio because i have a very very fun.
And fresh video for you guys today.
Some of my most requested videos of all.
Time have na a morning routine you guys.
Always asked for that a skincare routine.
I'm really not sure why when my skin is.
Looking as super problematic oh haze and.
Also a how i do my hair routine which.
Also comes as a shock to me considering.
It looks like a rat's nest half the time.
But i figured why not kind of like merge.
Them all into one i just woke up it is.
Super early in the morning i have a lot.
To do today i have to be on set in a few.
Hours i have a bunch of meetings and i.
Have a dinner to go to later on tonight.
I do not have time to get fully glammed.
This morning but i do want to get ready.
And still look super super cute so i.
Figured for today's video i would take.
You guys to my morning routine and show.
You guys how i actually get ready in the.
Morning and go from looking like this to.
Actually kind of low-key a little bit.
Good look at him without actually my.
Full glam makeup process so if you guys.
Are interested in that keep on watching.
Music.
All right sisters rise and shine and.
Give god his the csd i can't fail.
I just don't mind put on a quick little.
Cute a sister's elfin without the.
Sisters dr. carol calm but the person.
That was doing the morning is coming.
Right into that master contacts if you.
Guys want to be on snapchat you know.
That i wear glasses on an everyday basis.
Because a sister cannot see to say as.
Life but ren glasses with makeup is a.
Little bit problematic since it always.
Leaves those annoying little lines right.
There so i do like to pop in my colored.
Contacts by the way for those you guys.
Who always ask my contacts are from.
Desio and i also saw that every morning.
That brushing my teeth just every person.
Should plain brush water and toothpaste.
What are you talking about i never wet.
At first so normally now i would hop.
Right into the shower and get ciserek.
Squeaky clean i personally am a grenade.
Shower i have a lot of trouble getting.
Up in the morning so a shower really.
Helps me awaken and get ready for the.
Day i know some people into shower at.
Night personal preference please don't.
Attack me but for today i actually do.
Have a haircut appointment schedules.
We're gonna have it right downstairs for.
Me my hair is like very very important i.
Don't know why but i always just have a.
Lot of insecurities on my hair growing.
Up as a kid i think probably one too.
Many.
Mortifying haircuts that maybe look even.
I'm clear that i already well it's.
Grayed out so now i'm here in la and i'm.
So willing to eat my hair super super.
Clean it looks better in photos looks.
Better on video and i just feel a lot.
More pop it with a fresh feed and a good.
Updo so let's head out our instances.
Were here with a sister sophia living at.
Legenda.
Harel quia something's been cutting my.
Hair an offer probably it's got over a.
Mere four cents downtown we have a.
One-year anniversary coming up welcome.
For us which is literally one of the.
Most haunted rubbers in the entire world.
And she happens to be a kept woman.
Clearly which i now love something's.
Responsible for up might really been.
Impressed paid so we're going to get.
Sister stats today so i could be a.
Confident and get ready for the day okay.
Sister sophia just finished cutting my.
Hair she has to run to her next.
Appointment she has i had crazy by the.
Day ahead of her just like we do is i.
Didn't get a chance to say it goodbye.
But literally i'm so scared of how.
Goodbye her let's get out like are you.
Literally kidding me i feel already a.
Million percent better and ready to take.
On the day but we still touchdown.
Because i probably smell gross and i.
Want to get everything else done and.
Clean so let's head upstairs.
Music.
Okay those videos get do monetize.
Seating up i'm giving a lot of questions.
About bathing suits we have four shorts.
And also one piece bikini queen very.
Brief signatures two sisters apparel.
Look over that for the sister summertime.
Party right i just know the longer this.
Completes heating up the first thing.
That i'm gonna do is actually part one.
Of my skincare routine i'm gonna relay.
It's anita lemon cream a cleanser this.
Is like a really neat on one gosh my.
Skin i'm gonna go to translate a lot my.
Guns to really scrub it up a little bit.
Bigger than on the first ride i'm used.
To it drop off my facial cleanser.
Because this also acts i had been.
Exfolia highway security that 2008 book.
And.
A kind of cycle simply wilfer girls what.
My heart rates up it's all black i love.
The brand of the spice and i love a.
Second as well so it's maybe just a port.
In trouble i do a little bit more point.
Leadership i don't wash it every day but.
The kind of the exam is very texture and.
All of all when you're doing with each.
Other for rumps ought to have it sounded.
Like having a little bit of like wear in.
Your hair it grows enough sounds update.
The style a whole i don't watch that.
Make sure that make sure you're getting.
Stains amharic sprays everywhere so that.
Foxes once i hear it all clean of course.
We plumb up to you it was my body if box.
Before engine i do once here so if you.
Guys go on.
Music.
Music.
Music.
Music.
Music.
Did you missy i did all my shower and my.
Little sister tina three weeks this is.
The parallel bathrobes just thought of.
That right now.
Kind of an approach to these sisters we.
Clean your sister by dyson hair dryer.
Novice at this hair dryer is probably.
The most ridiculously prices are in the.
Entire world being sold at a whopping.
$400.
You can't use hoji mr. prasad either but.
What i tell you this is also literally.
The best hair during the entire rolls.
I'm not kidding i mean i really wish i.
Was being paid to tell you that but i.
Can't deny the back so i have two.
Different tell.
First always put on this one i think.
This car drivers thank god i have a.
Hairdryer and i have a little rounder.
Brush so i basically just like go to my.
Hair i'm explaining this now consider.
Loud i'm going to go through my hair.
Brushing forwards in circular motions.
And going forward so kind of like makes.
The her leg do not even saying does this.
Make sense.
Very jimmy neutron forgot jimmy neutron.
Moment but then we're gonna on the.
Bacon a little messy.
Music.
Now i'm going to go buy a mini a.
Straining all right and i'm going to.
Switch it on i believe this one is from.
Sephora so far she doesn't make it fun.
Anymore i'm not sure why because it's.
Really bomb but they do sell solution.
Here one of the least right aaron is how.
I'm gonna do the same exact thing that i.
Do with the hairdryer which is basically.
Just grabbing little sections one at a.
Time holding my very slowly and pulling.
It down and forward into a little curl.
So beautiful now we don't do that so.
Literally my entire what most of my hair.
It takes i know a lot of work to make it.
Look like i did no work if that makes.
Any sense but then surely the type of.
Look that i don't like to go for i'm not.
Going to grab my way not pomade but it's.
Going to rub it together in my hand so.
Kind of warms up a little bit and gets a.
Little bit more soft as my basically.
Just went like rub it in to my head i.
Definitely to focus most of it in the.
Front of my hair just so making these.
Pieces kind of come down and get texture.
See how it's like nice and like funky.
Like that and then i put the excess cut.
It in the back and then going to grab my.
Way of texturizing hairspray there is no.
Way that i could do any original out.
This basically we're supposed to take a.
Little bit of this i'll see a lot of it.
I'm kind of like you think bigger swing.
Open up my hair so kind of how my hair.
You like to kind of keep it this way i'm.
Gonna grab my last product which is de.
Got to be glued paris.
Okay if you know this is my hair routine.
Complete finally our last step before we.
Head out of the bathroom back to it the.
Makeup studio without my skincare.
Routine now of course you might not my.
Step one before we got into the shower.
With these the venus lemon cream a.
Cleanser and i'm just going to grab my.
Next up which is decent he doesn't bite.
A minute to you sorry on i do have like.
Normal skin but i do get very very dry.
Actually it might be your area when i.
Get my laser treatments so i love using.
This after my cleanser after the shower.
Just to get my skin a nice refresh the.
Vitamin c and hydration and it also.
Finally not lisa following the vitamin c.
Sarah what i always like to apply a.
Little bit of moisturizer to really lock.
Everything in place and to complete the.
Routine this is the touch-up do we skin.
Cream pro tip if you're someone like me.
That has of nails.
Just use your knuckle it's done super.
Hard to get in there all gross so soft.
Looking at so doing hydrogen i am.
Obsessed with this i know that's super.
Super short i given everybody asked for.
A skincare routine.
There was talking like 100 million.
Products but i actually believe in.
Quality over quantity though for about a.
Million times on this channel but yeah.
Those are like these four to five.
Products that i use every single day.
That really have worked great alright so.
You're almost there i'm going to quickly.
Head into it the closet put on the.
Hoodie and a parent.
And then i will see you in the sister.
Studio for a quick little no makeup get.
Rid of me.
You're not already sisters so we are.
Back in the studio that you guys all.
Know and love and recognize from all of.
Our videos but today we are not going to.
Be doing a full glam routine this is.
Everyone took me like five minutes total.
Super easy in the morning starting off.
With my base i really did not want any.
Coverage at all but i do have a few.
Spots that i would like to correct just.
A little bit my beard area is obviously.
A little bit great and for some reason.
Around my lips gets very very like.
Orange right here i don't know why and.
Of course if we all have a little bit of.
Under eyes and a few blemishes here and.
There so what i'm going to do is grab.
Just a tiny little bit more of my oyster.
Iser doesn't matter which one you are.
Using and putting it on the back of my.
Hand just like that and then describing.
Literally why not squirt of my favorite.
Foundation that this is the too faced.
Born this way which you guys know i love.
In the shade nude which is like my.
Closest actual color match usually i go.
A little bit more yellow or a little bit.
Darker this is like as close as we're.
Gonna get and just put that right on top.
Of the moisturizer just like dots that's.
Going to mix them together with my.
Finger on the back of my hand and mixing.
It together the moisturizer is really.
Going to sheer it out there's gonna do a.
Little bit down here on the mustache.
Area on the sideburns i'm just gonna.
Take a foundation brush and stipple that.
And and then just super quick with a.
Small powder brush this is the m-52 for.
From morphe who's gonna dip into a.
Little bit of the laura mercier powder.
And just put this right in some areas.
That normally tend to a crease even.
Though we literally have it nothing on.
It this is kind of just like a pro.
Vanity of it just in case any creasing.
Does decide to show up same thing with.
The cylons.
Once the skin is looking beautiful and.
Smooth the next i'm gonna do is my.
Eyebrows it's super quickly even on my.
No makeup days i do always like my brows.
To look it's super super snatched i.
Truly believe the brows afraid in the.
Face and obviously you guys know what.
They look like before so i definitely.
Give them very very on fleek squinter.
Got my anasazi a number 12 brush and a.
Little bit of a dip brow just going to.
Brush the hairs upwards but i'm doing my.
Boy brows i always it start off with the.
Tail because the tail is kind of the.
Only part that i like to be actually.
Defined just catching that.
Bringing that up but i'm doing my no.
Makeup at brows look i really try hard.
To not have to play that with a.
Concealer because that's when it really.
Starts looking like faux glam makeup so.
I'm definitely very very careful during.
These steps to showing in a tiny little.
Hairlike strokes and i almost make them.
Look like.
Bushier then they really are definitely.
Not to the point of like what my 2016.
Brows used to look like but like i don't.
Want them to look as tame as they are.
When i'm glam does this make any sense.
At all basically i'm going for a very.
Rugged mask look try a little hairs.
Little crisscross motions in the.
Directions if they grow and i like that.
That's a good there we go that's good.
That is such a good brow oh i'm so happy.
With that yeah okay okay great first.
Shot i say you're okay no it's gonna do.
The same thing on the other eyebrows.
What's amazing about this too is that.
Since i have literally nothing on my.
Face if i make a mistake all i have to.
Do is just go like that and rub it off.
Whereas before we have makeup wipes.
Concealer setting powder and a whole lot.
Of other things to worry about when it.
Comes to fixing now just to lock those.
Hairs in place i'm gonna grab the.
Anasazi a dip brow gel in the shade and.
Medium and brown this is pigmented so.
I'm gonna go pretty light with it i'm.
Just gonna go in and brush these hairs.
Upwards and then once i get to the.
Middle i'm actually gonna pull them kind.
Of against the way they grow and just so.
They kind of left the brows upwards.
Which not only fills in some areas but.
Also creates some more texture if.
Anything does get a little bit messed up.
Of course you can always grab a little.
Concealer brush and a little bit of a.
Foundation and just go right over that.
Area too but i really do avoid doing.
This because it looks a lot better.
Without but they're looking a little too.
Thick today before we move on to the.
Next step well i still have my dip brow.
Gel i want to show you guys a fun little.
Check that i've been doing a lot.
Recently and i'm just going to grab my.
Last curler and start curling my lashes.
I pro my last every single day no matter.
What i truly feel like curled lashes are.
So cute on literally everybody.
Especially when boys have like really.
Really long lashes oh literally it's so.
Hot and they really just open your eyes.
And look so adorable so those are my.
Natural lashes feel a little bit kidding.
Me my lashes used to be it so long but.
From wearing falsies all the time they.
Get ripped out but like still kind of.
Fun kind of rushed but instead of.
Grabbing a regular mascara because.
That's gonna look a little bit too.
Intense or might.
Of days i'm just gonna grab my dip brow.
Gel and i'm going to just kind of brush.
Off any access that may be on the.
Spoolie because they don't want it to be.
Too intense but i'm just going to use a.
Little bit of this and run right through.
It my lashes to give them a slight coat.
And a slight lift and this is just gonna.
Make them look a little bit more intense.
And a little bit more prominent but not.
Like you're wearing a full-on lash which.
I love see it really does make a.
Difference oh my god like it's a slight.
Difference but it's a pretty difference.
Oh look at my lashes look at my lashes.
All right sisters we're almost done one.
Of my favorite things that i like to do.
When i'm not wearing a full glam makeup.
Look is freckles.
I feel like freckles are so beautiful.
They're so youthful they make it look.
Like i am being sunkissed as opposed to.
Sitting inside and working and filming.
All day long and i love how i look in.
Them to do them i always got my anasazi.
At dipper hotel literally once again in.
The shade auburn and i'm just going to.
Grab a small little pencil brush like.
This one this is just the e36 for morphe.
And i go in and i just kind of like.
Wiggle the brush around a little bit.
Just to get some pigment on there and i.
Always go in on the back of my hand and.
Just rub off any excess and then i'll.
Literally just go in and start off with.
The freckle layer but i kind of just.
Like watching this around my cheek.
Region i am going to add a little.
Freckled off in a second but this kind.
Of just lays down a little like.
Sunkissed base area and then grabbing a.
Little liner brush this into e 37 and my.
Two different dip brow shades.
A burn and a medium brown i'm just going.
To add tiny little freckles i'm just.
Using different pressures when applying.
These freckles to some pressing a really.
Really hard and some barely even.
Touching my skin just to kind of create.
Different shapes and colors and sizes.
Because not all freckles are the same.
And i'm just concentrating the most and.
The darkest dots right in this x center.
Nose area and fading them out as they go.
Towards the outside of my face now this.
Is definitely optional but you guys know.
Personally i like to look very very dewy.
And glowy.
So i'm just going to grab the james.
Charles x morphe palette and literally.
The tiniest.
Of face the highlighter shade from the.
Palette and i'm just gonna use it this.
To put a subtle glow on the skin just.
Like that oh gorgeous a little bit on.
The chin and using that excess right.
Above the eyebrows just for some natural.
Radiance inner corners and then last but.
Not least a little bit on the brow bone.
When it comes to highlighting for these.
Looks i actually like to skip out on the.
Nose highlight just because when my face.
Does get oily my nose is always the.
First thing to turn into a kind of slip.
And slide so i'm not gonna put any.
Highlighter on there just to kind of.
Keep it looking at natural give my face.
A quick spritz of the mac's fix+.
In the shade gold white which is like.
It's like shiny fix+ it just has a tiny.
Little bit of shimmer in it which is.
Really going to add to that natural dewy.
Type of look my skin is like absolute.
Glowing and this looks so beautiful.
Right now and last the finally not least.
I'm going to grab a makeup wipe and.
Clean out the back of my hands that i.
Was using as a palette and then just use.
This to go right into my lips and.
Carefully clean up my lip line and last.
But finally not least just to keep my.
Lips hydrated all day long i'm gonna pop.
On a little tiny bit of the fenty beauty.
Of gloss balm i love this gloss and it.
Is very very moisturizing and hydrating.
Which is perfect for this type of look.
Well they love being said it is.
Currently 9 18 in the morning we started.
Filming right around 8 o'clock give or.
Take a few minutes for me a resetting.
The same thing a million times trying to.
Get the perfect take we're done at.
Getting ready for the day that took us.
