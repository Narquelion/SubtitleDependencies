Hi guys it's james charles welcome back.
To my youtube channel i really wanted to.
Film a really fun look this week so i.
Asked you guys on twitter what you.
Wanted to see and almost all of you guys.
Said do a challenge i do and i was so.
Down i've been doing a lot of tutorials.
So i thought it was finally time for me.
To challenge myself and do a challenge.
Video a lot of challenges in one.
Sentence since i just got myself a new.
Pair of very very very pointy stilettos.
I might be a perfect day to put my.
Morphe brushes into retirement for a.
Little while and do the no brushes.
Makeup challenge i decided to be this.
Pinky rose cut crease with the glitter.
Liner and honestly i'm very very proud.
Of how it turned out it was not easy but.
I love the finished look so if you want.
To see her created this using not a.
Single makeup brush make sure to keep on.
Watching i'm gonna start out as always.
Priming my face using my benefit.
Porefessional primer this is totally the.
Easiest step of this tutorial.
Considering i always prime it using my.
Hands anyway we're just what i like to.
Do it.
This is about to go downhill real fast.
So brace yourselves for condition today.
I'm going to use my makeup forever.
Ultra hd foundation stick but i guess.
Since putting it on this way we kind of.
Be like cheating i'm going to rub it.
Into my fingers and then put it on that.
Way oh wow and now i guess we're going.
To start to by the side of my fingers.
Okay okay this could be a lot worse this.
Is not as bad as i was thinking yet.
Knock on wood because we all know that's.
Gonna change in about 15 seconds.
For concealer today i'm going to use my.
Two-faced we're on the suede concealer.
In the shade very fair and i'm just.
Going to tap this in under my eyes and.
All around the face using my own finger.
Once again well is this the first.
Challenge opening up my channel this is.
Not the first challenge i've actually.
Done i haven't tried a lot of the other.
Challenge that i've been floating around.
Youtube but just in my own time they.
Have been very very fun but this one is.
Alarmingly dangerous with the set of.
Nails that i just acquired today i'm.
Going to quickly say under my eyes using.
My code here some powder am at the shade.
Of translucent and once that's packed.
Under the eye just revising over to take.
More about my entire hand and.
Really beat my face to contour my face.
Today i'm going to be using my too faced.
Milk chocolate soleil bronzer oh holy.
Crap i'm feeling extremely patchy right.
Now and it's getting on my last nerves.
But there's something i could really do.
To fix that i guess so i'm going to go.
Ahead and bake my face using my fingers.
Once again in my co2 your thumb powder.
Music.
How many go ahead and let this week for.
A few minutes fingers crossed this.
Contour gets a little bit cleaner.
Because it right now this looks awful so.
I will be right back in a second we can.
Go on the rest of the face all right i'm.
Gonna go ahead and do you guys in so we.
Get started on the eyes to do this.
Problem i'm going to start off by.
Dipping my nail into a nastasia dip brow.
In the shade evany this is where having.
A lot of nails really is coming in handy.
And then to tidy up the bar a little bit.
I'm gonna take some room this way once.
Again on the tip of my finger nail and.
Just go under the brow i need you to.
Stay right there don't move once i have.
The relative loopy and i'm just going to.
Take the remainder of the concealer on.
My finger and blend that in as well as.
Cover my eyelid for my outlets today i.
Decided to do a cut crease i know i just.
Did one recently on my channel but i.
Wanted to do a little bit of a simpler.
One for you guys at home and i know.
Hokies will be super super hard to do.
With just my fingers so i wanted to.
Challenge myself i'm gonna start off by.
Drawing that bottom line of the crease.
Using my fingernail and a cherry cola.
From makeup geek.
And then i'm taking a tiny bit of morphe.
Brick shadow and on my pinky i'm gonna.
Start to blend in that line okay i guess.
That's this ghost we're going to get so.
I'm gonna go back in now with cherry.
Cola once again on the tip of my finger.
Nail and to find that crease line a.
Little bit more this is definitely a.
Challenge to say the least and not as.
Easy as i was expecting getting to like.
Product in the flicks that i wanted to.
Is extremely easy having nails this.
Pointy but actually blending out the.
Product is extremely hard because i.
Really have access to my fingertips.
Because um the nails in the way and then.
To finish off the cut crease i'm just.
Going to define it a little bit more.
Using anasazi a beauty mark behind of my.
Brow bone i'm going to mix together the.
Pink and the white shade from the oprah.
Beverly hills highlighter.
Now normally i would go in with some.
Concealer underneath this crease just to.
Really really cut it and make it super.
Sharp but today i'm gonna be doing some.
Glitter liner underneath the crease.
Knives gonna be kind of my cut so i.
Don't even need to worry about it for.
The glitter liner i'm gonna dip my nail.
Into my mehron mixing medium and just.
Draw a thin line right under the.
Concrete and then dipping right into eye.
Candy glitter in a double bubble i'm.
Gonna press that glitter right into the.
Adhesive well i guess now we're going to.
Try to do a wing i am immediately.
Regretting this and i haven't even.
Started yet but i'm going to dip my.
Fingertip into more via gel liner in the.
Shade in slate and pray.
Holy crap i can't believe i actually.
Just said that okay.
Not the best wing liner but definitely.
Not the worst for my lower lashline oh.
Goodies makeup geek bit and and just.
Quitted by pinkie and smudged out into.
Life oh okay so apparently that didn't.
Work too well so instead i'm going to go.
To the bidding on at the tip of my nail.
And bout that into my lash line i heard.
Like the lower lash line was missing.
Something so i just did my finger back.
Into the mayor of mixing game and into a.
Double bubble and just pop it a little.
Bit on the inner corner her mascara.
Today i'm gonna be using my usual.
Benefit roller lash but since i can't.
Really use the spoolie tie brush i'm.
Going to put some on my finger and then.
Try to apply it that way and pray that i.
Don't get it all over my eye hey this is.
Actually kind of working yes to finish.
Off the eye look i'm gonna pop on at the.
Bottom eyelashes in the style i go home.
I'm gonna go ahead and do the other eye.
Off-camera now i promise i'm so gonna do.
The challenge though this is much more.
Fun than i anticipated it's currently.
00 a.m. but i have to wake up for.
School in like 4 hours.
Lovely so i really need to focus and get.
This done i'll be right back and we can.
Go ahead and finish the face and the.
Rest of the look okay there we go i.
Finished the second i literally 45.
Minutes later but you know what they.
Look good i'm happy with it.
Let's move on the holly my face today.
I'm gonna be mixing together the pink.
And white shades again from the oprah.
Beverly hills high later it's one of my.
Face and you can use code james charles.
For 30% off okay that actually looks not.
Bad at all and lastly to finish off this.
Look i'm going to very very very.
Carefully apply anasazi liquid lipstick.
In the shade it's a girl and there we go.
Guys that completes this no brushes.
Makeup challenge thank you.
All in all i'm really not too happy with.
My skin i don't think i'll be putting on.
My foundation with my fingers anytime.
Again soon but honestly the eyebrows.
Eyes lips and highlighter all really do.
Not look that bad i'm pretty proud of.
Myself for what i was able to achieve.
There definitely some experts out there.
Who did much better than me okay.
Tutorials but i've burned out of myself.
For succeeding and definitely of trying.
