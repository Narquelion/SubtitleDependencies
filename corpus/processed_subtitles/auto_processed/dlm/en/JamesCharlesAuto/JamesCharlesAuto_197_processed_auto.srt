Us how to do our makeup and he's not.
Gonna be able to see us and some other.

Dividing it to say like that because.
They know that he's in a different room.
Okay try again try again well they're.
Gonna see it i'm like 10 seconds anyway.
What textures the wall styrofoam here's.
The cat there's there's gonna be a.
Little divider between us and james and.
So when james is like he has to explain.
It to us he can't touch us or see us yes.
This is probably hard for me because i.
Can definitely man i am a little bit of.
An egotistical person and i definitely.
Like haha i also enjoy helping people.
Too so this is gonna be really hard for.
Me to try to explain this to them.
Without doing it and i probably gonna.
Get really frustrated sister emma what.
Is your experience in makeup oh my god i.
Was a cheerleader and i did like pretty.
Crazy eye shadow for that the girls on.
The team would like make me do their eye.
Shadow because i was like actually kind.
Of good please take that with a grain of.
Salt okay but like i don't think i'm.
Gonna do too bad today.

Of this is to be honest.
All right i promise you and i promise.
Myself i'm not gonna be like oh and and.
Do like oh i don't know how to do makeup.
And make it really because it's funny.
When it's not really funny.
Okay so first we're gonna start off with.
Your foundation so that's gonna be the.
Tan jar that has a black cap to it did.
You find that there's two of those.
Neither of them were jars well it's like.
A circle it's like a longer fit that the.
Long one was emma's shade take you the.
Back of your hand and put like three.
Squirts on there but shake it up first.
Tell me a little bit sister sister.
Separated yeah oh my god she knows.
You're not squirt like three two forests.
Worked on the back of her hand four.
Squirts this thing's running all over.
The place.
Yeah you're gonna need a lot looks a.
Good big goop now use the bigger end of.
The button how am i okay well i was.
Gonna say how am i doing but you can't.
See me no can ozzy so you put on my ear.
Too late it's on it pounce it yes it.
Kind of hurts when i go on my eyeball.
Don't push so hard no they are my actual.
Eyeball what and then make sure you get.
Your neck too and your ears a little.
Orange oh is it the same one that.
Grayson you guys oh yeah this is pretty.
Too tan for you yeah i'm kind of pale.
There should be another shade there what.
Do i do now it's all over my face me.
Over james i'm you use grayson's.
Foundation that's not our problem i put.
The two ones there for you specifically.
You said the tan one not the pale one i.
Said a tan boy aback so you're gonna.
Grab um it's like a tan jar with a black.
Cap on it yeah it's okay no you know we.
Can't have flashback mary flashback mary.
Was she was cute oh okay.
Obviously next was gonna be concealer so.
We have tart shave tape in there you're.
Gonna draw two upside-down triangles on.
Your face so you're gonna go basically.
Right from the inner corner of your eye.
Downward you should have said on your.
Eye before i started drawing it on my.
Face jeans what is on your face.
So you basically want to draw a triangle.
Connecting the inner corner of your eye.
Like are you doing some alumina or.
Anything on my face right now yes that's.
Exactly yet to tell that we are all.
Green socialblade because we're part of.
The illuminati and then bring a little.
Bit of that concealer up to like the.
Side of your nose to a sister snatch naz.
Yeah.
Now i also put a dot right in the center.
Of your forehead above your eyebrows.
Like right in the middle got it okay no.
This is a prank no okay.
Another center here ten who invented.
This.
Can someone me did you really know do.
You feel like around ted so like it's.
Hard for me to find it but yes okay and.
Then like draw a line like underneath.
That like tracing the bottom of your.
Cheekbone all right now time for powder.
You gotta set it blend my eyes into yeah.
You didn't say that okay now you're.
Gonna guard the laura mercier.
Translucent setting powder it's like the.
Bait tub with the cop okay open it up.
And pour a little bit into the cap okay.
This smells kind of good the powder.
Supposedly vanilla yogurt a little bit.
But in a good way and you like i'm gonna.
Going to look like flashback mary i.
Think this is where my downfall is no.
There's a lot of other places that you.
Can fall down later.
Now we're gonna contour so now that.
You're all flat skin tone and you have.
Your concealer on to brighten up the.
Center of your face we need to use.
Contouring to chisel out the outside.
Edges of your face it's nap time.
Yeah let's do it where is this brush.
Jeans it should be it's in there it's a.
It's a bigger brush yeah it's this i.
Can't see it i don't see it angle on a.
Brush it's just it's a like mushroom cat.
Mmm.
Turn to the side and there should be it.
Still really got a slight angle like one.
End to be like taller than the other one.
No some of the brochure should be.
Talking yeah there's more like that but.
It's dark brown you said a light one.
There's another one that's white and it.
Might have like some kind of brown at.
The tip of the brown no sis oh wait yeah.

You put on there the whole thing okay.
Great now we have to contour your nose.
So there's a brush and this is when we.
Snatch up so there's a brush and they're.
Angled a fluffy brush but it's small and.
It has a pink handle and it's dual ended.
Now you're gonna dip into this contra.
Palette again but it's the bottom left.

With concealer y'all ready attacks okay.
I feel like that good sister help you're.
Gonna grab the concealer again and then.
In there there's a brush that has a.
Black handle and it's like a it's a flat.
Like square brush you're gonna define.
Underneath your eyebrow like you know.
How my dough is very sharp yes you do.
Just go right under the brow and they.
Carve it out it's like making like a.
Lime does that make sense or sense okay.
Great wow not be able to see your help.
Is so sister stressful okay how do i.
Like blend that out it's a fluffy brush.
It has the block brussels in like a.
Brownish top mm 335 yes yes yes i'm.
Doing my eyelids right you said yeah put.
A little all the concealer on there.
You've done how often do you do your.
Makeup like this every day usually or.
Every few days whenever i'm filming oh.
Yeah doesn't go round brush in there.
It's like kinda like a dome shape and.
Like it definitely is already dirty with.
Concealer on it all these brushes are.
Doing yes they are but this one is like.
Dirty with concealer on it okay did you.
Find it yeah is it big it's like kind of.
Bad.
It sits in between big and small yes.
Medium medium yes got it.
I'll then use that to pack the powder on.
Top of the eyelid to set everything in.
Place.
If i'd use the powder that's on my shirt.
To pack everything to say to employees.
Humbly i ate a little bit of it and it.
Doesn't taste in my mouth.
Yeah that's pretty good can i eat it if.
You would love to i know i won't love to.
We're all hungry so yeah tastes like.
Vanilla yogurt oh my god that's what.
Grayson's had that's what i said before.
Oh did you just do james overworking me.
He's not feeding me me powder it taste.
So bad triana and you sure you eat it.
Yes sort of god a little bit like ways.
Like gets on your tongue whenever you're.
Blending it it's so good well i mean no.
But anyway oh my god how much you eat.
Aang wait not supposed to eat that much.
So i like do look like flashback mary.
With a little bit of contour right now i.
Think i'm on the right track with some.
Nice little eyebrows they're not that.
Bad anymore they were way worse before.
So feeling really nice and confident and.
Fresh and clean about it and good and.
Good and fresh yeah yeah okay i shadow.
All right what are we feeling um let's.
Just like a warm smoky eye look so grab.
On one of the funky brushes that i gave.
You that has white hairs and probably.
Has a little bit of oil orange on the.
Tap.
Now on the top left-hand side of the.
Palette lives like a mac and cheese type.
Color yes yes dip into that one lightly.
And then you're gonna put that right in.
The crease of your eyelash okay i i kind.
Of know how to do this okay cool.
We'll see how this goes okay cousin what.
Are you doing i'm trying to do my eyelid.
Crease but it's giving me a little.
Trouble i can't get in.
I can't get in the inside of my eye does.
It matter what i only got like the.
Outside half of my eye.
A little bit a fall out but i mean.
That's that's expected right how much.
Are you using i mean not that much but i.
Just also didn't have my brush enough.
Well sister james listen to me you know.
You're on the outside half like you've.
Got outer edge like towards your temple.
Yeah yeah why'd you get on the inside.
Because it's a fed brush that's why it's.
Not that big what are you doing the.
Brush i'm sucking it hitting okay grab.
Another fluffy brush smaller than that.
One.
Okay and i probably should have like a.
Burnt orange shadow on it oh hope that.
Whistle i think so.
Now you're gonna want to dip into it.
It's like a burnt orange there's no yes.
Okay the one next the one on the right.
Of it is no the one on the left of that.
Is the more orange with all the right of.
It when your advisers colorblind we'll.
Just go with this color okay gray and.
You wouldnt want to play tap off the.
Excess because you don't want too much.
To that color and you're gonna want to.
Put that also in your crease but more on.
The outer like the outer half kind of.
Link blend and like as if it was like.
Like a hook like kinda like going from.
The outside of your eyeball - like.
Upwards into the crease like kind of.
Ground a little bit like a drag queen oh.
But like any good way though it should.
Be the same color but you should pack it.
Like right and i'm like the outer area.
Of your eyelid probably did that already.
Well i'm a step ahead of you i'm done.
Okay okay next okay i think so.
Next up is gonna be um the glitter whoa.
Yay sister sparkle oh hey did i why i.
Was really good okay oh where did you.
Cut the crease then we're ready to cut.
The crease okay i love when you're i.
Never cut the crease there's like a.
Rectangular object in there and has a.
Gold cap and it's like how do you.
Remember all this i'm just like thinking.
Right now holy how do you remember all.
This so since we just ordered a pizza.
Right picture like a corner of a pizza i.
Think it's better be the cheesiest thing.
Ever shut up so start from the tear duct.
And go up around dad like towards the.
Middle of your crease and then fill it.
In so the entire inner half of your.
Eyelid is glitter tilt your head back.
And look in the mirror.
So then you have access to it without.
Having to like access to it i've.
Unlocked access to my eyelid how's it.
Look actually not bad like i mean it's.
Not my best work.
This is like the tutorial for somebody.
Who like it's like me.
It's an attainable look you know what.
I'm saying right now it's time for.
Eyeliner i need the support that i want.
To skip don't get that off sad when.
James charles forces you into doing.
Things that you don't want to do excuse.
Me have you ever done a winged liner.
Before no oh okay let's get a nose wire.
Okay so grab it's like a brown stick got.
It it's shimmery it says tom for your on.
It okay there's two ends to it wine it's.
Like a really really tiny point and.
One's like more of like a felt tip.
Marker point got it you want the felt.
Tip side okay so you're gonna start off.
By drawing a line from like a very thin.
Line from the very outer like corner of.
Your eye it should be like thin thin.
Yeah right about that um help think did.
You make it um that's what she said i'm.
When i get nervous i start saying that's.
What she said jokes i could clean that.
Up with concealer though i think.
Basically it's like your boyfriend.
Cheats on you right and you thought he.
Was the man of your dreams he was.
Beautiful he was perfect and then you.
Know a new man comes into your life and.
He's like 30 times hotter not only that.
Listens to the same type of music as you.
Not only that but also i'm not gonna say.
That on james's channel and moral the.
Story is you're now winning right it's.
Like the best rebound you've ever had.
And that is how i'm feeling right now.
With this winged eyeliner except for.
That i am still lonely and single that's.
The difference.
Me that looks good that looks good woah.
Really yeah naughty front of you is.
Where you lose me james why.
Hello yeah i was focusing that step just.
Ruined it for me.
What did you do you ruin down you ruined.
A james i did not what the    ever i.
Just ruined it no kristen i'm so pissed.
Right now.
Why cuz you can ruin my face i just.
Actually ruined my wing blinder i just.
Tell you how to do it so wow.
I'm so pissed right now why cuz i don't.
Want to lose okay so next is gonna be.
Laches do i have to pick these up with.
Tweezers yes now got the mini pair of.
Scissors in there you want to trim off.
Like a tiny little bit on each under the.
Lash got it okay now there's the glue in.
There on it okay now just paint that.
Onto the lash band okay so is the glue.
On there yes okay so you want to like.
Blow on it a little bit so grab it with.
The tweezer okay tilt your head back.
Slightly and put your face i close to.
The mirror and then you want to plop.
Your lash on going from the center of.
Your eye and place it like right on.
There as close to the lash line as.
Possible and then once the center of the.
Lash is like on the center of your.
Eyelid use the tweezers to make sure.
That the outer corner and inner corner.
Are both on your eyelid fully so just.
Take the top okay tape whoa really good.
And you want to put it down as close to.
Your lash line as you possibly can it's.
Like it looks like it's growing out of.
Your lens it's not make sense.
It didn't stick i stuck it right where.
You told me to stay take the lock off.
Okay and then put more glue on there and.
Then blow on it a little bit now like.
We've it around a little bit don't put.
It on right away like wait for it to get.
Tacky and it's so cute how you're.
Focusing so hard on me yeah use it work.
Okay now we're gonna put our mascara on.
The upper and lower you're gonna put it.
On the upper lashes really carefully.
Because if you go on too hard it can.
Pull the wash off so you just kind of.
Want to use that and do it lightly to.
Blend together your real lashes or the.
One's and just kind of brushed them.
Upwards i put my something i am is your.
Crank no i'm a man people leave their.
Mascara all chunky like it's really easy.
Right i don't understand.
Wow okay yeah i'm good.
Okay oh my god james you're gonna hate.
This should i blend out the big now i'm.
So sick of it yeah you can get rid of it.
Now we're done with last chance so fresh.
Wanna grab a big fluffy brush and wipe.
Off the baked powder that's sitting.
There there's a big powder on me.
It should be wait at all did you already.
Wipe it off i blended it in how long ago.
When i first put it on i look at it were.
Supposed to be there that whole time oh.
Is there no powder there anymore no no.
Really.
Oh where'd it go i don't think it was.
Ever there really.
Okay so first you're gonna want to.
Spritz your face with the fix+ like ever.
Something in my flake sister spreads.
Oh no dip the brush into the highlighter.
Okay and put it on the very top of your.
Cheekbones i'm actually like not bad at.
Highlight because i feel like that's the.
Easiest part.
Yeah just like right on the cheekbone.
I'm like right at the top are you.
Glowing for the gods glowing for the god.
Sister what's next okay now there's a.
Little pencil brush in there and four.
Three one yes okay i mean you're gonna.
Dip into the highlighter again okay and.
Then you're gonna use that highlighter.
And you're gonna want to put it right in.
The inner corners of your eyes okay.
Right like under the arch of your.
Eyebrow but below it oh yes i do this -.
Okay great on your brow bone.
Okay show you oh my nose that's my part.
The nose see how i'm a basically told.
Like an exclamation point so like draw a.
Line right down the center of the bridge.
Right in between those two contour lines.
Don't make it too wide or that ruins the.
Illusion and then stock right before the.
Tip and then leave a little space then.
Put a dot right on the tip like to blind.
All the haters 100% sister yeah they.
Give her face like a good spreads.
Chuckles my first probably yeah don't.
Hold it too close either - this is.
Giving me trooper phobia.
It has a quartz in it what ties this.
Doesn't it.
No it's disgusting okay is that are you.
Sad opening the highlighter again beauty.
Is pain all right good yeah no i lost.
The final stop.
Yep look buddy doodahs oh yeah okay so.
