Hi sisters james turrell sood welcome.
Back it's my youtube channel if you're.
Thinking wow james you look not good i.
Would be thinking yes it's currently.
00 in the morning and i just rolled.
Out of bed and sat down i filmed a video.
After going to bed at 4 a.m. last night.
Filming a video so that's um fun and.
Fresh today i'm doing something crazy.
That i'm actually very very very nervous.
For and i am going to tell you about.
That throughout the year in the beauty.
Community we have a few huge major.
Events called beauty conventions there's.
A lot of them that go by different names.
But overall they have the same kind of.
Purpose of connecting smaller.
Influencers and big brands to allow them.
To network together sell products do.
Demos do classes for influencers to make.
Appearances and they're usually pretty.
Fun i remember a few years ago and i had.
Only 50,000 followers begging and.
Pleading my parents let me use all of my.
Saved up money to fly to california to.
Go to generation beauty i had followers.
But no fans yet no brands had any idea.
Who i was no influences knew who i was i.
Remember my makeup looked literally the.
Absolute worst and as my first time.
Meeting all the major influencers i.
Snuck into the crater cocktail party so.
I got to meet so many people and take.
Photos and it was honestly such a cool.
Experience and it's also the first time.
That ever got on pr list because of you.
Guys know and how fast this sisterhood.
Is growing i don't really go to beauty.
Conventions that often anymore for a lot.
Of reasons but spoiler alert i'm going.
To win today so i'm going to keep those.
Reasons to myself because i don't wanna.
Get yelled at.
After this video even though i.
Personally choose to not go to these.
Conventions much anymore it has been.
Several years since i've attended one.
The industry is ever-changing and it's.
Been a very very long time since i've.
Been able to interact with fans.
Different beauty influencer people.
Different brands and i'm kind of curious.
As to how these conventions are running.
Are they going smoothly after tana khan.
I feel like anything would be going.
Smoothly in comparison to that but i.
Really want to get the inside scoop see.
How people are feeling about the.
Industry right now who they like who.
They don't like what brands they like.
Which brands they don't like so for.
Today's video i thought i'd doing this a.
Few weeks ago and i can't believe this.
Is actually coming to life but i hired.
An extremely talented special effects.
Artists you guys are going to me in a.
Few short minutes and today i am get.
Fully professionally transformed into a.
Completely different human being and i'm.
Going to be sneaking into beautycon and.
Interviewing a ton of people about the.
Makeup industry you guys i'd like to.
Introduce you to my very very special.
Guest today this is joining welcome to.
Our channel are you excited i am really.
Excited but also really nervous okay.
Because this is a huge transformation.
John explained like briefly what we're.
Really doing okay so james contacted me.
For this super secret sister makeover.
And he basically wanted to be in.
Disguise to go to beauty con yes and we.
Decided to do something like an older 30.
Year-old male very masculine so he's.
Gonna have a beard he's gonna have.
Facial features that change with the.
Prosthetics he's going to have a wig on.
We'll do something with the brows will.
Change wardrobe and he will be a new man.
Oh my god.
How long would you this process is gonna.
Take usually special effects makeup.
Artists have like three or four people.
Working on one person they still can.
Take up to five hours five to six hours.
Eight hours the more pieces the longer.
It takes to apply how many pieces do you.
Have today.
Um i think we have five what do you.
Think it's gonna be the hardest aspect.
Of it successfully pulling off this.
Sister secret surprise i would say your.
Face but we have that under control yeah.
That's girls have it covered yes i think.
The next biggest challenge would be just.
Staying in character and keeping your.
Mannerisms in check yeah oh yeah i'm.
Gonna have to say hey guys for all the.
Clips today which is gonna be a.
Challenge already i have to really focus.
On slowing my words down i also have to.
Try to go from being like a 98 percent.
Gay man to a like roughly 32% gay man or.
I'm out we already went ahead and took.
Off all my jewelry earlier on.
Which was very emotionally hard for me.
Oh she stuck oh oh hello hey take off my.
Cardi doesn't look i can never do this.
With nails this limb you didn't have to.
Use a screwdriver for so please don't.
Ever try to rob me or cut my hand off on.
The streets because even if you do you.
Won't be able to get it so gotcha with.
That one i'd literally don't think i've.
Taken this bracelet off since i bought.
It.
What the heck righty-tighty lefty-loosey.
Right yes right lefty.
Oh there we go oh jesus it's early my.
Hand is shaking what the head unscrew oh.
Oh no i only took six hours for no.
Reason do you think it's solid gold.
Sister's necklace i'll give it away.
Oh hey katie girls what have my producer.
Kelly taking off my neck last cuz it's.
Stuck on my body.
Wow that was easy yeah well it's.
Official ladies i officially am worth.
$0.00 as a human being so know your luck.
Dear oh okay ladies it's a fish little.
Guy especially where $0.00 as a human.
Being so that's really fun and fresh but.
I want to offer such as a good.
Personality good personality.
Coincidentally as well this week has.
Also been one of the most stressful of.
My entire life so i may or may not have.
Bitten off all of my acrylic nails which.
Is actually great for this video because.
I think that may be a very intense.
Giveaway i'll give you go down well i.
Have a million questions that i want to.
Ask you tanning i am so sated for this.
Food today i think you are so talented.
And i'm putting my face in your hands.
I'm very very nervous i'm not even gonna.
Lie it not because i don't trust you.
Because i don't trust myself so we have.
Five hours ahead of us i think we need.
To buckle up get ready to go get ready.
To his sister's secret surprise.
Everybody and should we get started on.
This transformation.
So a few nights ago channing came over.
To my apartment for the first time ever.
And made a life cast a life cast of my.
Face which was um probably hmm.
One of the scariest and worst hours of.
My entire life but they're doing that.
She was able to actually make a full.
Plate of a wonderful prosthetics that.
Are gonna be glued on and we'll roll the.
Footage right now and show you guys how.
That process went because i'm sure.
You're just going to love watching these.
Suckers walk us through your process.
Like what are we doing i am looking.
Right at home look like at west.
Hollywood trash can it's silicone body.
Double it's what i'm gonna use to laughs.
Cast him it'll come free from like all.
His hair i don't have to use a release.
And it's it's a lot quicker and it lasts.
A lot longer so if james wants to make.
Multiple life casts of himself he can.
This is very good cover no guys please.
Try not to make me laugh once i explain.
Okay.
It kind of feels like cold oh my god.
I'm getting claustrophobic just looking.
At you these might be the best 30.
Minutes in my entire life.
We can legit talk about him and him not.
Even talk back to us so after this i.
Will take it and i'm gonna pour a stone.
In it that we use to make live cast and.
From there i'll start sculpting the.
Prosthetic pieces and from that i'll.
Make a mold of those and i'll pour them.
In more silicone and then they'll be.
Ready to go on oh that's so weird i.
Don't like that i feel like that's.
Really squishy and i hope the sister.
Slice under james's nose okay so now i'm.
Gonna take plaster bandages and make a.
Shell for the silicone mold and it just.
Protects it yes so this is the hardest.
Part of doing it cuz now it's gonna be.
Stiff where he can't move at all and i'm.
Sure he feels it like the difference do.
You feel genius warm it's warm you can.
Feel it he's heard me knock on him like.
20 times now but i'm making sure it's.
Okay hmm.
Wait now start moving your face around.
This is your face really beautiful.
No what's the dot by dudley was like.
Very uncomfortable especially with like.
Everybody's saying funny things i want.
To laugh so bad but it wasn't like pop.
Up so i'm gonna start by cleansing the.
Skin to get rid of any dirt oil all of.
Those things stops from sticking and.
Then i'm taking a skin protectant to put.
On you it's gonna be like damaging to my.
Skin at all no if you remove it.
Correctly then it's totally safe.
A lot of fun so yes starting out i'm.
Using pros aid transfers which are kind.
Of like the same as tattoos you wet the.
Back of the paper like literally a.
Temporary tattoo and then you just blend.
The edges off with alcohol for head well.
You have a lot of space to work with.
So what like are you interested in.
Special effects like in the first place.
And the tricks that they pull love that.
For you or less yes yeah i feel like the.
Lot so if you a definite giveaway most.
30 year-old straight men don't exactly.
Have a viola juvederm until floods but.
You know what we're not judging here wow.
I look like i just gave a really good.
Sister stock since the designs are so.
Small you may not think that like.
They'll do much yeah to the overall look.
But once you see it come together you'll.
Realize like oh it took that little.
Amount mm-hmm to change a feature uh-huh.
This is low-key really relaxing i don't.
Want to fall asleep research any you're.
Saying you loved horror movies that's.
Kind of what you got you know special.
Effects what are some of your favorite.
Horror movies that you've seen.
I love all the saw movies i figured you.
Would like those yeah yeah it's just.
Like the thing that inspires me is the.
Fact that you can literally just take.
Someone a regular human and turn them.
Into this like creature this monster so.
Now i'm going to take silicon.
Encapsulated pieces and apply them to.
James i'm gonna start with his chin oh.
God.
So these are the pieces that channing.
Came over a few days ago to premake oh i.
Know you're not giving me a double.
Chattering bruda just kind of like with.
The pros aid transfers these blend off.
With alcohol as well well probably the.
First and only time alcohol will be.
Featured on the james charles youtube.
Channel i'm a sober sister.
My butt chin has gone oh now know about.
Of jaw clenching her face didn't can fix.
This that's my worst nightmare oh no.
Oh my god you've got to be kidding me.
So channing how long did you actually go.
To cosmetic school for but they take you.
Through everything so quickly which i.
Think is a good thing.
Yeah are you a fast learner i am same.
That was my biggest thing in school.
Would be like i would learn the lesson.
Once and then they'd keep going through.
It and reviewing and i was like oh my.
God so now i'm gonna put on cheek pieces.
For james what is this gonna do to the.
Jawline of my cheekbones and it's gonna.
Round it off it's not gonna be as.
Structured okay out of all the things.
That you've learned how to do what's.
Been your hardest like transformation or.
Like special effect yeah i'm so in.
School.
In the special effects class we have to.
Like sculpt and make our own monster and.
That was probably the hardest thing that.
I've ever done.
Really yeah cuz start to finish it was.
Like a four week process for weeks holy.
Crop everything in school is pretty much.
Like that i kind of rather than be that.
Way because i think it just prepares you.
More how would you compare like this.
Transformation type to like the stuff.
That you're doing in school like the.
Monster soph.
Music.
This is more difficult in the fact that.
It's like realism right a monster you.
Can just be like as creative and crazy.
As you want this is like all about.
Making sure you paint it right making.
Sure your edges are blended really.
Nicely so this is harder whoa i don't.
Know why i'm so nervous for this hello.
Everybody my name is tom and welcome to.
Beauty cod that's not like a man no.
That's still okay i could be a really.
Gay bad it bros its mark question right.
Now and let's see do both and pretend.
That you're asking a question hey who.
Would you say your favorite influencers.
And oh no.
Who would you say right now are your.
Favorite influencers in the beauty.
Community and who is your least favorite.
That still sounded like me huh.
I love this.
Have a pop in the middle i face i think.
This is the finished look right here.
Guys so right now i'm taking bondo which.
Is just like a thickened adhesive to.
Help blend the edges of the prosthetic.
Into the skin better so is this like the.
Final set before we get to the painting.
Yeah okay guys we just had breakfast and.
We are back and we're ready to start.
Painting this is where actually it gets.
Like real and it starts to like look.
Like a real person hello hi and i took.
My wig off because mama's hot and she's.
Working love okay so now i'm gonna start.
Painting with alcohol paints and the.
Reason why we use alcohol paints is.
Because there's still translucent so it.
Makes it look like skin like you're not.
Taking a bunch of product on you can.
Still have translucency with it so how.
Many layers of paint would you typically.
Do for this you just build them up until.
It gets to like a skin tone type of base.
Like it's a multiple layered thing like.
You can't just go in one or two layers.
So now i'm going to take the beer that i.
Made and apply it with spirit gum i'm so.
Not gonna be a bad i'm so excited i'm.
Gonna be a bad.
Oh my god hey brothers what's my name.
Stephen eight years of races and.
Brushing my teeth about to go down the.
Drain alright guys i guess this is the.

Now i love james charles it's pretty.
Funny we're on the way right now to.
Beautycon and i'm not even gonna lie.
Like i'm feeling really really nervous.
Right now i never ever get nervous to.
Like be in front of people but i think.
I'm nervous because like this is not.
Like me i'd have to like ah i'd have to.
Like play a part i guess i'm just.
Confirmed because i really want to see.
The sisters and stuff but it can like.
These conventions can be a major safety.
Hazard and i'm just praying that we.
Don't get caught because if we do it's.
Literally over and this whole entire.
Thing is ruined at this point i think.
Channing did literally such a phenomenal.
Job i don't think it's gonna be the face.
That's gonna be an issue if anything i.
Think it'll be the voice or like if i.
Slip up on my man voice or like my.
Mannerisms i speak with my hands so much.
Like so so so much my stomach kind of.
Feels like right now and i think it's.
Because i'm getting the feeling of how i.
Used to get when i first went to these.
Conventions as if i'm not important.
Because there's me a million people.
There and it's like it's very.
Overwhelming they're always very very.
Crowded and very very packed and like.
Everybody's super stater to see the.
People that they love and the brands.
They love but normally now when i can.
Walk into an event or a convention i.
Have a full team of people around me.
That are protecting me that are making.
Sure i'm led to the right places getting.
Like you know what i mean like i'm very.
Coordinated at these type of events and.
This were literally walking in of course.
Hopefully they won't be able to see it's.
Me but it's still kind of like that same.
Feeling of like oh i don't really know.
What is gonna happen i'm not really sure.
How that's gonna go if i'm being.
Completely honest i'm just a little bit.
Nervous i just want this to go well we.
Just got here we have to find the.
Entrance now i don't really know where.
We're going.
I'm very scared i'm gonna be honest but.
Let's get this over with.
Applause.
