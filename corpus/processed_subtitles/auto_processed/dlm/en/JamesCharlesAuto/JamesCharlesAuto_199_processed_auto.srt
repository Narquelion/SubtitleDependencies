Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel so if.
He wants to go i did a video on my.
Channel called testing a fake makeup.
Where i went down to santee alley and if.
You are an alley native you know that.
That is like the holy grail of all fake.
Products and all i can knock off or.
Really really cheap goods and i did a.
Video testing out fake makeup products.
Where i did like knockoffs of all like.
High-end name-brand stuff you guys.
Absolutely love that video and there's.
One of the most dude on my entire.
Channel so thank you for that and i got.
So many comments ask me to do it again.
And what are the main comments that i.
Got in the video as well as that i.
Should have gotten the real versions of.
All the fake products and tested them.
Out half and half which i was like oh.
Yeah that would've been a really smart.
Idea so today i'm coming at you with a.
Part two of testing fake makeup i have a.
Ton of new products that i do not try.
Out in the last video the real versions.
And the fake versions as well so we're.
Gonna do half and half and compare how.
The real products compared to the fake.
Ones so yeah without further ado let's.
Go ahead and get started so i actually.
Don't have any base products that test.
Out for you guys the only foundation.
That i've ever seen a fake version of is.
The mac one that i used in last video.
But what i do have is a knockoff beauty.
Blender that i found so i'm gonna go.
Ahead and use a knockoff beauty blender.
And a real beauty blender on different.
Sides of my face using my regular.
Foundation and we're gonna see how they.
Actually apply if they apply the same if.
They're different so yeah what i find.
Weirdest about this knockoff beauty.
Blender is the fact that it comes in a.
Plastic package that literally says the.
Original beauty blender and i've had at.
Many beauty blenders in the past and.
This is literally the same exact plastic.
Packaging that the regular beauty.
Blender has come in which is very very.
Suspicious but if you take the actual.
Sponge out it is definitely a different.
Shade of pink a different shape as well.
This one is slightly more fat and the.
Texture is completely different oh god.
Alright so these are both completely.
Soaked and then wrung out this is.
Obviously the fake one it has not.
Changed in size in the slightest and.
This is the real beauty blender which is.
Now like probably doubled in size so i'm.
Gonna grab my too faced born this way.
Foundation which is only a longtime.
Favorites right now and just pump a.
Little bit on the back of my hand and.
Then we're going to apply it so this is.
Literally incredibly hard and not like.
Remotely comfortable in the slightest.
You know makeup gurus are always coming.
And i'm beating my face like i am.
Literally having to beat my face at this.
Product i'm gonna go ahead and now grab.
My real beauty blender into the born.
This way foundation and do the rest of.
My face oh so much better so the non.
Beauty blender i bought at sanchi alley.
For a total of nine dollars and the real.
Beauty blender retails at like most.
Makeup stores for i think $20 obviously.
You are saving money by getting the fake.
Version but clearly it is not really.
Working out that well for me you have to.
Blend it out really really really hard.
And just soak up a lot of projects as.
Well so ultimately at the end of the day.
You're just losing money because you are.
Using more your foundation and i'm.
Assuming your concealer when we get to.
That stuff in a second which i am.
Literally horrified for but literally to.
Spend the extra $11 if you have it of.
Course and get the real version because.
It pays off so much better so like i.
Said with the foundation i didn't find.
Any base dupes so i'm gonna go ahead and.
Use the tarte shaped tip concealer in.
The shade lightmedium on both sides.
Then we're just gonna use the different.
Beauty blenders to blend them out.
I'm literally hitting myself so hard to.
Actually like blend out and distribute.
This product which is not what i want to.
Be doing right now using the original.
Issue so much more effortless and not as.
Violent alright so now that the base is.
All on our next step is going to be to.
Powder and once again you guys know that.
I love my beauty blender for this so i.
Just have my regular laura mercier.
Translucent setting powder and i'm gonna.
First got my knocked off beauty blender.
And dip into the powder and i am so.
Horrified for this one being first gonna.
Do my nose on the fake half oh god.
Normally when i do with my regular.
Beauty blender it really helps to melt.
The powder into the skin which creates a.
Really flawless finish i am definitely.
Not achieving that with this sponge at.
All which is why i'm getting like a lot.
Of excess and residue powder on my nose.
Under my eyes as you can see posh like.
Mary is trying to come back today and we.
Are not about to have that happen so i.
Face is aweso and i am currently baking.
At 350 degrees to my face locked in.
Place and all snapped and ready to go.
And of course the next step along always.
Baking is my eyebrows and i do have a.
Knockout product for those and that is.
The anastasia brow definer now i did.
Have a bra definer in the same exact.
Shade and i got dark brown and the fake.
One but i just put on a trip and.
Happened to leave mine there so i had to.
Improvise and instead of using the brow.
Definer today i'm gonna use the.
Broadway's they are both in the shade of.
Dark brown i figured the actual shaper.
The product doesn't really matter that.
Much i'm just gonna compare it to color.
The price and the firm tool and how they.
Actually look on the brows you guys get.
The point my dumb master shouldn't have.
Lost their product in the first place.
Let's go ahead and swatch it on my hand.
To actually see how the colors compare.
So this is the dark brown brown define.
Our oh wow okay so the forma is super.
Super soft as you can see it just broke.
Off almost instantly swatching this on.
My hand i'm gonna try that again so as.
You guys can see i just went ahead and.
Applied the real of dark brown for about.
From honest asya and the fake dark brown.
Is actually darker brown and the real.
Dark brown from actually i besides you.
Know this is a mess that you guys should.
Understand what i'm saying at this point.
And the real dark brown is actually a.
Lot more gray toned and the fake dark.
Brown as well this is a definitely has a.
More red undertone so this is definitely.
Look like more realistic brown hairs on.
The real side but let's go ahead and.
Apply the fake version to the left side.
And the real version to the right side.
Like we did with the beauty blenders and.
Let's see which one actually applies it.
Better when i'm instantly noticing right.
Away - is that the point on the fake oh.
My god ow the point of the actual like.
Tip of the product is not nearly as.
Sharp or defined despite the fact that.
It is the anasazi a brow definer as the.
Original version i'm applying these.
Lines and they're coming out very very.
Thick and usually i'm able to get a very.
Very sharp edge which makes my brow look.
Super super chiseled out but as you can.
See looking at the tail right here it is.
Not chiseled out in the slightest it.
Looks very very messy oh you're kidding.
No okay this eyebrows will be like.
Throwback to original jade charles.
Beauty instagram block eyebrows this.
Looks the worst normally i would go.
Ahead and do my other brow and then.
Conceal after but either way cannot.
Stand to look at this any longer i'm.
Gonna grab some charts shaved and just.
Fixed up with my morphe for anything you.
Brush as always because this is looking.
I don't think i've ever had to work at.
Fixing an eyebrow that badly ever like.
In my entire life as a makeup artist.
That took like at least 30 minutes to do.
This one eyebrow and that should never.
Ever be the case like i get something to.
Finish my entire makeup routine in 30.
Minutes if i'm really going fast so that.
Was awful i definitely would not.
Recommend this wanna be asked brow.
Definer from.
Anasazi of beverly hills i think this is.
A total of 14 dollars at santee alley.
And i think the regular one retails for.
21 dollars so definitely would not.
Recommend her at all come with the.
Original because you don't want to end.
Up with a block eyebrow from the.
Original j charles beauty on instagram.
Those are dark days and we are so glad.
To be away from them let's not go back i.
Think today for the first time ever my.
Right eyebrow is my better brow today.
I don't know this fake bride a finer.
Just really did not do it for me but the.
Original brow was came to slay and came.
To safe today let's go ahead and move on.
From the brows thank god we've been on.
The step for way too long and move on to.
The eye shadow so for the eyes today.
We're gonna be using one palette that i.
Absolutely stand by interviews many.
Times on this channel and that is the.
Morphe brushes collaboration with jaclyn.
Hill the real version is in this hand.
And is $38 at morphe brushes dot-com or.
If you news code change for 10% off and.
Then there's the fake version which i.
Got at san cially for a total of $12 so.
I definitely price different but let's.
Put it actually see if the quality is.
Different because let's be real they're.
Probably gonna be a lot of the colors do.
Look very very similar but there are.
Some huge noticeable differences such as.
This shade right here i mean this is a.
Shimmery bravo highlighting how it and.
This is like literally a bright awesome.
Neon chartreuse color which is.
Definitely not even close to what it is.
Supposed to be this gold shade and the.
Fake version is nowhere near to the gold.
In the original wide this dark brown.
Shape in the original color which is a.
Brownie red undertone is loading another.
Black in the fake palate so oh yeah so.
This one obviously is the real version.
Is much more pigmented and the color is.
Much deeper and more defined as well.
Whereas the fake version definitely is.
Not nearly as shimmery as the real one.
It did honestly swatch much farther than.
I was expected it's not like awful by.
Any means but clearly the original.
Palette is a lot better this is the brow.
Bone highlighting shade which is.
Absolutely stunning i love this color.
And this is the brow bone highlighting.
Shade from the fake palette which is.
That i just pale rusty dusty looking.
Chalk so first go strong with my morphe.
M5 13 brush and dipped into this warm.
Torn orange shade right here in the fake.
Palate and as i start off by dcima in.
The crease oh that is not pigmented and.
Then using a clean version of the same.
Brush i'm going to go to the same exact.
Shade corresponding in the original.
Chocolate palette and do the same thing.
Already as you can see the original.
Palette has a lot more pigment and.
Payoff and is blending up very very.
Nicely next intagram im poor 33 brushes.
My all-time favorite fluffy brush for.
Creases and smokey eyes and there's a.
Gif light brown shade from the pink i'm.
Gonna pop this on the lid the shadow is.
Definitely not letting out as well as.
The first edited i honestly thought that.
I might be struck to the core and have a.
Better version in the end which i was a.
Little bit spooked about but this shadow.
Is nowhere near blending up very well as.
You can see it's looking a super super.
She and this like outer crease region.
I'm gonna go ahead and grab some more.
Pigment onto the brush and really pack.
It on there to try to create a more.
Uniform color but this is now looking as.
Free as i was expecting it to look well.
I wasn't expecting it to look good but.
Then i was a little bit shocked and now.
I'm unsure you get the point i'm gonna.
Grab my other m 4-3-3 brush and dip into.
The same exact shade corresponding from.
The real version of the chocolate.
Palette and put that on the other lid.
Next underground miami.
07 brush and dip into this dark brown.
Shade in the bottom half of the palette.
And use this too deep enough to smokey.
Eye for being fake shadows honestly.
These have a ton of pigmentation and are.
Going on a super nicely but they're just.
Not blending out like in the slightest.
This literally looks the worst ever like.
That is not how a smokey eye should be.
Blunt action okay so my camera decided i.
Didn't catch it in time but i just use.
My morphe m14 line pencil brush and.
Dipped it into this blue shade in both.
The fake version and the real version.
And apply them and they are definitely.
Looking very very different the real.
Version is a lot more blue and a lot.
More pigmented whereas the fake person.
Is a lot more green tone and is nowhere.
Near as pigmented as the real version.
There is no sparkle to this whatsoever.
So definitely the real version is a lot.
Better maxilla gonna have an e at 19.
Brush and dip into the brow bone.
Highlight.
With just this right that's yellow and.
The top corner oh god oh no not did.
Absolutely nothing okay let's try that.
Again using the same exact brush the.
Clean version and dip into the real.
Problem shaking ah there we go.
At least that definite looks a whole lot.
Better than that musty crusty dusty.
Yellow that literally looks like nothing.
So that's good at least alright so those.
Are both smoky is all complete from the.
Fake palette i was honestly really.
Surprised to see that the shadows were.
Pretty pigmented but as you could see.
They really do not blend out at all.
There is so much passion is going on.
Especially out in this outer corner from.
The dark brown shade that just did not.
Want to blend at all and this blue shade.
On the lower lash line is nowhere near.
As pigmented as the real version wears.
On this side of the smokey eye is.
Definitely a lot more blown oh and.
Blended it is a more nutritional smokey.
Eye whereas on this side somehow it.
Became bright ass orange which i do not.
Want their arse a nice blue pop of color.
On the lower lash line which actually.
Shows up and the highlights are also.
There as well and not looking talky and.
Invisible whereas on this side they're.
Gone the real version is obviously a lot.
More expensive but you're paying for.
Quality pigmentation and blend ability.
Which this palette obviously does not.
Have so if you're gonna buy heading out.
Of the - same theme as everything else.
So far oh this video by the real version.
Spend a little bit more money and get a.
Great house product moving on for the.
Highlanders today we're gonna be using.
The iconic kylie cosmetics watts at and.
This is the real version and this is the.
Fake version when you open them up the.
Pan sizes are obviously a whole lot.
Bigger and the real version than the.
Fake version and for the most part the.
Colors actually look pretty similar.
Except for the thought that.
Do-not-disturb was obviously a whole lot.
More bright pink and the fake version.
Then in the real version to do a swatch.
Comparison i'm gonna grab a privacy.
Pleat on my pointer finger and then i'm.
Gonna grab it on my middle finger on the.
Other hand.
Whoa okay so privacy please from the.
Original kelly paula is ridiculously.
Penguin said i've actually never tried.
These calendars out before this promise.
Actually my baby amanda and things still.
Thank you to her for letting me borrow.
It and then the privacy please from the.
Big charlie paula is a lot less.
Pigmented as you can see and definitely.
Nowhere near as a metallic or reflected.
As the original it is just kind of like.
White satin finished kind of like more.
Like an eyeshadow rather than an actual.
Highlighter this is really really.
Stunning oh that was really.
Underwhelming place oh there's literally.
Just like no pigmentation in this.
Whatever this is after three different.
Dips into the highlighter and as you can.
See this claw is a little sad as you can.
See for literally just one dip into the.
Original palette it is a whole lot more.
Pigmented a lot more blending the highly.
Is a lot more sparkly as well but i.
Honestly really really like how this.
Looks.
Whereas on the fake side we get nothing.
Obviously i can't believe put my nose in.
Half so i'm just gonna use the real.
Version on my nose so it doesn't look.
The worst papa oh well that is a.
Blinding highly oh my gosh whoa okay so.
Now that the blow is all complete i.
Guess kinda sorta our last steps it is.
Gonna be the lipid ii doodahs and i.
Think i have the funniest comparison yet.
And those are the k'kaw creme lipsticks.
From kylie cosmetics and yeah this is.
What we got oh my god oh wait the the.
Colors the most nude light shade in the.
Real version is literally like bright.
Ass orange this looks like anastacio.
Ashton liquid lipstick in the fake.
Version was good and apply these and see.
What they actually look like next to.
Each other oh it smells like paint it.
Literally smells like acrylic paint this.
Is probably so unsafe but i'm gonna go.
Out and apply this shade camee to the.
Fake side of my lips.
Okay so the actual chemi smells like.
Nothing which is great i'm gonna go.
Ahead and apply the real version on to.
The real half of my face you get the.
Point right now so i know that's like.
K'kaw cream liquid lipsticks are.
Supposed to not dry down obviously the.
Real version is still like a white.
Looking whereas the fake version have.
Dried down completely matte but even.
Just formula aside though if you're.
Gonna disrespect a brand and all the.
Hours and money that they put into a.
Product by copying them like can we at.
Least try to get the color like.
Relatively similar i mean like what is.
That okay so normally my last step and.
Obviously beaches at my face in place.
But this just looks the worst ever so i.
Definitely do not want to keep this.
Makeup on for any longer and that is my.
Full face of like us half face of fake.
Makeup part two i'll complete i really.
Really hope you guys know this video and.
Definitely become a down below and tell.
Me what side of the face you think looks.
Better after testing out all these.
Products i'm definitely gonna have to.
Say that the real side of makeup.
Definitely is my winner here a lot of.
These fake makeup products cannot even.
Close to compare to the real versions.
Listen i know the low price tags can.
Sometimes be really really appealing to.
You grant or on a budget.
Trust me i get it makeup can sometimes.
Be so so expensive but by putting all.
These fake products on today i am taking.
A huge risk a lot of times these fake.
Products are nowhere near the same.
Chemical composition as the real.
Versions they can sometimes contain a.
Really really harmful and bad chemicals.
To your essence put on your face then.
You're not just inhale and like your.
Lips or your eyes so if you can.
Definitely some of the action money's to.
Get the real versions i mean it's gonna.
Pay off in a frontal on peg rotational.
Makeup in general so i definitely not.
Recommend any of these products at all.
Alright sisters if you guys enjoyed.
