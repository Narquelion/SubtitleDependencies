Grateful for all of you guys and all of.
Your support my life has been is so.
Crazier than the past several months and.
You sisters have olive definitely.
Noticed it i've been of course posting.
On my regular production schedule but i.
Have not been as active on snapchat on.
Instagram and obviously you guys all.
Know now what all the work and love was.
Going into it was creating the palette.
And the commercial of all the beautiful.
Looks surrounding it but as soon as it.
Launched i was ready to for once in my.
Entire life take a little breather.
Moment relax chill hang with my family.
And friends and also celebrate and it.
Has been an amazing three weeks and i am.
So incredibly grateful for all of you.
Guys for understanding letting me.
Breathe that letting me actually take.
Some time for myself but i am back and.
Today we are celebrating so first and.
Foremost before you even jump into the.
Makeup of today's video i first want to.
Say thank you most importantly to every.
Single one of you guys out there for.
Everything and for supporting me because.
We have a lot of things to be.
Celebrating in today's video um let's do.
A quick little recap so this all started.
A few weekends ago with myself and my.
Team traveled to minnesota to open the.
Biggest murphy store in the entire world.
Located involve america it was so beyond.
Crazy oh my god hundreds and hundreds of.
Sisters showed up literally hours before.
You guys are even supposed to we were.
Able to bring them hot chocolate and.
Donuts make sure everyone was safe in.
The cold winter people ended up taping.
Inside at the mall and it the next.
Morning we were greeted by thousands and.
Thousands of you guys.
At the mall for the ribbon-cutting it.
Was so crazy one of the best days of my.
Entire life anyway truly never forget.
Then we had a hop on a plane to la acts.
Really quickly because my family and.
Little brother just got to town to.
Celebrate the fun events coming up with.
Him in the next week and the next day.
Thanks to all of you sisters voting like.
Crazy every single day we won together.
The people's choice awards for 2018 best.
Beauty influencer of the year which is.
So incredibly crazy and i am so grateful.
For it i got to give it to amazing fans.
And makeover on the red carpet and.
Accept my trophy right then and there.
You may have missed it since my category.
Was not televised apparently when you.
Get hundreds and hundreds of thousands.
Of votes if you're a digital influencer.
Or you're still not important enough.
Which is just lovely so fighting against.
That every single day but regardless.
It's the people's choice awards and that.
Means you guys voted and that means way.
More to me than any trophy that we can.
Win any single day so still thank you.
The most.
So the pcs were on a sunday and the next.
Thing was monday meaning it was my.
Pallet launch party tonight and oh my.
God you guys i was so beyond excited.
This party was planned at very very.
Last-minute so myself in the morphe team.
Were literally hustling all day long.
Picture was actually gonna be ready for.
Everybody to come and celebrate inspired.
By the unleash your inner artist theme.
Of the palette it was an all-white party.
Which proved to not last for very long.
Judging by myself getting paint pour all.
Over me and my iconic custom outfit but.
It was truly a night i will never forget.
And i am so grateful to have every.
Single person in my life that has been.
Supporting me since day one i was.
Sobbing crying during my little speech.
With linda murphy the owner and ceo i.
Really don't cry or get emotional that.
Often i will say i definitely have built.
Up a very very thick skin over the past.
Several years but there were just so.
Many people they were supporting me that.
I could not help but get so emotional.
And be so grateful for everything that.
Has happened in the past few months so i.
Sobbed thank all the makeup was okay but.
After that i got ruined by gallons and.
Gallons of paint being poured on me.
Regardless and my outfit being.
Completely ruined well not really ruined.
Oh i guess because everybody got to.
Unleash their inner artist at the party.
Which was so much fun i am so incredibly.
Grateful for everybody in my life that.
Was able to make it and also everybody.
Who wasn't able to make it as well.
Obviously.
A lot of charges going on at the time in.
California with the fires and so many.
Other things but the support has meant.
So much to me regardless and also major.
Thank you as well to every single person.
On the murphy team that i have worked or.
That sense day wanted this collaboration.
It has been so incredibly amazing and i.
Could not believe it is finally here and.
Without everybody this would not have.
Happened so you guys know who you are.
Love you all the most after the launch.
Party everybody jumped in the party bus.
Back to my house and we were literally.
00 in the morning.
Celebrating um everybody got very they.
Had fun and so did i but i'm a sister.
Sober of course as if you guys know.
Because i had to wake up in literally.
Two hours because the next day was a.
00 a.m. with.
My parents and some of the more fut.
Members who had slept over was neither.
Fun nor rational either right now but it.
00 a.m.
Pacific standard time.
We broke make up history with the launch.
Of the james charles x morphe palette.
And oh my god you guys i am so.
Incredibly grateful we launched with.
Quite a lot of units i obviously cannot.
Release those numbers but we sold out of.
The entire collection in europe.
Australia and canada in less than 10.
Minutes and sold out globally in less.
Than one day breaking morphe records and.
Having their highest sales day in.
History which is iconic well i'll be are.
Celebrating the palette sellout i don't.
Even know how it happened but you guys.
Pulled together and we had 10 million.
Sister subscribers on this youtube.
Channel oh my god you guys we started.
This channel only three years ago now.
And never in 10 million years did i ever.
Think we would get this far.
I like i cannot believe the progress.
That we've had together as a family.
This journey has been a quite the roller.
Coaster but i started this with a.
Mission in mind of creating beautiful.
And creative makeup looks creating.
Entertainment content making you guys.
Happy and i can truly say we haven't.
Shaken up the beauty industry for the.
Better and then literally one day later.
We also some have energy to hit 10.
Million on instagram as well bringing.
Our total like social media reach to.
Over 20 million sisters which is so.
Beyond crazy i feel like we're literally.
Running a nation up.
Here and it feels so amazing and i am so.
Incredibly grateful for every single one.
Of you guys trust me if it were not for.
You i would not be here and that is a.
Judgment promise i love my job and i am.
So grateful that i get to do it and.
Inspire you guys every single day and.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Truly after all those amazing things.
That went on i decided for once in my.
Life to take a little bit of a break.
Most importantly i wanted to celebrate.
With everybody in my life that means the.
Absolute most me but i also wanted to.
Chill to relax it take some time for.
Myself and my mental health because it.
Was a little sister struggling and.
Ally but i also took a few days.
As well to plant some really amazing.
Content coming soon i am so beyond.
Excited and after all that i am ready to.
Be back to pump up some amazing videos.
For you guys of course using this baby.
Right here and that leads us to today's.
Brand new video.
So you guys saw the finished and.
Beautiful 52 second commercial that i.
Was so incredibly proud of but what you.
Don't know is that that commercial was.
Shot not once but twice and both times.
Took well over a week to produce we.
Literally hired a videographer to come.
On set and film the makeup creation.
Process of every single one of those.
Looks so i could later convert it into a.
Tutorial for this youtube channel but.
That didn't exactly work out when it.
Started taking five six seven hours to.
Create each look so unfortunately i do.
Not have tutorials of the campaign books.
Except for of course the unleash your.
Inner artist book which if you have not.
Seen that video make sure to click right.
Up here and i'm trying to think what i.
Want to do for my ten million video i.
Have to do something big iconic i have.
To celebrate and i thought do i want to.
Brace myself and do every single one of.
Those looks again and film them as.
Tutorials and i came to the conclusion.
No i'd rather not die on camera so then.
I was thinking okay and maybe i'll make.
It a lot easier for myself and just do.
One of the locks so i created it and.
After reading through thousands of.
Replies i gathered that you guys kind of.
Liked all of them and nobody could agree.
So i do of course have a compromise.
Hopefully i can actually pull this off.
But so my favorite looks that i've been.
Seeing so far from you sisters that have.
Been actually able to get the palette.
And start to play with it happen looks.
Or you can bind a few different of the.
Campaign images into one so for today's.
Video since you guys could not decide at.
Which look you liked better i thought i.
Would have went out the palette.
Absolutely literally every single color.
In here and try to recreate all the.
Campaign images on my face.
One time this is gonna be a little bit.
Of like a weird mix of a tutorial video.
But also mostly just be playing the.
Actual palette.
I'll show you guys every single color.
And they're the techniques that i like.
To use for maximum color payoff and.
Blend ability and also a little bit of a.
Behind-the-scenes look of how i created.
Every single one of these looks so.
Without further ado oh kyra pink kitty.
Drink idiot grab a snack and let's get.
Started and i'll leash our in our.
Artists.
Music.
After looking at all the images and.
Stalking a few guys on twitter as well i.
Saw this look by yani mui she's home.
Credibly talented and she actually.
Combined all the campaign looks into one.
I'm gonna change a few things but i'm.
Gonna use her photos inspirations today.
Because i think she did a really good.
Job picking the places to put everything.
So thanks girl let's get started my base.
Is already on because this video is.
Gonna be focused on mostly at shadows da.
So i'm gonna go ahead and grab my mac.
Paint pot in the shade up painterly and.
My morphe m17 3 brush that this is in.
The jamesrowe specs morphe brush.
Collection and we're gonna use this to.
Prime my eyelids and get ready for.
Shadow sorta often that's gonna grab up.
My palate oh my god it feels so crazy to.
Actually say that holy crap um i.
Promised yours will not come looking.
Like this this is actually the first one.
That was ever made so i've been.
Traveling with this and using this for.
Several months now she's been through.
Quite a lot she's been dropped she's.
Been you she's been dug in too but she.
Still gets the job done so i'm gonna.
First grab with my morphe m4a3 3 brush.
And just dip into the shade at you're.
Kidding which is literally the best.
Bruntlett which is literally the best.
Bright red and the entire world and i'm.
Just going to it start laying that on.
The eyelid this property's gonna be the.
Easiest eye look you'll ever do because.
We were literally just doing a look at.
How pigmented that is i'm just packing.
This color right onto the lid over top.
Of my mac paint pot aka dry base.
Formulated specifically for the eyes.
Because those are the techniques that.
Are gonna give you the best results as i.
Said a million times i'm gonna use that.
Brush to kind of stamp out roads a.
Little bit because i am gonna kind of.
Wing it this out and pull it towards my.
Temple and then with whatever access.
Shadow is left on that brush i'm just.
Gonna start lightly going over those.
Edges to buff them out and make sure.
They are nice and blended.
I'm gonna have a little bit of a.
Fluffier brush and use this to go over.
The edges and start drying out this red.
Eye shadow down underneath the eyeball.
And also kind of everywhere else as well.
To make this look less weight and i.
Don't 501 brush i'm gonna dip into the.
Shader literally it next to you're.
Kidding.
I'm gonna give that a quick spritz i'll.
Buy a weapon set setting spray and use.
That to meld together the red tones and.
The highlighter that i already had on oh.
My god i love the shadow so what much.
The last step of the love stay click.
It's of course the hearts now on the day.
Of set i actually put on a heart sticker.
First and then did all the red and just.
Peeled it off and we had a nice and.
Negative space moment i do not have any.
More heart stickers and i could not find.
Them at the craft stores today for some.
Reason so we're now going to draw them.
On and hope that it looks okay i'm gonna.
Put one right here oh thank god.
Oh my god okay i'm gonna put another one.
Right here i'm gonna quickly set that in.
Place with just a little bit of canvas.
On a tiny little pencil brush just to.
Make sure that concealer doesn't move.
Around i do a little heart in the inner.
Corner to kind of cue alright that is.
The elastic i've already done and.
Completes i'm gonna grab the same brush.
And painterly and pop some on the other.
Eyelid and get started on the blue book.
I'm first gonna grab the about four five.
Six which is my brush that i actually.
Created with morphia this is the tiny.
Blending brush and dip into the shader.
Cola and i'm gonna use this to start.
Building out the outer v i'm placing on.
This color first because in order to get.
Really really pigmented and bright dark.
Blues you do have to use a slightly.
Different techniques than a typical.
Eyeshadows like i talked about in my.
Original video which for some reason.
Caused quite the controversy very.
Literally no reason at all for me.
Personally i definitely felt as though.
My reveal video was very very upfront.
And honest you guys about the palette.
And the different aromas and the.
Techniques that you should be using and.
The different products that work best of.
It in order for you guys to obviously.
Get the best possible results and for.
Some reason a lot of people seem to.
Think that i was lying or that i was.
Trying to get more money out of you guys.
Which first of all i don't even.
Understand how that even be a thought.
Process considering the product that i.
Recommended to work fast with this.
Morphe eyeshadow palette was a mac paint.
Pot they are sharing none of the same.
Monies that's not even helping morphe.
It's just generally a really bomb.
Product that myself and the morphe.
Product development team have found.
Works really really well with these type.
Of shadows but also as well if you guys.
Have follow me for a very very long time.
You would know that i definitely used to.
Get involved with quite a lot of drama.
In the social media space and i used to.
Have a very very snappy mouth and i've.
Been working on that.
Over the past several years and i feel.
Like i've definitely gotten way better.
At biting my tongue and not replying to.
People but watching these palin videos.
Oh my god you guys third but it.
Definitely a few at this point that i.
Wanted to literally reach through my.
Computer screen and be like why what are.
You doing now if any of us actually have.
The palate you may have noticed that on.
The front packaging it says the james.
Charles artistry palette now this is not.
Because of the unleash your inner artist.
Bono it is actually because when i got.
The opportunity to create this palette.
With morphe i said i wanted to create.
Literally the best rainbow mattes on the.
Market and that we definitely did but.
What i've learned is that when.
Pigmentation is your number one priority.
Which for me it 100% was some of the.
Shades actually do have to be formulated.
Just slightly differently than a typical.
Eyeshadow in order to get those really.
Really bright and vivid pigments to.
Create beautiful rainbow looks i've.
Talked about that several times now.
That's what i was talking about in my.
Original reveal video when it came to.
Press pigments versus typical eyeshadows.
And people really really read on that.
And i'm really glad that this is kind of.
Created a bigger discussion about the.
Actual ingredients and makeup but who.
Some of the things that i've been seeing.
People saying or doing regarding these.
Actual shades have been interesting to.
Watch say the least.
Since this is the unleash your inner.
Artist palette i figured the best.
Possible example i could give to you.
Guys would be an actual artist if an.
Artist was going to paint a picture they.
Would never slap paint onto a canvas sit.
Back and wait for it to magically blend.
Together to create a beautiful piece of.
Art no that is the whole point of being.
An artist you actually have to put in.
The work you have to build up your.
Talent level you have to use the right.
Materials tools paint brushes paints and.
Put it on the right canvas to produce.
The final product if you want to create.
A beautiful watercolor painting it does.
Not matter how bright how vivid how.
Blendable or how expensive your.
Watercolor kit is because chances are if.
You apply those colors to a canvas.
They're simply never going to perform as.
Well as they could if they were applied.
To watercolor paper now same thing goes.
To acrylic paint or oil paint if you.
Apply those paints to a watercolor paper.
Chances are the paints are probably.
Going to soak through and melt it and.
It's going to be a huge mess now of.
Course you can do those things if you.
Want to there are no rules to art but.
For me i've always looked at makeup.
Specifically eyeshadow and in the same.
Exact way both art and makeup are not.
Easy they take a lot of time a lot of.
Raucous and a lot of talent but i nature.
Artists knows that sometimes switching.
Up your products and techniques to get a.
Better final result is always worth it i.
Was literally so far and deep into that.
Tangent that my camera stopped recording.
And i just missed half of this purple.
Look sorry about that before i move on.
I'm very proud of this palette i've.
Worked way too hard on has to do with a.
Lot of speculation so i just wanted to.
Clear all that up moving on that as the.
Blue look all complete i used the shades.
Hello playground cola and a little bit.
Of brother to pull this all together.
Love how this look turned out and i'm.
Going to move on to it the galaxy log.
Before i do any of the art because the.
Purple is going to be it's super super.
Easy so what i've done so far is grab.
The morphe m 4-3-3 brush and i've just.
Dip it into the shade single and i've.
Used this too it just kind of stipple it.
All over my face.
Really really nicely just to get a light.
Wash of purple on there i want to get.
Like that nice kind of almost splotchy.
Wash of color lay down in this area so i.
Can add on lots of other things on top.
And even though we are doing this mostly.
I am definitely trying to keep most of.
The pigment like right around kind of.
The nose bridge and around like this.
Inner cheek region and lightly blending.
Out those edges so even if it's splotchy.
It still looks good now with that same.
Exact brush i'm gonna dip into the shade.
Escape and i'm gonna use this once again.
To kind of splotchy li just dab on some.
More pigment and dimension and then.
06.
Brush and dip into the black shade it's.
Spooky and i'm just gonna do a little.
Bit of this because it definitely goes a.
Long way it this is so pigmented and i'm.
Just gonna add on a few more little.
Sister splotches here and there for some.
Final bits of a galaxy dimension now to.
Tie it all together i'm gonna grab the.
Shade artistry which is this a beautiful.
Metallic duo call blue purple shade or.
Right here and i'm gonna go this on my.
Finger and then it's going to a top over.
Some of the areas at the galant oh my.
God look at that.
I'm gonna tap right over some of the.
Areas of the galaxy it to pack the shade.
On there and to add some blue glow now.
Like i was talking about earlier with.
Different formulas being used this is.
Definitely one of the more unique ones.
In the palette i've seen a lot of people.
Watching this one and being a little bit.
Disappointed by the color payoff it can.
Be used on its own if you want and it's.
Still absolutely stunning but the shade.
Is actually meant to be layered over top.
Of other colors hence what i'm doing.
Right now for the fall beautiful effect.
By the way that shade literally is the.
Same way as well this one is meant to be.
A kind of mixing shade for a highlighter.
And blush but can still be used on its.
Own.
Very very beautifully and then last name.
It's gonna grab a simple white liquid.
Liner to add on these stars so probably.
The hardest part this entire campaign.
Was drawing and shading in every single.
One of these hexagons when it came to.
The b look now i think i'm gonna get it.
Done right now to get it over with so i.
Can do the slime and the flame because.
Those are gonna be kind of easy let's do.
This.
To do this i'm just gonna grab an angle.
Brush and i'm gonna dip into the shade t.
In the top right corner let's start the.
First one right here for the next one.
It's gonna do the same exact thing but.
Leave a little bit of a gap in between.
If first i'm a really odd reason do you.
Want to recreate this at home which i.
Don't know why you would but if you just.
Want to be a queen bee for a day and you.
Have trouble with patterns because let.
Me tell you this is hard okay.
We had lipstick nick we're literally on.
Site trying to figure out what shape we.
Were doing for a good like two hours.
Before i actually ended up looking okay.
So i would definitely recommend.
Practicing on like your arm or your leg.
Before you go right onto your face so.
You don't mess up so now i'm gonna grab.
The tiny little faulty brush this is the.
M15 to two of these come in maya brush.
Set and dip it did the shader punish me.
Which is this cool toilet light brown.
And i'm gonna use this shade to blend.
Out all those lines so i want to do the.
Top right corner to be the most dark so.
I'm gonna focus the color right in there.
And then lightly blend out the arc.
Furnace okay i'm just gonna go in now.
And blend out those edges i'm next to.
Get a little small brush and dip into.
The shades in canvas and also a little.
Bit of it be at the bright yellow and.
Use these two colors to kind of.
Highlight the middle of these honey.
Columns so now that the combs are all on.
There at the last and final step of this.
Look is going to be to grab a little bit.
Of concealer and a very tiny liner brush.
This is the amma two-five-zero it's in.
The brush kit and you can take again so.
What we're gonna do.
Music.
Alright so i'm gonna leave the queen bee.
Look alone for right now of course they.
Do want to add honey and later on but.
That's gonna get really messy and really.
Sister sticky so i'm gonna go ahead and.
Move on to the flames to start sketching.
Out the fire i'm just gonna grab a matte.
Orange liquid lipstick this is.
Flamethrower from jeffree star cosmetics.
I would use an orange eyeshadow with.
That it's gonna take me eight hours so.
Sorry about it.
Everybody's just gonna go in and start.
Like sketching the flames for the orange.
I'm gonna grab four three three brush.
08.
First i'm gonna lay this down over top.
Um.
The local dough stick didn't do you have.
To bring it down to my neck okay right.
Like try to take this off i wonder oh my.
God what i was scared and it's not one.
Video without having a mental breakdown.
Like just one.
That took way too long okay now to add.
Some more dimension into the flame so.
We're gonna do is grab a little pencil.
Brush and dip into the shaded b which is.
Literally the best of bright yellow.
Pigment in the entire world and i'm.
Going to put this in like the center.
Areas of the flames so that is the fire.
Look all complete we only have two.
Colors left being the green it's live.
And then also the pink bubblegum now i.
Want to put this line right here join.
For my jaw line so it like makes sense.
Grab a brow garment gravitationally grab.
Gravitationally it's not a word.
Thank you the gravitational pull.
Gravitationally it's a word now i'm.
Gonna put this line here so it makes.
Sense gravitationally but doing that at.
Least this big open space right here i.
Wanted to put a butterfly there but i.
Can't find them that's an issue so i.
Think because of the fact that the pink.
Look was and i look and then that i just.
The bubble i need to somehow get like.
The pink in here somehow so i think i.
Want to draw in a bunch of little pink.
Bubbles as if they're like floating so.
To draw the outline of the bubbles i'm.
Gonna use the kylie liquid lipstick in.
The shade.
No more this is literally an exact match.
To the shade skip so this will be a.
Really good fresh to draw it with that's.
Gonna grab the shade to skip on a flat.
Packing brush and just put that right on.
There using that same brush i'm gonna.
Dip into the shade of pink idiot trinket.
Which is to get a matte super light baby.
Pink i'm gonna put this like here okay.
With a little pencil brush i'm gonna.
Grab a little bit of playground just add.
In just a little bit of blue because why.
Not.
And then same thing with a little bit of.
A social blade as well a little bit of b.
As well then i'm gonna use the white.
Liquid liner once again and just add in.
Some reflections now i'm gonna draw the.
Slime at first using a cream paint just.
To get the outline.
And then just let it get in place using.
A packer brush and the shader social.
There's there's definitely a less self.
Hair in there and then describing a.
Packer brush and that shade a packer.
Brush and the shade socialblade scary.
With that same packer brush i'm just.
Gonna dip into the shades b and also a.
Little bit of flashback as well and use.
Those to highlight inside of the slime.
This tiny little detailing brush so.
Going to dip into the shade daddy and.
I'm gonna use this to shade more of this.
Line and add in some little drip tips.
And then once again at some more white.
Highlights i'm gonna put on a black.
Liquid lipstick up because it's the only.
Color that will not clash with every.
Single one of the other colors in my.
Face this is oprah in the shade dear.
Bronx you can use kojima's for 30% off.
