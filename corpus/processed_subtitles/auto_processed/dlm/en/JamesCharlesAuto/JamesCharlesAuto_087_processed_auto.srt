Hi guys james charles here and welcome.
Back to my youtube channel so for.
Today's video if you read the title it.
Is going to be a review and this is the.
Number two of you on my channel i am.
Very very excited because i had a lot of.
Fun doing it the first one i definitely.
Want to do more reviews in the future.
For new product comes out or you see.
Something that you want me to talk about.
And see what my opinion is please make.
Sure to tweet me earth's napoli so i can.
Definitely make a video on it the new.
Hottest things for you guys that being.
Said i just got a package from a wet and.
Wild in the mail a few days ago editors.
Their brand-new mega push in a.
Collection it came in this cute little.
Cushion looking the box and right up in.
Here and if you open it up the.
Collection comes with six cushion the.
Collection comes with six cushion.
Compacts and three cushion lip creams i.
Have no idea how a cushion lip cream is.
Gonna work but i guess we are going to.
Find out there's a highlight a contour.
As well as four color correctors which i.
Was super excited to try out i have.
Never actually used a cushion of product.
On my face before i know cushion.
Foundations were wildly wildly popular.
For a very very long time a few like.
Month so in the beauty scene but i never.
Actually put one on my face so i'm.
Superduper excited to try them out today.
Looking at this collection right now it.
Says they are fragrance free gluten free.
Cruelty free and vegan as well so that.
Means no animals were harmed in the.
Making of this product which is so.
Amazing because i know a lot of you guys.
To care a lot about that yeah so the.
Cushion compacts retail for $5.99 each.
And the lip cushions retailed for $4.99.
Each so definitely super cheap and.
Affordable but let's go ahead and put.
These products at the real test and see.
How they actually apply on a face before.
We go in with any actual base parts i.
Want to color cracked my face since that.
Is what majority of the set consists of.
So i'm first gonna go to the shade peach.
Which is the orange color corrector and.
That is for dark circles so each thing.
Comes with this little cushion on the.
Inside says wet and wild on it.
Definitely it's super duper cute and.
Then it is protected as well so it can't.
Get dirty thank god and then when you.
Open it up this is what it looks like oh.
God.
Okay looking at this on my hand it's.
Super super light which is definitely.
Very very worrying to me i did just get.
A spray tan so i am darker than normal.
And this is gonna be like a concealer.
Looking color and as well when you do.
Want to correct dark circles you.
Definitely want a pretty light.
Deep or even red shade depending on how.
Dark your skin tone is to really combat.
Deep blues and the purple tones of the.
Dark circles so i'm not really sure how.
This is gonna work but i guess let's.
Just go ahead and get some on the.
Cushion and apply it under the eyes and.
See how it looks i mean the formula.
Feels right that this is definitely not.
The right color that an orange color.
Corrector should be but then again who.
Am i to say what a color should be so i.
Guess we're just gonna continue putting.
This on and see what it looks like later.
On since its for darkest i'm also going.
To take a little more of this and i'm.
Gonna put this on my facial hair area.
Just to combat once again that the blues.
And purple tones that hair gives off i.
Literally just shaved my entire face.
Like two hours ago and it's already.
Coming back n never heard a five o'clock.
Shadow before apparently when you're me.
You get 12 p.m. shadow the next one over.
To use is the shade green which is for.
Redness and once again the green is.
Super super light it literally looks.
White on camera the other green is.
Swatch next to the orange on my hand.
Literally you can barely even tell that.
There's color there normal color.
Correctors that i've seen before are.
Usually a lot deeper but once again not.
Gonna knock it until we put everything.
Else over our top and see how it really.
Looks like i said green color corrector.
So typically for fixing redness and.
Honestly i'm having a decent skin day.
Say so i'm just gonna place this over a.
Few little blemishes over here.
I guess i'm just gonna top the access.
Pot onto my nose because my nose tends.
To get pretty red the other two color.
Factors in the collection are yellow.
Which brightens and then purple which.
Combats yellow and neither one of those.
Are really problems that i have on my.
Face so i guess i'm just gonna skip out.
On those today and move right into.
Foundation now what i find it pretty.
Great about this entire collection is.
That it is the magnet cushion collection.
But the one product that isn't in this.
Collection is a cushion foundation the.
Kind of thing before cushion foundations.
Were hugely popular at one point and.
Even still are today i see a ton of.
People using cushion foundations and.
Rocking them so so well so i was pretty.
Surprised that there wasn't a cushion.
Foundation in this actual collection but.
I went ahead and i picked up the white.
And wild photo focus foundation to go.
With this look i was debating whether or.
Not to use the loreal cushion foundation.
Or the maple you'd won because i heard.
Those are superbomb and i did find them.
At the drugstore but i figured using the.
Wet and wild one are probably a lot.
Better just because these are wet.
Allowed products so i'm sure the.
Formulas will kind of like work a little.
Bit better together than the maybelline.
Formula or the l'oreal formula mixed.
Together might make things look a little.
Bit wonky i just want to get these.
Products a very very fair chance because.
A cushion product definitely is like a.
Weird concept to a lot of people so.
Gotta be fair you feel for my foundation.
Today i picked up the shade a cream.
Beige which is actually the only color.
They had left at my seat yeah so i'm.
Pregnant the shade matches me we're.
Gonna go right ahead let me try this on.
Okay this is not the applicator i was.
It's right there it's gonna layer this.
Right over top of all the color cocktail.
Okay and it's definitely a little bit.
Dark too we can definitely lighten this.
Up a little bit of concealer later on it.
Do not worry.
The foundation is also only $5.99 and.
Wet and loud is definitely not playing.
Around when it comes to these amazing.
Prices.
They say girlies on a budget we got you.
An major respect for that makeup.
Companies so crazy expensive sometimes.
So it's so relieving when we see amazing.
And cheap products but i don't want to.
Call it amazing yet i will let you guys.
Know in a few quick seconds alright so.
That is the foundation all applied over.
Top of the color corrector honestly.
Looking at this in the mirror my face.
Looks so good right now and i know this.
Foundation is not the point of the video.
But for $5.99 i'm a little bit shook to.
Be honest then i definitely will be.
Trying this again for sure and.
Everyday makeup routine because i really.
Like the base a lot moving on to the.
Color correctors they were definitely a.
Lot lighter than normal color correctors.
But my darkness and my redness is pretty.
Even out for the multiple you can't.
Really see anything especially under the.
Eyes equally the eyes look really really.
Bright and nice which definitely does.
Not work with a lot of foundations.
Sometimes i'm not sure how like full.
Coverage this actual foundation is oh my.
God the thing on the back first says.
Goodbye photo flash back maybe that's.
Why i love this foundation so much it.
Doesn't say the level of coverage on the.
Actual foundation bottle but i'm.
Assuming this is pretty pretty full.
Coverage my skin looks very very even.
And i definitely like the way the color.
Corrector applied so once again for only.
Five dollars definitely it not bad i'm.
Liking this a lot so far what we got to.
Concealer once again similar to the.
Foundation there was no pressed cushion.
Concealer so i went and i picked up the.
Photo focus concealer i picked up the.
Shade of light every because once again.
This was the only shade they had and.
Stock at my seed yes see yes you need to.
Step your up i'm just gonna apply.
This like a normal concealer in the high.
Points of my face and blend it out the.
One thing i have noticed about these.
Products is that they all dry down.
Superduper fast including the color.
Correctors i know the foundation and.
Concealer are not like the point of this.
Video but like i said i wanted to use.
Them just to kind of formula match.
They're definitely super super drying.
But that means i might not have to set.
My face today so i'm at the excited to.
See how this turns out now that the base.
Of how they are all on we're gonna do.
Some cream contouring and for this we're.
Gonna use the cushion contour in the.
Shade cafe ah slay that name is.
Literally so cute i cannot get over it.
But similar to the color correctors.
We're gonna open up we're gonna have a.
Little bit of a cushion.
Hey cover and then the contour shade and.
This one actually looks like it's a dark.
Color i thank god here's another thing.
On the back of my hand.
Definitely a pretty it warm tone so this.
Contour is gonna be very very bronze ii.
Who probably will not be using any.
Browser today but let's go ahead and put.
Out the actual face and see how it.
Applies all right so this shade is.
Definitely a very very very light and.
Like i was saying before i do have a.
Spray tan right now so it is barely even.
Showing up my face which is a little bit.
Disappointing to me just because the.
Other two shades are definitely very.
Very light as well so it seems like.
Anybody that's like dar.
Her than the shade mayonnaise will.
Probably not really be able to use this.
Set come on beauty brands we really need.
To stop playing 50 shades of white here.
There are darker people in the world.
That want to wear your makeup all right.
I'm just gonna dip right into my beauty.
Blender with this because of blending.
This out with my little sponge is.
Definitely taking way too long.
And i do not have a lot of time today so.
I'm just going to blend this right and.
Using my beauty blender i'm gonna try to.
Cream contour my nose a little bit too.
Alright and that is the contouring and.
Chiseling all complete i don't hate it.
It definitely looks pretty good but it's.
Definitely just very very very subtle.
Barely there type of situation this is.
Definitely a shade that it's going to.
Work for very very few people because it.
Is so light and bright pigmented which.
Is pretty disappointing like i said.
Before there are so many other shades of.
Color other than the 50 shades of white.
It's particularly one it's going to be a.
Pass rate but i like the color corrector.
So far and let's go ahead and move on.
With the highlighter the last question.
That i'm gonna be using is the.
Highlighter and this is in the shade.
Who's that pearl you guys know that.
Normally i would do my highlighter way.
Later on my makeup routine but i'm just.
Gonna do the base work today i'm gonna.
Do my eyes and make my eyebrows myself.
Off camera because this is a review not.
A makeup tutorial i'm trying to get.
Better at like separating everything and.
Really learn how this type of content.
Works please bear with me but since this.
Is all eye cream and liquid base i want.
To make sure that everything is like in.
The right order and if i do decide to.
Use any powders i don't want to like.
Disrupt the product so this is what the.
Highlighter it looks like in the pan it.
Is a very brainy pinky tone time later.
For sure so let's go ahead and grab our.
Little cushion now that is definitely.
Pretty pretty on the camera you can see.
It next to do you color correctors it is.
Very very light it's almost like white.
With just the tiniest little bit of pink.
Reflecting it so i'm very very worried.
To see how this is gonna look on the.
Face hopefully doesn't give like that.
Great cast that a lot of highlighters.
Give but let's go ahead and.
On nc okay so i don't know who thought.
Of applying highlighter with a cushion.
But this is definitely not the shape of.
Thing that you'd want to be applying.
Glow with i'm gonna go to my yet beauty.
Blender and tied up buns out a little.
Bit.
Honestly it does look pretty chalky and.
Blending in a highlighter with a cushion.
Definitely will not do that again.
Alright let me stop while i'm ahead.
Before i get too crazy and then end up.
Taking my entire makeup off from hating.
It so much this does not look awful i.
Really really like the color corrector.
It worked very very well for me even.
Though it was superduper light i really.
Like the foundation and i like the.
Concealer as well i guess it doesn't.
Really matter though because the.
Foundation and concealer were not really.
Part of this review but that's what it's.
Come to.
Now that the base is all complete i'm.
Gonna go into the other stuff off-camera.
So i'm gonna do my brows and my eyes and.
Then i'll come back for the lips and.
We're going to test out the lip cushions.
That are in this collection so i will be.
Right back alright so i just threw.
Together this pink glowy look i.
Absolutely love how this turns out this.
Looks really really pretty on camera as.
Well for everything i use the i love.
Sata ii x color pop collection and brand.
New when i use this shade over here.
Which is called heavy glam it is so.
Beautiful and very very primitive as you.
Can see i use it for the inner corners.
And my glow as well because laura knows.
That cushion highlighter was definitely.
Lacking but the last thing we have on.
Our list today is the lips so we have.
These three lip cushion shades right up.
In here you have this perfectly shape.
Which is called a bubble gum and.
Paradise this bright pink which is.
Called a doll so hard and then this.
Ready orange which is called melon like.
It is i'm definitely not filling the.
Bright pink or the bright purple so.
Today i'm gonna go with this ready.
Orange hope shade to hopefully a match.
Between my hoodie and the pink and the.
Inner corners i honestly have no idea to.
Be completely honest as soon as this.
Video is over i'm gonna replace it with.
A glossy lip for the insert and photo.
Anyway but obviously i want to finish.
The review for you guys let's go ahead.
And apply this one the melon like it is.
Oh so yes this is what it means by a.
Cushion laughs okay interesting.
This is strange.
These are supposed to dry down matt.
Watch it is definitely doing the firmly.
Honest thing is not awful if i'm looking.
In the mirror it definitely is a little.
Bit patchy and crocky i think that's.
Just because the applicator is.
Absolutely awful it's really hard to.
Give it like a precise line as you can.
See like over here i'm way outside of.
The lip line i've hired up over a lion.
As well and it is definitely not looking.
Even i don't know why a ball applicator.
Would ever be useful to anybody trying.
To get a precise lip line maybe it was.
Just like four really really really.
Quick like just a like padding type.
Action but definitely not for like the.
Serious makeup liquid lipstick wearer.
All right guys so does it look all.
Complete let's go back and recap.
Everything that we've tried out so far.
So as a reminder we were reviewing the.
Wet n wild mega cushion collection today.
We had four four color correctors a.
Highlight cushion and a contour cushion.
And then three lip cushions in this full.
Set color correctors they weren't.
Definitely pretty good they retail for a.
$5.99 each i really liked the green one.
And the orange one they did a very good.
Job of covering up my acne and my dark.
Circles my skin to look super even right.
Now and i am absolutely loving it.
Especially with the foundation as well.
Which was not cushion but definitely.
Will be used by me again.
That's aside from the point though the.
Purple and yellow color correctors i.
Definitely would skip how odd i'm not.
Saying they're bad by any means i.
Honestly did not even try them but i am.
Someone who has never ever used a purple.
Or yellow color corrector i personally.
Don't really see much of a point for.
Them as for the highlighting contour.
Shades these are definitely a bit more.
Of a miss for me.
The cons well honestly looked really.
Really pretty on my skin tone it blends.
Out pretty well once i use my beauty.
Blender but it was not that intense the.
Worst parts about is that was very very.
Light i have a spray tan right now and.
It barely showed up on me meaning for.
Anybody that's darker than me which is.
Like majority of the entire world.
Population it would not look very good.
It would probably would honestly look.
Like a highlighter shade and death was.
Obviously not the goal of a contour.
Cushion but that being said it worked.
For me what i recommend it may be it.
Definitely depends on your skin tone as.
For the highlighter this almost.
Definitely the worst fail of the.
Collection it just like a lighter.
Pigment.
I really didn't have much of like a high.
Lady glow once i finished off the look i.
Obviously packed on a ton of that pink.
Cinco shadow that i use in the.
Intercourse as well for the highlighter.
Because the highlighter was looking very.
Very chalky and definitely not doing it.
For me as was the three lip colors.
Economists you really really like the.
Formula they went on very very nicely.
They applied nicely they look nice they.
Feel nice the only part i wouldn't.
Recommend is the actual applicator of.
The lip cushions themselves the ball.
Applicator just really doesn't make a.
Whole lot of sense it's messy it's hard.
To get a good lip line i definitely.
Would not recommend but for $4.99.
Honestly just get it squeeze it on your.
Hand and then use a lip brush because i.
Really like these lip products after.
Looking at everything i honestly cannot.
Decide if this collection is a hit or.
Miss it's not very often that a group of.
Products is so evenly split like i feel.
Like there are a lot of really really.
Good products and there are also a lot.
Of things that i would literally never.
Use again so i'm like hardcore on the.
Fence right now definitely leave me a.
Comment down below and tell me what you.
Thought of each product have you used.
Cushion probably before let me know.
What's your favorite type of stuff let's.
Have a mice little sisters discussion in.
The comments down below because i'm.
Definitely open to the concept like.
Cushion foundation i would love to try.
It more in the future and definitely i.
Will keep you guys posted on what they.
Think but for the most part there are.
Some good things and some bad things so.
I definitely wanna hear what you guys.
