Spoilers in today's video i challenged.
My artists to team up with the biggest.
Names in beauty for an ultimate collab.

Tuesday uploads in between regular.
Episodes i thought i'd be really fun to.
Do a video inspired by the last.
Episode's challenge but because of copn.
19 and the stay at home orders a collab.
Challenge just isn't really possible or.
Is it so for today's video inspired by.
Inset influencer episode of 3 i am.
Wrangled together all my favorite.
Friends in the beauty community for a.
Virtual collab pretty much the biggest.

Our makeup routine make sure that you.
Did not click on for this video and you.
Watch all the way to the end because you.
May see it your favorite beauty guru.
Let's get started.
Music.
To start off this video today is one of.
The kindest and in my opinion most.
Talented artists in the beauty community.
She inspired me to get my channel.
Started and has always pushed me to take.
My content to the next level nikki.
You're up girl all right hi everybody it.
Is an honor to be here i hope you're.
Ready for all the glam that is about to.
Come at you because oh boy we've got.
Some stars lined up i am the first one.
To kick it off for you today and i am.
Doing foundation but the number one rule.
Before applying any foundation is.
Surprise because not true prime is a the.
Foundation i'll be wearing today is my.
Nars this right here is the natural.
Radiant foundation so how is everyone.
Holding up during this quarantine.
Madness and not just quarantine madness.
I'm talking 2020 madness a lot of you.
Guys know that earlier this year i came.
Out as transgender not by free will.
Unfortunately for the full story please.
Check out my video but if there's one.
Thing that 2020 has made very clear for.
Me is that there are so many good people.
Left in this world.
I know as beauty gurus face negativity.
Every single day we faced backlash every.
Single day but the moment i opened up.
And showed my vulnerable side and told.
You my truth the warmth and the love.
That i received was unmatched it was so.
Unreal and i cannot believe that i'm.
Living my truth so openly and freely and.
Feeling so loved by all of you and one.
Thing and that's why i'm really excited.
That we're doing this here today one.
Thing that has really helped me through.
The stress and the anxiety and just all.
Of it concerning my coming-out was.
Makeup makeup will always and forever be.
That one thing in my life that keeps me.
Grounded and is sort of like my coping.
Mechanism like if what i'm doing here.
Right now do my makeup is what keeps me.
Me honestly so i am so excited for the.
People that you're about to see on your.
Screen in this collab because they are.
Phenomenal stars and the fact that we as.
A group got together for this video is.
Exactly what 2020 needs all right so my.
Foundation is on and now it is time for.
Concealer and free concealer we're gonna.
Be moving along to our next star and not.
Just any star a star with three r's.
Please welcome the concealer and.
Bacon king of youtube patrick star here.

Thank you nikki good catch.
Alright guys of my section is concealer.
And baking i'm a little bit extra so i.
Like to take two concealers and two.
Powders for my face and let's just go.
Ahead and get sealers that i'm using is.
Mac studio finish at the benefit bling.
Concealer a cream and a liquid that's my.
Secret concoction for my face i know.
It's a little bit extra and it's not for.
Everyone.
But that's what works for me and other.
Tickets on a synthetic brush right here.
And painful battle alright guys this is.
The face that i'd love to highlight with.
I'm gonna go ahead and just blend that.
Out like so i just make sure you blend.
Shout out to james for instant.
Influencer i love what he's doing for.
The community it's a very beautiful.
Industry it's a very crazy industry but.
I think it's really meant to be and.
Speaking of industry i've been.
Discovering new talent on tik-tok and.
That's what i've been doing during my.
Quarantine and keeping me busy and away.
From the reality that we are living in.
Just to kind of get my mind off things.
Like i said the powder that i'm going to.
Use is my patrick starr powder that i.
Did with matt cosmetics i poured it onto.
A plate like pouring it onto a plate so.
I have more control just any ol plate.
I'm just baking right under the eye okay.
So last but not least for this step of.
The concealer i'm baking this airspun.
Powder is so thick so heavy it's a drag.
Queen staple if you ask me like to take.
This with my pub and you really just.
Warm up strength.
A little yoga okay all right guys that.
Concludes of my concealing and baking i.
Hope you guys learned some techniques.
From me to you so that's in this path of.
The makeup tutorial i'd love to.
Introduce a very fabulous dragon among.
All the beauty community the one and the.
Only nikita.
Dragon here you go    thanks p star.
Hi sisters it's nikita and today i'm.

Add a little blush because we look a.
Little scared right now.
Come on we need to look cute let's go.
Listen sisters warren teen has been so.
Crazy i'm gonna be honest you guys they.
Definitely have been going through it i.
Think you know even bad    have.
Feels as well and i feel like this is.
Just a moment to be extremely reflective.
And kind of pause i mean the world is on.
Pause so we all need to you know you.
Know i feel like i was humans and just.
In this crazy lifestyle we're so used to.
Being on to the next thing on to them.
What can i do more and just wanting to.
Be so rampant i think we never like slow.
Down and really look at all we have and.
I feel like it especially at this time.
We we kind of see how valuable just like.
Health is without even realizing it you.
Become so selfish you become so like oh.
My god what do i need oh my god i need.
To do this i need to do that but you.
Really don't need those things you know.
Like i said i think we're all kind of.
Going through it in a way and.
Reminiscing and replaying little moments.
Over and over again and i just want to.
Say to you guys stop it stop just as a.
Little reminder because i have been.
Driving myself crazy replaying all these.
Situations and moments let this at least.
Be a reminder to you a wake-up call the.
Girl every day is not guaranteed you.
Know that time that you went out and you.
Were scared to put on that outfit or.
That time you were scared to have that.
Moment    have the moment no regrets.
Music.
Okay and now for the undisputed special.
Effects queen miss glam and gore miss.
Mikey is about to show you guys how to.
Snatch your eyebrows i'm jealous because.
I clearly don't have any catch.
Thanks nikita let's find my eyebrows so.
I'm using katie d's super brow pomade to.
Start filling in.
Missing eyebrows you're probably.
Wondering what happened to my eyebrows.
And the truth is i lost them in a fight.
With squirrel is that but anyway in.
Quarantine i've been spending a lot of.
Time with my favorite creatures on earth.
That includes my boyfriend anthony been.
Getting to spend a lot of quality time.
With him which i really really really.
Enjoy and spending it with my dog ripley.
And my newest favorite creature in the.
House my new dog his name is creature.
Since creature is new to the world i've.
Been spending a lot of quarantine time.
Teaching him new tricks and trying to.
Teach my first dog how to adapt to our.
New dog there has never been a more.
Appropriate time to say this but i aim.
For sister's squirrels can't stop me now.
Okay i think it's time for eyeshadow so.
I will be passing at this palette on to.
The most super sister there is a man who.
Needs no introduction because it's his.
Channel no one the only james charles.
Thank you so much mikey.
Hello you guys james here of course of.
My mini palette let's just dive right.
Into the eyeshadow portion the one thing.
That has really been helping me get.
Through quarantine and keep a positive.
Attitude has honestly been watching a.
Lot of nude youtube content that is not.
Related to beauty since beauty is my job.
And i do it every day i really don't.
Watch that much beauty content on.
Youtube anyway but during this.
Quarantine i have been going deeper and.
Deeper into the depths of youtube and.
Watching a lot of content that you guys.
Probably never expect a few days ago i.
Actually put out a tweet saying i had.
Experienced new levels of boredom.
Because i spending my night watching.
Somebody play a sudoku puzzles on.
Youtube i discovered this puzzle channel.
On youtube called cracking it at the.
Cryptic and i have fallen in love with.
Their videos my absolute favorite.
Pastime in the entire world is doing.
Escape rooms but since the road is.
Obviously closed out i'm not able to do.
That so if you guys are fellow nerds.
Like me and you love solving puzzles i.
Would deathly recommend checking out.
Their channel i've also been watching an.
Alarming amount of minecraft videos i.
Would definitely recommend checking out.
Mumbo jumbo and also exhume avoid oh my.
God i almost forgot to mention to you.
Guys i have just recently got into a.
Survivor the tv show okay i know i'm.
Super super late in fact i'm 40 seasons.
Late but my friend caught me into this.
New season two winners at war and i have.
Become so addicted i'm literally ready.
To give up a month of my life and go.
Survive on a deserted island at this.
Point because it seems so far but i.
Haven't been watching.
The show literally non-stop you guys.
Should definitely leave me a comment.
Down below and let me know what you've.
Been watching to stay entertained it.
During this quarantine and helpful hint.
It better be it's the influencer alright.
That is the eyeshadow portion all.
Complete but as you guys can see we.
Still have a little bit left to go on.
The eyes and of course the rest of the.
Face so i'm gonna grab a fresh pair of.
Lillie lashes and i'm gonna hand them to.
Somebody who could always make me smile.
No matter what i'm going through and it.
Was also taught me that even though this.
Is my job it's okay to have fun i never.
Take life too seriously and most.
Importantly it to be a bad    well.
Duh baddest brooklyn here you go since.
You guys are probably so bored watching.

Trying my hardest to the place anytime i.
Have to go to the store i don't i make.
