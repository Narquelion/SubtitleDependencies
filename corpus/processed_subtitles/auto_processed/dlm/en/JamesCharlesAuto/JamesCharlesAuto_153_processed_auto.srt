Hi sisters and jacob charles here and.
Welcome back to our youtube channel.
00 in the morning and.
You're probably wondering james why do.
You keep filling youtube videos this.
Early i'm also wondering the same thing.
For today's video we were going on a.
Road trip i wish i never did that oh my.
God.
Today we together are going to be going.
On a little bit of a road trip i am so.
Beyond excited because we're you going.
Somewhere very very special and for.
Today's video i'm going to be doing a.
Full face of makeup using makeup that i.
Am about to make so i've been evita guru.
For about three very very long years at.
This point and thanks to you guys i've.
Actually been able to turn up pinenut.
Makeup into a full-time job and i still.
Pinch myself every single day at this.
Point you guys see me pretty much to.
Every single makeup look in the book.
From classic everyday glam to crazy.
Rainbow avant-garde realness but even.
Though my job is to play with these.
Makeup products and create art with them.
On my face i really don't know that much.
About what actually goes in to making.
Makeup so for today's video i thought.
It'd be a really really fun and.
Educational to go behind the scenes and.
I partnered with colour-pop cosmetics a.
Brand that you and i obviously know and.
Love and we're going to taking a.
Hour-long road trip over to oxnard.
California literally in the middle of.
Nowhere but that is where their.
Laboratory is located luckily after a.
Whole lotta convincing colour-pop was.
Kind enough to let me and my entire.
Camera crew go behind the scenes and.
Show you guys what actually goes on in.
These labs and we're going to be making.
A full face of makeup setting the.
Foundation that anyway lip gloss and.
Hopefully we'll be able to come up with.
A really really beautiful look and the.
End and give you guys a little bit more.
Information on the products that we're.
All using every single day we have a.
Very long car ride and day ahead of us.
So i'm going to quickly go hop in the.
Shower and get ready for the day this.
Bed head is not cute but i am so beyond.
Excited for what's to come so without.
Further ado let's go make some makeup.
Music.
Three seconds in i already just stepped.
In mud it's off to a rough start ladies.
Music.
We're all so excited she had right in.
Let's do it afterwards basically we own.
Like nine buildings like oh this is.
Gorgeous.
Hello feed me it seriously obviously i.
Do makeup every single day as a job but.
Like i've never really been a part of.
Like the actual production process for.
And like school came pretty easy to me.
About science and math or i to like.
Favorite subjects of all time i actually.
Really liked chemistry so i'm like.
Excited today.
Loke a little bit to like learn more.
About it and like see what actually goes.
Into the products that i use on an.
Everyday basis yeah all those food.
Stations they are like so prep they're.
Ready.
How long is called mob-like been around.
And manufacturing here so it started.
Maybe like five six years ago as like a.
Little idea.
So spats lavatories used to like.
Manufacture for like all the big makeup.
Brands that you know of and the owners.
Now draw more.
Over there decided like why don't we.
Just launched our own brands like we.
Know how to make up no they like came up.
With the idea of color pop they.
Literally like used to have their office.
In like a closet so it was like this.
Tiny little room and they would like go.
Make the makeup and they like pack the.
Order and then they'd like drive it to.
The post office oh my god those muscley.
Grown from like a tiny little like.
Closet to this full-on like nine.
Building facility yeah that's everything.
So color pop manufactures everything.
Right here in california in the us so.
Just like one of the major selling.
Points i feel like for a collar pop.
Makeup having everything in house means.
Things are faster so if a trend comes.
Out later that day like the lab will.
Have samples for us.
Oh my biggest thing i'm working with any.
Brian is i'm very very impatient someone.
I want to do that like well let's take.
Us stefan's like i want it now so who.
Does it so fast it'll be right there.
Yeah like literally we've done overnight.
So i feel like one of the other major.
Selling points of color pop is the.
Prices are very very low on most of the.
Products yeah and that's because.
Everything's in-house right so like we.
Literally like down to like a little.
Plastic mold that's right here - yeah.
That's so cool well i'm really excited.
Let's get a quick sister snack and then.
Head over to the lab.
Music.
Music.
So i think we should go in the same.
Order that i would do my normal routine.
Then just to keep everything organized.
So i could like figure it out inside so.
I usually start my own foundation the.
Foundation is pretty much fixed it looks.
Like four different pigments that we.
Have white block and then red and yellow.
So it's not easy and colegrove has one.
Of the biggest changes no foundation.
Ever when i cover every single skin from.
Out there right right when i have like.
Every single shape or every single.
Person itself right i feel like home.
Does a really good job of that and i.
Think because it's all done in-house -.
People always love to say like oh it's.
Really hard to formulate sort and shade.
So when it's all done right here you're.
Watching the entire process go down so.
You get to actually make it happen okay.
Let's figure out how to mix my shades.
Together.
Number one primary color is the white in.
The white okay so about how much do you.
Think i should add just a poor gram for.
How much is four grams okay so you're.
Gonna point out oh oh.
That's point four so two for milli 42.
Different shades bonus the face and then.
From there which is create alright so.
Like how like what goes into actually.
Differentiating every single shade it's.
Just literally just mixing the other.
Different pigments and hoping for the.
Best.
Discard a bit too much okay today i.
Usually can't match on carnations anyway.
So nothing will be different okay so one.
More round.
Heavier than others see pop this one.
Senator discusses bigger one.
Oh yeah it's crazy because the littlest.
Little drop will actually nod to it.
Killick may be point zero - that's good.
It's just the eye shadow once you add.
Too much barker going back like that oh.
My gosh that one drop will change the.
Entire color - science is crazy.
Well then that looks like skin tone oh.
My gosh that's me.
Maybe according to my foundation at home.
Can i not skin tone no will i make it.
Work yes it's only for pigment for all.
The browns who say oh we didn't formally.
Any dark shades it's too hard you heard.
It right here folks take fine then it's.
Make it hop in it's not so hard to be.
Inclusive this is so squirt it in there.
That was literally so easy let's do it.
So our concealers already pre-mixed i'm.
Just gonna be killing it and my little.
Vial today it kind of odd.
I guess not this show is really really.
Easy but what is like the difference in.
Formulation when it comes to concealer.
Because the form a little bit different.
Really different yeah completely deaf we.
Add more pigments the load of the.
Pigments is higher can we have more.
Coverage in the mother what is this hole.
That's a wiper wiper it's just we shove.
It on there there you go a good dough.
Fight well man that's so easy yeah yeah.
Hello i picked an egg bagel before the.
First two steps of a retainer literally.
All complete full coverage moment this.
Is probably a better match than the.
Foundation will be let's be real pale.
And sad but good so what we do we have.
Our base formula which consists of.
Pretty much like cushion powders mmm and.
Then we have our fighters and we have.
Our pigment and then we have our liquid.
So different from foundation a lot alike.
The bronzers blushes and highlighters.
Are a powder base correct as opposed to.
Like a liquid right so then that's when.
The pressing comes in because limpopo.
Powders are mixed together then you.
Press and get into a pan yeah okay cool.
So that's what we're doing today okay.
We're gonna do afternoon delight okay.
That's a great color for me so then.
There's similar to the foundation.
There's like a different way that goes.
Into each thing yeah so pretty much what.
You want to do with.
Your spatula you're gonna spread it out.
Evenly over like the chunks out yeah try.
To keep the palak look your bike they're.
Not really clear montage it's like would.
That be good for crossing yes that's.
Good okay fun we just let me slide it.
Right in here.
We lost a little bit of powder we can.
Actually fix that a little bit with the.
Psi so what this does this compresses.
The powders right so since we lost a.
Little bit we can actually press it.
Lower so i looked a little bit fuller oh.
That's good god i've never forgotten so.
Do you want to do this yeah okay so just.
Crank this down right here.
Like that well of the club popper.
Blizzard paul proof you need that when.
You're working with me oh my god nothing.
Little yay this is so this is a brother.
No it's normally a most thing i didn't.
Drop of it onto the floor and then it's.
Bluffs pretty much the same thing -.
Let's do it just once again mixing all.
The pigments together yeah so like okay.
So for example for me i usually like.
More like peachy orange ii types of.
Gloss for my skin tones that would just.
Be adding more yellow paper yeah yellow.
And then an eyeshadow well right because.
You don't want to put on the blush and.
Have it literally take over your entire.
Face so if it's less pigment than what.
Would be the other ingredients that are.
In there so powders that are in your.
Base it contains a lot more of less than.
Your pigment when we have a lot of.
Liquids in it.
Sometimes you have to decrease because.
Then we have talked about it with techno.
Keep it in there this time and this.
One's a little bit okay i'm definitely.
Just gonna happen it's a little bit.
Harder around a thousand a thousand five.
Hundred and fifteen hundred like there.
You know everything you know for example.
The bronzer and the blush you like how.
It's fluffy.
Yeah a week said i kept requesting it oh.
So heartless yeah cuz i know you see how.
It looks a little bit it's a little you.
Have okay so for the next time i would.
Have pressed it a lot harder with about.
Higher psi to make sure it's more in the.
Pan yes sister you press it again so.
We're not gonna press it they got okay.
Lesson learned so for next time i would.
Press this a little bit harder to make.
Sure it's in the pan one okay that's.
Cool so different formulas definitely.
Require a different amount of attention.
So speaking of pilot or now that we're.
Done with faith products let's get our.
Glow so now we're moving needs lighter.
So women ii have some pieces fed okay.
We're gonna do which is gonna put it.
You're gonna put it under this pressure.
You're gonna prep and see how this.
Already into really nice and low.
Put her into one of these so that we.
Really have eliminates are you just.
Gonna pretend to do this magnet and.
We're just gonna make sure there is.
First of all that is really fun and this.
Is how we make every single one of our.
Highlighters out there in production but.
So what goes into like the making of a.
Highlighter for you as opposed to a.
Normal shop it's on there somewhere when.
It's giving you this long is this say.
Depends on the size of the throw that.
You want to use there's one like a.
Really high glitter effect right we're.
Gonna be looking for a larger a lot.
Bigger in a defense of the under color.
Of the pie night as well okay cool.
One of the common issues that i feel are.
Highlighters is that when you put on a.
Highlighter and it doesn't really match.
Your skin tone sometimes the faith.
You'll see like that gray calcium or if.
It's like a letter 1 euro be darker.
That's when the base is not right for.
The skin tone and i'm not in the baby.
All in the colors it's all a little rule.
It's all whatever the pigment that you.
Use seen said it's making you look wait.
Okay yeah and that's one of the things.
That we have to work on there right yeah.
Well we take it for a ballet show with.
Pd they're like oh it looks kind of grey.
On my skin right so we have to get rid.
Of the photo about tweaking the cause.
And every painter new for me make sure.
That it works on all skin tone it.
Doesn't get by a great car yeah probably.
You're ready yeah.
Into the walk literally already this is.
So pretty hello oh i'm just gonna put.
Down there the pressure okay.
I'm just gonna just press all the way.
Down we thought she already has been.
Ordered on a job yeah so you're gonna.
Remove so i'll push it out push it up so.
Already has glue on it okay because the.
Magnet will do that for you oh my god.
That's so cool can i just rub it over oh.
Who is way stronger than i expected.
It is slide it to the side hey you go.
And i was on there yep oh my gosh.
Try watching a good sister swat let's.
See oh my god.
Hello that's the prettiest other that's.
One of our number one yeah i could see.
Yeah look at it to the collection things.
Perfect oh my gosh okay okay let's move.
On to the next step so for all the plans.
We made so far today of course we're.
Doing the classic color pop fertilize.
That we all know and love and that i.
Love so many times but we didn't want to.
Do at least one thing custom not a.
Half-bad so i'm gonna be making a custom.
Gloss today hopefully we're gonna be.
That it looks good but i wanted to make.
Like a kind of like pinky peachy light.
New shade like a go-to everyday new it's.
Pretty much the same thing here what are.
You i want like a peachy pink for like.
Leading school we more towards pink and.
Peachy so therefore there should be more.
Red you're gonna add more red then.
Yellow i want less yellow right maybe.
Not that much like that cuz we're gonna.
Find out is there reasoning behind.
Putting the block in there what does it.
Do it's not gonna be too bright okay so.
Like how to mute the down a lot on that.
Like that much i think that's like.
You're not that so like literally one.
Like extra little crumb of bonding your.
Entire color is wrong it makes a huge.
Impact oh i would be messing up.
Lipsticks left and right here so we have.
My powders all mixed together mo now we.
Need to add at the liquid base that.
Makes it a glob so good enough to wet.
The pigments.
I just grind it together yeah you just.
Okay kinda fun kind of down oh that's a.
Good actual color we're just gonna be.
Like adding your pigments in here don't.
Put your hand in there.
Ya don't want to lose anything so i'm.
Just gonna pour it right over top of.
Here oh my god this is what i always see.
In those instagram videos oh my god i so.
Excited wait what is this work just for.
You to get and then we pass it three.
Times ready yes this is literally those.
Instagram paint mixing videos i watched.
Those four hours okay now you're gonna.
Mix it so once you pass it through three.
Times it gets like that guys it's my lip.
Gloss so now that suppose right under.
Here yeah i love these syringes kind of.
I'm not gonna lie this is just the.
Plastic colourpop lip - oh my god there.
It is that's a lip color oh my god.
That's my gloss hello that's so cool i.
Just made this you all just watch that.
Happen comforter on yeah that's.
Everything i like the best.
Well i'm probably really good at that's.
Probably it should do this as a job.
Maybe perhaps okay yep let's do it.
Alright so we literally just finished.
Baking almost my entire maker routine in.
One hour we to sit i have a rethink all.
Right here in-house custom made this is.
So incredibly cool but we do have one.
Product left remaining and that is going.
To be of course the eyebrows the eyebrow.
Pencils are actually many parts in a.
Different building on the same facility.
So we're gonna head it right over there.
Right now so we can get my brows on.
Fleek what is that.
Dear down down gotta keep everything.
Sister sanitary.
Music.
Music.
Music.
Okay we do the same repetitive.
Music.
Uh-huh oh please please get the dog yes.
Applause.
Just press this one and this one.
Together and then the bread.
I bet this is fully realized okay nobody.
Okay so obviously this is my first time.
Doing that but you're like it i start up.
The brows how many do produce and like.
An hour and hour.
A day and all of the other hand yes that.
Is so cool.
Well i'll be taking one my videos that i.
Thought i'm doing brother this but i.
It's so cool oh good around the assembly.
Line now all right sisters that is our.
Lab day aw complete we literally just.
Made every single product of our makeup.
Routine and only a few hours that was so.
Crazy and so cool to see everything here.
In person obviously i'll put a link up.
Every single day we're getting to.
Actually see how hands-on it is i think.
Everybody involved from the start to the.
End is such a cool amazing process.
Definitely has my wheels turning i'm.
Feeling very very inspired right now but.
That is of course for the future for.
Right now i'm gonna take off my lab coat.
Oh and my hair and we're gonna head home.
And actually do my makeup now using all.
The makeup that's i made all these.
Sisters we are back for the lab and i.
Have here my little bag of diy makeup.
Products that i made today i am so.
Beyond excited to actually put them on i.
Had so much fun learning and seeing the.
Behind the scenes process literally.
Everything was so cool so let's put on.
The makeup and a talk about everything.
Started sorry makeup today i of course.
Like to go to my foundation first always.
So i'm gonna grab the color pop no.
Filter foundation in the shade me.
Okay i'm gonna pray that this color is.
Like a somewhat decent match.
Music.
Fedil too much yellow i literally had an.
Entire team of professionals who do this.
Every single day to help me with this.
And i still managed to make my shade.
Wrong my disappointed yes surprised.
Absolutely not probably my favorite part.
Of the entire day today was actually the.
Foundation process just because i.
Defined chemistry to be very very.
Interesting and thing that actually goes.
Into like foundation is really really.
Cool over the past three years i've.
Tried probably hundreds of foundations.
At this point but i've only really found.
A few that actually really really worked.
For me and my skin which is so crazy.
Because pretty much every major brand at.
This white house the foundation line out.
Or is working on one and it seems like.
Always just foundation but you guys saw.
The imagining out the ingredients today.
And literally one wrong.
Drop of either pigmentation or color or.
Liquid or ingredient and the entire.
Batch would be completely wrong and.
Could actually ruin the entire.
Formulation so it's actually so cool to.
See what goes into the first step of the.
Makeup process in order to even out all.
Of our skin tones although there are so.
Many ingredients and processes that go.
Into making complexion products probably.
My favorite part of the entire day today.
We'll see how easy it was to actually.
Mix together different pigments to make.
Different shades one of the biggest.
Problems in the makeup community whether.
You want to admit it or not is racism.
And unfortunately that is not a topic.
That i am a stranger to but all that was.
A nightmare at the time my old tweets.
Being brought back up and me being held.
Accountable for them oxy was probably.
One of the best things that ever.
Happened to me it's truly changed the.
Person that i am today for the better.
And it's made me realized that i have a.
Platform of a lot of people watching me.
And of course they want to use that.
Platform for good and i want to educate.
On behalf of issues that are really.
Really important and shade range is.
Definitely one of those topics i feel.
Like they're vetted quite a lot of.
Foundation line launches within the past.
Few years with shave ranges that can.
Only be described as like just really.
Really embarrassing and one of the.
Excuses that big brands always seem to.
Get when it comes to the issue is oh my.
God it's so much harder to formulate the.
Darker shades because we don't want to.
Get the undertones wrong and as a.
Consumer as someone who has never really.
Been involved with the making of that.
Process i am definitely ashamed to say.
That i've kind of fallen for that but.
After seeing it behind the scenes there.
Is literally no excuse there's four.
Pigments add some more black add some.
More red add some more yellow make it.
Work you saw here today folks it's.
Apparently.
Hard to be inclusive and i'm gonna let.
You in on a little bit of a sister.
Secret and of course i don't speak for.
Anybody here but people of color would.
Probably be really excited to see their.
Shade range represented and it's a web.
Win situation for a business when you're.
Actually selling products i just thought.
I'd put that out there all right sorry a.
Rant over faces all on i just said it in.
Place and now let's move on to it.
Chiseling this out getting nice and it's.
Not i'm just gonna grab miami 405 brush.
And dip into the custom bronzer shade.
That i made so for the bronzer and blush.
I actually found the whole egg pressing.
Process to be really really cool clearly.
I struggled a little bit with getting.
Everything together and not spilling it.
On the floor but you know what.
Is my first time accidents do happen i.
Was actually so surprised because i did.
Not realize that these processes were.
All done by hand i really really thought.
We were gonna be walking into the lab.
And there's gonna be like 80 million.
Conveyor belts and machines all pressing.
And packing and mixing things together.
But almost every single one of the.
Products that i was part of the process.
But today are actually all handmade in.
The factory every single day by.
Hard-working employees i think that is.
So cool so next time moving onto my.
Brows i made the shade at brunette today.
And i'm just going to fill in my brows.
Like normal mmm that is a good brow tee.
I also really really love the process of.
Making the eyebrow pencils too and let.
Me tell you why obviously it was a whole.
Lot different than all the chemistry and.
Ingredients and formulations that were.
Going on in the other love but when i.
Was a young kid i used to be obsessed.
With the mechanics and figuring out how.
Things worked my dad was a self-employed.
Contractor when i was growing up and one.
Of the reasons he was super popular in.
My town for jobs was that because he was.
Actually able to do so many of the jobs.
Involved everything from the design work.
To the actual construction and building.
To the plug into the electricity like he.
Truly was a jack-of-all-trades which is.
Definitely inspired my work ethic today.
I always loved going to job with him.
Because of the fact that i got to sit.
There and figure out how things were.
Made and how things worked.
I love mechanics and pulleys and levers.
I was obsessed with cords i don't know.
How i never got electrocuted i had a.
Very very strange obsession with vacuum.
Cleaners don't ask because i literally.
Have no idea but i.
Found that realm very very interesting.
So seeing the machines and the.
Mechanisms that actually put the brow.
Pencils together was so cool for me not.
Even gonna lie even though there was.
Machine involved once again though.
Almost all completely done by hand no.
Robots real human beings working at.
These stations producing up to i think.
2,000 brow pencils in a day which i.
Think is so incredibly cool so moving on.
To the next step which of course is.
Going to be my eye shadow i'm just gonna.
Throw it and look quickly using the.
Colour-pop and give it to me straight.
Eyes shadow palette i did not formulate.
One of these in labs today just because.
I'm already familiar with the process so.
I just thrown this for cut crease a.
Moment i haven't done one in a hot.
Minute now really liking how this is.
Turning out but obviously i have a whole.
Entire eyelid that i want to fill up so.
I'm gonna grab this super shock shadow.
That i created today at the lab and pop.
It on there i'm just gonna pop this.
Shader right on the lid oh wow that's.
Pretty and i'm quickly just gonna pop on.
A winged liner just to finish off the.
Eye look oh my god that eyeliner is is.
Eight inches thick i'm so scared of that.
Way oh my god keeps getting thicker this.
Is the worst eyeliner wing i've ever.
Done in my entire makeup history oh my.
God how did this happen.
Oh my god if i take it off it's just.
Gonna get messier so usually when a look.
Isn't going exactly as planned i'll just.
Like pop on a lot and it'll fix all my.
Problems that's not happening today but.
It's not the makeups fault it's mine i.
Don't know how i got to 9 million.
Subscribers but alas my makeup is done.
And i'm ready to move on to the rest of.
The phase the next type of my routine is.
Of course going to be my highlighter i.
Need to get my glow on because i'm.
Looking a little bit a lot right now i'm.
Gonna use my super shocked highlighter.
That i created with color palette today.
And i am so excited i was actually.
Really excited to learn more about.
Highlighter and what goes into making it.
Just because i think it's that last step.
That we all know and love and appreciate.
I mean like who doesn't love a good glow.
But i was actually so curious to see.
Like what goes into the formulation of a.
Highlighter does it really like there.
Are so many ways that i'd like a.
Highlighter has to perform and all at.
The same time like i was saying at the.
Lab if the base color isn't right then.
It can either look gray or orange.
Depending on the person's skin tone but.
While doing that when you turn it has to.
Reflect on the light and look shine.
There are different pearl sizes you can.
Either have like a tiny little pearl for.
A subtle everyday woman on the goat.
Book low or you can have an intense.
Blinding and glittery glow which you all.
Know that i definitely uh i definitely.
Get similar to foundation that one thing.
Going wrong can literally change the.
Entire formula and either make it look.
So beautiful or so bad which feels like.
It's like a high-risk situation i mean.
It's literally just creating a.
Highlighter but kind of some funny brush.
So the last of my makeup routine today.
Is of course going to be in the lipid e.
Du das that i'm gonna use my cousin.
Gloss in a second but first i need to.
Start off by lining them so i'm just.
Gonna use my favorite lip liner of all.
Time which happens to be from colour-pop.
With this one is not mine this is.
Actually the shade of curvy and.
Collaboration with karen i love saada ii.
Not mine but wish it was because this is.
Literally the best lip liner color ever.
And carrodus my all-time favorite people.
In the makeup community and last but.
Finally not least right over top of that.
Lip liner i'm gonna pop on my custom.
Ultra glossy lip that i created today i.
Wanted just a perfect peachy nude.
Leaning more towards pink than orange.
And this is what i came up with oh he.
Didn't really mean to make the lip in.
The eyeshadow be like a perfect match.
Today but i'm gonna pretend like i did.
Because it kind of looks really good and.
Fresh let's finish it off with some.
Sisters head its prey.
Alright sisters and that is my full face.
Of makeup that i made all complete i had.
So much fun getting my hands dirty and.
Working behind the scenes today with.
Collar pop to really see what goes into.
Actually making a make a problem from.
The start to finish i mean we get to.
Layer these products every single day.
And we all use them to feel beautiful.
And confident but there's actually so.
Much of a process that goes into it so.
Many amazing workers chemists scientists.
Assembly line people and major sound to.
Them and to color pop for allowing me it.
To be educated and i hope you guys.
Learned a little bit as well i am so.
Thankful that i got to experience a.
Whole behind the scenes process that i.
Will definitely never forget it and who.
Knows maybe i'll be part of it one day.
That is all i have for you today guys i.
