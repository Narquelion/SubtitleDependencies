Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel so if.
You saw in last week's video which if.
You have not you should definitely click.
Somewhere up here and check it out i did.
An unboxing a free makeup that beauty.
Gurus game video and i opened all sorts.
Of wonky products all the new releases.
Seemed so good and i was absolutely.
Dying to try them out and of course.
Today just two days after filming that.
Last video i opened my door this morning.
And there are about 50 new pr packages.
Waiting for me.
They couldn't have came two days earlier.
To be in the free pr video but you know.
I would regarding to what we've got for.
Today today i wanted to sit down i've.
Got a new makeup that is all fresh off.
The shelves we have a new primer a new.
Foundation a new highlighter and a new.
Eyeshadow palette so a ton of great new.
Products that i am so excited to try and.
Honestly all turned out really really.
Good spoiler alert so i did this warm.
Tone a pop of color crease that you guys.
Have all been asking me to film a.
Tutorial on i posted a pic on my answer.
A few days ago and y'all went crazy and.
I did do this look using the new anasazi.
A subculture eye palette and it turned.
Out so freakin good.
So if you want to see how i created this.
Makeup look right here using all new.
Products and first impressions make sure.
You keep on watching alright so before i.
Go into the actual foundation i'm gonna.
First go into my benefit porefessional.
New pore minimizing makeup now in the.
Last video if you guys have not checked.
It out yet definitely go watch it it is.
A pr unboxing video but i got three of.
These and i thought that this was like a.
Three-step process but my dumbass failed.
To realize that there's actually three.
Different shades not three different.
Steps so i grabbed shade number two and.
I'm going to put this on and see how it.
Works hopefully we'll be minimizing my.
Pores because i could use it alright so.
I guess this product is not technically.
A foundation it just as its pore.
Minimizing makeup i'm not really sure.
What that technically makes it as but if.
I look close up in the mirror my pores.
Honestly do look really really good they.
Don't look like completely cover.
Obviously there's gonna be nothing that.
I can put on my face that's kind of.
Completely go into my pores.
Unfortunately for me and for everybody.
Else out there but definitely they do.
Look pretty pretty balm and looking at.
The monitor as well my skin definitely.
Has like a blurred effect so i think i.
Actually really really like this product.
But let's see how actually layer.
Underneath foundation okay so furcal and.
Ations they were actually using a brand.
New at first impressions product and.
That is the smashbox to do skin is.
Shaping foundation it is a dual ended.
Foundation stick with one end being.
Foundation's and wanted being a contour.
Stick so.
I am super super excited to try these.
Out i've heard really really good things.
About them and i did actually get to.
Test use this a very very very long time.
Ago with matchbox and i was in love with.
It then so this is not really a first.
Impressions for like a second.
Impressions but i think it'll be good.
Hopefully i grab the shade of 1.2 which.
Looking at it on my face is definitely a.
Little bit too yellow and i know people.
Love to comments like my foundation it.
Doesn't match my neck thank you i am.
Well aware of the fact that i like to.
Use a more tan foundation than my.
Skintone i think i get so many comments.
About it and it is definitely something.
That i am aware of and do on purpose so.
Thank you so much for your concern but.
I'm gonna be using this shade today and.
It is definitely yellow and i'm.
Recognizing that right now so please.
Don't comment about it aside for the.
Fact that this foundation stick is.
Nowhere near the right color for me i.
Actually really really like how it looks.
On my face it is definitely way too.
Yellow but i'm gonna even it out with.
Some concealer so far so good.
Before i go into any concealer i'm gonna.
Quickly cream contour my face using the.
Other end of the foundation stick this.
Is saying that i definitely don't like.
Doing very often i definitely before.
Contouring with powders however for the.
Sake of this video obviously i want to.
Give the product a fair shot and a full.
On review so i'm going to cream contour.
Just the slightest bit alright so this.
Is definitely blending out really really.
Well as you can see it does not take a.
Lot of effort at all and it runs really.
Really nice the end of the skin.
Obviously no one wants to sit there.
Pouncing a beauty blender into their.
Freaking cheek for 30 minutes trying to.
Blend out a cream product so it looks.
Good and this is definitely going out in.
A pretty little effort which is awesome.
And i do like the color of this as well.
It's definitely like a contour and.
Bronzing at the same time which is a.
Great and definitely a time saver as.
Well that's kind of how i like to do my.
Contour slash bronzer in the first place.
I really don't do them separately.
They're kind of like one baking process.
Free and that's how i really do like it.
So i definitely i'm liking this.
Foundation stick a lot i'm gonna try to.
Fix up my skin tone a little bit using.
The tarte shape tape and light i do not.
Get any new concealers in my pr packages.
Although color pop i know just came out.
With new concealers and i'm dying to try.
Those so definitely let me know if you.
Guys nothing to do a video review on.
Those once i get them in the mail with.
My luck they'll probably come in like 20.
Minutes.
As i'm felling this video after i.
Already had my shape tape on but.
Whatever it will make it work another.
Time the actual color of the foundation.
Definitely looks a lot better now that.
I've lined it up my concealer and i'm of.
Course it's gonna set it really lightly.
In place using my laura mercier.
Translucent setting powder all right so.
It's called my face today i'm gonna.
Using the brand new makeup forever.
Artist face color.
Single little thing and this is in the.
Shade asked one one two and as i talked.
About in last week's video this has a.
Very very special place in my heart.
Because sister caste want my best.
Friends in the entire world.
Did actually work with makeup forever on.
Creating these shadows and bringing them.
All together to create a little bit of a.
Trio so i'm gonna be using her three.
Shades today to sculpt and make my face.
Look beautiful this contour sheet is.
Definitely very very cool tool because.
Sister cassie is more on the pale side.
And she has a more like pink undertone.
But this honestly looks really really.
Good on my skin it doesn't look grey or.
Like ashley in any way shape or form it.
Got fleas like a very very good like.
Cheek bone or like bone shadow type of.
Color it looks like very very natural.
And chiseled out i really like this for.
Blush today i'm gonna grab the maker.
Forever artists face color blush in the.
Shade of b 402 now as you can see this.
Is bright ass orange so i'm only gonna.
Use a very very little bit of this but.
You guys do know that i love orange.
Blush a lot and oh my god this is very.
Very very pigmented which is a good.
Thing but also a scary thing oh my god.
I'm just gonna really really lightly.
Table something that's a lot of blush.
This is not what i want this is not what.
I planned and i just gotta say i do not.
Understand something is really something.
Is orange something is really wrong.
Someone is literally playing music.
Outside my window so loud right now for.
No reason at all i'm getting so annoyed.
And now their sirens of course what else.
Could go wrong i just did my brows.
Off-camera you guys to see me do it so.
Many times now no point in trying the.
Same exact process and now for the eye.
Shadow we have the star of the show.
Don't do the on assad's you get.
Subculture eyeshadow palette i am so.
Excited for this this is actually not.
Featured in my last video and i did.
Feature the anasazi liquid glow.
Highlighters which we will be using in a.
Little while as well i just got this in.
The mail a few minutes ago before i.
Started filming and i tweeted and so.
Many of you guys wanted to see this now.
For the actual i look i was planning on.
Doing this cut crease the pop of color.
Left a few days ago on my instagram.
Everybody was freaking out they loved it.
Everybody asked for a tutorial so i was.
Gonna film not to me but this.
Like i said just got here a few minutes.
Ago everyone's like oh my god you have.
To use subculture so i am warning you.
Now i'm gonna be using the more classic.
Colors from this palette not the boring.
Ones at all because i feel like this is.
Gonna be so beautiful but there's.
Obviously like this teal tone the green.
At the bronze ii shade and the electric.
Chartreuse as well so i will not be.
Using those shades so please let me know.
If you want to actually see a more.
In-depth advanced tutorial using this.
Palette but for today's that i'm going.
To use any more classic warm tone shades.
I apologize for that but you guys asked.
For this i first gotta grab my anasazi.
Angled brush number seven and dip into.
The shade of fudge and start sketching.
Out my crease.
Oh wow that is what we like to call it.
Ladies and gentlemen pigmented so cut.
Crease is releasing that i've done a lot.
On my channel and they are by far my.
Favorite makeup look to do i just love.
The look of a good cut snatched crease.
And this is the technique that i used to.
Do them i always get questions about it.
Because it is only a unique technique.
But i always start off by drawing at the.
Bottom of the crease line with an angle.
Brush just to define it in and then.
Blend upwards afterwards i'm gonna.
Centigram eye makeup shakti 63 brush and.
Dipped into a little bit more fudge and.
I'm just gonna buff out that line a.
Little bit now normally when it comes to.
These eye looks beauty guru is never.
Even touch the brushes that actually.
Come in the palette but i am gonna grab.
This one today on the fluffier and and.
Different edition new wave which is this.
Like very mac and cheese orange e yellow.
Shade it's so beautiful and i'm just.
Gonna use this to blend that out oh my.
God these shadows are so beyond.
Pigmented.
Oh my god it is no secret to anybody.
That anasazi always kills it with the.
Pigmentation in their shadows but oh my.
God these are real good nice carving my.
Morphe r43 brush i'm gonna dip into the.
Shade all-star and i'm gonna use that to.
To find out that crease again i'm gonna.
Grab my makeup shakti 63 brush once.
Again and dip into the shade of roxy and.
I'm gonna use that to blend together the.
Fudge transition shade and the all-star.
Pinky shade if that makes sense.
This is looking so messy for some reason.
There's definite looking a little bit.
More wonky than my normal crease and i.
Really don't know why exactly but you.
Know what we're just gonna keep going.
And hope that it looks good by the end.
Of this to finish off the shadow portion.
Of this crease i'm going to grab my.
Angled brush once again and dip it to.
The tiniest little bit of the shade.
Rowdy and they're just going to carve it.
Out one last time.
For some reason that was one of the.
Hardest cut creases i've ever had to do.
I don't know why normally i can fly.
Through them so easily but today i'm.
Having an off day i guess whatever it.
Looks pretty decent now so i guess.
They're gonna go ahead and move on and.
For the pop of color liner today i'm.
Gonna be using the lime cryin liquid.
Liner in the shade sit truth you.
Definitely ought to be super super.
Careful at this step as well because.
Especially when it comes to colored.
Liner they're usually very very drying.
So if you do mess up its gonna be a very.
Very very hard to fix your mistakes like.
I have made several times throughout.
Doing this type of look so just be.
Careful please to do my wayne leonard.
Today i'm gonna use my tried-and-true.
And that is the kat von d tattoo liner.
In the shade it trooper.
This is definitely a much bigger waiting.
That i wanted to go forward today but i.
Guess it's just one of those days oh my.
God i forgot to blend out their cream.
Contour underneath my lab for my lower.
Lash and i first gonna grab my fudge on.
My morphe r43 brush and just buff that.
Into the lower lash line then i'm gonna.
Grab the other end of the anasazi brush.
That comes in the palette and i'm gonna.
Grab the show you a new wave and just.
Buff out that color to line my water.
Then i'm gonna use the nyx wonder pencil.
In the shade light actually helps to.
Open your eyes up and make your eyes.
Look huge in fact almost every single.
Time i wear a cut crease with a white.
Liner in my waterline i always get so.
Many comments feeling wide you facing.
Your eyes to be bigger and i'm like girl.
About everything else on my entire face.
Is too soon except my eye shape why is.
That even a concern so wonky and for the.
Last day i'm gonna pop on the house.
Luscious iconic lashes i know that in my.
Last video i did get a package from lily.
Lashes and i use the miami's but i feel.
Like iconic lashes like the absolute.
Necessity last when it comes to a cut.
Crease they just look so beautiful and.
So stunning and i did just get a new.
Package of these like 20 minutes ago.
Once again i was totally so annoyed for.
Some reason of course every single pr.
Package in the world decides to come.
Like three days after i film an unboxing.
Free pr video huh that's just my luck.
While i'm gluing this lost i do want to.
Talk about something that i addressed in.
The last video as well and that is the.
Illegal drugs that i received in my pure.
Package and i do want to give a major.
Major apology to a cloud9 syrup the.
Brand that did send me those products.
They are not illegal and they are not.
Drugs either and i felt so bad because.
Like after reading your guys's comments.
And doing some more research i was like.
So shocked and i felt so ignorant dumb.
So cbd and hemp oil are not illegal.
Contrary to what i thought in the video.
And they're also in marijuana like i did.
Think they're actually unlike the.
Medical side of marijuana the part of it.
That like actually helps you and doesn't.
Get you high.
Not gonna lie as soon as i recognize the.
Word hemp which i knew was in weed i was.
So turned off because you guys know that.
I'm very very anti drug and i am very.
Very ignorant to the topic it's.
Definitely not something that i've ever.
Wanted to learn about or wanted to.
Educate myself about just because i do.
Know that a lot of people in the social.
Media world and in the entertainment.
Industry do go into very very bad path.
A lot of like drugs and addiction and.
Stuff so that's just saying that i've.
Tried it very very hard to stay away.
From and i do pride myself in you can do.
Whatever you want but like i said i'm.
Very very ignorant to it so as soon as i.
Saw that i was like oh nope nope nope.
Nope not happening but after learning.
About it more i did realize that it was.
Part of the medical side and i saw so.
Many comments from you guys being like.
Oh my god this is so disrespectful like.
I used hemp oil and cbd every single.
Night because i have really bad anxiety.
And i was like oh my god.
Obviously mental health is so important.
That i would never want to purposely.
Degrade anxieties or mental health.
Issues at all and i really do sincerely.
Apologize if my comments in the last.
Video i offended you in any way shape or.
Form like i said i was ignorant to the.
Topic but now i've educated myself on it.
And it's so amazing that products like.
This do exist on the market to help.
People out with those type of issues.
Because i know they are very very.
Serious thing like i said that is very.
Very much not my world and instead of.
Educating myself i just made a very very.
Ignorant comment for a clickbait title.
Which was definitely wrong so i do.
Apologize and it is still not for me but.
If you guys want to check out their.
Products please do check them out they.
Are an awesome brand and the brand has.
Reached out to me cents and like gave me.
A ton of information so yes.
Sorry to cloud9 syrup and if you guys.
Want to check it out i will link this up.
Down below alright and they're both.
Creases all cut and ready to go and now.
It's time for what we've all been.
Waiting for the glow for my highlighter.
Today i'm using the brand new anasazi.
Liquid glow and i'm gonna be using the.
Shade perla today so in the last video i.
Swatch for you guys to shade peach phase.
Which if you actually look at the two.
Labels on the boxes the colors if it'll.
Focus look pretty relatively similar and.
I did use peach phase but apparently.
That is actually a darker shade than.
Perla which is why i was giving that.
Dark reflect which i was worried about.
So for today we're growing the shade.
Pearl and hopefully that'll be light.
Enough for my skin tone oh my god you're.
Kidding this is gonna be so good i can.
Already tell.
So you can definitely apply a lot of it.
In one area if you want to super.
Pigmented highlight and you also see.
That you can apply a little bit of it.
And really blend it out to get a more.
Subtle glow and it definitely like looks.
Beautiful either way guys sister.
Trevor's here comes my sister sister.
Ain't that mr. mister on the radio so.
You know you're gonna look good thanks.
Alright i'm also gonna got my anasazi at.
Number 8 14 brush and dab a little tiny.
Bit of this to highlight my nose oh my.
God.
Literary satellites from space are.
Crashing as we speak this note are you.
Kidding me this is so beautiful.
And i'm also gonna play a little bit.
This on my brow bone as always i've been.
Loving highlighting up here recently for.
That summer natural dewy glow and oh my.
God this highlighter is literally gg.
Gorged it is everything so the anasazi.
Liquid highlighters are definitely a win.
From me as you can see on my face right.
Now they look so beyond sunny i am so.
Shocked and these are definitely a new.
Step to my regular makeup routine so.
Hollywood can move over i mean this.
Sister would definitely still be here.
But this is definitely a new contender.
For sure and i definitely try these out.
In my everyday makeup routine as well.
But when i do like a more dewy no powder.
Looks i will definitely let you guys.
Know how it works on there - especially.
Unlike the body and the collarbones oh.
My god i'm just picturing how frickin.
Stunning that would look alright so now.
That this look is all complete the last.
Step is going to be the lips of course.
And for today i'm using the ofra liquid.
Lipstick in the shade so paulo this is.
Not a first impressions obviously i love.
Oprah and you guys know you can use.
Coach azar 30% off all oprah products.
They are so bomb i actually did not.
Receive any new lip products in any pr.
Packages recently so yeah and then of.
Course to finish off this look we're.
Going to use our urban decay all nighter.
Setting spray to lock our face in place.
