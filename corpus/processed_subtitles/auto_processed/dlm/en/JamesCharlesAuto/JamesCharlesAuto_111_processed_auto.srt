Much for all the love and support and.
Without further ado let's dive into.
Today is a brand new video.
So when i was talking about the pr box.
Is a few seconds ago you guys just heard.
Me say that it was a real james chance.
For people at now why would that matter.
You're wondering well because some very.
Shady people and companies out there.
Have decided that since the james.
Charles acts murphy palette and sisters.
Sold out worldwide and is by far the.
Most sought after makeup line on this.
Holiday season and ulta and morphic.
Can't keep it in stock that they would.
Try to keep it in stock and make their.
Own to try to cash in.
The sales absolutely not sense of how i.
First sold out a few weeks ago i've been.
Getting tweets and screenshots literally.
Every single day from you guys i've.
Either fake website saying they're.
Selling the palette and running ads all.
Over facebook on all of our social media.
Of people listing their palette on ebay.
For hundreds and hundreds of dollars.
Which is so ridiculous also people that.
Are literally emailing you sisters on.
Youtube comments saying that they have.
Amazon gift cards and different palettes.
For you guys to win it is so ridiculous.
Editors may be so incredibly furious.
That there are actually people out there.
That are trying to take advantage to you.
Guys please please please do not fall.
For anything the only places where you.
Guys can buy the palette or a more calm.
And ulta calm and i will always tell you.
Guys when there's a restock coming the.
More of you legal team and my legal team.
Have been working together very very.
Closely recently to make sure that this.
Is taken care of and they've been.
Sending a cease and desist after cease.
And desist of all these online listings.
Makes your production has stopped.
Immediately and all the listings are.
Taken down it is so disrespectful that.
These people want to stop my name and.
Face and hard work on a god knows.
Whatever product this is to try to sell.
It for a few extra dollars so for.
Today's video i thought if these guys.
Are trying to a sister scam you and get.
You to order their pallets that is.
Exactly what i would do now i've done a.
Video like this on my channel a few.
Years ago when i tested out fake makeup.
And to do this i had it over to santee.
Alley santee alley is a very famous and.
Iconic street located right here in.
Downtown los angeles who triggered where.
They basically sell everything you.
Possibly imagine well there be a trendy.
Off-white belt the newest lima time by a.
Pair of $10,000 ysl diamond heels by and.
By the way i think or whatever beauty.
Collaboration had just launched you.
Could definitely find it in the streets.
Of santee alley well at least something.
Close to it i had no idea that was gonna.
Actually exist yet because obviously.
Pellet just launched a few weeks ago so.
I had it over to santee alley to see if.
Anybody had a fake jacob charles x.
Murphy palette i tried my hardest to.
Film on the dl because they're very very.
Strict about their after searching every.
Street and talking to every single.
Makeup vendor in santee alley for over.
Two hours literally on my way out there.
Was.
Last and that i happened to mess and i.
Was losing it all but i wanted to at.
Least give it a shot so i said hello and.
He said hola and i said tiene la pelea.
De chambre james charles x murphy and he.
Said see you'll think of so low dose and.
I said cunto cuesta and he said fanta.
Tolerates that i said tommy lowe and.
Finally after a very very long day and.
Also an equally as long video intro we.
Are back home with this the james.
Charles acts morphe palette for today's.
Video we're going to be testing out and.
Comparing these babies right here the.
Real version and the fake person i.
Literally have not even opened this up.
Yet i wanted to save my first impression.
On camera but we're gonna be swatching.
Them looking at the colors of the.
Rotation and the shade names the actual.
Sizes of palette which already are.
Literally it not the same and i'm gonna.
Try to put them on my eyes as well.
Hopefully i don't get an eye infection.
Or get hurt we have no idea where these.
Palettes are being produced and their.
Venom soleil reports and stories of the.
Most repulsive ingredients going into.
Fake makeup such as literal rot feces in.
Your health news this afternoon makeup.
Buyers beware sometimes when you spot a.
Good deal on knockoff brands it really.
Is too good to be true the los angeles.
Police say they have confiscated.
Counterfeit makeup that tested positive.
For high levels of bacteria and also get.
This animal waste i am doing this at my.
Own risk so please do not try this at.
Home i wanted to do this video today to.
Show you guys the dangers of thick.
Makeup and also to address the scams so.
You guys can be smart and not make any.
Bad purchases but also to see if a.
Knockoff can compare to literally the.
Best makeup palette on the marketplace.
Right now so that further new i already.
Have my face on let's jump into the.
Video.
Music.
Alright guys let's just jump right into.
This i have been dying to open this up.
All wording blog and see what the heck.
Is inside oh my god so first of all the.
Packaging it clearly not the same of my.
Head is like 800 percent bigger on this.
And also this skin tone situation we.
Really don't love a sister's candle so.
I'm gonna need them to fix that.
Immediately it's a darker packaging and.
Also as well.
It's literally like an inch smaller and.
To me i have a feeling that we might.
Open this up and it'll be a 35 color.
Palette as opposed to a 39 color palette.
So i don't know what's gonna begin here.
Looking at the back of the boxes the.
Note and signatures are exactly the same.
Except there's a few typos in the fake.
Version for some reason the h and.
Charles is capital and morphe brushes is.
Spelled wrong let's look at the.
Ingredients on the back of my palette.
There's a huge detailed paragraph of all.
The different shades the different.
Formulas at the different ingredients in.
The pressed pigment or the regular.
Shadows on the back of this palette.
There are not but the shade names on.
This are safe word charm dominatrix.
Military fetish androgyny poison and.
Swallow now i don't know about you guys.
But those names definitely are not in.
The james charles ex murphy palette but.
I'll tell you what palette they are in.
The jeffree star cosmetics androgyny.
Palette i'm really not sure how people.
Still be headed to mix jeffrey and i on.
We look nothing alike and are both.
Incredibly hard-working and have our own.
Things going on but at this point i.
Think i need to open this up you guys.
I've been waiting for way too long and i.
Just need to see what's inside oh i.
Think it still looks like my palette.
Here's the real one here is the fake one.
I just need to open this up i don't know.
Why i'm so scared oh my god okay oh wow.
Well first all this plastic has.
Literally nothing on it so that's.
Looking at these two problems back to.
Each other a lot of these shapes are.
Completely wrong like literally if.
There's fabulous chains left and right.
Those colors that are wrong but from.
Afar definitely my palate unleash your.
Inner honest more like unleash my inner.
Lawsuit before i jump in and start.
Playing i think i want to do a few.
Swatches we have my ring light oh my and.
The other ring light okay gross we have.
You're kidding and you're kidding this.
Is little orange okay we have spooky and.
Spooky oh wow that's odd we have a.
Social blade and social blade literally.
Not even the same formula okay we have a.
Playground and playground you and last i.
Want to do escape this is a hard one and.
Escape oh god.
Look just looking at these two on the.
Finger you can already tell we have.
Escaped and escaped oh so sad okay i'm.
Gonna go ahead and take this off my arm.
And so far so good my skin is not.
Reacting in any sort of way thank god.
I'm gonna put on an eye primer so you.
Put these shadows to the true test all.
Right so i just went ahead at night zoom.
Do you guys add it to do these i look so.
You guys can really see it the full.
Details of what's going on i have no.
Idea what is about to happen on my.
Eyelids but hopefully nothing that bad i.
Do have a holiday parties to go to after.
Filming this video so i think i.
Definitely wanna do like a kind of red a.
Smoky cranberry moment on the eyes but i.
Was gonna go ahead and play and see what.
We can come up with i'm first.
Underground they're real you're kidding.
On em four five six and put this shade.
Right into the crease using a tapping.
Motions for maximum pigmentation and.
Then with a clean em four five six gonna.
Dip into the same shade on the other.
Side do the same exact thing pat this.
Right on.
Corner and top it into the crease wow.
Alright so i have no idea what's going.
On in this outer corner there are.
Certain areas where the shadow just is.
Not grabbing - and there's also this.
Really really strange like line right.
Here i'm gonna try to tap on some more.
Pigment see if that all fix it the.
Pigmentation is also just not really.
There i've had a layer that's up many.
Times it's not look good okay with an.
Emperor 33 brush i'm gonna dip into the.
Shader code james and i'm gonna place.
This right above thought you're kidding.
And you set to buff out the edge a.
Little bit to be honest with you i don't.
Think i've actually used these two.
Colors together yet but that's literally.
The perfect transition shade oh my gosh.
Grab me a cleanup 433 i'm gonna dip into.
The same shade in the knockoff palette.
And use this to blend out this other.
Edge oh my god i'm really having to.
Blend this so hard to even get the.
Shadows to show up what is this line.
Like dude okay maybe if i try to put.
Back the you're kidding overtop at.
Alltech so just gonna pop this in there.
Okay that definitely fixed it a little.
Bit i definitely want to deep it up this.
Crease so i'm gonna grab an avid four.
Five six and dip into a boutique the.
Dark matte cranberry red and layered.
This over top and put it in the outer.
Area all this color is so pretty.
And then blending it out with that same.
Brush that we had at you're kidding on.
So on this side i'm gonna go another m.
Four or five six and dip into the same.
Shade in this side boutique but before i.
Even put this on this is my boutique and.
This is this boutique so i am gonna have.
Two different eye looks it's very clear.
We're playing a little bit of a game of.
One of these things is not like the.
Other doing the same thing packing the.
Shade right into the crease just even.
Doing anything hello whatever i'm four.
Three three back into the fake you're.
Kidding i'm gonna see if that blends.
Anything out a little bit there's two.
Different looks here i really know what.
To do i can't go to a party looking like.
This are you literally kidding me the.
Pigmentation isn't bad and the fake.
Palate but it's just not the same colors.
I think is like the real issue here this.
Is clearly a lot more dark and smoky and.
Cranberry whereas we just layer it on.
Three colors and it all looks like the.
Same exact shade of bright orange.
Next under grabbin em 506 and dip into.
The shade and benny and maya palette.
Which is kind of like the dark.
Eggplant e color and pop this right in.
This outer v and really darken this up.
Literally love the shade gonna bring the.
X that's right into the crease as well.
Oh yes that it's so pretty oh well oh my.
God another ny bow sex is dipping into.
The shade benny i can already tell that.
This one is not nearly as dog here's my.
Opinion here is the fake one basing this.
Right in this outer v once again topping.
The shade on there that's ad oh my gosh.
Okay let's add on a lot more what's so.
Weird is that the shadow is actually.
Going on and blending nicely and some.
Spots but it's clinging and won't blend.
It all in.
Others like i've never seen this happen.
Before what's going on shadow will not.
Stick right there at all my neck step is.
Gonna be to cut the crease so we're.
Gonna do that i'm gonna cut the crease.
Using a tab 2 to 4 brush and a little.
Bit of concealer alright so now that the.
Creases are all caught i want to go in.
And i want to layer on some metallic.
Shades on there for a nice pop of.
Festive color i'm gonna have it one two.
Four brush and dip it to the shade.
Shucks which is the cranberry metallic.
Red and i'm gonna pack this shade right.
On the middle of the lid oh my god i'm.
So pretty i don't know why i actually.
Haven't done a like cranberry red eye.
Look yet with the palette i literally.
Have just not had time but this looks so.
Gorgeous gonna use it and blend it into.
The dark cranberry shade over here as.
Well for a smooth transition clean brush.
Up in a grab chuck once again from the.
Fake palette i don't gonna place this in.
The same exact spot on the fake side wow.
That's underwhelming okay then i really.
Take my brush into here talking this.
Right onto the lid.
Okay i'm gonna use this to blend out.
That outer edge as well and then finally.
Just to brighten everything up a little.
Bit in the inner corner i'm gonna grab.
Another m at 12 for this one is clean.
And dip it to a mix of the shades.
Literally and also a little bit of a.
Sister gonna talk that little concoction.
Right in the inner corner and blending.
It into shucks oh that is so pretty oh.
My gosh so for the other eye at once.
Again doc i mean that 1 to 4 brush i'm.
Gonna do litter.
Sister what got you here literally is a.
Matte shade in this palette so not.
Really sure how this is gonna work out.
Well you know we're gonna do it okay.
Since i do a party to go to after this.
And i don't want to look disgusting i'm.
Just gonna grab a sister because at.
Least it's a metallic shade and i'm.
Gonna pop that in here here's what we.
Have for the real palette is so far.
Really beautiful and here's what we have.
For the think palette is so far not.
Horrible but definitely not comparable.
In any way shape or form to the original.
Start over the lower lash line just.
Grabbing you're kidding on an am a four.
Five six brush and tucking this right.
Under here and blending it into the.
Outer edge same thing on the other side.
Please one oh my god back to the other.
Eye dropping a little bit of boutique on.
A tiny pencil brush and using this to.
Deepen up the lash line packing the.
Shade right on there.
And same thing on the other eye once.
Again where is this color like it blends.
On to nothing.
So that's the eye look all complete i.
Guess i'm gonna add mascara and lashes.
Off-camera in just a second but i want.
To go ahead and finish out the face.
Using a few other shades from the.
Palette like i normally do before i give.
My final thoughts although you guys can.
Probably already guess what they are.
Like always gonna give my face a light.
Spritz of the more v prep and set.
Settings right to prep for highlighter.
Again we're gonna add a 501 brush and.
Dipping into a face in my palette a.
Little bit above the brow bone as always.
Gonna tuck a little bit of that right.
Below the brow as well clean em 501 and.
Dipping into the shade and face i'm.
Already a little bit scared because the.
Shame is a lot darker than the one in my.
Palette but let see how this works.
No no absol giving not only isn't nearly.
As close as blinding to the other side.
But it's also way too dark just like i.
Thought as you can see when i look.
Forward you can literally see dark.
Orange right there where as on the side.
Nothingjust kintama bam at last so.
Finally not least you guys know my.
All-time favorite trick with the palette.
Robbing a blush brush this is the e4 and.
To begin to the shade and literally the.
Metallic bright pink that we have right.
On that lid and using this to mix.
Together the.
I am loved stones for a beautiful pop of.
Pink so pretty and then finally another.
84 brush and to begin to you literally.
Must be laughing oh my little i don't.
Even want to do this so now you want to.
Be pigmented no no absolutely not.
Of all the times this palette had an.
Opportunity to be pigmented it chooses.
Right now look are you literally kidding.
All right sisters i'm gonna go pop on.
Some lashes and the lip to finish off.
This look and i'll be right back alright.
You guys i just popped on some lashes.
These are the lily lashes in the style.
So extra miami has talked a little bit.
Of glitter liner in the crease just to.
Distract from the bad shopping going on.
On this side and also pops out and kylie.
Liquid lipstick in the shade or not pout.
To finish up this cranberry smoky clam.
All right you guys and i think this is.
The final oh the think now nobody has.
The same message on ever and in white.
The real car literally does not even.
Have that i am just realizing this right.
Now as i was saying i think that is this.
Real person.
Fake makeup challenge all complete using.
My pallets look at the two different.
Sides of my face there is definitely a.
Major difference in how the look turned.
Out i said in the beginning of the video.
That i really wanted to eat deep.
Cranberry smoky glam but perfect for a.
Holiday party and i was definitely able.
To achieve that the less that my face.
Using the real palette you're kidding.
Coach apes and boutique blended so.
Beautifully in the crease and shook.
Literally and sister with a pop of.
Glitter liner overtop blended so.
Beautifully on the lid for a really.
Amazing transition now on the other side.
Of my face i will say that the shadows.
Were horrible they definitely had a some.
Sort of pigmentation to them but as you.
Can tell i definitely did not get a.
Cranberry smokey eye and this is way.
More orange tone and the deep shades.
Just really did not get as deep as i.
Wanted them to be and they were.
Extremely hard to blend there is still a.
Major patchy area in this outside edge.
And whenever i tried up on a metallic.
Sheen over in this outer corner the.
Shadow literally disappeared regard to.
The actual swatches that you guys saw it.
Live in the beginning and these colors.
Definitely do swatch but nowhere near as.
Beautifully as the colors and the.
Original pilot do so many of these are.
Just super super talking at how.
Like no pigmentation to him it's.
Honestly just like mmm can't relate i.
Mean i feel like at this point the.
Winner of this competition goes without.
Saying it's pretty obvious i may have a.
Little bit of a personal bias here but i.
Am definitely going to declare my.
Original palette the victor santee alley.
Sweetie i am so so so sorry but it just.
Does not compare in any way shape or.
Form and normally i would say it's the.
Thought that counts but myself and the.
Morphe team put in over a year of work.
Time love and thought into this palette.
And the thought is counting in sales.
Like i said in the beginning of this.
Video you guys i am so incredibly.
Grateful for all your love and support.
With the launch of my palette i cannot.
Believe that it is sold out time and.
Time and time again i promise you though.
It is a permanent item and it will keep.
Coming back if you guys have not yet.
Been able to get your hands on it please.
Be patient and i beg of you please.
Please please please do not fall for any.
Of these scams or fake listings about.
The palette although it may look very.
Very similar.
You were just not getting the same color.
Payoff and pigmentation the blend.
Ability and god knows what ingredients.
Went into these like i said there have.
Been so many horrible articles and.
Findings of the most disgusting things.
In these doctory so it is so horrible.
That people are taking advantage of you.
Guys i do not want your sisters.
Hard-earned money going to god knows.

Even more importantly i really really do.
Not want you guys to get hurt please.
