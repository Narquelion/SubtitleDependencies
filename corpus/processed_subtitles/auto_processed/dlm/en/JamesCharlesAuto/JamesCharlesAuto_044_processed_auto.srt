Hi sisters jean-charles here and welcome.
Back to my youtube channel today i'm.
Joined with a super super special gust.
Miss love so for today's video.
Lauralee just did a my makeup over on.
Her channel and i'm gonna now do her.
Makeup that's a beauty guru as we always.
Get to be in our own faces every single.
Day videos all the time for different.
Events but it's really really rare that.
We actually get to get our face beat.
Other people let alone other beauty.
Gurus exactly yeah intimidating a way.
More intimidating because i don't know i.
Think they'll like you do the full beat.
Glam like you know the full we clams.
Yeah oh my gosh okay.
Oh wow i do too we did however at the.
End of the look give a brutal on it yeah.
Beat down out the last words out things.
That james wasn't obsessed with but.
You'll have to wait i have to check out.
Yeah so she's gonna do the same thing we.
Should go tell me.
Well the tears if she hates it actually.
Loves it how she feels so without.
Further ado i'm gonna be auras face now.
Make sure you stay tuned at the end of.
The video for her brutal breakdown of.
The makeup and then i also check out our.
Video on laura's tail or she beats my.
Face in this beautiful glam without.
Further ado let's get started.
Music.
So those are my preparing laura's face.
Using the benefit porefessional primer.
You guys know that i love this primer.
And also it is one of florence favorites.
Too so we're using the hourglass.
Foundation stick in the shade beige face.
That she already knew she do you prefer.
Liquid foundations or stick funders.
Usually um this is i'm a go to but.
Lately i've been using the alarmist.
Mercier a flawless fusion for a liquid.
Or i love like the milani.
The joke comes we weren't perfect yes.
Honey i don't try that one it's so good.
Really yeah it feels like a high-end.
Foundation so i call it concealer.
Say it concealer concealer yeah people.
Say is they wrong i don't hear it come.
See what her concealer yeah i don't.
Think you're saying it wrong i don't.
Think they're wrong either i think what.
Does anyone either love our voices or.
Hate our voices.
Yeah there's no in-between oh we have in.
Common i hope you do we have.
Boys thing oh people hate my voice oh my.
God that makes me love you so much more.
People say that i sound like i have.
Something stuck in my throat when i'm.
Talking people say i sound like i'm.
Constantly sick which is i mean i guess.
Kind of true but minor minor truth to.
People sound like it sounds like i'm.
Whining or that like i have like an old.
Lady's voice it's like a lot of people.
Hate my voice because i talk too fast.
Which we use a lot of people comment.
Saying that i give them anxiety because.
I talk so fast which is really scary.
Because i really do try to not but i.
Can't help that so if you're one of.
Those people i apologize there's.
Actually a little speed button where if.
You click the gear on your video you can.
Change the speed to 75 per size it was.
200 and then i'll be a lot more slowed.
Down so if you were someone who wants to.
Hear me talk a little bit slower or.
Anybody for that matter chocolate mousse.
A little or faster that's a really good.
Hack for you guys okay i'm gonna contro.
Laura's face using my benefit hoola.
Bronzer before favourites anything i'm.
Worth ii am five seventy brush do you.
Feel like have a small head you do have.
A small can you see it now you do it's.
Like super small i tell people so once.
The bronze is all on one check that i.
Absolutely love doing when it comes to a.
Contract and bronzing is taking a like.
Smaller fluffy brush like this one but i.
Let's go into the more cool toned.
Bronzer so this one is the marc jacobs.
Bronzer and tantastic which is definite.
Little bit more cool tone then benefit.
Hoola and i so grabbed this on a more of.
Tapered brush and just go in it right on.
That contour line it to get a more like.
Defined contour right in the hollow of.
The cheek bone i've never done this.
Before this is like one my favorite.
Tricks that i just started doing i feel.
Like it just adds a lot more dimension.
And really like gives you the snatched.
I think everything how about someone.
Does my makeup or i watch someone do.
Makeup or like i just went to make it by.
Mario's seminar hmm i think i learned a.
Lot of things that like everything you.
Just never stop learning yeah i feel.
Like i pick up different tricks from.
Each artists everybody does the make it.
Different always cool to see how other.
People do their makeup cuz you guys be.
Inspired and pick up different.
Techniques and learn to the things i.
Think it better and better and better.
I'm next to god by jd weighty 180 brush.
This is my all-time favorite nose.
Contouring brush from a lot see beauty.
On the benefit hoola bronzer and also.
Dipping a tiny bit into the marc jacobs.
Fantastic and we're gonna check out.
Laura's nose i love when i go out we can.
See a snatch news so i'm like oh yeah.
Yeah oh so she's doing natch that nose.
Then this one i have a powder puff and.
Uses to bake the sides of sister laura's.
Nose.
What do you feel like you'd be doing if.
You weren't on social media you didn't.
Take the social media path i'd only have.
No idea and i think about that honestly.
Like you would be in college somewhere i.
Think i would too which scares me.
Because i think college definitely was.
Not for me and i think i don't think.
College is for everybody i think.
Education is really important but i.
Don't think the college particularly for.
Everybody i think i would be really.
Struggling to figure out what i wanted.
To do with my life it's like that's a.
Lot of people and hear me out when i how.
I how much i agree with you on that.
Because i almost didn't graduate high.
School but because society said you know.
You gotta go to polish to make money or.
Be smarter to do anything gray so i was.
Able to get into a college and it took.
Me three years into college and i had.
Filled out i was 24 years old i had felt.
Out and i was left with a ass load of.
Debt for forcing something that society.
Put on me make me feel like i was smart.
So as a medical assistant at the time as.
Well working at dermatologists which i.
Made decent money i just really didn't.
Like the job so i got pushed into.
Youtube and i felt so madly in love with.
It and then me and youtube kind of grew.
Together and i created this amazing.
Career and it's all because i fell out.
Of college you know yeah i don't think.
It's everybody i think that everybody.
Has a different path and education.
Definitely is not part of everybody i.
Don't know where i would be if it wasn't.
For you too you know i started this.
Channel just simply as a makeup lover.
And all of a sudden supposed to be a.
Professional businesswoman and you know.
The role model for millions people and a.
Professional makeup artists and do.
Everything perfect and and it's just.
Like so much pressure gets thrown on you.
You know you're and then you start.
You're like whoa this is a lot yeah so.
While laura's baking in the oven at 350.
Degrees i'm gonna get my benefit precise.
Here brought pencil in the shade at.
Number four i'm gonna slay her brows and.
That's right i'm never gonna make.
Laura's brows go more out then down.
Towards the tail we were just talking.
About this how i've really been doing my.
Brows more out then down because i feel.
Like it gives a lot more eyelid space.
And i'm literally the mom off mean girls.
I'm like what school what's the four one.
One.
Mmm and she told me that this year all.
Her friends are assessed with this guy.
Named james charles and i'm serious i.
Know i was like interesting i was like.
James ii she was like yeah oh no way you.

Gonna grab some more shaped haven i want.
To use that to prime laura's island.
Dance i'm just gonna use a y 16 brush to.
Blend out that concealer and make sure.
The eyes are all primed and set in place.
And ready for the shadow all right so.
Now that the brows are both slated in.
Place we're gonna start with the eye.
Shadow and we're first gonna be laura.

Violent people were so mad tonight oh my.
God he's eating her ass no girl it's a.
Good about it so her personal stories in.
Miami 519 brush i'm gonna dip into a.
Bomb diggity and start putting this into.
Laura's crease as a transition shade.
This is honestly like all my favourite.
Transition shades of all time.
Thank you i love it too it's just such a.
Good like mustard a yellowy browns are.
My favorite i'm currently using the.
Shade of craig crayon an m 210 brush and.
I'm using this to pull out that outer.
Corner shadow and then also define a.
Decrease a little bit more another grab.
The jacqueline hip hop from a morphe one.
Of both of our all-time clearly clearly.
She's all dirty.
She's been used and loved unless we have.
Another m to ten brushes just a clean.
One and dip into this red tone and brown.
Shade down here then definitely tap off.
The fallout as well it's gonna pop this.
Right in laura's over v for some.
Definition i'm not making sure that when.
I take these shadows i'm pulling them.
Out and winging them as well that's like.
One of my all-time three things to do.
With my makeup you guys know that i love.
A go-to pulled out shadow moment it's.
Like my favorite thing in the world and.
I definitely widened my face when i were.
Literally just talking about earlier how.
She like wishes she could do that and i.
Was like.
You can you can do it i'm just gonna do.
It i'm gonna grab fluorescein a.
Scatterbrain only em or two one brush.
And i'm going to spread it a little bit.
Using some fix+ that's what folks plus.
All my shimmers no matter what shimmer.
It is yeah i can't oh my god i literally.
Hate when people are using a palette and.
They're like well dry you have to use.
Sex awesome dah.
Yeah i mean i don't want to i do not and.
Even if it performs like a gym dry i'm.
Still fixing it sam it helps with.
Fallout 2 like it helps snatch it all.
Together and if you don't like when a.
Purchase fix+.
Even a little bit of water spray bottle.
It don't ya it doesn't have to be fixed.
Less once i have that legit oh i'm gonna.
Go anyway r39 brush and dip into the.
Shade of cray cray and just use this to.
Blend over the edge of that glitter.
Pigment and then also the darker shades.
In the outer corner make sure that that.
Is a smooth even transition for the half.
Cut crease so if you only got to use one.
Makeup product for the rest of your life.
No i'll give you three three products so.
Generous yes and i'm trying to be.
Generous here three products desert.
Island you know yeah that too mm-hmm.
What's it gonna be i feel like a.
Concealer pam a brow pencil and a.
Highlighter love it what would you do i.
Would do i would do a concealer because.
I'll put a concealer on with no other.
Makeup so if you like like what could be.
Worn alone you know concealer mascara.
And probably huggin blotting powder no.
Why.
Yeah for the lower lash line in the.
Jacqueline palette i'm going to cry.
The sigma eat 20 bucks which is a flat.
Shader brush and i'm gonna grab the.
Bright ass teal shade oh we get some.
Color pop is on a lois lower lash line.
I'm excited about this so good are you.
Kidding.
Oh come on fire i'm gonna have an amat.
To ten brush and dip it to a little bit.
Of bomb diggity which is that amazing.
Transition shade and just buff out the.
Bottom line about to make sure the blue.
Isn't too like harsh then i'm gonna dip.
Back into that blue and then i'm gonna.
Just add a lot of fix+ to really get a.
Pigmented huh well she does a good tunt.
Pop have a weak one but i do it.
Literally all the time still it's a.
Popper tones baby she's a weak one.
The actual better go the darker blue.
Shade and the purple shade from the.
Chocolate palette once again it got me a.
Little bit of fix+ and i'm gonna put.
That in the outer corner mixing it.
Together the bright blue and then also.
Kind of mending it into those darker.
Purple red shades that are on the upper.
Lash line to kind of connect those.
Together and then one more time of.
Grabbing my 210 rush i'm just gonna dip.
Into a warm tone orange shade and just.
Blend out the bottom at one last time or.
What is your favorite makeup look that.
You've ever done on yourself i think i.
Recently did one with maya i shoulda.
Palette because as you know like i have.
Been doing tutorials as much um i've.
Been reviewing new makeup that's been.
Launching but one of my favorites for.
Sure is look i actually do have a.
Palette and i actually spent a long long.
Time doing it i did like a mac cut.
Crease but like shimmer in the middle of.
The cut crease it was really intricate.
What about you um i know you got some.
Looks i have sort of definitely some.
Good luck yes i think that my favorite.
Whatever was probably my eclipse look.
From oh yeah like the food mm-hmm i just.
Added the came in i have my liquid liner.
And didn't really use that as a liner i.
Just kind of more fill to end and then.
Use it to define that crease it was good.
Girl that's you watching sometimes you.
Just get blessed i should be watching a.
Movie cuz i'm gonna have lara lally.
Apply her own at mascara that's just our.
Rules and.
Jules in the artistry if you're working.

Grabbing the lily lashes my emily's.
These are my all-time favorite lashes oh.
My god so lourdes is introduced me to.
This new lash glue from the loire called.
The lash adhesive and it's the best ever.
And i'm so hated to not try this for.
Myself.
Good it dries out so quickly and like.
Sticks which never happens because you.
Guys know every time i put on an eyelash.
I was sitting there fumbling with the.
Freaking inner corner for like 20 that's.
Everybody there she is.
Yep that's good ever been out and about.
And then your inner corner just pops up.
Yeah oh yeah that's why i carry law.
School at all times i mean that me -.

Stuff if i'm wearing makeup i always.
Have oslo and a pair of tweezers and a.
Beautyblender and blotting powder and.

I'm also there go a little bit of.
Scatterbrain on that same brush and i'm.
Going to use that to kind of like really.
Lightly blend together the bronzer and.
The highlighter i like doing this a lot.
Actually using like a more metallic.
Shade rather than highlighter to blend.
Together just for like a more subtle.
Glow also using this shade to highlight.
Laura's do we do hello your forehead.
