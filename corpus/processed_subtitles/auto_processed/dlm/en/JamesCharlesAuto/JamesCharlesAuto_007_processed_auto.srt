Oh stewart this beauty industry is.
Ruthless have you ever had anything.
Stolen from you i've actually had my.
Wallet so in three different time oh how.
Did you manage to let that happen i'm.
Not exactly the most organized person.

Point about you what would you say is.
I'm always brutally honest love ah.
Interesting what is your sign.
I'm a loud and proud gemini yeah um well.
How do you deal with the online gem and.
I hate do you feel personally attacked.
Ever online regardless so i don't really.
Care about that type of stuff all right.
Well what is your least favorite social.
Media platform probably twitter and what.
About your most favorite probably.
Instagram is where i got my start and.
It's where my biggest fall i guess how.
Long ago did you get your start on.
Instagram oh my gosh that's like nothing.
How long have you been wearing makeup.
For then also just over two years oh my.
Gosh i need to learn from you because.
I'm still learning and it has been well.
Over two years but it's awesome that you.
Blew up quickly what is your biggest.
Achievement this year i just had two.
Million subscribers on my youtube.
Channel and what do you call your.
Subscribers my sister how cute but why.
Is that well i think the word fan is.
Ugliest word in the world and i consider.
Them like my family well having a lot of.
People following you online is amazing.
But does it ever become overwhelming let.
Us all know oh not gonna lie honestly.
Yeah it really does having two million.
People watching your every move.

Very very blessed to have the.
Opportunity of being a role model for a.
Ton of people so i love to be able to.
Learning.
And hopefully provide them with good wow.
So what's your favorite part of having a.
Platform um sorry people i feel like my.
Favorite part is getting messages from a.
Little boy something inside of them.
That's amazing but do you ever think.
There will ever be a day where it's.
Equally as common for every single.
Gender to wear makeup hmm that's a lot.
Honestly i do think so but i think it's.
Definitely going to take a while.
Unfortunately we do still live in a.
Society with very very having.
Stereotypes but because of beauty.
Bloggers like myself and more and more.
Brands working towards gender equality.
I do think they'll be a day in the.
Future where everybody gets rockin.
Beautiful glam amazing way to lead a.
Path by the way your lashes look.
Incredible thank you okay look amazing i.
See you have heaps and heaps of makeup.
How much do you think it is all worth if.
