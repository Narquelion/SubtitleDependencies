Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel.
Cutting straight to the point i'm going.
To a very very fun event tonight and i.
Have a lot that i want to talk to you.
Guys about i feel like we haven't sat.
Down and really done the chit chat.
Already to me for a very very long time.
I mean my clothing line lunch and i am.
So excited to see all of you guys.
Rocking all the sisters hoodies and then.
My music came out lastly can my acapella.
Group you guys were so excited about it.
And i am so excited about it and there.
Are so many more fun covers coming soon.
I also took a little bit of a break and.
Had a little bit of a breakdown on.
Twitter a few weeks ago as well which i.
Definitely want to talk about so yeah.
One little thing i forgot to mention.
Before this chitchat with me get started.
This video is sponsored by covergirl so.
Thank you so much to them don't forget.
To watch until the very end to see me.
Try out their brand-new i'm melting pout.
Lipsticks and yeah without further ado.
Grab your popcorn geiger pinkett eve.
Jenkins because this is going to be a.
Long one and let's get glam so i'm.
Obviously starting off with my base.
Already done i went ahead and did my.
Foundation at concealer of brows and.
Contour and powdered everything.
Off-camera same exact routine that i use.
Every single time so let's just go in.
With the eyes for today's eye shadow.
Look we're gonna be using two very very.
Unique palettes that i never use on my.
Channel being the morphe 35o and the.
Morphe 35o palette i want to create like.
A sunset i look so i'm gonna start off.
By guarding my m4 for one brush and dip.
Into this late transition.
Omg shade right here and put it in the.
Crease while i'm doing my eyes i do.
Definitely wanna talk about the negative.
With you guys before we get into the fun.
And positive things for the remainder.
And majority of this video but i do just.
Want to address this and that is kind of.
Why i took a little bit of a break from.
Youtube and social media for a few days.
And also why i've been a little bit down.
In the dumps when it comes to like.
Twitter and filming lately i feel like a.
Lot of social media influencers just.
Live their lives and our lives look so.
Crazy and fun to you guys on the outside.
But on the inside there's a lot of stuff.
That goes on behind the scenes and a lot.
Of emotions behind it and i feel like a.
Lot of people don't like to talk about.
That and i definitely happen to talk.
About that a lot i'm next intagram im.
433 and dip into this warm tone orange.
Shade away over here i would definitely.
Talk to you guys about how i was feeling.
And sometimes being a social media.
Influence or having an online.
Personality is really really hard.
And i'm not talking about on a physical.
Level because let's be real we literally.
Sit in front of a camera and make.
Freakin makeup tutorials in our.
Underwear for a living so i definitely.
Am not talking about on a physical level.
But on an emotional level is where this.
Job can be sometimes really really.
Really stressful and super overwhelming.
Up next we have another clean m for.
Three three and dip into the mac blush.
In the shade sketch simply because i.
Don't have a good maroon eyeshadow that.
I really like i know when it comes to a.
Lot of social media influencers.
Including myself a lot of us like to.
Pretend that hate comments don't get to.
Us i mean you always see us doing like.
Reading hate home videos or posting hate.
Tweets on twitter just to give like a.
Good laugh for you guys but honestly at.
The end of the day i don't care what.
Anybody says one thousands and thousands.
And thousands i hate comments are coming.
In eventually they're gonna start to get.
To you and is sometimes really really.
Hard to focus on the positive when there.
Is so much negativity on the internet.
Let's be real i've definitely made a lot.
Of mistakes in the past that i am not.
Proud of but i've apologized and own up.
To every single one of them which i.
Think is really really vital in order to.
Grow and become a better person but.
Let's also be real and saying that i.
Definitely am an easy target for the.
Internet to pick on in laughi at the end.
Of the day a lot of people said that.
Hate comments don't get to them.
Including myself i really try hard and.
Not let hate give to me i'm just to.
Focus on the positivity because there is.
So much positivity with you guys but.
When you do start to receive thousands.
And thousands of hate comments on like a.
Video or a tweet that you pose it really.
Can put a lot of pressure on you and.
Make you start to question your morals.
And why are doing what you do and for me.
If that happens relatively often have.
You been following me on snap or twitter.
For a while you would know that there.
Was a time about two weeks ago where i.
Had a little bit of a breakdown on.
Snapchat video i was filming and i did.
Actually end up taking a break from.
Social media completely for a few days.
Because everything just got really.
Really overwhelming and i want you guys.
To know that it's okay i'm nice tender.
Grab that same m for three three and dip.
Into at these two purple shades right.
Here and use that to deepen up the.
Crease when i talk about this openly.
With you guys i don't want you to think.
I'm complaining or ungrateful in any way.
Shape or form because but isn't the case.
At all in fact what i tweeted that i.
Needed a few days to take a mental break.
I got so many amazing messages from all.
Of you guys that completely understood.
Where i was coming from which meant the.
Entire world to me i also got a lot of.
Tweets and messages saying oh my god.
You're 18 years old living in the middle.
Of la like i said i am so thankful to be.
Living a very very kind life thanks to.
You guys but at the end of the day there.
Is no amount of money that can buy.
Happiness.
Trust me on this one and unfortunately.
With this job often comes a lot of.
Pressure like i said and a lot of.
Responsibility and a lot of negativity.
As well so sometimes that happiness can.
Be really really hard to find no matter.
How much money is in your bank account.
No matter how many cool opportunities.
You're having it no matter what car you.
Drive where you're living.
Happiness comes from within and.
Sometimes no matter who you are what.
You're doing what your job is you need.
To take a mental break because mental.
Health is so so so so so important and.
Definitely needs to come before any type.
Of post on social media i don't want to.
Sound like i'm complaining or ungrateful.
In any way shape or form there are so.
Many more important and awful things.
Going on in the world right now that.
Make my issues literally non-existent.
But i do just want to have an open.
Conversation with you guys about this.
Because i know it's something that not a.
Lot of influencers address but i.
Definitely do and i know a lot of you.
Guys do look up to me as well not only.
For makeup but also for life advice.
Which means literally the entire world.
To me and i do try best to be a good.
Role model obviously of course we're.
Gonna fail sometimes but if you were.
Like me a few weeks ago and you do get.
In a rut or you're not feeling creative.
Or inspired take a few days off do it.
Every night or do to get your heart back.
In the game mental health is so.
Important so sometimes taking a break is.
Totally okay and i definitely wanted to.
Share that message with you guys i know.
It's well a lot of people were wondering.
Whether or not i was gonna quit youtube.
And obviously hello i am here i don't.
Plan on leaving anytime soon i have a.
Lot of really really good content coming.
Out and a lot of products that i'm.
Working on that i am literally so.
Excited for you guys to see but like i.
Said definitely needed a few days off.
But sister is back and ready to go so.
Now that we have up all the negative out.
Of the way thank god we can focus on the.
Positive but before we get into that i'm.
Gonna grab some more shave tape in the.
Shade lights and and just put a little.
Bit on the back of my hand and grabbing.
My way to go morphe and a four-to-one.
Brush i'm gonna cut the crease and then.
Quickly keeping my head tilted back so.
It doesn't crease i'm gonna grab my m 4.
To 5 brush and dip into my kodi ariston.
Powder and then set that concealer in.
Place and then without saying m 45 brush.
I'm just gonna dip into this light bone.
Color shade up in here and just set that.
In place for once i'm actually gonna.
Keep this eye look fully matte aside.
From the bravo and haley of course but i.
Really it's been a long time since i've.
Done a matte crease i usually end up.
Doing some type of a.
Shimmer on the lid but i'm kind of.
Getting tired of that right now so why.
Don't do a little bit of a matte sunset.
Look okay so onto a more positive note.
While i clean up this crease please but.
So many fun things have been happening.
Lately and i'm so excited that you guys.
Are finally getting to see them if you.
Saw last week my clothing line sister's.
Apparel finally dropped and you guys.
Went crazy i think we literally sold.
Almost 2,000 hoodies in under 24 hours.
Which is literally so insane i cannot.
Wait for you guys to all get your.
Sister's hoodies so you can take me your.
Little pictures and your flashback.
Mary's oh my god i just cannot wait i've.
Been working on such as apparel for.
Literally so long and i'm just so.
Excited that you guys are equally as.
Excited as i am and i also have a lot of.
Fun designs planned for the future as.
Well and a lot of things that are being.
Manufactured that are a lot more.
Complicated than just hoodies and hats.
So definitely keep your eyes peeled.
Because i bake big plans for sister's.
Apparel also if you guys saw my acapella.
Group flashback released our first ever.
Cover this past friday on my youtube.
Channel and i cannot even thank you guys.
Enough for the positive response we got.
So many of you guys absolutely love the.
Song and we were so so so nervous but.
Also excited to put it out music.
Obviously is a huge huge aspect of our.
Life that you guys really do not get to.
See much up until recently on my youtube.
Channel but i'm very very excited that i.
Get to share that with you guys now and.
We have so many exciting covers coming.
Soon on pascha that you guys are going.
To love this is just very very exciting.
For me because i've been singing with my.
Best friend anthony who's actually in.
The crew many of you guys know him since.
Literally we were in third grade and.
We've been trying to put together an.
Acapella group for literally like almost.
10 years now so we are so excited that.
We finally have a really good at group.
Of solid super super talented kids that.
All share the same love for music so.
Definitely keep your eyes peeled for.
Future flash projects because it is.
Definitely a group you were going to.
Want to watch trust me on that one i.
Think this look definitely needs a.
Little bit of a wing so i'm gonna grab.
My kat von d tattoo liner in the shade.
Trooper and just sketch out a sharp eye.
Swing ready to cut somebody that is.
Definitely a large in the charged wing.
But honestly i am kind of living for it.
I'm gonna grab my e43 brush from morphe.
And then a little bit more shape tape.
And just clean up the shadow below the.
Way.
I'm next area by nyx wonder pencil in.
The shade of light and just put that in.
My waterline same exact thing with the.
Upper that i'm gonna first off with my.
M4 for one and a bright orange shade and.
Disc all really really lightly.
Underneath the eye to create a.
Transition shade i'm also not breaking.
The shade fully to the inner corner.
Either because i do like to when i do.
These paper i looks cut out that inner.
Corner so it makes my eyes look a little.
Bit bigger and wider i'll show you guys.
In a second i'm next i'm gonna have an m.
At 213 and dip into that dark purple.
Shade from the 35b and connect the.
Winged liner and use this to hug the.
Lash line when i have this rush my hand.
With the purple when i get to the inner.
Corner i'm going to really really.
Lightly pull that forward as opposed to.
Following my natural eye shape and going.
Up i'm just creating kind of a second.
Little crease up in here and then i'm.
Gonna clean that up with concealer in.
This area this is very similar to drag.
Makeup which just makes my eyes look a.
Little bit bigger then once again we're.
Gonna grab miami 151 and dip into the.
Mac blush and the shade is sketch to.
Blend together that orange and purple.
Alright so that is when i all completed.
That was simply a very very lengthy.
Process and turned out a lot more.
Intense and i was planning on a but i.
Really really like this look so far so.
I'm gonna go into the other one off.
Camera quickly and i'll be right back to.
Finish off the rest of the eyes and the.
Rest of the face alright so that is the.
Other eye all complete this is.
Definitely a lot more intense of a look.
Than i was originally expecting or going.
For but i'm honestly it kind of loving.
For it or kind of loving for it oh my.
God.
Four lashes today i'm gonna go to the.
Lily lash in the style alena these.
Lashes are so so so beautiful they're.
Like very very good because they're big.
On the outside but tiny on the inside.
I definitely like these a lot what i'm.
Doing this i make sure to get super.
Close up to the root of the lash right.
Up in that upper waterline just because.
I don't ever do it black in the upper.
Waterline anymore because it always.
Makes me super uncomfortable where.
Throughout the day i always find myself.
Picking at my lashes at my waterline.
Because it always ends up transferring.
And it just makes my eyes feel really.
Really bad so i stopped doing that and.
It's made my life i don't see a million.
Times easier but now that i do mascara i.
Have to really make sure it's black up.
In that region so it doesn't look really.
Really dumb when i'm looking forward.
Like this sensor is a sunset look i.
Definitely wanna have a very golden.
Sunkissed highlight going on so of.
Course i'm gonna grab my anasazi upsell.
Hollywood illuminator and mix it with my.
Mary-lou manizer from the balm and i.
Also.
Gonna include a little bit of this ink.
Lot pigment in the shade 7 of course got.
A highlight above the brow bone as well.
This is what my all-time favorite makeup.
Tricks and they get a lot of questions.
About this too and why i do this and it.
Is because when you take photos from.
Either the side it gives you that nice.
Like glow like right there but also i.
Personally like it because when i take.
Photos front on it reflects obviously.
Here and here which makes my face look.
Wider and i like my face to look really.
Really wide and chisel because of my jaw.
Line i do have a very very long face so.
I like to kind of slim it down just the.
Slightest bit and this trick really.
Really helps and to make sure my.
Highlight and contour are nice and.
Blended together i'm gonna grab the mac.
Blush in the shade up pinch me and my.
Morphe morphe my morphe for bronze.
Alright so for the lipid ii doodahs.
Today i'm going to using a brand new.
Product for my sistas over at covergirl.
And those are the melting pout lipsticks.
They come in these cute little squeeze.
Tubes and there are a ton of different.
Shades i just picked out for that i.
Think might match i'm gonna do a little.
Bit of a swatch just do you want to look.
Good on the actual lips.
I feel like this nude shade number 105.
Is a little bit too a pinky for this.
Look umm let's test number 140 this.
Definitely could be really really pretty.
Honestly i think number 135 is a little.
Bit too much of a blue tone shade purple.
For this look so that one's gonna be a.
Now and then number 150 oh number 150.
Looks really good i definitely think i.
Want to go into the shade number 150 but.
Before i do that i'm gonna grab the.
Covergirl farewell feathering liner this.
Is also a new product and it's basically.
A lip liner but it's invisible and it.
Goes on and it stops here at liquid.
Lipsticks or any lipsticks from moving.
Around which is so so great then i'm.
Gonna go ahead and apply shade number.
150 oh yeah.
Okay so i actually really really like.
How this lip turned out it went on super.
Super smooth as you can see it is.
Obviously a liquid lipstick formula but.
It didn't write out an auto percent.
Matte which i don't mind as well it is a.
Dark ready cranberry shade which is.
Usually a red flag when it comes to.
Lipsticks because they usually are very.
Very patchy but with this the formula.
Actually looks really really consistent.
So these are definite winds for me as.
Well the lip liner is great as you can.
See my lip line is super smooth and.
Strong so i love it okay so finally to.
Finish off this look i'm going to grab.
My urban decay all nighter setting spray.
And give my.
They say quick little spritz alright.
Guys so that is this sunset cranberry.
Look i'll complete this definitely got a.
Lot more dark intense and vampy than i.
Originally anticipated i was going for a.
Little bit of a lighter eye at first but.
I actually really really like how this.
Came out as well i guess follows like.
Relatively soon i mean like i'm ready.
For spooky times and ready for pumpkins.
Halloween you name it so i guess we're.
Just jumping the gun a little bit but.
Who cares i like this look as well i.
