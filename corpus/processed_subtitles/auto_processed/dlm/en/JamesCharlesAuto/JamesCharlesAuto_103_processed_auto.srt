Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel so it.
Is officially fall season it is the end.
Of november and you know what that means.
It's thanksgiving i personally love.
Thanksgiving it is one of my all-time.
Favorite holidays i have not been home.
In over six months now since my senior.
Graduation so i am literally so pumped.
For once to hop on a plane and fly all.
The way back home to regular old open in.
New york and see my family i literally.
Missed them so so much i cannot wait to.
Give momma charles and sister ian and.
Daddy charles a oh whoa.
No oooh and father charles that was.
Almost really really bad i'm associated.
To get them all really really big hugs.
The point of thanksgiving is obviously.
To spend time with your family and.
Friends and be thankful and of course.
Eat a lot of really really great food.
I've been getting so many treats from.
You guys telling me that you guys are.
Going to different family thanksgiving.
Parties with a bunch of relatives that.
You have not seen in so so long so for.
Today's look i put together this funky.
Little cut crease moment perfect for the.
Thanksgiving feast and it's like the.
Smokey winged out bronzy little fall.
Moment we have bronze glitter on the lid.
And some very very intense fluffy lashes.
I just wanted to go very very extra.
Today so everybody at the dinner table.
Knows i am that    we're really going.
For the grandma charles to be like oh.
Sister you look so good why don't you.
Get in line for the thanksgiving feast.
First and i'll be like oh don't mind if.
I do all that being said if you guys.
Like to see how i created this final.
Little thanksgiving makeup tutorial keep.
On watching.
Music.
Alright guys let's go ahead and jump.
Right and this eye look is simply gonna.
Be pretty complicated and definitely a.
Lot going on today just like our.
Thanksgiving dinner plates we got the.
Stuffing at the mashed potatoes the.
Gravy the turkey and the whole shebang.
So i'm gonna be using the brand new.
Morpheus 39a dare to create palette i.
Absolutely love this palette i can't.
With the holiday collection that i.
Modeled for if you guys have not yet.
Seen my full-on review definitely click.
Somewhere up here i think if this is the.
Right side fingers crossed.
To check that video out i first got my.
M4 for one brush and dip into this.
Middle transition shade i actually lost.
A little sheet with the names on it so.
You're just gonna have to bear with me.
Today i'm just popping the shade right.
Up in the crease and blending it out.
Using windshield wiper motions and i'm.
Actually not topping off the brush.
Before i find this color we definitely.
Want this to be a very very vibrant and.
Pigmented and when we get to the outer.
Corner i am doing my all-time.
Favorite trick upholding that shadow out.
A little bit for the next color we're.
Gonna grab at our 39 brush and dip into.
This burnt orange shade right up in here.
I'm topping the shade right up in the.
Crease and normally what i would do.
Crease shade i would always hold the.
Brush like this completely parallel or.
Horizontal there we go to my face but.
For this i'm actually kind of holding.
The brush downwards to really get it up.
In that crease and make sure it doesn't.
Blend any higher we are gonna be cutting.
Out the crease today so it's okay for.
Everything gets on the lid because we're.
Gonna clean it up later and then same.
Thing with that outer corner i'm gonna.
Pull it out and like a nice little cut.
V-shape we are gonna be going from.
Really really light orange obviously in.
Our transition to really really deep.
Black in the crease area which you'll.
See in a few seconds but i am gonna be.
Blending in between every snap to make.
Sure that none of the colors get muddied.
It together i'm mexican i grab another.
Clean r39 brush this brush is basically.
The exact same was the m 4-3-3 so if you.
Have that one.
Feel free to dip into that one too or.
Literally any blending brush it's really.
Not that deep to this and burnt darker.
Orange shade right up in here but we are.
Just gonna want make sure every color we.
Go and we're using a smaller brush or.
Just a more defined motion to really.
Make sure that those colors are getting.
More and more dark and defined with each.
Time and once again not getting to money.
On next thing i got was smaller more.
Defined brush this is the m 507 and i'm.
Gonna dip into this like ready tone.
Brown shade up in here and i'm gonna use.
This to deepen up once again the crease.
And the outer v as you guys can see when.
Doing these style of looks it's really.
Really important to start off light and.
Build your way up darker and darker.
Using a smaller and smaller brush and.
Smaller motions each time because if you.
Start off with a dark color and just go.
Right in everything it's gonna look.
Really really wonky and unblended like.
Really really quickly so i know it may.
Seem like a lot of extremis i mean we've.
Already literally use for eyeshadow.
Colors and this doesn't even look like.
Much it yet but if you just take your.
Time and be patient this is really gonna.
Like help you with your makeup in.
General just starting off really really.
Slow and having patience will help you.
Make those iconic beautiful blend it out.
Smokey eyes so this is where things are.
Going to start to get more complicated.
More dark and more intense i'm gonna.
Grab my m14 9 brush which is this very.
Very tiny pencil brush and dip into the.
Black shade in the bottom corner and.
Uses to deepen out crease.
Or the outer v not the crease oh my god.
I just brought my mirror a little bit.
Closer obviously you guys know my.
Eyesight is not the pest i really want.
To make sure that this is very very.
Defined and precise cuz you guys know.
Adding a little bit too much block and.
Make an eye look go from real good to.
Real bad real fast so excuse the mirror.
In the video i'm gonna move it in a.
Second so with the block on the pencil.
Brush i'm gonna take this and i'm gonna.
Top it right into the outer of v we're.
Gonna cut this entire area out using a.
Shimmer shadow in a second but i do want.
To get all the color on there in the.
Right shape just like that so we can.
Blend it out at how the pigment still be.
There because like i said we don't want.
To add too much block but where there is.
The block we want it to be black if that.
Makes sense.
To blend that black out i'm gonna grab.
Miami five up seven brush once again and.
Dip into this cool tone a brown shade up.
In here and just lightly go over those.
Edges like i was saying adding a little.
Bit of black and quickly get too intense.
And i think this definitely just did so.
I'm gonna go to my r39 brush and dip.
Into that light orange shade from before.
And just go over those edges to.
Hopefully make everything a little bit.
Less dark alright so that is the lid all.
Complete like i said it did get a little.
Bit darker than i originally wanted it.
To but oh well i guess that's just what.
We're gonna have to deal with today now.
We're gonna go ahead and cut out the.
Crease i'm gonna grab my morphe cream.
Shadow in the shade copper today which.
Is this beautiful orange shade as the.
Base of course and then my makeup shock.
T57 brush it's just this tiny really.
Flat definer brush we are gonna be doing.
A lot more of like a detailed crease.
Today than the classic average half cut.
Crease where you just kind of blur out.
The edges so i do want to make sure it's.
Really really light and defined i know.
Some people really like to do a.
Concealer first when they're cutting out.
Creases but if you're using a pigmented.
Cream shadow i feel like it's really not.
That deep because you're just gonna.
Cover over top of it anyway and it does.
The same job so like why do you more.
Work if you don't have to you feel once.
Again talk about the mir but i'm gonna.
Lean in close early make sure i get this.
Exactly where i want it i'm just going.
To carve out this crease i'm just.
Wanting to send like normal but then.
Once i get to the outer corner instead.
Of just fading out the edges i'm.
Actually gonna pull this shout out once.
Again.
When that defined brush and i'm gonna.
Make kind of a loop back around to the.
Lower lash line this more rounded define.
Cut crease is a look that i've been.
Seeing a ton of people rock on instagram.
Lately but i've never actually tried so.
I just wanted to test that out today and.
Honestly i think it looks so stunning.
And really really cool and definitely.
Adds a more like avant-garde twist.
To the door euler half cut crease just.
For an extra little pop on top i'm gonna.
Grab the stila liquid metals and the.
Shade of bronze bell and just pat a.
Little bit of this over top of that.
Morphe cream eyeshadow i really want to.
Make sure this is dried down before i go.
In with any more shadow or anything else.
Obviously we don't any of that shadow to.
Transfer so the last and final step of.
My upper lash line today is actually.
Gonna be to grab the kat von d tattoo.
Liner in the shade of trooper and i'm.
Gonna really lightly outline at that.
Outer curve for lashes today i'm gonna.
Pop out a pair of how's the lashes.
Ikonics.
Then i'm just gonna blend together my.
Real lashes with the fake ones of course.
Using my benefit roller lash mascara.
Once the lashes are blended together i'm.
Gonna grab a black liner pencil and you.
Guys know i hate doing this but for.
Today's look i filet it as necessary i.
Really want this to be very very sexy.
And sultry.
I want everybody other things doing.
Doing our table to know that i am that.
That gets the turkey first i.
Really wanna be nice and intense.
It's been a long time since i've done.
That whoa.
For the lower last i'm gonna grab an.
Hour 30 and i'm brush and dip into the.
Bright orange shade and just run that.
All around the lower lash and then of.
Course i can sort of connect it at that.
Outer corner i'm gonna take my beauty.
Blender and dip into a little bit of my.
Chances at setting powder and i'm going.
To bake right underneath that shadow.
Because i think it's getting a little.
Bit too low there and like i said we do.
Want to keep this very very defined just.
Like that i'm just gonna grab any flat.
Top brush and i'm gonna dip into the.
Already brown shade and i'm gonna run.
That along the lower lash.
Wow finally i'm just gonna grab a flat.
Top rounded brush and use this to.
Highlight my brow bone using of course.
What other than my anasazi illuminator.
And so hollywood then same thing on a.
Pencil brush in that inner corner.
Alright guys metis one eye all complete.
I'm gonna go ahead and do the other one.
Off-camera quickly and i'll be right.
Back to finish off the rest of the lock.
Alright guys and those are both eyes all.
Complete i actually ended up taking off.
The electronics and switching them out.
For the lily lashes in the style sydney.
These are much more intense and.
Voluminous not gonna lie my eyes are a.
Little bit on code right now you guys.
Know i always do have to cut off a lot.
Of lash to make them work my eyes are.
Very very tiny but i feel like the.
Dramatic ness and the size of these just.
Really fits at this look so sister it's.
Gonna suck it up i already added a.
Little bit of highlighter earlier but i.
Feel like we are definitely not blending.
Enough i mean i'm trying to be on the.
Level of like aunt josephine is grabbing.
For the stuffing and we're like bam and.
She is literally so shocked that she.
Forgets about what she was doing and.
Then we get to snatch it up first i'm.
Gonna go in and lightly spritz my face.
Using the tatcha dewy skin mist just to.
Give the highlight or something to stick.
To and then i'm gonna grab of course.
You've gassed in my honest asya so.
Hollywood illuminator oh.
Aunt josephine is literally shaking she.
Just fell over alright guys and to.
Finish off this look today i'm gonna go.
Into the anasazi liquid lipstick in the.
Shade its sepia i'm not used as lip.
Color and so long but i felt like you.
Would pair perfectly with this look i.
Use it a few days ago for a chocolate.
And i literally fell back in love with.
It it is the kind of a brownie mouth.
Tone but it definitely does have some.
Purpley undertones which matched.
Perfectly with the reds in the eye look.
Today and i just like it pairs perfectly.
For this fall look and finally to finish.
This off i'm just gonna give my face a.
Good spritz using the scandinavia makeup.
Finishing spray.
