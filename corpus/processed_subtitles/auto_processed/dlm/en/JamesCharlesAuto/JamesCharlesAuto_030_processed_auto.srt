Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel as.
You guys can see today i'm joined with.
Two.
Very very special guests the developer.
Hi.
Hi i'm trying to look at the camera not.
At this.
I am so beyond excited because for.
Today's video we are doing something.
That i have not done in.
So so long now and that is a beauty.
Battle this is one of my favorite.
Segments that we do here on this youtube.
Channel but it has been a long time.
Because i have not had an iconic duo.
Such as the demilio sisters you know to.
Fight it out yay.
Do you guys have any idea what the.
Beauty bottles are um have you seen them.
Yeah i'll do one half of your face she.
Does the other one.
Sure and i win great she's probably.
Gonna win.
But i'm not gonna quit okay sure that's.
The good attitude to have.
So we already obviously filmed a.
Collaboration together where i did your.
Makeup do you think that's gonna give.
You an advantage in today's challenge.
I think that definitely helped as well.
As.
The fact that i've been watching your.
Videos for a long time and.
I know a lot of your tips and tricks.
Charlie watches videos and practices but.
I'm going to do my best i'm going to.
Make you look pretty that's all that.
Matters at the end of the day.
You already look pretty so just like.
Charlie said we're going to split my.
Face in half charlie will get one side.
And dixie will get the other and in the.
End it'll be up to you guys to decide.
Who did a better job climbing me up.
We're going to talk all about their rise.
To fame dixie's new music everything.
Going on with charlie and.
Also morphe 2 which is the brand new.
Natural beauty line that came out from.
Morphe with charlie and dixie are the.
Face of which is.
Super super exciting so if you guys want.
To see this beauty bottle keep on.
Watching.
Music.
So today oh my gosh all right you guys.
Let's go ahead and get.
Started.
We're starting off by using the brand.
New morphe 2.
Skin tint that's such a fun name before.
We even jump into anything like person.
With this video i want to talk about a.
Little bit about this line because this.
Is really exciting to me i know this is.
Morphe's like.
Natural beauty line right yeah i haven't.
Heard it too much about this because.
This is obviously a secret.
When we're filming this and this is.
Still secret it will be coming out very.
Soon.
So i'm going to let you guys tell me a.
Little bit about the line so basically.
For us we have always been.
Just put up i'm so scared we have always.
Been into.
A little bit more of a natural look.
Because i feel like that's what i really.
Enjoy wearing and.
Full glam is definitely out of my.
Comfort zone so.
When morphe showed us the collection it.
Was like everything that i had wanted.
And that was something that i.
Really enjoyed seeing so and like every.
Time we're in a meeting talking about.
How everything happened the first thing.
We say is charlie's natural and that's.
What people like they like seeing her.
Personality i mean i feel like there was.
A period in time on the internet for so.
Long where like.
Everybody was like full glam and i mean.
Hello obviously like i'm.
One to talk and like still very much my.
Style but more than ever especially with.
Tick tock there's a huge emphasis on.
Like natural beauty which i really.
Really like.
Like i was really excited when i heard.
About this line as well because like.
Sometimes i still want to get ready in.
The morning and look cute but like not.
Have.
Fallen on anymore i love the natural.
Makeup look.
Like on you really so much yeah like.
Even when i started on tik tok like i.
Would get people saying like she doesn't.
Wear any makeup and i'm like no i do.
It's just.
Very very natural because that's what i.
Like i also i'm a dancer.
And dancing with heavy makeup is.
Sometimes a lot that's why i've.
Literally stopped filming dancing tick.
Tocks with makeup on.
Because i'm awful at dancing.
And it takes me like 30 tries to.
Actually get the choreography down and.
By the end of it i'll be literally like.
Wet with sweat which is.
Disgusting it's so bad i just can't do.
It i mean i didn't even start wearing.
Makeup till.
Not even two years ago i would wear it.
To like dance competitions but that was.
Really it.
Because i i also didn't feel comfortable.
Going out with makeup on because i was.
Just.
So not like me but then i found products.
That really worked with.
The style that i was going for right how.
Was it working with morphe on the line.
I think everything the shoot was one of.
Our first.
Like big professional shoots like that.
So it was something really was it really.
That we were able to experience together.
That's so fun it was really cool seeing.
Everything come together.
Because we were putting on the.
Jelly shimmer well obviously this is a.
Project that you guys got to work on.
Together but one thing that i definitely.
Want to talk about since charlie and i.
Already did.
Our video dixie speaking of doing.
Separate things.
You just released your hit song called.
Mary's buddies just kidding it's called.
Being happy.
I want to hear all about it how was it.
How is the reaction been okay so.
I started recording um like a couple.
Months ago and this was the first song i.
Recorded and.
So i grew up singing and then it was.
Like when this all started happening.
My manager was in the music business and.
He was like if you grew up singing like.
You should sing.
Right oh no and then finally my dad was.
Like just do it like it's worth like.
There's no point in not trying it if i.
Don't sing in front of anyone like.
I heard you thinking like under your.
Breath a few times when we were hanging.
Out and i was like wait a second you're.
Like kind of.
Good i was like oh my gosh she's like.
Kind of it i literally had a panic.
Attack releasing the song or like.
Yeah in the videos i posted on take talk.
I would freak out and shut off my phone.
After i posted them.
As an influencer it is really hard.
Because of course you have a major.
Advantage when you release a song you.
Know it's going to be supported and.
That's an amazing thing.
But you're now opening up the song to.
Criticism from millions and millions of.
People.
Like that's why i haven't released a.
Song yet because like music is such a.
Huge part of my life but it's also one.
Thing that i made fun of so often.
Because there's so many awful videos of.
Me singing online so like if i was to.
Ever release music it would have to be.
Like the perfect.
And it's so easy to lose a passion for.
Something if everyone's like.
Yeah and that's what i didn't want to do.
Like i didn't want to take something i.
Enjoyed and share it and then lose the.
Passion for it because.
Of hate comments yeah personally i think.
It's a bop like i.
At first i was like oh this is like a.
Cute little song and stuff and then i.
Noticed that i literally was singing it.
Nonstop.
Like i was literally just sitting in the.
Kitchen like sometimes i don't wanna.
Be oh obviously the whole like bars nice.
Thing has become a meme but i love that.
You like joined in.
On it as well like at this point you.
Just have to know like people just.
Want to make jokes i don't like it.
Doesn't bother me experience she's a.
Singer.
Does this look good yeah it does um also.
Miss charlie.
You just hit 70 7-0 70 million.
Followers on tick-tock like that is.
Absolutely insane that's literally more.
Than the population of italy and the.
Population of france and the population.
Of australia and so.
To me how like is it even possible to.
Process that number i feel like.
In my head it's just like it's so weird.
To even think about that.
That's a literal country an actual.
Country that's crazy i want to ask you.
Guys as well because when we and charlie.
Last filmed our video.
You had like just gotten here but we.
Were visiting but now you guys are.
Officially moved in.
To l.a you're like girls like how is.
That and are you liking it so far.
Um i love living with my family like i'm.
Glad i came out here with them.
Because they'll keep me from being.
Stupid.
I like it um i mean i obviously miss my.
Hometown friends.
A lot at the same time i've been able to.
Make so many friends here and i.
Just i can't wait to bring them all.
Together and like see that happen.
Okay so charlie you're applying the.
Highlighter right yes this is the.
Face gloss look your face that way.
Oh that's kind of fun yes.
The lip gloss looks so good my lip gloss.
Is cool my lip glosses pop in.
That was before your time how can i i've.
Never said that sentence my entire life.
You said it backwards no wait what my.
Lip gloss is popping my lip gloss is.
Cool.
Did i say backwards oh before your time.
Did you ever dance like me actually oh.
Baby girl.
Have you seen my dick talks charlie do a.
Good interpretation of.
Dancing don't be rude.
My body literally does not move in that.
Way.
How would you guys describe your like.
Relationship living together.
And also working together the worst i.
Literally went into her room last night.
When she got home.
No to show her the clothes that i got.
For her.
And i opened the door and she closes the.
Door in my face but.
Yesterday morning i was sleeping my.
First day off in a very long time i was.
Sleeping it was.
Charlie's mad i was sleeping it's a.
Saturday morning and she goes.
Dancing knocking on the door super.
Exciting and i cared a lot.
To let her and it was something so.
Stupid oh my only problem with her she.
Doesn't apologize.
Oh god i shouldn't have to apologize no.
When you do things wrong you never.
Apologize until i forget.
I'm always like can you at least.
Apologize she goes i'm sorry.
Okay which is an apology but it's not a.
Real.
I don't know so really good is to answer.
That question no no no it's the best.
I like working together because we're.
Like there for each other because if.
People like like if we don't want to.
Speak up for ourselves on something like.
The other one can.
When we're like doing stuff if like i.
Don't know what's if i'm not like.
Comfortable don't like have a personal.
Experience with like whatever.
Like she can talk about it we don't.
Fight that much but when we do it's bad.
I see that all right well charlie and.
Dixie i guess that is this.
Beauty literal battle at this point all.
Complete.
Thank you guys so much for coming up.
Have my face how do you feel about your.
Finished locks.
For me i'd say that i'm very very proud.
Of it and i feel like.
The base super super natural which i.
Love but the eye i did a.
Little teensy bit of a glam moment i was.
Very very proud.
Sure they turned out great sure i think.
Mine's perfect.
