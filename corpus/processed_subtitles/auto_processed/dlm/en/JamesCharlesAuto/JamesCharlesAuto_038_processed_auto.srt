You don't mind before with covergirl.
Yeah and a very very long time i'll.
Never forget that i that day that i.
Discovered i said he's gonna be such a.
Big star yeah so i have i have like a.
Good night for like discovering or like.
Knowing who's gonna be really sweet.
You're the past what we want to do to.
That um i don't know.
I fix out i'm so used to talking to a.
Crowd of people at the classes yeah.
Weird cuz i want to ask them but i can't.
Do you guys want glamour you guys what.
Natural i feel like we should do a glam.
Look especially using the palette just.
Because i don't have so many colorful.
Lugs iphones like we go you can do.
Rainbow they want to see something.
Pretty alright like you're cool so when.
I start doing makeup and especially it's.
A new client which you basically are.
Right now because i've never done your.
Makeup i just started to start feeling.
The features of the face and kind of.
Just envisioning the techniques i'm.
Gonna be doing that when hair has to go.
High or lower so as i'm gonna start by.
Filling your eyebrows and while i'm.
Doing that i'm gonna start kind of.
Planning a look cause right now i have.
No idea what i'm doing that's honestly.
How i go into most of my makeup looks as.
Well it's the hardest part for people.
Whatever they do you have such a good.
Transformation they were disgusting are.
You thinking i don't know and the thing.
Is - so everyone told me that they were.
Bad there was not a single person like.
Within the makeup community be like oh.
Yeah your eyebrows are good like.
Everyone's like aha correct like even.
Though i saw see leslie crazy no one.
Says when i first grew a moustache that.
Two years ago it was literally like so.
Long hitting my lips and when i look at.
Pictures i cringe oh how did no night my.
Family i told me like oh you need to.
Trim your mustache.
Cuz nobody wants to be mean but i wish.
More people had bullied me about my.
If i was close to you at that time i.
Would okay god i kind of go back to the.
Browser throughout the qualification.
Really the reason i do this because i'm.
Depends on how elektra might be i make.
Up is like if i make up a super dramatic.
And i don't want to go too heavy on the.
Girls so i could have just do like a.
Midway point with the browser okay so do.
You want to tell the sisters a little.
Bit about like how long do you think.
Make up for like your education and.
Training and stuff just so they don't.
Like a little bit more about so i.
Started make up in 2000 so it's gonna be.
19 years now.
Oh my god 1990 yeah wow 14 1999 5 yeah.
19 so he was like four months old when i.
Started doing makeup oh my god that is.
Insane that's so cool though like just.
The level of success that you've reached.
And the fact that you've been doing it.
For home no only three years oh sorry.
Okay i hate talking about myself i.
Started doing makeup 19 years ago yeah.
In new york and i got a job at sephora.
When i was 17 as a fragrance consultant.
And i started doing makeup there it's.
Where i discovered makeup in the first.
Day of work and i got obsessed with it.
Fell in love with it started researching.
It and at this time in the industry is.
It's very different than it was than it.
Is now yep we want to talk about it was.
Like really really hard back then you.
Could not there was there was no social.
Media there was no way to get noticed.
And so i started working retail and then.
You know i really struggled i want to.
Say for the first like seven or eight.
Years and when i say struggle i mean.
Like barely being able to pay rent you.
Know like eating pizza and eating tuna.
Fish and like it was hard because you.
You had to assist and a lot of those.
Systems all you had to do for free right.
So you'd be on set for like 16 or 18.
Hours a day working with these masks and.
Makeup artists but you know you'd be.
Doing it for free for the experience hot.
Well that's how it was and then you know.
I'd work for each on the side and then.
When i eventually stopped retail i.
Started working like in television news.
On the weekends just i can make you know.
Some steady income brahe started doing.
My own clients started working with.
Photographers and eventually like i want.
To say after the six years so i started.
Doing like celebrities in new york some.
Pop singers and some actresses how did.
That happen cuz i sleep that's a very.
Like intense to over like starting us.
Before i just testing and playing it out.
To like news anchors that i'm also.
Produces like a something yeah pretty.
Intense job it just whoa no it wasn't it.
Wasn't like an attention shop it was.
Very like gradual gradual it was like.
Little by little just like step by step.
Yeah working with a certain hair size.
Who recommend me to the celebrity you.
Know that practing but i also had an.
Agent at that time so i hadn't featured.
Since i was 21 but even within agent lee.
You know you still struggle at that time.
Yeah because to get noticed by a.
Celebrity there was just no way like.
Nowadays you could just write them on.
Them social media right twitter or.
Instagram which is helpful and they can.
Definitely discover you're nowadays -.
Back then there was just no way at all.
You know the industry has definitely.
Changed you mention how the industry has.
Like changed a lot when it comes to like.
Artists and now like the emergence of.
Social media and there's no denying that.
You were like one of the first to really.
Pioneer like makeup on social media you.
Have a huge following on instagram.
And like your work is major inspiration.
To me and many other artists as well.
Would you say that social media has.
Changed to make impunity for the better.
And in what ways do you think it's like.
A factor that it's interesting for me to.
Answer this question because i am.
Considered the old school like anyone.
Who's like 15 years in the business and.
More is considered sort of all its glory.
Yeah and most of the people that are old.
School they tend to not like social.
Media and they think it's ruined and.
They think it's ruined the industry and.
They think that youtube is ruined and.
Influencers everyone did there's a huge.
That's a huge thing yeah it's a it's a.
Really big thing i feel like i'm gonna.
Also get it you know when this video.
Comes out because like people gonna turn.
Their nose up right you know why would.
He do that with the influencer you know.
But for me i mean i feel like instagram.
Is amazing number one i feel like it's.
Changed in the street for the better for.
Me definitely and for many others as.
Well it provides it's provided so many.
More opportunities that we never would.
Have had as makeup artists so many more.
Like types of jobs that we can do and.
You know just the fact that you could.
Build a following you could you could.
Share your work and have control over it.
You know instagram is like a personal.
Magazine right and so you could share.
Your work and build a following build a.
Business a legitimate business million.
Precise yeah and for me i've always been.
Sort of supportive of influencers in.
Youtubers for one because i know the.
Amount of work that goes into what you.
Guys do i think.
People don't realize you know in the.
Older generation in particular and even.
Some of the newer generation they don't.
Realize the amount of work that goes.
Into doing a youtube ad you're creating.
Content and you know it's like it's.
Really a full-time job and i think.
Someone like you in particular who i.
Really like admire when it comes to work.
Ethic you know i can see the amount of.
Work that you put into it you know the.
Fact that you're able to build a.
Following by the way i think you.
Probably get the award for the most.
Insane engagement like you've literally.
Grows like a billion dollars every three.
Days the same you know but that's like.
To me like i don't look at that as like.
Uh you know i look at that as like holy.
Crap that's amazing like yeah it's.
Inspiring you know what i mean the work.
Is there you know to back it up because.
You're working on stuff even on your.
Days off i feel like you're plotting and.
Planning and thinking of your next video.
And yeah you know you're entertaining to.
Watch on social media and i think that's.
Really hard not everyone can do that.
Thank you.
And so i have respect for you and for.
All the other content creators out there.
You know because it really is a hard job.
And people don't realize like how much.
Goes into it and my other thing about it.
Is that because the industry has changed.
Right so there's all these kind of new.
Opportunities for these young artists.
That are coming up.
I've also look at that as just because i.
Had to struggle for like almost 10 years.
In the beginning of my career and now.
People don't like i feel like i i'm.
Happy for them because yeah they have.
These cool opportunities now like if it.
Was my brother or my cousin or my son.
You know and these opportunities came.
Their way and they're 18 and 19 i'm not.
Gonna tell them to sit in the room and.
Say no to everything i'm gonna say go.
Take the opportunities go get on.
Successful go with it you know and i.
Feel like that's how people should think.
About it as well i've only been in the.
Community for 3 years now but obviously.
Cover garlic was a major pivotal moment.
And boys and beauty i feel like cause it.
Really bought it to like the mainstream.
Media and even over the past three years.
I've seen such a positive change and so.
Many young boys trying out makeup and.
Imagine me being like oh no like you.
Can't like being mad that they were.
Getting a following or imagined that you.
Said no to covergirl right i hate.
Wouldn't makeup artists like oh.
Influencers are taking our jobs like.
When have you ever seen me on set like.
Doing makeup for a campaign.
Unless it's my own ever yeah but we it's.
Two totally different things than i.
Don't understand why there's so much.
Hatred between people living within the.
Same industry that are just performing.
Different tasks i mind my own business.
I'm in my own studio making contests for.
A younger demographic and working makeup.
Artists are on set every single day.
Working just as hard doing celebrity.
Makeup and doing like shoot and client.
Talent campaign and sometimes like.
Sometimes our worlds collide you know.
Like a celebrity makeup artist like when.
They do oscars for grammys you know they.
Work with the same brands that you guys.
Do because they're they're getting.
Sponsored by brands for their red carpet.
Looks so if sometimes the worlds collide.
And i just feel like there needs to not.
Be a divide between the open generation.
And the younger i feel like i just feel.
Like people needs to support support it.
More not bash everyone can learn from.
Each other yeah look i feel like i've.
Learned so much from you and from other.
Industry professionals that i've looked.
Up to have been falling for a very very.
Long time like it's people like you.
People like anasazi there are people.
That have like really been a great.
Mentor to me to give me advice and be.
Like hey listen i have been here for 19.
Plus years don't do that or like you.
Should do that so you should talk to.
This person like i really value that.
Because as much as i love makeup and.
Marketing and stuff there's always.
Things that i can learn and improve on.
And the same thing goes with the older.
Generation like just like you said.
Social media has been a huge emergence.
In the community and i think it's really.
Changed it for the better but obviously.
A lot of the older generation is that a.
Touch of that and i think that there's a.
Lot to be learned from them even for the.
Working making purpose how they can.
Build their brand further and still book.
Those jobs and not how to be taken by.
Influencers you have two options you.
Either you get with it and you you kind.
Of go with the change and you pay.
Attention to your social media and you.
Work on it you become part of it because.
It's not going anywhere it's not going.
Anywhere no one has control over that.
And so you either do that or you just.
Kind of get left behind some of the.
Older makeup artists have resorted to.
Like sort of publicly bashing and and.
Shaming or you know bullying certain.
Even within the middle every to make.
Parts community like some celebrity.
Members do it to other celebrity make.
Parts to think about if they have a lot.
Of followers or if they have you know if.
They work with certain clients and i.
Just feel like you know for someone who.
Has 20 plus years of experience let's.
Say a makeup artist.
To have your legacy be that you were.
Known for bashing people and for.
Bullying people you know on social media.
Like that's just horrible for me and i.
Built a thing it's embarrassing yet and.
So i just feel like we need to respect.
Each other's feels and each other's jobs.
Or they call it the beauty community but.
I feel like it needs to be more of a.
Community grade kind of said any better.
Myself so i'm doing a i call it a snatch.
I can't leave you've never done this no.
Okay.
So obviously taping his eyes back and.
I'm going to be tying it in the back.
With a string and what that does is it.
Enables it pushes the eyes back this is.
A very very old hollywood trick it's.
Been done for so long in hollywood and.
Movies and filming and red carpets and.
Stuff i might do this i do this pretty.
Let me not often but i do it quite a bit.
Especially on photo shoots and you could.
Do it on a red carpet - if the hair is.
Down because it clevers it yeah a lot of.
Celebrities do it you know we just don't.
Know why planes do it a little jack.
Needs of course yeah me for sure though.
That dries and then i basically pull.
That oh my god you can really even see.
It yeah you got to do it really clean.
You know sometimes you could see it a.
Lot and you can actually cover it with.
Makeup.
I mean you will we're gonna see this.
Though in the video but you know we're.
Doing a fantasy it's like more for the.
Photo i mean so let me see something.
Like that let me pull it and it just.
Kind of snatches the face in the brows.
We put one of my double chin a lifetime.
Supply and i was on a video lately when.
You do some clients thing i just said.
Transform to another four day to really.
Feel it you know you mean like yeah it's.
Like anything i mean it's literally.
Getting a facelift without any of the.
Surgery at all like just a facelift and.
They just feel like so snatched and.
Beautiful hell of my face left at age 19.
Yeah oh all right so now because the.
Reason why i did this on him cuz i.
Wanted that was kind of envisioning like.
A black line like sort of like i'm never.
Gonna.
They learned okay i just felt like the.
Brows need to be lifted on the corners.
So i'm using a palette for the first.
Time what this so i have one of these he.
Sent it to me but i didn't use it in.
Touch it yet because i think i swatched.
One color but i'm saving it so there are.
Certain products that i save for the.
Future because i think in like 20-30.
Years you'll be super iconic and i wanna.
Make sure i have them like on touch so.
Yeah yours is one of them so you get the.
Send me another one guys okay well.
Alright so we'll probably work in these.
Ranges here it's more natural like i.
Said people don't see me do rainbow.
Rainbow rainbow but nobody has really.
Seen me do like glam with it yet so this.
Perfect well speaking of learning new.
Tips and tracks your masterclass so fun.
So fresh i went to one she did so i flew.
All the way to new york for you got a.
Mom i yes i did i was so excited to see.
Mario because we had met several times.
When i had always been good friends but.
I never think i actually gotten to.
Seeing you work before so super super.
Excited but i walked with my little.
Notepad like ready of my little time to.
Take notes of everything but it was such.
A cool experience getting to watch you.
Work and seeing you play i'm kim and all.
Like the different tips and techniques.
That you've been using forever like it.
Was so fun i feel like i learned so much.
I think people don't realize it's a lot.
More than just technique it's up to.
Because i feel like the majority of.
People that are there are aspiring many.
Mores right or there are make smart is a.
Different level some of them are.
Youtubers it some of them are you know.
The lot of them do brides and they you.
Know they're out there and hustling and.
Doing clients everyday and stuff like.
That so they learn like more so than.
Just techniques they really learn how to.
Approach like different face shapes and.
How to think about approaching a face.
And how to do certain different looks.
And how to build and how to you know.
It's a very very intense people when.
People don't realize that i think they.
Think in the beginning that it's just.
Kind of like a technique.
Thing you know but it's literally five.
Hours on one face so you can imagine the.
Amount of like info that's that's.
Happening it's a lot it's a little.
Spoiler alert for me it's the most.
Important part and the most you know the.
Part of my job that i'm like hands-down.
The most passionate yeah because i.
Wanted to be a teacher my entire life.
Yeah so i've sort of found the way to.
Become a teacher and a make worse at the.
Same time how long have you been doing.
The classes for i started the master.
Class almost tenured almost ten years.
Earlier in la so there was a youtube.
Video 10 years ago that kim and i put on.
Youtube.
And you know obviously kim she around.
That time she was really like starting.
To become heavily like a beauty icon.
People were girls are on the world and.
Really not enough to her they loved.
Their her glam looks and so after that.
Video came out i started getting.
Messages from people around the world.
Basically just asking me questions and.
Asking me like how can i do this or how.
Can i advance in this or what i'm like.
What are the steps i need to do right.
You know to become successful and so i.
Was sitting at home one day and i just i.
Was like wow like all of these people.
But unless they started assisting.
Someone because this is before youtube.
Was really a thing unless they start.
Assisting someone and unless they live.
In london paris new york or la they'll.
Never have a chance.
Yeah and so that's when i decided to do.
This class i was like let me teach them.
The tricks of the trade in this class.
And what i believe to be able to have.
Bands right and so my first class had.
Like 16 students in it yeah i started.
Like really small and now there are.
Thousands yeah and that's how the master.
First started but it's like literally.
Did you know i'm just so one thing i'm.
Like extremely proud of in my career.
Alright so i'm gonna just now set using.
The laura mercier translucent powder i'm.
Just gonna set the concealer i'm just.
Very lightly i'm not gonna do it too.
Much alright so i'm taking the shady to.
Ring light which is a beautiful that's.
Good.
Taking this heat ring light and i'm just.
Gonna put that on the inner corner here.
You mark your palate with the james.
Trials and morphe palette i really like.
This color anybody's yeah it's really.
Bright so i really love it for a good.
Like problem in our corner highlight.
Nobility it builds nicely too and then.
I'm gonna take a flatter brush i'm gonna.
Use ring light again but i'm actually.
Gonna mix it with where's this one i.
Want to so god i'm gonna mix green light.
And so good together and i'm just gonna.
Put it on the highest.
Where are your favorite table looks to.
Do on people or what's your look you've.
Ever done.
No i mean there's been thousands yeah.
Are to say but you know like also a.
Miniature with the you to it's like your.
Work changes over the years and.
Sometimes you can look at your old.
Working like you know yeah it always.
Changes my chemically my favorite look.
So he's changed what's your favorite.
Right now like that you felt like.
Recently okay if that's easier.
I mean there's one that i did on kim for.
Like her her glam bible campaign i'd.
Really lie up with the lake the.
Lightning-rod going to yeah that was so.
Pretty i like that one i'm anybody now.
Usually deeper shade to go over that.
Consumer what is this call is ten.
Percent off you know i'm really.
Impressed that you can remember it like.
That means you really like you were.
Really intensely involved because yeah i.
I mean i have bad memory wouldn't.
Memorize all these names the palate.
Literally like when i approach my morphe.
So you do the palate i already had it.
Fully designed on photoshop like with.
All the same names included as well we.
Sent me that photo something i remember.
Before it launched it was like a picture.
Of i did yes i remember tax to be like.
What would you add to this i was trying.
To get a lot of people that i respected.
The opinions of like input on the.
Palette before it launched because i.
Really col that obviously was to make it.
For working artists and for like all.
Makeup lovers i remember being at your.
House of a bunch of wind up in the.
Downtown and i remember trigger and i.
Remember you were working on it back.
Then.
Yeah you know you were kind of was.
Testing out some of the shadows with you.
But they were actually really amazing.
Back then too so i'm just gonna probably.
Do kind of do direction it's going right.
Now there's like very blown out smokey i.
Love cut creases everything to i really.
Appreciate them and stuff but i just.
Don't for me i personally my aesthetic.
My response i think is more of a blown.
Out like a really blown out and blend it.
Up a look because it's it for me it's.
More sexy and i love sexy makeup yes and.
So probably just gonna wind up doing.
That i want to ask you the question.
Because after leasing this palette i.
Haven't asked literally eighteen million.
Times.
Speaking of creating a palette or would.
You ever be interested in doing.
A marginal effect makeup line yeah i.
Mean that's been my goal for like 17 18.
Years i think it didn't happen the.
Future of you know i don't have any.
Solid dates or anything like that but.
It's something i've been slowly very.
Slowly working on the past three or four.
Years myself yeah it's a lot of work a.
Lot of work a lot of money obviously i.
Get offers like a lot of offers from.
Investment firms and huge companies and.
Investors and corporations and retailers.
To do lines with them right but i really.
Want to do it myself.
Without any investment yeah so i could.
Be fully in full control a bit and which.
I think of stowe cuz i would do the same.
Thing yeah so i'm not sure when it's.
Gonna happen i'm really not gonna rush.
It's gonna start out small you know.
Slowly kind of grow it from there but i.
Don't care about you know rushing it or.
You know just coming up to market.
Because instagram is hot right now you.
Know i love that yeah i'm just gonna do.
It when it's right and when when it's.
Ready yeah i i really really love that.
In that i mean obviously not hard i.
Respect you but that just makes me.
Respect you so much warren's doing some.
Cream product here just to tune so it's.
To face this is my i think this is my.
Favorite color image better color really.
I love i just love a matte color that.
Has that like yellowish undertone uh-huh.
No a lot of medium and darker skin tone.
People have been using it for banana.
Powder yeah which i think is so cool.
This would be a great color for a deeper.
Skin tone to kind of put on their eyes.
Yeah like yep alright so this looks all.
Pretty oh my god so this is one layer of.
Liner people always get shocked at the.
Classes like because i typically would.
Score it by layers upon their for one.
Look.
Music.
So i'm gonna just go ahead now and start.
Your skin i'm so excited for this but.
I'm gonna put more i'll do more liner.
And lashes in everything a little later.
Are you excited let's good because i.
Used to have really bad skin growing up.
And for me like i love doing eyes but.
Like i know that i can slay it ah you.
Know what i mean so like skin for me.
It's always like a fun challenge because.
I always like my skin to look like as.
Perfect as possible and it's been like.
Such a learning process for me.
Throughout me they kept routine because.
I used to cake on all my palettes but i.
Feel like i've gotten a lot better at.
Like still using a lot but like making.
It look a lot prettier in a lot like.
Right better both in real life and on.
Camera too so it's i always love seeing.
How different artists do skin feels like.
I feel like that's the one area that i.
Can always really really learn more.
About yeah.
So that being said should we do the.
Cutie like the juniors like dark orange.
Accommodation or sugar do they coming.
From like an hour i'm literally nars.
From my spray tan so the good lankans.
Well i've always had a lot of trouble of.
Matching my foundation because my like.
Body is pretty yellow tone but my like.
Neck and chest are like literally like.
Yeah my god why are you so perhaps use i.
Actually go dark with conditional i.
Almost get like who cares i've given up.
I'm give like who cares all right.
Sisters so that is officially every.
Single foundation that i now own when.
It's watched on both my face and my neck.
And chest sure didn't concealer before.
Foundation yes yes ma'am how long would.
You say like your normal paint on.
Somebody else it's always different.
Because it depends on like the situation.
You're in we write in some lip some.
Clients want it done fast like 30.
Minutes and some clients give you two or.
Three hours oh so it really depends on.
The client also dependent under the.
Circumstance i people don't realize like.
When you're doing a when your celebrity.
Make words like the type of conditions.
You're working under.
Usually every day there are pretty good.
Times intense yet like it's never i.
Never will have someone ever ever ever.
Like this that's just like quiet no.
Phone like you know calm yeah always.
They're on their phone their head is.
Down their publicist is early during an.
Interview they have their kids there.
They're getting their toes and their.
Hands down they're getting their hair.
Blown yeah i mean a wig puts you know.
Put in or extensions right so it's.
Really like intense moving and let them.
Moving if you never get to have someone.
Sitting still and so you know that's.
Just the reality of it and so like.
That's just how how the work is.
Typically every day so just keep that in.
Mind everyone when you're judging you.
Know and then they go on the red carpet.
Of course everyone judges and right you.
Know but it's fine i mean it's pretty.
Bad you like working under pressure.
Sometimes i get three hours and.
Sometimes i get 15 minutes it just.
Depends what is really an ideal.
Situation would it be like calm where.
You just get to like say and play yeah i.
Mean i would like i'm a very calm person.
So i like i like it when i could just.
Kind of focus and you know not not be.
Too rushed let me get that being said.
Like when i'm rushed i usually do really.
Good work you know when time came 9 to.
10 minutes oh lightly that it laid in.
New york this was many years ago we were.
At mtv as she was wearing a black.
Television and we had 10 minutes to do.
Four full hair and makeup and i made it.
Work lashes everything you know another.
Time i remember i've had some crazy.
Experiences another time i remember i.
Did this was back in here also the.
Celebrity arrived late to the hotel room.
And we had to go to an event in.
Manhattan and we were in jersey or.
Hotels in jersey and so we had that's.
Mistake number one.
Whoever booked her hotel there i'm not.
Sure why she was in jersey i think she.
Had another job in jersey or something.
Ok ok so we had to run into the car you.
Know this is like a years ago before i.
Had an assistant so like i had to pack.
Everything myself.
We had run-ins in the car and she put.
Her head on my lap in the car in the.
Back seat in the dark it was dark.
Outside we put that little light up on.
The car yeah and i did her entire face.
With her laying in the backseat on top.
Of my oh and actually the futures game.
It was like the most fulfilling moments.
When that stuff happened.
You've been weakened for 19 years now.
You see the trends come and go what.
Would you say are like your staple.
Makeup trends that you're just like live.
For and actually don't love makeup.
Trends i'm not a huge follower of trends.
But yes for me it's only because the.
Type of makeup that i have to do every.
Day like i'm not allowed to just do.
Trends like i have to just do what they.
Want sort of what looks best on them but.
That being said like recently for.
Example there's been a huge trend of.
Glitter right haha glitter and like bold.
Colors and so i've been doing all that.
Because sort of when people see.
Something on social media everyday.
Celebrities you know like they it's.
Almost like they become accustomed to it.
And so it becomes okay a little bit yeah.
Which is super dull you know like i'm.
Even finding that the clients are like.
Let's do glitter let's do a pink eye you.
Know this you know things like that so.
That being said even though i don't love.
Trends and because i took oligo can't.
Follow them i really appreciate them.
It's like one of those questions that.
Editors always ask like oh what trans -.
Hey it's like i don't hate any of them.
There's all they're all fun and bright.
You know it's like makeup it's all fun.
Well that leads me into a good question.
That i was actually getting ready to add.
There's no perfect sisters right i'm.
Gonna say obviously like you've been the.
Pioneer of so in different makeup trends.
Like how i think i'll try it but have.
There been any like techniques or like.
Tricks that you've learned from other.
Influences are artists that you have.
Influenced it and now you use all the.
Time well let me first clear this up.
Because this is controversial i didn't.
Create or invent highlighting contouring.
Specifically contouring because they.
Call me the contour king go applause.
Yeah contouring has been around i mean.
Mona lisa its contoured in her vanity.
You know it's been around for ages.
Drag queens always did contouring myself.
With kim really popularized it in the.
Digital mainstream or on the mainstream.
Yeah you know when i was an assistant.
For several years i learned so many.
Tricks of the trade from like literally.
The best networks in the world i knew.
Like so many of those things at a young.
Age because i was seeing them every day.
On set things like contour highlight.
Obviously like just all tech like cut.
Creases like all that stuff i learned or.
Like how to do the tapes and yeah how.
Did remove eyebrows all these kind of.
Things i learned i learned more so i.
Think from regular women like i'm really.
Interested in seeing how regular women.
Do their makeup and i think there's.
Something extremely charming and cute i.
Love seeing regular women's makeup.
Because i kind of like in my mind let's.
Say you know if i see someone in the.
Restaurant or something i never judge.
But like i'll see something look at it.
And i'll kind of like create something.
In my mind from what they did at home.
Yeah.
And then as far as like influencers and.
Stuff like that i just get i gets part.
Of it you know they do really cool.
Different things you have packing you.
What is your favorite step off the.
Makeup retained okay i know what miley's.
Fingers are why some of these favorites.
Are lashes same hundred verse i hate.
Doing lashes obviously despise that.
Especially you know false lashes and the.
Hands are big so it's like just annoying.
For me to get in there i don't love.
Doing lips either same hey absolutely.
Hating let's do some other people too.
It's so hard.
Yes especially the dark colors yeah my.
Favorite would be probably it depends on.
The face like if someone has amazing.
Eyes enemy eyes you know if someone has.
Like like incredible skin and i would.
Love doing this i always like a peachy.
Blush gonna dip into face what is it.
Face face a sea.
So for you so go down the lap so i can.
Shut up yeah i want to know because they.
Feel like the people who watch me it was.
Very like split i definitely valid or.
Makeup but i also have a lot of really.
Amazing and talented aspiring makeup.
Artists so as someone who's been in the.
Space for so long it's been a role model.
To so many of us what would be your.
Biggest piece of advice to aspiring.
Artists well if you want to be you know.
Something if you want to grow in your.
Career and you want to be successful i.
Think one of the most important things.
Is just sacrifice you're gonna have to.
Sacrifice you're not gonna be able to go.
On vacations constantly go out to the.
Clubs and the bars everyday air and.
Every weekend you know you have to put.
In the work in order to see the results.
And so that's number one my sacrifices a.
Tremendous amount yeah and then my mom.
Always taught me you know brooklyn.
Another country she wasn't allowed to go.
To school you know so she's a very.
Simple had a woman.
What she did teach me always that i.
Followed always is just to be a good.
Person and i always tell my students.
That no matter what you do and the.
Decisions that you make and the way you.
Lead your life delhi.
Just remember to really be able person.
You're making decisions do it from a.
Good place in your heart and you know.
She always said if you if you'd be a.
Good person marry well.
Everything good will come to you.
Sometimes they may take years sometimes.
Days but it will go all right so i think.
