Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel.
I am so suited for this video because.
Today we are sitting down and we are.
Doing our next installment of the mini.
Makeover series this series has been so.
Much fun to film and if you have nobody.
What i'm talking about.
Make shave like right up here to see the.
First two episodes of the series where i.
Get my makeup done at sephora and then.
Mac and then for today's video we're.
Going to alta to get a fault glam.
Makeover fedley reminder that at 8.
Different makeover we're asking for this.
Look that is on this photo of a.
Jacqueline hill it is the perfect bronze.
E glittery smokey eye for this fall.
Season and it's not too hard but also.
Not too easy of a makeup look to.
Recreate for these various artists after.
Every single makeover we're going to.
Come right back here and show you guys.
The finished look and then discuss it.
And remember the point of this is not to.
Drag or pick apart any artists work it.
Is simply to show you guys what i would.
Have done differently if it were me so.
You guys can make an educated decision.
Back at home if you want to go get your.
Makeup done for a special event and.
Don't forget to stay tuned for the.
Finale of this mini series where i do.
This makeup look on myself and my.
Personal style using all my favorite.
Products and i talk to you guys about.
What i would really recommend overall.
After going to all these different.
Makeovers and yeah i'll write guys with.
All that being said if you're from the.
System head up make sure to go give this.
Video a big thumbs up down below let's.
See if we can get this to 50,000 thumbs.
Up and let's head over to ulta to get a.
Glam makeover so walking into also today.
30 i showed up at about.
225 and was seated right away so that.
Was really really great.
They were definitely right on time and.
Ready to start working which i loved i.
Was told by the manager running the glam.
Counter today that my artist was gonna.
Be darrell and he came out and.
Introduced himself he was so so sweet.
And nice and i'm gonna leave his.
Instagram right up in here so make sure.
You go check it out and show him some.
Love so the first thing that my artist.
Said today was apply some moisturizer.
And he used the peter thomas roth.
Moisturizer i was so excited about this.
Because you guys know the sister james.
Loves her moisturizer i literally.
Moisturize my skin like two or three.
Times a day it is so salt vital to have.
Clear and healthy skin so i love a good.
Moisturizer especially before i put on a.
Lot of heavy cakey makeup next terrell.
Asked me about my skin and i told him it.
Was combination two now getting a little.
Bit dry because the weather changed and.
He looked really really closely and.
Picked up these smashbox pore minimizing.
Primer to apply over top of the.
Moisturize.
But under the foundation as a nice.
Primary base i am definitely not proud.
Of my pores i try to pretend like.
They're not there and i wish they.
Weren't there but i was definitely.
Really happy today to see that my artist.
Did recognize them and do his best to.
Cover them up and smooth them over for a.
Smooth foundation application after the.
Primer was all set in place he went in.
And used the anasazi abroad to find her.
To start defining and slaying my brows i.
Hid the brows in the mirror i really.
Really like the shape - my artist went.
With i feel like they arched the way i.
Like them the tail isn't too long and.
They have a nice shape to them i do wish.
However they were a little bit cleaner i.
Think the lines could be a little bit.
Smoother especially on the top and there.
Are few places that i would have.
Definitely spoolie through or added a.
Little bit more product to just make.
Them more even throughout but i don't.
Think they're bad by any means next my.
Artist probably ions using the tar.
Shaved cave concealer which we'll get to.
In a little bit and then he started in.
With the eye shadow and for today's eyes.
Shadow palette he chose that anasazi up.
Monitor - on ashley palette which i was.
So so excited for because it is one of.
My all-time favorite palettes he first.
Served it by playing some orange.
Transition shades and really blended.
Them out very very well looking close up.
The blend for the transition shades and.
The crease are really really nice it.
Looks very very seamless and even leaves.
A lot of room for the brow bone.
Highlight which i love i really can't.
Stand with eye shadow goes all the way.
Up to the eyebrow it just is really.
Really what do i make up pet peeves.
Sorry i really like the way he applied.
The shadow today so next about it with.
More tart shaped a concealer on a flat.
Top concealer brush and started to carve.
Out my eyelid for a cut crease i was.
Very excited to see him do this because.
You guys know a half-cup creases of my.
All-time favorite makeup styles and he.
Was actually the only artist to actually.
Define a crease with concealer before.
Applying the gold shadow on the lid java.
I think was definitely rocking a half.
Cut crease in her look so i think that.
By him doing this by far but it has.
Looked the most accurate to the original.
For the actual gold i'm the lady used.
One of the gold shadows from the lorac.
Gold eyeshadow palette and looking at.
The shadow close-up i think that this.
Gold on this particular look it's.
Probably the most accurate to what.
Jacqueline's original color was i really.
Really like the shade of gold i feel.
Like it's not too orange and it's not.
Too yellow either it's a very very.
Pretty in the middle shade that is.
Perfect for this look however looking at.
This actual crease close-up i feel like.
The shape is a little bit weird for my.
Eyes i do wish she would have made it.
More rounded following my natural eye.
Crease i feel like it is really really.
High up and.
Which for some reason which doesn't.
Exactly flatter me the most and as well.
I do feel like in the actual like middle.
Crease region the line is a little bit.
Messy i do wish it was a little bit more.
Defined but it's really not that big of.
A deal i was just happy to see him doing.
A cut crease once the eye shadow was all.
Complete he decided to skip lashes for.
Now and come back to it later on and.
Then we went on with the base for my.
Foundation today he went ahead and up.
Hide the two-faced before this way.
Foundation which i was so excited about.
You guys know the vorlons mate it's on.
My all-time favorites i always mix it.
With my george armani luminous silk or.
Layer on top of my makeup forever ultra.
Hd stick so i was so so pumped to see.
Him using this he applied the shade to.
Natural beige today which looked really.
Really great in the store with the.
Lighting in there but i will say looking.
At it now looks absolutely awful to his.
Defense i will say that in the store.
Letting the shade match did look really.
Good.
So i don't think this is a fair thing to.
Bash him on at oh i don't know what it.
Is with these make up stories and having.
The artist do makeup and this awful ass.
Lighting but we really need to get like.
Rain lights lay it up mirrors or.
Something because having this foundation.
Look perfect in store and then having me.
Walk out and look like this it's really.
Really not ok and genuinely worries me.
For any of you guys going here makeup.
Done that's just so bad and nobody wants.
To have either a flash memory situation.
Or situation where your face looks like.
A completely different color that's so.
Bad and take it from me you will be.
Laughed at by probably a lot of people.
Unfortunately once again it's over to.
The mac video he used one of those tiny.
Drugstore triangular sponges to blend.
Out the entire face and we had to come.
In the last video that it was really.
Really impressive because i felt like it.
Was but then after reading all the.
Comments everyone was like wait this.
Isn't even that impressed that everyone.
Did this do you guys work with the.
Tyrants or liberate those are the only.
Sponges and you had to use those for.
Every makeup application oh my god.
Now we have beauty blenders kabuki.
Brushes and everything in between but i.
Feel like it's impressive now because.
Nobody no one uses them anymore but.
Maybe i'm just crazy definitely know.
What you guys think.
Do you guys use if you do blender or a.
Makeup sponge i feel like at this point.
It's like a necessity but definitely we.
Call it double oh tell me what you apply.
Foundation with because at this point.
I'm just curious.
Next the foundation was all applying and.
By now it was time for concealer and for.
Today he is the tarte save tape couldn't.
Sealer which you guys know as my.
All-time favorite so i was so so excited.
To see him pulling this out and getting.
Ready to use he's always that literally.
Everyone asked for it when they get.
Their makeup done also which is no.
Surprise at all and for today he used to.
Shade a light on me which is the same.
Machine that i use so i was very very.
Excited to see him using this i think it.
Looks as usual perfect on my skin once i.
Face is all.
I used a big fluffy brush and went in.
With the it cosmetics translucent.
Setting powder i've actually never tried.
This one out before so i was very very.
Excited to try out a new product and how.
About on my face and see how at war i.
Felt as though it did a really really.
Good job of mattifying me and keeping my.
Makeup in place and i didn't really get.
A lot of christ's either which is.
Amazing we were definitely stuck in.
Traffic for a pretty long time on the.
Way home today so it definitely did a.
Good job of long-wear he next butted in.
Contour my face and nose using anastacio.
Contour palette asked that the face i.
Have no complaints i feel as though he.
Did a really really great job he put in.
All the right places and didn't put too.
Much on because you guys know that is.
Only big as pet peeves definitely did a.
Really great know of mixing the color as.
Well.
I'm definitely chisel but i'm not to.
Bronze to either so i feel like it was a.
Really really great medium my nose.
Contour he used the same exact contour.
Palette which was fine but he also used.
The same exact brush to contour my nose.
Which i was a little bit spooked about i.
Did tell him that i wanted a very very.
Pinched nose contour to begin with just.
Like i told all the other artists i'm.
Not even kidding guys it's probably like.
This side it's like this is not a nose.
Contouring brush 3 this brush is what i.
Use for my nose contour as you can see.
There's a very very huge difference in.
The sides here and i was very very.
Spewed to anyway and with this you guys.
Know that a good pinch and snot nose.
Contour it's like my favorite element of.
My makeup routine so i was a little bit.
Disappointed in the nose crunchers today.
I feel like it was a little bit messy.
And definitely could've been blended.
More and also was a little bit too wide.
Or however said it he applied the shade.
Of champagne pop from becca which is in.
Collaboration with jacqueline hale i.
Don't think he actually knew who.
Jacqueline hill was so i feel like this.
Is a complete coincidence but obviously.
If you guys know this was a chocolate.
Hey look so i was happy to see him using.
Champagne pop that's for sure and i do.
Love this how the door shaped i was very.
Very excited to see him using it today i.
Do feel like the application is pretty.
Good he did use a really really big.
Brush which once again i was a little.
Bit spooked about i don't know why he.
Did i usually use a very very tiny one.
Like this one the m5 the one from morphe.
But i feel like he bonded out really.
Really well and it doesn't look bad i.
Don't know so highlighter is good next.
Was time for the lashes my artist ashley.
Well style i wanted for this particular.
Look and i showed on the picture of.
Jacqueline again and so that i want.
Something just like these wispy and.
Definitely laughs that get a little bit.
Longer on the ends he brought over four.
Different pairs for me to choose from.
And i ended up picking the are gel.
Studio effect demi wispies before.
Applying the lashes i told you all that.
I have small eyes and always have to cut.
My lashes so they're comfortable to wear.
And he decided to do that today.
The lashes which i very much appreciated.
He glued them on he's in the classic duo.
Lash glue and once they were on their.
Controlled wear and i could not feel.
Them which is it great and then the next.
Step was gonna be of course the ellipse.
While he went to grab washes my artist.
Actually handed me a ben of different.
Liquid lipsticks that i could pick out.
From for today's look so this makeover.
In general i would say was definitely a.
Lot more hands-on than the other ones he.
Was asking me a lot of questions which i.
Definitely appreciated but also asked me.
To pick a lot of things as well which a.
Little bit defeats the point of the.
Video being that i wanted the true.
Artist interpretation but i picked out a.
Lipstick that i thought was pretty close.
So i ended up picking the anasazi liquid.
Lipstick in the shade of trust before we.
Actually went and started the lip.
Application he asked me how i like my.
Lips sean and i did tell him that i like.
Them a little bit overdone on the top.
Lip you guys know that this is a big.
Thing in lastik video where my artist.
Actually underlined them a little bit.
But my lips are a little bit uneven so i.
Really really love over lining them to.
Even them out and make them a little bit.
More plump on the top left but the shape.
Of the lips i really really love how the.
Top lip turned out i feel like he did a.
Really really great and clean tamil.
Overlining the top lip it looked very.
Very nice and very similar to how i.
Would do it and the bottom lip looked.
Pretty nice too although it was a little.
Bit messy on the very very bottom right.
Below like the center arc point i do.
Wish it was a little bit cleaned up but.
It's not that big of a deal and then as.
The color obviously was perfect but then.
Again i picked it not the artist last.
But certainly not least finish i'll just.
Look by spritzing my face using the.
Urban decay all nighter setting spray.
You guys know how to use this all the.
Time and then he even grabbed a palette.
And used that to kind of a fan and help.
It dry which i love by fanning the.
Settings but you're really helping.
Everything amount together and really.
Get a smooth application so that is.
Something alternative techniques alright.
Guys and this is the final look from the.
Alta makeover today look at myself in.
The mirror and thinking about my total.
Experience today at ulta i would rate.
This makeover overall a 7 out of 10 i.
Think my alter artist today definitely.
Used a lot of different products and.
Techniques that i would normally use in.
My own maker patina which i was super.
Super excited about such as too faced.
Born this way foundation and a tarte.
Shave tape but there are a few things on.
The stuff that i don't exactly love.
Being the shape of this crease the lip.
Shape the foundation shade and just.
Overall attention to detail like i said.
The whole point of this series is to.
Have different artists showcase their.
Work and their very own techniques and.
How they differ from my own all right.
