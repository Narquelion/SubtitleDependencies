Hi sisters jean-charles here and welcome.
Back to my youtube channel so today is.
Friday october 26 between halloween is.
Coming up in a few short days and am i.
Excited absolutely have you done.
Anything to prepare no i think i'm.
Literally rsvp'd for 9 halloween parties.
Over the course of the next 4 days and i.
Have a costume for not a single one of.
Them so that's really really good as you.
Can tell i'm doing amazing sweetie work.
Today's video i originally had planned.
On doing a last-minute halloween makeup.
Ideas tutorial video but upon planning.
It out i got very bored considering i.
Feel like there's been a tutorial for.
Every different halloween look at least.
87 million different times and also um i.
Was feeling lazy today i know you how to.
Do at least one halloween makeup just.
Her or else she was literally all kill.
Me so speaking of books that have been.
Done 87 million times today i'm gonna.
Teach you how to be a mermaid now listen.
Hear me out i know you guys have.
Probably seen a million different rings.
Before but it is still one of the most.
Requested looks every single season and.
Apparently i've actually never done them.
Before according to my instagram makeup.
And youtube history which is actually.
It's so crazy.
So if i'm gonna do mermaid you guys know.
I'm gonna go big or go home i am.
Definitely not gonna toss on some teal i.
Said i would call it a day i have a.
Beautiful eye look planned i have some.
Special effects planned and we're just.
Gonna look like i just crawled out of.
The depths of the sea.
Ready to slay halloween season 10.
Without further ado let's get started.
Music.
Hi sisters at james house here and.
Welcome back to my diy okay so before we.
Actually get to the makeup application.
Portion of this mermaid on the face i do.
Have like any kind of scale i do that i.
Want to do on the neck inspired by.
Channing judith you guys may remember.
That name that is our see the artist.
That did my amazing transformation for.
My beauty con series she is so.
Incredibly talented and that is actually.
How i found her or that series was the.
Picture that she posted on twitter of.
Mermaids killed on somebody's leg that.
She did with special effects and i want.
To do my best to recreate the same exact.
Thing on my night today but on a budget.
And make it really really easy for you.
Guys all we're going to need is two.
Things a hot glue gun i got this other.
Castro for a whopping 11 dollars glue.
Stick got these for three dollars now.
These are fun glue sticks because.
They're glittery can you see that great.
I thought these would be really easy for.
The marina boat since i have green.
Sparkle in them and we're gonna add a.
Green sparkle on top anyway so saving.
Ourselves some time if you're under the.
Age of 13 don't do this unless you have.
A parents help i don't want to get sued.
For one of you burning yourselves with a.
Clue so this has been a ps i thank you.
For coming to my talk i can't find.
Parchment paper most because i forgot to.
Buy it so what we're gonna do is take.
This classic green sheet and hope that i.
Don't burn it and stick at the glue.
Stick in the glue gun.
Basically what i'm gonna do is take the.
Glue stack and take this sheet and i'm.
Going to just squeeze it real good and.
Just put a dollop of glue on there and.
Kind of the shape of a mermaid scale.
Kind of just like that and i'm gonna.
Give the gun a good twirl to get that.
Straight off and then sit there first.
Like that because in case you didn't.
Know hot glue is very hot once again.
Thank you this is what a fuse bag so.
Once this is how to second to cool down.
I'm gonna take my clean finger and i'm.
Going to lately press on the glue and.
Flatten out a little bit right before it.
Fully hardens and you'll notice that the.
Glue is slightly moldable so you can.
Kind of form it into the shape of a.
Scale to say thoughts kind of like round.
And flat like that is literally it so.
We're just gonna make like a lot of them.
Music.
So once you have like a lot done final.
Here to do is describe a pair of it.
Really sharp tweezers i'm gonna use this.
Music.
Oh this is not playing well.
Oh my god the next thing this dope turns.
Out my face is gonna burn down am i.
Crazy.
You saw that oh it's right here oh no so.
As always i always like to start off my.
Foundation at first i'm gonna grab my.
Too faced born this way foundation if.
This photos in the shade natural beige.
And i'm gonna tell you right now the.
Shade is far tanner than i am we're.
Going for a mermaid look okay we're.
Gonna be tan and i'm also gonna grab a.
Little bit of the mac strobe cream and.
Gold light as well.
I know desi perkins actually just.
Uploaded a mermaid tutorial and her look.
Was so incredibly beautiful and inspired.
Me to do a little bit more of a glowy.
Look for today just gonna grab my beauty.
Sponge and mix that together on the back.
Of my hand and then just plop it right.
On there and blend it.
And then with the access foundation on.
The back of my hand i'm just gonna take.
9 and i'm going to really dip.
Into that and blend down my neck one to.
Avoid getting a million comments saying.
That my foundation doesn't match because.
I know and two because you guys just saw.
Me making those skills earlier and those.
Are going to be going on my neck later.
On in the video so i definitely need.
Everything to blend together seamlessly.
Next i'm just gonna grab a concealer.
This is the attar shave tape as always.
And apply this to the high points of my.
Face to cover up my under eye bags and.
Also just to add some more dimension.
Just because i really like how the.
Attention goes right down to the center.
And just really makes everything look.
Super pretty from products that i'm.
Actually gonna use two different ones.
The first one begin the regular laura.
Mercier translucent setting powder this.
Is so my all-time favorites and also the.
Brand-new laura mercier glow translucent.
Powder i haven't really tried this.
Without yet but i do all my stay to be.
Very very dewy today so first.
Impressions time i'm gonna dip my beauty.
Blender into the regular powder and use.
This to set right underneath my eyeballs.
Just because i really need to set this.
In place and also just right on top of.
The dinos bridge as well in the center.
Of the forehead just to get those.
Creases gone to contour today i was.
Gonna go buy a before oh fire brush usko.
J's for 10% off and dip into my.
Anastacio contouring a kit and just dip.
Into this middle cool tone shade right.
Open here i do already normally tend to.
Go a little bit harsh with the contour.
Just because i really like the way my.
Face looks when it's really tough.
Loadout.
But for today i do actually want to go.
Even a little bit harsher than normal.
Especially with the bronzer because this.
Is obviously a mermaid sunkissed kind of.
Type of look and the next undergo am.
About five to seven brushes is just a.
Beefy big a bronzer brush and dip into.
This kind of more a caramel shade or.
Right next door to that one and i'm.
Gonna use this to blend together my.
Contour and normal skin tones i'm gonna.
Save the blush and highlight for a.
Little bit later on i'm mostly because.
I'm not exactly sure what combination.
I'm gonna be feeling when it comes to.
The eye look so for right now what i am.
Going to do is it for once not baked.
Because i definitely don't want to look.
At any more powder than i are do i.
Really want that dewy look so i'm going.
To grab my mac fix+ of gold light as you.
Can see this bottle has definitely had.
Quite the usage this is like one of my.
Favorite makeup products.
Early in the entire world it is just so.
Pretty and it is just like fix+ butter.
Does have a slight glitter in it that.
Just reflects so nicely on the skin i'm.
Gonna get myself a quick sister spreads.
I'm gonna do a rose quickly using the.
Anasazi eyebrow was in the shade and.
Medium brown air pencil all time and i'm.
Gonna do these a little bit more like.
Fluffy and a wispy than normal i.
Definitely don't want them to be like.
Normal james charles instagram brow i.
Want a little bit more of like a.
Underwater wet moment does that make.
Sense.
You'll see okay sorry line i literally.
Filled them in exactly and like i'd.
Normally do but and then it's gonna grab.
The anasazi clear gel after that and i'm.
Going to go right through and kind of.
Brush those hairs upwards to kind of get.
Rid of a little bit of that brow pencil.
To really make them a little bit more.
Light and fluffy and just to make them.
Look spiky by seljuk at brow hello i.
Kind of like low-key don't even want to.
Conceal under neath my eyebrows but i.
Also feel like i need to it's cleaner.
Really really lightly go right.
Underneath that brow not even really to.
Clean it up just to literally cover over.
The foundations i'm just gonna pull that.
Concealer right down onto the eyelid to.
Prime for eyeshadow so that is the face.
All done and now i get to move on to my.
All-time favorite part always which is.
Going to be the eyes and for its today's.
Like i actually have a really fun look.
Picked out from an artist that i fall on.
Instagram her name is gabrielle with two.
Axes and is this like neon green to dark.
Blue kind of cut crease with the glitter.
Liner look that she has going on it is.
So crazy so intense but it's like it's.
Going to look absolutely perfect with.
This mermaid lips today and we're gonna.
Attempt hopefully hate to make this look.
Good so i'm first gonna start off with.
13.
And just dip into a neon bright green.
Shade and i'm gonna pop this right in at.
The inner corner right here just.
Starting by topping it in so it's super.
Super pigmented.
And then i'm just going to lightly blend.
Out those edges to make sure those edges.
Have blended out on an m4 33 i'm just.
Gonna dip into a bright yellow shade and.
A tiny bit of that green as well and.
Just go right over the edge.
That's too yellow i'm just kidding going.
Back into the green on another i'm 433.
I'm gonna dupe into a light teal shade.
And place that right next door.
Focusing this color right above my.
Natural crease with any excess i'm just.
Going to lightly blend this up going.
Back into that green take sure we didn't.
Lose any of it with the same exact brush.
On the teal i'm going to dip into more.
Of that tail shade and i'm going to use.
This color to form that outer v starting.
Off by just kind of stamping that shade.
On there and then of course going in.
After to blend it out and my outer.
Corner i'm just gonna take a little bit.
More of a fluffy packing brush and dip.
Into a darker blue i don't know places.
Right in the outer v and just pack it on.
There and i'm just putting that shade.
Right up into the crease.
Okay sorry hello i am back the camera.
Just accidentally stopped recording it.
Has only been over a year since i filmed.
This tutorial so sorry about that.
Once this shadow was all planned out the.
Way i liked it i'm just gonna go ahead.
And cut my crease using a a small.
Concealer brush and some shave tape on.
The back of my hand this is gonna have.
So far i'm gonna grab a small pocket.
Brushes the a matte one to four and just.
Pack on a light teal shade i mean like.
Hello right on the inner corner just.
Packing the shade on there right on top.
Of the concealer being super careful not.
To get it over the line it's okay if the.
Shade doesn't purposely touch that cut.
Crease as well because they had to be.
Using a liquid liner in a few short.
Minutes just to line out the crease and.
Then without saving that brush i'm just.
Gonna dip into more of a that metallic.
Like aqua shade literally oops i had.
Literally don't know how to do tutorials.
And i'm just gonna place that right or.
That kind of line between it the light.
Teal and dark blue just to blend them.
Together i'm just kind of patting it on.
There and then using a slight like.
Back-and-forth rubbing motion to blend.
At the same time so for the inner corner.
Little liner i actually don't have like.
A sky blue liquid liner so what i am.
Going to do is use this white liner from.
I don't even know what brendan says my.
Friend hey-zeus gave me this one but.
This brand it's just a really good white.
Liner mixed with literally the tiniest.
Bit of the ofra liquid lipstick in the.
Shade on my beach now i think i'm going.
To use the yellow liner i'm going to.
Follow that line and wing it out just.
Like that oh my god pretty okay and then.
Once that later is dry i'm just gonna.
Grab the urban decay glitter liner in.
The shade a midnight cowboy and go right.
Over top of that yellow so i think for.
The liner i'm once again gonna grab a.
Little bit more concealer on the back of.
My hand and yet another tiny brush this.
One is the morphe at 19 and i'm going to.
Cut the lid kind of like again i guess.
But like only in the liner area using a.
Really tiny pocket brush i'm just gonna.
Tap on that metallic teal shade from.
Before right onto that concealer carving.
A little bit of the peaches and cream.
And glitter makeup base on the e30 7.
Brushes just a tiny little brush and.
Just packing that right on top of the.
Liner ivor's gonna pack on a gold.
Pigment right on the inner corner then.
Just placing got some chunkier glitter.
That i found at the craft store right in.
The center just gonna go the urban decay.
Midnight cowboy liner one last high and.
Pop it over top of that inner corner so.
That is the upper eyelid all complete.
And i'm actually really happy how that.
Turned out.
Didn't really have too much confidence.
Myself not gonna lie but kind of looking.
Good and fresh so i'm gonna finish out.
The eye now using the amp or three three.
And first dip into that same aqua shade.
From before and start placing this on at.
The lower lash line making sure to.
Connect to in from that outer v region.
And then go in the deep blue shade on em.
506 and just tucking that right up into.
The outer corner and pumping it up into.
The lash line as well any time use a.
Little bit of green or right in that.
Inner corner i'm gonna use the tarte.
Press payment in the shade at top yacht.
To highlight my brow bone and inner.
Corner to finish off the light in my.
Waterline i'm gonna put the tarte.
Claypot in the shade of blue moon right.
Up in there and then four locks i'm.
Gonna pop on a pair of yas queen from.
Lily lashes these are brand new and they.
Are literally miami's except one time as.
Long as.
The other this is everything that i've.
Ever needed in a lodge all right sisters.
And that is one i of this mermaid look.
All complete i'm gonna go in and if they.
Want off camera quickly they save some.
Time because that literally just took me.
An hour half i'll be right back to.
Finish out the rest of this hug we're.
Back it's been another hour but i am.
Still going strong kind of those lea's.
All complete and low-key like hello i.
Snap like this looks so pretty i.
Absolutely i'm obsessed of how this.
Turned out thank you so much to.
Gabrielle for the inspiration at today.
But let's move on to it the rest of the.
Face to finish up this mermaid look so.
To put on my blush and highlight and.
Like everything else today i wanted to.
Grab a pair of a fishnet tights because.
That creates a whole like scale effect.
And i forgot to buy them so instead i.
Have to use my very very expensive at.
Swarovski crystal tights that i wore to.
Drakon i'm very annoyed about this and.
I'm going to try not to ruin them a.
Little bit on us that literally barely.
Did anything you're kidding you can see.
It but like that is not okay so this.
Gift obviously did not work but it's.
Okay because we're gonna have scales on.
Our neck later on light hopin it spot i.
Do want to add something to my face so i.
Picked out these half little pearls that.
I want to stick on kind of fun oh my god.
Doing things those nails are so hard.
I put one right up in here and one right.
On that one too okay so that is pretty.
Much the face all complete i think i'm.
Going to add on the anasazi beverly.
Hills liquid lipstick in the shade.
Insomniac as a base and i'm gonna pop on.
A little bit of the mac reflex in the.
Shaded teal right on the center all.
Right you guys see that it already.
Sensors i'm just gonna finish this off.
Once again with a little bit of the.
Mac's fix+.
Gold setting spray and that is pretty.
Much this look all complete so you could.
Totally stop here throw in a wig some.
Seashells a cute little bra and a.
Mermaid tail and call it today but this.
Is the james charles youtube channel and.
You guys don't really take it a step.
Further so i want to add some special.
Effects to the mix i'm first gonna start.
By over my makeup forever flash palette.
You can use this or like literally any.
Face paint it does not matter okay.
Totally what i'm actually gonna start by.
Doing is scraping my liquid latex from.
Ben nye and a roll of toilet paper now.
Special effects is very very complicated.
But i'm a beginner and i do definitely.
Want to learn more there may or may not.
Be a video on that coming very very soon.
But for now this is all you're gonna.
Need i'm gonna pour a little bit of it.
Out into this little hole in my lash.
Thing just for easy access and then just.
Using a disposable cross buns i'm just.
Going to start by applying this to my.
Neck i'm gonna focus in on little areas.
At a time as well because it does dry it.
Pretty quickly.
So literally that's all i need then i'm.
Gonna grab just a sheet of toilet paper.
I'm going to shred it up into little.
Pieces and i'm gonna lay it right on the.
Skin and then once i does on that i'm.
Just gonna go back in with a little bit.
More on the brush basically what we're.
Doing here is creating like a second.
Layer of skin over top of the area that.
I want to have the scales on so once the.
Latex is completely dry i can actually.
Peel up a hole in the middle and it'll.
Look like my skin is like ripping there.
Are a lot of different ways you can.
Actually achieve this look as well i.
Think channing and her original photo.
Used.
Scar wax which i do have it right here.
You can like mold this kind of like clay.
On the skin but it's definitely a lot.
More work and it's for people who really.
Know what they're doing and.
That's not me.
Well unsexy she's all on there i'm just.
Gonna take another bag a glob of liquid.
Latex on the spine and i'm just gonna go.
Lightly over the entire surface just.
Kind of brush it to make it smooth and.
Then with that access product i'm just.
Gonna go around and really really.
Lightly and kind of feather the look of.
Latex now on the edges obviously it is.
Going to try obviously we're gonna put.
Foundation over it to fix the color but.
We want the actual formula and the.
Texture to blend with the skin as much.
As possible.
I'm just gonna let this dry down for a.
Few minutes i'll be right back what does.
Pretty much fine i'm just gonna grab a.
Fluffy brush and some translucent powder.
And just tap that right on the surface.
Just to make sure everything is in place.
And nothing is still wet by accident.
And if you're doing this at home as well.
Your neck should feel really really.
Tight right now that's okay it's a good.
Thing then i'm just gonna grab once.
Again at my too faced born this way.
9 and i'm.
Just going to stipple that and then just.
Going to powder that once again okay so.
Now comes the fun part where this stops.
Looking like a gross scary rash and.
Starts looking like mermaid scales so.
I'm just gonna grab my tiny little.
Scissors that i use with my lashes now.
Be careful during this time please do.
Not cut yourself but i'm just going to.
Lightly go in and start picking at the.
Center of the latex now once you're in.
You should be able to start cutting so.
Crazy okay and you're basically just.
Gonna cut out a big hole right around.
This entire area and then once you have.
That oval i'm just gonna cut little slit.
Into the edges to kind of like ruffle.
Them off a little bit.
You.
Kind of lightly tug on it as well now.
I'm going to grab my m2 g4 brush and my.
Make up forever flash palette and i'm.
Gonna dip into the teal blue and green.
Shades and it's kind of mixed them all.
Together and plopped them right in there.
Then it's gonna grab a little bit of.
Block kind of a lot a bit of block.
Honestly i don't it's going to use this.
And shove it right in the outer edges.
Just to create some more dimension and.
To make it look like it's an actual hole.
Music.
So finally now we get to all the hot.
Glue scales we literally spent two hours.
Making today half of which are now.
Missing inside of my stove can't wait to.
Burn my house down to apply this i'm.
Just gonna grab some kryolan at spiricom.
As you can see mine has clearly been.
Through quite a lot at this point still.
Works just as well basically this is.
Just kind of like insanely strong glue.
And all you do is put it right on the.
Area it's gonna wait for it to dry a.
Little bit and then stick on some sister.
Scales.
Music.
You.
You guys about liquid latex on them like.
Without do anything once that is all dry.
And set in place thank god.
I guess the answer is to use liquid.
Latex and not spiricom we're learning.
Together now i went to gravel once again.
That same little brush and just too big.
Into the makeup rover flash palette i'm.
Just going to grab a mixture of those.
Colors and we're going to stipple them.
Over top of the skills just to bring.
Some of that color back since the tan is.
Clearly not what we're looking for a.
Little bit of reflex teal right up in.
There i should put some little glitters.
In there too just for funsies oh katie.
Already sisters and that is this under.
The sea a mermaid look all complete yeah.
I did for this look came very very last.
Second and i have not done a tutorial in.
A very very long time i definitely.
Apologize if the city was a little bit.
Of a mess but then again so is every.
Single james charles video and in the.
