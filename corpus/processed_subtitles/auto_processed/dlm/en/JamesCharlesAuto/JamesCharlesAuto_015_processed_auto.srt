Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back my youtube channel first.
Today's video i am very very excited.
Because we're doing something a little.
Bit different for me at least obviously.
You guys know i don't really do reviews.
That often on this youtube channel i'm.
Definitely a person that six are the.
Same makeup products in every single.
Video i mean if it ain't broke don't fix.
It every once in a while i make our.
Brand and the industry will come with a.
Product that is very very exciting that.
Everyone cannot stop talking about and.
That is what happened today because of.
My favorite brands of all time anasazi.
At beverly hills just launched their.
Brand new at foundation and they're.
Setting powder duo that get effect.
That's a little scary.
3 james is who kimberly have a bill on.
Let's be real okay and it's no secret.
That for me foundation is a little bit.
Of a sore subject when it comes to a.
Makeup routine like we've had some great.
Moments we've also had some really.
Really awful embarrassing moments i'm.
Not afraid to admit that i'm definitely.
Not a foundation export in any way shape.
Or form i struggle quite a lot with it.
Honestly but at this point i have tried.
Quite a lot of different foundations to.
Modify like my perfect foundation that.
Works for me so whenever a new.
Foundation comes out that i'm excited.
About.
I definitely always want to try it out.
And for today's video that is exactly.
What we're going to do auto sauce they.
Sent over their entire shade range of.
The foundations and their loose powders.
And we're gonna test it out i have some.
At meetings i have some phone calls and.
I also have a photo shoot today so we're.
Doing a full we're test giving you guys.
The healthy i'm brand new bodice asya.
Beverly hills foundation.
Music.
All right you guys let's just jump right.
Into this review i'm so excited if.
Everything that i have to do today.
Actually this will be really good at.
Where test as well because it will be.
Wearing it all day long and also through.
A photo shoot so we'll get to see how it.
Really photographs in front of super.
High definition cameras which could be.
Very very scary or it could look really.
Really bomb anasazi sent over these pr.
Packages super early this morning and if.
You open it up here's what's inside if i.
Pull one of the shades out of the pr box.
This is actually what the packaging.
Component looks like it is just a super.
Simple glass rectangular bottle which i.
Really really like i'm says anasazi.
Beverly hills luminous foundation on.
This side and on the other side it says.
Foundation and really huge black letters.
And when i first saw this i'm not gonna.
Lie if something did it like it it's.
Just something that i'm definitely never.
Seen before and when i thought at first.
I was a little bit taken aback but i do.
Follow more vita on twitter who is the.
President of anastacio and as somebody.
Asked her about it and she said that.
It's actually for a makeup artist.
Because when you pack everything in a.
Kit it can be really really hard to kind.
Of distinguish everything so if it's.
Labeled you know exactly what you're.
Grabbing for you kind of think that.
That's located very very smart and.
Straight to the point now in each bottle.
I believe there is yep one fluid ounce.
Of product which is definitely the.
Universal standard when it comes to at.
Foundations at this point and this will.
Be retailing for $38 which i think is.
Also like kind of the standard - i think.
The 21 is $35 the two days for this way.
That i always use is 38 i think the.
Urban decay one is 40 of all those.
Prices are right in my head for some.
Reason so it definitely is like an.
Average price point in terms of the.
Other foundations of the top-tier brands.
Now in terms of shade into this.
Foundation that there are five different.
Categories fair light medium tan and.
Deep and they come in a 50 different.
Shades which i think is so what's so.
Beyond incredible there's not a single.
Skip or gap in between there's a nice.
Beautiful ombre from super super pale to.
Super super dark and everybody i'm sure.
I can find a shade somewhere in here.
Hopefully we include it because you guys.
Know that i struggled quite a lot but i.
Think this is really really important so.
Many brands heard about the makeup.
Industry or coming out with that.
Foundation lines with like i super pale.
White color and then a dark brown and.
Are like oh my god we're inclusive what.
Do you do but in reality there's like 12.
Shades and.
Undertones are all off all inclusivity.
Means that literally anybody can go to.
The line and anybody can find their.
Color and i think that it's very very.
Important i'm not gonna swatch all 50.
Shades because i don't think that's.
Showcasing the deeper skin tones on my.
Skin tone is gonna help literally.
Anybody purchasing it duh but i do want.
To give some quick love to nima tang and.
Alissa ashley they have some of my.
Favorite foundation reviews for women of.
Color and also make up tiffany j just.
Because i freaking love her and i've.
Been obsessed watching her videos.
Recently if you guys want to check out.
Their videos on this foundation i'm sure.
They'll be up very very soon i wanna.
Quickly go over the claims before we.
Actually put the foundation on the.
Anasazi beverly hills luminous.
Foundation is water-resistant long.
Wearing with a medium coverage formula.
Okay it gives the complexion a fresh.
Already a lot with a lightweight second.
Skin feeling it is a no flashback.
Formula we will definitely be testing.
That with our photo shoot later on today.
It is suitable for all skin types.
Including sensitive skin which you know.
Is very very important for a lot of your.
Sisters out there it is clinically.
Tested dermatologist tested and the.
Formula is also cruelty free and vegan.
Lastly before we actually get into our.
Makeup application i know this intro is.
Very very long at associate also.
Launched their brand new setting powders.
As well which i'm a very very powerful.
And will be using in this video it comes.
In at 5 at different change which i.
Think is actually really really cool we.
Have the shade of vanilla for light skin.
Tones we have banana for medium skin.
Tones we have deep peach for tan skin.
Tones we have golden orange or deep skin.
Tones.
That we also have a translucent which is.
The universal shade for everybody.
Wow that's some good balancing right.
There look at the on associate setting.
Powder is a lightweight silky powder.
That sets makeup with a flawless matte.
Finish so hopefully there will be no.
Shine fingers crossed it delivers a long.
Wearing of that to the makeup okay we.
Will test that today and see hopefully.
It wants to do many touch-ups.
It has clinically tested and also.
Cruelty-free and vegan and this setting.
Powder will retail for $36 which is just.
Like dee foundation is very like average.
Pricing oh my god okay the intro is.
Finally done.
This is why i don't do reviews okay that.
Was like three hours of me just talking.
And stuttering and trying to say the.
Same thing over no too much information.
This is why i just like to put on the.
Makeup and call it a day but i'm so.
Excited to actually get into this in.
China but now we have another challenge.
But if we actually get into our makeup.
And that is color.
This should be interesting.
Okay so we have the two hundredths which.
Definite looks like it could be bad for.
Me we had the three hundredths which is.
Too dark i feel like definitely we have.
The 100's which i feel like are two.
Lights we have the five hundreds which.
Are definitely not right i'm gonna go.
Ahead and test some of the trades in the.
Light category we have 160 200 210 220.
And 240 and see if any of them are a.
Good match for me let's try it 160 on my.
Hand it looks a little bit light on my.
Face it looks a little bit light on my.
Chest it looks a little bit too yellow.
Let's try 200 w now my hand also looks.
Way too light on my face it looks too.
Light and on my chest it looks not great.
Let's try 2 10 neutral under told us a.
Little bit better but it still looks a.
Little bit too light on my hand on my.
Face it looks not anywhere close to.
Anything on my chest the undertone looks.
Definitely better but still no let's try.
220 neutral let's go a little bit darker.
Honestly yeah okay let's try 250 oh wow.
That like blends in with my neck so well.
Kind of ish maybe not.
I mixed together 250 and 220 let's see.
How this looks that looks really good.
That undertone looks really good yeah.
Okay we're going with that one okay out.
Of all the things that we try it i think.
I'm actually going to end up going with.
315 and neutral which is a lot darker.
Than i thought it would be but as you.
Can see this color matches my hand.
Almost like exactly and once i blend and.
Weigh down on my neck it's gonna match.
Touch my body - like i said this process.
Is very very irritating and frustrating.
For me to deal with but you gotta do it.
You gotta do i'm gonna stuff with just.
My touch out water cream to moisturize.
My face before i go ahead and put on the.
Foundation and then describing a tiny.
Little bit of the dragon beauty color.
Corrector just to cover over some beard.
Areas just like i normally do finally.
Let's go ahead and put this on i'm going.
To spot my face in half and do a beauty.
Blender on one side and a brush on the.
Other.
Both of these are from morphe which you.
Guys can use ko james for 10% off and.
Will see it which one it looks better.
Well that actually looks like a really.
Good color the foundation claims to be.
Lightweight and medium coverage which i.
Will say it is building up really really.
Nicely and it is covering over the color.
Corrector which is obviously important.
Because we don't want orange.
Shining through the points just to.
Cancel out those gray tones you.
Definitely can still see my freckles and.
A beauty marks to the foundation which i.
Really really do like but it is doing a.
Great job with evening everything out.
Which is obviously the point of a medium.
Coverage okay it's definitely feeling.
Really really nice on the skin it does.
Not feel super heavy it just like it.
Cleaned which is obviously it really.
Really good and i feel like it did a.
Good job of evening everything out.
Covering everything it looks really.
Really bob okay let's go ahead and try.
Out the brush on the other side i've.
Honestly always just been so confused.
And also jealous of people who are able.
To use a foundation brush and like do.
Their foundation no matter how much i.
Blend it out i always feel like i need a.
Beauty blender to go and just like make.
Everything look like perfect and get rid.
Of brush strokes like is that just me.
Like am i literally crazy i'm definitely.
A beauty blender type of person no we.
Just have to blown this down really.
Really far in here okay you guys so this.
Is how the audition looks on the scan at.
With a beauty blender on one side and a.
Foundation brush on the other oh wow.
Okay we are close up and ready to go how.
It looks really really pretty it.
Definitely is luminous just like it.
Claims but it doesn't look like gross.
Oily i definitely will be setting this.
Down with a powder and a few minutes but.
This is off to a really really good.
Start i definitely do agree that it is.
Medium coverage even everything got.
Really nicely but you can still see my.
Freckles popping through there is this.
Pimple popping through which is annoying.
Me but i wonder if i add just a little.
Bit more if it like buildup oh yeah it.
Does okay so it is definitely buildable.
This is good advice let's do a.
Concealer quickly for concealer that's.
Always i'm just gonna grab my shape tape.
And highlight the middle points of my.
Face.
All right you because that is everything.
All blended out the concealer layer over.
Top of everything are really really.
Nicely at nothing weird at all and the.
Foundation is looking at so what's so.
Beautiful at this point but i do want to.
Go ahead and set it and please so we're.
Gonna test out the brand-new anastasio.
Setting powders as well i'm gonna.
Prescribe this shade at vanilla because.
These can be used for brighten a i don't.
Know why that i love how big these jars.
Are it feels very luxurious i'm just.
Gonna dip in my beauty sponge into that.
Powder and pop this right underneath the.
Eye to do some nice bright at night.
Wondering how brightening this actually.
Is that could've been a mistake could.
Also put this right in the middle of my.
Forehead.
Has not to always work its most whaley.
Well that modified things really quickly.
What chrissy was kind of like in the.
Center of my face then it's gonna grab.
The translucent shade and with a fluffy.
Brush that's gonna dip into this and.
He's just too sad do you rest of my face.
In place okay so they were not kidding.
When they said that it would be very mad.
Wow i'm just gonna get myself a quick.
Spritz of the anastacio doing setting.
Spray just because this is the luminess.
Of foundation and if i assume you guys n.
This is what the foundation is looking.
Like now that is all set in place it is.
Setting on the scanner so nicely there's.
No creasing at no fine lines no texture.
This is good okay you guys so this is.
Pretty much the base routine all.
Complete and i will say right now i'm.
Really really liking how it looks but i.
Have a full face of makeup now to add on.
To this but for my photo shoot which i'm.
Not running very very late for so i'm.
Going to go into that off camera quickly.
I will check in with the finished look.
And about an hour for now and then we.
Will continue checking in throughout the.
Day to see if it continues to look.
Really really good or this could turn.
Into a major fail later on we're going.
To find out together.
All right you guys of your gawk and this.
Is the finished look all complete this.
Is not a special look it is for the.
Photo shoot like i said obviously we're.
Focusing on the foundation and as of.
Right now i think it looks so what's so.
30 oh you.
Can't even see it it is currently 231.
P.m. you're gonna have to trust me on.
This one i started this video about two.
Hours ago now but i did have to take.
About a 30 minute break for a phone call.
Meeting and through talking through the.
Entire thing i did not get any creases.
The foundation still looks really really.
Beautiful i am getting a little bit of.
Shine right here in this area which i.
Don't love but it is a luminous.
Foundation which is a little bit.
Different for me so i'm going to go into.
This open-minded and just hope that it.
Doesn't get really really bad later on.
If it stays like this i'll be super.
Super happy okay guys and here's how it.
Looks in it natural lighting - honestly.
You guys i think it looks.
So it's so good i don't know jinx that.
Comes me believe it but a little how.
About but it looks so bob and the color.
Like guys let them out this is rare how.
Would you say my foundations looking so.
Far i'm doing a little review today okay.
It looks really good it looks like a.
Good match okay so about four hours and.
Right now this is pretty good for four.
Hours yeah great.
42 p.m. we just.
Finished our photo shoot and i was super.
Hungry because they realize i forgot to.
Eat today don't do that kids it's not.
Good for you i thought i'd be really.
Keen to just like take some photos with.
My mcflurry and my french fries but i.
Wanted to do a quick little check in.
Because as i was looking through the.
Photos of her a little at mcdonald's.
Parking lot photo shoot that we have.
Going on right now the first thing that.
I noticed was my skin was looking really.
Really good and i'm very excited about.
That the foundation has been on for.
About seven hours by now it was also.
Okay about 105 degrees in california.
Today which was absolutely disgusting.
I was literally sweating and deimos.
During my photo shoot tmi start you.
Didn't know that but you do because it's.
A foundation review i didn't do any.
Touch-ups but i did have to like blow.
Myself a tiny little bit with the napkin.
Earlier it's really hard being instagram.
Model you but point being it still looks.
Really bomb we are seven hours in at the.
Foundation wear test it's going pretty.
Well.
If i look in the mirror i'm not really.
Seeing any creases aside from just this.
One in at my mouth region but i get that.
All the time.
My nose region is getting a little bit.
Oily if this happens literally every.
Foundation that i've ever worn it but.
It's not bad so i really happy what do.
You guys think you can't answer that.
Joke then you put over in the comments.
Peter on let's get out of here this is a.
Vas.
Oh like hell are you kidding all right.
Sisters we are finally back home after a.
Very very long a but super super.
Productive day i cannot wait for you.
Guys to see what we've been working on.
It is currently 1108 p.m. at night that.
Is how p.m. maids oh my god.
I am beyond exhausted and this makeup.
Has been on for 11 hours now and it's.
Time to give you guys my final thoughts.
I am pretty sure you guys can guess one.
Thing about this foundation since i.
Definitely have made it really obvious.
To all the check-ins today but i do want.
To give you guys just a quick little.
Sister summary my skin definitely is.
Getting pretty oily in a few different.
Places it specifically at my nose region.
Right here on like my under eye cheek.
Type of region and then kind of above.
The brow bone in the center of the.
Forehead this is pretty typical for my.
Skin no matter what foundation they're.
Wearing especially if i don't do stop.
Shops throughout the day which i.
Normally do obviously for this review i.
Did not so i could give you guys the.
Unfiltered result but concerned this is.
A luminous foundation i really don't.
Think it looks bad at all i think this.
Is exactly what the foundation claimed.
To do and if i'm being honest i don't.
Even think the oiliness looks not bad.
Personally i would definitely take a.
Little bit of powder and touch up this.
Face but i know a lot of people do.
Prefer a more dewy.
Natural skin like type of finish so for.
Those of you guys i think this.
Foundation will be absolutely perfect.
And this is definitely thing that i'll.
Be adding to my kit and using a lot more.
Often all right you guys that i think.
That is pretty much everything that i.
Have for today is a brand new video i'm.
Trying to make sure that i didn't forget.
Anything but i think we're pretty much.
All good if you enjoyed it please don't.
