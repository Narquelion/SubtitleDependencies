It has also been so much fun to put out.
So much condit for you guys that i'm.
Honestly really really loving it well i.

Fun well it's lasting if you guys and i.

Probably somewhere over there i'm not.
Really sure check out the channel.
Welcome to the sisterhood sick everybody.
I'm not ready for today's video i am so.
So pumped because today is the finale of.
My little mini makeover series as you.
Guys know i am a beauty guru and it is.
My job to do my own makeup almost every.
Single day but i rarely ever get my.
Makeup done by other artists last week i.
Started a super fun at makeover series.
On my channel where i went to sephora.
Mac and ulta and got my makeup done at.
All three locations i asked for this.
Picture right here of jaclyn hill i'm.
Not gonna forget it this time and each.
Time came up with a very very different.
Result getting these mini glam makeovers.
And showing you guys the results was.
Honestly so much fun and so cool to see.
All the different artists different.
Styles and techniques that they use on.
Me i honestly learned so so much but so.
Many of you guys were saying that for.
The finale you guys wanted to see me do.
The look on myself and do how i would.
Normally do the same exact look so for.
Today's video that is exactly what we're.
Doing i'm gonna be recreating that same.
Exact look from jaclyn hill on myself.
Are gonna be talking about all three.
Makeovers and my own makeover we're.
Gonna be comparing them all talking.
About the prices talking about the.
Products talking about the truth tea.
Whatsoever i recommend you guys to go to.
If you have a very special event so.
Without further ado let's go ahead and.
Get glam for one last time for this mini.
Makeover series grand finale.
Music.
For my first step of my makeup routine.
Today i'm gonna grab the top out water.
Cream which is my all-time favorite.
Moisturizer i absolutely love using.
Moisturizer before my foundation and i.
Think a really really good skin care.
Routine is absolutely vital to a really.
Successful makeup routine and the places.
That did that were ulta and sephora.
Before my makeover so major props to.
Them for that one side face is already a.
Nice and moisturized.
Of course my next step is going to be a.
Foundation and for today's economies in.
The make up for ever ultra hd stick and.
I am in the shade y2 45 right now the.
Makeup forever stick is definitely my.
All-time pure foundations if you guys.
Been subscribed me for a while you know.
That i've been using it for a very very.
Long time just as a reminder when i went.
To sephora the artists use the bare.
Minerals foundation on me when i went to.
Macrame artists used of course the mac.
Studio fix fluid and when i went to ulta.
They used born this way and born swings.
Actually one of my all-time favorites as.
Well but the color was not exactly the.
Best match you guys know that i.
Definitely live a very very full.
Coverage type of base even when i do my.
More light natural looks i still like a.
Very very full coverage foundation.
Because i do have pretty uneven skin.
Naturally and as well in the picture.
That jacqueline posted she is definitely.
Full beat glam there's no questions.
About it so i feel like we definitely.
Needed a very very full coverage.
Foundation to match this look today for.
Consider today of course i'm going to.
Using my heart shape tube concealer you.
Guys don't this is my all-time favorite.
And i'm in the shade light sand i'm just.
Gonna apply this underneath my eyes on.
The sides of my nose for the snatch look.
When it comes to contouring and all the.
High points of my face just to add a lot.
Of dimension and my sephora makeover my.
Artists use the nars radiant creamy.
Concealer and imac makeover my artists.
Use the new mac pro longwear concealer.
And it might also make over my artist.
Use that arch shape tape just like i'm.
Using right now so honestly we had a.
Really really good selection of.
Concealers in all the different places.
That we went to then i'm gonna pond this.
In it very very well using a damp beauty.
Blender unfortunately we have no.
Triangular makeup sponges today mac's.
Gonna take my damp beauty blender and.
Dip it into my laura mercier translucent.
Setting powder and just use this to set.
My entire face and like my foundation in.
Place and my sephora makeover my artists.
Use this powder which as you guys know.
Is my all-time favorite have i mac.
Makeovers to use the mac translucent.
Setting powder which spoiler alert i.
Absolutely hated that a my ulta makeover.
He used the it cosmetics trust as a.
Setting powder which i literally did not.
Even know it.
Said.but worked fine next to come onto.
My face today i'm gonna grab my kat von.
D shade and light palette a breeze my.
Morphe m14 one brush and dip into it the.
Last shade and that's tiny bit into the.
Middle shade and use this to it chisel.
Out my cheekbones in the photo that.
Jacqueline posted she definitely had a.
Very very light and soft contour which.
Honestly is not really my cup of tea you.
Guys know that i love a good snatched.
Cheekbone a very very chiseled jawline.
And definitely a contoured and lowered.
Forehead that is for sure.
But obviously we're doing our best to.
Recreate the photos today so i'm gonna.
Go very very light on the contour powder.
And make sure not to go too too crazy.
And i support make over my artist use.
The hourglass ambient lighting bronzer.
To contour my face which i thought was a.
Little bit weird first of all i didn't.
Know it existed which obviously means.
Nothing but i felt as though it was a.
Little bit of a shimmery product which.
Is kind of weird for bronzer it.
Definitely was more of like a bronze or.
Harlot combo rather than a contour so i.
Do wish it was a little bit more chilled.
Out and a more cool toned softer type of.
Situation and mac my artist actually.
Used the mac of blotting powders in the.
Darkest shade which i thought was so so.
Cool because she used blotting powders.
Instead of an actual bronzer or contour.
It gave her a really really light washed.
A color which i thought was super super.
Dope i've never seen that done before.
And i think that by adding that light.
Wash the color instead of like the.
Intense bronzer in contour and by far.
Gave that contour the most accurate to.
The original picture of jacqueline and i.
Loved how it looked and then finally for.
The ultimate over my artists use the.
Anasazi beverly hills contour kit this.
Is definitely one my all-time favorites.
Their products are so good and blend out.
So smoothly it wasn't the best contra.
But it also wasn't the worst now when it.
Comes to the nose i'm using a morphe.
M4a3 3 brush in the same exact shades.
From the kat von d shade and light.
Palette and i'm drawing my nose contour.
Very very tight together i'm not gonna.
Talk about my nose contour in respect to.
My sephora makeover because i did not.
Ask for it to be contoured which is.
Definitely my faults that one is out of.
The picture but i did ask for a pinched.
Nose contour at both mac and ulta and i.
Think that the result of both were.
Honestly not the best it is definitely.
Not like the nose contour and mac or.
Alta looked bad by any means it.
Literally took me a year to figure out.
How to actually contour my nose and make.
It look decent rather than just editing.
It in every single photo so i really.
Don't blame them at all.
But i definitely do think it both.
Makeovers if i say pinched nose it could.
Have been a little bit smaller and then.
Once again get er done by laura mercier.
Translucent setting powder and my damp.
Beauty blender and i'm going to lightly.
My face to really intensify in my nose.
Contour and my cheekbone contour i.
Personally don't think it's that weird.
That none of the artists chose to bake.
Me today honestly a lot of people think.
That it's really really stupid and.
Doesn't really make a difference i.
Personally do see a difference.
Especially when it comes like the nose.
Contour baking the sides my nose has.
Literally changed my nose contour for.
The better but i don't blame them baking.
Is obviously a technique that started.
From dry-cleans and is slowly trickled.
Its way until i can online social media.
Makeup but i feel like hasn't fully.
Integrated into like the regular beauty.
World so i don't really think it's that.
Strange i ever won like i said i do love.
Baking so i'm just gonna do it on up.
Myself today.
To really intensify those highlights all.
Right so while my face is baking in the.
Oven at 350 degrees i'm gonna go into my.
Brows and for today's also gonna use my.
Benefit precisely my brow pencil i.
Always terrify brows are drawing little.
Hair like strokes in the center just to.
Add a little bit of dimension and fill.
Them in slightly but not make them super.
Super defined and then i'll just go in.
And start doing the tail all the tail.
More out as opposed to down this design.
That i actually recently changed my brow.
Routine too but i feel good is honestly.
Made the world of her difference it.
Makes my brows look more arch with stare.
For it just gives me a more like lifted.
And pretty look to my face and it also.
Gives me a lot more room for eyeshadow.
So i feel like drawing them out is my.
New favorite brow trick and it just.
Flatters my face really really well for.
Both my sephora and ulta makeovers my.
Artists use the anasazi at brown to.
Finer to define at my brows and for my.
Mac makeover she use the mac brow pencil.
Which i've actually never used before.
Brows are definitely a really really.
Personal thing when it comes to makeup i.
Feel like things such as like base.
Makeup contouring highlighting and then.
Like eyeshadow or very much like one.
Style fits most type of situation but.
Brows like frame the entire face they.
Can change your entire facial shape or.
Structure or expression so i feel like.
Brows are like a very very vital thing.
And are very very personal which is.
Probably why i didn't really like any of.
The brows for employee restore and i.
Definitely do how much to what i would.
Normally do i don't think any of the.
Eyebrows were particularly bad all of.
The ulta one definitely could have had a.
Little bit more attention paid to them.
But i just think they weren't really my.
Style and then just gonna go to my.
Benefit give me a brow gel just to brush.
Through all those hairs and lock them in.
Place you guys know that i am definitely.
Someone who has a lot of eyebrows that.
Is for sure so i always like to use a.
Brow so just make sure those hairs are.
Not gonna go.
Anywhere and they're gonna say it nice.
And defined all day long so once my.
Eyebrows are almost laid and in place on.
My eyelids are all primed and ready to.
Go for shadow and of course gonna do the.
Eyes and for today's like i'm gonna use.
The brand new morphe 15 d which is the.
Day slayer palette i'm first gonna grab.
The shade in the crease i'm i am 513.
Brush and put that shade in the crease.
Alexson use the m4 33 brush in the.
Shade editor and use that to deepen up.
The crease and the outer corner add my.
Sephora makeover my artists use the.
Sephora pro palette in the warm tones.
And by mac makeover she used individual.
Shadows and i my ultimate go over here.
Use the anasazi of modern renaissance.
Palette i felt a so for the actual color.
Of this eye look none of the makeovers.
Actually were that accurate to the.
Original i feel like all three of them.
Turned out very very red in the end.
Whereas this look is obviously super.
Super orange which is a little bit weird.
I remember at the sephora makeover the.
Honest i don't look was actually done.
Really really well but the gold shadow.
Used for the actual lid was just a.
Really strange color that didn't match.
Very well my mac makeover i think was.
The best eye shadow look overall it.
Looked very very beautiful and.
Well-planned it and then my alta.
Makeover i felt like my artist used the.
Closest technique to the original but it.
Was just a really really weird at crease.
Shape i'm exited i might add one to four.
Which is just a small packer brush and.
Dip into the shade mob and use this to.
It deepen up that outer v that are.
Sitting on my m4 33 one more time for my.
Last step and go over those edges to.
Make sure that there are no harsh lines.
They're gonna grab the brand-new morphia.
Cream shadow in the shade of bronze this.
From the new holiday collection you guys.
Have to check these out and i'm gonna.
Use that to carve out the lid and then.
Just add a little bit more glitter to.
Make it pop we're gonna grab the urban.
Decay heavy metal liquid glitter liner.
And just pop a tiny bit of that on the.
Lid when i came to the actual lid my.
Alte artist was the only one who.
Actually embraced the whole half cut.
Crease type of situation which was.
Definitely going on in the jacqueline.
Photo but even still all three artists.
Only use it i shadow for the actual base.
I found that a little bit weird because.
In the photo of joplin you can.
Definitely tell it there is a little bit.
Of a glitter situation going on i was.
Disappointed in the lid situation to all.
Three different locations especially.
Sephora and ulta because the steel and.
Liquid metals things are sold in both.
Locations and those are so beyond.
Beautiful i use those for almost all my.
Concrete's and they're extremely.
Glittery as well so i do wish something.
A little bit more glittery or true to.
The original photo was used so that is.
Why we're going extra glam.
Today for the lower lash seven person.
We're going to add four three three.
Brush and the shade editor and just buff.
That in and then just using ym5 13 brush.
That i have my original transition shade.
On i'm gonna go over those edges to make.
Sure they are really really blended out.
I'm then gonna grab an abbott one five.
One brush into the shade mauve and i'm.
Going to use is to hug at the waterline.
And then i'm just gonna line my lower.
Waterline today using the pretty vulgar.
Pencil and obviously the nude shade i.
Definitely like a good and new water.
Line i feels like it opens up the eye a.
Lot so now that the eye is all done the.
Next up is obviously going to be the.
Eyelashes and for today i picked up.
Through billie washes in the style doha.
I feel so these are the closest pair.
That i have that looks close to what.
Jacqueline was wearing so i'm just gonna.
Pop on this one today for my sephora.
Makeover i was given a sephora brand.
Lash fry mac makeover i was given a mac.
Brand lash and for my ultimate over i.
Had it in our dell brand lash all the.
Lashes were actually applied like the.
Artists all had a really good knowledge.
Of how to apply that right to the lash.
Line and how to make it the glue like.
Knock it i'll walk ian sucked my eye.
Clearly i don't have that knowledge.
Because i'm having a lot of trouble.
Putting this on right now.
Lashes are selma at least a part of my.
Makeup routine because they're always.
Are really really wonky free i don't.
Know what it is but i can just never get.
Okay example uh there are no gaps that.
Are comfortable to wear which is amazing.
But i felt as though all three.
Lifestyles were not really that close to.
The ones that jacqueline had on and i.
Would definitely not choose wear any of.
Them again alright guys that is when i.
All complete i'm gonna go ahead and.
Quickly do the other one on off-camera.
To save some time and i'll be right back.
To finish off the rest of this love.
Alright guys and those are both eyes off.
Complete and the next step is going to.
Be of course the glow before we go in.
And actually play anyhow later today i'm.
Gonna play a light spritz of these skins.
A navy eye makeup finishing spray i.
Always like to apply a little bit of.
Settings right before i apply my.
Highlighter just so it's really really.
Vibrant and of course you guys know i'm.
Gonna use my anasazi illuminator and so.
Hollywood and my morphe m 501 brush so.
My artists at both ulta and sephora use.
The chocolate health elaboration with.
Becca cosmetics champagne pop.
Highlighter and i thought it was so cute.
Sense obviously this look it's a.
Chocolate hill inspired look and then my.
Artist that mac used the soft and gentle.
Highlighter i thought my holly had all.
Three looks was decent they definitely.
Also had a little bit more vibrant i do.
Love a good glow and in the picture of.
Jacqueline she is definitely like.
Blinding the haters left right with your.
Highlight which i am love what i did.
Think was weird about the highlight from.
All three lunches that all three artists.
Use a really really big brush for.
Applying a highlighter don't get me.
Wrong i definitely love a good duyst.
Again luck you guys see me trying to.
Achieve it all the time but i do feel.
Like the replaces the highlighter should.
Be in place the highlighter shouldn't be.
And because of the size of the brush to.
All three artists use i didn't feel like.
The cheeks and like the under-eye region.
Was a little bit shinier than i.
Typically like it when it comes to.
Highlight me the nose i'm gonna once.
Again it got that tiny pencil brush and.
Just draw a really really thin line onto.
The tip and then down the nose bridge.
Once again going back to the contour.
Thing you guys know i love a pinched.
Nose and to achieve that with makeup it.
Definitely takes a lot of different.
Steps one of them is definitely using a.
Really really tiny brush privacy holly.
Is gonna bring the eye forward and draw.
Attention to it so by using a pencil.
Brush you're just furthering the.
Illusion and the only artist that did.
That was my back artist helen and it was.
So amazing and i felt like her nose.
Contour was by far the best.
And then finally to finish off this look.
Today i'm gonna go into the kat von d.
Liquid lipstick in the shade vampira.
When i first saw the photo of jacqueline.
This was the first liquid lipstick to.
Come to my head i feel so it'll be a.
Perfect match to the photo so i was so.
Excited to see my sephora artist playing.
This oh that my mac artist used the.
Carnivorous look on the website from.
The back and my altar artist he was the.
Anasazi logo that was in the shade.
Trust but then again we remember i.
Picked that one up from a band not him.
And yes what i'm applying this i'm.
Making sure to over line while applying.
This i did go ahead and add two coats.
Because as you remember it in the.
Sephora video and even looking in it.
Right now this lipstick is a little bit.
Streaky so i did want to make sure to.
Get it super super opaque and then.
Finally last but not least i'm gonna.
Finish this off using the skin to navy.
Eye makeup finishing spray alright guys.
And that is the beauty guru gets a.
Makeover at his own beauty station look.
All complete here is the finished look.
Now that you guys have seen my version.
With all of my favorite techniques and.
Products let's go ahead and compare all.
Four looks my first makeover was at.
Sephora and my artist was named crystal.
She was so so sweet my makeover ended up.
Costing me $50 and they rated it a 7 out.
Of 10.
My artists did a really really great job.
And this makeover was a little bit.
Different for the other ones in the.
Series because it was the first episode.
And i wasn't asking for specific things.
Like nose contour and for less harsh.
Bronzer and stuff like that so i don't.
Want to knock her too hard although i.
Did dislike the foundation i thought it.
So it wasn't really that full coverage.
And i felt as though some of the.
Eyeshadow tones were a little bit off.
From the original my next makeover was.
That mac my artist was helen it cost me.
$60 and i rated this makeover an 8 out.
Of 10 my artists had been working at mac.
For over 10 years and her expertise.
Really really showed her blending was.
Absolutely impeccable i love the eye.
Shadow on this look although i do wish.
She added a little bit more setting.
Powder because i started to get very.
Very oily very quickly and i felt as.
Though i was getting some creases and.
She also underlined my lips which i felt.
Wasn't really that flattering to my face.
Shape my next night cover was at ulta my.
Artist was darrell it cost me once again.
$60 that i ended up writing this.
Makeover a 7 out of 10 i really liked.
This makeover in the sense that he used.
A lot of the same products and.
Techniques that i usually use in my.
Normal routine such as too faced born.
This way foundation and turn shape tape.
Although there was some weird things.
That the pink of the foundation shade.
Was nowhere near my skin tone once i.
Left the store but that's like a whole.
Lighting situation that i don't even.
Want to get into and then of course my.
Cut crease was a little bit of a really.
Really wonky shape that i don't think.
Flattered my eyes now that we've.
Compared all the details of off for.
Makeovers let's compare them.
Side-by-side.
First we went to sephora.
Then he went to mac then was ulta and.
Then finally my own work looking at all.
Four of these books next to each other.
It is so cool to see all the different.
Techniques and products to use but all.
The different artists even though we.
Went into each experience with the same.
Exact photo i think it is the r is so.
Cool that each look looks very very.
Different and unique in their own ways.
There are things that i love on each.
Look and there are also things that i.
Don't love as much but overall i think.
All three makeovers were a huge success.
In the end taking into consideration the.
Final look techniques use products use.
Prices and just treatment overall i.
Think my grand prize winner for this.
Makeover finale is mac getting a mac.
Makeover i felt incredibly comfortable.
The entire time my artist was super kind.
It was definitely extremely.
Knowledgeable about the makeup process.
Which obviously you want if you're.
Getting a glam makeover well $60 wise on.
The higher end of the price tags for the.
Makeovers i felt as though i was.
Definitely paying for expertise i feel.
As though the things that i didn't like.
As much about the look being the lack of.
Setting powder and the underlined lips.
Are two things that can really easily be.
Fixed by simply saying something.
Obviously you guys watching this know.
That i tried to say as little as.
Possible just to see what the artist.
Would come up with on their own but.
Obviously if you're gonna get makeup.
Done you should speak up because any.
Artist is being paid to paint your face.
And to make you look good so you should.
Be getting what you want as a client.
Even though mac was my personal winner.
Today i definitely wanna hear from you.
Guys which out of the four looks was.
Your favorite did you like the sephora.
Look the mac look the ulta look or my.
Look at the best leave me a comment down.
