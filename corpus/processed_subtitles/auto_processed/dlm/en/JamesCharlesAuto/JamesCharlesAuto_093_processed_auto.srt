Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel as.
You guys all know last friday was the.
World premiere of maya brandon reality.
Competition show instant influencer and.
I just wanted to take a few minutes in.
The beginning of today's video to say a.
Major major thank you i'm filming this.
On a saturday which means the show.
Actually came out yesterday and i was.
Literally crying all day long i was such.
A huge mess because of the reaction and.
The comments that literally could not.
Have been more positive and i am so.
Incredibly grateful and i cannot wait.
For you guys to see the rest of the.
Episodes in a season because honestly.
They just keep getting better and better.
And better just like last week's.
Premiere episode two will be uploaded.
Once again this upcoming friday on my.
Youtube channel right here at 12 p.m.
Est streaming for free that i am look at.
That make sure you click the.
Notification bellow and down below so.
You don't miss the notification when i.
Upload episode 2 about being said.
Welcome to today's video obviously it is.
Tuesday so unfortunately there is not a.
New instant influencer episode today but.
I thought i'd be really cool for our.
Videos in between the episodes on.
Tuesdays to do something in relation to.
The last week's episode i thought it'd.
Be fun to discuss some comments and some.
Constructive criticism from you guys.
About the show also discussing the.
Elimination so warning right now there.
Will be spoilers ahead if you have not.
Yet watched the episode make sure you.
Click right up here and go watch it now.
Before watching today's video and just.
Overall spilling some tea about the show.
And more information that you guys.
Didn't get to see from behind the scenes.
In episode 1 all the contestants were.
Challenged with making a marketing.
Campaign video around a makeup product.
That already exists in the industry a.
Lot of the videos were really really.
Cool up one of them that stuck out the.
Most me it was palin's and she had a.
Beauty sponge as her item how to do your.
Full face with one tool in one tool only.
The real techniques beauty sponge of.
Course we all have a million beauty.
Sponges we even used them every single.
Day when we're getting ready but i.
Really liked kalin's video because she.
Interviewed her personality she really.
Made me want to buy the product and she.
Also had a theme for the video which was.
Using a beauty blender for your full.
Face of makeup.
Now obviously i'm pretty sure and.
Kaylynn's commercial she was only.
Talking about her base but when i was.
Watching her on the judging panel my.
Gear start attorney and i was like oh my.
God this would kind of be a fun.
Challenge but i hadn't at least seen.
Many people do so for today's video.
Inspired by a miss kailyn of brown at.
The show i let a guy my duty's funds.
That i use on an everyday basis.
And see if i can do my full face of.
Makeup using only a beauty blender while.
Filling some tea about the show let's.
Get started.
Music.
All right you guys say one thing the.
Comments section on the first episode.
And when threw in screenshotted a ton of.
Different things that i want to talk.
About in today's video but obviously we.
Do have a challenge to do in kayla's.
Video she used the real techniques.
Sponge so in mine i'm gonna grab my.
Personal favorite which is from a juna.
1ko it's a microfiber one so it's really.
Kind of like fluffy and just applies.
Everything really really beautifully i'm.
Gonna grab my touch out water cream.
Which is my oyster iser and start off.
With some skincare using my sponge i've.
Actually never done this before but you.
Definitely can so we're just gonna i.
Guess grab some on there and to start.
You know applying it to the face also.
I'm aware that my face looks a little.
Bit crazy right now i promise as much as.
It looks like it i did not go crazy with.
The blush unfortunately i fell asleep in.
The sun a few days ago and i forgot to.
Put on sunblock which is a major lesson.
To you guys always wear sunscreen and i.
Got very burnt oh lois look at how that.
Looks on camera i have never had a sign.
That hurts as much it literally was.
Painful just to put on their shirt today.
Were filming this youtube video so.
Please do not comment about my.
Foundation matching okay i'm gonna try.
My best.
I've been applying my olivera just let.
Me be and wear your sunscreen always the.
First comment that i want to address.
While i'm doing up my foundation of my.
Yet beauty sponge is this one from zee.
Mystery and they said i really.
Appreciate that it's free especially.
During these times.
Now this comet makes me a berry oh i.
Forgot to call it cracked well too late.
Now.
Now this comet makes me very very happy.
To hear because it was super important.
To us that everybody was able to you.
Know watch the show and enjoy it for.
Free what's actually crazy though is.
That we filmed the entire show in.
January when corona was not even a thing.
Here in america yet so our decision to.
Make the show free literally nothing to.
Do with the parents out there it was.
Actually a goal of ours from day one and.
When we were talking to our production.
Company and our partners for the show.
Which obviously ended up being a youtube.
Originals it was like literally a thing.
That we negotiated inside we are not.
Doing this if it's not gonna be free so.
We're very grateful that we were able to.
Make that happen so everybody could.
Access it and we're even more grateful.
That it is free during these really.
Really hard times because everyone stuck.
At home it's fun enjoyable content and i.
Know you all have really important.
Things to spend your money on right now.
Like bills and staying alive during this.
Awful awful awful time so i will say.
That i really really.
Want to continue to do more high.
Production content for free in the.
Future as well so fingers crossed they.
Were able to continue to make that.
Happen.
The base is looking at gorgeous so far.
Is that cheating's i just cheap fix plus.
I just bring down my face i wasn't.
Thinking about it so the basis a lot and.
Now i'm going to go in and start to.
Cream contouring and i'm going to use.
The tarte shape cape in the shade d i'm.
Just going to put this on the back of my.
Hand and ones in a little bit with the.
Foundation this next comment that i want.
To very quickly talk about is from.
Lorelei la fran boys la fram boys a loss.
And she says is someone gonna tell james.
That he was meant to be a host this.
Comment literally oh that is not the.
Color that i want to be using right now.
Ah that's a skin oh my god oh my god are.
You serious oh come on.
Well okay this is gonna be a bronzer i.
Saw this comment so many times on.
Yesterday's video and i'm not gonna go.
Super in-depth on this because the whole.
Point of this video is not to compliment.
Me but i want to say a major major thank.
You to the people who noticed this and.
Comment to this because it means so much.
To me you guys know that i wanted to be.
Some like this for a very very long time.
And as excited as i was to get started.
On set i was very very nervous.
Episode 1 and i don't really get nervous.
Really for anything i kind of go into.
Everything like ready to go but.
Obviously this was such a new experience.
For me and i was surrounded by industry.
Professionals that were working on the.
Shelves the last thing that i wanted to.
Do was you know get on set and embarrass.
Myself and how big to redo takes a.
Million times and of course we still had.
Every do quite a lot of things and get.
You know good audio clips and video.
Clips of everything but as we really.
Started getting into filming even on.
Like day one i just felt so confident in.
It and really felt like this is what i'm.
Meant to be doing and if you guys.
Thought i was good in episode 1 it.
Literally got way way way better by the.
Time of the finale so this means a lot.
Thank you for saying this thank you for.
Noticing this and i definitely want to.
And have plans to host so other things.
This week is from aisha and she said cry.
I love them hashtag instant influencer.
With a screen shot of indigo and kailyn.
In the workroom after.
Elimination i just want to put this in.
There because first of all i told you.
All that you were going to love the.
Contestant and so what so glad that like.
Literally everybody was obsessed with.
Everybody on the show all six of them.
Were so much fun it's such a pleasure to.
Work with and be on that way that an all.
Of us are still in a group chat to this.
Day and we talk all the time and have.
Been so excited about the show and i.
Have just been really really itching for.
All of you guys to get to watch them and.
To fall in love with your favorite and.
Depalo and support them everybody has.
Been like any a ridiculous amount of.
Followers on social media since.
Yesterday's premiere which is so so cool.
Obviously that's the point of the show.
But at the end of the day though you.
Guys as the viewers get to really make.
The final decision of who you know you.
Want to follow and support so keep.
Loving that i'm so glad you guys do.
Great and last but not least before we.
Jump into a powder i'm gonna grab the.
Covergirl clean fresh clean the.
Covergirl clean fresh cream blush i.
Don't really love cream blushes or cream.
Highlighters or liquid highlighters worn.
Liquid blushes or really liquid anything.
Why would you say that like you boo me.
It's such a like this duck summit comes.
From oliver and he says this is a great.
Show thank you so much for someone who.
Is personally not really into makeup i.
Enjoyed it so much it wasn't too long it.
Was exciting and the contestants are so.
Talented true i wish we could see the.
Contestants talking while the judges.
Deliberate thank you for leaving a.
Constructive criticism in a really.
Really cool way i love reading a start.
To criticism and seeing what you guys.
Want to see in the show it was actually.
Kind of weird because we didn't plan on.
Filming anything of the contestants.
While they were in that like holding.
Room before going back to their video.
Mobs mostly because we didn't really.
Plan for that like to be a full set so.
That room literally looked awful on.
Camera but once we got the footage back.
That the contestants like talking to.
Each other and like gossiping and.
Talking about the judging and the.
Challenges we were like oh this is gold.
Like we have to include this in the show.
Which is why i love being there despite.
The fact that it looks you know not the.
Best and we definitely longer do this.
For season two and who knows it might.
Even end up being something that we post.
Like on an insta influence or separate.
Channel because that's like a lot of.
Really good side contact but i think you.
Guys would love to see as well so.
Definitely us know and definitely keep.
Us posted with more cultural criticism.
And feedback we'd love to see it and we.
Obviously want to make the show the best.
That it possibly.
Hanabi so wednesday ina thank you oliver.
For the suggestion okay there's hardly.
Time to set this base in place god bless.
I don't want any more creases so i'm.
Just gonna grab my beauty sponge at once.
Again and dip right into my translucent.
Setting powder and we're going to lock.
It in all right you guys that's pretty.
Much the base for now all completes and.
Of course the next step is going to be a.
Brows an eye shadow i'm gonna be.
Skipping my brows because i think they.
Look okay and there's just no way that.
Anything is gonna happen with the brows.
I do want to try to do eyeshadow i'm.
Going to quickly go to the bathroom and.
Give at both of these beauty blenders a.
Quick little cleaning because they're.
Very very dirty but i'll be right back.
Zoomed in to try to create a look okay.
So for eyeshadow today i do have some.
Cream shadows that i found in my.
Collection i have never actually used.
These before i've never even used a.
Cream eyeshadow if i'm gonna be honest i.
Don't have high hopes for this but i'm.
Just gonna try it out and see where.
Things go.
Okay so long's really got this eye.
Shadow i wanted to talk a little bit.
About the judges in the episode and what.
You guys have thought about that this.
Card from abuse s says paris is well.
Abdul james is randy jackson and or.
Veena is simon cowell this comment.
Definitely gave me a cute little giggle.
Yesterday because if you're an original.
American idol fan you know oh geez paris.
Obviously came in and was super super.
Nice to the contestants which made sense.
Because usually when you're a guest.
Judge on the show that's like the role.
That that person fills and then i.
Obviously as the host was kind of like i.
Wouldn't say like neutral because i.
Definitely gave quite a lot of criticism.
So i tried to match like all of my.
Criticism with a positive as well so.
That way the contestants are able to you.
Know use that information to their.
Advantage if they make it on to the next.
Challenge.
And then obviously at noir veena is.
There and she gave quite a lot of you.
Know more serious critiques and there.
Was quite a lot of comments about it.
Glossy fox said it the face of novena.
Makes are killing me.
Ariana guzman said i love nor venus.
Christian show criticism she really.
Knows what she's doing yes i would 1000%.
Have to agree nor veena is one of you.
Know my closest friends in the industry.
But she's also you know the creative.
Director and a leader of a.
Billion-dollar makeup brand that all of.
Us know and love so honestly for me it.
Was like a no-brainer to ask taormina to.
Be on the show nor vina brings so many.
Really really strong critiques and.
Knowledge to these contestants from what.
She's learned from working the industry.
For the past several.
And it's really really good i love her.
Because she's so brutally honest but.
Sometimes later in this industry you.
Really need to hear that because it's.
Those cupboards that can really take you.
To the next level if you take in that.
Information and use it to your advantage.
Instead of taking it to heart this looks.
Terrible oh this is a bad choice okay.
You guys i'm just gonna stop here on the.
Eyeshadow and move on to the rest of the.
Face to finish off this challenge i knew.
This is a bad idea okay i called it.
There's the footage exists i never even.
Used a cream eyeshadow if i'm gonna be.
Honest i don't have high hopes for this.
And it definitely was i don't think it.
Looks awful but yeah i definitely prefer.
My morphe brushes heyday of the week to.
Beauty blender all right you guys so.
While we work on finishing up this look.
And finishing up this challenge i want.
To talk about probably the thing that.
Has been most controversial or comments.
About since episode one and that is the.
Elimination also once again if you have.
Not seen the episode please like right.
Up here because spoiler alerts are.
Coming right now and i don't wanna ruin.
It if you guys want to watch it academy.
Does mess i'm a huge fan of how the.
Elimination is set up it's not made to.
Embarrass the person that is being sent.
Home james tells you personally it you.
Two are alone and he encourages you to.
Keep doing youtube videos james have you.
Read this you're doing a great great job.
Thank you so much ekaterina richard why.
He just says the ending is a bit weird.
And the girl is so emotional but.
Suddenly having to draw her youtube.
Channel wall she's about to cry leah.
Says everyone's like no paris but james.
Was so nice to britney when she was.
Eliminated i cried omg alright so i'm.
Going to highlight using my morphe cream.
Highlighting second the number effect.
One no matter what reality show you're.
Watching the eliminations are always a.
Little bit controversial because of.
Course everybody has you know they're.
Different favorites everybody has.
Different beliefs as to you know who did.
Best in what challenges who should have.
What home who should have stayed etc etc.
Originally we did actually have it.
Planned to do the eliminations kind of.
In like the typical reality style format.
Where we just tell you know the winner.
And the loser in the judging room but.
Since this is like a influencer slash.
Like content creation based show we.
Thought it would be kind of cool to tie.
And elimination with that whole theme.
And we came up with the idea of doing.
The video lab elimination i personally.
Really really liked how they turned out.
Because obviously it's good.
Entertainment and that is the point of.
Creating a show also further points the.
Account arena brought up which is one.
It's much more personal just send.
Somebody home.
Because you actually get to sit down and.
Talk to them face-to-face to hold her.
Hand to hug them to make sure that.
They're good but also to give them a.
Constructive criticism and feedback for.
One last time of what they can do to you.
Know better themselves in their career.
Moving forward nothing it's like.
Embarrassing but i would prefer to be.
Eliminated in private and not in front.
Of all my cast mates who happen to do.
Better i guess it's just because like i.
Don't like that type of confrontation um.
So i really do it worked out.
Obviously yes brittany was very very.
Emotional being sent home and yeah sure.
I guess it's fair to say that it may.
Have been a little bit awkward to launch.
Brittany you know cry and have to prohm.
Or herself on camera but first of all.
It's better to promo yourself all crying.
That i'm probably herself at all and.
That's the whole point of the show is to.
Give it smaller artist platforms that i.
Think really really deserve it and we.
Almost wanted to bring it like a full.
Circle and tie it back to being an.
Actual influencer and filming a youtube.
Video obviously it's an episode of a.
Show which is not exactly the same thing.
But you guys are used to seeing me at.
The end of all my videos sign-off and.
You know do my little promo and get you.
Guys to follow the other socials and.
That's the last thing that you guys get.
To see of me on all my content so we.
Thought it'd be really cool to give it.
The artists who do get sent home one.
Last opportunity to shine to plug.
Themselves and to you know make the last.
Impression before going home i'll write.
You guys the only thing i'm missing left.
In this look is going to be at the lips.
So i'm gonna grab that crema covergirl.
Blush once again that i use on my cheeks.
And just a little bit of that on the.
Back to my hand and i'm going to use my.
Mini beauty blender to finish off the.
Slock i just applied some mascara off.
Camera because let's be real this look.
Was looking a little bit busted without.
It and i thought the lips are data that.
Is this full face using only a beauty.
Blender all complete you guys i had up.
So much fun at doing this challenge.
Tonight and also addressing some.
Comments and questions that you guys had.
About the show i hope i answered some.
Questions and further clarify it at some.
Things as much as putting this look.
Together was a little bit of a mess i.
Honestly don't really think it came out.
That bad and i am obsessed i think this.
Looks so beautiful especially using the.
Cream blush and cream highlighter to i.
Was on the biggest fan of them but.
Honestly i might want to use them a.
Little bit more often at the eyes on the.
Other hand i wanted to try it out okay.
It was definitely a fail but and then a.
You guys try out this challenge and do.
Get a successful loss.
