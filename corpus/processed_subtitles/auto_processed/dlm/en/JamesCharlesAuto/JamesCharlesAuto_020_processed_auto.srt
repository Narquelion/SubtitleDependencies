Blending brushes and now i'm here it is.
A very very special day if you guys are.
Following me for a while you know that.
I'm not really like a party animal i.
Don't really drink or definitely don't.
Do any drugs and i just basically mind.
Their own business panna stay home and.
Do my thing so i don't really have.
Anything crazy plan for today's special.
Events so because of that i decided to.

Have nails my answer for you is.
Carefully i'm gonna be probably my face.
Using my benefit porefessional primer as.
Always i'm getting beating you guys for.
Three hours you typically want to make.
Sure my face is locked all the way in.
Place i honestly am so excited i barely.
I'm ready to do a meet and greet just.
Because they're always so have taken so.
Crazy and very very hard to plan as well.
So i'm super excited that i get to do it.
At morphe of all places because y'all.
Know sister james loves her morphe i.
Feel like i've already been at 17.
Forever this year where it's so slow but.
There were like so many amazing.
Helping and so many not so amazing.
Things too but i'm so thankful for you.
Guys that i've like stuck with me.
Through the entire thing i'm a human.
Being i'm growing i'm learning i.
Definitely got into the industry it's.
Super super quickly and i really really.
Young it was just amazing i'm so.
Thankful for everything that i.
Accomplished and achieved and all of you.
Guys but at the same time it definitely.
Pushed me to learn it and educate myself.
Very very quickly i definitely made a.
Lot of mistakes and i said a lot of.
Things that i shouldn't have but i think.
That it's important to know that as.
Human beings we all make mistakes and.
That the only thing you can do.
Appreciate you know take them back it's.
Just grow and better yourself as a.
Person i'm so excited for what this year.
Has to hold i can promise you guys there.
Are a lot of really really cool things.
That are happening right now on behind.
The scenes that i can't talk to you.
About just yet but definitely keep your.
Eyes peeled because i'm working here on.
The lot.
I'm just genuinely so committed to work.
I feel as i was already super super.
Motivated beforehand but moving to la.
Everybody here has like a major agenda.
Everybody here has something to do and.
Living here just really pushes me to.
Work so hard and be the best version of.
Myself and just get a whole lot of.
I feel like i'm a boss ass    when.
I'm here and i absolutely love it oh my.
God i just i'm so excited for you guys.
To see it work like what's coming i.
Honestly have no idea what makeup i'm.
Doing today i'm just starting with my.
Face i'm gonna figure it out i feel like.
When i'm taking a lot of pictures i need.
To do really really light makeup but at.
The same time we're gonna kind of let me.
Go but i'm definitely not having a good.
Skin day today which is annoying.
Days today would be the one to hop if.
It's goodbye hey but of course that's.
How my luck work i was up so they last.
Said with all the sisters they all came.
Over and surprised me have been they.
Literally is so cute and like a friend.
At kamut i sent me a pizza so we all.
Shouted down the coolest runs in the.
Entire bell that i'm so so happy right.
Now i remember as a child always wanting.
To be the 18 so badly and now that i'm.
Actually here everything is like exactly.
The same i mean it's gonna help every.
Birthday room obviously but i just.
Remember being like oh my god i want to.
Be 18 so that's i could be illegal if.
Don't do all these fun things but like.
Now actually being here like i don't do.
Anything anyway.
It's so crazy because i've been living.
Alone for a few months now and i started.
That they were when i was 17 i graduated.
Early and moved across the country which.
Is something that a lot of people can't.
Even say when they're 18 or 19 so i'm so.
Like i think i've always been very like.
Ahead of my age and older inside that i.
Was on my birth certificate i guess.
That's not so stupid but i really is the.
Truth the only thing i don't think a lot.
Of older people i don't think i'm a lot.
More mature than a lot of kids that are.
My age and i really get really really.
Cool to me right now.
I guess the only real exciting part.
About today is now i cannot legally have.
A grinder how about let's be real a lot.
Better do anything anyway so for my.
Brows that i'm going to use the ax.
Benefit persistent brow pencil on the.
Shaded number 4 i'm going to lightly.
Fill them in and sculpt them.
I'm honestly so excited for the next.
Upcoming weeks i go home back to new.
York with all the sisters for my senior.
Graduation and i am so beyond excited i.
Opened up a package for my parents.
Yesterday before my birthday and they.
May be like it's too little bunch.
Of like old cute baby photos in the end.
Photos from like my friends and stuff.
And i just started bawling i don't cry.
Like ever but oh opening that pocket.
Just really put it in perspective how.
Much i miss them so much.
I've been wanting to like move out and.
Just kind of be independent for as long.
As i could remember there's three years.
Old i was in my own apartment.
And like if you asked my mom she will.
Tell you this - hi boys then super super.
Independent but now that i actually live.
Alone i can't even explain how much i.
Miss my mom and things she would do for.
Me i really do miss her.
Last two times i've only make up for.
Some reason my brows keep coming out.
Really really uneven and it's really.
Starting to get on my last nerve.
I don't know what it's going on but one.
Side of the tail looks a lot like better.
Than the other one i guess and it's.
Father like i think i was so good to go.
Back home before graduation the only bad.
Part about it is that at the same.
Weekend as vidcon and i won't be able to.
Go well i've been getting so many to.
Meet some of you guys to ask you if i'm.
Going to be there and no i will not be.
At this year's vidcon i will however be.
A play let's dc but vidcon happens with.
The stain exactly again as my graduation.
And unfortunately i cannot skip it but i.
Am working with a really really iconic.
Designer to do something super super.
Cool my graduation gown so definitely.
It's stay tuned for that because it you.
Guys are definitely gonna want to see.
This you will be shipped to the corner.
In honor of today is morphine beyond.
Videos the 35o palette of course - it's.
My my eyes change for 10% off i think.
I'm gonna go something really light airy.
And smoking today just because a lot of.
