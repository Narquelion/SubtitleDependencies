What is this oh my god.
Not cries cutely on the thumbnail from.
The tatty apology video.
Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel.
A few years ago you guys know that i.
Released my first ever makeup.
Collaboration the james charles x morphe.
Palette and thanks to your guys's love.
And support it sold out in only a few.
Minutes flat which was absolutely crazy.
Because of that though within only a few.
Days there were fake.
Knock-off palettes popping up left and.
Right so i decided to film a video for.
My youtube channel.
Called testing out a fake james charles.
Palette where i did just.
That and a few years later little did i.
Know it will become one of my most.
Viewed videos.
Of all time since that video you guys.
Have been asking me non-stop to review.
More fake palettes but the only problem.
Is.
I haven't released any other makeup.
Products just yet although there have.
Not been any new fake palettes there has.
Been.
Quite a lot of fake james charles.
Products that have popped up online over.
The course of the past few years.
Of course you guys know i have my.
Clothing brand sisters apparel which by.
The way thank you so much for all the.
Love and support on the butterfly.
Collection but beyond just clothing.
There have been.
So many crazy products that i have never.
Actually released and we decided to buy.
Them all.
For today's youtube video i have no idea.
What we're going to be looking at today.
I have not seen.
Anything but i am very very nervous and.
Excited and probably ready to send a.
Whole lot of cease and desist letters to.
My lawyer as well.
Let's get started.
So this is the best of them why are you.
Starting off with the best one.
Um just to give you hope oh ripping away.
From you.
Okay are you talking about the best in.
Terms of production quality are the best.
Just in terms of the actual item.
Yes okay so here we go okay i'll put my.
Hands up can you see my hands on camera.
Okay.
This feels like a piece of clothing can.
I open my eyes now yeah.
Okay what is this oh my god.
This t-shirt is the worst quality that.
I've ever felt this feels like a bandana.
This feels like the motel sticks on exit.
Or motel six is that what that's what.
It's called right.
I'm out of touch uh like bed sheet yeah.
I would never in a million years do this.
This is.
Hideous also like like they couldn't.
Have even gotten like a high resolution.
Image.
Okay let's try this on i'm so scared.
That looks like it's built for someone.
That's the body of a fiji water bottle.
Like oh.
Oh my gosh this neckline.
Is disgusting this is literally like an.
Eight-year-old girl's like.
Pajama t-shirt they couldn't even get.
Like all your hair in it.
Music.
And your hair just went right into it oh.
That would be good literally the most.
Disgusting thing you've ever suggested.
What is this it was expensive how much.
Was that well that was at least like 40.
Bucks.
What this is forty dollars i don't think.
Anything we bought was below thirty.
Dollars.
Child anyways see the seven about this.
Is that people probably.
Do actually buy that do not buy.
Literally the only place to buy.
James charles officials this is.
Merchandise at cysterwigs.com i don't.
Make this video like an actual.
Commercial for like our brand but like.
At this point it should be oh my god do.
I dare even like.
Crop it i don't know i was gonna try to.
Rip it.
Music.
Oh surprisingly it's actually it's.
Pretty darn full.
Music.
Oh should we like write these oh sure.
What are the out of ten.
Zero oh happy halloween oh god can i.
Open now.
Oh my god put it on my favorite part is.
The nose hair.
It's so okay oh my god i need you to.
Give a good.
Zoom in oh the nose hairs like.
What do you see there's like weird i.
Wonder if these are punch outs.
Oh oh.
Oh there is no mouth hole that's weird.
You don't get the top.
Probably for the better so none of those.
Tick talkers can do a disgusting.
Impression of me.
Hi sisters here happy halloween.
Music.
It bobbles.
James charles smile mask celebrity.
Cutouts.
Period celebrities i'm a celebrity.
Okay i'm ready for the next one this is.
Scary how will we venture into.
Just one fake sister's apparel item.
Please i would love to see a fake system.
Hair lighter.
Let me just say that this item is out of.
This world.
Oh gosh oh no.
Yikes literally all they did was take a.
Picture of the galaxy from google and.
Blow it up this actually looks like i.
Put this hoodie into photoshop and then.
Like put a nice blur on it.
And now i'm looking at it somehow that.
Being said like why would it kind of be.
Cute to do like a galaxy collection for.
Sisters apparel.
That's not the one no this is not it.
This hoodie will not be part of it.
Like that would be like that would kind.
Of be everything the inside of this.
Hoodie feels like a camping tent.
Like a sleeping bag but not a good one.
How much was this.
This is trash oh it's also extra what.
The oh my god it's like stretch fabric.
It might be a tent well this is.
Definitely fun.
I think the worst part about this is.
That it was 38 for this piece of trash.
And like an actual sister's hoodie.
That's good quality and gorgeous.
It's 45 like it's only a few dollars.
More for the difference between.
This and a real one like.
I want to make sure that you're covered.
On both ends of your body sure.
Yeah is this a skirt you've got to.
Kidding me this is the pencil skirt.
With this disgusting photo of me on this.
From like 2017.
You know what's he oh my god you're the.
Worst part about this this photo is from.
The sister's apparel website they.
Literally went on our website.
Stole one of my images from our actual.
Merch and then went and produced.
Other merchandise with our photos my.
Favorite part is the hair cut off on the.
Back end of the skirt.
Oh you're probably wondering where's my.
Hair oh it's right there oh god do i try.
This on this is the thumbnail for sure.
Oh my feet are asleep.
Let's just go over oh.
Oh miss teacher i need to stay after.
Class this has to be a joke.
Wait that shakes your ass so nicely.
Oh my gosh.
It's a little bit long i would prefer a.
Little bit more of a.
School dress code if you want yeah but.
That's okay sure.
Oh i'm so sorry mr smith i didn't see.
That there oh i liked mr smith.
Obviously different name oh.
Music.
Oh i'm so sorry mr rogers i didn't see.
You there.
Music.
This is better than all the other ones.
So far this is my favorite piece so far.
Ready for my next item.
Okay oh i don't.
Yeah i don't think i could open up the.
Shirt oh my.
Literal this is homophobic the fact that.
This exists on the.
Planet earth is in fact homophobic this.
Photo.
Is from my old youtube channel this has.
To be a thumbnail or a screen.
Hey guys it's james whoa last year i.
Thought i was being really organized by.
Using binders for every class but let me.
Tell you no one has probably ever had.
This on their entire life.
You're about to before.
Middle after a good glob.
This is a negative 643 out of ten.
Negative there's a little sticker to.
Maybe put on your folder your binder.
Music.
Who made this whoever produces is sick.
In the head sick.
Use code james for 10 off a checkout i.
Mean hey at least some at least.
At least a.
There she is more womanly.
Yeah more more lately.
Music.
Oh my god is this a literal dress.
Music.
Swear to a baby shower this smells like.
Um.
Like stale brownie mix don't smell it no.
I was really hoping this was gonna have.
Like some shade to it right did you.
Actually think this was gonna have some.
Shade to it.
I mean the skirt was gorge that.
Is.
She walks into class and just says and.
She's white man.
White just to clarify oh my classes.
Music.
See.
Music.
Yeah get out of my closet i would rate.
This a solid eight out of ten the.
Airflow.
Great comfortable sure could be a little.
Bit more.
Fitted to the body to really show off.
And accentuate the features you know but.
I'm not gonna i'm not gonna penalize.
That some people love a more loose.
Fitting.
Look isn't it the penalized.
Oh this feels weird oh my god.
Oops not cries cutely on the.
Thumbnail from the tatty apology video.
Sure first of all the fabric is canvas.
Sort of an outdoor pillow a patio pillow.
If you will.
For perhaps a rocking chair on the front.
Porch.
A hammock show or a hammock crying.
Cutely in the hammock.
Outside.
Oh my god i don't know why is this not.
Stinging.
Ready to open.
Look yeah you i don't want to uh.
Oh.
Music.
Oh my god i feel sick to my stomach.
About this.
I was literally swelling through getting.
Images probably two weeks ago you were.
All here at the counter.
And i was literally talking about this.
Is the worst paparazzi.
That exists ever everything of all this.
Is disgusting.
Disgusting and not much better for what.
You're wearing now of course.
I disagree i think this is very cute.
See this all worked out.
You know who probably has bought this.
Online it's done the same thing.
No no hey hey.
Oh sure.
Okay well i was honestly really enjoying.
Filming this video today up until that.
Very last moment that cardboard cutout.
Completely ruined.
Everything i think that's all we have.
For today's video i honestly had a lot.
Of fun going through all these fake.
Items and trying everything on.
I would not recommend any of these.
Products in today's video.
The pricing was ridiculously high for.
Some reason the quality of most of them.
Is absolute trash.
And most importantly i don't know where.
Any of these items are actually coming.
From and if you want to get any official.
James charles items the only place to.
Shop is sisters.apparel.com.
