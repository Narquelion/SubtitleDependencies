Of the hype house just by being in that.
First photo.
It was establish a moment exactly still.
Like it just happened like it didn't.
Even mean it wasn't even like on.
Intentionally or anything i was just.
Like i was in the photos and then that's.
When the hype house began it's like you.
Know what when you what was the word you.
Used or is i presume that any resides.
And i'm resigned and decided to pursue.
Other dreams you know that's so cool.
Mm-hmm i think i really appreciate that.
Details okay so one thing that you.
Mentioned about your mom being.
Supportive i think is really cool what.
Is it like having your parents like.
Involved with the whole tik-tok.
Situation like active on it yeah cuz.
Your parents are both tech talk stars as.
Well yeah so my mom she started it.
Because i was making videos with her so.
Like my first videos to actually blow up.
Were with my mom.
Ya know the really big blow up ones so.
She ended up making a tick-tock account.
Because everyone was like oh my gosh.
Your mom should have her own so she made.
Her own and like now she has i think.
Like three million over three million.
Fires i think she has 3.5 million.
Dollars so she like kind of established.
Her own little you know thing on.
Tick-tock right i always like love and.
Respect to someone comparin sar involved.
With like their kids dreams and stuff.
Like i was very grateful and blessed as.
Well to have super super supportive.
Parents yeah i'm very very very grateful.
For that already okay so the base is all.
Done we literally just talked for like.
An hour so sorry i didn't really.
Walkthrough pick up but we're gonna go.

Brown by the way okay so now that you're.
Out here in la officially and you're.
Also with the hypose to effie week so.
You guys did a big like entertainment.
Tonight.
Interview and like it was like the first.
Time like the height most ever did like.
Something as a group which was super.
Interesting to watch but there was a lot.
Of criticism in the comments and adjust.
Ages from people in general but like.
Think tick tock errs do nothing so like.
What does the day-to-day schedule of.
Addison rate look like and just like.
Walk us to it because even from like.
Hanging out you guys it's definitely not.
Nothing like that's for sure yeah so.
Like being on tick tock i feel like.
People do have like the idea that it is.
A bunch of nothing and like we're just.
Saying our rims and like making videos.
And it's super easy but i feel like on.
Youtube you have to make good content or.
Like people aren't gonna watch it it's.
Like the same thing so like yeah it may.
Be a 15-second video but it's like you.
Want to make it the best 15 seconds that.
Anyone's ever watched you know so like.
It goes with like a lot of time and.
Learning the dances coming up with the.
Dances coming up with skin and yeah tick.
Tock maybe a 15-second video but it's.
Like when we're working on other.
Platforms as well like i've been doing.
Youtube videos and then like doing.
Instagrams and like really active on.
Like twitter and snapchat it's like it's.
All a big job even from me try to learn.
Like dances and stuff it takes you like.
At least 30 minutes to an hour every.
Time but i want to do well because i can.
Never figure them out useful yeah okay.
You guys both brows are all done i think.
Their looks are you like i love them.
Okay before this eye shadow look today i.
Have a fun idea and i hope that you are.
Done for this before we're rolling the.
Camera today honest and i were talking a.
Lot about how like obviously it's really.
Important for both of us to be a good.
Role model in front of our audiences.
Good morning sisters but like one of my.
Biggest things for this year has been.
Like being a little bit more.
Unapologetically myself yeah the last.
Four years i've treated my job super.
Professionally which obviously it should.
Be but this year i've been carrying a.
Little bit less and trying to have more.
Fun and being more out there like.
Censoring myself a little bit less and.
You're gonna say oh you want to do the.
Same thing right yeah cuz you're.
Twinning exactly i have been doing a lot.
Of colorful looks on people lately and i.
Of course love doing it colorful makeup.
Hello it is literally like my entire.
Brand for this video would it be okay i.
Really want to give you like a super.
Super mature like red carpet glam i love.

Bit of senore let's jump right in okay.

On a camera then we'll do the other.
Camera so i'm just gonna get started.
Offer so using some hoola bronzer.
Actually before i even jump into any.
Eyeshadow just to connect the nose.
Contour into the crease serenity's.
Mentioning how like a lot of people.
Don't obviously understand like what.
Goes on behind the scenes and i think.
It's a lot more work but one thing that.
I really really really really really.
Commend you for and i've talked to do.
All the subtyping before him i'm gonna.
Say it on camera you are such a positive.
Person i started hanging out with like.

Translated to my personality on the.
Internet and like being very welcoming.
And being very positive and like keeping.
That side of me alive for me it's just.
Staying surrounded by the people that.
Make me feel like a better person and.
Then that kind of just makes everything.
Fall into place that's why i love being.
Around you oh because you're always.
Positive i'm sure we're gonna round you.
