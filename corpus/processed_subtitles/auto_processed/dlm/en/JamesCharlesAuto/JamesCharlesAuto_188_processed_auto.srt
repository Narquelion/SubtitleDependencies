Have a lot of things we want to talk.
About today so i'm down i'm an open book.
What i'm sure you guys all probably know.
If you were like well-versed in the.
Makeup community slash industry is that.
When i started the beauty industry me.
And jeff we've had serious be kinda have.
We did huh yeah like bad turn off my.
Sister scandal there's been a few.
Moments we just talked about them all.
Yeah great alright so we met in new york.
At actually the jacqueline's lon doctor.
Champagne pop james is at the party i.
Had flown to new york with some friends.
And we were there and i'd never met.
James before remember you came up to me.
I did i was super excited to meet.
Geoffrey yeah you guys know that i came.
Into this industry pretty fast.
Even though i was so growing as an.
Influencer i was still a major fan of.
All the people that were up there yeah.
Which i didn't even know at the time so.
Looking back on like ouch like people.
Were a little mean girl.
So i remember someone i was with was.
Like uh i don't really want you to take.
A picture of james and did it and it's.
Like this whole weird thing and i'm like.
I mean he's    cool he's a boy and.
Beauty like let's meet him he's younger.
Like i lived for and i loved your.
Artistry thank you i saw you use my.
Liquid lips like his liner and you were.
Just like full-on taking it there so i.
Was excited but it sucks when and i.
Could admit it even at my age that.
People do have an influence in like it.
On you yeah and when someone's in your.
Ear like kind of staying you kind of.
Follow along we're stuck so i was a.
Follower in a situation that i.
Definitely regret it yeah i mean i.
Apologize for that night being so short.
And annoying but you know looking back.
I'm like oh my god it's just so high.
School you know it sucks energy really.
Is very high school the next thing that.
Happened was a twitter battle and this.
Is when i was very small.
Oh mystery and i was doing a lot of like.
The crazy looks all the time that you.
Were just talking about like every day i.
Was pulling out some new look yeah and i.
Wasn't growing as fast as obviously i am.
Now because the thought that i was doing.
These crazy creative looks i will admit.
I definitely did have a little bit of.
Like an ego when i first came in ok and.
Lovely a groaner to say that though yeah.
Yeah absolutely.
And in my eyes i was getting frustrated.
The people like jeffery or manny who did.
More classic lamb were growing and.
Skyrocketing of fame when i was pulling.
Out these crazy career books and no one.
Has ever seen before and i was staying.
At the bottom yeah i remember tweeting.
Asking for my followers to send me ideas.
For creative videos or creative makeup.
Look ok yes somebody replied and said.
Like oh do swing inspired by manny and i.
Quoted it and literally said girl i said.
Creative you did take it there and i was.
With manny at that time and we were.
Sitting in a car going somewhere and oh.
Girl i was it was it was rough.
Ridiculous and it was so childish but at.
The time i was literally 16 i just how.
About sorority convicts and i had an ego.
And i will definitely be able to admit.
That now.
Of course my hurt feelings no it came.
Off very conscious i can't read things.
On the internet i can't read how.
Someone's talking it so it came off a.
Little harsh and i remember you.
Definitely hurt his feelings no like oh.
Girl james yeah so i know what's the.
Thing about james at that time me and.
Manny were just in the car like it was.
Bad once it turned into kind of like a.
Group beef with friends yes i mean know.
When people are really friends you're.
Loyal and you want to chime in like what.
So i remember me and joffrey start.
Arguing on twitter and then you had.
Addressed me and you had talked about.
How if i introduced myself to you that.
Night at the dock on the back call.
Yourself the next big thing of the.
Beauty industry and i was just like wait.
A sec that.
I may be a little bit you go testicle.
But i would never ever ever ever ever.
Write say that so i was so spooked i.
Instantly had texted manny trying to.
Squash the beef i'll apologise but it.
Was a little bit too late i couldn't.
Take back what i said yeah a little too.
Soon like sometimes people aren't ready.
To hear sorry right away be like get.
Over being angry or like their feelings.
Which obviously we both can definitely.
Attest get annoying for snap but it was.
A very interesting situation to say the.
Least.
Hmm but it sucked because i'm like every.
Number to like fix it oh really call you.
I was just more on the bane of like okay.
Whatever like you made that coming up.
Manny you guys can fix it but you guys.
Ended up fixing it yeah obviously i.
Apologize on a personal level too but.
Even in a business sense which i.
Definitely talk about later on in this.
Video here okay it's stupid to burn.
Bridges the people in your industry that.
You're forced to work with and you're.
Forced to see all the time so all the.
Time i always try to say drama-free.
Which geoffrey can't relate cannot.
Relate at all times but i think that is.
Why we're so different and i think.
That'll be an interesting conversation.
Later on as well i'm gonna contour okay.
I'm gonna use the lemare the pill dude.
The powder it's literally called the.
Powder it's so boozy that's all you get.
How much it cost that's like with tax.
$97 yeah i'm just gonna set my entire.
Face with this and my beauty blender.
Okay i'm gonna start contouring with the.
Anastacio classic contour kit all right.
And i'm gonna go in with my morphe m 5.
To 7 brush you can use code james at.
Checkout for 10% much your sister yes we.
Got foam drama to discuss the star i.
Mean look i'm carving out my cheekbones.
Hit me what's in him what's another good.
Moment oh that we would love to address.
A makeup repre party oh sister james.
Wants to go for the beheading i think we.
Do help me what really got us going good.
Here.
Whoo-hoo i'm sweating and my actual.
Indirect beef with geoffrey and it was.
With nikita yes and one day i was gonna.
Make up forevers party i had gotten.
Ready and i did a crazy blue glitter.
Look right i wasn't there.
You were not there no this is right when.
Kylie was first launching her makeup.
Line yes and i wore a black liquid.
Lipstick and it was a hundred percent.
Jefferies there's whether or not i hated.
Him there was no denying that he has a.
Good formula yeah and i tagged it when i.
Posted an insert picture as kylie no.
Shade literally just wanted the kylie.
Repos i was really close friends with.
Nikita still am and she came up to me.
And was like talking up my lips and.
Stuff and talking right look.
And she's like oh is that like a jeffrey.
Weirdo moment crush like she kind of.
Figured she had the best black on the.
Scene you know is this the kylie lip but.
I was like no it's jefferies and oh you.
Told her that yeah i did think nothing.
Of it.
Nikita hops right on snapchat and puts.
Her phone in my face it's driving me to.
Hell and back but i'm thinking if the.
Joe.
Once the stop had kind of completed i.
Realized oh my god wait this isn't a.
Joke at all and she was like looking.
Over i said please don't post that like.
Please do not post that actually here in.
The snapshots.
He's saying please do not post that but.
She did it went up anyway and i of.
Course was at the party so i don't know.
That it went up until two hours later.
After i had already left and was getting.
Thousands and thousands and thousands of.
Hate tweets from nikita's fans from your.
Fans from that whole squad calling me.
Out for being shady and for lying and.
Okay for being just like a shitty person.
I was so shocked and so upset you're.
Like does he not still be happening yeah.
So i called nikita like super scared.
Alarm like what the heck is going on.
Like help me sue's in the club so she.
Did not get my call finally after like.
Two hours of texting her she finally.
Answered and like we ended up solving.
And apologizing and resolving it but.
Because like so using my lipsticks but.
Y'all didn't tag it like which i been.
That before too because same that's the.
Way i talked about this a few times.
Before but that's literally one of the.
Main reasons like rusev asked was.
Because i allah we cannot afford a lot.
Of brands makeup so i lied about it and.
Then the brands will repost me i love.
That we live a market ballin on a budget.
Oh absolutely.
Uh-huh you know i can appreciate that hi.
Bam okay i'm ready to highlight we're.
Gonna use the classic james the full.
Sister highlight moment now we're gonna.
Use both of these yeah anasazi is so.
Hollywood and the tar chrome paint in a.
Top band alright let's take the classic.
All jokes aside and more p.m. five-10.
Brush every little sister spritz mm-hmm.
Anyway like you do it bam i feel like.
I'm doing a drag tutorial right now if.
You are okay so i'm gonna go ahead and.
Start my eyebrows now and these need to.
Be right pink which i am a floor full.
Scared okay so i'm gonna use the vivid.
Bright scream color those are unreal and.
Then probably mix it with a little bit.
Of druglord as well but we're gonna.
Fully start this transformation no james.
Did give me the iconic morphe palette.
The 35b.
Okay we got the 35b i've never really.
Used this one the last one if you.
Haven't heard of this i'm sure you have.
Because it's james here it is oh wow.
Full rainbow okay you definitely have a.
Thinner eyebrow than i do a little bit.
More of an arched brow yeah due to load.
Do it like a uh-huh here yeah and then.
All right now i'm gonna start painting.
Some blue oh look at that brush okay the.
Structure is getting there now have you.
Ever done a pink brow for fun no i've.
Done dry brows yes but not pink amazing.
Oh we have one more drama thing to talk.
About.
Okay wait ten more we actually ended up.
Squashing our beef oh my god you were.
Already yeah oh my god okay i was there.
Yeah didn't even know you're gonna be.
There no and in walks james and i was.
Like okay and i was like and the beef.
And like any drama had happened like.
Months ago and i was just in a different.
Place mentally and i was like okay you.
Know what like let's talk about it talk.
About it yeah me and james went outside.
On the patio for an hour while everyone.
Is drunk and smoking cigarettes come out.
Really and kay not really ooh and we.
Just talk about everything and it was.
Really nice we talk to each other like.
Normal people yeah you know with no one.
Else chiming in those energy can be.
Really overwhelming which a lot of.
People i'm sure you guys can understand.
After like just watching us but the one.
Thing that like is really common with a.
Lot of people in this industry is the.
Fakeness yeah and there's a lot of.
People who are very very two-faced and.
Are fake and despite the fact that i did.
Hate jeffrey for a long time because of.
Really stupid stuff i did always respect.
Him and always made a note of this one.
Talking about him as well that i not.
Only respected his ability to be blunt.
And honest but also has a business.
Mindset what's to talk about later but i.
Think the fact that we were able to just.
Sit down and just be face-to-face and.
Just own everything that we have both a.
Dozen barium.
It was important and it's something that.
Not a lot of people are able to do it.
Was really really cool i'm really.
Thankful we're able to do it because now.
Of course we're fine i think the problem.
Is you have people chime in your ear or.
You hear something online or someone.
Tells you what james maybe no it's nice.
To just go with a source like i have.
James's number we're really cool so if.
There's any ever a problem was like girl.
Someone said he maybe has said this and.
He's like oh just trying to make up some.
It never said that great have a hope.
It'll be a good day like it's so easy to.
Have a normal conversation and people.
Don't communicate i think in this.
Industry a lot yeah and it's not healthy.
That's not okay enough with the drama.
We've had it quite the journey but no.
Yeah we would have no issues for months.
And probably never again girl adults ok.
Sister james is testing me right here.
With this moment i love it.
I'm trying to conceal my pink eyebrows.
I'm scared oh wow i've even really.
Looked up yes now when someone says that.
Brows can only be sisters and not twins.
Can't relate because that's look pretty.
Identical honey they're still sisters.
Though have you ever done like crazy.
Look like this before no oh yeah this is.
The first i love that you're taking me.
Out of my comfort zone we're really just.
Going there and okay something that's.
Been on my mind is yeah i have seen a.
Lot of people come and go on this.
Industry right i'm gonna call myself an.
Og yeah yes and it's really cool to just.
Watch you from far away and see your.
Business sense because there's a lot of.
People that thank you you know and i.
Really appreciate and admire how you are.
About your business at such a young age.
Definitely something that a lot of.
People should look up to and admire.
Because you don't play around.
Thank you yeah oh my god hearing that.
From you honestly means the world.
I always said and you can ask anybody.
This i hate geoffrey but i think that.
The way you handle yourself although may.
Not be the most professional sometimes.
There's a reason you've been around for.
Ten years and are not falling off.
Anytime soon and i think that that's.
Something to really pay attention to oh.
That flushes wait - it does ha ha -.
Really pay attention to and sling that.
Has made me look up to you it's kind of.
A role model in the sense.
I've just seen so many kids that are my.
Age get into this and grow quickly and.
Then completely throw it away and just.
Make stupid decisions you know i've.
Always been thrown who's very calculated.
I love numbers i love statistics i love.
Always singles addicting it really is.
Honestly and i would so much rather be.
Focusing on that and being brainstorming.
With my team and seeing what can we.
Really do next to end everything up.
Rather than like going to a party or.
Like getting coffee yeah.
I just love it because you really remind.
Me of me at a younger age i think what i.
Really admire about how you're handling.
Things is like you're not overspending.
Like mine is rolling and but you're.
Being really responsible and i don't.
Know who taught you that whether it's.
Your parents and you can tell me in a.
Second yeah.
But it's cool that you're not just being.
Wild because i've seen so many people.
Come and go in this industry they start.
Making money and they literally spend at.
All i think it's gonna it's just like.
Yeah every month it's like forever and.
It's like you know it's good to treat.
Yourself like i love you treat yourself.
Once in a while yeah but you're not.
Being crazy and like irresponsible right.
Which at your age i can't believe you're.
Not being amazing.
Once again i've seen so many people do.
It and i think that's part of the reason.
Why i'm not also like with my family i.
Didn't grow up poor per se but we.
Definitely didn't have any extra money.
At all yeah and i'm mom and dad honestly.
Did a really great job of lying to me my.
Brother about it and trying to just.
Provide for us in any way that they.
Possibly could to make us happy which.
Still to this day means so much so.
Basically you come along you're saying.
Like they didn't really tell you the.
Financials just rip right guys out right.
From being a child ed you know has.
Experienced those moment it's cool.
Because i didn't get that so i'm gonna.
Share some not it's not dark it's just.
You know it's a sick childhood stuff so.
My mom definitely did not know any of.
That stuff she had bad credit she was in.
Debt when i was young and there was.
Constant like money problems that were.
Always stressing us out no it's cool.
That your parents didn't let you guys.
Feel that stress yes i remember.
Definitely feeling a lot of that stress.
I'm very just thankful for the way that.
I was raised with that in the sense that.
I did always save my money and i've.
Always been very very like versed in the.
Technology and like social media area.
Even yeah a must before like had a.
Business where i would make stuffed.
Animals of the girl in my school.
Instagram accounts in the twitter house.
I got bored and didn't want to do it.
Anymore i would just sell it or just.
Move on.
I met a person where i like to go big or.
Go home and every project that i'm.
Working on and if i'm not feeling.
Inspired anymore i'm like i'm out yeah.
And i'm not gonna waste i'd housing that.
I don't care about and when i first.
Started doing makeup my mom was like oh.
We were gonna get bored of this in 20.
Minutes yeah we're not buying you these.
Lights we're not buying you this makeup.
You're gonna get bored in 20 minutes.
Surprisingly i'm still here after almost.
Three years of doing a thai fans because.
Now that thankfully i have been able to.
Grow in the beauty space i'm constantly.
Challenged with new things and i'm able.
To kind of keep growing creatively was.
Just really awesome.
I like how you were honest last year and.
You were like look.
Like i don't want to be someone that.
Just does little bronzy tutorials and.
Reviews like this doesn't get me off.
Yeah and i love how you were just honest.
About that like i don't want to be just.
A review channel and no tea no shade.
Because like review channels are awesome.
When i go to review channels when new.
Products be exactly yeah today we're.
Still consumers as well yeah and i look.
To my peers especially taught to eat but.
Abused to see if something that's really.
Really good in a lot of other channels.
As well so nothing against them but for.
Me person tin spire me to sit down and.
Do that type of stuff i love overview.
Yeah where i get to just be really.
Really yeah time it just bring in from.
You too like i said use the same.
Products every video oh my god i didn't.
Know yeah i didn't know most like.
Followers or that i use the same stuff.
In every single video a very very rarely.
Like i think my most recent addition was.
The k'kaw highlighting powder but other.
Than that nothing has been added in - at.
All.
So for me to sit down even oh yeah guys.
This concealer is really really good.
Everyone's like no it's not yeah.
Absolutely liya so for me i only do.
Reviews if i like know that it's gonna.
Be like a good video and like bacon.

Part i just try to keep myself inspired.
Creatively because i know the second.
Thought i'm not inspired i'm out i.
Really love making they love this.
Community and i love my followers that i.
Have built so it's kind of like an.
Incentive for me to like not get bored.

Credit card last year for the first time.

Credit card bills get wiped in sleep in.
My account her my credit score should.
Technically be perfect but because this.
Is my first year credit it's not perfect.
Right when you get a house they averaged.
Together your last two years of income.
And of course this year with income i.
Made a lot of money and i've been saving.
All my money very wisely i'm really.
Making sure that i keep everything.
Because i have known that i wanted to my.
House but last year i made nothing okay.
Not nothing but i made very little.
Compared compared to this year of course.
And when those two numbers are outfits.
Together they're not good so clearly i'm.
Stuck in that situation but my best.
Friend's mother's was actually willing.
To co-sign on my mortgage with me for a.
House which is why insane yeah that's a.
Big thing yeah but and apparently to.
Have a cosigner you need three lines of.
Credit i don't even have one good line.
Of credit how would i ever have three.
Lines of credit on a house which is also.
So stupid because the point of a.
Cosigner is to adjust your credit yeah.
But like so now they're like being in a.
Little impulse so now they're being.
Impossible so it looks like i'm sister.
Stock but at this what i'm trying to.
Figure out anything that i can in five.
Years so now i hope to be moving on to.

Brought us closer together because yeah.
We didn't really help the best childhood.
Growing up and so many people thought.
That i was just using en for views on.
Our videos together which i mean i get.
It the videos do really well so like i.
Could see where you might think that but.
I'm like he's my brother and because we.
Didn't really have the brush childhood.
Together sorry i'm taking every possible.
Champion.
Spend time with me carry to the bond.
Yeah and it's in a really amazing strain.

When that happened he actually faced.
Coming in was so upset i was talking to.
You about it and i really had a sit him.
Down and be like listen you're gonna.
Lose a lot of friends right yes and it.
Sucks because you think that more people.
Would come and try to leech off you and.
Of course they will they will you're.
Also gonna get a lot of people that.
Don't really care for you and you.
Realize that they were only there for.
What you had to offer that yeah yeah.
Which is hurtful and you gotta let him.
Go it's well at least he has you to tell.
Him that yeah well i learned that the.
Hard way and i had so many people that i.
Was close friends with for years on end.
But i had to cut off for my own.
Well-being and same in the long run i'm.
Not thankful that i did but it sucked.
And i remember crying i thought to sleep.
So many times over it and wishing and.
Praying that it would be different that.
I could keep those people in my life but.
At the end of the day i now don't miss.
Any of them and it sucks to think like.
That.
And they gotta be you know it's a grow.
Some people start to turn a different.
Way or they have a different mindset as.
You or things has changed and it's.

Fluffy brush like that's okay and kind.
Of jiggle it around a little bit got a.
Little bit messy and i took a white.
Cream shadow i'm gonna kind of grab it.
On here we'd have to add a little bit.
More dimension so that's gonna be like.
What kind of looks like stars oh see i.
Was afraid that was too much okay well.
No cuz if you go over the law it kind of.
Balances it out there especially if you.

About like the solution mean how is ever.

Been someone who's kind of like the.
Cockroach video g does not die me and.
Shane dawson i've been doing this since.
Were too long yes for too long no kind.
Of rock your brain from being online for.
So long what do you think really.
Separates a creator from being like just.
A little fad - like a long lasting.
Person oh wow and do you have any advice.
For me to do that do you think yeah i.
Think you've already learned a lot at.
Your age you yeah i went through what.
Most people go through in like seven.
Years oh yeah in like one same with me.
Yeah like i addressed controversy years.
Ago and then it got bri brought up ten.
Years later so imagine like imagining.
You you're like twenty eight you're like.
Ten years later and someone's still.
Running a mouth.
You're like girl it's so far from who.
You are but it's the internet nothing.
Goes away right so my advice is really.
Just stay true to who you are which is.
Exactly what you're doing don't get.
Mixed up with any more both than people.
In our industry i think what's really.
Kept me let's say relevant and current i.
Mean it's been a long time right we're.
Talking from yeah.
Friendster to myspace to facebook to.
Instagram to youtube it's been a wild.
Journey and i've always been very.
Authentic and i've just always been.
Myself i know it sounds so like boring.
Almost or like bland but yeah i've just.
Never been a different person i've.
Always been me and i've always stuck up.
For what i believe in and i've always.
Been passionate about you know my.
Thoughts and feelings which i know a lot.
All though that we know but you just.
Gotta stick to doing you and i think.
That you're discovering yourself right.
Now as you get older and you're you're.
On the right path and no matter what.
Anyone says about you you are a hard.
Worker and i love watching your journey.
And i know people whether it's coachella.
Or something else people are always.
Gonna say something about you but you're.
You're doing it the right way and you're.
Being authentic and don't ever let.
Anyone take that away from you thank you.
What that's what i got to say that means.
The world even in the short time that.
I've been it's industry like alongside.
Of you i'll actually the change in you.
As well because like let's be real when.
I first joined you were very oh yeah.
Loud and it was there's a lot going on.

Wanted to text you and be like you are a.
Genius.
Stop talking yeah and i wish you would.
Have yeah i wish i would have to get.
Today why yeah let me tell you why i.
Wish you would have okay and i've never.
Said this out loud before is because a.
Lot of people that were around me were.
Making it worse it takes a real friend.
To be able to sit there and call you out.
On your bi yes yeah yeah and i didn't.
Have that really a lot of learning and.
That's okay you're never too young or.
Old to learn i'll tell you that.
Yeah well that's very much my.
Personality as well and like i've i'm.
Definitely blunt and i've definitely can.
Hold out for being a little rude or a.
Little starkie before to people but in.
The long run all like what i am that way.
Towards people have sleeve my close.
Friends yeah even though it may seem.
Real.
Harsh and kind of like aggressive in the.
Moment it takes a real us friend to be.
Able to say that with confidence know.
That this is coming from a place of love.
Not hate and not being angry to me i'm.
The same type of person like i want.
Someone to come to me and be like listen.
Sister love you the most.
You need to shut up you're being awful.
Right now i'm thankful for those people.
In my life and i want people to do that.
To me so i think that that's why i had.
The same nature to do that to other.
People cause like i wish i had somebody.
To stop me before i tweeted stupid.

Shape us as a person and it really.
Allows us to grow and become better but.
