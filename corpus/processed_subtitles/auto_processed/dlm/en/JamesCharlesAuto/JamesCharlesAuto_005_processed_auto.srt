My sisters james charles sturt and.
Welcome back to our youtube channel as.
You guys didn't see we're not in the.
Normal makeup studio and for today's.
Video we were doing a super super fine.
Makeup challenge.
I am literally so pumped for this but.
Also a little bit nervous i'm not gonna.
Lie if he makes ago i saw my good-ass.
Sister nikita dragon do video where she.
Got ready and sephora using all tests or.
Makeup and for today's i'm gonna.
Recreate that video by nikita but we're.
Gonna try to do it under 30 minutes.
I feel like 30 is a pretty good number.
For this video being that the average.
Person probably sends around 20 minutes.
On their everyday makeup routine and for.
A special event they may take a little.
Bit more time also for me my average.
Makeup routine takes me around two hours.
So 30 bits is definitely a huge major.
Challenge we also have to take into.
Consideration that every sephora is.
Different and the layouts are all.
Different so a lot of that time is.
Probably gonna be spent finding my.
Shades and finding the products in.
General i'm gonna be getting ready today.
Using all the makeup in sephora.
Including their spooky lighting and.
Mirrors but i did pick out a few things.
That i wanted to bring here from home.
Starting off with a damp beauty sponge.
To blend in my foundation.
I've brushes that i felt like i could.
Not do a makeup routine without being a.
Contour brush that i'm also gonna use.
For brush lush hello in powder a nose.
Contouring brush a a flat tub concealer.
Brush a highlighting brush and then a.
Pencil brush and finally i also grabbed.
A pair of lashes these are the new.
Bouncing bella's obviously being a.
Makeup source sephora does sell all the.
Items that i'm gonna be bringing with me.
Today but first of all that's kind of.
Really unsanitary i'm definitely not.
Trying to get any size or disease or.
Infections spooked and to all the.
Sampled makeup that we're gonna be using.
It's like out and open to the public to.
You but all these items are prepackaged.
And that folks is what we like to call.
Stealing and for me personally i'm.
Trying to get a house and a boyfriend.
Not a lawsuit and jail time without.
Further ado it let's call our uber by.
The way you can use code sister james.

Right now i have my damp beauty blender.
Still you guys know that is i talked.
About my tips and tricks to getting a.
Perfect scana when you're doing your.
Base makeup and the one trick that i.
Talked about was when you're shopping.
For a foundation you should always go.
Outside and look at your shade range.
With a mirror before you actually put it.
On and buy in a store because the.
Lighting in sephora is all obviously.
Fluorescent lights and outside lighting.
Is obviously where you want to make sure.
Your foundation really really matches.
But we did not have time for foundation.
Check today so i'm just gonna blend this.
In all over my face oh lord any more i.
Don't have enough coverage all i got.
Mascara can't forget to get in the neck.
If this foundation doesn't match it's.
Gonna be the one saving grace to hide it.
All the way down i am wearing a sister's.

Now that's white i'm scared okay for.
Baking.
Oh my god i'm topping things okay it's.
Time for brows.
And i'm very scared because i feel like.
If anything a brows are gonna be the.
Very very long process perfect benefit.
Purse it's my brown number 4 let's go.
Over here i can usually do my makeup.
Routine actually you know what maybe i.
Should use the goof proof brow pencil.
Instead okay.
Kratz op we're using the benefit.
Precisely or hollow benefit group we.
Don't even have my shade we're using the.
Benefit group ooh prep pencil number 5.
To snatch my brows up really quickly i.
Normally hate these shape of brow.
Pencils but it's much bigger and we.
Really don't have a lot of time left so.
I need to cover the most.
Brow's space in the short amount of time.
Possible disabilities and like normal.
Starting at the bottom of the brow using.
Light strokes and then going right in an.
Affiliate oh no you're kidding hello.
That's the worst eyebrows hours in about.
Our life what's going on i'm scared of.
The eyebrow okay you know what we do.
Have a concealer brush so we're gonna.
Clean it up in a second we'll see if we.
Can do this one a little better my brows.
Are by far my longest and also in my.
Least favorite parts i make appreciate.
It because it's to do the same thing.
Every single time like you never get to.
Spice it up or anything like think if i.
Can finish my eyebrows and have them.
Looking decent with a few minutes.
Remaining i will actually be golden for.
This challenge i can pop out of mascara.
And lashes and a lip pretty quickly but.
These brows may be my death wish oh my.
God this iros bad i feel like we can.
Read this work okay.
I don't know that finish this anymore.
What time we are left.
Well nars is over here no it's not her.
Is here where is the nars kind of we.
Just saw i this is a joke.
Where thanks thanks carl.
Where's the concealer oh right here okay.
Great want any more of that and we're.
Gonna use this to clean up our brows.
Let's grab the brow kit right here we.
Have our flat top concealer brush okay.
Okay okay okay not not a thought we can.
Do that you can do that you guys that is.
A decent sense of round let's be real.
Could be a little better but it.
Definitely could be a whole lot worse.
Let's pull in that concealer down to my.
Eyelid because what i'm use that as an.
Eyeshadow primer i definitely do how.
Time for eyeshadow look today but i.
Think we should go for a wing.
Can use my fingers to blow us houses i.
Didn't bring up one day brush i feel.
Like at this point we're not even gonna.
Get a line around so let's just get.
Right to mascara i know.
Benefit roller lash okay let's go over.
Here benefit were a little ashes on my.
All-time favorite mascaras for literally.
The longest time i stand by this it's a.
Really really bomb mascara using mascara.
From sephora testers is probably one of.
The worst ideas ever in the entire row.
Because i use are so easy here to.
Transfer you guys know i've already.
Legally blind so i can't wait to wake up.
Tomorrow with a stye but you know what.
We've gotta make do with what we have so.
Just gonna pop this on i'm gonna keep my.
Mascara right here we have the losses.
And it lips to do still so let's see if.
You can do this i have my lashes right.
Here and my last glue right here let's.
See oh my god i don't have to be first.
Oh my god that is not okay you're.
Kidding me i'll clean that up oh my god.
I can't even put lashes on width.
Squeezers let alone without this is a.
Joe be careful without sticking stuff on.
The floor oh you're kidding me don't get.
Up and fix that okay blood stuff hook.
Those up we're gonna do this one right.
Here.
That's the worst lip application i've.
Ever done in my entire life setting.
Spray we need to lock into place oh my.
God we my beak looks evaluate actually.
Let's evaluate as i clean up the floor.
Hold on let's see what we can do here we.
Love a humble sister this was so much.
Harder than i expected.
Like i was saying going into all the.
Products that i usually need are all.
Over the place in every different.
Sephora whereas in my neural maker.
Pretend i have everything right down in.
Front of me i think majority of this.
Challenge is actually spent with me.
Running around sephora not being able to.
Make decisions on what products they.
Wanted to use or where i wanted to use.
Them and not really took away from a lot.
Of the time doing my actual makeup i.
Feel like the primary foundation.
Application were really fine but we've.
Definitely lost it at concealer you guys.
Know that my go-to is always the charge.
Tape tape which i don't actually carry.
Out sephora and i have not used the.
Different concealer than that and.
Literally it's been a good like year i.
Think now i think it was definitely.
Little bit shook when i had to use a.
Lesser coverage concealer and i think.
From that moment on we were just screwed.
Miss laura mercier she was a smarter.
Sister because she didn't stock up a.
Single oh.
Hooray stock dustin you played me real.
Good with a cow well now there's powder.
Here but beforehand.
There was no miss laura mercier so i did.
Not get to set my face today wow i love.
When that happened hurts and then we.
Moved on to of course contouring of.
Course we had the kat von d and light.
Palette you guys know that is my.
All-time favorite and then baking once.
Again we had no chances of sending.
Powders and we had to end up going with.
Rubber fx powder which i've never.
Actually used it for let's see how she.
Looks.
Oh not that bad okay it went on very.
Very white and was definitely sticking.
On my face white as well so i was a.
Little bit spooked not gonna lie that it.
Wasn't gonna work out but i think my.
Face actually looks really really good.
The lashes are there but i wouldn't.
Necessarily call them on i don't believe.
In a good pair of tweezers for la chop.
Location so definitely not the best and.
Then of course we did we had a few.
Seconds up to put on our lipstick i went.
With just a tart liquid lipstick i hate.
That's color but it'll be the first.
Thing that i grabbed with me looks fine.
At this challenge i think was a success.
I finished everything in time my face.
Doesn't look the best but from far away.
And a little bit of phase two i feel.
Like we could definitely power for a.
Full on event ready glam.
Maybe alright you guys we just got home.
From sephora and not complete says get.
Ready with me in sephora using all.
Tested makeup at under 30 minute.
Challenge we need a better name for that.
Asap i had so much fun filming this.
Challenge today you guys an overall even.
Though my face doesn't look as perfect.
As i usually like it too i'm definitely.
Really happy with the results and i.
Think that that answers the burning.
Question that we've all been wondering.
Is it possible to get fully ready in.
Sephora yes i think it really is of.
Course i did bring a few tools but you.
Know we're just being a sanitarium.
Sisters just a quick little sister just.
Claim her as well at the end of all my.
Challenge videos i always say baby i.
Showed this one at home make sure to.
Shoot me a picture and let me know how.
Wetmore for this one please do not try.
To duplicate this one we did talk to the.
Manager staff a sephora beforehand and.
Made sure not only was it okay to fill.
In there but also do this challenge in.
General they were kind enough to let us.
Do this but that's only because they.
Knew who i was i shop there all the time.
And i know that i was a beauty guru.
Filming this for a youtube video lets me.
Straight up and real we have all brought.
Products before especially from.
Drugstore where you can't actually try.
It out and we've put it on and.
Literally loved the worst so i think.
That the fact they were able to try out.
Products in sephora before actually.
Buying them is such an incredibly.
Helpful system that makes makeup.
Shopping so much easier and although.
This challenge is very very fun to film.
For you guys please do not do this.
Because at the end of the day it's very.
Much taking advantage of sephora and i.
Don't want to do that to them if there's.
An emergency situation definitely go in.
For a good impression sister glam.
Touch-up the staff is all amazing and.
Will definitely help you look at the.
Beautiful and fabulous but anything more.
You're doing that at your own risk.
You do not hear this from me oh papa.
Being said guys i really hope you.
Enjoyed this little challenge today and.
