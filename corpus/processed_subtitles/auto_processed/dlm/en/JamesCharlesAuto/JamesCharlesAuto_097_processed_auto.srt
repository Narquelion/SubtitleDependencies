Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel so as.
You guys know i did recently switch over.
To doing three videos a week which is.
Such a fun challenge for me it is truly.
So much more work than i was.
Anticipating but i'm absolutely loving.
Making all these videos for you guys and.
I really hope you are enjoying them as.
Well speaking of making a lot of videos.
For the past week videos they've all.
Been a super super makeup and glam.
Oriented i mean i even jumped in a.
Freaking pool with the full face of.
Makeup on to show you guys that.
Waterproof makeup is possible definitely.
Check that video out if you have not.
Already but for today's video i wanted.
To just sit down throw on some likely.
I'm adjusting a little bit more personal.
With you guys a few videos ago i did a.
More personal q&a where i insert a lot.
Of questions that you guys wanted to.
Know about being an influencer or being.
A beauty guru and just kind of questions.
In general that nobody really really.
Likes to answer or give the honest truth.
To i don't actually think i answer any.
Other questions in the actual video.
Oopsies.
But i know i did get a ton of questions.
About pr packages getting free makeup.
For brands what that entails is that.
Sponsored yada yada yada so for today's.
Video i thought i would unbox a bunch of.
Pr package that i've been saving for the.
Last few weeks it's been like three.
Weeks since i've actually unboxed any.
New products i've been dying to get my.
Hands on these and do some swatches so.
Without further ado let's show you guys.
Some of the free makeup that i get on a.
Daily basis.
Music.
The first tiger to open is for my babes.
Over at benefit cosmetics and i'm so.
Frickin excited to open this because i.
Just love benefits so much and they're.
Pr packages are literally always so.
Adorable if you guys follow me on sap.
I've done a few unboxings over there and.
They're always so well thought out and.
Put together they have by far one of the.
Strongest pr teams of any brand i know.
So definitely a major left to benefit.
And you didn't hear this from me but you.
May want to keep your eyes peeled for.
Something with james and benefit coming.
Through so in the box comes a little.
Curl that says sister james enjoy the.
New goodies xoxo a sister stephanie and.
Any year we have a    official makeup.
So i guess this might be their new.
Porefessional line i think there are.
Three of them and they come in one two.
And three if you can see that on the top.
I guess one three two in this case but.
These are the pore fessional pore.
Minimizing makeup and i guess this is a.
3-step system so the back it says makeup.
To minimize the appearance of pores you.
All know sister james could definitely.
Use some help in that area and it says.
Covers imperfections without calling in.
Pores and that is step one step two.
Smooth and reduces the look of pore.
And step three instantly modifies and.
Controls access service for eight hours.
Okay that's a big claim i'm so confused.
Oh press oh okay so number three is.
Obviously a liquid i have no idea what.
Numbers 1 & 2 are but i definitely want.
To find out because like i said it's.
Sister james definite need some help in.
The pour department that is for sure so.
If you guys want to see me try these out.
Soon definitely let me know all right so.
Our next talk is just from sister lilly.
Ghalichi over at lilly lashes i'm so.
Excited for this hopefully there are.
Some miami's in here because my sister.
Is running a real low okay we have a.
Little card that says james on it and.
Then oh they're all miami's oh my god.
That is really what i needed the card.
Says hi my gorgeous sister james these.
Brands are really not on top we wanted.
To top you off with some of your.
Favorite letters and of course it's a.
Miami steak lamb xxl lilly and the lily.
Lashes team true sisters thank you so.
Much to the lilly lashes team i was.
Definitely running low and miami's and.
Lord knows at this point i am probably.
Gonna be buried wearing a pair of these.
So definitely needed to restock all so i.
Reached out to lily because i wear these.
Lashes all the time as you guys know and.
I get so many questions every time i.
Wear them as well so the other lee.
Lashes in the style mink miami and as.
Well you can now use cochise for 10% off.
Your purchase of all lashes it lately.
Lashes so definitely check these out.
They're by far my favorite pair already.
Since this next package is definitely a.
Pretty pretty big one and this one is.
From toe.
So inside comes this beautiful box which.
My dumb ass accidentally just ripped but.
It was beautiful about 30 seconds ago.
All right so this is actually my first.
Ever pr package from tasha you guys know.
I'd like to be very very unbiased when.
It comes to this stuff but i will say i.
Am very very very excited to open this.
I've heard that their skin care stuff is.
So good and you guys know that i don't.
Really do skincare and i definitely been.
Wanting to start it so this is a perfect.
Excuse to do so and let's open this up.
And it comes as cardon it says oh my.
Gosh sisters.
I love that all these brands know me so.
Well that says oh my gosh sister's brand.
New face drops for our fave rise and.
Glow james charles oh my god.
Also in the box comes this really really.
Beautiful container which looks like it.
Is a mask yes it is the violet sea or.
Radiance mask and by the name of us.
Doing it as a brightening mask for sure.
This looks so good i'm gonna open up.
Because i wonder if it's actually a.
Violet oh it is oh wow that is so pretty.
Definitely we try this out.
Very very student thank you so much.
Hotcha for the package and yoli glow you.
Better hit me up soon sister all right.
So this next package is once again a.
Pretty pretty big one and it's also very.
Very heavy too i don't recognize the.
Name on this box so i have no idea what.
This is or how they got my address in.
The first place let's go ahead and open.
This up what is this the first thing i.
See is this pamphlet that has a.
Marijuana leaf on it and now i'm.
Horrified is this literally a pr package.
Of drugs telling this doesn't look like.
The most illegal medicine that has ever.
Been sent in the mail are you kidding.
This has cbd syrup all natural hemp wait.
A second you guys know sister james does.
Not do drugs or drink i'm a good boy but.
If i'm remembering correctly from last.
Year's science class i'm pretty sure.
That hemp is like in weed is this.
Literally a package of marijuana okay at.
This point i am convinced and also.
Horrified that i may have just received.
A package of illegal substances to my.
Apartment so i'm going to read this.
Pamphlet now all the way through and see.
What the tea is because this is not what.
I want.
This cloud9 syrup is the number one.
Selling hemp ocf infused with pure hemp.
Cbd and nine all-natural herbs.
It's legal and okay that's what i needed.
To hear it's legal and safe to use with.
Positive health benefits that support.
Increase in happiness temporary relief.
As well as many ailments extreme.
Relaxation as well as amazing flavors.
That you mix with your favorite drinks.
That you'll love our kid of an idol that.
Sounds like cannabis we're back to the.
Weed thing okay so what i'm gathering.
Here is that these substances are legal.
Which is wonderful that means i won't be.
Doing my makeup from the jail cell thank.
God i'm still not exactly hundred.
Percent sure what these actually are i'm.
Just gonna go ahead and put this box.
Away you guys think whatever services.
You want in your body but swisher james.
Gonna stay clean all right so this next.
Package is from our sisters over anasazi.
At beverly hills and i think i know what.
This is and i'm so excited to open this.
Up all right so this is the box that.
Comes inside of the box and their.
Packaging is always so beautiful so.
Sleek and just super super modern and.
Simplistic and i love that yes oh my god.
It is what i thought and is they're.
Brand new.
Anasazi liquid glow illuminators i am so.
Excited for these so it looks like these.
Liquid glow illuminators come in four.
Different shades being called perla.
Oyster bronze and peach phase and i have.
Been waiting for these for so long.
Following the anasazi snaps an instagram.
Page they looked a little reso bob on.
All the promo pictures and you guys know.
That their illuminator in so hollywood.
Is by far my favorite highlighter ever.
I'm wearing it today as always so honest.
All day it definitely does not play.
Right when it comes to that glow let's.
Go ahead and test one of these out.
Looking at the little color things on.
The top it's looking like peach face.
Would probably be the best match for a.
James charles skin tone highlight so.
Let's pop her out of the box oh my god.
This is actually huge too for a liquid.
Highlighter it's 0.628 fluid ounces.
Which is literally almost the same size.
As most foundations that's really crazy.
I'm gonna squeeze a little bit of peach.
Fuzz onto like my hand oh wow oh wow you.
Can literally see just me moving my hand.
I'm looking at the monitor right now.
Against the light these are so metallic.
And beautiful i am.
Shook to the core this is like blinding.
Next-level highway right now the formula.
Feels really really nice it's definitely.
Like a very very creamy consistency and.
Not too liquidy as well which is.
Wonderful that means it's not going to.
Move around on the face i mean i love a.
Good highlighter but we're not trying to.
Do the full face of highlander challenge.
Every day so i definitely am a little.
Bit concerned though being that this is.
One of the lighter shades of the.
Collection and as you can see when the.
Light isn't hitting it it definitely.
Leaves a pretty pretty dark reflection.
So i'm very curious to see how that'll.
Actually look on my skin i will.
Definitely try those out very very soon.
So let me know if you guys want to see a.
Video with those alright so last but.
Certainly not least we have this package.
From our sisters over at makeup forever.
And just like with benefit makeup.
Forever it is one of those companies.
That truly does have such an amazing pr.
Team they really do care about their.
Customers and their influencers which is.
So amazing and is like the best quality.
A brand can have but all personal bias.
Aside let's get to the makeup oh my god.
If this is what i think it is this is.
Something very very very special so.
There's a little card inside that says.
We asked six of our friends to make the.
Perfect artist face color palette so.
Here's how they made their show us how.
You make yours probably makeup forever.
Oh my god so not only do we have sister.
Kim who created her little trio but we.
Also have sister cassie so if i'm.
Reading this correctly all six.
Influences created a trio of a bronzer a.
Blush and a high.
And cassie says i love about the.
Versatility of my artists face color.
Trio palette can be applied with a.
Subtle touch for a super soft flame or.
Kicked up a notch for a little more.
Intensity love that all three shades.
Conveniently fit in a small compact.
Pallet perfect for a vanity fave or.
Chucked in a small makeup bag for.
On-the-go i'm obsessed with h 102 highly.
Asked one one six sculpt and beep 208.
Blush and i hope you love them just as.
Much as i do.
Major hard core cheesy moment right here.
By him soul beyond pronto sister cassie.
She's by far one of the most talented.
Makeup artists that i know if you guys.
Don't already follow her you need to go.
Check her out and i cannot believe i'm.
Looking at her beautiful face on this pr.
Package and just let you know i may or.
Might not have taken this photo so the.
Package came with the nine different.
Products being three highlighters three.
Contours and three blushes and these are.
The three that sister cassie paired.
Together but i'm not actually gonna open.
Them up because i definitely do want to.
Use them soon but these colors are.
Beautiful and i cannot wait to put them.
On my face all right sisters so that has.
All the pr packages we have to open.
