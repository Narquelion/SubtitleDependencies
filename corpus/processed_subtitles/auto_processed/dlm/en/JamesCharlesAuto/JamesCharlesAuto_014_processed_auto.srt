Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel.
Before we jump into today's a brand new.
Video we are not going to notice that.
This finger now but what we are going to.
Notice i said that that i am wearing a.
Maroon at sister's hoodie the color that.
You guys have been asking for for.
Literally over a year now and i am so.
Excited to say it is finally here for.
The fall season this hoodie and along.
With the original taupe hoodie that was.
Oh this stain is not included this will.
Not come on yours i promise to buddies.
Are finally up and live on sisters -.
Apparel calm right now for you guys to.
Go a shop okay all of the video i'm just.
Gonna jump right into this video because.
You guys have obviously already seen the.
Title and the thumbnail were adopting a.
Puppy and i am so beyond pumped it's not.
Even funny oh my god we've been thinking.
About this and planning this for.
Literally almost idea now i almost.
Actually adopted during a christmas time.
Of last year but with the palette coming.
Out i knew i was gonna be traveling up.
So much and i really wanted to wait for.
My a kind of life and work schedule to.
Calm down a little bit to make sure that.
I was able to give at the right amount.
Of love and attention to a popper.
Joining the family and we finally have a.
Few quiet months and it is the absolute.
Perfect time to start looking at.
Shelters and try to adopt a new member.
Into the family i've already been.
Through raising and training a puppy.
Once it is quite the challenge but i am.
So excited and ready to do it again and.
Have him be a long time a family member.
And a best friend here in the sister.
Household and hopefully you guys will.
Want to come along on the journey with.
Us.
Burgundy spending the next few days.
Going to a bunch of shelters all over.
The los angeles area and a few different.
Adoption specials going on to see if we.
Can find perfect pupper take them home.
With us and if you guys wanna join us on.
That journey keep on watching.
Music.
Originating your hair at the los angeles.
County animal care center about to go.
Look at some of the puffers we're on the.
Way upstate earlier this morning and we.
Called and they do have a few different.
Pups that we were very very interested.
In and that could have an amazing home.
With us at the house so we're going to.
Go and make the stop and hopefully get.
To play with them a little bit obviously.
We're gonna go in and see the dogs and.
We want to make sure that we have a.
Really good at connection and at the.
Puppies like us and trust us and that we.
Like them and wanna cuddle indeed best.
Friends so hopefully we end up taking.
Your dog home today but if not obviously.
Want to wait for the absolute perfect.
Match that'll be for us but who knows he.
Could be right here in the shelter and.
I'm some fitted to go see so all the.
Puppies that are actually all the same.
And then i think that one's tiny where.
That one's tight we'll see i warned.
Stick those in hershey.
Yeah big momma we call all don's mommies.
No id why we started with our dog yeah.
And like oh your other people call their.
Dogs but your 20 stefan calls his dog.
Vomit yeah.
We have no idea where they started from.
But.
I don't know why i'm really feeling this.
Alright you guys see this - oh the.
Little poppers and i think that we have.
A four or five we're gonna play with.
We're not exactly sure because i know.
One of them did just get spayed or.
Neutered so you might be in the clinic.
And then also one of them says that.
They're not gonna be available until.
Literally midnight on the 13th which is.
In 8 hours from now so fingers crossed -.
And let us get a chance to play with the.
Little peppers but every teacher.
He really wants to pee everywhere.
He's an acrobatic seth is not interested.
In you don't worry a lot of people are.
In no all right you guys so we're.
Currently on the way home from the.
Shelter and unfortunately we are coming.
Home empty-handed like i said that we.
Are not an idea brush we want to make.
Sure we find the perfect match for our.
Family oh wow.
Okay so the three-year-old of life.
Pitbull that we had a chance to play.
With really wanted no part of us at all.
Let's be honest what definitely did hurt.
Because he was so cute and cuddly in his.
Kennel but when it came to actually mind.
Exploring he literally just wanted no.
Part of us which is totally fine.
Obviously the vibe has to be right and.
He was three years old as well which.
There's nothing wrong with he so wanted.
To give it a shot but we would prefer to.
Raise a puppy from puppy to dog and as.
Well we did ask about the other puppies.
That i thought i had a special.
Connection we have like snickers and.
Zuma and hershey's you just have to say.
His name that was emma and i firstly we.
Were not even able to play with those.
Puppies because they already had people.
That were said to about them and a long.
Waiting list of people just in case that.
Adoption person didn't work out so all i.
Can wish is that those homeys go to a.
Really really amazing home when they do.
Get adopted and like i said we are in no.
Rush it is really about finding the.
Perfect pump to come home with us and we.
Wanna make sure it's a good vibe we have.
About an hour-and-a-half drive home and.
On the way home we're just going to do a.
Little bit more research into some local.
Shelters hopefully ones that aren't and.
One half to two hours away we have.
Pretty much today tomorrow a on the.
Whole weekend dedicated to our puppy.
Search so who knows what'll happen in.
Tomorrow.
Good morning sisters hi hello james here.
It is saturday morning so few days after.
Our first vlog footage clips and.
Illuminae are currently on the way to.
Tomorrow because every single weekend.
The world knew that we were i guess this.
Weekend yes it was a sarcastic okay well.
I love waving you on and then going.
Anyways i people do not know how to.
Drive in los angeles but we've been - no.
Ii know that's a cupcake truck.
Thank you all right you guys we're back.
In the car again and pets murr was a.
Bust.
They're supposed to be having this like.
Major adoption event all weekend long.
But there was literally only four dogs.
So you might try to check out a few.
Other pet smart locations today i did.
Tell some my close friends that we were.
Planning on adopting a puffer into the.
Family and i'm super super pumped.
Because i just got a call from one of.
That lover and so depends who are.
Waiting for the other ones to get there.
Saying that their neighbor's dog gave.
Birth a few weeks ago to a litter of.
Puppies and they are ready to go up for.
Adoption.
They are not a breeder family they just.
Literally want to find a good homes for.
Them because they cannot take care of.
All of them and we're gonna see if they.
Have time for us to go see them today.
This literally could be perfect i'm so.
Excited right now i'm trying not to get.
My hopes up just in case so you're there.
See you guys and other adoption of it or.
At their house all right you guys i have.
A little bit of an update we weren't.
Really having much luck out the actual.
Shelters when it comes to hobbies so.
Getting a call from my family who just.
Wanted to find good homes for these pups.
Was like literally the absolute best.
Case scenario and so we drove over and.
They asked us not to come in the house.
Which we obviously respected because we.
Just played with the whole litter for.
Like a good two hour trying to figure.
Out which one we absolutely liked best.
And this angel right here come running.
Back to us we actually had up treats for.
Him and we were trying to teach him how.
To sit and it seemed like he picked it.
Up really really quickly as well so.
You're a smart little pup i get to go to.
That store and pick up a collar and a.
Good food and the kennel and a whole.
Bunch of things but.
He's perfect.
That's the angle i want i want to see.
Him on this video and let us know.
Whatever dog you think he looks for him.
He does have all the shots as well thank.
God we do have to get them spayed or.
Neutered but hi buddy a little chicken.
Chop from our heart is pretty much fault.
We got a collar a leash dog food treats.
Bulls and peppy pubs a little scene or.
Remover in case he decides to make a.
Mess some a few little choice we can.
Shove a little peanut butter in there so.
It has no nice snacks some first stuff.
Because he is already shutting quite a.
Lot so nice dog brush the crates lots of.
Things we have a bargain food already.
From the family that we adopted him from.
But they do not actually sell the exact.
Type of food here if you order that from.
Amazon the second week at home pressure.
I can sponsor but hash tag really please.
Should be but i think that's everything.
So little puppy is in the and we're.
Gonna check out and ahead home and let.
Him stay house the first time.
Music.
Music.
That's auggie's me-byo in so bringing.
This up and because he needs to have a.
Second water it is just a suicide look.
At the little trot oh that's a good trot.
Oh let's go outside you won't go.
Anywhere unless both of us are good boy.
Scent scent.
Okay.
Good boy that's so good the first time.
You went to the bathroom in this house.
Was completely outside oh yeah i think.
He's done with stairs for now that was.
Not a that was not a dog park that was a.
Human park that was you probably smells.
Worse.
We've already noticed he starts crying.
As soon as either one of us were inside.
Okay.
Music.
All right ii know you go to stay outside.
Booty you had to get trained he's gonna.
Be inside for the first few weeks but we.
Have to train him as quickly as possible.
I deal with this a lot when we were.
Growing up with training my dog i'll.
Need to do is just bring him outside and.
Make sure that he learned to pee outside.
Instead and we can just clean it up.
Carpets can be replace the wall puppies.
However it cannot be so it's fine oh are.
You still so cute like the amazing.
Youtuber than i am but the puppy is his.
First official meal with us we gave him.
Like a cup and a few little extra.
Kibbles of food and then a little bit of.
Warm water this one's nice and bushy on.
His teeth and he literally ran i went up.
To the bolt and sort of eating which is.
Amazing it year she just a little part.
Up and his bear over there for a good.
Like alimony and louise came out the.
House we have some folks that my.
Oversight that little poplar get to meet.
But the first time and i think it's.
Going on so you're basing somewhere he's.
Loving the house.
Music.
Okay guys it is the first night with our.
Popper and he is downstairs in the crate.
And he is oh this breaks my heart but.
Crate training is so so so important we.
Are almost the time but of course we.
Teach i will have had to go to meetings.
And total day it's most important that.
He is crate trained and protected and.
Feels like his crate is like his safe.
Place whenever we are not here obviously.
Right now it's like very scary for him.
But once you get to sleep it's all right.
So we cave and we brought him upstairs.
Basically what's crazy is every time.
Either me or luis i get within his eye.
Sight he stops crying which is like.
Really crazy he's definitely already.
Attached which is incredible but the.
Last thing that i want to do is like.
Create separation anxiety for him on the.
First day especially so we were keeping.
Him definitely in the crate for the.
Night but he's here he can see us.
He's still being a grumpy and quite.
Every few seconds but it's definitely.
Not nearly as bad with the holy instant.
Music.
Oh you guys we were on a date to it with.
The pepper we just got home off to a.
Little while he was in the crate and he.
Is literally solo with all the training.
And behavior so far he has not gone to.
The bathroom once and his crate which is.
Made me so happy he's only gone to the.
Bathroom twice in the house like i said.
Excuse me oh that's my entire arm oh he.
Is teething clearly as you can see we.
Did get him a bone and he's been tight.
With that but when the bone is not.
Renewable on earth which is not.
Acceptable he's doing it really really.
Well where the potty trainer he wins.
Anyone's well side which we will.
Obviously teach who knew about that but.
For now if they cease notify.
I don't think he's potty-trained because.
He's definitely not but like he's doing.
Really really well that's still my.
Finger we were actually loving him we.
Were hovering some friends over tonight.
To meet him for the first time and we're.
About to feed him some dinner so it's.
Really good so far.
