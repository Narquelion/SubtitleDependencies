Go i'm so pumped tell you guys about.
Today's app for a new video a few weeks.
Ago on my youtube channel i uploaded a.
Video called a makeup artist tries dry.
If you have not yet checked it out make.
Sure to click right up here but.
Basically i shared with you guys the one.
Art form that actually got me started.
Into makeup in the first place which was.
Not makeup and was drying with charcoal.
And one of the top comments that i saw a.
Lot over and over again on the video is.
That instead of drawing with charcoal i.
Should actually try drawing with makeup.
What a lot of you guys may not know is.
That that artwork actually already.
Exists and they're called face charts i.
Wasn't exactly able to find information.
On the origin or invention of face.
Charts but i do know that they are.
Popularized by one of the biggest beauty.
Brands in the entire world known for.
Their artistry not cosmetics based.
Charts are basically outlines of faces.
Printed on a very very special type of.
Paper for makeup artists are able to.
Play with different makeup books that.
Before they actually put them on a model.
For the runway because of the fact that.
These charts are flat and are basically.
A blank canvas there are endless.
Possibilities of different looks and.
Designs that people can make and whether.
It be for a runway or for instagram a.
Lot of devore artists had actually taken.
Face sharding to the next level and i've.
Been able to make careers out of them.
22 and cons the mua are two.
Different artists that come to mind that.
Had built majority of their following.
Off the beautiful face charts and a lot.
Of different influencers like myself.
Have recreated on they're very different.
Youtube channels and instagram feeds.
Y'all know me i always got to be a.
Little bit extra so i got made custom.
Printed sister jeff skiles face hurts.
I've never done this before by do you.
Think it'll be very very fun so without.
Further ado i have ollie makeup laid out.
Here in front of me i'm so excited to.
Jump into this don't forget to watch.
Until the very end for a very special.
Contest of regarding these patients and.
Let's get glam on paper.
Music.
All right you guys we were all set up.
And ready to go we have the regular.
Camera angle that you guys are used to.
Seeing and we also have this good and.
Fun and fresh camera angle right down.
Here i think i want to do the papers.
Make up in the same order that i would.
Do with my makeup starting off with this.
Skin so obviously i can't use foundation.
I can only use powder so how's the.
Anasazi a contour book which is little.
Been sitting on my shelf for the longest.
Time looks like a display item has dust.
On it sorry but i think this would be a.
Really good to use it for today's video.
Being that it is literally a book of a.
Million different color powders hello.
Okay so sorry y'all i'm just gonna grab.
My i guess i'm just gonna like put it on.
There i don't really even know i'm so.
Excited okay.
I woulda got my mac a regular powder.
Foundation and just put this on there i.
Think i'm just gonna lay down a light.
Layer of skin because i think i want to.
Make my skin tone slightly darker than.
What it normally is.
No scandals please it's also been this.
Weird thing where if you rub it in too.
Hard the paper leak starts to get.
Splotchy oh my god this is challenging.
Hello okay i guess this looks.
Interesting.
Music.
This is hard okay i'm gonna start.
Contouring hmm i'm gonna take the change.
Fawn which is like a very famous anasazi.
A contour color it is a cool tone brown.
Shade and start shading the sides.
Well my cheekbone is like here oh that.
Kinda looks good tea okay same thing on.
The other side just need to make myself.
Look at the sisters smashed how do.
People do this and like make it look.
Real that's what i'm like what hello.
That's a harsh oh mmm kind of looks.
Pretty though i mean i guess it's kind.
Of looks good you did with some contour.
Underneath the lamp because i have lots.
Of filler i wonder how they get us feel.
Like don't go outside of the lines.
What's a good third grade question but.
It applies we need to control the nose.
Ohh oh my god fun i'm gonna grab my tiny.
Little nose contouring brush and really.
You know just snatch it good do you see.
How pants that is hello gonna bring it.
Up here into the brow region cuz there's.
Gonna be contours there later on with.
Eyeshadow then i'm gonna blend that out.
Oh my god guys this is a kind of turn.
About low-key good so far oh my god i'm.
Excited i love being artists we're gonna.
Have to actually like sketch out my nose.
This is hard how do i do that ask ohio.
Oh that's the scariest nose contour ever.
Seen in my entire life okay i'm cupid.
Small all right this looks like okay did.
I get say.
Well that rhymes haha i wonder if using.
A beauty blender and like dipping into.
The actual powder and placing about that.
Way will actually like make a difference.
No well actually yeah kind of.
No definitely okay oh wow imogene s.
Literally using a white eyeshadow.
Currently to highlight my face so that's.
Good oh my god this is the tea this.
Looks so good oh my god that is so.
Pretty.
I'm literally okay yeah all excited i.
Figured it out.
I've cracked the code oh my god now this.
Is a person ah wow i snapped okay great.
I'm kind of like happy with this so far.
Low key the lowest of keys we're gonna.
Start on the eyebrows so for the eye.
Region of the brown region i'm gonna be.
Using the morphia 39a palette this is.
The palette that i level before last.
Year for holiday season and in its back.
In stock don't forget to use coach jeans.
For 10% off of course i'm gonna grab the.
Mac brow marker and the shame that.
Spiked and you got to kind of sketch out.
The outline of the brow first okay there.
We go that looks done to you.
Oh my god t-this actually looks kind of.
Good okay literally i had a guide to.
Work with on paper and somehow eyebrows.
Are still and not even how did that even.
Happen.
I don't deserve this okay so i'm gonna.
Start this auction looking i think i.
Wanted to like a sunset smokey eye a.
Moment with a pop of blue which is.
Perfect for the 38 palette so i'm first.
Gonna start by grabbing an orange shade.
And my m4 33 usko chance for 10% off and.
I guess let's just like put it on there.
Okay faint blending it out for real one.
Oh my god i literally love this next.
Tune to grab a red shade oh so pretty.
Hello why did that one go on so easy and.
The other ones didn't what.
Oh my god this looks so pretty hello.
This is literally so fun i'm obsessed.
With this oh good this looks oh so now.
I'm gonna add in a little pop of blue on.
The eyelid what should actually be.
Pretty easy i'm just gonna start by.
Carving the kind of navy show you know.
From the palette and give me a little.
Bit of a sister spread since it is a.
Metallic shade and popping that kind of.
Right.
That looks bad that looks gross oh it.
Sounds better.
Thank god i was sister spooped for a.
Second there now we're gonna go into the.
Eyes and lashes and not even gonna lie i.
Am a little bit kind of really nervous.
For this just because of the fact that.
I'm really really not good at drawing.
Lashes i struggle with this and a.
Portraits and obviously i'm going to.
Struggle with it here so i'm first gonna.
Start by just shading in the eyeball.
With a light brown color i guess i'm.
Just gonna use my regular liner to try.
To draw in eyelashes and pray that it.
Looks somewhat okay that's an ugly loss.
No oh okay i'm going to join the bottom.
Lashes.
That's like okay it could be worse but.
It's like not bad and add in the.
Highlights of the eye.
Oh my god that actually made it look.
Real tea.
All right you guys i think that is i.
Number one all done i'm not gonna go.
Touch up but i have another eye to do.
Off-camera and that took me quite a long.
Time so i'm gonna go ahead and try as.
Hard as i possibly can to get them.
Symmetrical and i'll be right back to.
Finish off the rest of the look all.
Right you guys we are back in both eyes.
Are all complete and actually loving how.
This is turning out so far this is.
Definitely hard like i expected it to be.
But i don't like getting the hang of.
Things a little bit more this is.
Definitely art form that takes a lot of.
Practice and a whole lot of.
Concentration and charl and error as.
Well now that we have both eyes all.
Complete we are actually pretty close to.
Done.
I accidentally may have done majority of.
The nose off camera because i forgot.
That i was not recording oops so that.
Only leaves us with kind of like the.
Cheeks and the lips left to go so i'm.
Gonna grab the mac blush and the shaded.
Peaches you guys know that's my all-time.
Favorite i'm just gonna use like a flap.
Hocking foundation brush and really step.
On there pretty uh oh my god this is so.
Pretty yeah.
James shaw was getting excited over a.
Piece of paper heard 30 minutes straight.
I really snapped north on her lips i'm.
Gonna go ahead and apply the shade at.
Kylie liquid lipstick in the shade of.
One wish i really hope that you can like.
Put this on there.
Oh my god why is my bottle left in this.
Photo so big she's a beefy car all too.
Much stupider is this me having a.
Revelation no it's very normal-sized so.
I'm gonna outline the inside now and you.
Just kept saying that my little teeth.
That always show through okay now i'm.
Gonna use the anasazi look with lipstick.
In the shade and milkshake and use this.
To kind of highlight the like center.
Portion of the lips to like make it look.
Actually 3d or not stupid okay so i'm.
Pretty much on at this point but the one.
Thing that i'm like not loving how it.
Looks is the nose contour because it's.
Hard um so i'm gonna add some fake.
Freckles to distract from my lack of.
Contouring ability and then i'm just.
Gonna use that mac brow pencil or brown.
Marker thing and drawing some freckles i.
Music.
Think it's time to show your sisters.
That the finish i faced her please take.
It easy on me this is only my first try.
And probably my last for a while but.
Okay t on camera doc she looks really.
Good.
Hello whoa it looks the best.
Wait i'm so proud of this okay let's.
Spell the team overall i'm really proud.
Of how this turned out that i'm actually.
Really really happy with it too but.
Starting off i was really not thinking.
Too positively because this isn't really.
Really hard i definitely picked up on.
The fact that with this paper you.
Definitely need to scan in at the actual.
Product that you're using specifically.
The foundation powders that i was using.
To kind of lay down the base early on it.
Because blending really is not the tea.
And it actually just ends up picking up.
The powder from the paper i really.
Really love how the brows and eyes.
Turned out i feel like this is very very.
Similar to how my face would look if i.
Had this look on which of course was the.
Goal with this i do wish the lashes were.
A little bit better i said in the.
Beginning going into it that i didn't.
Think they were gonna be that good and.
If they definitely could look a whole.
Lot more realistic i probably should.
Have used a little bit of a lighter.
Lighter and lighter pressure because.
They look a little bit chunky not gonna.
Lie but the eyes definitely happy with.
That's where the nose and fake freckles.
Definitely not my strong that part of.
This t-shirt i will say that the.
Freckles did end up looking a little bit.
Better once i kind of layered over a.
Face powder and a little bit.
More kind of blush color to make the.
Ferals look sunkissed like i normally do.
On my makeup but they do look a little.
Bit more intense and shading and nose no.
Matter what medium you're using whether.
It be a makeup or charcoal like you guys.
Saw in the last video is really really.
Hard and it's definitely not my strong.
Suit.
Oh laughs probably not least the lips.
Are not good all that being said though.
That is my face hair all complete.
I love how it turned out but this video.
Is not yet complete because like i told.
