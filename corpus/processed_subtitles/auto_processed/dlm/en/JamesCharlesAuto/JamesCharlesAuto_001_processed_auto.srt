Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel so if.
You guys follow me on snapchat which if.
You don't you definitely should you see.
That i posted a few days ago about.
Redoing my entire camera setup i.
Actually did snap that i wasn't gonna be.
Posting at all this week because i'm in.
The middle of redoing everything from.
Lighting camera lenses graphics and.
Everything on this channel i am so.
Excited now they have so many cool.
Things and ideas and concepts in the.
Works and you guys will be seeing them.
Very very soon but people were like oh.
Just film james we don't care and i know.
You guys are always so supportive which.
Means the world to me.
So you know i set my booty down and.
We're gonna film today so if you check.
Your calendar it is officially august.
Which is absolutely horrifying because.
Summer is coming to a screeching halt.
And you know it comes at the end of.
Summer school as many of you guys know i.
Did graduate early and i don't plan on.
Attending college so thank the lord and.
Heaven above i will not be attending.
School this year but i know so many of.
You will and i myself did for 17 very.
Very long years so for today's to do i.
Sat down and we're gonna film a.
Back-to-school quick and easy makeup.
Tutorial.
Almost all the products i have in front.
Of me today are drugstore for those of.
You who are on a budget i feel you girl.
Makeup can be super expensive when i was.
In school four years ago lord knows i.
Did not have 42 dollars spent on a new.
Foundation that was going towards a new.
Textbook school is also super.
Time-consuming as well i know i had so.
00 or.
00 a.m. editing videos they're working.
On a test or a paper or a project that i.
Had to wake up an hour later and get to.
School so this video is also gonna be a.
Little bit of a challenge for anywhere.
Like i want to do this makeup look as.
Quickly as i possibly can i was gonna.
Limit myself to ten minutes but knowing.
Me let's be real instead of take a.
Little bit longer so i'm just gonna do.
This pretty pretty quickly this is gonna.
Be a super easy light makeup routine.
That you guys can use when you were.
Waking up li ten minutes before your bus.
Gets here because we've all had those.
Days with all that being said good.
Morning sisters i hope you guys enjoy.
Your day in hell i mean school today and.
Without further ado let's get started on.
This super easy everyday school makeup.
Routine.
Music.
All right sir i already went ahead and.
Prep my scan it by a showering of course.
In the morning don't want to be stinky.
For school and then i probably face.
Using my favorite moisturizer for.
Foundation today i'm gonna use the brand.
New covergirl healthy elixir foundation.
And i'm gonna mix a shade 725 and 745.
Then of course i'm just gonna bounce.
This into my skin at using my damp.
Beauty blender all that needs to not.
Happen so this foundation is definitely.
A light to medium coverage foundation it.
Is definitely not full coverage glam.
Which is great though we definitely.
Don't need to be rocking a full coverage.
Hd foundation stick to high school it's.
Really not that serious we don't have.
Anybody to impress so don't worry about.
It you can see my face today i'm using.
The maybelline fit me concealer in the.
Shade light if there's one thing that we.
Do definitely wanna focus on it is.
Probably gonna be concealer just make.
Sure we really hide any blemishes or.
Under-eye bags because i'm like i said.
We are definitely gonna be a very very.
Late working on papers and projects and.
Not getting very much sleep in school.
I've been there before so let's do.
Everything we can to fix it and once.
Again just having my beauty blender and.
I'm gonna pounce it into place school.
Could definitely be super super.
Stressful as well and we have all woken.
Up with symbols before and stress.
Breakout so if you do get one never fear.
Don't worry just grab your favorite.
Concealer just put it over your pimple.
Just destroy this bit and then instead.
Of using a beauty blender i'm actually.
Gonna grab a very really light fluffy.
Brush and instead of a pouncing aunt i'm.
Just going to lightly tap over the area.
And just blend out those edges by doing.
This we're keeping the concealer exactly.
Where you want it to be right over the.
Pimple obviously so it's hidden and then.
Just blending out those edges so it.
Looks natural because that my face in.
Place today are gonna be using the cody.
Or some powder you guys know i.
Definitely have a very very interesting.
History with this one but it wasn't.
Oldie but a goodie for the longest time.
So i'm gonna try her again today.
Hopefully she won't do be dirty i'm just.
Gonna grab a little bit of powder really.
Lightly on my r-13 brush from morphe and.
Just set my under eyes in place that.
Understood my ar0 brush once again for.
More free to set the rest my face.
I know murphy's obviously not a.
Drugstore brand that is sold in like cvs.
Or walgreens or anything but their.
Products are super super cheap compared.
To a lot of their competitors and they.
Are very very good as well and you guys.
Know you can use coach james for 10% off.
All their products to highlight and.
Bronze today i've got to go to my nyx.
Highlight and contour palette and my.
Morphe m 5 on 9 brush and i'm dip into.
This shade right up in here and i'm just.
Going to lightly.
To conquer my face because let's be real.
We definitely know how time to do both.
I'm next ender grab the same exact.
Murphy i'm a 509 brush that i used for.
The contour and i'm gonna dip into the.
Elf blush palette and i'm gonna use this.
Shade right up in this corner right here.
For just a little bit of orange pop of.
Color to the face just add a little bit.
Of life back in so next we're gonna.
Really quickly plate the brows today and.
For this i'm actually gonna using a not.
Drugstore product and i'm gonna be using.
The benefit persistent eyebrow pencil in.
The shade number three but i am using.

Wild mega glow in the shade golden.
Flower crown out of this entire makeup.
