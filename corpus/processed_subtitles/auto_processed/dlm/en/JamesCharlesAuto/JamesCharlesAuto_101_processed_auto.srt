Here and welcome back to my youtube.
Channel as you guys can see today i'm.
Done with a very special and iconic.
Guy hey everyone it's jojo welcome back.
To my youtube channel you guys.
I.
And my nightmare at the same time i have.
Been asking jojo to film a video with me.
For literally.
Almost two years now two years okay and.
We're gonna dive into that.
Too that's a lie i've been wanting to i.
Just haven't been wanting to do.
This okay that's fair i literally said i.
Want to.
But i just don't want to do that but now.
I'm like i'm comfortable we're gonna do.
It yeah.
For today's video i'm giving jojo a full.
On makeover no glitter no rhinestones.
Getting my makeup done number one is.
Just like a nose like.
I like to do it i don't let anybody else.
Do it it's just to know my hair.
Even more so i'm nervous too because i.
Want to make sure that the look is.
Appropriate.
This is gonna scar you for the next five.
Years there's literally so many things.
That i want to talk to you about today.
Your rise to fame you being an internet.
Superstar.
Thank you jojo and her bobo business.
Mobile okay i feel like people need to.
Understand how much of a genius.
That you actually are going on in there.
Jojo and i did make a business deal i.
Would get to give her a full.
Transformation.
In exchange she gave me a full.
Transformation into jojo on.
Her channel so make sure you guys go.
Check that out it's absolutely insane.
Thank you for.
Good business and if you guys want to.
See jojo in a full-on transformation a.
Full makeover keep on watching but this.
Is going to be so much fun you have to.
Trust me.
I trust you but before we jump into.
Today's transformation.
You obviously have quite a lot on right.
Now i do i went full jojo because i need.
To feel.
The most jojo's that way when i'm so not.
Like i'm no joke then like i'm good you.
Know.
Perfect well i think we should get you.
Changed get everything off so we can get.
Started on this makeover completely.
Fresh.
Okay okay here we go we'll be right back.
You guys.
All right you guys jojo and i are back.
She has no makeup on so jojo the first.
Thing that i want to ask you about.
Before this video is today before we.
Even get into all the exciting things.
That i want to ask you about.
Okay i texted you asking to collaborate.
On february 7th.
2019 and i said 2018.
Yes okay i want to do a video together.
So bad where i give you a full.
Transformation.
Yes and talk about how your business.
Will go all these things you literally.
Responded and i quote.
Hey sorry i can't do that i did well.
Okay.
At the time you have to think i was 15.
Yes that was.
A lot scarier to me because i was so.
Young.
You know well so like this is obviously.
Something very very different for you.
And we're doing this like full.
Transformation where i want to turn you.
Into.
Not an instagram body but a and just.
Like a glam.
We met in the middle i didn't want to be.
An instagram baddie but i understand.
But i also was like yeah let's do.
Something different like i get why you.
Wouldn't want to do.
A pink unicorn look because what's the.
Difference you know i feel like when i.
First.
Wanted to do the collaboration with you.
It was with good intentions like i.
Wanted to give you a full makeover but i.
Think.
At that time you know a big thing in the.
Internet is like a lot of people think.
You're like acting or this is like some.
Crazy character for you i.
Was even one of those people that made.
Me believe like okay maybe this is some.
Sort of like act like.
Let's go like the real jojo but like now.
I'm understanding like this is the.
Glitters the bows.
Everything it's all like so many people.
Do you think it's a character.
And like the reason why it works for me.
And like where my life is how it is is.
Because it's not a character you know.
And like i'm in charge you know at the.
End of the day like it really is me in.
Charge obviously i have nickelodeon and.
I'm a manager and i'm my mom but like.
They're all working.
Under me if that makes sense right like.
It's we everyone i work with like i.
Don't want to be like you're the boss or.
I'm the boss like i want to just like.
Figure it out together yeah no yeah.
That's very.
We are very much the same way here at my.
Team lovely there's little glitter.
Everywhere.
I know is there always glitter ever on.
You yes my house like if you walk.
Through my house your feet will just.
Turn glitter oh that's great.
It's insane but no i obviously like i.
Wanted to do a video with you always.
Like your james charles but i was like i.
Just i can't but i don't know what to do.
But i can't do it but i want to do it.
But i wanted it i don't know.
Well i think what opened back up the.
Conversation was honestly like when you.
Started posting your tech talks totally.
Because i feel like.
We've seen you in glitters and bows and.
Rhinestones for so long and that is.
Classic jojo.
I started to kind of explore yes and for.
Me like as a fan.
I was like oh my god this is so exciting.
And as a friend who would ask you to.
Collab i was like.
Oh she's giving the reveal that i wanted.
Makeup all the time my makeup is such a.
Huge part of my brand but like i.
Am in sweatpants at the end of each time.
Totally so i think it's so cool that.
You're like not afraid to show that.
Although for the.
Longest time i actually did sleep with a.
Bow and a side ponytail.
I don't anymore but like dance moms days.
Yeah every single night literally every.
Single night joe doe.
I would wake up and i would just.
Re-slick my hair oh yeah take my.
Hairline make them really receding.
So far back we're gonna put some good.
Contour to really bring it forward i.
Love it i want to ask you because i feel.
Like.
Dancehalls was my absolute favorite show.
Growing up i've seen every single.
Episode every single season i would.
Challenge you to a dance moms who knows.
More well considering were on the show i.
Think you'd probably wear.
Free when i was on the show oh that show.
Was literally my everything and i feel.
Like a lot of the girls that were on the.
Show.
No shade to anything because i love all.
Them don't like talking they don't like.
Talking about it yeah but i like that.
You still do.
Everybody can do whatever they want.
Totally of course i feel like the show.
Was literally your guys's childhood so.
Of course everyone like has a right to.
Do.
Whatever they want about it like is.
There a reason that you still do talk.
About it and like so openly.
You know at the end of the day dance.
Moms was our lives and it was a reality.
Tv show and it wasn't scripted.
But like at the same time like it was a.
Tv show you know and like.
Off camera like it was always so much.
Fun and for me i think i can just see.
Like past.
All the bad and like i don't want to.
Remember the bad memories you know you.
Always have a choice in life to look at.
The bright side of the dark side yes.
I think very much the same way totally.
And for me with dance i was like i just.
Try to remember like the fun memories.
And like hanging out with abby and.
Hanging out with the girls and hanging.
Out with the crew and doing school like.
Going to the competitions and being.
Stressed but then like the winning you.
Know it's like i.
Know that i would be nothing without.
Dance moms like it's where i started.
It's what got me my platform.
And so without it i'd be nowhere and so.
I was like you gotta remember where you.
Came from you know.
Always always come on cover girl no yeah.
Literally i don't remember i was gonna.
Say it's really cool to look at it that.
Way like i.
Obviously i like how the opportunity.
Working with covergirl i don't actively.
Do anything with them.
Anymore anymore but like i'm i'm so.
Great i would never talk bad about them.
Like they literally gave me the platform.
That i have today and like i'm so.
Grateful for that like i didn't know her.
Without covergirl so oops excuse me.
I've never actually put concealer on.
What i don't do it.
You're kidding no i'm giving it to you.
Gal so you were just speaking about how.
You always like to look at the positives.
And things and i.
Love that and i very much think the same.
Way how do you always stay.
So positive and so bubbly and like does.
That ever turn off especially when the.
Cameras are off no.
It never turns off the only thing that.
Happens is i'm not gonna.
I wouldn't say the word shy but like in.
Public i'm either.
Super extrovert or super introvert like.
I just like my group of people like i.
Don't like if i'm at like a party.
I'm so like in my little bubble but yeah.
I don't know i just like to stay really.
Positive.
I don't really have like a switch that.
Goes off it's just like kind of.
Whatever's in the moment.
Yeah i feel that it depends on where i'm.
Around but how i stay positive.
Is really my people around me i always.
Say like you have to have a good team.
Obviously because that's who you work.
With every day.
But you also have to good have good.
Friends you know and i i have i have.
Great friends.
And the best friends in the whole world.
I feel like we honestly have quite a lot.
Of like similarities just in terms of.
Our internet existences we both have.
Really loyal fan bases but i feel like a.
Lot of people outside of our fan bases.
Find us annoying.
Yeah oh yeah it's like it's a very huge.
Thing both been able to.
Make a joke out of our music totally.
Like stay positive and like.
Quarantine my fan base has completely.
Changed like for the better it's insane.
So it used to be like super young kids.
Which is amazing and incredible and i.
Love my little babies so much.
And now it's like still the young kids.
But it's also.
Like teenagers because of tick-tock they.
Realize like oh she's not fake and she's.
Not.
Crazy like she's a normal person it's.
Like a whole new group of people it's.
Awesome yeah yeah okay look forward.
Music.

Started making your videos i feel like.
There's a lot of videos going around.
Of the tour people being like oh my god.

These nice and rainbow colors.
We should use those we're actually not.
