Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to our youtube channel.
Today's video i'm so excited to bring.
You guys a brand new episode of beauty.
Battles those who of my favorite people.
On the planet the ones that gave birth.
To me sister mother charles and sister.
Father charles welcome to our channel.
Brother oh my god so my entire family.
Because they right now la and on my.
Channel i do a really awesome series.
Called beauty battles where i have two.
Different people both take one half of.
My face with all the same makeup.
Products and they are challenged to see.
Who is the better me way and being that.
These two people came together to give.
Birth to me i makeup guru i figured what.
Better way to test out who i really got.
The makeup knowledge from my dad or my.
Mom then have them do an episode of.
Beauty battles so that is exactly what.
We're gonna do today how do we feel.
About this are we excited excited i am.
Excited i'm a little nervous because.
Although i wear makeup every day your.
Father is a much better artist than i am.
Yeah so i was gonna say that too i think.
That the playing field is definitely.
Actually even in this situation at my.
Mom wears makeup every day and as the.
True sister she watches all my youtube.
Videos she's always the first person.
Text me every single time i upload be.
Like great for you you can't drink on.
Camera i didn't i definitely think she.
Has that makeup knowledge but my dad is.
Far more creative far more artsy i think.
Like we said this could be anybody's.
Game at this point.
Without further ado if you'd like to see.
My parents a battle to see who was the.
Better anyway and learned about me and.
My childhood and our crazy family keep.
On watching okay so for today's video i.
Picked this look out for you guys to try.
To recreate today it's really simple.
Sure i'm gonna take the tarte shape tape.
You're doing this first.
Applause.
So tutored assessors and i asked you.
Guys to send in questions for my parents.
Answer about me and my childhood and.
Growing up with me and sister ian so are.
You guys ready for a quick little q &.
Slay sure why are you pushing it you're.
Pushing his face i'm just holding my.
Thing gently and you're like i'm trying.
To would you keep moving it around the.
First question is from jenna and she.
Said huh see you guys.
How did y'all react when james wanted to.
Start doing makeup i just was confused.
At first because i've never seen boys.
Wear makeup so whatever my first thought.
Was that perhaps he was transgender.
Which would have been totally fine but.
That was a whole new unfamiliar area for.
Me and i was nervous for him and i was.
Nervous for myself because i knew things.
Would change but once we realized that.
James was comfortable with himself we.
Were comfortable with him and we were.
Very supportive and still are with what.
He's doing yeah for sure it was nothing.
Like a rough patch in our family and.
Everybody was kind of confused but i.
Kind of like try to explain to them as.
Best as i possibly could that i was.
Comfortable my gender identity i just.
Wanted to do this to kind of express.
Myself and of course like once i started.
Like gaining followers and getting.
Paychecks and stuff it became more of a.
Reality that like i wanted to do i was.
Like something serious other than just a.
Little hobby after school going back.
Even further though we asked what was.
Your guys's reaction to james being gay.
You're gay i don't know do you have the.
Better side or do i i'm not sure i got.
No better oh nicole asks how was the.
Family decision of james not going to.
College and if he did go what would you.
Have liked him to study architecture.
Interior design fashion design i think.
That would have been his forte actually.
The whole college thing happened rather.
Quickly in my mind he was.
I believe yes that he would have studied.
Something in the creative arts field and.
I was still determined that he was gonna.
Go to college up until the very last.
Second okay so i actually have a.
Follow-up question for you two i was in.
High school working really hard in doing.
Well on my grades but kind of last.
Second i kind of hit you guys with hey.
I'm graduating early and moving to.
California not going to college do you.
Have any advice as parents to any other.
Parents out there who may be watching.
With their kids about college and for.
Those kids who might not feel like.
College is the right path for them.
Obviously each individual each.
Circumstances obviously each person each.
Individual we're gonna be here okay i'm.
Glad i promise go ahead.
So obviously each individual is unique.
Each situation is unique we you answer a.
Smartypants.
If your son or daughter's got good.
Grades and they've been working hard and.
If they want to go to school let him go.
To school if they don't want to go to.
School you're in the dream for about 80.
Grand a year so what kind of from that.
Standard life on a budget by budgetary.
I'm asked what's the most embarrassing.
Thing sister james said as a child.
T-ball sitting at the second base line.
Braiding the second baseman's hair.
That's embarrassing.
She looks great gabriella looked amazing.
She did look great but we ran a t-ball.
Game priorities i didn't think the.
Baseball field or the infield was.
Exactly the place to be braiding.
Gabriella's hair that's what did it for.
Me that's what i knew something was a.
Little different well what do you think.
I do remember that situation i also it's.
So cute how you're like actually trying.
So hard for every question i think it's.
Cute that's why it's funny just be.
Natural you're doing fine.
Your egg looks good it's nowhere near as.
Dirty as mine.
I draw how is james are coming a big.
Influencer at pha mass changed her.
Guys's lives i think the major change is.
Him just not being with us all the time.
Because he's living in california but it.
Is very surreal for me when we are here.
Visiting him or when we were in new york.
City a couple months ago people.
Recognized him stopped him and want an.
Autograph or a picture and to me to us.
I'm sure he's just james and to the.
World he's james charles and it's kind.
Of cool to see that everybody just loves.
Him but yes it definitely is a little.
Scary a little scary as well so you guys.
Mention the last question helps.
Sometimes a little bit scarier for the.
World to kind of like know me so this.
Question comes from nicole and she asks.
Mama and father charles how do you guys.
Feel about the hate james gets for.
Anything as a fan it always makes me so.
Mad but i'd like to know how you feel.
It's it's terrible and because he's a.
New quote-unquote celebrity we are not.
Used to this and i do i admit that i do.
Read the comments and it just breaks my.
Heart that there's so many people that.
Are so honest.
People that are unique if you don't like.
What somebody does or what somebody.
Believes in then that's okay but don't.
Don't be mean don't be cruel and it just.
Breaks my heart people are for the most.
Part that's why i don't participate in.
Any of that online stuff because as a.
Father you only have a couple of.
Responsibilities in your life one main.
One is to make sure that your kids are.
Safe his safety has always been a.
Priority to me that's what scares the.
Hell out of me because just a lot of.
Time and that's always scared me school.
Bus i'm grateful for all his fans that.
Follow and protect him and support him.
Because it gives me strength to know.
That there's plenty of people out there.
That don't feel the way those selected.
Few do so i'll be so down this one is.
For you and in a lot of cases when it.
Comes to boys and beauty we.
Unfortunately see a lot of like horror.
Stories online about their fathers not.
Being supportive from sister kalina papa.
Charles what was it like building.
James's glam room and the basement i put.
A mirror up and some makeup lights and.
Tried to do the best i could to give him.
What he wanted his glam room used to be.
My office it was so i had to move out of.
My office pretty much which was no big.
Deal but that's what i do i build stuff.
So it was no problem i had fun that was.
I think a really cool experience to be.
Able to bond with my dad because we've.
Always been really close we boys built.
Stuff together but obviously like we.
Were talking about before makeup was.
Definitely a really rough patch for our.
Family when we kind of started off so.
That was a really awesome just.
Experience that we had together because.
It really showed that like they were.
Beginning to be way more supportive and.
Helped me in my career it was clearly.
Obvious that he was dedicating a lot of.
Time with a lot of energy to it and it.
Was gonna be something that he was going.
To pursue so it just made sense to take.
It to the next level and give him a.
Better area to work and a different.
Setup so that's what we tried to do next.
I'm going to use the morphe 35o palette.
For some color on the eyes use code.
James for tempers.
That's right it daddy's awfully.
Concerned about his shadow worry about.
Daddy shadow.
Karolina asked what was one thing you.
Didn't allow james to do it but he did.
It anyway.
Wear makeup to school i would have to.
Say everything eyeliner.
Oh god this goes on top of your eyes.
Right yeah i guess i don't have a steady.
Hand oh well that was pretty good i.
Think.

That you the color matrix on your little.
I thought that was extremely intense i.
Thought looks like my old yeah those.
Were some of my favorites when i was.
Younger and still had time to do a lot.
Of those creative looks i would go to.
