Hi kitty girls.
James charles here and welcome back to.
Our youtube channel as you can see under.
The day very special guest okay.
So for today's video we are doing a.
Wonderful idea.
After you nights ago meeting and we're.
Sitting and talking and just having a.
Good and fresh time like the sisters.
That we are and we were discussing our.
First ever collabs on youtube you're.
Talking about their first ever video.
That we did together on my channel the.
Introduction of sister yen which was him.
Doing my makeup and why not that that he.
Was brought up in discussion ian said i.
Could easily pick out your makeup.
Products and probably do a good job.
Because you know make a profession on.
That or just like you what exactly makes.
Me think that i would love to know me.
And we did that video did the woman i.
Did my own makeup i was you for a day.
I've said a lot of experience around.
Makeup now so you know so she's cocky.
You love a cocky sister really dale.
Honestly i will admit when he entered.
His own makeup for the life swap series.
He did do a a pretty decent job but.
Since the first video that we film every.
Single time i have picked out the.
Products for ian to use and put that.
Much knocked up in front of him every.
Single step taken care of and walked him.
Through the actual makeup application.
Process okay yes but i've had experience.
So i remembered the names and like what.
You need you think you're everything i.
Think i remember every product not like.
The brands and what type think i know.
What you need just don't know who well.
That's great it has first today's video.
I had the novel idea to have ian go to.
The makeup store with my credit card.
Puts already scary thought so yeah it's.
Gonna be picking out all of my makeup.
And then i'm going to have to use that.
Makeup and do it this video concept.
Really doesn't seem as exciting when you.
Really lay it down it's gonna be.
Exciting right now can you quickly list.
To me all of the staffs of the makeup.
Routine okay so we got foundation.
Concealer setting powder setting spray.
Nine order oh well no i want them in.
Order oh i don't know okay keep lying.
Foundation concealer setting powder.
Setting spray mascara eyelashes bronzer.
Eyeshadow.
Brow gel or pencil and lipstick just.
Because you have the stops down does not.
Mean that you know what products to get.
Or buy shades.
Oh yeah shea's another thing let me.
Guess more like kind of the same like.
Shades on the face so not really i'll go.
Like one thing lighter than what i think.
Works for me okay.
So i did like a color coordinated look -.
Yeah you should probably make sure it.
Looks nice together i have to worry okay.
I forgot to say tail hello i'm going to.
A really important event later on.

To figure out what he uses on the daily.
It's kind of nervous but i forget.
Something or not get the right shades or.
Products or brands the makeup products.
That i bond james he's gonna be using.
For tottie's event tonight so i have a.
Lot more pressure on me to get the right.
Products to make them look a sister.
Stash for tonight alright guys we just.
Got the ulta and i'll walk around and.
Try to find the products this place is.
Huge there's everything here so it's.
Gonna be difficult book let's go yeah.
We're gonna find foundation first.
Foundation where you at that's this.
Foundation primer we need primer too.
Don't we oh god maybe this thing is like.
A champagne.
What is this one this one's perfect yeah.
Let's get my brow pencil is there.
Different shades in these two oh my gosh.
Sure yeah i think he likes liquid.
Lipstick so this is nude kisses okay.
Yeah so we got this so far we got liquid.
Lipstick brow pencil foundation than a.
Primer we still need mascara eye shadow.
Powder and concealer what type of look.
Is he going for he didn't give me any.
Ideas he just said buy me makeup sorry.
So got the eye shadow i think he's gonna.
Want to use more like the pinkish tones.
It's a matching with the lipstick i'm.
Smart right now i really should have.
Looked at his makeup room before i came.
Here.
Cuz i don't know any brands that he uses.
I haven't even seen concealer anywhere i.
Know what it was urban decay settings.
Urban decay settings retinue it that's a.
Thing okay.
Tart shake cape where you at so i think.
Concealer has to be lighter than the.
Foundation to a certain extent if i'm.
Correct ban medium sand sounds about.
Right.
Soft light blend powder it's just hiding.
Powder i think yeah set in africa so we.
Got some setting powder from becca james.
I feel like i'm not getting the right.
Brands and they're gonna get mad at me.
But i'm sorry i'm trying my best here.
So mascara the lashes in a highlighter.
And i think we're done oh okay okay.
Mascara maybe he uses this brand burning.
It black no matter what's probably think.
Mascara matters that much especially.
He's gonna put lashes on so let me grab.
One of these ultra black pigments okay.
We got black mascara where is it lashes.
At i need some miami's i don't know what.
Brand that is but i need my eunice here.
All the washes i don't see miami's how.
Do you pick out good eyelashes i don't.
Know what friends are good i don't know.
They seem pretty cheap i honestly don't.
Know then these are good what about.
These.
To go with these he's looking about the.
Right length and james always cuts him.
Anyways these look good we got brow gel.
I think he needs this so i'm gonna throw.
That in there welcome james and its new.
Bronzer it shouldn't be this difficult.
What is this okay this is our.
Highlighter matches with the nation of.
The other stuff okay bronzer and i think.
We're did smells like peaches maybe.
James wants someone else ones like.
Peaches.
Now we're getting this two-faced.
Smells like peaches bam i think that is.
Everything i don't know how i did i know.
I got all the right products i don't.
Know about the brands or the colors or.
How well it's gonna work together but.
We'll see james good luck man okay guys.
I picked all the products and now i have.
Everything he needs but i don't think.
It's the right brands but i think he can.
Make it work james i tried my best man.
Hopefully you look good tonight how was.
I like knew what to get brands or what.
Shades to get so that was the challenge.
Wasn't like organized so i was like oh i.
Need foundation here's all the brands a.
Foundation we got sort of friends yes.
That's me i made it difficult oh my god.
What if makeup stores were organized.
Like my product.

Kind of a really good point actually.
Wow okay anyway how are you reveal them.
To me okay okay so we're gonna start it.

Really tasty good job thanks for.
Shopping buried today alright guys so.
You just left the house to do some more.
Assists are shopping for tonight's.
Festivities i have all just products.
Laid out here in front of me i am.
Nervous for this because i literally.
Don't use a single one of these products.
In my everyday makeup routine and also.
Disappointed because evil is very very.
Convinced that he knew every single.
Product that i used and it was honestly.
Getting a little bit excited and really.
Happy that he felt like he knew my.
Makeup routine but we are going to make.
It work and i appreciate him still.
Shopping in the first place it's the.
Thought that counts and i'm going to now.
Think that i have some sort of talent.
And i'm gonna make that thought count.
And make this look count because i have.
To get ready and i have to go so let's.
Do this if you've got a long time sister.
You would know that i used to use this.
Primer and literally every single video.
But when i would also talk about in.
Every single video was my foundation.
That's slipping off my nose and after a.
Literal year of trying to fix the.
Problem i realized that it was this.
Primer and the ingredients in it that.
Were causing my foundation to dissipate.
On my sister schnoz so that is why i.
Stopped using this a very very long time.
Ago but it's still a good primer so i'm.
Gonna put this on tonight and i am not.
Gonna put it on my nose i'm only gonna.
Focus this right here in the rankings.
That my pores are a little bit there so.
For foundation we're gonna be using the.
New benefit hello flawless foundation in.
The shade i'm so money honey.
Oh la vache marks that is very me i.
Don't enjoy the foundation these shade.
Rains and it launched with was the.
Sister sad it's just something that i.
Really like to pearl on this channel and.
Well benefit does have pretty good brow.
Products everything else is not good so.
I i just want to use that let's do a few.
Squirts and see how this looks okay.
Thank god.
Decent shade match thank you ian at.
Least for the you guys know i really.
Don't switch out my products that often.
But the one thing that i really don't.
Ever change.
Is it foundation i've talked about this.
Before but i use had really bad skin.
Young credit i'm still a little bit.
Self-conscious about it and always want.
My skin to look very very porcelain a.
Doll like using a new foundation is.
Always a little bit of a risky moment.
Because you never know the type of.
Coverage or how it's gonna wear or how.
It's gonna look throughout the day or.
How it's gonna photograph ideally.
Foundation is just really one of those.
Things that can totally make or break.
Your entire makeup look so i would just.
Rather not risk it.
But looks like ted risking yes that's.
Good where it's at right now i would not.
Choose to wear this again but keeping an.
Open mind i want to finish this look.
Before i make any comments next step.
Taric creaseless concealer i have not.
Tried this one yet because shape is my.
Hour late or die i know this one.
Just launched so let's try this out and.
See oh oh my god this is so thick like.
Me oh my god this concealer is also.
Yellow.
This concealer is pretty much the same.
Exact shade as my skintone it's just a.
Little bit more yellow that's a little.
Bit scary to me as someone who really.
Likes to have a lot of contrast in their.
Makeup i guess i'm just got a contour my.
Face a lot wait.
Oh my god ian forgot to get a contract.
Powder i'm going to be flat for the eye.
Hold on this is not good.
Dear lord and have it please let me not.
Look flat to this event tonight and.
Please don't let me take a flash photo.
And somebody will say on twitter and it.
Go viral and create another beam.
Actually please do do that i want to.
Release more roots and make more money.
Amen now to set this in place i'm gonna.
Be using the becca soft light blurring.
Powder i'm just gonna stop this and -.
This is so dark oh my god ian you're.
Giving me a racism scandal do i have to.
Put her to bed with this bonnet oh.
Bigger that's already five o'clock the.
Powder is occident i have never once.
Seen this in my entire life but of.
Course we're witnessing it right now.
When we go ahead so glad burt brenda.
From the apartment tours to be making a.
Comeback today.
You're literally kidding me next up is.
Going to be contouring but guess what we.
Don't have.
Contour maybe this can work as a contour.
Shade i'm gonna work out this this is.
Red oh my god my skin is bright yellow.
My contour is right and i am going to.
Die i'll give to take the peach blush.
From the middle of this palette and i'm.
Gonna pop it on for a real and use my.
Morphe floor brush these coach aims for.
10% off wish they had more via alpha.
They do have more fuel tie-in you didn't.
Get a single morphine product i can't.
Believe i'm contouring my face of the.
Mob i shadow right now.
What has my wave come to okay i'm going.
To grab a highlighting brush now this is.
The m of 501 and i'm going to open up.
The setting spray then i'm gonna dip.
Into the highlighting shade right here.
In the peach oh wait there's another.
Highlighter we have three highlighters.
Oh the becca one the free sample okay.
Let's do what the peach one mixed.
Together with becca opal gonna go the.
Benefit goof proof brow pencil you got.
The shade number 4 thank god that is a.
Shade that i actually do use oh my god.
They look so uneven i never been makeup.
Again this is fun a psi.
Wow now my brows are all filled in and.
Looking probably the worst they've ever.
Looked thank god for benefit gimme brow.
So we can set them in place and how they.
Last all night long.
Okay it's eyeshadow time we have these.
Shades we have two mats and one two and.
Six shimmers why i'm first gonna grab.
This mauve shade that i used to.
Literally contour my face okay.
Next in to grab an ab 507 brush and this.
Is where things are gonna get really.
Tricky because the only other option for.
A matte shade in this palette is this.
Dark brown why i do not know oh what my.
God i am now going to not panic and i'm.
Going to blend this out okay that looks.
Okay gonna grab the becca highlighter as.
Well on the same approach that i just.
Used to cut that i'm gonna wet it for a.
Real one and i'm gonna try it to attempt.
To fix this because i am now freaking.
Out and this is not funny anymore okay.
That helped great taking the rosy shade.
From the middle of the palette i'm gonna.
Place that next door next to get this.
Liner from buxom this is a metallic grey.
Brown liner it keeps getting worse and.
Worse.
What does this even look like it's.
Broken great that is what it looks like.
I am not using that liner because one.
It's broken and i'm julia sharpen it and.
Two it already looks bad enough and i.
Don't want to make it even worse so i'm.
Gonna fly to lancome mom's your big.
Mascara i think this one it's actually.
Okay i still have not try this but.
Fingers crossed we'll have one good.
Moment out of this entire look.
I am going to put on an eyelash these.
Are the islur at vegas night eyelashes.
And i will say that a good lash can.
Really save a lot usually when filming.
My videos it is a little bit of a bumpy.
Road to get to the final product am i.
Exaggerating my complaining a little bit.
Yes but is the end result.
Always redeemable and telling that i'm.
Proud of yes this is not that i don't.
Want to say this looks the worse and i.
Don't know how to fix it because i don't.
Have any product options to fix eyes.
Because of this challenge i am gonna go.
Do the other eye off-camera now because.
I'm running very late and i have to walk.
Out the door in a few short minutes and.
My face currently looks probably the.
Worst it's ever looked so i will be back.
In a few short madness to finish off the.
Rest of the luck thanks brb ok so we are.
Back and the other eye is looking.
Equally as bad so i'm going to take the.
Becca highlighter that yeah literally.
Did not even buy it happen to get for.
Free.
I don't going to reapply this for some.
Glow - hopefully distract and then we're.
Going to complete our look and that is.
The laura geller nude kisses lip hugging.
Lip gloss at least the lip matches the.
Eye.
Thank you lord jesus and heaven above oh.
My god.
And we're going to finish off this.
Amazing and lovely makeup look today.
That i am so happy with with the urban.
Decay all nighter d slick setting sprays.
Music.
Holy a little bit you think.
Eyelashes really big and wonky doesn't.
Work yeah face a little creased a little.
Crusty you can see through your pores.
Yeah do cat's eye brows a little big.
Lips a little crusty overall a pretty.
Awful job on my part.
The sad thing is too is that this.
Doesn't even look that bad on camera so.
All the comments are gonna be oh my god.
Damn stop complaining like do you look.
Fine it is currently 622 and there is a.
Car coming to get us for the event and.
Approximately eight minutes what i don't.
Know that.
Yeah you need to get ready tail and i.
Look like this so that is neither good.
Nor flash nor fine and i am really.
Scared we'll see first problem you did.
You should have started filming earlier.
So it didn't work out well he could have.
Done an actual look it made me so happy.
And so kaunas an older brother that you.
Were so confident in your i was calm.
Well i had trusted you to take out.
Things that i would wear i know i'm very.
