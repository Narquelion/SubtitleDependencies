Life what this foundation sells a.
Cleaning supply is kind of what's your.
Nationality why is i have so many things.
But i want to ask you and then i want to.
Talk to you about today what got you.
Started into my god and to make up or.
Into youtube makeup i guess my mom is.
Being such a beauty girl my mom has.
Always been obsessed with makeup and.
Fashion and hair and like she just hid.
Her vanity every single night before she.
Washed her face and played with her.
Makeup and i'm so burned watch her she.
Just vehicle i'm just teaching myself.
New techniques and she played makeup.
Like an hour every single night and then.
She wash her face and go to bed and so i.
Just watched her do it and i was like i.
Love this he's got interested in it.
But it's so cool and why did you start.
Youtube i started doing youtube because.
Everyone on instagram has asked me for.
After my instagram page started gaining.
Followers but i started doing makeup and.
Predominantly because of this right here.
Sitting next to me every single time you.
Say that i still don't believe you and i.
Think it's so cool yeah sort of all the.
Growth that you've had and being so.
Young and having this incredible success.
So quickly but you are still able to.
Like sit here and give credit to.
Somebody.
I think the humble of you and so cool of.
You because most people when they get to.
Like your stature they would not even.
Remember that and they would be like oh.
Well i did this on my.
You know what i'm saying and i think.
It's really cool like you still sit here.
To say that about me and that really.
Like it's very humbling for me and it.
Inspires me i remember literally being.
Like 11 12 13 not doing makeup yacht but.
Watching all the beauty tutorials and.
Like jacqueline was like the main one.
That i would always watch like when you.
Were sitting on your floor still working.
It back and the way i just number like.
Everything you'd put on your eyelids.
Because you have like the best eye shape.
Ever.
I literally really i need that product.
Right now i was like i don't even wear.
Makeup what am i doing when i did.
Surgery makeup eventually you were like.
The first beauty guru ever noticed me i.
Remember it vividly i remember actually.
Where i was sitting i was at my mom's.
House and i was having dinner with my.
Family and it was a sunday night like i.
Remember it perfectly and literally and.
I reached out to him and i was like you.
Are so incredibly talented like i just.
Stalked your page for the past 20.
Minutes straight i can't get over it.
Like i did a green eye like i remember.
That and tried my one that you did and i.
Was shocked by it i was just like oh my.

Owner of moorefield like you've got to.
Check this guy out and you've got to.
Start sending him pr and so she did and.
He freaked out he's like i'm crying.

Shoving his coat down your throat i'm.
Gonna spread my face with the morphe.
Preference that sprite use cote mister.
Can resolve a little bit i'm dry.
Encrusted you're gonna do that before.
You go on with your under eye yeah on a.
Real note though like you obviously have.
Been in the industry for a long time.
Doing makeup forever so you've seen a.
Lot of things change what would you say.
Has been like your favorite makeup trend.
That's like happened that it's like now.
A really big thing and what's like your.
Favorite makeup lift eve ever done oh my.
Gosh okay so as far as trend i would say.
When kim kardashian and mario posted.
That picture of all that yellow and her.
In her t-zone yeah i remember like that.
Was so iconic and there were articles.
Everywhere and everyone was like oh my.
Gosh what is this trend.
Dad was like my favorite moment and make.
A pissed sri as i've been around for as.
An adult like witness like firsthand.
Because that changed my makeup routine.
And it's something that we all utilize.
Now like we all put like light.
And light powder in the center of our.
Face to really bring like everything.
Forward and create that heart shape yep.
Like that ideal face shape if you will.
And that's all because of kim and mario.
Which is why no matter how much people.
Talk bad about kim i'm always like she's.
Shawn is really she's a legend when it.
Comes to this industry big time i'm.
Trying to think of my favorite makeup.
Look that i've done i can't even decide.
Let's just skip that and say it my.
Favorite look of yours you'd like a fire.
And ice look a long time ago okay so let.
Me ask you and do not even pretend like.
Be honest how long does it take you to.
Truly do your makeup like not just your.
Doing like a quick beat which what is a.
Quick beat just to be honest i probably.
Like a quick beat like get ready like i.
Would take like an hour but like give me.

A concept and like you will focus so.
Much on it and like put so much effort.

Intuition it's crazy like you really.

Gosh my eyebrows took up half of my face.
Eyebrows are so big and even realized.
How big they were back then it looks.

Contouring honestly i mean when you.
Don't have makeup on it looks the same.
But when you make the final little like.
You have a nose job yeah you gotten so.
Good at it i want you to do my makeup.
Give me a nose job and freckles speaking.
Of me doing your makeup obviously i.
Speedy guru is a weed or i'll make up.
All the time but occasionally i know you.

You say are like your favorite artist to.
Work with well nicole who was known as.

Excited.
Next to it just crawling i was like hi.

Brother right now because i do not like.
This thing i just don't like skinny.
Little ones i think i can't get the job.

Little one no we don't discriminate here.
On the channel i asked you this earlier.
Like no don't tell me cuz i wanted you.
To tell me on camera what is your sign.
Oh i'm a gemini are you water earth fire.
I don't know well i like some egg.
I like the ground that i stand on her.
Not to be in the air and i would prefer.
Also not to be burned but i love a good.
Campfire so i need to know now hey.
That's great my face idea isn't working.
Right now that's when you know that you.
Look alright.
Oh kinda i'm finally moving on to eyes.
Now i think the lord in heaven above.
Eighty seven years later enough my.
Eyebrows are finally even john we were.
Talking earlier how like you took a much.
Needed mental break for a while yes.
Yes as a close friend of you you didn't.
Need that very much so and now you're.
Kind of like slowly easing your weight.
Back into youtube when you obviously got.
On the platform for a very long time now.
Where do you think the industry and the.
Makeup communities kind of had it.
Because i feel like right now it's in a.
Little bit of like a rough moment it is.
It's hard for creators right now yeah.
It's way harder than it used to be and.
Like with all like the algorithm changes.
Like it's so different and it's so like.
Saturated now with so much content and.
So much incredible content and so many.
Incredible artists and like it's a lot.
To like be successful in this industry.
Now it was so much easier and so much.
More simple back in the day people used.
To just want makeup tutorials like.
That's all they wanted and they feel.
Like now so many people are like okay we.
Know how to do makeup now like we want.
More and they want like really.
Entertaining videos that have to do with.
Beauty and i think that's why your.
Channel is so incredibly successful.
Because you put so much effort into.
Doing that and it's very difficult to do.
The kind of videos did you do but you.
Make it happen.
Where is i feel like my followers if i.
Don't do like makeup tutorials they get.
Upset yeah we want the makeup because.
That's what i'm known for.
Yeah you know but i feel like that's.
Very rare like do you think you'll.
Forever do tutorials like do you want to.
Keep doing that well in that sense so.
Like you haven't here for a long time.
Your followers do love tutorials but do.
You think you wanna branch out more and.
They kind of join in with that like oh.
Absolutely.
I would definitely love to do like.
Different content.
Once my editor and videographer moves.
Down he moves down mid-july i definitely.
Wanna be like branch out cuz now i like.
Have someone to actually warn me and not.
Just a tripod the things can be totally.
Different and i have a lot of ideas yeah.
I'm really excited to actually branch.
Out and try new things for sure but i.
Can't wait for like the rebound.
Chocolate hell sister-sister sparkles.
It's such an easy one you still gonna i.
Literally blow my own thought i don't.
Mind me i go yeah i usually pull that.
Out i am that's what i'm doing it i'll.
Pull it out farther i definitely took.
This out a little bit far but you know.
What.
Okay i'm gonna put block in my waterline.

You know i absolutely hate doing it oh.
My god this is so dark and smoky and.
Spooky chuckling i feel you can blow.
He's seeing a little bit oh no i can't.
But i feel like i feel like hardy's.
Thinking like it because you will like.
Include some sense of it in the edges of.
Your video sometimes i think you could i.
Have a long power but i don't have a.
Good voice can you match pets.
I don't know i'm never tried like if i.

Positive note you inspired me as we were.
Talking earlier to like join this entity.
In the first place and you truly i feel.
Like have been such a pioneer and.
Someone who like for fronted the makeup.
On the internet revolution so this club.
Meant a lot to me and i have one.
Question for you would be what piece of.
Advice would you give to any young girls.
Or boys out there who want experiment.
With makeup or who may want to be like a.
Beauty influencer one day i would say as.
Far as advice to you know someone.
Wanting to get started in this industry.
Or just loving makeup girl or boy is to.
Honestly not be intimidated by all the.
Incredible artists out there because.
Especially now with how many amazing.
Artists aren't instagram like when i was.
Younger i didn't have social media to.
Run to like it was like the beauty.
Magazines and what you saw on tv and now.
It's like you just like turn on your.
Phone and it's everywhere and it's such.
An incredible makeup and then on top of.
Like the photo shop in the face tuning.
And some of it is so over the top and.
They're completely doing their their.
Makeup literally with photoshop and bass.
Tuned and it doesn't look like that at.
All in person so and to not be.
Intimidated by someone who has been.
Doing makeup for years you know like us.
When we started we all had moments of.
Absolute suckage i think even you like.
Starting off you were so incredible just.
Right out the gate and that's extremely.
Rare but still when i see you do looks.
Now compared to when you started on my.
Whoa oh my gosh luck marry we've all had.
Makeup i didn't realize how much better.
You could get like you're blending has.
Gotten better your contour has gotten.
Better your everything is gone better.
You know you know you were so incredible.
Just starting off i personally did not.
Start off great like i've always had a.
Knack for i've always loved it you know.
I was self-taught but like i used to be.
Very harsh literally a lot of harsh.
Lines i would just say to not be.
Intimidated by everybody else who has.
Been practicing for a long time and.
Working really hard at their artistry so.
Definitely not to be intimidated there.
Are so many talented artists out there.
And i'm always exerting for a new talent.
And for a new and upcoming artists that.
You can help out or support or like paul.
Or just like to check out and get.
Inspiration in general and one thing i.
See all the time are people who are so.
Incredibly talented but i often times.
See a lot of people that like have the.
Best talent but just complaining on.
Twitter all day long about them not.
Getting recognized or they're not making.
It are them not getting brand deals and.
Stuff you have to be focused on the.
Talent but what's really gonna get you.
To the top is your personality there was.
A moment on youtube where like everyone.
Was copying everyone like whoever was.
Getting views everybody was trying to.
Act like that person just being yourself.
Don't think that you have to like overdo.
It because someone who is getting tons.
Of views is acting that way.
You know just honest to god being.
Yourself no matter what that looks like.
Don't know if you think that you're.
Weird or you're different we've all felt.
That way and most people on youtube.
Actually ran to this as an outlet.
Because they weren't accepted and.
Because they felt weird and because they.
Felt different and then on camera me.
Personally i'm speaking for myself i.
Couldn't believe that so many people.
Loved me like i could not believe it so.
Many people that wanted to hang out with.
Me and actually liked me and still to.
This day when i do mean greets and.
Thousands of people show up i'm always.
That what for me no matter how famous.
Anybody gets it's always the same.
Feeling every time it's always like the.
Whoa you never really said yeah so yeah.
Just be confident in yourself and just.
Be you no matter what i'm literally.
Gonna drench myself it's like you have.
No idea i'm so ready make sure you guys.
