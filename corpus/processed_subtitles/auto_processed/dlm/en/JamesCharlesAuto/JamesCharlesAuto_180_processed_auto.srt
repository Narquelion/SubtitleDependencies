Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel as we.
All know instagram was one of the.
Biggest social media apps in the entire.
World obviously though i've been using.
Instagram way more than normal recently.
Because of their new filters now when.
Instagram first released arrays i feel.
Like not many people really care about.
That because the filters on there.
Weren't that great at all so we had all.
Had snapped out for the last like.
Several several years snapchat gave us.
The dog filter the skin soothing filter.
And also the flower crown filter i mean.
Truly what else more could you really.
Need well apparently the answer to that.
Is quite a lot because recently.
Instagram but took the crown out of the.
Ability for users on the app to actually.
Submit their own face filters and oh my.
God it was quite the game-changer over.
The last few months there have been a.
Ton of filters to go a very very viral.
On instagram because of how cute they.
Are.
And i found myself wanting to open up my.
Stories to take selfies literally all.
The time so for today's video i thought.
It'd be a really cool challenge to try.
To create instagram filters in real life.
Using makeup like this one this one and.
This one so if you guys want to see how.
I created these looks keep on watching.
Music.
All right you guys something right into.
Today's video as you can see i already.
Pretty much have my entire base are that.
Most of these filters are based on like.
Either eyeshadow looks or just different.
Art things on the base they're going to.
Add on top of this but if you do want to.
See how i created this base make sure.
You like right up here and check out my.
New updated makeup routine i've been.
Using a lot of new products and a lot of.
Techniques and i go super in-depth so.
Make sure you guys check that out if you.
Want to get to this stage before we.
Actually throw on the filters out of all.
The filters that i've seen recently one.
Of my favorite ones to use myself is.
This one which is called a blue.
Butterflies by a girl as you guys can.
See it smooth out the skin add some full.
Crackles and also some cute little blue.
Butterflies at different places on the.
Face and it makes the lips a little bit.
More plump so i'm going to try to.
Recreate this one using makeup the first.
Thing that we're gonna do for this.
Makeup look is to add on some faux up.
Freckles so i'm just gonna take a tiny.
Little liner brush so this is the m25.
0-0 and a little bit of a brow powder.
And just add on some cute little dots.
I've done a few different videos on fake.
Freckles before on my channel but just.
To recap i'm using it different varying.
Pressures all throughout some of the.
Freckles are a little bit more pigmented.
And some look like they are more.
Underneath the skin it'd be more natural.
Obviously better then it's going to top.
Anything in as well fake freckles are my.
Favourite steps to do in any makeup.
Routine and they look so cute but i will.
Say they are pretty challenging to do it.
Definitely takes quite a lot of practice.
To get them to look real and natural so.
It's all about different techniques and.
Seeing what works best for your skin.
Tone and then just on top i'm gonna take.
A little fluffy brush and dip into that.
Same little brow shade a tub of any.
Excess product and then just kind of.
Lately like splotch this into what the.
Area this just adds back a little bit.
More dimension into it the freckles and.
Kind of gives them more like sunkissed.
Look now i'm going to zoom you guys in.
And we're gonna draw a butterfly all.
Right you guys so i took a photo myself.
With this filter which obviously is okay.
But i just went ahead and zoom to end so.
That way i'm able to kind of use the own.
Filter as a reference when it comes to.
Drawing this on so i'm just gonna first.
Start off with a tiny little brush and i.
Guess try butterfly so the first one.
It's like on the cheekbone like right.
Here so i'm scared okay.
Here making a little bit thicker at the.
Top and it is at the bottom usually for.
Me i prefer the opposite but.
Music.
That's a really bad joke sorry but i'm.
Gonna draw the two little wings oh no.
This might be a lot harder than i.
Thought it was guys oh oh okay and i'm.
Just gonna kinda mirror that on the.
Other side that looks so bad maybe if.
It's colored it won't look like as awful.
Now just gonna grab some liquid lipstick.
Colors on the back of my hand i'm going.
To start mixing together the different.
Tones for this butterfly and i'm just.
Gonna you know start filling this in and.
Really hope that it comes together.
Because right now it's not looking great.
First i'm mixing together a super light.
Sky-blue tone and i'm going to put that.
In the wings just like this the good.
Thing about like with up sticks too is.
That they do what dry down so i won't.
Have to set them with eyeshadow.
Hopefully i'm even gonna take a little.
Bit of white as well and put that at the.
Very very like edges of the wings to.
Hopefully make a little bit brighter.
Then i'm gonna use a deeper blue tone or.
That same little liner brush and put.
This towards the middle of the butterfly.
To create that like illusion of a shadow.
As if the wings are opening grabbing.
Even darker blue shade i'm just gonna.
Add a little bit more dimension into the.
Very inner parts and also connecting and.
Like that wing up just like that because.
It'll be a shadow in the middle okay.
That doesn't look that bad i didn't.
Think i wanted to set this with shadow.
But i honestly think i'm going to just.
Because some of the liquid lipstick is.
Like a little bit shiny still and i.
Really want to make sure it's fully and.
Matte so i'm just gonna go out at the.
Mini palette and grabbing a little bit.
Of a playground on a flat brush having a.
Little bit of a flashback just to.
Highlight yes okay now doing that same.
Exact thing a book and i use the little.
Bits the co-op's adding in some.
Dimension in the wings right up against.
The edges of the butterfly and then.
Creating some super thin little fine.
Strokes like that into the body as well.
It was good now i need to use a tiny.
Liner to outline the butterfly it's so.
Better got maya tomforde liner i'm gonna.
Carefully outline this and also create.
The shapes that are inside the witness.
Okay dot you can't tell me that's not.
Cute that is cute and now last but.
Finally not least i'm going.
To add a few more super tiny dots about.
Light blue just on the bottom horsemen.
Of that wing okay that's cute that is.
Cute that looks good right all right you.
Guys didn't think that is one of the.
Butterflies all complete i was.
Definitely a little bit nervous at first.
But i think this is one of those type of.
Art pieces that definitely takes a lot.
Of like layering to get to the final.
Result and i think it looks pretty cute.
I'm gonna speed through and add two more.
Than john's with my face then we'll come.
Back to finish off this look all right.
You guys these are all three of the.
Butterflies all completes and i think.
This looks so cute i'm literally.
Obsessed at this and very much randy of.
The blue a butterfly look from the.
Campaign last year and now our brand new.
Intro graphics um you could definitely.
Stop right here but i want to keep going.
To turn this kind of hold filter into a.
Look i'm just gonna add on a subtle.
Little blue winged liner just kind of.
Like weighing up my eyes out so grabbing.
This wider brush this is the ambit 213.
And i'm gonna dip into a little bit of a.
Playground on this brush and i'm just.
Going to kind of smudge just on my lash.
Line in the shape of a wing but not.
Worrying about it being too defined.
Focusing at majority of this color on.
The outer portion of my eyelid to really.
Focus on pulling it upwards okay with.
Any extra healthy russian was going to.
Lightly buff out that edge because i do.
Not want it to be a super defined line.
And now i'm just going to grab a an.
Angled brush and dip into a cola the.
Dark blue shade of the pallet once again.
And use this to make a little bit more.
Of like a defined weighing one thing i'm.
Just really pushing the shadow into with.
The lash line and i'm only gonna focus.
This color on that outer corner and wing.
And then you guys know what my little.
New trick just gonna spritz that brush.
And get any excess shadow on there wet.
Pinch it together so it's super sharp.
And then create a tiny little line right.
In that inner corner yes oh my gosh.
That's okay actually i'm happy i did.
This oh yeah then with my little.
Concealer brush from my foundation.
Beforehand describing a tiny little bit.
Of concealer cleaning up that wing oh my.
Gosh i just applied some mascara using.
My mac extended piatt and i'm just gonna.
Pop on my pair of lily lashes at miami.
Flares wow this is a pretty when they.
Snap all right both hands now complete.
And we are so close at the end we only.
Have one step left and that is of course.
The lips now the instagram filters for.
Some reason always like to make the lips.
Like nasa.
And i feel like it's only appropriate to.
A follow suit so i'm going to grab my.
Irregular lip liner which is pervy from.
Colour-pop and i'm going to go a little.
Bit crazy you could do over lining today.
Because actually okay no it does well.
No it's crazy imagine i come back the.
Next video like my sister's jane charles.
Her local dog to each other i was.
Popping on some lipstick and finally.
Gonna top this off some gloss all right.
You guys and this is the blue butterfly.
At filter by agar on instagram all.
Complete i am obsessed with how this.
Left turn out i honestly would have no.
Problem walking out like this in public.
A little details on the butterflies were.
A little bit challenging at first but i.
Think we definitely got the hang of it i.
Think that you guys could easily.
Replicate this at home if you do.
Definitely tweet me a photo and make.
Sure you tag gege as well for credit of.
Course but now it is time to move on to.
The next love the next filter that i.
Really want to use today is one that.
I've been seeing out quite a lot.
Recently and that is a cloudy day by.
Brian now i really like this one because.
It is a little bit more simplistic.
There's no like crazy reshaping like.
Some of the other filters but it is.
Super cute with just some white clouds.
On the cheeks which should be pretty.
Easy to recreate with makeup and then i.
Have a really fun idea for the eye.
Shadow look as well alright ebay so.
Literally all we're gonna need for this.
Look is a white cream paint or liquid.
Lipstick or white concealer literally.
Anything that you have in your.
Collection and then also a white.
Eyeshadow today of course i can be using.
The morphe axioms charles the shade.
Flashback and the palette because it is.
Super super pigmented and also a little.
Concealer brush this is the morphe m22.
For literally what i'm gonna do is just.
Take a little bit of this concealer on.
This brush but i'm going to go in and.
You see a little bit of like a little.
Nice little hump and then with the.
Excess concealer i'm just going to.
Carefully blend.
Downwards just like that and i'm going.
To put another hump right over here and.
Then you look a little bit right in here.
Move a little bit over here as well.
Literally like that took me three.
Seconds flat now with a little fluffy.
Brush i'm just going to grab a little.
Bit of flash back and just set that.
Concealer in place and then also use it.
To kind of buff out that bottom edge.
Because we do want these clouds to look.
Very very fluffy and soft on the face we.
Don't want them to look like they're.
Like very sharp or anything coming up a.
Little bit more concealer then do.
Another one.
Maybe right over here bboogle for a.
Smaller ones huh.
They went over here to a really tiny one.
That's so cute a little cloud floating.
In the end okay with any excess powder.
I'm just gonna put a little bit more.
Flash brown kind of around the cloud.
Region it just what like looks like i.
Don't know it's like floating in the sky.
Or something now i just wanna add a.
Little bit of dimension to these clouds.
So i'm actually gonna pick up the brand.
New at morphe at 35 i palette this just.
Came in the mail this morning and i.
Opened it right away because this.
Palette is so beautiful oh my god it is.
Literally all i see beautiful pastel.
Shades i'm obsessed this i cannot wait.
To create looks with this and this look.
Today i'm little just gonna be using.
This gray shade so you definitely don't.
Have to use this if you don't want to.
Just how does he send it next to me but.
If you guys do wonder check this out i.
Would definitely recommend and of course.
You can use coaching whisper 10% off i'm.
Just gonna use the light gray shade to.
Add some dimensions and between link the.
Little humps of the clouds okay so that.
Is pretty much the filter of this.
Already complete i think it looks super.
Cute now for the.
I had a sneeze coming in that laughs are.
You kidding me.
Jesus for the eye portion of the slug i.
Really want to create a white smokey eye.
Now i'm not sure if this is gonna look.
Ridiculous but we are going to try it so.
I'm just gonna grab a little bit more of.
That white concealer and i'm gonna put.
It on my eyelid aside from like a cut.
Crease i don't think i've ever actually.
Done anything with a white eyeshadow.
Before which is crazy to think about but.
I have wanted to for a very very long.
Time.
So this could look really really cool or.
Really stupid but i guess we're gonna.
Find out in a second.
Honestly that's cool that is cool okay.
So i just looked at my last short i just.
Found these para from daddy b lashes by.
A jenny 69 i love her the absolute most.
And the sale is called ig and i think.
This is actually perfect for this look i.
Really like miami's obviously but i.
Think they're a little bit too intense.
Whereas this will look nice and like i.
Almost want to say like this is really a.
Girl anime style makeup look so what.
This is like very cartoony which i think.
Will be good i just layered on some.
Flash back from my palette over top of.
The white shade from the other palette.
That i was using and literally look at.
How much better that looks not to like.
To my own horn or anything but to to it.
We've handed that alright you guys so.
This is pretty much half of the face of.
This cloud look all complete i'm gonna.
Speed through the other half and we'll.
Be right back to finish off the rest of.
The face wow oh my god this is cute okay.
Now for our last and final step of this.
Makeup look i think i just want to put.
On like a look at a little ombre oh my.
God i'm gonna give a little bit of this.
Red gloss you know talking about oh that.
Is everything oh look at that.
Okay now let's gonna grab a little bit.
Of the fenty beauty gloss in the shade.
Of fussy alright the guys like i said.
Super super simple that is this a cloudy.
Day filter by brian all complete oh my.
Gosh i love how this one turned out it.
Was very easy to recreate i think that.
You guys could definitely do this at.
Home i think this look is very light and.
Gellick almost euphoric if you will this.
Is a very lucky for his style and makeup.
Look i like this i definitely wanna try.
Out more looks with my eye shadow in the.
Future as well let me know what you guys.
Think if you recreate this make sure you.
Tag me and the original creator but.
Let's move on to our last and final.
Filter okay i somehow managed to get all.
The clouds and the white makeup off my.
Face and we are back to my normal base.
Ready for the final filter isn't popular.
As i miss kylie jenner and it ends this.
One which is called a cherry on the cake.
By barbara balance.
Now as you guys can see there's.
Definitely more of that like crazy.
Reshaping a fact that we had in filter.
Number one so we can do that again at.
With those hips and this look these ones.
Were crazy we have a whole lot of pinky.
Tone blush which i've been loving.
Recently some pink eyeliner and then.
Also two super cute cherries on the.
Cheekbones which we can draw on with.
Some liquid lipsticks again there.
Shouldn't be too hard one to recreate.
And i think it looks really awesome so.
Let's just jump right in alright you.
Guys so for the first step of this.
Filter i want to go ahead and add the.
Pinky toe in a blush all over the face.
I'm gonna use this blush from that.
Called dolly mix and just this little.
Cute chocolate hill blush brush i wonder.
Do this first just because blush is one.
Of those things that tends to kind of.
Wear off during the makeup application.
Process and i don't want it to go away.
So we're gonna load this on there.
Great we're just gonna can i bring it up.
To my temple just a little bit as well.
Why not might as well fade it up there.
Does it have a little bit of blush on.
The nose as well let's see oh yeah it.
Goes all the way up geez like the entire.
Face is pink i mean i love blush but.
This is a little bit excessive what.
About on the nose why not.
Alright now i'm gonna go ahead and add.
The highlighter so just taking nm5 whole.
One brush i'm gonna dip into literally.
From the palette and you guys know i use.
This all the time as a blush shade to.
Mix together at my blush and highlighter.
Because it's kind of like a pinky peach.
Orange each eye on it but it also has a.
Beautiful pink reflect just so i'm gonna.
Put this on my cheekbones give it a.
Little spritz oh look at that that is a.
Gorgeous and then just to intensify that.
Pink glow a little bit i'm gonna throw.
It way back to the og a beauty guru days.
To the anasazi beverly hills moon child.
Pellet this was the first palette that i.
Picked up that have the pink highlighter.
In it as you can see it has clearly been.
Through quite a lot it is so beautiful.
Is that enough blush question oh my god.
I then just super quickly i'm gonna add.
On a few of faux freckles to this look.
Just because it does have them in the.
Original filter and i want to stay true.
To it let's draw some cherries so to.
Draw the cherries once again i'm gonna.
Use a liquid lipstick and for this i'm.
Just gonna grab the kylie in the shade.
The after party matte but of course you.
Guys can use any red that you want too i.
Like this one because it is definitely.
More of like a pinky tone red then an.
Orange e tone red i'm really sticking a.
True with the color scheme that we.
Clearly have going on right now i wish.
There was like.
Where that i could like stamp this on my.
Face i wonder oh my god let me try to do.
This okay if i use like a bottom of the.
Lipstick it like rub this in there is.
This cheating and i'm now going to try.
To stamp this this might be a really bad.
Decision but it also could be good okay.
Well that was a flaw there we go and now.
I'm just going to i mean i guess i'm.
Just gonna like literally do oh gosh i.
Mean there we go some lovely four.
Circles all right now i'm having a flat.
Brush i'm gonna dip into the shade at.
You're kidding from the palette or any.
Other bright red shadow that you may.
Have just to you know really make the.
Staining that we're about to get even.
Worse and we're going to set that red.
Liquid lipstick in please just to make.
Sure it doesn't move or smudge around.
Okay no in this filter the cherries are.
Actually completely flat and just like.
One-dimensional or i guess.
Two-dimensional hello but y'all know me.
I like to go above and beyond so i just.
Want to take a little shader brush and.
Dip into a little bit of boutique which.
Is the maroon shade from the palette and.
I'm just gonna add a little bit of.
Shading to the cherries just so they're.
Not like one solid color cuz that's kind.
Of boring i'm also gonna take that same.
Brush that we use the white on in the.
Last look for the clouds and grab a.
Little bit of flash back maybe a little.
Bit of pink a tea drink a tea as well to.
The palate then i'm gonna use this to.
Add some highlights in to the opposite.
Corner of the charities now we have to.
Add on the little stems so i'm just.
Going to grab a green liquid lipstick.
And then just connect the two together.
Then i'm just going to draw on the.
Little leaves as well and then i'm just.
Gonna set this in place using a little.
Bit of a social blade from the palette.
Now i'm going to use a block liner and.
Outline everything this is so hard.
Oh okay so now i'm gonna draw the little.
Face details that they have on the.
Filter.
Time for the final details we add in the.
White liner i mean could be better could.
Be worse.
Period alright now just let me know i'll.
Just put some nice pink highlight in my.
Inner corner perhaps some skip from the.
Palette to start off this a lovely oops.
That's bright i hated my palettes to.
Purchase to want a little inner corner.
Glow in there perhaps a little bit of.
Literally i definitely donate that.
That's okay great now we're gonna add a.
Little bit of a brow bone highlight for.
Lashes today i'm just gonna pop all up.
My lily lashes in the style miami.
Regular not the flare this time we are.
Now on to the last step which is of.
Course the ellipse personally i would.
Love to just leave this look right here.
I think this looks super cute i'm very.
Very happy with it so far i don't want.
To do the whole like big lip thing but.
I'm gonna respect the artist so we're.
Just gonna go true to the filter and.
We're gonna over draw the living crap.
Out of my lips once again.
Alright sisters at last with finally not.
Least and that is our cherry on the cake.
By a barbra mite so it's a filter look.
All completes i think out of the three.
Filters that this one was definitely the.
Most challenging it just because getting.
The circles be nice and round getting.
The kind of cherries in the right place.
But in the end i do think this one is.
The cutest little changes on my face but.
I think the simplistic inner corner.
Definitely turned out really really good.
But i'm definitely looking forward to.
Hearing what you guys have to say once.
Again if you read this one that make.
Sure you tie me in the original artist.
