House for once a beautiful pool behind.
Me at nature trees birds plains you guys.
It is literally the best weekend of the.
Entire year because i am an in do.
California with all my best friends here.
For a coach i am obsessed with coachella.
It is by far my favorite time of the.
Entire i've been looking forward to this.
For 365 days now okay like i don't know.
Why it's just such good vibes i love.
Being here i love listening to the music.
I love spending time with my best.
Closest friends that mean the absolute.
World to me i love taking instagram.
Photos if you guys remember last year we.
Kind of shook up the nation just a.
Little bit with the outfits the.
Instagram photos and the lookbook that.
We posted and if y'all thought that was.
Crazy.
Oh we're kicking it off just a few.
Notches this year y'all know that i did.
Not come to play and i am so excited to.
Show you guys all my looks and outfits.
Which you will see at the end of this.
Video but for right now i just wanted to.
Sit down and do a fun little get ready.
With me it is so beautiful outside so.
We're just going to chit chat i was the.
Makeup and get festival ready.
Music.
Super-quick before we jump into the.
Video i want to give a major shout-out.
To sikhi for sponsoring this video and.
Also my overall coachella experience i.
Reached out to them and i was like.
Listen guys i want to bring eleven of my.
Best friend's to vip i coachella how do.
You make this happen and they said.
Sister absolutely and i am so beyond.
Grateful for working with them in case.
You guys do not know seeking is an.
Amazing app that basically puts tickets.
To all your favorite live events or.
Concerts all until one place it makes it.
So easy to shop so you can actually.
Focus on what's most important which is.
Being there and having a really good and.
Fresh time i am so grateful that i got.

If you use code james on the app you get.
$20 off your first set of tickets thank.
You going up for them to sponsoring it.
Check it out download it using the link.
Below and let's jump into the video all.
Right you guys so the first step of my.
Makeup routines today is of course going.
To be at moisturizing it you guys know.
My writer diet is the tatcha dewy skin.
Cream the air here is literally so dry.
Like i am scared then again we are in.
The desert so i should have expected.
This but like it's borderline gross i.
Feel like my lungs are being filled with.
Dirt which is not fun feeling just in.
Case you've never experienced that.
Before i wouldn't recommend 0 out of 10.
There's gonna grab a nice little.
Generous glob on my fingers and really.
Brought this in for a real one jumping.
Right into foundation i'm gonna grab my.
Too faced born this way in the shade.
Golden for today at quite darker than at.
The normal charles skin tone i did get a.
Spray tan of course to be nice and.
Golden for coachella it's literally so.
Hot here though that i've been sweating.
It off in my sleep that is so disgusting.
You probably do not want to hear that.
But we're gonna try our best to.
Much i said try i didn't say try.
Dispatches will a knock though perhaps i.
Shouldn't mix in a little something else.
Do you smell that.
I saw scandal ok flake this is actually.
A pretty decent color for my skin.
Honestly and the sunlight like it's.
Really hard to even tell us a lot really.
Good.
But luckily most have like my neck and.
My top it's gotta be covered in the look.
That i'm wearing today my bottom not so.
Much but we can definitely get away with.
A little bit of a color match i mean.
We've done it and everybody on the path.
So who's stopping us now i think we.
Should just like chitchat and catch up.
While i'm getting ready today because i.
Don't do these like very often and it is.
Always so fun to just catch up with you.
Guys and talk to you and now un on.
What's going on in my life right now.
Pretty happy.
Not gonna lie i've been able to say that.
In kind of a long time now which.
Actually really excited things have.
Finally been looking up going in the.
Right direction i'm working on a lot of.
Really really exciting things and if the.
Business world that i'm super pumped for.
I'm just really really excited for this.
Weekend and to see everybody that i love.
And know and honestly for the future too.
It's been a rough past couple of weeks.
Or something with a lot of stuff but.
Truly like coachella was like the thing.
That i was looking forward to the.
Absolute most and i am just so happy and.
Thankful and blessed that i get to be.
Here with literally like every single.
Person that means the absolute most to.
Me in this world obvious you guys have.
Met a lot of my best friends from the.
Best friends expose video but i'm here.
With laura and cassie and hay-zu's and.
Drew and elton and victor and louis my.
Editor who you guys will meet definitely.
Very very soon.
Even though this is a music festival i.
Obviously am here for work i'm filming.
This video today and alpha chi coachella.
Are very very important for influencers.
Love to be honest even though i am here.
For work it is like a mini vacation at.
The same time and it just feels so good.
To take a little bit of time off and to.
Just focus on the people that mean the.
Most to me and just have a really really.
Good time that was so good.
Speaking of that being so good you guys.
Oh my god yesterday i announced that i.
Deficiency be performing on the.
Coachella mainstage on sunday at the.
Closing day right before ariana my brand.
New hit single a wolf won't won't um.
Literally bigger stage i've ever been on.
It's so exciting no but can you actually.
Imagine a house before that go tell like.
How lent and.
That would be holy crap this one band.
Called razor bumps actually it's.
Performing at coachella and i tweeted a.
Few days ago because obviously if you.
Guys were here last year you would know.
That i didn't exactly have the best luck.
When it came to shaving my you know down.
There and it turned into quite the.
Controversial topic on of social media.
Which first of all is so crazy literally.
Every single person in the entire world.
Has gotten razor bumps at some point in.
Their life let's be honest if you're.
Telling you that you have not then.
You're a liar it's a very very normal.
Thing but this year just let you know.
I've been getting laser hair removal.
Every six weeks and down there it's.
Currently completely hairless we're.
Ready to go ready to be out and revealed.
And there will not be a scandal this.
Year but oh my god when i tweeted that i.
Was actually performing like that as a.
Joke so many people thought i was being.
It serious that my name james charles.
Was literally trending number three.
Worldwide on the apple music charts.
Because people were looking for my.
Single that i was gonna be performing.
Like this actually happened which i.
Thought was literally one of the.
Funniest things in the entire world you.
Guys always that shocked me and how.
Powerful you are like i always forget.
That making jokes like that could.
Actually lead to something very very.
Serious i love being an influencer when.
Using my platform for the right things.
But those are the mr. crazy so i love.
You so much.
All jokes aside unfortunately i will not.
Be performing at coachella this year but.
You never know what next year has to.
Hold it's not a coachella performance i.
Guarantee you that just contains a quick.
Spritz of the morphine prep and set.
Settings right and then i was gonna be a.
Little bit of the laura mercier.
Translucent setting powder and sat in on.
My face i could literally just sit here.
And stare at the camera for five minutes.
And my foundation would completely dry.
Down that's literally how dry the air is.
Here but i do want to make sure i set.
Like under my eyes and then or my.
Forehead just to avoid a creasing it.
Because i will definitely be sweating it.
Later on and then once that is all set.
In place i'm just going to use my usual.
Anasazi beverly hills contour kit and my.
Morphe.
For all five just to chisel off my face.
But sense my foundation is a little bit.
Darker i'm just gonna go a little bit.
Heavier this time that could be.
Literally the worst mistake of my life.
Oh my god we just like what this here's.
Actual like music lineup for the.
Festival - i'm so pumped for the last.
Few years i'm not gonna lie i definitely.
Was more in it.
Instagram photos just because even.
Though i love music and it's such a big.
Part of my life there are not that many.
Artists that i like specifically listen.
To i definitely the type person that.
Just turns on the radio and just sings.
Along with whatever is currently on and.
Enjoys it.
But this year i think there's so many.
Artists that i was actually looking.
Forward to getting to watch last night i.
Watched burbank for the first time and.
It was literally like a life-changing.
Experience i announced on twitter a few.
Days ago that i'm officially a stan okay.
I'm a fellow blink and i got to see them.
Live last night in the artist section 2.
Which was so crazy because they were.
Literally right there i am beyond.
Obsessed with black pink jenny at least.
Outros a jisu i love you guys literally.
The obstacles in the entire world just.
Truly one of the most incredible.
Experiences and performances i've ever.
Seen the dancing the choreography not a.
Single beat mess not a single word miss.
Not a single note mess like absolute.
Perfection i am beyond obsessed kacey.
Musgraves perform yesterday i heard to.
See a little bit of her set bazi.
Performs today i'm so excited to watch.
Him billie is on stage tonight and i am.
So pumped oh my god this is gonna be my.
First time ever seeing her live.
I am a true billie i list and right now.
I am like obsessed with her brand new.
Album i think it is so beyond incredible.
I just discovered her music a few months.
Ago but i've been listening to it.
Literally non-stop and i think her vibe.
Is just so what different and so cool to.
Watch she really inspires me i would.
Love to video with her one day i think.
There'll be the craziest thing ever i.
Know she literally never wears makeup.
But like just imagine a one-time full.
Glam moment would be so fun and fresh i.
Think tame impala is later on tonight as.
Well tomorrow is ariana grande oh my god.
I cannot wait to see all of her newest.
Songs performed live i was gonna try to.
Go to her la tour saw but unfortunately.
I'll be traveling when she's here so i.
Get to see her at coachella which is so.
Fun and so fresh ariana's definitely my.
Favorite performers as well i went to.
Her concert a few years ago and it was.
Just absolutely mind-boggling so it's.
Just a really really cool year so i'm.
Really excited to actually go and be.
Able to listen to the music and watch.
The performances rather than just be and.
Instagram body which is like what.
Everybody makes fun of coachella for.
Definitely can admit that that's been me.
In the past but not this year.
She's a body and a music lover trudy.
Want to say hi hi everyone.
I like a little crusted and dusted but.
That's okay though everybody's james.
Looks good so all the matters who are.
