Omg i cringed so hard when he said he.
Was that makeup artist seriously no.
You're not lol did you train did you.
Study.
Or go to beauty school now so then.
You're not classified as a makeup artist.
If you haven't got the certificate and.
Paper to show it then it doesn't count.
You as a makeup artist i would know.
Because i.
Rashon ever qualified makeup artists.
He's right.
Really rashon because my 5.3 million.
Followers and this piece of paper beg to.
Differ hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel as.
I'm sure you guys are very much aware.
Comments are a huge part of the youtube.
Community i receive thousands and.
Thousands and thousands to come up to.
Every single video mostly from you guys.
Who are always spreading so much love.
And positivity and really make me do.
What i want to do so thank you for.
Always being the absolute best but.
Alongside the love also comes a whole.
Lot of hate comments when i was younger.
Probably the most valuable thing to my.
Mother ever taught me was if you don't.
Have anything nice to say don't say.
Anything at all for me personally i.
Don't think i have ever once left a hate.
Comment on anybody else's content they.
Work really really hard on but.
Apparently that lesson was not talked to.
The thousands and thousands and.
Thousands of people who feel that they.
Are just superior beings and that.
They're unnecessary and rude comments.
Just need to be heard now don't get me.
Wrong there's definitely a huge.
Difference between constructive.
Criticism and hate comments for me.
Personally i love a constructive.
Criticism i did this job every single.
Day for you guys and to inspire you guys.
All around the world and if there's any.
Way that i can make my videos better my.
Makeup better my personality better my.
Lighting better i absolutely want to do.
It and there's a very very nice way to.
Leave positive suggestions but for the.
Most part people don't know how to do.
That because everyone's ego is just too.
Large including mine this idea came.
About how beauty it's know when i was.
Reading comments i mean do this video.
And somebody proceeded there hey comment.
By literally saying sister james i love.
You so much but i just feel like this.
Needed to be fat i then wrote something.
Very very nice to you to creating myself.
My hard work and my career needed oh.
Julia.
Sweetie sno-cones darling pumpkin you.
Needed to write that comment actually um.
No nobody asked for your opinion you.
Didn't need to do anything according to.
This very official piece of paper right.
Here i am clearly a certified mua but.
According to the youtube comments.
Apparently so it's every other person.
That watches my video so for today i.
Thought it'd be very very fun to do a.
Video inspired by yuki where i take a.
Bunch of comments from people that just.
Thought their opinions had to be heard.
And i'm hi those two my makeup routine.
Because apparently i can't do makeup i.
Am just so excited to listen to all.
These extremely talented and trained.
Makeup artists tell me exactly what i.
Should be doing for a makeup routine.
Hopefully i'll look so much better than.
Normal and let's just jump right in.
Music.
Our first step as always is gonna be our.
Foundation and our base routine and i.
Definitely get a lot of comments about.
My foundation in every single video i.
Can definitely admit i'm not the best at.
Foundation matching so i figured i would.
Take some advice from the comments today.
This comin comes from haley and she says.
James i love you but your foundation is.
Ten shades too dark you look burnt hmm.
I'm just gonna grab a little bit of a.
Lighter shades today and apply this all.
Over my face oh yeah this is a way of.
Better match for me i think mm-hmm i.
Mean after all the sister scandals that.
I've had the last thing that i want to.
Add to that list is culture.
Appropriation so thank god we're getting.
This advice now another one we have.
Heard today is from maria and she says.
Is it just me or does anybody else think.
That this donation sheet is just way too.
Orange and blue boots are shaking oh.
Yeah looking back i think maria is.
Definitely right when it comes to this i.
Mean it's not like i've seen every.
Single video that i always like to be a.
Little bit more tan so thank god she's.
Putting this out today let me see what i.
Can look for if i'm not going for more.
Of an orange foundation i think i need.
To find something with more of a pink.
Undertone so let me see what i can find.
You guys oh my god after three years of.
Doing beauty videos i think we've.
Finally officially found the foundation.
Shade that matches me perfectly it's a.
Miracle this next time it comes from.
Shelby and she says james you're a doll.
But sweetie and i'm not saying this to.
Be cruel or critical just the experience.
Of a viewer of course it would be much.
More enjoyable watching if you slow down.
Way down you're talking moving so fast.
Your energy is so frantic that for.
Low-key people like me it makes watching.
You very very stressful your kinetic.
Energy is clearly very high and i'm sure.
That you have to exert a lot of effort.
Energy to slow it down entertain it but.
I assure you and make your videos so.
Much more enjoyable between hyper's be.
Talking in your thoughts hand movements.
Featured in camera it's just a bit much.
Hon again i'm not saying this to be mean.
A cool or critical simply to share my.
Experience in watching your videos and.
Give you a little bit of input much love.
To you sister shelby oh see this is a.
Really great example of constructive.
Criticism and i definitely get comments.
About the speed am i talking a lot so.
Let me see what i can do to really help.
You guys out because i've never want to.
Make my videos hard to watch.
All right guys so my next stop in my.
Beauty routine is going to be the.
Concealer and for today i want to use my.
Tart shave tape and the shade fair i'm.
Just going to take the wand and apply it.
To all of the high points of my face i.
Am just trying a triangle or right.
Underneath my eyes and kind of filling.
In a little bit just to bring some more.
Attention to that area i'm just putting.
Some in the center of my forehead and i.
Am gonna put a line right down my nose.
And then maybe just a little bit on my.
Chin to cover the five o'clock shadow.
And then of course just gonna take my.
Damp beauty blender.
And blend it out this next one comes.
From rebecca and she says holy sh why.
Are you using so much powder i cannot.
Even imagine how cakey and horrible and.
Growth you look in person.
Oh rebecca i see myself in the mirror.
All the time and i think i look pretty.
Good but i guess it means a lot more.
Coming from you guys who really see me.
All the time so maybe i'll just write.
Ooh use a little bit less today mmm you.
Know what i think that's a lot better.
Rebecca i think you'll like this one.
Girl.
These next comments are some of my.
Favorites and they are talking about.
Bronzing and contouring this first one.
Comes from courtney and she says your.
Contour looks way too harsh.
Holy crop why does your forehead look.
Like it got burnt this one comes from.
Jonathan and he says sweetie your nose.
Contour isn't fooling anybody yes i love.
It when you guys leave me nasty comments.
About the two things that i talk openly.
About began to care about and try to fix.
His contouring really means a lot and.
Does a lot for my self-esteem this last.
One comes from brianna and she said.
You're literally red okay whoo i mean i.
Thought my contour looked pretty good.
But clearly we have a lot to fix today.
According to these professional anyway.
So it looks like we need to make my.
Contour a little bit more cool toned i'm.
A little bit less harsh and i need to.
Stop contouring my nose so tiny so let's.
See what we can do oh my god.
Yes slay i'm contouring with the ashes i.
Both left my self-esteem up to this.
Video and i think it looks so good for.
The forehead i definitely i want to look.
First i guess we're just gonna use like.
The littlest bit perfect not gonna lie i.
Am a little bit scared and nervous.
Change up my nose contour but i think.
Jonathan definitely knows what he's.
Talking about so i'm just gonna give.
Herself a more natural look today ah oh.
My god wait i actually love it jonathan.
Thank you so much holy crap i thought my.
Nose was snatched before but how like.
This natural bigger the better look i.
Think it's just the way to go from now.
On this next one it comes from orion's r.
And they said your contour blush is.
Horrible you put way too much blush on.
So it looks like you've a red cheek on.
Your face and then your contours just a.
Dark brown line on your face it's barely.
Even blended so you shouldn't even be a.
Makeup artist because your face makeup.
Is horrible the only good thing about it.
Is your highlight thank you.
At least i'm doing one thing right oh.
Yes the haters are all being blinded.
Right now.
Well we love a stock sister all right.
Guys so next we have the bras which i'm.
Actually really really excited for have.
You been following me for a very long.
Time on instagram but you know that my.
Brows have underwent such a major.
Transformation and it's honestly a lot.
Because of you guys and a lot of the.
Hate comments i received at first i just.
Really could not take the conjuncture.
Criticism i thought my brows were so so.
So beautiful but finally i realized that.
There were literally just the worst this.
First one comes from baylin kibeho and.
She says bro if you don't fix your brows.
Your eye look is so warm and your brow.
Color is ashy they're gray okay this one.
Comes from emily and she says anybody.
Else think that he should really maybe.
Trim his eyebrow hair and make them a.
Little bit thinner they are so super.
Boxy nothing against him he's so great.
But i think he would really look much.
Better smiley face this one comes from.
Melancholic mexican there's a scandal.
These eyebrows are way too thick they're.
Supposed to be thin like skinny legend.
Mariah carey true and finally we have.
This one from i hate aloha and she says.
Boy i think those eyebrows need to be.
Closer together okay so i definitely.
Don't want my brows to look ashy today.
That is a major major nono so instead of.
My regular brow pencil i grab the mac.
Lip pencil in the shade of burgundy this.
Was just a little bit more red tone so.
Hopefully it'll match with the i like.
That i do later on and then according to.
Everyone else they need to be a little.
Bit more arch a little bit skinnier and.
Closer together you know we're really.
Going for that look of like raising your.
Eyebrows at all times to show everybody.
That i'm very very interested in what.
They're having to say there we go.
Super arched definitely a little bit.
Thinner than normal then bring it right.
Back down oh my god yes that looks so.
Much better than normal.
According to i hate ulua they really.
Should be almost touching because you.
Nawroz are very much back in style and.
Trend so really gonna do that there and.
Then of course we have to make them.
Eyebrow twins they can't be sister so i.
Checked it exactly even well i think.
That's the best they've ever looked.
Okay so pretty good right like we.
Definitely a little bit of concealer.
Just to clean them up a little bit.
Really just got a sister snatch them.
Oh yes for all you yes that is exactly.
What we're going for tonight that it's.
So good.
Well this eyebrow is just a skinny.
Legend oh my god.
Mariah whoo this is how close i am to.
Losing my mind wow i think this is.
Finally it since starting my instagram.
Account three years ago i've just gotten.
So many comments about my eyebrows being.
Too thick or not arched enough or just.
Too big and i've had so many brands not.
Repost me because of it and maybe.
Finally i'll have a chance in the beauty.
Real now thank you to everybody who.
Suggested this today because i love this.
So now that our browser hashtag on fleek.
I think we are in a really good place to.
Start out the eye shadow so this comin.
Comes from shannon and she says you.
Always do a half cut crease holy is.
There anything else you could do or are.
You really just not talented at all.
Music.
No.
Okay so i really want to add a winged.
Let's look i feel like it'll just pull.
Everything super super it together and.
Thank god we have comments from you guys.
Telling me how to do it so i don't do it.
Wrong and this one come from divine bond.
Dagger and this is on my drive video and.
She says sister james your eyeliner.
Needs to be thicker okay no problem i.
Can definitely get thicker thank you and.
This one comes from andrew and he says.
Girl why was your wing so sore.
You really should have made a sharp.
Enough to cut it right so definitely to.
Listen to andrew we need to make our.
Line or really a really long and then.
According to it divine we need to make.
It really thick so let's bring this just.
Up andres really you know we love a.
Thick sister you know who cares about.
The hours of time we spend on blending.
Our eyeshadow like wing liner is really.
Aware it's it just really opens up the.
Eye just frames the face so well i.
Definitely would say winged liner make.
It nice and thick every day wow i think.
They were so right my wings are big.
Enough and sharp enough to almost fly.
Away i love that alright so the eye look.
Is almost complete and i'm literally.
Loving it so far and her necks it was.
Going to be a lash it said i'm actually.
Really really excited for this one.
Because similar to brows i've always.
Charcoal just a little bit with lashes.
When i first started to do makeup i.
Would always go to my eye shot and even.
Still to this day i have very very.
Sensitive eye so sometimes eyelashes.
Will come off or they won't sit right.
And there's a little bit wonky so i'm.
Really looking forward to reading your.
Guys's advice today and hopefully being.
Able to fix them this coming home from.
Samuel and he says no sister the lashes.
You chose for this look we're all wrong.
They close off your eyes making them.
Appear smaller you should have used a.
Way bigger lash that flares outwards and.
Really lift the eye up rather than.
Squashing it down.
Okay so samuel thinks we need to use a.
Big lash today which i'm totally down.
For i mean i love my mami's but.
Sometimes you just gotta be a little bit.
Extra you know so i grab these three oh.
Ones i think they're really gonna do the.
Job.
Okay so just put on some glue and now.
Sam said when we put them on we need to.
Make sure that the washes really go.
Upwards so they don't close down the eye.
So i'm gonna put this right here in the.
Inner corner perfect and then it's gonna.
Pull this tail and right up here oh yeah.
Only really lift it everything straight.
Up wow okay so those are looking up.
Great but i think they could be a little.
Bit more lifted so you know what.
Really get them up there let them up gal.
Hmm this looks amazing.
Rfa so this look is almost complete and.
Our next item is going to be the lipid e.
Doodahs you know starting from day one.
I've learned so many techniques about.
Over lining and making them look.
Beautiful of course i've gotten lip.
Filler but you know what there's always.
Ways that i can really improve my.
Technique so this comment comes from.
Jessica and she says sister love you but.
Your over line your lips way too much.
They look like they're about to explode.
You know what fair no date sometimes i.
Definitely come in at that i go a little.
Bit overboard so let's just bring them.
Back to their normal size whoa oh my god.
Jessica girl you are literally so bright.
I am actually gonna call my doctor right.
Now and ask her to dissolve the lip.
Filler because this just looks the best.
Hashtag natural beauty is the best.
Beauty this next one i actually get all.
The time it is always a top comment on.
My video and you know what i hear you.
Guys takaya says sis then lips dry.
Though hannah says how you gonna be a.
Guru and have your lips looking dry as.
How sunshine says i feel like his lips.
Are always so dry the indie said wow.
James's lips are about as dry as his sex.
Life you got me there.
You know what you guys are totally right.
Nobody likes a crusty lip it is.
Definitely soso service and not the way.
To go let's accept eventually wow.
Oh my god so much better alright you.
Guys oh my god i think we're actually.
Done with this look today and looking in.
The mirror this is by far the best i've.
Heard looked oh my god i am so glad that.
I set my ego aside and just really.
Listened to everybody who knew exactly.
What they were talking about because.
Clearly this is the result and our last.
But final step was going to be sat.
Anything in place so we can really just.
Keep this on all day long and thank god.
We have one last comment to really guide.
Us through the setting spray and that is.
From tegea.
And she says that wasn't his friends it.
Was the full-on shower you need to use.
Way less setting spray oh okay maybe.
Maybe if i use less it'll really lock it.
In all day long.
Let's try that's it all right you guys.
That is all i have for this video today.
This is venice so much fun to film this.
Look i mean can we talk about it.
Literally iconic 1 million likes on.
Instagram here we come.
On a more serious note obviously this.
Video was satire and i was just joking.
Around in a play.
And light-hearted manner but if i said.
That hate comments never affected me i.
Would 100% be lying because of him being.
Honest they do obviously i try my.
Absolute best to put on a good front for.
You guys and always inspire people and.
Preach positivity but i'm a normal human.
Being just like you are i have feelings.
And sometimes comments really do hurt.
Before you write something please think.
Is this necessary to say is this helpful.
Is this constructive because like my.
Momma said if you don't have anything.
Nice to say don't say anything at all on.
The contrary at the end of the day.
