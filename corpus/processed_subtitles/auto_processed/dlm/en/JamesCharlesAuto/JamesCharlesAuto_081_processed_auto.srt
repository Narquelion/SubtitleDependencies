Hi sisters james harold's here and.
Welcome back to our youtube channel as.
You can see we're not in the normal.
White ball background makeup studio.
Because today i am here in coachella.
Valley in california because it is.
Coachella this weekend and i am.
Literally so excited i mean all my.
Friends got sisters vip passes it's.
Hashtag lit anyway i wish i did not just.
Say that but for today's video i wanted.
To do a fun festival inspired makeup.
Tutorial i want to do a rainbow look.
It's been a hot minute since i've.
Actually played with color and a few.
Weeks ago i posted a rainbow eye picture.
On my instagram and it's out of my.
All-time at most like photos so thank.
You and sisters for always killing of.
The game and then also i did maybe go.
And buff and beyond with my coachella.
Alpha it's like your guys's wigs are.
About to be snatched at this point when.
Seeing this video you guys have already.
Probably seen them over on my instagram.
But at the end of the video as well i.
Want to do a little fun at coachella.
Lookbook so i hope you guys are excited.
And let's get on the video i'm first.
Gonna talk with using a good sunscreen.
This is the touch-up pore perfecting.
Silk'n sunscreen hello spf 35 we are.
Obviously in the middle of the desert.
And it is really ridiculously hot here.
And the sun is intense so it's really.
Important that you protect your skin.
Even when you're putting a full face of.
Makeup on it can definitely penetrate.
All the way through and i rather be safe.
Than sorry i'm also gonna use my.
All-time babe the touch out water cream.
Moisturizer i love this thing it's.
Literally so good like hello it just.
Makes my skin it's so soft and smooth.
And the air out here is ridiculously dry.
Like i said we're in the middle of a.
Desert so i really want to make sure.
That my skin is hydrated and doesn't get.
The air sucked out of it and last but.
Not least first skin prep i'm gonna go.
To the touch-ups cell canvas you guys.
Know i'm really not a big fan of primers.
But this one for some reason it's just.
Really really bomb it fills in the pores.
And honestly makes my skin so so so.
Smooth and with the amount of dust.
That's gonna be flying around in the air.
At this festival i really want to make.
Sure for once my pores are filled so.
They can't get clogged and other stuff.
If that makes sense.
Skincare 101 with sister james.
Foundation said i'm gonna go to the too.
Faced born this way foundation you guys.
Know this is my all-time a favor and a.
Fun fact actually last year at coachella.
Was the first time i ever tried this.
Foundation and i literally have fall in.
Love with it and used it ever since.
And thank you doing friend hay-zu's for.
Showing it to me it's actually so cool.
Because a lot of my friends have changed.
A lot this past year but my best friends.
Have all remained exactly this.
And last year coachella it was me and.
Laura and victor and marcos and his.
Girlfriend brittany and then hay-zu's.
And we just got crunk and partied the.
Entire time sober of course but now.
We're all back here together and it's.
Just such an amazing amazing group of.
Friends that i am so blessed to have in.
My life.
I'm literally pray that this foundation.
Color is going to match me when i take.
Photos later on today i did just get.
Spray tans literally the darkest i've.
Ever been and i was hoping that it was.
Gonna wash off a lot in my shower this.
Morning and it did it but you know what.
We're just going for that bronzy.
Coachella type of look i'm really really.
Hoping that this foundation matches it's.
Kind of hard to tell because we are an.
Outside lighting which i'm definitely.
Not used to but we're gonna make it work.
It's actually so crazy to think about.
Because i'm pretty sure when i went to.
Coachella last year with laura and all.
The sisters that my instagram was just.
Over 1 million followers like you're.
Literally kidding me and we just hit 4.
Million a few days ago like that is so.
Beyond insane to me i was looking.
Through all the photos from last year.
And just reminiscing and i'm just so.
Excited to be here again i really really.
Do love music festivals and obviously.
You guys know music plays a huge part in.
My life and i'm just so excited to just.
Listen to some really really dope music.
Have some really amazing outfits and.
Just see a ton of friends and a bunch of.
You guys as well i think there's gonna.
Be a full-on.
Sister be angry i like taking over.
Coachella but i am so beyond ready for.
It.
The air here is literally so dry.
Concealers already drying down oh my god.
I'm scared but you took one this so fast.
Oh there's b there's a b there's b oh.
It's a fly i don't know i've never.
Actually talked about this on camera.
Before but i am like literally deathly.
Afraid of bees for some reason i've.
Never been stung don't even know if i'm.
Allergic i just hate that with all my.
Heart i'm gonna blend out this concealer.
Underneath my eyes and then literally.
Hover my setting powder like right at.
The ready i'm so scared at how dry this.
Weather is and how fast everything is.
Drying down which means if we don't set.
This fast enough we're gonna get sister.
Creases and all the wrong places all day.
Long for the remainder my face i'm gonna.
Grab a really dense powder puff and.
Really pack it into the powder and pat.
This on it has been a hot minute since.
I've like really a baked and powdered my.
Faith but i am gonna be really really.
Hot and sweaty today the sun is like.
Beaming down yeah i know the alpha that.
You guys are gonna see it later on in.
Today's lookbook video i am gonna be.
Wearing a face mac so i really wanna.
Make sure that my face is very very set.
And pleased to get as little foundation.
Transfer on it as possible because it's.
A sister louie vuitton bandana and that.
Was way too expensive to have a.
Foundation encrusted and dusted all over.
It before i go in and really contour my.
Face i'm gonna grab the brand new k'kaw.
Highlighting.
Brightening powder oh my god if you guys.
Thought my video over on nikkietutorials.
Channel reviewed this this powder is so.
Bomb like literally and sane i have an.
Absolutely lovingness to pack on right.
In the high points of my face to give it.
A really really bright end and contoured.
Look i'm also gonna pop this right up.
Here in the corners of my eyes right.
Down onto the middle of my face and onto.
The sides of the nose to help further.
That snatched illusion coming in a.
Second next make sure we have that.
Bronzy summery glow i'm gonna grab my.
Morphe am 5 to 7 brush and my anasazi a.
Contouring kit and dip into the right.
Two shades right up in here and use this.
To really chisel on my face today hey.
Sister oh we got sister laura coming.
Tail i mostly make sure to really.
Contour out and snatch that jawline as.
Well you guys know we gotta be as as.
Little as possible at all times always i.
Definitely need to chisel out my nose.
And make her good and snatch this.
Lighting is a little bit spooky so it's.
Probably looking the worst oh that's a.
Little harsh oh i'm actually really.
Happy with how the base is looking right.
Now or at least i think i am before i'm.
Gonna really bake everything out i am.
Gonna give myself a light spritz of the.
Skins a navy eye makeup finishing spray.
Before we put on a more powder this to.
Do is it sponsored by scandinavia so.
Thank you so much to them for sending me.
And my friends to coachella you guys.
Know i don't really work as a whole lot.
Of brands here on my channel but i just.
Really really love skins a navy and.
They're by far one of the best brands i.
Have ever worked and they're just so.
Nice they trust me as an influencer i.
Loved in the most so makeup finishing.
Spray so bomb obviously were gonna use.
It just our face but just to give it a.
Little sister hydration because we're.
Looking a little bit dry right now i.
Guess we're gonna use our ticket box to.
Fan our piece today because i forgot my.
Dad at home i got a good question i'm.
Really really looking forward to.
Obviously sister beyonce and sister.
Cardi b i'm sister says oh there's.
Knowing about her once.
Yeah rollerskating she was literally so.
Sweet she was with her two nieces and.
They were sisters so hey it says his.
Nieces if you guys are watching and she.
Was just so nice literally the entire.
Time she was like interacting with.
Different people at the roller skating.
Rink.
This acting like a normal person which.
Was just like really really dope to see.
Because she's one of the biggest people.
In the world right now she's so talented.
Like hello i'm a sister says a stand to.
See her perform today i'm gonna bake.
Myself in the oven for a few minutes i.
Guess just by standing out on the sun.
Because literally thought is like the.
Heat temperature we're dealing with.
Right now at home do my brows off-camera.
Quickly i'll be right back to start off.
The eye makeup.
Let's go ahead and jump right into this.
Rainbow i look and of course that i'll.
Be using the morphe at 35 be pella this.
Is my all-time favorite i already went.
Ahead and started up writing my eyelids.
And instead of using a translucent.
Powder i actually use the white.
Eyeshadow here so hopefully that'll make.
All the colors a little bit brighter i'm.
Gonna grab a fluffy brush and dip into.
The yellow shade first and pop that.
Right in the inner corners normally you.
Guys know i'd like to start off kind of.
Light and then blend in it but for these.
Type of looks i'm really gonna pack the.
Colors in there and then blend them in.
After because i really want the colors.
To be as pegmatite as possible next.
Gonna grab a fluffy blending brush into.
The orange shade impact that right in.
The center on the crease well take kind.
Of placing that color on there and then.
Blending it out i think you should have.
Really focuses pigment right in the.
Crease because i am going to cut it.
Today and then just use the excess.
Shadow left on the brush to blend it.
Upwards into this region and also.
Slightly into the color next to it after.
I finished each color i'm gonna go back.
Into the previous color with the same.
Exact brush and make sure that they're.
Evenly blended together right in that.
Transitional region next under grab one.
Last faulty blending brush in the bright.
Red shade in the palette and i'm going.
To finish off that i look and i'm.
Actually gonna pull the shadow white out.
Into the classic v-shape that you guys.
Know i live before wasn't owl hooting.
00 p.m. all right.
I was nocturnal they're awake and let.
Ready to go i'm also gonna pop the same.
Exact colors in the same order on my.
Lower lashline as well what i did this.
Look originally i went with a very very.
Bright look but for today's look that i.
Have planned i'm doing a very very like.
Ninja inspired type of dark and smoky.
Looks like i'm gonna using a whole lot.
Of black to really smoke this out and.
Make the colors really really intense.
I'm gonna go ahead and line my lower and.
Upper water lines that i using the.
Maybelline lasting drama waterproof.
Pencil i just picked this one up super.
Quickly at a store i forgot mine at home.
Love that of course sister james is.
Forgetting everything are we surprised.
We really shouldn't be you guys know i.
Absolutely hate doing this but i feel.
Like it is very very vital for the type.
Of look that we're going forward today.
Oh well that's dark and it's gonna.
Really highlight my eyes if you guys.
Notice as well it has been a hot minute.
Since i've worn my grey contacts in a.
Video but i feel like they're.
Appropriate for today's look i'm gonna.
Grab a small flat pocket brush this is.
The sigma e 20s and very very carefully.
At up off the excess and then blend this.
Right into the lower lash line.
Okay need way more than that or the.
Outer v region to actually want the.
Block to be really really defined this.
Is a really really good and thick.
Cardboard so i'm gonna do is actually.
Rip this and this is a technique that a.
Lot of different drag queen.
And i'm actually going to hold this.
Cardboard onto my eye i don't know how.
To do this here bob could you friend who.
Hold your handheld mirror for you that's.
A legit sister right there okay i'm.
Gonna place this card right on the.
Corner of my eye i'm placing the shade.
On here in the shape of kind of like a.
Winged liner and then i'm of course.
Going to blend it out by having this.
Cardboard there and really pressing it.
Onto the face you're gonna get a really.
Really clean line when i take this off.
We're just gonna make it so much easier.
Because you guys know if with a little.
Bit too much black your look can go from.
Really really beautiful to really really.
Muddy and spooky real real fast if.
You're not careful oh wow i really.
Thought i had it there i'm scared i'm.
Gonna have another smaller fluffy brush.
And some more black shadow and attempt.
To blend out this outer corner it's.
Looking a little bit spooky totally i.
Don't know how to take my own advice and.
The situation and i'm gonna pull this.
Really lightly into the crease right.
Before we get ready to cut it this is.
Looking spooky i was really confident.
This time i'm not as confident that on.
This side of the yard there's little old.
Me filming a rainbow makeup tutorial and.
On that side of the yard laura's husband.
And her brother are having a drinking.
Competition to see who can drink a can.
Of beer faster.
I love coachella okay i think i'm.
Actually kind of happy with how this is.
Turning out maybe it's lightly i'm just.
Basically going in a back-and-forth with.
Both black and the different colors that.
I'm using to really create the eye shape.
That i'm trying to go for today it's.
Really hard to blend black seamlessly.
Into other colors especially ones that.
Are bright like orange and yellow and.
Create a seamless transition but i feel.
Like we did a pretty decent job now that.
I have the basic eye all complete i'm.
Gonna take a really really light.
Concealer this is the k'kaw beauty one.
Put it on the back of my hand and i'm.
Going to cut my crease using a mac 242.
Brush and before that can see that even.
Dries down i'm gonna go ahead and grab.
The in your dreams.
Iridescent angel cosmetic glitter impact.
That right over top of the lid for a.
Nice pop oh my god that is so pretty.
Oh you're kidding hello okay now i'm.
Actually loving how this is looking so.
This took a nice turn for the better.
For once now that we have the glitter.
All place on though i'm gonna grab that.
Fluffy brush that had a black on it and.
Kind of blend out this outer v if so.
There's an even transition between the.
Glitter and the black and i'm gonna kind.
Of pull this into the lash line as well.
So it creates like a more rounded cut.
Crease type of shape i forgot glitter.
Glue on this shape which is classic me.
So i'm gonna grab a little bit of lash.
Glue and dab it on the back of my hand.
And try to like i don't even know how.
I'm gonna.
That's rude i'm gonna get the tom ford.
Liner as well into a fan up black line.
Along by a flashlight just for some more.
Dimension i'm gonna grab that flat.
Smudging brush that we used on the lower.
Lash in as well dive into a little bit.
Of block and then go right over that.
Liner that we just put on there so it's.
Kind of a more smudge liner type of love.
All right guys and that is one eye off.
Complete obviously we still have lashes.
To do but that took me a hot minute so.
I'm gonna call the cameras quickly relax.
In the shader for a little bit so i'm.
Not burning and do the other eye.
Off-camera of course at the green blue.
And then purple and i'll be right back.
To finish off the rest of the love all.
Right case about one hour later now.
Literally coachella's gonna be over by.
The time i'm done with my makeup today.
But i just finished both eyes i deftly.
Was not loving them at first but i think.
They definitely turned out pretty decent.
And of course we have sister face soon.
To save the day so i'm gonna play a.
Light coat of the mac extended play.
Mascara to prep for lashes i'm gonna.
Make sure to get those really really.
Evenly coated as well because you guys.
Know i don't really do what black smokey.
Looks very often but when i do to them.
It's really important that you get a.
Good coat of mascara so that there's no.
Light spots and everything blends really.
Really well together and then for lashes.
Today i'm gonna pop on a pair of lillie.
Lashes miami's you guys know these are.
My all-time faves and wispy i did not.
Spend an hour on each eye look today to.
Get them covered up by a big lashes so.
These be the perfect solution i'm gonna.
Pop this right on the exact center of.
The eyelid and really make sure to pull.
That ending upwards because we did do a.
V-shape with this eye shadow look today.
And i want to make sure that the eyelash.
Follows suit and doesn't look droopy.
Because you really want the eyes to look.
Kind of a port and snatched oh yeah.
She's looking good this is really good.
Okay alright so those are both eyes all.
Done and complete thank the lord that.
Took way too long and now it's time for.
The glow so i'm gonna grab my anasazi of.
Beverly hills so hollywood highlighter.

That i'm gonna get myself once again a.
Quick spritz of the skin to navia.
