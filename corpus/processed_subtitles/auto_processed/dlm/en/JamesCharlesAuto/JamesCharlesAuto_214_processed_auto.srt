Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel so.
Music.
I've been so busy lately doing so many.
Different shoots and so many different.
Projects that i have barely had any time.
To get a creative look done so today i.
Really wanted to sit down and throw.
Something together that was cool and.
Conceptual it is the fish library which.
Means this month is valentine's day i'm.
Not excited it was my least here at.
Holiday because i've been single for it.
For 17 years now and let's be real it's.
Gonna be 18 in just a few days since.
Unfortunately i will not be sharing this.
Special day with anybody special and.
I'll be staying at home i thought i.
Would do a more non wearable look so.
Today i created this super fun glittery.
Pink inspired.
Valentine's day look with hearts that's.
Cute i don't know what else to say if.
You guys like to see how i created this.
Look just make sure you keep on watching.
To begin today i'm gonna prime my face.
Using my benefit porefessional primer as.
Always if by some miracle we do end up.
Getting a valentine's day kiss we're.
Gonna get a whole lot of sweaty and a.
Whole lot of excited the last thing you.
Want to do is sweat our makeup off the.
Foundation today i'm going to use my.
Holy grail my make up for ever ultra hd.
Foundation stick in the shade of y 315 a.
Few guys commented on my last video.
Asking my it and pre prime my nose like.
Usual and it is still my favorite trick.
But i lost my mac concealer that is used.
For it and i've been way too lazy to buy.
Any one so yeah as always i'm gonna use.
My guitar shaped eva concealer to.
Conceal and highlight my face.
I'm speeding to the basepart today.
Pretty fast you guys that see me do this.
The same exact routine literally 50.
Million times y'all know i don't really.

Eye look is super intricate so i want to.
Make sure all the focus is teaching you.
Guys how to achieve this valentine's day.

Eye fair a combination the kat von d.
Shade and light palette the morphe are 7.
Brush and the m for 35 and then i'm just.
Gonna bake my face quickly using my at.
Cody or some powder and a powder puff oh.
Well my face is baking in the oven at.
350 degrees i'm gonna leave this on for.
About 5 to 10 minutes and while that.
Bakes i would normally go ahead and do.
My brows but today i want to show you.
Guys this game that i've been loving.
Lately i've been absolutely addicted to.
Playing best fiends lately i'm sure you.
Guys have heard of it because a ton of.
Youtubers have talked about it so a.
Major shout outs bestie and source on.

Like mmm no thank you and then i.
Actually download the app and started.
Playing and then i was like oh you know.
What yes thank you.
This is so fun and not even gonna lie.
I've been playing it non-stop best.
Fiends is a free adventure puzzle game.
Where you connect objects of the same.
Color to it defeat the slugs you guys.
Follow me on snapchat you hear me talk.
All the time about like escape rooms and.
Like wanting to escape from prison one.
Day and all this weird type of stuff i.
Know i'm weird but i like thinking and.
Using strategy so this game is literally.
It's so much fun for me since it is.
February and this is a valentine's day.
Tutorial i thought this would be perfect.
To mention this entire month up until.
February 26 there will be a valentine's.
Day themes that characters and all types.
Of puzzles that you can solve and.
There's gonna be a special price on.
Valentine's day as well so make sure you.
Play it then i'm currently on at level.

Ago so i think i'm doing it pretty well.
So far.
And if you want to check it out the link.
Will be in the description below to.
Download for free like i said i've.
Literally been playing non-stop so let's.
See if you guys can beat my level.
Comment down below how far you are and.
Good luck sisters i may have got a.
Little bit distracted but at least i.
Beat the level but now that the bag is.
All done i'm gonna go ahead and just.
Wipe it off so we can move on with the.
Rest of the face just hurt my brows.
Today i'm gonna use my benefit.
Processing my brow pencil in the shade.
At number 6.
I've been doing my brows a lot more like.
Light and fluffy lately with the pencil.
As opposed to my usual anasazi at depo.
And honestly i'm kind of like loving it.
So maybe we're saying goodbye to the.
James charles brick of an eyebrow.
R.i.p she will maybe be mixed with this.
New style of brow that i've been loving.
Lately as i said i like to kind of fill.
Them in as least as possible and just.
Shape them and then i'll use the gel to.
Kind of brush the hair upwards and then.
Fill in any gaps that i have just to.
Make them look really really light.
Fluffy and like natural and then just.
Setting my eyelid in place using my.
Morphe e45 brush and some more.
Heart-shaped tape concealer and then.
Just going over with my translucent.
Powder so show off my eyes today i'm.
Going to be using my very very damaged.
Violet balls holy vera shadow palette.
I'm first gonna start off with my m4 4-1.
Dipping into a wine and dine and putting.
That in my crease as a transition color.
I'm just putting this in my crease and.
Circular motions and when i get to the.
Outer corner i'm also going to pull this.
Eyeshadow out and up in it like a.
Outward v wingy shape next i'm going to.
Grab an m4 33 on the same shade wine and.
Dine and deepen up my crease and outer v.
I'm also dragging whatever the excess.
Product is on this brush into the lower.
Lash line because we're going to have a.
Lot of stuff going on down here and then.
Taking that m4  one with no product on.
It and just blending out those edges.
I'm mexican to grab the shade a teddy.
Bear on the same brush and deepen up.
That outer corner.
Music.
Oxana take my 35 b and miami 56 to it.
Dip that into that black shade just to.
Define the very very outer part i'm.
Gonna be super gentle and light with.
This to be careful that it doesn't get.
Too dark and messy.
This look is taking a whole lot of.
Blending and for some reason my eye.
Shadow is not being a cooperative today.
I mean are we really surprised will.
There ever be a video with james charles.
Where something doesn't go wrong.
Honestly it probably not clearly it's.
Not this one.
To do a half cut crease today i'm going.
To use my m17 0-0 and this oil pink.
Shade on my lid.
I forgot my glitter glue at home classic.
James so i just use my eyelash glue and.
Some craft store glitter both things.
That are typically not safe and just did.
This half cut crease i would not.
Recommend that strategy i would.
Definitely recommend using regular glue.
And cosmetics great glitter but when.
You're me sometimes things don't always.
Work out for the lower lash line i'm.
Going back in with my m4 for one and the.
Same shade wine and dine from the violet.
Voss palette and i'm going to start to.
Blow out that bottom shadow i'm also.
Making sure to connect that pink up to.
The upper lash line exa going to grab.
Teddy bear on the m4 33 and deepen up.
That outer corner.
And then with a 562 and the black from.
The 35 b i'm going to just hug the.
Lashline.
For the lower lash that i'm going to be.
Gluing on all sorts of different styles.
Of glitter i'm going to use this really.
Pink fine glitter    litter that's a.
Little bit more chunky and then these.
Pink heart sequins.
Oh my god this is pretty i just wanna.
Have in line my upper and lower.
Waterline using my nyx jumbo eye pencil.
In black bean to make the lashes blend.
Together then i'm just going to go to.
Miami 213 in the black shape from the 35.
B just make sure there's no skin showing.
Between the waterline and the lash line.
Alright guys and that is when i all.
Complete of course obviously at minus.
The lashes i'm gonna do that the one.
Off-camera quickly to save some time.
Then we can finish up with the rest of.
The face all right there we go that is.
The finished eye look upper lashes today.
I'm gonna pop on d lily lashes in the.
Style of janice okay so i just filmed a.
Video with tana mojo and i found out.
That apparently i'm like the only person.
In human history that puts on mascara.
Then lashes so today i just did lashes.
Then i'm gonna put on mascara to blend.
Them together and that was the easiest.
And eyelash has ever gone on to my eye.
And now i'm very very angry that i did.
Not know this sooner even out of times.
That i've been putting on a lash in the.
Lid i spent like 20 minutes sitting.
There gluing it down a million times oh.
Wow i feel betrayed i feel lighter i.
Feel left out like i read all of my.
Comments and literally not a single one.
Of you who has ever commented saying oh.
James you should try to put on your.
Eyelash first and then do most secure.
Off her because it'll make your life a.
Million times easier instead of spending.
17 years bring them on for once your.
Sisters have let me diamond life.
Highlighter today i'm gonna start off.
With my anasazi moonchild palette and.
The shade pink heart using my morphe and.
501 remember you can use code james for.
10% off all morphe products and then i'm.
Gonna layer over top using my star.
Crushed minerals highlighter in the.
Shade rosy feature and you can use coda.
James for 50% off all their products i'm.
Also gonna use the same highlighter to.
Highlight the tip of my nose for lips.
Today i could be using the open liquid.
Lipstick in the shade of the kuna beach.
Never mind okay i take it back okay.
Let's try this again i'm gonna use the.
Morphe liquid lipstick in the shade.
Now.
I don't like this one either well last.
Time i'm gonna use santa anna from oprah.
Hopefully this color will be yet.
Honestly whatever at this point i give.
Up i still hate this lip so i'm gonna.
Layer the shade angeles on top at this.
Point i don't know where we're going.
With this honestly just like giving up.
But i think this is the best we're.
Probably gonna get today we're done i.
Just put on those two liquid lipsticks.
Then i added at the highlighter on top.
From star-crossed minerals and a little.
Bit of glitter.
Nobody's gonna wear this look anyways.
Somewhere just go all out and be extra.
And i'm gonna set this in place with my.
All better settings right because after.
All this i do not want this to come off.
I think urban decay is sending a message.
That they want this to come off because.
I just ran out of a setting spray oh.
Alright guys and this is the completed.
Valentine's day glam i really really.
