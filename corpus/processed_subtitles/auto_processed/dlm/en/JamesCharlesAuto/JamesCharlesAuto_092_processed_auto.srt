Hi sisters james charles - and welcome.
Back 22 channel oh my god you guys i am.
So beyond excited for today's a.
Brand-new video i just want to jump.
Right into it today's video has been.
Literally the most highly requested.
Video probably ever from you guys and.
Something that i've wanted to do for a.
Very long time as well.
Ever since i announced the palette and.
That is well it's gonna be the fastest.
Intro ever full face of makeup using.
Only my palette if you sisters know me.
You would know that i love a good at.
Competition that i never ever backed.
Down from a challenge i always go above.
And beyond sand i really really do not.
Like losing so not even gonna lie when i.
First read this comment i was a little.
Bit nervous about doing this challenge.
But after kind of looking at the full.
Palette and planning everything out in.
My head i do think that i actually will.
Be able to slay this challenge of course.
There will be a few complications along.
The way when it comes like a foundation.
And other things like that but we're.
Gonna get through them together all that.
Being said i am so excited to dive in.
And so without further ado let's unleash.
Our inner artist and do a full face of.
Makeup using only my palette.
Music.
All right you guys so to make sure that.
I sisters slay this challenge today i.
Think i'm gonna go in the same order.
It's my normal makeup routine and just.
Replace each step along the way so i.
Don't miss any and of course you guys.
Know at first i always do my foundation.
To lay down a light base now looking at.
This palette we have already run into a.
Little bit of an issue now you and i are.
Sisters so must be honest with each.
Other we all know that i'm not exactly.
The best when it comes to matching my.
Foundation there's no need to talk about.
It thanks so if i was to use one of the.
Change in the palette my options are.
Either bright white bright yellow orange.
Which happens a lot regardless and super.
Super pale none of which really seemed.
To be viable options so i posted a poll.
On my instagram story and i asked you.
Guys i said should i start off on my.
Base already on camera and just do every.
Other step after using only the pounds.
Or should i not cheat and literally just.
Scam foundation and i literally a two.
Percent vote don't she know foundation.
Won with 51% so i guess we're doing a no.
Foundation makeup look today i'm not.
Exactly sure how that is gonna work out.
I am having a pretty good skin day today.
Thank god but i am definitely very red.
So hopefully this like it calms down.
During the process of the video.
Regardless i guess we're gonna move on.
To the next step already okay so after.
Foundation we have concealer which i.
Cannot do and then after a concealer we.
Have powder which i can do but there's.
No point if i'm not actually setting.
Anything in please.
So after powder i guess were already on.
To contouring so we definitely have a.
Lot of options when it comes to a.
Bronzing but that is going to be at the.
Next step so to contour i'm gonna get.
Miami 405 brush this is that my brush.
Set and dip into the shade i think hunch.
Me might be a pretty good at contouring.
Color it is one of the only cool tone.
Browns.
In the palette so let's try that kind of.
Good okay a little more just a slight.
Chisel okay down down for this i think i.
Want to keep it pretty light when it.
Comes to the face makeup just because a.
Lot of contour and blush and highlight.
Might look a little bit strange over top.
Of my normal skin when there's no base.
Underneath to even everything out oh my.
God you guys my face actually might.
Match my.
For once okay this is already not.
Looking the best because at this shade.
Is very very cool tone but my face is.
Very very red and they were kind of.
Mending together to already make orange.
Don't even want a bronze oh maybe we'll.
Just go light lastly before i go to the.
Bronze i'm just gonna grab the e at 62.
This does come with my bracelet and it's.
The custom brush that i made and i use.
This one for and nose contouring i'm.
Just gonna grab a little bit more punch.
Me and just go right down the side of.
The bridge.
Oh god that does not look good i guess.
The good thing about a hobby foundation.
Was that i can literally just drop it.
Off if it looks stupid.
What are those oh it's my glasses marks.
You're literally kidding me people who.
Wear glasses to truly know the struggle.
Like these red marks are permanently.
Embedded into my skin forever and i've.
Been wearing these contacts all day long.
Like how rude that looks not good it's.
Okay we're gonna make it work so bronze.
Gonna grab me five to seven brush that.
Dip into the shade code james now this.
Shade is very very pigmented so what.
We're not going to do is make me look.
Orange oh too late okay oh my god you.
Guys really got me covered this whole no.
Foundation thing jesus maybe if i just.
Like really blended out it won't be oh.
That's bad oh my god no it is good about.
This though washed out i'm gonna grab my.
Makeup plate if i go like this all nice.
And chiseled doesn't look good for blush.
I'm gonna grab my efore brush and dip.
Into the shade literally which is this.
Metallic pinky peach shade this is what.
My all-time favorite shades in the.
Palette and i feel like this one is.
Getting overlooked a little bit at some.
Of the reviews that i'm seeing so i want.
To show her some love the shade is so.
What beyond beautiful and i added it to.
The palette to be a perfect kind of.
Blush shade to mix together your bronzer.
And your highlighter it is like oh my.
How obsessed she's looking up a little.
Of time i think i'm gonna lay down like.
A light coat of highlighter to just to.
Kind of get the face going so i make my.
Face a quick spritz of the crepiness at.
Settings prior they were saying.
Literally and the entire world you guys.
Need this in your lives and i'm gonna.
Grab the shade face on miami 501 this.
Comes in the brush that a little bit.
Above the brow bone as always love a.
Good glow here like can you imagine what.
It would be like to actually have like.
Good even skin and to be able to do this.
And it looked like not disgusting then a.
Little bit right down the tip of the.
Nose as well this pilot or is really.
Intense when you don't have the base.
Underneath it oh my god i'm gonna come.
Back to the base later on and see if.
There's anything that we can do to kind.
Of fix it so next time is going to be.
The brows and i'm already a little bit.
Concerned about this step i'm not even.
Going to lie my anasazi umbrellas is my.
Favorite pencil in the entire world and.
Whenever i get austin interviews if you.
Could bring three big upon us that are.
Deserted island what would they be in.
That it's always the first one that i.
Say because i literally had quite the.
Broad transformation and using any other.
Products triggers me including brow.
Powders which i absolutely hate so an.
Eye shadow is really not any different.
For the brows i'm gonna grab my m15.
Eight brush this also comes in the brush.
Set and dip into the shade t in the top.
Right hand corner this is a cold tone.
Dark brown shade and i'm going to fill.
The brows go start ways to catching the.
Tail and then drawing the bottom line.
I'm trying to keep it very very light.
Hand because i definitely do not have a.
Lot of cool tone brown options in the.
Palette and i want to be able to like.
Actually layer it up and add dimension.
So i don't have sharpie brows so to do.
That i think i pretty much only want to.
Define the tail this is actually a.
Pretty good color for my brows just.
Gonna use the end of that brush to kind.
Of blend anything in the front of the.
Brow okay come on that's not that bad.
I'm gonna try it on the other brow as.
Well so are you guys i'm literally being.
So quiet i just know that i don't really.
Have many options when it comes to.
Making this look good so i'm trying to.
Actually focus clearly makeup has no.
Rules but this is why i will never.
Understand how people do their eyebrows.
At first before anything else because.
This books literally crazy oh ready to.
Move on so moving on we have the next.
Step which is going to be of course the.
Eye shadow which is my favorite part of.
The entire routine or we get to use the.
Palette for what it's actually intended.
For it to look really good and fresh.
I decided not to cheat and do no.
Foundation in honor of you guys but when.
It comes to this i am going to cheat and.
I am going to use just a little bit of.
An eyeshadow base this one is the p.
Louise basis is literally one of the.
Best bases in the entire world i learned.
About this product from a lot of my.
Favorite international artists such as a.
Mum of mitchell and say siri mua and.
Kaleigh they're also incredibly tells it.
And it works really well for all them i.
Have had nothing but amazing results.
With this as well.
And i know a lot of you guys we're.
Concerned about the fact that i.
Recommended an eye primer or like a mac.
Paint pot this product right here is a.
Super super great alternative as well.
Gonna use a little bit of this to clean.
Up the eyebrow using the amba 410 brush.
This one it does come in at my breast.
And then with one of the flat concealer.
Brushes from the brush set this is the.
M22 for i'm just gonna grab a little bit.
More of that from the back of my hand.
And i'm going to tap on any excess and.
Use this it would just little patting.
Motions all across the eyelid just to.
Lay down a light base with a look that.
I'm going to do so since we're keeping.
It pretty neutral on the shades that.
We're using when it comes to my face.
Clearly i do want to go in and play with.
A few different colors when it comes to.
The oxbow my shadow why not let's.
Unleash my inner artist together i think.
I want to do like a sunset smokey eye no.
With a blue and purple on the lid mmm.
Yeah guys we're just gonna do that i'd.
Hope they don't look alright so just go.
Ahead and zoom do you guys get a little.
Bit more so we can focus on the eye look.
Together and make sure we get all the.
Details i'm first gonna go to miami 4 or.
5 6 brush and dip into a little bit of a.
Mix of the shades and cola and escape.
And just pack this literally right on.
That outer b i'm not gonna put too much.
On here because i have a lot of colors.
That i need to fit in this eye look.
Today and the last thing that i want is.
For it to get really really messy.
And that's better take another m 4 5 6.
Brush and dip into the shade it's single.
Which is the bright purple and i'm going.
To use this shade to diffuse out that.
Edge making sure to keep this once again.
At very very low to the eyelid because.
We have a lot of colors i'm basically.
Laying this purple right over top of.
Those two dark shades just to how to.
Diffuse the edges going back into the.
Other brush and just adding in some of.
The darkness again next we're gonna have.
4 3 3 to continue this sunset i'm gonna.
Grab the shade you're kidding.
Literally my favorite red in the entire.
World and i'm just going to buff out.
Once again that line i'm trying to go in.
With a little bit of a light hand.
Because this red is insanely pigmented.
And i still have a few more colors that.
I need to add overtop of it so i don't.
Want it to get too high up just once.
Again using those stamping and patting.
Motions to get the pigment on there.
First and then just lightly going over.
To blend it out going back in with a.
Single to make sure we don't lose that.
Purple in that blend next better gonna.
Be another m four five six and dip into.
The shade and five one eight and this is.
The bright neon orange and i'm going to.
Diffuse out the red and i'm definitely.
Taking my sweet time especially since we.
Were getting close to it the eyebrow i.
Do not want all the colors to get muddy.
And then finally just a little bit more.
Of single lastly i'm gonna go a little.
Bit of beyond an m of 514 brush and just.
Use this to buff out that final orange.
Edge so now that the eye situation is.
Finally figured out oh my god not.
Wearing foundation literally not the.
Move i think i want to do a pop of blue.
On the actual eyelid so oh i shouldn't.
Be cut the crease first i'm first gonna.
Dip into the shade acappella miami one.
To four and give it a quick spread of my.
A setting spray and i'm going to first.
Pop this right on it the outer area of.
The lid just kind of patting and.
Wiggling that shade right on there i'm.
Gonna put in probably about two halfway.
On the lid as well and bringing that.
Right up to that crease line and then.
With whatever's left i'm gonna go in and.
Lightly wiggle that brush and between.
The transition area just to kind of get.
These two to blend together i'm gonna go.
Back with my original brush that i use.
Literally first and a little bit of cola.
Just to pat over that transition just.
Make sure it's nice and smooth and then.
Without same brush i'm gonna dip into.
The shade how low which is the right.
Metallic teal shade a little bit more of.
The settings right and i'm gonna tuck.
This shade on the inner half of the.
Eyelid event of lemon together i'm just.
Gonna start topping over at that border.
With whatever is left of hello lassa.
Finally not least because why not i was.
Gonna dip into a little bit of artistry.
On my finger and i'm just gonna top this.
Right over top of my lid for the laurel.
Are the way to show off a little bit of.
You're kidding just right up against the.
Lash and then just a little bit of beet.
To blend that right out.
The little cuban e15 to browse just who.
These come with a brush set i'm gonna.
Grab a tiny little bit of ascii and use.
This finally last but not least just to.
Tuck this right up against that lash.
Line up for a little bit of dimension.
And to connect it in it to that outer.
Little wing that we created to complete.
This eye look i'm just gonna grab it why.
Not last pencil brush and dab into the.
Shade of b and i'm gonna place this kind.
Of really heavily into the inner corner.
And then with a tiny little detail brush.
This one is not even in the brush spot i.
Don't know where i even found this i'm.
Gonna dip into a mix of the shade and.
Ringly and so good give it a quick.
Little spritz and i'm going to tuck this.
Shade right on top of that yellow loving.
My shadows are too pigmented it's gonna.
Grab a little bit of b and go right over.
That just to kind of dull it down a.
Little bit never thought i would say.
That when it comes to the inner corner.
Highly gonna use that same exact mixture.
And pop a little bit onto the brow bone.
And i think finally that is what i all.
Complete oh my god you guys i don't know.
Why it that took me so long i still.
Struggle with sunset smokey eyes every.
Single time i do them i generally just.
Don't understand how some people can fit.
So many colors in such a short amount of.
Space like literally this tiny little.
Space has to have eyebrow highlight and.
Yellow and orange and red and magenta.
And purple and dark apart wall.
Look how how do you do that i don't know.
Clearly but this is looking like okay is.
It my best no is it my worst definitely.
Not so in that case i am happy and ready.
To move on to the other eye which i'm.
Now going to do off camera so you guys.
Don't have to stay here and watch me for.
Another two hours be right back all.
Right hello i am back and those are both.
Eyes all done and complete and now i am.
Definitely ready to move on there really.
Isn't a whole lot left of this look that.
I'm able to do with the palette but.
We're going to try so i think the one.
Thing that i really want to address is.
My splotchy skin as i put more add more.
And more makeup on to my actual eyes it.
Became very apparent that i was not.
Wearing any base makeup like i said i am.
Very much not used to this i wish i had.
Even skin because this look is so beyond.
Beautiful and i wish that i could rock.
This and feel confident while doing.
But i really just don't so i do want to.
Do a little bit of like covering if i.
Possibly canada what i'm gonna do is.
Grab a beauty blender that i went in the.
Sink but completely wrung out like there.
Is a little easier moisture in this and.
Different to the shade in canvas it is.
Like the pale kind of eyelid a setting.
Shade and i'm gonna put this on here and.
See if this does a neat good job oh.
We'll be doing a lot of fast oh my god.
Here we go.
Oh oh my god i literally should have.
Covered my entire face with this i.
Cannot believe that i did not try this.
Out earlier i think that i probably.
Assumed that canvas was too light for my.
Skin tone but clearly it is not and of.
Course we can always address it with.
Bronzer i don't know where my mind was.
Doing this i really should've thought of.
This as well because i've been watching.
A few reviews and what was so cold.
How did i actually saw a few different.
Girls using the kind of tube which is.
The kind of peachy banana shade as an.
Under eye setting powder for darker skin.
Tones so genius it is literally so cool.
Watching so many different people test.
Out different techniques so if you are.
Of a similar skin tone to me and you.
Happen to be doing the full face using.
Only one eyeshadow palette challenge.
Canvas is a great foundation color i.
Think just for funsies i want to add.
Some fake freckles so this look one.
Because they're really really cute and.
Two because they're gonna distract from.
My other skin that's going on so i'm.
Gonna grab a tiny little lighter brush.
This is the e30 7 and in two teeth does.
They'd be a little bit dark let's see.
Not too well you know what maybe i'll do.
A few of them entities like for the.
Darker ones let's see just placing on.
Little tiny dots everywhere to add a.
Little bit of like a sunburn effect i'm.
Gonna go over a little bit of a punch me.
And dipping into the tiniest little bit.
Of 10% off and i'm just.
Pop that right over top and it's kind of.
Like okay so that is the face pretty.
Much all complete and i guess the last.
If at all staff is going to be at the.
Lips which i'm not exactly sure how this.
Is gonna work but we're gonna try i'm.
Gonna grab an animal one two four brush.
Once again and dip into the shade mary.
Which is probably like the best nude lip.
Shade in this palette and see how oh my.
God you're kidding i will say this is.
Very hard to get a precise line this lip.
Color is gross but it's a lip color.
Maybe if i do okay i'm gonna put a.
Little bit of flash back maybe in the.
Middle kind of a flash like everywhere.
Or rather this is little bit only.
Working because my lips are so dry right.
No maybe a little shimmer will make it.
Look kind of glossy.
Music.
Is this full face using only my palette.
All complete like i said in the.
Beginning of this video going into this.
Challenge today i was a little bit.
Nervous because you guys know i go.
Bigger go home and everything and i do.
Not like to lose but once actually kind.
Of examined the entire palette and.
Figured out what i wanted to do i was a.
Lot more confident and ready to go.
That being said i am very very pleased.
And proud of the finish result today i.
Think this looks so credibly beautiful.
And it's honestly hard to tell that i.
Did this with no other products but.
Getting here was definitely not easy i.
Feel like i would have flown through.
This challenge and not how to literally.
Any issue had i just done a campus all.
Over the face first i don't know why but.
I just didn't think of it and my brain.
Literally cannot work on makeup.
Backwards i just have to have a base on.
Which is what i feel like really really.
Threw me off the contour finally and.
Blush could be a little bit better a.
Little bit sisters thought she but like.
I said if i had a base on it probably.
Won't be having that issue same thing.
With the eyebrows it didn't really have.
Anything to stick to so they look like.
Okay not the worst pearls definitely not.
The best process i've ever done on a.
Saskia sweetie i'm so sorry that i ever.
Tried you for this video as for the.
Actual eyeshadow i don't know why i was.
Sister struggling to do a sunset off cut.
Crease i do these types of looks all the.
Time but for some reason i just could.
Not blend its today that being said the.
Finish is all i think is so it'll be.
Beautiful i am in love with this eye.
Look and i think it highlights both the.
Blue shades and the warm tones on the.
Palette so incredibly beautifully i.
Definitely think that adding the frame.
Freckles were a really really great.
Touch i cannot believe that using a dark.
Brown shade like tia literally worked.
For this but i use it for any brain.
Lately and i definitely do think it.
Distracted from some of these splotchy.
Skin so really really glad i added that.
And for the lips i cannot believe that.
This even stock period definitely does.
Not look amazing would not walk out of.
The house with these lips on but that.
Being said for literally begin i shadow.
Palette not bad.
Regardless of how this finished look.
Turned out though i had so much fun.
