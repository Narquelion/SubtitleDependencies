Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel a few.
Videos ago i did a q&a and one question.
You guys asked was if there were one.
Youtuber outside of the vt road that you.
Who collab with who would it be and my.
Answer to that was shane dawson and.
Jenna marbles and today my dreams came.
True kind of there was a really crazy.
Trying to bug out on youtube right now.
We're different people try to follow and.
Recreate beauty gurus makeup tutorials.
This is started by thomas humbert who.
Tried to follow a jeffrey star makeup.
Tutorial i will link his video down.
Below he started this whole thing and.
Now it is literally blown up this.
Morning i woke up to a million tweets.
Because living legend jenna marbles.
Decided to follow a james charles makeup.
Tutorial i can die happy.
I was so absolutely honored to have.
Jenna follow one of my makeup tutorials.
I was a little bit spooked on not gonna.
Lie because she chose the valentine's.
Day look from last year i still had my.
Man but anna block eyebrows who those.
Are dark times we did not talk about any.
More on this channel but i think she.
Absolutely killed the look i'm not gonna.
Lie i was not expecting much but i.
Really think sister looked so good so.
Definitely go check out jenna's video go.
Show her at the sister love tell her i.
Sent you and for today's little surprise.
Video i thought it would be only right.
To follow the trend and recreate one of.
Jana's makeup tutorials without further.
Ado i'm gonna throw all my makeup.
Knowledge down the drain i no longer a.
Beauty guru and i'm gonna be getting.
Ready.
Using a jenna marbles makeup tutorial.
Lord help me let's get started.
Music.
There's stuff up on youtube and we.
Search the jenna marbles makeup tutorial.
Okay so we have the i tried following a.
James child link up to trail that's.
Iconic.
We also have jenna marbles drunk makeup.
Tutorial from five years ago this has 23.
Million views hello what am i didn't.
Happen tutorial to get 23 million views.
That sounds the best ever the fact that.
There's a drug to trail it's poufy a.
Little bit you guys know i here on the.
James charles channel we are sober.
Sisters but if you go like drinking.
Never experience is you before.
Music.
Okay can already tell you i'm not gonna.
Follow this first step this is not a.
Good start makeup my partner this is the.
Line okay let me see if i can find a.
Normal tutorial okay this is a makeup.
Tutorial for my vlogs for unskilled.
People and today that is what i am let's.
Try this.
I'll like i'm watching two different.
People what is going on.
Same-same okay even though this video.
Let's take its toll on a toaster oven.
She looks great so hopefully i'll be.
Able to recreate this on me today.
That is literally the team.
I feel like primer i correct me if i'm.
Wrong for many of you guys i feel like.
Primer literally does nothing like every.
Time i use a primer if anything it just.
Disrupts the foundation that's actually.
On my nose that's why i literally.
Stopped using it i only use moisturizer.
Anymore but i feel like primer is the.
Biggest gimmick in the beauty world like.
What does it even do oh my god sisters.
That we are doing a full coverage.
Vanilla cake mix makeup today good lord.
That foundation it can cover like.
Anything like that's enough to cover.
Like my scandals i don't have the exact.
Cream foundation that jenna uses but i.
Do you have the krylon tv paint stick.
Which is equally as full coverage and.
Also a cream foundation this is.
Literally what i use for drag makeup but.
I guess we're going to use this today.
With a brush oh gosh.
Guess i'm just gonna go right in and.
It's oh my god this is so full coverage.
My skin is crying oh oh my god flash.
Like mary is shaking i do not even.
Realize how light this foundation was.
Hello where is the concealer the.
Concealer not exist yet in 2011.
Oh hey i don't have that powder but i do.
Have my mac studio fix foundation which.
Is a mac pressed powder that has some.
Color to it she is scrubbing that all.
Over oh okay here we go.
Music.
No oh my god this is not true okay.
Sisters i don't know who thought love.
Either coming her marbles in the.
Background love a dual-purpose that sir.
I don't have that brush or dogs that's.
Chew on them but i do have it my morphe.
M 5 to 7 news coach james return office.
Oh i love the place that she's going.
With of all over her face okay i'm gonna.
Start off on the cheekbones like she did.
I noticed he put a lot of this in her.
Eyelid region up here and also laid.
Across her cheeks and across her nose oh.
My god i can feel the foundation on my.
Nose crying for help right now you know.
Okay well okay so she's contouring her.
Face right okay let's pause and going.
Right in at the hollows of the cheek.
Bones to really give that sunken and.
Sculpted look i like that she actually.
Described that that is definitely.
Correct placement and i always do my.
Contour in my cheeks and as well as.
Around the face as well that really.
Highlights the center of your face which.
Brings attention to it so good job.
Sister jenna that is correct.
I feel like we have reached the maximum.
Level of bronzer please yeah okay thank.
God okay you guys know i love a good.
Peach blush okay i don't have that but i.
Do have a mac blush and peaches.
Hopefully there should be a similar.
Color.
So according to like your face shape i.
Like to blend it in like with my bronzer.
A little bit okay me too i think she's.
Actually doing a really good job of.
Explaining where to place the products.
And how much to put on like how to blend.
It out that's awesome good job sister.
Jenna from seven years ago you're gonna.
Be amazed at how frigging easy and i.
Don't care oh come on i don't care well.
I'm not even put it based on my eyes cuz.
They don't like me everybody i really.
Really like this light brown color race.
Okay so let's say she has a duo palette.
Of a light light light light light brown.
And a slightly darker brown let me go.
See what i have okay so i just found.
This covergirl true naked eye shadow.
Palette it basically is like my only.
Palette that has light tans and browns.
If you guys know me you know that i.
Really don't do a lot of soft makeup so.
We're gonna make this work today so try.
And find a closer this or that just.
Really looks natural but make sure for.
Me because my hey so what say i think.
She's doing a really really good job of.
Actually explaining why she's picking.
He's tell it like she's talking about.
How she wants light matte cheeks under.
Her eyelids really bring attention to.
Her eyes i think this is actually a good.
Tutorial.
Sister jenna do you think iris.
Everywhere are quaking in this light.
Brown with this blending brush which is.
Totally not what you're supposed to use.
It for oh really.
Just about right oh god i'm gonna take.
My empire 33 and dip into this light.
Brown shade and my nudes palette and i.
Guess put it all over the eyelid with a.
Blending brush like genocide this is.
Definitely not the brush that you would.
Normally use for this i wouldn't usually.
Pick something like this a more like a.
Flat rocker brush to really get that.
Color and they're particularly good that.
Color on there but you know what we're.
Gonna just use a blending brush for.
Today and like jenna said we're gonna.
Put it all over i think this is.
Literally doing nothing because the.
Amount of bronzer have i made peace.
Right no i'm gonna take this darker.
Brown and i'm taking the same brush and.
Then clean it and do it into it knocking.
Up my crease i don't know about the.
Whole slopping method i can actually do.
My i kind of throbbing right now that.
Definitely does not feel good i'm gonna.
Stick to my windshield wiper motion but.
You do use this i looked at all you can.
Take a q-tip or whatever but i just go.
Like this.
Oh no want to touch up like your temples.
Now that you've messed them up youtube.
But i don't oh you know what i feel like.
This is a terrible joke video oh that is.
Just not what you're supposed to do as.
Painful as that was for me to do with as.
A beauty guru i am falling of course.
Jenna's tutorial i do see so many people.
Doing that when it comes to fixing up.
Their eyeshadow a really great technique.
You can do if you want to kind of clean.
It i'm gonna make it just a little bit.
More to find easy to grab a little bit.
Of concealer under beauty blender and.
Just go right and it kind of just go up.
Against that edge and really just clean.
It up doesn't do a great job of kind of.
Lightening up that area and defining a.
Little bit without ripping up all of.
Your foundation leaving a red spot was.
Just.
Spooky and horrible or sometimes if it's.
Really not looking doc odd you can take.
A powder puff or your beautyblender and.
A little bit of setting powder and just.
Go right under just like that and wipe.
It off after a little while just like.
Baking normally does and that shuttle.
Will be cleaned up and your foundation.
Will not be disrupted and completely.
Gone like it is here poeple hunt i'm a.
Big fan of gel liners this brush just.
Came with it you can use any kind of a.
Liner brush.
I'm a fan i'm gonna put this right.
Before i even start doing this i notice.
Jenna is talking at her land to get it.
Straight across while looking down at.
Her mirror to try on her liner this is.
Something that is really really common.
For people to do as well but this is.
Actually a really really bad technique.
This thing that can cause really really.
Bad eye wrinkles which obviously none of.
Us want ever gonna do a gel liner and.
You're having trouble getting it really.
Really even i would recommend getting a.
Compact mirror like this and instead of.
Kind of like looking at your mirror and.
Trying to get it straight hold your.
Mirror at a downward angle like this and.
Hold your brush upwards that'll give you.
A really easy access to your eyelid so.
You have the whole thing to look at.
Without having to stretch it which shows.
Bottom a long run right here in the.
Corner oh okay was it like this okay so.
We're doing a wing i guess as well and.
Jenna is definitely right and that when.
You draw an eyeliner weighing it you.
Definitely want to follow the natural.
Shape of your eye and jen it is true a.
Baby weighing today so it's the same.
Thing that we are going to do if i turn.
To the side this is basically hide our.
Winged eyeliner should look as you can.
See it goes right from the bottom and it.
Follows my eye right up at the shape and.
Just comes right up into a nice point.
And goes right back in to that liner.
Which is really really flattering for my.
Eye shape way too many people draw their.
Winged eyeliner going right up like that.
That i let her shape is flattering on.
Literally nobody please don't - dolly.
Music.
Can relate i love a good laugh okay.
Those look like.
Ardell demi whispies hold on whoa hello.
Worst explanation where's the glue.
Where's the tweezers she's putting this.
Lash entire lash may add on with her.
Hand even as a beauty guru who does this.
As a job for a living every single day.
I still struggle with putting on.
Eyelashes and it's one of the hardest.
Parts of makeup and she's just gonna.
Throw it on there.
Speed it up like it's nobody's business.
I don't think so sister.
Music.
Don't i actually just get that on there.
Are you kidding me okay and lashes are.
On let's go into a mascara please tell.
Me she did not just glue on a pair of.
Eyelashes about a mascara to blend them.
Together oh jenna she liturgist that.
Eyebrow in like 20 seconds my eyebrow.
Process is like 20 minutes for each.
Eyebrow okay like genocide just gonna go.
Right in follow the shape.
Music.
Music.
Tell me where that i broke does not even.
Look that bad what is going on thank god.
Thank god okay.
Whoo i can roll the best.
Okay i think that's a maybelline mascara.
But this is filmed in 2011 so i don't.
Even know if that's being unsold anymore.
I'm gonna use the maybelline big shot.
Mascara which is being sold and it's.
Good not only do i want to teach jenna.
How to do makeup but i also need to.
Teach her how to do a ton pop.
Desperately so once again there's.
Getting a helpful hint when you use.
Block file it often gives you like a.
Sultry sexy look but it does make your.
Eyes look much smaller i like to use a.
White like jenna said make sure i soak.
Really really big dress attention to.
Them and gives you like a doll like look.
But god paul john today makeup is very.
Very expensive but you can definitely.
Find it cheaper options that is four.
Swords sisters preaching the truth.
Music.
We're not doing web sick oh so i.
Described the mac lipglass.
In the shade it pleased me this is the.
Lightest pink i could find so that's it.
Wait a second where's the highlighter or.
Has a setting spray where's the setting.
Powder sister.
Okay sisters i guess we are done here.
And this is the completed look for today.
Looking at this draw beauty guru.
Standpoint if someone who does makeup.
Every single day i definitely have.
Products and techniques that i like to.
Use and definitely would have loved to.
See added to this tutorial but the whole.
Point of this video is obviously to.
Throw all my makeup knowledge out the.
Window and kind of look at this as an.
Outsider trying to follow a youtube.
Tutorial just like all of you sisters.
Out there i really don't think this.
Looks that bad and throughout jenna's.
Video i actually feel like she did a.
Really really great job of explaining.
Every single step she was doing so.
Everyone could kind of get it no matter.
What their skill level really wise.
Jenna's video actually included a lot of.
Really really great tips that beauty.
Gurus tend to skip over but that would.
Be super helpful to any beginner makeup.
Wear such as using a different brush for.
Bronzing and contouring know what.
They're not the same thing using your.
Natural eye shape as a guide for drawing.
Your winged liner one of the best tricks.
I'd ever learned using mascara to blend.
Together your falsies with your regular.
Lashes and of course the pros and cons.
Of using black and white eyeliner.
Overall i had so much fun following a.
Jenna marbles makeup tutorial today i.
Know how crazy she can be in her video.
Sometimes but i think it was really.
Really cool to see this more chill side.
Of jenna just relaxing.
