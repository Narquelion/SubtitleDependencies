Hi suze james charles here involved um.
Back to youtube channel you guys this.
Club okay she has been in the works.
Because they believe this was supposed.
To happen last year okay one halloween.
Ago 365 days ago and it did not happen.
It was my file take full responsibility.
With the time of years back there are.
Spooky scary skeletons sending shivers.
Down your spine it was halloween time.
And you guys doing how to have mikey.
Other table to do an iconic halloween.
Transformation anna and i'm just so.
Excited you guys she's literally the.
Sweetest the most talented ever on the.
Entire world it's so let me tell you.
Something sister hope i'm disappointed.
In you of all the years that you've been.
A sister yes you've never been a real.
Sister wears coloring we're turning you.
Into a nun it's like a sister and the.
Movie okay how are you the sister who.
Has never been assistant why did do it.
Not like a nun like i'm not dean done.
But like a nun look a few years ago for.
Halloween and i had a car across carved.
In 24 head upside down with blood.
But the nun is a really buff i would say.
It's a bob movie it's a decent movie but.
The character itself don't put this in.
There yeah mikey it was okay.
I do like james on a lot so i love it i.
Mean it it's not like to do this okay.
Okay we can watch it together after the.
Clock okay great papers are the way to.
Go we'll get into the video well in.
Honor of mikey's channel being called.
Glam angora as you can see right now i'm.
Very glam we're gonna transform into.
Something very core and it's gonna be.
Very very fun so if you guys want to.
Come along on this spooky makeup.
Transformation journey keep on watching.
Music.
Okay so the first thing we need to do.
Before we make you super ugly is we need.
To put teeth in your mouth and mail them.
To your party i'm already mad about this.
Nope okay my teeth are like the absolute.
Once they got on my face that i am happy.
With everything else okay we're not here.
To be pretty house dusters okay what do.
We have to do to apply these so we're.
Gonna stick them in boiling water okay.
Stick these in boiling water just look.
Like when you were singing our yeah.
Spooky retainer oh okay so she ig glam.
Taliban yes take it all off okay i'm.
Gonna be glam and we'll see you guys.
Downstairs in the kitchen in a second.
Okay so what are we doing with this hot.
Cup of water and these disgusting so.
We're pouring kalamata lastik into hot.
Water okay if you watch it us it's a lot.
Like your mug see what's happening.
That's oh yeah wow it's disappearing.
What the how does that even work it.
Turns clear when it's fully warmed and.
Then we're gonna oh my god i saw what ok.
So then once it's still hot you can bend.
It like that you push it in there and.
Then your job and you're going to gently.
Push this against your teeth and then.
Hold it there for about a minute and the.
Plastics gonna start the hardener on.
Your teeth we might need to do this a.
Couple times because it's a little.
Finicky to get the mold.
Right but once it's just right they just.
Pop right in they're gonna do the same.
Thing to the bottom one where you just.
Mold it to the arch already fixed we.
Were back and the teeth are all molded.
20s we show them or so we wear the end.
Yes okay oh okay great so um i get let's.
Are our next steps i guess okay the next.
Step is to get rid of these eyebrows.
Yeah okay great.
Oh my god my poor disgust ahab i like it.
It's dad so you can obviously cover your.
Brows the old-fashioned way with the.
Glue stick and the stuff or you can use.
Fx brow covers which are just little.
Pieces of foam latex glue it right on.
Top of your brow okay all these are just.
Gonna use a pros-aide then yeah i.
Already spilt sit on the table you done.
I've always had a major infatuation with.
Special effects makeup i think it is so.
Cool i know the basics i'm not an expert.
In any way shape or form but i can get.
To a finished product that looks.
Possible passable is what we yeah yeah.
For sure it's definitely all i aim for.
It okay well your i would say your a.
Little bit better than possible if i.
Judging based on you were fooled you.
Good that's like what movie horror.
Movies could load up a paper topic in.
The entire world to discuss and i don't.
Talk about a very often because most.
People i feel like don't like horror.
Movies which is really sad what are your.
Top favorites because i have mine and i.
Have my list memorize what are your.
Favorites as far as classics go i love.
The exorcist i think that a lot of.
People think that it's like silly now.
Cuz it doesn't hold up to the times yeah.
But at the time it scared people so bad.
That they were running out of the.
Theaters vomiting they had priests in.
The theaters because people were so.
Freaked imagine that happening today i.
Don't think that whatever happened no.
There's nothing like they kept on camera.
No the internet desensitized us to.
Everything okay i'm gonna get my list of.
Favorites no i don't want your feedback.
Okay.
My top two are probably tied between.
Hereditary and sinister and obviously.
That are very different movies.
Hereditary was one of the first movies.
That i ever saw that actually left me.
Like frightened there was not a lot of.
Jump scares the movie but i actually.
Left the theater and went home was like.
Oh well i had a little bit spooked to go.
To sleep tonight.
Like left my stomach churning and that's.
What it was it's disturbing it's a good.
Way to.
That was a good movie i love love love.
Hurts harry my next favorite as above so.
Below.
Great did you see scary stories to tell.
In the dark but i heard that the fx was.
Really good.
Phenomenal there's one theme that.
Literally it was so uncomfortable to.
Watch that i like felt like i was gonna.
Throw up but also could not take my eyes.
Off the screen so i was so intrigued by.
Both the visuals and just the thought of.
What went on to create what i was.
Watching.
So one of the stories is like this boy.
He lives on a farm then you have the.
Scarecrow he always kicks it with this.
Friend and then one day the scarecrow.
Comes to life and kills him and then.
When he kills them with the boy turns.
Into a scarecrow.
The scarecrow stabs him starts coughing.
And hay starts coming out of his mouth.
He sees his arms and like hey stars are.
Coming out of his sleeves and like his.
Finger so he turns into the scarecrow.
Bunny like it's literally like.
Suffocating out hey and there's like.
Vines and like oh my god literally just.
Thinking about it make me feel.
Uncomfortable but they did it so it was.
Insane to watch so now unless we were in.
A powder oh thank you can i make a.
Confession i'm awful at scar wax we all.
Are it's just the nature of the beast.
Are you serious yeah it's very hard to.
Work with but impossible i literally.
Thought i was just like incompetent and.
Couldn't figure out the right math you.
Know it's hard to work with but for.
Something like what we're doing today if.
We can get it to work it is our best.
Shot at it looking great it's a great.
Out of kit option guidance its.
Difficulties there's a couple tricks.
That make it easier one of which is.
Putting prosy down first oh hasn't it.
Has something to stick to.
Okay right now okay and the other thing.
You can do to make it easier is you need.
A vaseline uh-huh so that it doesn't.
Stick to your hands.
So you grease up your hands first and.
Then you.
The nose and scar wax and then it's.
Easier to use oh my god wow i'm changing.
Yeah that does actually feel like it.
Would be a major help every time that.
I've ever had to use it just molds to my.
Fingers and you start sticking and then.
You can't achieve anything.
Yes what is your favorite transformation.
That you have her done i turned myself.
Into a realistic or ursula last.
Halloween oh okay i think i remember.
That video she was cute i'm gonna push.
On your nose a little bit but let me.
Know if i hurt you no i'm not gonna stop.
You know what.
The mona lisa wasn't done in a day okay.
My nose is like the one thing my face.
That i used to be really really insecure.
About but thank you hey hey did when i.
First heard you make it because i could.
Not figure out how to contour it for the.
Life of me and i thought it was so ugly.
Plus you're young i mean honestly i feel.
Like people grow into their face and.
Their noses yeah there's probably melts.
In there no it's just scar wax but it.
Looks like boogers this noses everything.
So i'm just making sure i get it right.
Applause.
That's really accurate i feel like you.
Say that's your nose and if you disagree.
Oh well okay so our just powdering this.
As well using 501 for this interesting.
Choice choice great for fx to not just.
Clam promo pick it up at your local.
Murphy store today or murphy calm yes.
7 she actually does have the.
Brush that with her that is really cute.
I also oh your legend do you actually.
Like using it i usually use a mini.
Palette that's too late all right let's.
Go owen okay so now we're just gonna.
Play a light base layer right so just.
Wait oliver yeah pretty much.
Great and luckily her foundation there's.
A little splotchy she's not a beauty.
Guru there's like ever like a little.
Highlight on the cheekbone thank you i.
Bring it up and bring attention to the.
Face you know mm-hmm.
I'm gonna start stippling your face with.
Some green okay and browns and tans.
Because her face has got some texture.
And using a sponge like this is good cuz.
It's automatic - okay i should turn this.
For full rekkles but not this color i.
Literally use an fx punished for a faux.
Freckle tutorial from like years really.
That's so cool you know what you kind of.
Look like be really careful what you're.
About to say right now you kind of look.
Like when you know you've seen a statue.
That a bird is pooped on a lot of times.
Yeah okay i'm gonna need you a black eye.
Great pretty margin yes like live on.
Camera the drama which also go crazy.
About that one oh you want to just stage.
It no yeah cuz that's what she's got.
Going on she's got a very messy intense.
Smoky eye okay a beauty guru for sure.
For sure.
When's the last time someone made you.
Ugly this morning lois oh my god.
Only the lawson that i got transformed.
For like the beauty convention video i.
Don't really have a lot of people do my.
Makeup kind of period let alone.
Special-effects stuff yeah this is like.
My second time i are having special.
Effects like apply it to my face i think.
Yeah mikey what are your favorite ways.
To stay inspired for actual halloween.
Looks what i tend to do is i think of.
Something that i just really like like a.
Movie that i really like or show or a.
Character and then i try to think of.
Some kind of twist to put on it or.
Whether it's like a gender bender or.
It's a glam thing and i put an fx twist.
On it and like that or just if all else.
Fails pick a really common costumer.
Character and then some.
This year for halloween i was feeling a.
Little and inspired i found this really.
Beautiful pirate dress mmm i'm just.
Gonna be a zombie pirate love bob he's a.
Little too spooky from the new what davy.
Jones likes more people mini pallet.
Perfect for clamming on the go including.
All the we make up now i'm gonna give.

Bit of detailing and then i think it's.
Gonna be about time for accessories just.
As he walk clacking cream paint yeah bit.
Of things okay you just happened with.

That's kind of the secret to veins is if.
