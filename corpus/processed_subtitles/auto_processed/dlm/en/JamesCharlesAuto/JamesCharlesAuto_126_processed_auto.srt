My sister my sister's james charles here.
And welcome back to my youtube channel.
Music.
Cutting straight to the point as you can.
See from the title down below and that.
Amazing intro clip today's video is.
Going to be reviewing the brand new at.
K'kaw kim kardashian-west beauty line i.
Have been a huge fan of kim kardashian.
For a very very long time now i think.
She is so beautiful.
So amazing and so talented and yes i do.
Say talented because of her girls of.
What you think about her she turned one.
Little video into a billion dollar.
Empire her and her family they are by.
Far the most famous family in the entire.
World and i respect their business.
Mindset so freaking much they're.
Absolute geniuses and such as i do love.
Kim whoever at that being said she did.
Just released a beauty line i am a.
Beauty guru and that means today's video.
Is going to be a review and it is gonna.
Be completely and brutally honest no one.
Is safe not even sister kim alright i'm.
Not rambling without further ado let's.
Go ahead and get on with the video.
Alright so before we actually hop in and.
Test out the contour six i do want to.
Apply a little bit of a base i was just.
Watching the beauty tutorials on at.
K'kaw calm with kim and mario and kim.
Was definitely wearing a little bit of a.
Base when mario did her makeup just for.
A quick light based i'm gonna go ahead.
And play the giorgio armani luminous sub.
Foundation in the shade 3.5 you guys.
Know if you follow me on santa this is.
Actually not my favorite foundation i've.
Not had the best experience of this but.
I do know kim loves this and i want to.
Do my best to recreate her look as much.
As possible.
And i'm also just going to quickly.
Define my brows using my anasazi.
Eyebrows in the shade medium brown just.
To give a little bit more shape to my.
Face.
All right so now that the base is all on.
And i'm looking a little bit less pimply.
And red let's go ahead and move on and.
Test out these contour sticks looking at.
The k'kaw beauty website right now there.
Are four different sets that launched.
And they are the cream contour.
Highlighting kits they're all sold out.
So major congrats in camp but when they.
Were sold they did launch for $45 each.
So for $45 you're actually getting two.
Different shades of contour stick two.
Different highlighters one being matte.
And one being summery and a dual ended.
Brush one being a kabuki brush and one.
Being like a little sponge on the end so.
Honestly from $45 you're getting six.
Things now i obviously have not with.
These on my face yet so i cannot really.
Tell you if it's worth it.
But for the number of things are kidding.
And the price definitely a pretty good.
Deal now the kids do come in four.
Different shades being light medium dark.
And deep dark now four shades may not.
Seem like a lot but being at the actual.
Event yesterday and seeing them all in.
Person it goes from a really really.
Light to deep dark and trusted the deep.
Dark was actually pretty dark so that is.
So awesome that kim is not forgetting.
About all the dark girls out there.
Because honestly they exist i have been.
Deciding between a light and medium but.
For today's video i think i'm gonna be.
Actually using the medium kit y'all know.
That i do like being a little bit more.
Bronzed and we're not trying to have.
Another flashback mary moment so i'm.
Gonna be using the medium camp for today.
I'm gonna open up medium in just a.
Second but that does leave me with light.
Dark and deep dark to use and less.
Virile i am definitely not gonna be.
Using these two so i don't think want to.
Give them away to you guys because they.
Did sell out super fast so if anybody.
One of these it wasn't able to get their.
Hands on them make sure you get this.
Video a big thumbs up down below and.
Then leave me a comment and i will.
Definitely be picking a winner on.
Monday's video to give these kits away.
For you guys alright so let's go ahead.
And open up the medium set and honestly.
Living through this packaging the new to.
Plastic bag is really really cute to be.
Honest i really really like it oh oh my.
God okay so the products actually come.
In an airtight sealed package as well.
Which is super awesome means they're.
Going to be fresh and definitely not.
Like damaged by the mail or anything so.
That is amazing love her and don't love.
The fact that i forgot to bring a pair.
Of scissors in okay.
So okay so as promised this that comes.
With two highlighting in contour six and.
Then a a brush as well so let's go ahead.
And put these into at the test first and.
Things again the packaging is super cute.
This is super cute this is also a lot.
Smaller than i expected - looking at the.
Instagram post i thought this is gonna.
Be a whole lot bigger like i was.
Thinking like m-43 nine morphe saw a.
Kabuki brush but i was definitely wrong.
So i'm definitely curious to see how.
This is actually gonna work on the face.
But i'm not gonna judge until we try.
Obviously so like i said i already have.
A light base to foundation on so the.
First thing i want to do is go into the.
Highlighting stick and i'm gonna open up.
This end cracked with the matte.
Highlighting shade and i'm gonna use.
This under the eyes just to brighten up.
The high points of my face so i guess.
I'm just gonna go right and use like a.
Normal concealer oh okay this is much.
Softer than i was expecting.
Oh my god it was really really good this.
Form is honestly going on really really.
Nicely i'm just putting in all the high.
Points my face when i only put my.
Concealer and then i'm just gonna try to.
Blend it in with the actual sponge to.
See how it actually it blends together.
Rather the product is all and i'm just.
Gonna use the sponge to blend it and but.
Similar to a beauty blender i definitely.
Want to wet it so i'm just gonna spritz.
It using my tarte.
Ready set radiant skin mist just to get.
It a little wet.
We're then just gonna go ahead and blend.
Her in okay woah so let me get this.
Close up this sponge definitely takes.
Off a lot of the products like i don't.
Know if you can see actually on camera.
But my skin is definitely showing.
Thinners i don't know about this but i.
Think i wanted to have my face using the.
Sponge on the end of the brush and then.
The other half using of my beauty.
Blender oh good idea james so then we.
Can see how they actually compare.
Because i want to give the product a.
Fair chance i just went ahead and i.
Apply it more matte highlighter to the.
Other side of my face that i use the.
Sponge on this is definitely a major.
Fail for me it's picking up a lot of the.
Product and it's just not letting out.
Very very nicely but i haven't used the.
Kabuki brush store and i get to this.
When we get to the contour but this bomb.
Is definitely not my favorite i am gonna.
Go ahead and use my beauty blender just.
To blend everything else out though.
Because i want to get the product a fair.
Chance you haven't even gotten to see.
What it looks like yet so let's go ahead.
And wonder out all right there we go was.
So much better oh my god.
When in doubt beauty blend it out.
Alright so once that is all blended up.
It is definitely looking really really.
Beautiful on the skin i'm thinking that.
This was probably like a medium type.
Cover.
It definitely like even everything out.
And actually did a pretty good job of.
Covering my under-eye bags as well but.
It definitely is like not full coverage.
Because i can still see my skin.
Underneath it but i do like that so this.
Is definitely a pretty good product so.
Far definitely does not like being the.
Sponge but i'm glad we went in with the.
Beauty blender because this is pretty.
Bomb well get back to the shimmer end of.
The highlighting sec towards the end of.
The video but let's move on with the.
Contour so opening up the stick we have.
A light contour end and a darker contour.
And this is the medium stick keep in.
Mind and in the video that kim posted.
She said she likes to use the lighter.
End of the stick to do like her nose.
Contour and sometimes even like.
Eyeshadow under and lower but she likes.
To use the darker stick to contour the.
Rest of her face so we're gonna do the.
Exact same thing today i'm first gonna.
Use the lighter end of the stick to it.
Snatch my nose i would like to contour.
The bottom window so it kind of like.
Lifts it up and just gives it a little.
Bit of like a cute doll like a fact and.
You guys know that i definitely love a.
Good at pinch nose i'm putting these.
Lines pretty close together.
Okay i'm not just realizing that i.
Happen to use the darker under the.
Second way nose contour and not the.
Lighter atoms imagine if i like actually.
Paid attention took my time on something.
For three seconds okay okay so moving on.
Looks fun with the contour and i'm first.
Gonna use the lighter end of the stick.
It's almost like a bronzer so just gonna.
Put this in the hollows that only two.
Brings pretty far up as well on both.
Sides and i'm just placing this right.
Underneath my cheekbone to really lift.
It up and chisel it out and i'm also.
Gonna grab this lighter shaded i'm gonna.
Put it right on the forehead because.
Y'all know that i hate my look as short.
And small as possible next going back.
Into the darker and i'm going to use.
This to really contour out the deepest.
Point that liam8 the very outside edge.
Of the forehead and then the very very.
Bottom of the cheekbones as well as the.
Going to really.
All right so like i said this sponge was.
Definitely not my favorite but the.
Kabuki end is still here so they only.
Want to give this a shot and test it out.
With the contour.
I'm not really sure who in their right.
Mind would ever contour their nose using.
Computers but that really did not do.
That out of a job of blending it oh i am.
Gonna completely go back in with that i.
Definitely dip it a lot of contour as.
Well so i am gonna go back into once.
Again with the highlighting stick.
Underneath just to redefine it a little.
Bit oh my god yeah when you use the.
Beauty blender this literally blends out.
So nice and evenly like this looks so.
Freakin good okay so once this is all.
Blended out this honestly does look.
Really really really pretty similar to.
The highlighting stick the contour stick.
Formula is bomb it blends out so.
Beautifully and looks really really.
Natural on the skin which i love.
Definitely not full coverage but enough.
Coverage to the point where like you get.
The color there and it makes a beautiful.
Impact ashley's like a buki brush it's.
Not bad i am someone who never ever uses.
Brushes to blend out creams or.
Foundations i'm just not the type of.
Artist i really have never understand.
When people do just because i feel like.
Kabuki brushes do always rub a.
Foundation it kind of makes things look.
Uneven that being said this did one out.
Really really nicely it honestly was not.
Really rubbing off the foundation it.
Just went on really really beautifully.
It applied nicely but i did have to.
Really work at it so i kind of like do a.
Mixture of windshield wiper motions and.
Topping to make sure i wasn't lifting.
Anything up but once it was applied it.
Was definitely applied and looked nice.
I'm just really not a brush type of.
Person but you might be so definitely.
Check this out it's not bad this on the.
Other hand it's not great all right so.
Now that all the countries it's all.
Complete let's go ahead and get deep.
Glow on so for this we're gonna use.
These shimmery pearl the highlighting.
Stick obviously let's go ahead and do a.
Little swatch on the hand.
Oh it actually looks really really.
Pretty that was like a very very subtle.
Not the lion dink low but that's.
Definitely what kim was going for when.
She was talking about this yesterday.
Definitely just like a glow from with.
Anna but let's see how she applies on.
The face i need to let pop her on in the.
Inner corners on the courts i have been.
Loving putting a little bit of how.
They're up here recently - for that like.
To e4 hand block and then also on the.
Cheekbone and then i'll just with you my.
Beauty butter and lately a blend this.
Out okay not bad as you can see it's.
Definitely pretty it's not blinding by.
Any means but i actually really really.
Like this now don't get me wrong you.
Guys know i love i've got a blinding.
Highlight all the time but i think this.
Product is really really good for just.
Like the everyday person who just wants.
To like look really moisturized radiant.
Like glowing from within but doesn't.
Wanna look like they have 54 different.
Pounds of like metallic highlighting.
Glow pigment all over their face like i.
Said i haven't fallen camp for a very.
Very long time and we all know she used.
To pack on the makeup like full be full.
Contour full eye shadow glam highlight.
To the gods but more recently she's been.
Rocking like the very very dewy natural.
Just moisturize skin look and i think.
She looks so beyond beautiful so this.
Set is definitely like her new makeup.
Style packed into one set and i really.
Like that alright so now that all the.
Products are locked in and we're looking.
Nice and snatched in the video with kim.
Mario definitely recommended using a.
Light coat of setting powder just to set.
Everything in place and actually so.
Beyond stuff right now because i.
Completely forgot about the fact that.
There is not an ounce of powder on my.
Face yet this is literally all liquid.
Foundation and then cream products.
Overtop but you guys know that i.
Definitely love packing on the powder a.
Lot but there's literally no powder on.
My face in this books it's so beautiful.
Like there's no creasing it just looks.
Natural i'm honestly living for it oh my.
God i'm just gonna do the lightest.
Dusting.
Just so if i touch my face it doesn't.
Like come right off or anything all.
Right so that is the base all complete.
I'm honestly really really liking how.
This looks so far and last but finally.
Not least in the videos kim said she.
Does use these for her eye shadow as.
Well so why not just try something out.
Let's just take a little bit from there.
I don't have anywhere to go might as.
Well give it a shot.
Dropping the lighter under the condo sec.
I'm just gonna place this right on the.
Eyelid now nervous gonna use my fingers.
To literally lightly blend this down and.
Then grabbing the darker and i'm gonna.
Go in the inner and outer corners to.
Kind of create a defined halo eye type.
Of of that and then once again just.
Having my fingers to it lightly blend it.
Out and then for a pop i'm gonna grab.
The shimmery highlighter and i'm gonna.
Place it on the center of okay wow we.
Literally just created a bronzy halo eye.
And the matter of like two minutes and.
Honestly it does not look half bad i'm.
Gonna go ahead and i'm gonna lock my.
Face in place using the urban decay all.
Nighter setting spray - the finished.
Look.
All right so let's go ahead and talk.
About these products all right so once.
Again the k'kaw beauty hiding contouring.
Cream set comes with two dual ended.
Contour six and another dual ended brush.
And sponge contraption thingy as for the.
Holiday and contouring sticks they.
Definitely have like a medium level of.
Coverage they do a good job of like.
Evening everything out and just giving a.
Nice little defining moment but they are.
Overpowering to the point where you're.
Like full coverage hiding impuls acne.
And stuff like that you can still see.
Your natural skin underneath which i.
Personally like if you are a full.
Coverage type of person you can.
Definitely layer and build it up but.
Regardless they're bomb as for this.
Sister right here this was definitely.
More of a miss for me i'd really didn't.
Like the sponge it's definitely pretty.
Dense and i just was like it didn't do.
That great of a job of really blending.
Off the product i felt as though it was.
Really removing the product rather than.
Actually blending it and that's.
Obviously never what we want is was a.
Kabuki brush and it actually went on a.
Very braid nicely i definitely was being.
Really really careful and had to work on.
It a little bit more but when i was.
Doing it this down.
Did a really great job of just flooding.
Up the product evenly and smoothly.
Without ripping off any of the.
Foundation which is really really great.
Because i definitely have a personal.
Vendetta against using brushes for.
Foundations but this obviously did a.
Really really great job i definitely.
Loved using the beauty blender to blend.
These out it just did so much of a.
Better job but this definitely is not.
Bad by any means i just really did like.
The sponge and i'm not really a brush.
Person but it's really not bad and that.
Even being said obviously it's her first.
Launch her first collection these.
Products are brand spanking new so it's.
Not like everything's gonna be perfect.
On the first try let's be real look at.
Sister kylie for example so many things.
Went wrong on the first launch but now.
After many many launches and new.
Products she arguably has some of the.
Best on the market so i definitely it's.
Gonna take a lot of launches and stuff.
To kim to get everything perfect but.
Definitely a really really great star do.
I think this collection is worth.
Checking out for $45 absolutely even if.
You exclude the blending tool you're.
Still getting four different shades of.
Highlighting and contouring sticks for.
Only $45 i think that is so bob.
Especially being associated with a.
Celebrity name like kim kardashian.
You're definitely gonna want to check.
