Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel for.
Today today we have a very very very.
Special announcement that i literally.
Have been waiting at three years to make.
Oh my god i could not believe this day.
Has finally come but i am so pumped it.
Is not even i don't like this video too.
Long sword is gonna jump right into.
Things i'm going to be filming executive.
Producing and also hosting my very own.
Beauty competition show and you guys are.
Going to be a part of it as you guys.
Know i started in youtube around four.
Years ago now and over the last four.
Years we put out some really amazing.
Videos together let's be real you guys.
Do i have such a huge love for.
Production and just going above and.
Beyond with every single of my videos.
And this what i'm about to talk to you.
Guys about is definitely not because.
We're about to take beauty content i.
Know okay you take beauty content and.
Blow it out to a place that has never.
Been done before as a kid growing up a.
Reality competition show so far.
Literally it's the only thing that i.
Watch on tv and i find being honest you.
Guys there still to this day at my.
Guilty pleasure and when i first started.
Getting into makeup and social media one.
Of my biggest goals that i set for.
Myself was to have my very own a.
Competition show one day three years ago.
When i first moved to la i remember.
Spending one morning sitting in my.
Downtown apartment and creating a full.
Notes app document on my phone and.
Planning out a full concept for a makeup.
Competition ciao i came up with the name.
Of the description literally every.
Single challenge that i wanted these.
Contestants to go through literally.
Guest judges as well like i was a fully.
Ready to go at this point but i had.
Never produced anything like that before.
I barely even knew how to use my camera.
And my lights at the time and an id like.
That honestly just felt a little bit.
Impossible so it just sat in my phone.
For literally three years but i had a.
Really long talk to my team about what i.
Wanted to do to keep myself inspired and.
I brought up the idea of doing it the.
Reality show and still felt like it was.
Going to be impossible but a few months.
Later after a lot of different.
Brainstorming sessions a lot of.
Different meetings with a lot of.
Different people with a lot of different.
Companies after a lot of different phone.
Calls and a lot of different sleepless.
Nights it's becoming a reality and the.
Impossible it's about to become possible.
Let's talk about it.
Music.
When we started talking about actually.
Making the show a reality the most.
Important part to me by far was that it.
Was authentic and that it was by.
Creators for creators and it showed an.
Accurate depiction of the beauty.
Community and what it actually takes to.
Be an influencer and it was very.
Important to me that i was able to have.
A say every single step of the way and.
Also get my hands dirty too i really.
Wanted to be involved in the last thing.
That i wanted was to have some like.
Trillion-dollar sad that i just showed.
Up to every single day with fall and.
Hair and makeup and glam already done.
And to shoot and call it a day that is.
Not me that has never been me and that.
Will not be the show either and getting.
Into that level i was honestly a little.
Bit scared because that like feels like.
A lot to ask for but i am i'm so.
Grateful that i found the dream team.
To make that a reality and to have it.
Hosted right here on youtube.
We'll be partnering with a brian graydon.
Media for the actual production and i.
Guess we've got around about the show.
