Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel.
Jumping right to the point because.
Today's video is probably going to be.
Very long and talkative but we're going.
To be doing a full review of the brand.
New tart shape tape foundation there's.
Been so much controversy and drama.
Regarding this launched and i really.
Wasn't sure if it was my position or.
Place to be talking about it however so.
Many of you guys asked for a full.
Interview of the actual product and i.
Definitely want to talk about the launch.
Because let's be real this is definitely.
Not tarts best move there are a lot of.
Problems with this particular launch.
That we will get into in a few short.
Seconds i am an influencer that's been.
Blessed with a very very large platform.
And i definitely want to use my voice.
For good and i believe this launch was.
Definitely not good so i want to talk.
About it with you guys without further.
Ado let's jump right into the review of.
The tarte safety foundation's just for a.
Quick little backstory in case you have.
No idea what's going on here at the very.
End of 2016.
Tarte cosmetics released a concealer.
Called shave tape it was picked up by.
Both beauty gurus and consumers from all.
Around the world who quickly fell in.
Love with it for its full coverage.
Easily blendable formula and by the end.
Of 2017 it was the world's number one.
Best-selling concealer a few weeks ago.
Out of literally nowhere tarte pulses.
That the shaved hip concealer was going.
To be made into a tarte shaped ape.
Foundation and the world was a literal a.
Shock i live in california and i've.
Never actually experienced a real-life.
Earthquake since i moved here but i.
Swear to god i think that on that day.
That this foundation was announced i.
Could feel the ground moving just a.
Little bit from everybody jumping up and.
Down from excitement including myself i.
Was so excited and so ready for this if.
You were a true sister you know that i.
Literally use a shave tape in every.
Single video it is like the staple of my.
Makeup routine so i was so ready for.
This foundation launch and so is.
Everybody else and told this picture was.
Posted this photo has since been deleted.
From tarts instagram page but i remember.
When they posted this my mouth literally.
Dropped to the floor there's absolutely.
No other word to describe this other.
Than embarrassing tart release two.
Different formulas of this foundation.
For different skin types a matte version.
And a hydrating version we'll be testing.
Out both in a few short minutes but each.
Version came with 15 different shades.
Now even though 15 shades isn't a lot.
There can very easily be a full and.
Beautiful.
From very very light to a very very dark.
The undertones might not be the best in.
All them but at least there would be a.
Full-on gradient so most people could.
Find their skin tone if you look at the.
Photo that tarte posted however this.
Gradient that i'm talking about is.
Nowhere in sight in the map version.
There is literally 10 light shades 3.
Borderline medium shades or like light.
Medium shades and then 2 dark shades.
Just slapped right on at the end and the.
Hydrating one is even worse with.
Literally 13 light shades and then the.
Biggest jump i've ever seen in a.
Foundation line and then at just two.
Dark shades at the end just looking at.
The swatches again on my phone i think i.
Could probably wear shades number 2 3 4.
5 6 7 8 9 10 and maybe even shade number.
11 if i had a tan and get away with it.
Matching literally the person's arm who.
These foundations is swatch on it does.
Not even have a shade match for them.
Hello it is 2018 and i just cannot wrap.
My head around how this launch even.
Passed in the first place like whoever.
Put the stamp of approval on this i just.
Want to talk not only is a launch like.
This racist but it's just really really.
Stupid morals aside and from a business.
Standpoint women of color equate for.
Eighty percent of all money going into.
The beauty industry but for some reason.
They are still overlooked the lack of.
Inclusion is a lose-lose situation.
Because you look dumb and now you're.
Losing money get it together.
As a makeup artist who happens to be why.
I definitely recognize that privilege in.
This situation i know that i can walk.
Into sephora and find at least 10.
Different foundation lines that will.
Have a perfect match for my skin tone.
But so many people of color cannot say.
The same thing i just cannot imagine.
What it would feel like to be forgotten.
About like that and to be a person of.
Color and to be so excited for a launch.
Like this and then to see the shade.
Range launched and just feel completely.
Excluded and to know that there is.
Nothing even close to your skin tone.
Since all the drama and controversy has.
Started at tarte has come on said that.
They're launching five additional shades.
To each line but even those shades are.
All really really dark the line would.
Still be predominantly lighter shades.
And we haven't even seen the five.
Additional colors yet so literally if.
Four of them could still be lighter.
Colors at this point they're like six.
Colors that all look exactly the same so.
Might as well just add four more this.
Announcement came with the classic.
Respond.
There are a lot of shades still in the.
Works that are taking a lot of our time.
And a lot of money but we were so.
Excited about these so we just wanted to.
Get them out ahead of time for you guys.
They're definitely not wrong in the.
Sense that developing complexion.
Products is a timely and expensive.
Process but heart takes influencers on.
Huge brand trips all the time and shave.
Tape is the world's number one best.
Selling concealer and at twenty dollars.
A pop we know y'all got money and as.
Consumers we have plenty of time we all.
Have our favorite foundations that we.
Know and love and use every single day.
And nobody was even excited about this.
Launch until it was announced just a few.
Weeks ago tart really easily could have.
Worked on perfecting their shade range.
To be a fully inclusive over the next.
Few months and then launch them all.
Together at once we've already waited.
For over a year for this foundation to.
Launch we could wait a few more months.
If that means everybody would be able to.
Try it out simply put people of color.
Should not be an afterthought i want to.
Make it very clear that the point of.
This video is not to bash tar i'm.
Definitely someone in the past who has.
Also come under fire for racial things.
But i can tell you firsthand that the.
Way to fight ignorant is not through.
Actually fighting it it's through.
Education hopefully by myself other.
Beauty influencers and the thousands of.
Customers speaking up and using their.
Voice for good about this issue.
Tark realizes what they did was very.
Very wrong and they'll work in the.
Future to be a much more inclusive and.
Diverse brand i am a makeup channel and.
The whole point of doing a review is to.
Test out an actual makeup product i will.
Be putting this foundation on my skin.
Today and seeing how it looks how it.
Wears and how it feels but no matter.
What the results of this review are i.
Want you to know that i do not support.
This foundation i'm gonna wear this once.
And i will not feature the tart shaped a.
Foundation again on my channel unless.
The shade range is massively expanded.
Now that i have all my thoughts and.
Opinions on the table let's go ahead and.
See what the real tia is on the.
Foundation so as i said before tarte.
Launched two different formulas each.
With 15 different shades a match formula.
And a more hydrating formula now these.
Foundations retail for $39 each and each.
Come with 30 milliliters or one fluid.
Ounce of product which is honestly.
Average and very very comparable to many.
Of the other most popular foundations on.
The market thar sent over three.
Different shades that they thought would.
Match me best in a pr package but i.
Wasn't sure if these were glia and pr so.
I actually ordered them on.
As well so i have four different shades.
To try out for today and see which one.
Matches me best.
This is lightmedium honey this is fair.
Light neutral a little bit light for me.
I think flashlights mary is shaking this.
Is light neutral and this is light.
Medium neutral looking at all four of.
These colors completely dried down i'm.
Gonna go with light neutral as my shade.
Today i'm gonna go ahead and apply it.
The matte foundation to the left side of.
My face just like always it has a doe.
Foot applicator similar to shave tape.
Which i actually honestly really really.
Like for a foundation.
I definitely been having some skin.
Issues recently and shay tape is very.
Known for being a full coverage so.
Hopefully that'll reign true with this.
Foundation because lord knows we could.
Use some coverage right now i'm just.
Gonna blend the matte foundation in.
Using my normal beauty blender thar sent.
Over their brand new blending sponge and.
Also this brush to blend the foundation.
In but i personally can really not stand.
When brands do that i definitely should.
Not have to spend extra money on.
Products just to blend in and use my.
Foundation.
Okay well that's actually dried down are.
Really really fast it's not even like.
Blending in that easily.
Music.
This foundation definitely oxidizes a.
Little bit i think because as you can.
See when i'm applying it i just applied.
A little bit more over my beard area for.
Some more coverage it definitely goes on.
Way lighter than it dries down up here.
Interesting looking in the mirror and.
Honestly underwhelmed my skin looks fine.
It definitely did a really good job of.
Evening everything out it is very very.
Full coverage light the claim says which.
Is great but i feel like i was like.
Really ready to just be shuck out of my.
Mind with this foundation because shave.
Tape let's be real literally change to.
Makeup game for so many people including.
Myself but this just feels like a normal.
Everyday foundation to me okay woah.
Touching my face the foundation is.
Already almost completely dry i feel.
Like i might not even need to start this.
With translucent setting powder i'm.
Spooked mcgoofy.
I can already tell you that this.
Foundation is probably not gonna be.
Ideal for people with a very very dry.
Skin i have oily skin and the fact that.
This still dry down is a little bit.
Alarming but there is still the.
Hydrating formula which does not write.
Down as much has a light to medium.
Coverage finish and contains hyaluronic.
Acid for those of you guys who want to.
Have a more moisturize foundation brace.
I know i def.
Love a go to do a skin look and this.
Might be a little bit better for those.
You guys who have dry skin so i'm gonna.
Grab this same exact shade light neutral.
And apply that to the right side of my.
Face okay wow so even just applying this.
Foundation it definitely has a way.
Different consistency i would say that.
The matte foundation honestly feels a.
Lot like the regular shave tape.
Concealer it definitely has a very very.
Thick consistency that we're all used to.
But i would say that the hydrating.
Formula it's more of like a gel  watery.
Type formula it definitely feels more.
Lightweight oh my god the color.
Difference.
Flashback mary says hi are you kidding.
What oh my god.
I'm gonna blend this side out as well.
Using a beauty blender this one.
Definitely does have a more hydrating.
Consistency my skin definitely does look.
A little bit more dewy a little bit more.
Radiant i feel like they're probably.
Going for a your skin about better type.
Of foundation my skin tone is even out a.
Little bit but you can definitely still.
See my natural skin it coming through.
From underneath i actually do not like.
How my skin looks on the hydrated side.
And all right now i feel like the.
Texture is very very intense i can very.
Much see all my pores in this region and.
As well as my acne on my forehead is.
Looking not the best that's for sure.
Since this is both a shave tape and a.
Foundation review i feel like it would.
Only be right to use the same tape.
Concealer like normal to finish off my.
Base today i'm gonna apply this just as.
Normal and all the high points in my.
Face.
And i'm using the shade light sand okay.
Well this is actually really hard to.
Blend on the matte side this foundation.
Definitely did not lie when it says it.
Dries down.
Music.
Now that concealers all blended out i'm.
Just gonna powder as always using my.
Laura mercier translucent setting powder.
And i'm gonna first start off by packing.
That underneath my eyes on both sides.
And then just going over my nose because.
Lord knows that that gets pretty oily.
And wearing a hydrating foundation has.
Me a little bit scared at this point i'm.
Also gonna plop that right in the middle.
Of my forehead days to everything in.
Place and make sure i don't get any.
Creases and then just use the excess on.
The rest of my face it's just to lock.
Everything in place okay guys so that is.
The foundation all of height and.
Completely set in place i will say.
Looking in the mirror the two sides now.
Look almost exactly identical there was.
Clearly a huge difference when applying.
This side dry down matte real quick and.
The side was very very hydrated but with.
The addition of powder they look really.
Really similar.
Who knows that may change throughout the.
Next few hours during wearing it this.
Side may wear down up much much quicker.
But i really have no idea we're gonna.
Have to find out all that being said i'm.
Gonna go ahead and finish the rest my.
Makeup off camera and i'll be right back.
To show you guys the finished look and.
My final thoughts all right sisters.
Hello i am back it has been about three.
Hours three hours now since i last left.
You guys i finished up my makeup clearly.
As you can see i went a little bit crazy.
With my look today but i honestly love.
How this turned out i'm not going to.
Play with color in so long and this look.
Is literally stunning just in case.
You're wondering i use the morphe 35c.
Palette you guys know you can use coach.
James for 10% off and now with this eye.
Look mermaids are shaking back to the.
Point of this video we're talking about.
Foundation today and i think i have.
Finally gathered my final thoughts for.
You guys when i first heard that tarte.
Was releasing a foundation version of.
The iconic shape tape concealer i was so.
Beyond excited i was honestly ready to.
Have this be my new holy grail product i.
Was ready to throw my too faced born.
This way literally out the window and.
Have it be my new favorite foundation.
But not gonna lie after trying the.
Sounds today i'm underwhelmed.
I think the matte foundation does.
Exactly what it claims to do it is very.
Very full coverage as you can see my.
Skin tone is very very even which i love.
My under eye bags a 5 o'clock shadow and.
Acne is pretty much all even out and.
Covered over which is great because.
Clearly we have a lot going on on the.
Face right now the one thing that i will.
Say that i don't really love about the.
Matte foundation is that when it says it.
Dries down matte it dries down.
Real real matt while applying it it was.
Actually drying down as i put it on my.
Face so when i went into my beauty.
Blender i almost could barely even blend.
In because it was literally already dry.
If you're someone like me who has only.
Skin i think that this foundation would.
Be passable for you being that both the.
Oils on my skin and the dryness of the.
Foundation are kind of like fighting.
Against each other to create like a.
Pretty good base but if you have normal.
Or dry skin this is gonna be a major.
Major no for you you probably are gonna.
Look like vanilla cake mix and that is.
Obviously never the move so look to the.
Matte side i believe that the hydrating.
Formula pretty much does exactly as it.
Claims to us well it is definitely a.
More medium coverage rather than full.
Coverage it did a really great job of.
Evening out my skin tone which obviously.
We want in a foundation but there is a.
Little bit more of my skin up peeking.
Through i'm pretty lucky to usually have.
Really really smooth skin and texture is.
Usually not a big problem for me i'm not.
Gonna discuss my forehead region because.
Clearly we have a little bit of a.
Situation going on up there right now.
But on the side of my nose and in this.
Region like on my cheek where my pores.
Are my texture actually looks pretty bad.
I really don't even have that big of.
Pores but for some reason this.
Foundation i feel like is making them.
Look really really large and definitely.
Emphasizing them which is never fun and.
The size of my nose actually looks.
Pretty rough which i feel like is kind.
Of just trumping my whole nose contour.
Which you guys know it's absolutely.
Vital to my makeup routine so i'm really.
Not loving how this region looks on the.
Hydrating side after testing and wearing.
Both of the tarte shape key foundations.
I will say that i do like them i think.
It works beautifully on the skin and.
Would be a really really great full.
Coverage option to all of you guys but i.
Just simply don't fear control.
Recommending a foundation that has a.
Shade range that so many of you guys are.
Excluded from if you do decide to check.
Out this foundation that is totally up.
To you i honestly cannot control you or.
Tell you how to spend your money at.
Least you know in this case that if you.
Are spending your hard-earned coins on.
This that you're getting a good product.
In return but for me personally i will.
Not be using this again or promoting it.
On my channel until tart decides to.
Diversify and make their shade range.
More inclusive because as it stands.
Right now it is very very embarrassing.
Turn i love you guys that i know so many.
Avid beauty fans out there really really.
Love you as well we are rooting for you.
We were all rooting for you but this.
Launch was a major major disappointment.
I really hope you guys are able to take.
All this feedback and constructive.
Criticism into consideration for future.
Launches there's so many people of color.
Out there who would love to rock your.
Products but.
Let's be real a lot of the products are.
Really really bomb and i hope you guys.
Are able to take this situation and.
Learn from it and do better.
