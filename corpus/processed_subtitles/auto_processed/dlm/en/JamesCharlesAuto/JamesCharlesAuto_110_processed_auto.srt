Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel you.
Guys i am literally so beyond excited to.
Sit down and film today's video it is.
Not.
Even funny because you guys are gonna.
Get to be a part of it if you've been.
Following me on social media for a while.
Now on my instagram twitter or youtube.
And i've seen.
My photos you definitely know that i am.
No stranger to photoshop and.
Facetune i really love editing my photos.
And i've always been.
Super honest and transparent about that.
With you guys which i think is very very.
Important but whether it be retouching a.
Makeup look or sometimes even taking a.
Simple boring photo and giving it a.
Full-on transformation into something.
Crazy i view editing as an art form my.
Social media accounts are like my.
Artistic portfolio and i think it is.
So much fun adding things to photos that.
Couldn't actually be achieved with a.
Camera a few years ago i did a super fun.
Youtube video where i had you guys send.
In your photos and i edited them on.
Camera but for today's youtube video i.
Want to send you guys my photos that i.
Want you.
To edit me i'm honestly not sure if i.
Should be excited or nervous but.
Let's go ahead and get started.
Music.
Okay you guys i am so beyond excited and.
Also nervous to see what the heck people.
Are gonna come up with.
Today when i did this concept a few.
Years ago i had you guys send in your.
Selfies and i just edited on the makeup.
Which is of course super fun but for.
This i literally want there to be.
No creative limits at all i just took.
These.
Four photos and i cannot wait to see.
What the heck you guys transform these.
Into i included a close-up headshot.
Selfie just in case my makeup followers.
Want to add on a fun little makeup look.
But i also wanted to do a lot of.
Full body photos as well whether you.
Guys turn these into memes put me.
Literally on the moon or something in.
Between i am literally so excited to see.
How creative you guys can get.
So right now i'm going to upload all.
Four of these photos to my twitter and.
Then i'm going to wait a few days just.
To you know give my fellow artists some.
Time to truly create masterpieces out of.
These photos and then i'll be right back.
Here to check out what you guys have.
Created see you in a little bit.
Hello you guys i am back here in the.
Sister studio it has only been a few.
Seconds since you saw me last but it's.
Actually been about 48 hours since i.
Have last.
Filmed and you guys have gone absolutely.
Crazy.
I think at this point the tweet has over.
7 000 replies which is so.
Beyond crazy and i am so excited but.
Before we jump in i do have one super.
Quick announcement you may have noticed.
The very very cute hoodie that i'm.
Wearing and also the.
Less cute makeup look i was trying.
Really hard to like match them together.
But i just don't think that this color.
Situation was the right decision.
Anyway i am wearing the brand new.
Sisters apparel color block collection.
Which will be launching.
Next week i am so thrilled to finally.

That i posted okay got it.
Gorgeous this looks very very similar to.
How i would have edited this photo.
Myself he literally lowered my hairline.
Which is the first thing that i do in.
Every single photo.
He made my cheekbone like a little bit.
More plum on the side.
Oh my god he even got rid of the five.
O'clock shadow honestly pj are really.
Staffed with this i'm so impressed like.
I'm actually.
Like wow this is one from a familiar.
Face.
And he said it's my favorite picture of.
Us with a heart.
A familiar face you gotta zoom in to see.
Who did it.
Louie yeah i thought that he even edited.
Himself in this photo just to really.
Send it home.
Why bring it home it's really bring it.
Home.
Really oh wow this is embarrassing okay.
Well i love that he edited himself to.
Really.
Bring it home there you go if i actually.
Had louis this size he'd be like.
He did however make me skinnier and.
That's appreciated so.
My head kept my head the same size.
I wanted you another really good one so.
This is what's up okay.
I don't even think you can show that on.
Youtube that's only fans content oh my.
God if i made it only fans bella thorne.
Would literally be shaking in her boots.
I don't really.
I don't know what to say about this one.
Yeah.
Oh my god next one.
Okay the next one is from um.
Fat bussy tings me.

You'll get it immediately why it's so.
Freaky who does that look like.

My god that's literally if this laser.
Away does not open very soon i'm going.
To be on my way to this.
That makes me so fairly uncomfortable i.
Don't know if i'll be able to use this.
But.
I'll just put it in we can't use that.
We can't we cannot put that in i think.
We can.
Tech talker will be having a field day.
Okay this one.
Is from your very own editor ryan oh i.
Already saw this i replied back to him.
Saying he was fired after this one.
James did not fire me thank you james.
Music.
Of course ryan when it fully download.
The image put it into.
Final cut pro cut me out of the tick.
Tock and then like edit it all together.
At least we know we have a hard working.
Good editor true this video.
I think i should tell the backstory to.
It because nobody knows the only reason.
That my editor ryan even has this in the.
First place is because.
Somebody posted a video of me singing.
This song on tik tok and it went very.
Very viral now there's been a lot of.
Questions who is sylvie why is she.
Bringing me water why is james sitting.
In the middle of a crowd of people on.
The floor this is a choir song.
And i was singing this song to a crowd.
Of fans.
At my first ever meet and greet this was.
When i had like a hundred thousand.
Followers there was like 50 people there.
Which was like the coolest.
Thing to happen to me ever at that point.
In my life we hung out took pictures.
Together and just like chatting and then.
They were like oh my god we should all.
Sing together.
So i was like oh my god i want to teach.
You guys this song.
So i sat on the floor and then taught.
Them all three parts to bring your.
Little water selfie.
Unfortunately for me that was the only.
Part that was caught on camera.
None of the performance altogether.
Actually was although that probably.
Wasn't.
Great either so i hope that at this.
Point sylvie brought the water because.
I'm sick of hearing about it bring me a.
Little while i think you deserve a few.
Good ones you please.
Music.
Oh my god that is.
So sick are you literally kidding me the.
Lip detail is.
So so cool where it's like almost.
Disintegrating into bats oh my god the.
Cut crease with the shape of bats.
Even like the fully edited forehead.
Makes it look even bigger.
But so so sick it's freaking baths.
It's freaking bad it's freaking bats i.
Love halloween.
Oh i like this one a lot this is also a.
Super creative one.
Okay this is from gemma jones.
Music.
That might give this video band this is.
The original flashlight mary the ball.
James which i still don't know who.
Actually made that but it haunts me to.
This day.
And i don't even know what this one is.
But i'm scared of her with the big eyes.
I love that she really added the circle.
On the triangle too to really tie it.
Home.
What am i saying ty at home bro.
What do you have on your basement okay.
That's dark.
This is from uh lucas okay this.
Took so long i really hope you noticed.
Maybe it can be in the video.
Music.
Whoa yeah oh my god wow that's actually.
So cool the queen of hearts.
Almost like this is an edit but like the.
Way that he was able to edit the makeup.
On over top.
Doesn't look like he just like scrubbed.
It on his face too like it actually.
Looks.
Even the hair too wow that'll be a fun.
Halloween moment for halloween.
I mean he did such a good job editing it.
Nobody would ever know oh my god lucas.
You sister stop that's so sick oh my.
Gosh this is from travis i said this is.
Me unleashing my inner artist.
I actually tried also i included finn.
And theodore.
Cute oh my god you're kidding that's so.
Cute.
Oh my god i'm obsessed with that like.
That looks so accurate it's not even.
Funny oh my god and like the half-edited.
Version of me.
Wow this is so cool i love this the.
Explanation behind this is you cutting.
Out the negativity in your life and not.
Letting terry down while you thrive and.
Making all your dreams come true i just.
Constantly want to remind you how far.
You come and how proud.
Of you i am oh that's gorge.
Wow oh my god the influencer poster the.
Palette the oh my god.
She even edited my clothing into sisters.
Apparel that's a true sister oh my god.
Positive comments.
Oh they're negative comments but it's me.
Getting rid of them yeah.
Oh my gosh michelle thank you so much.
For making this edit i was literally.
Already in such a good positive mood.
Today but that just made my smile so.
Much.
Bigger i love you and appreciate the.
Support so so much.
This is a masterpiece.
Oh my god literally lizzo snake charming.
Me.
That is an edit that i never in a.
Million years could have imagined.
Somebody putting together.
And it's well executed too she looks so.
Skinny she they didn't make me look.
Really skinny.
Gorgeous so when i first brought this.
Idea to you of shooting this video and.
You're really excited because you watch.
A bunch of photoshop youtubers all the.
Time.
All the time every day yes and i know.
One of your favorites.
Is betty productions yes and so.
We reached out to him and he said he.
Would make an edit for you.
I'm so scared.
Yes oh my god.
Oh my god oh wow i'm literally.
Speechless this to me is a prime example.
Of why i consider photo editing like a.
Full-on art form obviously like.
Retouching it like this or two very.
Different feels but like they're still.
To me equally as important to making a.
Full image like this is so sick not only.
Did he completely move my feet around he.
Put me underwater he added the light.
Reflection from the jellyfish i look.
Like i'm literally glowing.
The oh my god this is why i love this.
Stuff so much.
I wish that my skill levels were up to.
Par with like doing stuff like this.
Louis thank you for.
Coordinating that that's so sick okay.
Well that.
Was definitely such an incredible and.
Positive end to this video that.
Literally just made me so.
So so happy obviously i wasn't able to.
Look through all 7 000 responses but.
There were so many amazing incredible.
Talented artists out there i had so much.
Fun looking through at these memes these.
Edits and also these full-on art pieces.

Crusty dusted face into photoshop and.
