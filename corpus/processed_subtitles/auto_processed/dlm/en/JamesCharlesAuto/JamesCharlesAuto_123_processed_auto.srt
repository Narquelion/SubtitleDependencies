Campaign commercial i created this over.
Six months ago now and you have no idea.
I have never wanted to post an instagram.
Picture more and i can tire life but.
I've had to hold it back and keep it a.
Secret i am so proud of how this look.
Turned out it was inspired by my look.
From 2017 a blank canvas and we had this.
Beautiful like bay packaging and we have.
More fiats james charles and my iconic.
Sister signature and just a white glossy.
Font the packaging is super super.
Minimalist but i absolutely love it and.
Think it is just so chic and we turn the.
Pala to the back we have this cute.
Little note from me sister david it says.
Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my palette i love glam.
But i also have a huge passion for crazy.
Colorful outside of the box makeup and i.
Created this palette with that in mind i.
Included every beautifully formally to.
Change necessary to create literally any.

Into that in a second i cannot wait to.
See what you come up with when you.
Unleash your inner artist team charles.

Little bit later on in the video so make.
Sure you stay tuned but for now let's.
Jump into this baby if we just pop her.
Right on open this is a brand new one.
Comes in a bubble wrap so it stays.
Protective when it's shipping tada oh my.
God so the palette comes in a matte.
Black soft touch i literally love how.
These feels so so so much and the text.
On the fries in a shiny box has more.
Phoenix james charles just like the.
Packaging on the outside and the white.
It is just very very sleek minimalistic.
Very much my overall style oh my god i.
Have it open this on camera 439.
Beautiful amazing colors now the top of.
The packaging we have this little saying.
Right up here that you heard at the end.
Of the campaign commercial in my little.
Isn't that it unleash your inner artist.
Now i've had this quote in the notes app.
On my phone for literally two years now.
And i knew that i wanted to use it for a.
Big project and hello what better to use.
It for that this eyeshadow palette my.
Admission as an artist inside of the.
Community has always been making it fun.
Creating a new content doing things that.
Nobody would ever dare to do taking a.
Step away from tutorials and making.
Beauty videos actually entertaining.
Playing with color playing with.
Avant-garde looks that most people would.
Necessarily deem where will a brutal.
Content and they're doing that i've been.
Able to express myself and put myself.
Out there and find all of your sisters.
And find such an amazing audience that.
Also has such a love and appreciation.
For art so that is why we are unleashing.
Our inner artist with this collection.
Now obviously you'll notice that there.
Is a plastic knife that comes over all.
The shades is obviously protects that.
Wall traveling but all the stadiums are.
Also listed on every single one of the.
Colors there are 39 iconic shay names.
That you guys are definitely going to.
Recognize from all my sister sayings and.
Also some things that definitely have a.
Personal wing to me as well we're going.
To get into those in a quick second but.
For now i'm just going to take this off.
And show you guys.
A pallet in all its glory obviously you.
Guys know the morphe palettes usually.
Come with 35 but this one comes with 39.
With the middle row all hopping baker.
Pans this is obviously remodeled after.
The 39a which is the palette that.
Launched last holiday season that i was.
Actually the model for i'm gonna dive.
Into each individual shade in a second.
But before i do that i want to put the.
Palette into three sections and kind of.
Explain how i organized it and why it.
Looks like what it does and it's gonna.
Make a lot more sense right now.
So unleash your inner artist the whole.
Point of creating my sister collection.
With morphe was that i felt like there.
Was something missing on the market and.
That was one i shadow palette that could.
Truly create any single look no i know.
This palette is obviously very very big.
But the whole point in making this was.
That you could travel with it take it.
Anywhere take it on set if you're.
Working makeup artist have it in your.
Kit if you're at home beauty guru like.
Myself and literally be able to create.
Any single look imaginable so the top.
Two rows of the palette are for my more.
Everyday wearable glam shana type of.
People now the middle role you'll notice.
Are all the bigger shades now more we.
Did this for the first time in the 39a.
Palette and they did all the transition.
Shades because i thought what's so cool.
How much time does to say for each.
Different skin tone but you definitely.
Don't need someone transition change so.
What did i do.
I made these seven middle shades all the.
Most-used.
Shades no matter what look you're.
Creating so we have a matte white and a.
Matte block perfect for setting your.
Base or deepening anything up whether it.
Be a typical everyday glam look or an.
Artistry or even a try look we have a.
Highlighting shade this is literally one.
Of the most beautiful highlighters ever.
I will show you in a second and then.
These four colors are all four colors.
Needed to create literally any warm tone.
Of smoky eyes so you have your.
Transition shade you have your deepening.
Shade you have your further deepening.
Speed and then you have your further.
Deepening shape now what you've all been.
Waiting for.
Last but certainly not least the bottom.
Two rows of the palette are all of our.
Rainbow shades now as an artist and.
Starting off i have always wanted my.
Perfect rainbow eyeshadow kit but i have.
Never been able to find it obviously the.
Morphe 35c as muslin that i've used for.
A very very long time but it is gone now.
R.i.p it gone and now to be forgotten to.
Replace by this baby right here there.
Were definitely a lot of shades in there.
That i felt like needed a major major.
Improvement so when i had this palette i.
Di.
Morpheme very very closely to firmly.
Every single one of these j's to create.
Literally the most bomb rainbow.
Eyeshadow colors you will ever see in.
Your entire life so before we actually.
Get into the individual swatches i do.
Want to kind of go over each of the.
Individual foremost we have going on in.
Here because there quite a few i did.
Tell you guys that this is a very very.
Versatile palette and i was definitely.
Not lying so we of course have our.
Beautiful metallic shades all throughout.
The palette they're going to be applied.
Best with your finger or a damp brush.
Using a assessor settings bright we do.
Have one glitter kind of metallic.
Pigment as well you guys are going to be.
Shook when you see this and this is kind.
Of like a layering shade that is best.
Pat on lightly we have one a beautiful.
Blinding highlight shade as well and.
Then of course majority of this palette.
Is a beautiful vibrant pigmented or.
Rainbow matte shades now i do want to.
Touch on the map shape and some of these.
Formulas behind them because most of the.
Math in this palette are considered.
Pressed pigments and not typical.
Eyeshadows now what does that mean i.
Didn't know until very recently when i.
Was formulating this with murphy but now.
I do is i want to share with you guys.
The ingredients and pressed pigments are.
Just slightly different than iron.
Shadows and they are actually exactly.
What their name says it is literally.
Just the actual color pigment pressed.
Right into a pan ready for you to use.
Whereas the iphone has a lot of other.
Stuff mixed in it as well to make it.
Perform it really beautifully now that.
Being said by doing press penguins it.
Allows you to make the most vibrant true.
To color product ever and i am so.
Incredibly proud of these as an artist i.
Will say straight up to you guys some of.
These pressed pigments are a little bit.
Harder to work with it just because you.
Have to use slightly different.
Techniques but once you figure them out.
They are so incredibly beautiful and i.
Know that you guys are going to fall in.
Love of them so my advice to you i have.
Personally found that packing on the.
Pressed pigments with a flat brush works.
The absolute best to get maximum color.
Payoff and to make sure all the shadows.
Stay in place and as well i always use.
Shave tape or my concealer as an eyelid.
Primer before doing any eyeshadow for.
The press pigments i would actually not.
Recommend this now this may come as a.
Little bit of a shock to you guys but.
Have you been describing me for a very.
Very long time.
That i'm definitely a firm believer and.
The makeup conspiracy that primer is a.
Scam now i'll okay still to this day but.
When it comes to these press penguins i.
Swear to god you guys.
Myself and the morphe team have found.
Out over the past several months that.
Using these press payments on an actual.
Product that is formulated for the.
Eyelids is going to make the shades.
Perform so beautifully and it's going to.
Give you the best result possible now i.
Really like using the mac paint pot for.
This and i also like the morphe eyelid.
Primer as well and it's only a few.
Dollars with code james for 10% off your.
Purchase i've never believed in this.
I've never cared enough but through.
Trying these press 10 minutes i will.
100% say confidently that you're going.
To want to use a product specifically.
Formulated for the eyelids for maximum.
Blunt ability for maximum payoff and for.
Maximum pigmentation it all about being.
Said let's jump into the sponges so the.
Version in the top left corner is called.
Canvas it is inspired by my iconic blank.
Canvas look from last year and it's just.
A super light and bone color shade and.
It's perfect for setting the lid okay.
Starting off with a blank canvas can.
Barely see that because it's like my.
Skin tone color but it's there.
Next time we have the shade of ring.
Light which is obviously inspired by my.
Iconic ear by story that started it all.
And this one is just like a metallic.
Kind of bright gold it's literally.
Almost metallic white and so pretty.
Hello next ring like we have this gold.
Shade called so good i love this color.
So much when creating a gold i really.
Wanted it to be a light true gold eyes.
Like so many gold either route to bronzy.
Or to yellow and this one it's like.
Right in the middle so good well i'm not.
Going to swatch as okay oopsies next to.
So good we have this bright orange shade.
Which is called a five one eight.
Inspired by my hometown area code where.
School colors for orange and black so.
This is like a little ode to my past.
Length basically and this one is a.
Bright vivid orange now this formula.
Looks matte but it is one of the shades.
In the palette that is a pressed pigment.
Here is five and eight oh so good right.
There next to five one eight we have a.
Little bit more of a vivid orange color.
This one is called rusted because i.
Always say crusted busted dusted.
Said and it's kind of what this color.
Reminds me other so pigment on this.
Shade right here is a metallic bright.
Orange color and it is called halloween.
Inspired by my favorite time of the.
Entire year and when i officially.
Started doing makeup for the first time.
Oh my god all the potala shades in this.
Palette are truly unmatched look at that.
Next to halloween we have this really.
Unique brownie gold a type of shade.
Right here this one is going to be.
Perfect for placing right on the lid for.
A smoky sultry look and this one is.
Called web gorge and then finally to.
Complete the top row we have this cool.
Tone a brown shade called tea because i.
Love the good sisters type of tea and.
This is literally just the perfect whole.
Tone brown for deepening up any love and.
That is the first row of the glam shades.
All done so starting out the second row.
Right here we have this light cool tone.
Brown shade called punched me named.
Number two my best friends in the entire.
World.
Ethan and grayson our friendship.
Literally started from believing throws.
Comments on their in certain pictures.
And that's still how it is today this is.
Just a super easy basic color for any go.
To glam look there is still i said oh my.
Arm.
I'm not good at this next to punchy we.
Have this peachy a pinky champagne e.
Metallic color and this one is called.
Sister i just wanted a super beautiful.
Soft light color perfect for putting on.
The lids of any it glam looks just.
Because you guys make me soft and kind.
Of happy a lot and that's what the.
Shader runs me off so next door to.
Sister we have this cool tone mauve.
Shape right here called and mary know.
This is actually not named after a.
Flashlight mary this is named after my.
Best friend drew now mary used to.
Actually be a terminus used derogatorily.
Is that a word directed it was it was a.
Derogatory term towards gay people a.
Very very long time ago but the gays.
Have reclaimed it as we always do and.
Now i mean all my gay friends but i say.
Hey mary whatever we walk in and they.
Started from me and true.
I love this color so next to mary we.
Have this shade right here called.
Literally now this is literally one of.
My favorite colors in the entire palette.
Because it is like this bright pinky.
Peach color and it is slightly metallic.
And when you swatch it it actually gonna.
Be honest is not even that impressive.
But i'm originally why i love it so much.
It looks like this when you swatch it.
I guess that is so really really pretty.
But you could either layer on a lot of.
It and get a color just like this which.
Obviously is very very stunning or you.
Can use that in little doses which is.
How i personally love it so if you take.
A brush like this which is like the 501.
This isn't my brush that we talked about.
This in a little bit you can apply to us.
Right on the cheekbone and it will give.
You a beautiful light pink glow or you.
Can use it on an e for brush which is my.
All-time favorite blush brush also.
Available in my brush set and you can.
Pack just a little bit more on and.
Because it's like a peach color right in.
Between pink and orange you can blend it.
Right in between your highlighter and.
The bronzer and it will blend it.
Together so so so beautifully i'm.
Obsessed with literally this shade right.
Here is the color that i am the most.
Proud about releasing in this palette.
Now this shade right here is called kerr.
Kidding and you're gonna see why it's.
Called that when i swatch it in about.
Three seconds from now but i have wanted.
A true red color in an eyeshadow palette.
Since i started to do makeup and it does.
Not exist.
Literally every single round is either.
Not pigmented o or it tends to run to.
Magenta or to orange this is rad are you.
Ready for this.
You're kidding oh my god why have you.
Ever seen a bag that good we went back.
And forth on formulations for the shade.
So many times but you guys i cannot wait.
For you to have this in your hands and.
Start playing to them because this is.
Literally the best red eyeshadow on the.
Entire market and i can say that so.
Confidently that's you're kidding next.
To it you're kidding we have the shade.
Shucks and this is a metallic cranberry.
Red now this is not actually similar to.
Halloween and i'll swatch them x to each.
Other i really wanted to create a.
Metallic cranberry rabbit because i feel.
Like a lot of the metallic orange and.
Metallic red shades tend to look.
Very similar and they wanted that true.
Metallic red shade that you can put.
Right over and you're kidding and have.
It look so beautiful look at how good.
That looks next to shucks we have this.
Deep matte red maroon color right here.

Deepening up any look that was a.
Disgusting swatch i'm scared try that.
Again this is the shade benny and that.
Is the second row of shadows all.

Beautiful in the end this one i just.
Like i 18 is one of the press payments.
You have to work at this and a little.
Bit of a different way this one's gonna.
Perform best when you use packing.

Slight blue you can see it on camera you.
Could never see payments like that on.
Camera that's exciting that's good no.

Beautifully but we actually created the.
Shade in mind for layering so whether it.

I don't really like brush up and you can.
Call me i'm not because for the most.
Part i still stand behind that to this.
Day but the reason behind that is.
Because i feel like in so many brush.
Sets are either too many brushes to the.
Point where you won't use half done.
Because there's a stupid brushes that.
Serve no purpose or the actual set is.
Too small to where you have to order 20.
Extra brushes in order to make it a full.
Useable set this brush set is not that.
So i got the opportunity to make a brush.
Set at first i was like no but then i.
Was like oh actually yeah i probably.
Should just make literally the best.
Brush set at the entire world and that.
Is this brush set right here this baby.
Contains 34 brushes and just like the.
Palette i created it with all artist in.
Mind that you can literally create any.
Single look with it so when you open up.
The box of the brush set it comes just.
Like this all 34 brushes and a contour.
Blending sponge right inside of a custom.
James charles x more feet taavi case.
This isn't so cute i love these for.
Storing on my makeup table i have so.
Many of them over here that i keep all.
My brushes in and they are perfect for.
Traveling as well it comes with oh yeah.
Obviously it comes with the top as well.
Oh i probably should say that i just.
Took.
So it looks kind of cute for like a good.
Little displaying moment you feel me but.
This is what it looks like i'm gonna go.
Through the collection kind of quickly.
Just to show you guys exactly what's in.
Here if you're a true ivan morphe fan.
You probably might have a lot of these.
In your collection already aside from.
The new brushes that i created i'll get.
Into those in a quick short second but.
Buying this brush kit is definitely not.
A necessity and anything i would tell me.
Back on the palette out of the two of.
Them but i did want to create this for.
All my artists out there as the perfect.
Brush set because i did it truly feel.
Like it was missing from the market i'm.
Gonna go in the same order that i do my.
Routine in and starting off we have a.
Foundation brush just the m 439 and my.
Opinion this is by far the best.
Foundation brush in the entire world but.
If you're like me and you don't actually.
Like using foundation brushes so they.
Actually let me include the morphe.
Contour and highlight blending sponge.
Which i absolutely love.
When you soak them in water they.
Actually get so large which i love for a.
Quick foundation application i prefer.
This much over a foundation brush but.
Like i said this that was created for.
Everyone so they're both here and you.
Can pick whichever one you want.
Next resetting my face in place we have.
The e 48 brush this is just a taper.
Powder brush that i like to use right.
Underneath the eyes to pack on the.
Powder super cute.
Next for contour we have the amma for.
All five this is just a fluffy angled.
Brush i love this for chiseling out the.
Cheekbones.
Now we're in the process of contouring i.
Did tell you guys that i've created a.
Few different custom brushes for this.
Brush collection so i want to tell you.
About the first one and that is a bit to.
Eat 62 now this is a tiny angled of.
Synthetic fluffy brush and this is for.
Snatching the nose you guys know that i.
Live for a good sister snatched schnoz.
If you go back to my older like photos.
My nose contours looking at obviously.
Horrifying but once i learn how to.
Contour properly and a little bit of.
Face to it as well my instagram gave a.
Truly shot up and i'm so proud of my.
Nose contour now it's on my all-time.
Favorite steps eye makeup routine so.
That is why i created this one right.
Here it is perfect for just laying down.
That contour and bronzer shade right up.
In there and then tilting it just to.
Blend it oh and you're gonna snatched.
For bronzer we have the big and beefy.
And five to seven brush i love this for.
Going right in to blend together my.
Contour and my natural skin tone just a.
Light bronzer shade and its really big.
So i can get a lot of area.
If you're like me and you have a huge.
Forehead as well next four plus we have.
The e for brush this is just a synthetic.
Fluffy angled brush i really really love.
This for gloss application because you.
Can either go light and laid out a light.
Wash a collar or really pack it on there.
For a bright kind of drug type look this.
Brush the thought of my collection since.
Day one next for brows we have the a.
Matte one five eight now for me.
Personally i definitely do prefer a brow.
Pencil so i will not be getting much use.
Out of this brush just being straight-up.
Honest but i know so many sisters out.
There do love a good brow pomade i mean.
I definitely did it in 2016 the sabre.
Brush that i brought hamid is literally.
What led me to james carlos herbie block.
Brows but when you know how to use this.
Correctly and this brush can truly be a.
Force to be reckoned with and it is just.
A tiny little ankle brush on one end and.
He's fully on the other end just brush.
The hairs all in place and i do love a.
Good angled brush once the brows are all.
Filled in i included the emma 410 brush.
Just to clean up your brows with.
Concealer underneath and it's just a.
Flat concealer brush and then i love.
Using the abbot 173 with just a little.
Bit of translucent powder to blend in.
And set the concealer in place to prep.
For i shall now moving on to what you.
Guys know is i very part of my entire.
Makeup routine at the eyeshadow these.
Brushes are gonna be what you apply the.
James charles x morphe palette where the.
There is a little bit of a twist.
Now we of course have all the iconic.
Parsons that you guys have seen me.
Literally use since day one in all my.
Tutorials we have the m4 for one i love.
This brush it is a big fluffy brush.
Perfect for layering down a transition.
Shade into the crease.
We have the m4 33 which is my all-time.
Favorite crease brush i literally have.
27 of these in my collection all in the.
Different color eyeshadow stained in it.
I love these for just laying down colors.
And packing things into the outer corner.
All you the i'm 433 we have the second.
Brush set created in collaboration with.
Morphe for this collection and that is.
The m45.
Six now this is literally the most.
Iconic blending burst of all time.
Because it is the m4 33s little.
Now we all know and love this brush like.
I was thinking i have 27 of them in my.
Collection.
This brush performs the exact same way.
As its older sister being that it lays.
Down color and also blends it out at the.
Same time but it is so perfect people.
That have smaller eyelids or if you want.
To do little detail blending work and.
Don't want to get that color absolutely.
Everywhere you literally need this in.
Your collection and give me like two.
Weeks and i'll probably have 27 of these.
As well we have the m22 for brush this.
Is just a small concealer brush that i.
Love for cutting the crease then we have.
The a matte one six six i love this.
Brush for packing on a color after i.
Actually cut the crease we also had the.
Eyelet 1 to 4 which is kind of like the.
Baby sister to the m-16 6 i love this.
Brush for packing on either a.
Highlighter on the brow bone or what i'm.
Doing like sunset smokey eyes and i have.
A lot of colors to pack all on the lid.
And blend it together i love this for.
Topping on the shades this brush is.
Gonna be like your holy grail tool for.
Packing on those pressed pigments and.
The actual palette to really get maximum.
Payoff we also have the m500 stick which.
Is like this tiny fluffy pointed a.
Tapered blending brush i love this are.
Going in the outer v and deepening up.
With the crease region we also have the.
Tiny little ab 1 v 2 brush this is just.
A tiny little fluffy packing brush it.

Has some really important use i love.
Using this brush to blend in shadows on.
The lower lash line we have the abbott.

Brush that morphe makes you can really.
Get an on fleek winged liner if you love.
