Champagne atone okay you want to call.
Chocolate oh lord yeah let's do it.
Can i feel those yeah broken but it's.
Still good and does her job.
Wow you loved this yeah it was a good.
One jeez you really went ham but we.
Started doing this obviously you're.
Blind yes right so you're gonna do i.
Wake up i have no idea what you look.
Yeah i want you to describe to me what.
You think i look like well immediately.
When i came in and i gave you a hug yeah.
I was like he's exactly around the.
Height that i pictured you to be and.
You're the builds like even like your.
Shoulder width you're more of like a.
Slim and on the shorter side like i.
Pictured you being around between like.
Five six and like five nine and being.
Like kind of a slimmer build don't think.
That's just how i picture five exactly.
Where i picture you to have like really.
Good hair and brows yeah like hey star.
Point is like what i picture you and i.
Know you're you're pretty into you're.
Like full glam yeah so i picture to have.
Like good strong cheekbones strong brows.
I would picture you to have like a very.
Symmetrical face i've been told that i.
Do have that yeah at least if i don't my.
Face doing it to look like a song i.
Picture you to be like a deeper skin.
Tone than me but still caucasian no i.
Don't picture to have freckles i have a.
Few actually i wish i had a freckle.
Freckles i have beauty marks all over my.
Face.
They're not like a nicely cutely place.
Right on the bridge of the nose which is.
Where i wish they were i have freckles.
There yeah you get bossed.
And then i pictured up brown eyes yes.
Wow yeah i'm impressed with my own self.
Yeah.
No molly that's awesome this might be a.
Workers but you want to feel my face.
Before you began okay first before we do.
That yeah i will say that like typically.
Blind people don't feel faces so if.
Somebody like me wants to like meet a.
Lot if you meet me in person if you meet.
A blind person in person don't be like.
What you want to feel my face they.
Didn't like no no but in this situation.
It does make more sense yes i will be.
Doing a lot of your makeup with my hands.
That's because that's how i do my makeup.
Because i can feel what i'm doing yeah.
Is a brush puts a barrier between what.
I'm doing right so of course those.
Things that i'm gonna use brushes for.
Like i'm not gonna like try to contour.
With my finger you know but like a lot.
Of them the other stuff i do like to use.
My fingers to apply stuff right because.
It does give me a good feel but like.
Yeah i don't know what face shape you.
Have i don't know you know that kind of.
Stuff so we're going makeup it changes.
Things right so if this is a pore.
Filling primer it's gonna be very slick.
Yep yep thick and slick oh sister.
Definitely needs some more help.
Oh i can feel your little stubble yeah.
Basically that goes back in like five.
Seconds flat which is so annoying would.
You get wickley's or here i want it.
Really badly yeah i'm working on it just.
For the like purpose of makeup yeah yeah.
Move canvas everyday yep you have such.
Like a man's brow line yeah i definitely.
Have a pretty masculine face yeah for.
Sure i feel like i have like a very.
Strong jaw line which i feel like is.
More useful in as well i feel like a.
Masculine dog on a woman can give like.
That model ask type of block which is.
Really good well thank you so question.
For you you do you record every single.
Day i do but because you lost your.
Vision when you were 14 14 you don't.
Remember what you look like i don't but.
It's insane to me yes it's one of the.
Like most frustrating things like most.
Of my blind friends when you talk to.
Them like it sounds so narcissistic like.
If you could see something you'd want to.
See your family your friends and.
Yourself with you just want to see face.
It yes like you missed so much when you.
Can't see they say more than 90% of.
Communication is nonverbal of course.
It's a tone of voice but it's also.
Facial expression body language all of.
That stuff means a lot it's hard not.
Being able to see other people when.
You're communicating with them it's hard.
Not to see yourself it can be difficult.
Especially when you're like working in.
The entertainment business you're living.
In la with all the pretty people and.
It's very much a place pay someone and.
You get so many comments cuz like of.
Course i work in social media so i get.
Like tons of comments about my.
Appearance it can really screw with your.
Head yeah but i really try to not think.
About it and just like be positive.
Because it's really easy to focus on the.
Negative parts of being blind yeah but.
There's also positives that come with it.
No they're not as easy they're not as.
Obvious but i think if i live with like.
Thinking of the sad stuff that's no way.
To a point right you just sit back and.
All the time like i can't look like that.
No okay i don't wanna poke you in the.
Eye no worries perfect.
I was watching everybody oh that you did.
Was change yeah you don't really have a.
Lot of recollection of watching anything.
Yeah so like visual memory doesn't.
Really last my mom her best friend.
Actual boss is blind he lost his vision.
On his 11th birthday on his 11th.
Birthday yeah what again absolutely.
Horrible right obviously i'm very.
Ignorant to the topic i know a little.
Bit but i write pretty much i know to.
The topic of blindness as i'm so excited.
To learn more from you today he has i.
Wanted to do is 11 he is much older now.
But he can remember a lot of things i.
Wonder if he actually remembers or if.
It's his brain well i will tell you fred.
He grew up in new york city he still.
Works there all the time for his job and.
What's insane to me is obviously when.
You're blind a lot of your other senses.
Are of course you rely on the more yeah.
We will be in the taxi together in new.
York and he'll be like oh my god look at.
That building over there on 56th and.
Madison it's so beautiful and i'll look.
Over bleak oh yeah that is a pretty.
Building they don't remember oh my god.
He has no idea what he's looking at or.
He'll be like oh yeah look at there's a.
Subway station right there like that's.
Where we need to go so he can't see i.
Think i have that too like i have mental.
Maps of everything around me take me to.
A shopping mall i know where every store.
Is located in the mall and i can like.
Walk directly there like it's like a.
Mental mapping system like it's a coping.
Mechanism you know we have to remember.
Where everything is and i'll talk about.
Things like a lot of people come and be.
Like well how does she know like that's.
Her favorite foundation if she can't see.
How it looks like it's about how it.
Feels or like talked about something as.
If i know how beautiful is but never.
Like how does she talk about it like she.
Knows how beautiful it is i'm like well.
People describe it to me yeah i'm gonna.
Find a fluffy brush to set you with you.
Might love.
I like the fluffy soft ones oh yeah yeah.
That's a good one is it dual fibre yes.
It feels like a dual five yesterday's.
Laura mercier yes ma'am i did this like.
Series on my channel where i started.
Trying beauty products and beauty hacks.
That i was too scared to try oh my god.
And one of them was loose setting.
Powders that's thing that you've been.
Afraid to turn i was always afraid.
Because like loose powder and blindness.
Sounds like a dangerous combination.
There's two base hasn't loose powder.
It's their peach powder and i literally.
Love it because i thought smell like pee.
It tastes like peach - oh my god like.
I'll be putting it on in like someone.
Like land on my tongue i'm like you and.
Then i'm like i actually taste something.
You're gonna need to show me that.
Product i under % well have i gotten any.
No nope not much oh i just talked.
Product over blind girl problems are you.
Able to visualize things yeah it's.
Interesting it's almost like when people.
Describe things because i have like a.
History with sight yeah even though i.
Can't like pull up an image when you.
Describe stuff it still means something.
Okay more so than it would to somebody.
Who's never seen them right so if i said.
Like oh you're using a white handled.
Duo-fiber coffee bar so it's like a.
Far-off it's almost like a memory like.
Yeah i can still remember green purple.
And blue okay guys i see them all the.
Time i have what's called like i called.
Him fireworks and basically i see.
Flashing lights 247 and they're only.
Blue green and purple.
But he said purple is your favorite.
Color purple is my favorite color was.
The last favorite color i after had when.
I was going blind so it's just like.
Remained my favorite color oh my god all.
Right i'm gonna bronze you one of the.
Reasons i love too faced so much is cuz.
Their products are scented it's like i.
Can enjoy it you know like i can't see.
It but i can smell it and it's like a.
Way for me to enjoy makeup so this would.
Be like the davos question ever but.
Since you don't have your site what.
Would be your favorite scents um that's.
A stupid question.
It's not um i say my hands are my eyes.
Yeah i'm always going around touching.
Everything yeah except people's faces.
And so that's like definitely one of the.
Senses i rely on the most i'm a nun.
Hearing yeah as i say my mom's boss he.
Carries on a walking cane and he can.
Slam his cane on the ground as soon as.
He walks into a ring.
You like a million facts about the room.
Yeah passive echolocation so i'm gonna.
Bless you now i've never used this blush.
Before so i hope i'm not going to like.
Heavy-handed with it but that's what.
Happens when you can't see the colors.
Whenever i got new makeup on like wars.
Now the other son goes and i always like.
Ask somebody usually before i leave the.
House to make it to make sure i like.
Facetime my mom yeah she's like my.
Honest mirror.
We all need an honest people in our life.
Like that yes so do you live alone i do.
Yes you live alone mm-hmm my mom has.
Been living with me since i moved to la.
And she will be heading home back to.
Canada on wednesday so just gonna be you.
And sister go up oh my god gallops my.
Guide ugh.
Yes of course i the way are you nervous.
To live alone i lived alone in toronto.
For two years oh okay i'm gonna guess.
Lightest to darkest no i can't stand why.
Do brands just randomly willy-nilly go.
Throwing colors into a curry and so.
Annoying it would make more sense not.
Even just for blind people but for like.
Beginners of makeup yeah if all makeup.
Went in the order of shades okay so you.
Live alone in toronto for two years i.
Did yes i live alone right now.
Yeah very large apartment i am lonely.
And it was yeah i was the same age as.
You when i moved out yeah i was 18 i.
Lived on my own from 18 to 20 21.
I am very people relying like me i need.
To be around people at all times x.
Obviously yes yeah obviously not to see.
But just like to feel like a presence.
Around you yeah yeah what do you say the.
Gala would be like that presence for you.
Or if c was the dog i had at the time.
Okay we live together she was great like.
She would get me out going to the dog.
Park with her and i you know i had a.
Full-time assistant at the time as a.
Motivational speaker.
I still have loved all but that was like.
My full-time job was notational speaking.
So i was like touring law and i had a.
Full-time assistant he would travel.
Everywhere with me so my parents lived.
Close by and like would come visit my.
Dad's office was like 15 minutes away so.
Yeah it made like living alone.
More more company versus like now i love.
Six-hour flight away from my family.
Which is obviously like yeah a lot what.
Have you.
You have to come to my place how do you.
Like i wanted so far i love it i.
Honestly do i told my parents when i was.
Five that i was gonna move to la really.
Like this is the same all i became a.
Youtuber so i moved to la like know it.
Really like has always been my dream i.
Always say i want to fulfill like all of.
Sighted molly's dreams you know i want.
To show myself and other people that.
Going blind doesn't have to change my.
Life path and you have to change.
Everything it changes things for sure.
But like it doesn't have to be like that.
Not to make it negative or anything but.
Like what would you say has been the.
Hardest part about not being sighted.
You know i dealt with a lot of bullying.
When it happened which was really hard i.
Lost all my friends and like went from.
Being like pretty popular to having just.
Not only having nobody but being.
Tormented and know what's really really.
Hard oh my god i can't even more because.
I love my life please do that's what i.
Talk about a lot with my speaking as.
Like mental health and bullying and.
Accessibility and accepting diversity.
And that kind of thing because you know.
I think a lot of people are very.
Ignorant about blindness and disability.
In general it's not their fault it's.
Because society's been taught that it.
Should be this elephant in the room and.
That we're not allowed to talk don't.
Look don't stare don't ask questions.
Right ignore them you know that's not.
How i think it should be we should be.
Educated and talking about it from a.
Young age we should have disabled.
Characters in children's books and in tv.
Shows and it shouldn't be like the sole.
Focus of the character all the time no.
Which is unfortunately how it is we're.
Rarely representative medium when we are.
Were represented very poorly i grew up.
Wanting to be an actress and a model but.
I went blind i was like it's never gonna.
Happen yeah i realized like you know.
Maybe traditional media is gonna be.
Really hard for me to work in but like i.
Can carve my own path i can represent.
Myself i can represent my community yeah.
And make content myself i'm papa would.
You say youtube has done the best.
Platform for you to do that oh my god.
Absolutely i love youtube youtube was.
Like a huge part of my journey to.
Recovery and my journey to finding.
Confidence and self love after blindness.
And so the fact that i can now use.
Youtube to help other people it's so.
Remarkable yeah do you have a lot of.
Blind followers i do i definitely have a.
Lot of disabled followers a lot of blind.
Followers i have a lot of parents of.
Kids who are disabled.
Yeah our teachers but of course i also.
Have like a ton of able-bodied people.
Know nothing about disability and come.
And learn.
And join the conversation and i love.
That i love changing people's opinions.
And like breaking stereotypes so many.
People will initially come to my channel.
And be like oh she's faking it cuz xyz.
Like all of these stereotypes that i.
Don't fit but but then they watch enough.
Of my videos and they realize why.
They're misinformed why they hold these.
Ideas about disability and why they.
Might be wrong.
Yeah and actually like on the process of.
Like trying to catch me alive they.
Educate that it's all crazy to me why.
Would you ever do that there's like.
Those few rare random people who have.
Like faked cancer or like that guy young.
Who like pretended to be in a.
Wheelchair and then stood up the end of.
A concert like there's those weird.
Bizarre random for a few people but they.
Get attention when they do it and it.
Gets media attention when the story.
Comes out that like now everybody who.
Has cancer it's like they have to prove.
It once they buzz it on the internet and.
Everybody was disabled we have to like.
Prove it but that's not our.
Responsibility you know as it should be.
It's the one bad person that ruins that.
For everybody.
Exactly that sucks i think there's a lot.
Of that in the beauty community - like a.
Lot of us have had sister scandals and.
Yes about the beauty community.
Definitely has a very like bad and like.
Dramatic rap but well i feel like it.
Sucks but like i'm part of the problem.
Of that and decides that i definitely.
Had a messy past growing up but i've.
Never totally clean it up and i know a.
Lot of other people as well but that's.
You know young like making mistakes is a.
Part of the journey.
You know you learned so much i mean i'm.
Such a different person now than i was.
At 20 and i thought i was like mature.
And knew it all at 20 you know you grow.
And that's a part of it yeah and.
Unfortunately like for somebody like you.
Who started in social media very young.
You had to grow up publicly and you like.
People have to see your mistakes we all.
Make mistakes and a lot of us are lucky.
Enough that we do it privately so i.
Don't understand like people who fill in.
Eyes you know young celebrities and.
Stars who make mistakes because it's.
Like yeah you did that too you know and.
You can't even imagine the pressure.
Right that these people are under you'll.
Have less brow bone than me.
Really yeah i have more you have higher.
Yeah eyebrows are not very arched and.
They're like more course it's not just a.
Boy thing or is that like a you think i.
Guess it's a little bit of a boy thing.
Also my brows have underwent a major.
Transformation if you were to meet me.
Two years ago and he had the square.
Brown yeah.
If you were to meet me two years ago and.
Feel my brows they literally would have.
Been down here interesting and scary is.
What it was and i feel like oh all the.
Photos are so public there yeah.
They're all there they are all.
Documented and likely i don't get the.
Most hate comments ever and i think oh.
My god people are so mean i love my.
Brows and then looking back at it out.
You're like why did i love that i was.
Like thank you all for leaving me those.
Tough that's all my eyebrows because it.
Worked my eyebrows so now i learned i.
Did another a little bit more arts but i.
Still don't have that big of a brow bone.
Yeah it's so interesting again like face.
Structures cuz i just don't think about.
It yeah you know i don't think about.
Faces looking different yeah what do you.
Really like about doing different makeup.
Looks.
I mean it's art you know it's art that i.
Can experience because i'm feeling it.
Yeah versus so much art in the world.
I can't experience i can't see i can't.
Enjoy so for me that's what i love yeah.
You need to explain to them exactly what.
You're explaining to me about eyeshadow.
Right were you forgetting that so when i.
Get a new palette i memorize where the.
Shadows are so you can probably tell.
Which ones i love i love this shadow.
Right here which is like a matte kind of.
Warm tone brown i love this color which.
Is a matte peachy kind of shade.
I love this color which is like a really.
Shimmery coppery almost i think i love.
These two shades right here i do not.
Show you a lot which i think is like a.
Peach shade not as shimmery as this one.
Yeah but in a kind of deeper peach color.
I love these two for like a really fun.
Beachy look huh which are kind of more.
Brights like corals yeah and then of.
Course like this is a great highlight or.
I'll do this on the lid which is like a.
Light gold yes i usually do that like as.
A highlight if i want to brow bone.
Highlight that is the craziest thing the.
Most amazing yeah it's all memorized why.
Do i do your makeup like i think i want.
To try to go through and a shadow.
Palette and see if i have any of the.
Memorize i think i might be able to do.
It probably oh my god that that is so.
Cool to me when you can't see you just.
Figure it out all the time i'll comment.
On my videos and though i don't know how.
She does it like i could never be blind.
If i went blind i would kill myself i'm.
Like okay sure there's like times when i.
Felt like that when i first went blind.
And was being bullied and dealing with.
Depression guys purple on it.
Oh oh i clean your brushes i'm sorry.
Wouldn't life hands you a situation that.
Didn't expect you just figure it out.
Yeah you know just to i'm gonna actually.
Go back to the concealer i just use this.
As primer perfect hi we're out of budget.
Always who needs 50 million products you.
Can multi use what would you say would.
Be like your all-time favorite makeup.
Land.
I left hart mm-hmm i love too faced.
Mm-hmm i love mac since it's what like.
Brought me into the makeup world when i.
Was 12 13 and told my mom that i really.
Wanted to start wearing makeup she felt.
Like i would probably end up in a.
Disaster if she just like bought me a.
Bunch of drugstore makeup and like.
Handed it to me and was like no and so.
She took me to a mac counter yeah um and.
Had them pick out all the shades for me.
And she had them teach me like which.
Product goes where and she bought it all.
For me and then i figured it out and i.
Would practice and i loved it and then.
Every birthday and every christmas she.
Would bring me to get a new look as i.
Got older and that's how i started.
Collecting so for about five years of.
Makeup loving mac was like the only.
Brand that existed to me and i was like.
Sephora what yeah well mac was the only.
Brand that kind of existed for most.
Beginner makeup offers a long time yeah.
I took me a long time you know once i.
Was like deep into the beauty youtube.
World and i was like okay i need to.
Start trying some of these i think like.
Probably the first product i bought.
Outside of mac was like make up for ever.
Hd which then ended up becoming like my.
Holy grail foundation that was my holy.
Grail foundation when i first started it.
Like still is i love that oh my god i.
Love that i just love the texture like.
It really sinks seamlessly into your.
Skin you know i agree so the beauty guru.
World kind of really got you into makeup.
That absolutely like i loved makeup.
Before yeah but that's what just got.
Like the obsession went so deep which.
I'm sure so many people watching this.
Could relate to.
Yeah that's literally how i started.
Screws the budget yeah i started.
Watching like jacqueline hale.
Nikkietutorials were like the two people.
That really got me into it what are you.
Like like watching back in oh nine i.
Loved.
Juicy star oh seven blair fowler yes i.
Loved megan hart's makeup uh-huh megan.
Parkin i loved bethany mota of core core.
Queen um those were like my three girls.
They were like my sisters.
Literally like they were like of course.
Some of your face in the beauty's face i.
Really like jeffery and really.
I really like carli bybel it is crazy.
Because it is a very very clever.
Community right now and i always love.
People but not many people stick out.
What i think all right whose content.
Really inspires me yeah that's why i.
Feel like i go outside of the beauty.
Community for like people inspire me you.
Know like just like neutral neutral.
Lipid yeah you're pretty full lips lucky.
Thanks juvederm okay rub your lips.
Together now you have to try to do your.
Own mascara don't let me go mad so you.
Can do it easily.
Okay loxley oh i always try to go like.
Into the little baby lashes in my inner.
Corner and that's when i hit my nose i.
Think i still do have a slight advantage.
Because i can see the wand right not.
Like very well but it's like it's blurry.
I'm legally blind clearly i can still.
See but like i think by optometrist.
Standard so you can't drive a car then.
Cuz you know what i've got okay so when.
You don't have your glasses or contacts.
In here oh no i would crash in three.
Seconds yeah yeah my vision has always.
Been bad but it just keeps getting worse.
