Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel for.
Today's video i'm gonna be doing.
Something completely different that i.
Have never done on this channel before.
And i'm honestly so excited for and i.
Hope you guys are too in case you miss.
It or been living under a rock.
Sigma just relaunched their lip switched.
Lip glosses that is such a mouthful but.
These lip glosses are like holographic.
Rainbow glosses like ass and they aren't.
So beyond beautiful they launched a few.
Months back and they took the internet.
By storm everybody was doing a crazy.
Looks at them and they sold out and have.
Not been available since it's been like.
3 or 4 months but they finally just.
Relaunched a few days ago and now i got.
My hands on all four of the shades as.
Soon as i got these i was so freaking.
Excited and my first instinct was.
Obviously to open them right up and do.
Some swatches over on snapchat and if.
You don't follow me on sap you.
Definitely shed when you save as james.
Charles and then extra ass after charles.
I was do pr on boxes and openings on.
There than when i did get products like.
These they're always getting swatched as.
Soon as i got these in swatch if i.
Wanted to do a look so so badly because.
They were so cool so goo does this like.
Black smokey eye glossy lid and rainbow.
Lip situation post it on instagram and.
You guys went crazy over it i got so.
Many comments and so many requests to.
Film a video on this look and reality.
It's literally just a black lip and.
Black smokey eye with these glosses over.
Tough anybody can do that it's just the.
Gloss i guess that are the cool part so.
Instead of doing like a tutorial because.
I feel like that's boring and it's super.
Super easy i want to do like a full-on.
Type of like review swatch type of.
Situation and then i'll pour see how i.
Created their lips from the look the.
Gloves the eye part is so much fun and.
Photographs beautifully but it's.
Definitely not from practical wear at.
All trust me i was like blinking and.
Glosses getting all my eye lids after.
Like three three minutes so definitely.
Would not recommend so i figured i would.
Just skip out on the eyes and do only.
The lips for today that further ado.
Let's get into the review i just pulled.
Up the signal website right now and.
These are the lip switch lip glosses.
From sigma beauty they are $14 each.
Definitely not too badly price for a lip.
Gloss i know most lip glosses are.
Usually like 18 or 21 dollars similar.
Price.
They're sick so you are definitely.
Getting a few dollars off for sure.
It describes on the website as a.
Holographic lipgloss is that a prismatic.
Lightweight and a d-dimensional new.
Layer tier favorite lip color these lips.
Which lip glosses come in four different.
Shades the first one is called flip flop.
And this one is orange holographic the.
Next lips which is called pink lotus and.
Is basically pink holographic next one.
Is called it transcend and it is this.
Blue holographic gloss and the last one.
Is called a double whammy and it is this.
Purple blue green trio chrome gloss type.
Of situation so those are all four.
Shades swatched.
On the skin and i don't really know how.
These are gonna show up on camera.
Looking at the monitor you can't really.
Tell how actually holographic in here it.
Doesn't they look and person they are so.
Beautiful and really color changing i'm.
Really really hoping that it looks okay.
On the footage but anyways envelopes it.
Does say that the glosses look the.
Coolest when they're layered over a dark.
Liquid lipstick and of course i have a.
Nude on right now so i'm going to go.
Ahead and remove this and replace it.
With a black one then do some cool lip.
Swatches on the actual lips i'm gonna.
Show you guys how to created that oil.
Spell look that i post it on the.
Instagram everybody was crazy over it is.
Such a cool look still let's go ahead.
And take this liquid lipstick off and.
I'll show you guys what these glosses.
Can really do alright so i just went.
Ahead and applied my favorite black.
Liquid lipstick i use jeffree star a.
Weirdo for this particular day and i'm.
Not gonna go to these glosses and crank.
This oil slick.
The first thing they're going to go on.
With this double whammy and this is the.
Purpley blue green holographic one out.
Of the four one this is probably my.
Least favorite um before i really it's.
Not as pigmented it doesn't really show.
Up as well.
But it does make a good transition color.
To kind of blend all the other ones.
Together and help create those like.
Inner colors like the orcs and the.
Greens so i'm going to do this one first.
When i go to play this i'm gonna kind of.
Or there i'm not gonna go to the pink.
Lotus and put this on at the outer.
Corner once again same situation car.
Being a lot of gloss i'm gonna i'm just.
Going in super randomly and placing this.
On it different areas next gonna grab.
The shade it transcend and i'm gonna.
Layer this on as well out of the four of.
Them this one is probably my favorite i.
Feel like it's so pigmented and you can.
Oh yeah.
You can really you can really see that.
On camera thank god.
Then i'm also gonna go flip-flop and.
Layer that on as well all right guys and.
This is how i created the oil slick lips.
They look so freaking cool i really.
Really hope that the camera is like.
Doing it justice i can see on the.
Monitor that they definitely look very.
Very involved and person they look.
Literally out of this world.
Holographic rainbow realness being that.
These glasses are only 14 does i would.
Definitely say that these products are.
James charles approved they are so cool.
You definitely did not need to wear all.
Four of them stocked over a black.
Lipstick like i am these do look really.
Really cool on their own and could look.
Really really great over just a nude lip.
Or any other colored lip that you might.
Have a sitting in your drawer there are.
So many cool combinations that you could.
Try out with these so if you get that.
