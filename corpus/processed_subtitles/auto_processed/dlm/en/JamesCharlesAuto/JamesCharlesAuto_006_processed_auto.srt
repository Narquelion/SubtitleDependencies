Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel as.
You can see i'm not in my normal studio.
Setup and i have an amazing beautiful.
Amazing brother itachi westbrook you.
Guys this woman literally is the woman.
Of the make up community and well many.
Of you guys do not know is that we.
Filmed together 12 films on my i got on.
Your channel several times yes this is.
Like a first time for me yeah yes it's.
Been meaning to hop in for way too long.
We've literally i don't know how it's.
Literally was an accident so talk to you.
I have actually been friends for like.
Two and a half years now probably she's.
They've been here since the beginning of.
My makeup repair she helped me move out.
To los angeles i went to her in james's.
Wedding in hawaii literally they flew me.
There and bought me pants because i.
Could not even afford to be there which.
Is so crazy that like how far you have.
Come like honestly it's been like okay.
Like i'm gonna break about you on your.
Channel for most places who texted me i.
Remember i'm about to get married and.
I'm all like ah you know and james was.
So sweet he did my makeup it was such a.
Beautiful experience but you could not.
Find pants and you were so stretched.
Then you know youtube hadn't become a.
Livable paying job yet.
So it's just you know it's so insane to.
See how far you've come and how far.
You've grown and i reached out to james.
You know way back when because he was so.
Mega talented and like it's so cool to.
Watch you know what we mean that so we.
Just have so much love for each other.
And like i'm so happy to be here we've.
Been friends for three years for some.
Reason it literally this happened by.
Accident swear to god she's never been.
On my channel before i haven't on her.
Staff you times we thought it was only.
Right to do something iconic for today's.
Video thank you for being here this idea.
Is actually taught to you so i live here.
So tati actually came up with the.
Craziest idea ever i have a younger.
Demographic so they were probably not.
Alive yet i don't know if i was alive.
Yet for this you don't know how many of.
You remember supermarket sweep but it.
Used to be this game show where people.
Would have time to go like down the.
Aisles and they'd like you know knock.
Over things from the aisle into their.
Cards and they'd have like 60 seconds to.
Do it and.
I was seeing a bunch of memes about this.
And i was like oh my god it would be so.
Fun if we went into a sephora and had 60.
Seconds to literally just like grab grab.
Grab grab grab to get our entire.
Mentality yes and sit down and have to.
Create a look off of that i'm nervous.
I'm so ready for that like when you text.
You this idea i was like oh my god we.
Have to do this right now.
Such a cool idea like a blast from the.
Past i watched a few clips of it last.
Night from youtube and it sounds like.
It's gonna be so much fun so for today's.
Video.
Sister talk today we're gonna be doing.
At sephora sweet and we are going to go.
To our local sephora and we're going to.
Run and we're going to have a 60 seconds.
To grab as many products as we possibly.
Can for our makeup routine have you.
Thought about this though oh you have a.
Game i do i have a saturday i have kind.
Of a small one but i'm i don't think we.
Should share it with each other no i'm.
Not going to but i was actually kind of.
Stressing out about this because i was.
Like i need so many things like i need i.
I'm high maintenance high i'm so high.
Maintenance.
I love thought for you wait our brush is.
Included in there no can use around.
Ashley's right we're making our own.
Rules it's our own challenge yeah.
Whatever.
We need to go we're gonna be going do we.
Need to go do some sisters shopping at.
Sephora bye.
Music.
If there's any sisters.
It's like a speed bump there's so many.
Points.
Music.
Music.
Music.
Music.
Music.
We're.
Oh.
Applause.
You got so many things i don't.
Understand all right sisters we are back.
From sephora and i have one gun of a few.
Things.
Chucky has two entire bags of product i.
Would love to know what your strategy.
Was what i did is i went in and i knew.
That if i grabbed my foundation then i.
Could go to like this sample type area.
And just be like oh that's smart okay.
But then i had this moment where i.
Totally forgot like what i had even.
Picked out where i kind of almost like.
Blacked out in the middle of sephora and.
I was like time's running out and it got.
Really dramatic and so i just started.
Like grabbing things and in the back of.
My head i was like you know what i'll.
Just put this in a giveaway like that.
Low good thinking right so i was like.
Just go ahead overdo it because you have.
No strategy you suck at this and i.
Really thought that you were gonna be.
Like well i did have a shot what was it.
Products you watch your opposite ma'am i.
Wanted to go i was gonna go right to.
Two-faced and then stassi which i did.
But it took me probably 20 seconds to.
Find the anasazi encounter which is an.
Issue but i knew by hitting them both i.
Could get foundation and then concealer.
And then powder all from too faced.
Because i like the whole line the born.
This way and then the peach powder and.
Then anasazi i can get contour in brows.
And lip did you i misled from anasazi.
But i have everything else so i'm gonna.
Have a really good base going on today.
But i don't know about much else but.
That's okay yeah i can go for a nice.
Natural look i can literally recreate.
This exact oh i don't have a highlighter.
I do oh wait how how did this even.
Happen that i this i think has a harness.
Does it oh yeah it has a highlighter.
Okay dude i have highlight liquid and.
Pressed from becca what and.
Lashes i don't understand how you even.
Grabbed that many things like that.
Stolen my makeup look so pretty right.
Now to take it off and make it look i'm.
Actually having a good makeup date our.
Legs are so hard why because i feel like.
You've gotten very advanced very.
Creative with it because i always stress.
A little bit i'm like oh i hope my wing.
Liner is suitable to be in public with.
James i won't embarrass oh my god.
Well i mean you don't see my red carpet.
In this way throwing everything on and.
Hoping to try to sleep eyelashes on.
Leave the lashes on i will allow that.
And permit it in our fake challenge of.
No rules what you're kidding i don't.
Understand how you got everything so i.
Have the dior air flash which i never.
Touched on before remember.
I love this so much and i needed more.
This will work for me i knew what shade.
I was i didn't have to like it's a.
01 i.
Grab my paper on this one you guys i'll.
Just my all-time holy grail i hope this.
Isn't boring i grab all the products.
That i normally used by i want to win oh.
My gosh aid vanilla watch is my hey.
Where are we winning really nothing i.
Decided to look good i guess i know this.
Is gonna be like a light coverage look.
So i'm not gonna use too much or i might.
Look a little crazy okay where's my.
Concealer i don't know if this is even.
My shade i just kind of grabbed this is.
Medium from urban decay shoe this looks.
Dark oh that's not gonna work how was.
That medium okay mmm that's a fail you.
Know what we're gonna do we're just.
Gonna take some more foundation does.
You're not gonna concealer uh oh no we.
Talked about the makeup community sure.
Why not so if you sisters follow me on.
Twitter which if you don't you.
Definitely show because let me tell you.
My twitter is a good and first time i.
Voted smell some tea.
So some tati.
So i was tweeting that i was working on.
A really really big project and then i.
Tweeted saying that i wasn't gonna be.
Doing that project because it was really.
Risky and i never told you what it was.
Why did did i say what it was basically.
Right now the beauty community is in.
Shambles and talk to you i will happen.
To be ones that are on the outside chile.
Having a really wonderful time living.
Our lives love that frost okay basically.
Long story short i have not been doing.
Well this month for many reasons one of.
The reasons being i spent an entire week.
Of my life planning a documentary which.
Is now never going to happen about the.
Downfall the beauty industry and why it.
Is everyone it involves fault and that.
May sound crazy but me and todd you were.
Actually talking a lot about it during.
The planning process because it's.
Obviously a very touchy subject and a.
Thing that i am really passionate about.
And i know he's really passionate about.
So i figured for today's video while.
We're like getting ready using our.
Products i thought it could actually be.
Really interesting since we're obviously.
Not doing like the full-on documentary.
To kind of touch on some of the things.
We wanted to discuss because i feel like.
We're both so really polished about it.
And like it could be fun to talk about.
Also you've been in industry for a very.
Long time and even someone that i've.
Looked up to obviously since day one and.
I'm very blessed to call you a close.
Friend now but before i was here you.
Were here so obviously you know my.
Thoughts on all this but how do you feel.
About it i agree with you that there are.
So many different sides to look at it.
And that in a way everybody could be.
Doing things better like you can't just.
Point fingers and be like you're doing.
It bad you're doing it bad it's like.
Well everybody's at fault everybody's at.
Fault let's kind of see where we can.
Adjust things like this stuff actually.
Makes me super uncomfortable talking.
About it but to me it's really important.
To i've had to navigate through this.
Business in a very unique way i don't.
Have a manager i don't have an mcn i.
Don't have an agent.
I do work with a lawyer if i need to go.
Through contracts like i'm smart about.
It yeah and that's a very unique thing.
Most people do work with the team and i.
Do you know i do have people that help.
Me out but there has been no book like.
You don't sign up to youtube and they're.
Like here you go these are the rules.
Right so i think everybody's kind of.
Scrambling to do the right thing the.
Best that they can for their audience.
For themselves.
It's exciting to want to work with big.
Brands so i get all the excitement.
And i get where people feel pressured to.
Not disclose but we're adam no it's.
Really not that hard no it is i mean i.
Don't do sponsorships because really my.
Audience does not like them and they.
Feel that it cuts down on my level of.
Trust well that gets into the.
Conversation about the consumer for.
Influencers i'm saying it's not.
Physically like there's no challenge.
Behind posting a caption saying and this.
Is sponsored no but i honestly don't.
Think that i would have the success or.
Credibility that i have if i had done a.
Ton of sponsorship so i have been.
Someone that really has not done a ton.
It's been challenging because there have.
Been people that will take sponsorships.
And say that it hasn't been sponsored.
And i know that it has because the same.
We've seen the help in atlanta it's.
Unique i think from our standpoint we.
See it all and there's so much that the.
Audience doesn't see well i think that.
Is a huge part too in my documentary and.
Neces gonna come across as very.
Controversial but i believe there are.
Issues on all parts being influencers.
The main thing being disclosing of.
Course there's lots of other factors as.
Well i'll talk about brands in a second.
Because that's my favorite topic but.
Consumers i think one of the major.
Issues is that there's really a.
Disconnect in the sense that a lot of.
Consumers hold youtubers to two.
Different standards at the same time and.
I think that they hold youtubers at the.
Standards of celebrities and the sense.
That they want them to have a perfect.
Track records perfect backgrounds behave.
Well be on a very very tight schedule.
Never mess up and just like be a role.
Model at the same time though a lot of.
People completely disregard that.
Standard and then say that youtube isn't.
A real job that people should not be.
Paid anything and that people are money.
Hungry and then when people do do.
Sponsorships and disclose people say oh.
We are selling out or oh my god like.
Well i do need money that badly or like.
It's a little bit of a twisted system.
And i think that at the end of the day.
Consumers are consumers and it sounds.
Really blunt and stupid to say but it's.
Like consumers get to choose what they.
Want to consume and at the end of the.
Day it's up to the consumers you sisters.
At home watching to make an educated.
Decision on who you want to watch who.
You want to support what brands you want.
To buy from and that's that on that like.
There's there's no i actually i feel.
Similar i.
Get that there's just no way to dice it.
We are role models i think that's.
Something you do have to be mindful of.
If you're in this business is that you.
Have a lot of eyes on you whether you.
Like it or not right you are in some way.
Shaping the world which sounds really.
Crazy but when you have millions of.
People watching and you are you know.
Sharing your opinion and whatnot like we.
Are role models but yes.
It is up to the consumer to really.
Decide and do research and not just go.
Down one avenue i think that a lot of.
People have gotten overexcited and maybe.
They say yes too often like wait last.
Month you loved that foundation and this.
Month you love this one and which one is.
It right and if it's not just like.
Constant review constant review you know.
I do a five-day week show so i'm.
Constantly in product it's not.
Necessarily stuff i use and travel with.
Every single day i'm just kind of.
Breaking it down and giving you my.
Immediate feedback so that's kind of my.
Gig so my whole thing is i wish that our.
Community was a little bit more.
Selective and i think sometimes it's the.
Managers that are a little aggressive.
Because they're making money off of us.
Too i'm gonna go to the peach powder.
While we talk you brought our brands and.
This is a topic that i am very.
Passionate about okay obviously you know.
This and all the sisters on this too my.
Biggest passion aside from makeup is.
Marketing yeah and i really like.
Business it's like my favorite thing to.
Do i'm just very passionate about it i.
Like the inner thank you that means a.
Lot i just really like the inner working.
As in things it's always very much.
Interested me and the business of beauty.
Is something that is really messed up on.
A lot of different levels that's a very.
Broken system it sure is.
I think the major thing with brands and.
Beauty is that a lot of brands and i'm.
Not naming anybody specific so don't.
Even try to start down with this i'm.
Speaking very generally because the.
Reality is this is - a lot of different.
Brands a lot of brands don't really know.
How to target their right demographic.
And therefore spend their advertising.
Dollars in the wrong way i can't believe.
I'm even gonna discuss this on camera.
But honestly might as well there was a.
Video that just went up recently by.
Marlene estelle the owner of makeup geek.
And it was talking about her truth of.
The industry it really created quite the.
Rock ass makeup gigas brand that i've.
Loved since day one i really were just a.
Lot of their shadows they're one of the.
First bands that.
I thought their shadows were phenomenal.
Over the past year makeup geek is kind.
Of like slowly slipped under the radar.
And like the beauty fades people don't.
Really talk about them that much anymore.
And marlena made her video about her.
Truth for the beauty industry i actually.
Agree with a lot of the points that she.
Was making in the video wanting to.
Support smaller artists and like the.
Industry changing forget it and but.
There was one thing that she said in the.
Video that literally like shook up the.
Beauty industry so much she basically.
Said that makeup geek is failing because.
Of the fact that she refuses to charge.
Big influencers 60 thousand dollars.
Which is the rate that she's been given.
Because of that personal thing that.
Happened and her being on video the.
Whole 60-thousand thing created a witch.
Hunt against influencers and i have.
Never had so many hate comments on.
Videos about product placement before.
You really don't do that many.
Sponsorships i don't make it haunted.
Like because i was like gosh you know am.
I am i in this like i don't really know.
Out of the past hundred and twenty.
Videos that i have produced look i.
Believe there is six maybe six maybe.
Seven yeah um you know and they weren't.
And i i don't even think all of those.
Were dedicated videos they're just like.
Mentions yeah so i really i try so hard.
To run my business in a way that makes.
Sense where i can support my own brand.
Which i invested everything in myself i.
Don't have any outside funding i wanted.
To run it in my way so i've worked.
Really hard to be smart support brands i.
Love be smart about that know my worth.
Like i've done this in it in the right.
Way and like you have done this in the.
Right way to where you're so creative.
You pour everything into your channel.
You have to have financial support.
Somewhere because you do have to pay for.
Your team yes you do have to pay for the.
Lights you do have to pay for the makeup.
You do have a lot of expenses so once.
You get to this level it is it's very.
Expensive to run a business and i will.
The reason i didn't do the documentary.
Is because i truly believe that this.
Industry is based on ignorance and the.
People believing that this is just like.
A really good time of people that they.
Love and look up to just putting on.
Makeup and calling it a day.
When in reality this is a business if.
You don't want to look at it that way.
That's fine because you can just enjoy.
The content we're working hard for you.
Guys we're obviously here to make.
Everybody happy like it's what we love.
Doing.
You can't accept the fact that this is a.
Business i don't to tell you and the.
60,000 was thrown around and it was such.
A controversial number because $60,000.
Is so much money but i will say the best.
Way i can think about it is this goes.
Back to the consumers a lot of the.
Consumers say you tubers should not be.
Paid this they're just setting for.
Medicare they don't deserve to make any.
Money okay fine you want to think that.
Great consumers are the ones spending.
The money so consumers are the ones who.
Buy makeup and it's unrealistic to just.
Say if you hate the beauty industry stop.
Buying makeup because it's never gonna.
Happen it's a billion dollar industry.
Consumers are the ones who put the money.
In the brands pockets and the brands.
Help to advertise brands that don't.
Advertise fall under the radar and all.
Brands have advertising budget every.
Single brand ever as a mine what.
Most brands well you're the advertising.
Budget but you just don't have to pay.
For because it's you feel bad for me of.
No budget yes.
I've already been taking mine so i'm on.
I only have a few days left in my bag it.
Is true though okay jokes aside most.
Brands have huge budgets and what they.
Spend in traditional media would be you.
Would just be shh right so think about.
It this way if a brand wants to do a.
Campaign right say influences are off.
The table we hate influencers buy your.
Jobs over that leaves a brand to do a.
Traditional media campaign i'm going off.
On this this is something i'm very.
Passionate about you want to do a.
Traditional media campaign you don't.
Have to assign the work to the people.
That are in your internal team and they.
Have to plan the whole campaign great.
Once the campaign is planned you have to.
Rent a studio space which is very very.
Expensive in los angeles then you have.
To rent all of the equipment you have to.
Hire a videographer you have to hire a.
Photographer you have to hire a producer.
You have to hire all the models and pay.
Their day rate you have to hire hair and.
Makeup to do their entire faces to get.
Them ready for the commercial you have.
To hire an editor to then work on the.
Finished product and higher probably.
Assistants to help you and make sure.
That the set day runs smoothly that's.
Why we're gonna cost upwards of like two.
Hundred to three hundred thousand.
Dollars per day of shooting that's true.
But that's not it because then once you.
Have the finished commercial fully done.
It's not just gonna sit on your little.
Flash drive at your desk you actually.
Have to get it shown and that's what the.
Things get really pricey because then.
These brands have to pay for advertising.
Space and let me tell you because this.
Is a constant battle that youtubers are.
Always fighting advertising is very ver.
Expensive to get ads running on tv.
Networks on popular channels during the.
Superbowl it cost several hundred.
Thousand dollars for a few seconds so.
You probably spent let's say five.
Hundred thousand dollars to get this.
Commercial made and now shown right and.
Your goal is to make a million dollars.
Of sales your profit margin has now been.
50 percent this is a lot of math it is.
And this model has been around for.
Hundreds and hundreds of years and it's.
Worked very very well for major brands.
So a brand pays an influencer back to.
The original decision brain wants to do.
A campaign traditional media buy.
Influences are back you get your job.
Back you're welcome you want to do it.
Camp into that influence are great so.
They say hey james we want you to do a.
Video about our product right they don't.
Have to pay for the studio space because.
It's already in the house.
And they'd have to pay for the equipment.
Because it's already in the house they'd.
Have to pay for the videographer editor.
Photographer or model because that's.
Already the influencers job they do that.
Already on youtube once the video is.
Already fully produced they don't have.
To pay for advertising space either.
Because the youtube channel of the.
Influencer is already getting viewed by.
Millions of people say the brand's -.
Let's make a million dollars dr.
Martinez video they pay said influencer.
At sixty thousand dollars their profit.
Margin is now at ninety four percent why.
In any way shape or form what a brand.
Pay five hundred thousand dollars when.
They could pay sixty thousand dollars.
And get a very same if not maybe even.
Better because right now a lot of people.
Are looking to influencers for true.
Honest reviews result yes why it doesn't.
Make any sense.
Influencer marketing regardless of.
Whatever your personal opinion on it.
Maybe it's a system that works it's a.
System that is very very efficient and.
Is a system that is very very cost.
Effective and it's probably not going to.
Go away for a very very long time.
So i think it's up to the public to.
Educate themselves on it and not hate it.
Because it's not the influencers problem.
That they're taking a deal if the fact.
That advertising exists in every single.
Industry and the beauty industry is a.
Billion dollar industry and everybody.
Needs to make money and support.
Themselves somehow from the consumer to.
The influencer to also the brand owner i.
Think that you have to look at the.
Realistic overall you know math of.
Everything and again it gets a little.
Bit cluttered when you look at one.
Person who has x amount reach another.
Person has a different reach.
Really like throwing out a broad number.
Like 60k made everybody feel like that.
Was just a universal number for every.
Single person words of content and.
That's just not the case i was just very.
Irresponsible if i'm i yeah well i mean.
I have to agree with that.
I like marlena i've loved her products.
For so long you know i put in my truth.
Video an email exchange not wanting.
Money from her i think a lot of people.
Have loved her brand a lot of people.
Have loved her product i think she.
Probably has a lot of frustration with.
You know relationships falling apart.
Like that whole behind the scenes i'm.
Not gonna get into no it's nobody's.
Nobody's business.
I mean i have so much that i could just.
Lay out on my channel all the time but.
It's just not appropriate because you.
Guys don't come to see me for that you.
Come for reviews you come to escape the.
World right i do my best to not throw.
All of that information that's private.
Your way to confuse you so i do agree.
With that number being thrown around was.
Kind of like wait what whoa.
It stirred up a lot of dirt it really.
Did it started this weird tension of.
What's the right way to do this business.
And everyone can do it their own way.
Yeah you know and as long as you are.
Being honest with your subscribers great.
I think that the influencers need to be.
More honest and i need to be very open.
When they're doing sponsorships i think.
The influencer should only take.
Sponsorships when it's a product that.
They actually care about one i think it.
Makes everybody else look really bad.
Yeah - you're deluding everybody else's.
Rate card three you're gonna lose the.
Trust of your own subscriber so you're.
Yes there's my piece of advice for you.
You're ruining it for yourself as for.
Brands i think that they need to do a.
Better job of educating themselves on.
How marketing works and who they want to.
Work with hiring some five million.
Followers and they're getting 10,000.
Likes that engagement is very very low.
And it's probably not someone who's.
Going to make you that money back.
Whereas you can hire someone with five.
Million followers that's getting five.
Hundred thousand likes 10% engagement.
Which is usually a very good a typical.
Number you're probably gonna make your.
Money back it's up to the brand make the.
Right decision do your research on who.
Is doing well who's name is being talked.
About a lot and who has good engagement.
And who can really convert to sales and.
It's for the consumers make an educated.
Decision on the industry that you're.
Supporting pick people that you want to.
Watch that you believe are generally.
Here for the right reasons pick people.
That you see working really really hard.
There's nothing wrong with doing.
Answer ships as long as you truly.
Believe that they like the product and.
One thing and that's up to you as a.
Consumer to decide how january they're.
Actually being also at the same time.
Though mine here on business.
Love you sisters the most you guys are.
Very good about this i'm not saying this.
Is you but it's a general issue in the.
Beauty community these numbers should.
Have never even been brought to the.
Surface in the first place.
There were nobody's business and i think.
It's very responsible no and i think.
Because it's out there that's why i feel.
Ok to discuss it it's a business whether.
You want to admit it or not and of.
Course yes i'm here to inspire people.
And to make people happy trust me i.
Would not be here anymore if it was not.
For that because this job behind the.
Scenes can be so insane so i am gonna.
Touch on the whole you know this is a.
Job this is a business you know for me i.
Have employees i do have to show up to.
Work every day there's just no different.
Way to slice it so i do approach this as.
A business and i take it very seriously.
And that doesn't mean that i'm not.
Passionate about it that doesn't mean i.
Don't love it it just means that this is.
Something really incredible that turned.
Into the best job ever and i'm not.
Ashamed of that you know you shouldn't.
Be either but so many people are and.
They're like oh i hate that youtube.
Feels like a job you know and it's like.
Well but it's the best job it is you.
Know and i feel really privileged so on.
One hand i feel like oh my gosh i'm so.
Grateful i don't want anybody to get the.
Vibe then i'm not but there are a lot of.
Things that are very stressful and they.
Give us just a feeling of pressure a lot.
Of the time and i think that number.
Being released kind of made us all feel.
Like oh my god we're all the bad guy we.
Should feel horrible when that was just.
One isolated incident and i think as far.
As roi goes for business.
You are so spot-on with that like i.
Really feel that brands need to do more.
Education don't be afraid to ask for.
Analytics they're there i think these.
Issues are all very fixable.
I think everybody just had a little bit.
More respect for everybody else.
Everybody did their proper research on.
Who they want to support who they want.
To buy from who they want to watch.
This industry would be much better off.
And i really just wish everybody would.
Stop being greedy whether it be for.
Money for brand deals or for information.
And just get back to what it really is.
It's just makeup i think that we.
Move in a more positive direction and i.
Think the community it needs to be more.
Respectful of each other instead of.
Pointing fingers and playing the blame.
Game because like we're all in this.
Together and i don't like hearing that.
The community is falling apart you can.
Only trust yourself like i try so hard.
To not be jaded in this community right.
Like you have to keep some openness.
About you yeah right and you have to.
Believe that there can be good and i.
Think we have the best job on earth and.
It it's so exciting and we're so blessed.
That doesn't mean it's not hard it.
Doesn't mean it's not a ton of work and.
A ton of pressure but it is good and you.
Guys give us that and i am so grateful.
And james is so grateful i just think.
People are tired of being dragged you.
Know in every which direction it's like.
Hey let's all have a better attitude.
About it let's all disclose let's all be.
A little not honest and let's all see.
You're a part of it instead of pointing.
A finger at everybody else amen and the.
Setting sprays coming through that's.
Gonna say speaking of makeup let's go.

Like little business conversation i know.
This is not planned.
Like came out of nowhere i was like hey.
I was thinking of this thing let's chat.
About this is a topic that i know both.
Dante and i are very very passionate.
About this industry something that we.
Care a lot about i mean clearly it shows.
This woman has been here for eight years.
Asli killing it being such a huge role.
Model to me and everybody else involved.
And it's an industry that we don't want.
To see fail and right now i feel like.
It's in a very very uncomfortable and.
Weird place and everybody has just a.
Little bit of a weird feeling in their.
Heart so i just wanted to address these.
Issues head-on because i went from being.
Someone who literally could not even.
Afford to buy makeup to being a smaller.
Influencer to being a bigger influencer.
To then being at the level of literally.
Working on consulting and marketing with.
These brands so i've seen all aspects of.
It and i truly believe that it can be.
Fixed.
I believe that we're all here for one.
Shared life yeah being makeup and i just.
Want to see it go back to that and.
Everybody has to work hard and put food.
On the table and nobody can eat lipstick.
Forever so let's leave it at that.
Also amen yeah if you like my sister's.
