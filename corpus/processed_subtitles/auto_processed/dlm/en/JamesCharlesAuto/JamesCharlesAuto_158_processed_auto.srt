To film and i think i want to do a.
Vonlee's addison's.
Abbey's or the 3 a's and then oh my gosh.
Okay okay you guys so out of the four.
Looks i think i'm gonna start off with.
The easiest one which it's really not.
Even easy at all but it's abby's and.
Gucci look so i'm going to zoom you in a.
Little bit and we're going to get.
Started okay i'm first starting off a.
Little bit of concealer on my eyelid to.
Act as my eye a shadow base as always.
And then i'm gonna set that in place and.
Draw that like brown a wing it using the.
Shader punch me from my palette while.
I'm working on this eye as well i want.
To take a brief moment to dis brag about.
Abbey roberts and how literally proud i.
Am of her if you guys don't follow me on.
Instagram for a long time now which if.
You don't.
Hello wouldn't even doing you absolution.
Um i used to do these things probably.
Like two years ago called sister sunday.
Takeovers were basically every single.
Weekend.
I looked for incredibly talented but.
Like unknown small influencers and i.
Asked them to film videos creating a.
Makeup blog and then i posted it on my.
Stories and like gave them a bunch of.
Definite try to help them grow their.
Pages it was a really fun way to just.
Showcase a smaller artist which.
Obviously we were now doing in a much.
Bigger way with instant influencer which.
Is amazing but the first ever person.
That did it take over on my account like.
Two years ago when she had i think it.
Was like thirty four thousand followers.
Was abby roberts like that's how we got.
Started and now because of tik-tok abby.
Just hit i think 10 million absolutely.
Insane and so well deserved i mean if.
You guys look at any of abby's content.
She is literally one of the most.
Talented people in the entire world i am.
Still inspired by her every single day.
So watching her like rise i just been.
Incredible and i'm just so grateful that.
I got to be part of it in a smallest way.
Like oh she's just super super cool so.
Now using this red liner i'm going to.
Draw in.
That line is so messy oh i have not done.
Makeup in like a weeks.
You're almost done all i have left is to.
Add the gucci logo now i'll be also put.
A little bit of yellow in the inner.
Corner so i'm going to plop this into.
Here and hope that it doesn't ruin the.
Entire thing i think the finish off this.
Arm is gonna add a little bit of punch.
Me on the lower lash line just to tie it.
Together all right you guys that is one.
Of these at gucci is all complete but i.
Saw a whole nother eyeball to do i'm.
Gonna try my best to do this quickly.
Off-camera and i'll be right back with.
The finished love all right you guys.
Well it took me a little bit but i.
Finally matched the lips to the eyes and.
I think with that being said that is.
This gucci i inspired by my good friend.
Abby roberts all completes right now.
It's probably the only time in my entire.
Life that i wish i had one of the lovely.
Gucci tracksuit to take a photo and win.
This look because like 50 would pull it.
Really all together but nonetheless it.
Turned out so cute.
Thank you so much abby for sending this.
In and after hours to work we're gonna.
Wipe this off and move on to the next.
One.
All right you guys we're back with a.
Clean base ready to go for a look at.
Number two and i want to go on to.
Addison's look next she created this.
Like a gorgeous fun thunderstorm with a.
Rainbow at the end like this is really.
Symbolizing you know the past year in my.
Life it's been a storm and now there's.
Rainbows coming out of it cuz it's over.
With okay so to start this look i'm.
First gonna grab a little bit of like a.
White concealer and just apply it to the.
Lids i think i want to make the clouds.
Very like abstract ask okay so we've got.
The morphe 35o palette which is all the.
Pastels and grab this nice little blue.
Shade right up in here and now we're.
Just going to loosely just you know pop.
This shade right onto the canvas this.
Looks like i just lay down a nice pastel.
Blue layer onto the eye i am aware that.
It looks patchy that wasn't doctor on.
Purpose sheer jam but now we're going to.
Add a nice cloud outline now we're gonna.
Add some nice further fluffs into the.
Clouds still looks like blues adding in.
Some nice white highlight to do this.

Nice lightning bolt so i'm just going to.

On to the next block all right you guys.
We are back with a clean base on and.
We're ready for look number three which.
Is going to be a von teese that fun.
Colored cheetah print look i think this.
One's actually going to be it relatively.
Easy so let's just go ahead and dive.
Right in i'm first gonna use just a.
Purple base i happen to have this dose.
Of color is that matte liquid lipstick.
Lying around and out on the basic color.
I want to talk a little bit about imani.
Because literally she's one of the.
Nicest people in the entire world i love.
Her i mean obviously if you're like a.
Fan or tik-tok you know who a bonnie is.
She is huge on the app she is so much.
Fun and despondent that i see people.
That i've literally never met but the.
Reason she actually blew up on tech talk.
Was because of these are really really.
Cool like crazy a clown but he owes it.
And she blew up because she's actually a.
Really really talented makeup artists as.
Well he also signed out while i'm on the.
Topic if you guys want to see a collab.
Between me and emani it's actually.
During like halloween time but something.
With crazy clowns please let me know.
Because i feel like that would be so.
Much fun and it was so crazy because the.
First thing that i ever actually met her.
I asked her if i could send her some.
Merch and she told me that she already.
Literally had like all the collection.
And when i came home to brag about how.
Excited i was to meet everybody and how.
Amazing they all were my assistant was.
Like james we've actually posted her on.
The sistas apparel account like years.
Ago before she blew up which was.
Crazy i didn't even know that so avani.
Is a true sister now that we have that.
All on i'm just gonna grab the shade.
Hello single flame palette and you.
Sisters have that shadow in place or.
Though what now that we have that liquid.
Lipstick all in place on my eyelid i'm.
Gonna grab the show you to single from i.
Am how i thought i'm gonna use that to.
Set it in place.
Once that set in place i'm just gonna.
Use a little bit of my foundation just.
To clean up that line and make it super.
Sharp so now that the base is all on i'm.
Basically just kind of start adding.
These like cheetah i said is this this.
Cheetah print right big cat big hobbit.
Print but i'm gonna use a block liquid.
Liner this is the only one that i could.
Find laying around kind of little just.
Gonna draw on like random little shapes.
This one could be a little bit like.
Wonky a little bit big there you go sure.
Sure.
And now just a tiny liner brush i'm just.
Gonna grab me a little bit of green.
Liquid up sec and i'm going to just add.
On like that outside well i don't even.
Know how do you describe cheetah print.
Just like the outside blocks out of.
Usenet local is like i'm actually gonna.
Grab the anasazi at nora bina liquid.
Liner because the formula of using bomb.
Oh yeah that's what we need i think i'm.
Just gonna go in with a little bit more.
Block and just clean up some of the.
Areas that like got a little bit of.
Messy but i think this is okay actually.
Also just for fun that all popped really.
Accentuate the green features we have.
All round here i'm just gonna take a.
Little bit of that access electric liner.
And put it in my waterline which mind.
You it's not eye safe so just don't.
Follow along.
Beauty is pain is what they do say all.
Right you guys this is actually turning.
Out to be a pretty easy maybe i.
Should've done through this one first.
When i was filming earlier on how could.
I cover a few minutes and do it the one.
Off camera and i'll be right back with.
The finished look i'll race you guys and.
This is a body's 90s rugrats cheetah.
Print makeup look all completes to be.
Completely honest aiya literally hate.
Animal print and this color combination.
Is saying that i would normally it'd.
Never go for her but i am so so so glad.
That avani sent this in because i think.
This look turned out so cute do you like.
It i really like 90s and rugrats cheetah.
Print inspired your boyfriend is a.
Cancer gonna post right now okay love.
You - thank you so much - a bunny for.
Sending this look and now it is time to.
Wipe this off and start over one final.
Time okay we are back the base is still.
On somehow okay a taking my makeup on.
And off four times today not an but.
David's look is actually really cute we.
Put together this like very emoji.
Inspired a starry night type of makeup.
Look so i'm gonna do my absolute best to.
Recreate it and i think the first step.
Is going to be creating a regular block.
A smoky eye what's gonna grab a cream.
Eyeliner this one happens to be from.
Sigma i'm gonna use this as like a base.
Instead of using like a concealer for.
The eyeshadow that will stick on top and.
Now i'm just using a small fluffy brush.
And a little bit of spooky a front of.
The palette i'm going to start by a.
Buffing out those edges now that the.
Block is along i'm gonna go ahead and.
Draw these stars as wow okay so we're.
Just gonna draw star first now we're.
Gonna need to draw with a nice starry.
Trail that really goes around the.
Eyeball okay so now i'm gonna use a.
Little bit of eye shadow to add a.
Dimension into the stars just like on.
The actual emoji having a tiny little.
Detail brush like this one this is the.
Morphe e39 i'm just gonna dip into being.
And try to add some dimension oh my god.
There's supposed to be other little.
Stars.
Music.
Okay okay my creativity got a motivation.
Gone energy at gone i'm going to cut and.
