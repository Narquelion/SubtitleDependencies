Also most important event in the fashion.
Industry it is held every single year on.
The first monday in may in new york at.
The metropolitan museum of art's and it.
Is a fundraiser for their costume.
Institute there's the new theme being.
Found every single year and all the.
Major designers all paris celebrities or.
Influential people to dress them for the.
Red carpet and create iconic moments in.
Fashion history and somehow by a miracle.
I have been invited as i mentioned.
Before everyone on the carpet is dressed.
By a major designer and this here i am.
Beyond excited to tell you that i was.
Invited by alexander wang literally my.
Favorite designers of all time the mek.
Mela is in less than one month from.
Today which is not a whole lot of time.
To prepare and get myself ready i'm not.
Gonna lie i am extremely extremely.
Nervous i've never done anything like.
This before i don't even like know.
What's gonna happen is the only my first.
Time experiencing this but i am very.
Very grateful because i would not be.
Experiencing this if it were not for you.
Guys and because of that i would like.
All of you to experience it with me in.
Today's video we're doing something that.
Has never been done before and that is.
Documenting the behind-the-scenes.
Process of what it actually takes to get.
Met gala ready we're about to hop on a.
Flight in a little bit to head to new.
York for our first official meeting with.
The alexander writing team in our first.
Fitting we're gonna put together our.
Outfit we're gonna go to our dinner.
Together we're gonna get dressed we're.
Gonna get ready in full glam of course.
And i'm gonna try to film as much of the.
Event as i possibly can i am beyond.
Nervous but most importantly i am so.
Grateful for this opportunity to not.
Only attend such an iconic event like.
The met gala but also learn a whole lot.
More and show you guys about an industry.
That i am a super passionate about let's.
Go.
I have a phone charger my phone and a.
Water bottle no bad we're gonna be a.
Nerd for literally eight hours why him.

God and then we get in it and relief.
This is gonna be the quickest trip over.
My entire life i've also be the most.
Excited.
Music.
All right sisters we are officially here.
In new york it's currently 24 right here.
So yeah this is first you're going to.
The back alley and i'm not colliding i.
Am very very nice like mortified i'm.
Doing this mostly because like youtube.
Is such a good new platform in the.
Digital space and there's not that much.
Respect especially in jerusalem media.
For youtubers we honestly get like we're.
Gonna find a lot so the fact that like.
You're willing to work with me for the.
Back gala and invite me is really an.
Honor so before even like it's right i'm.
Just gonna say thank you because it gets.
Really really cool and one thing that i.
Was working on in my videos is deleting.
That boundary and really making effort.
To show like youtubers honoring people.
Who are business people anyone.
About the brand i'm always i'd love to.
Be able to survive yeah it's really kind.
Of you know just experiment and take.
This is my things that other people you.
Know you got ready for i think that you.
Know when this opportunity came up and.
Also you know what derek and everyone.
You know talking about like of course on.
Youtubes gonna be making it yeah.
Excitement there was just something.
Really exciting so i'll be at the table.
I probably say the scariest part of the.
Red carpet oh hey you know once you get.
Past the red carpet it's just plain good.
Together was just like a hat playing.
Like running around the britain actually.
To be honest no one's really even eating.
The city after see might've just kind of.
Like socializing say hi to people so but.
The carpet is pretty i mean every year.
It's still like i can't like crazy.
Nerves or anyone i feel like after.
They're like just kind of smelling at.
You it's a really fun and i'm really.
Excited for you and i think i get the.
Nerves to whenever like you know when i.
Bring new people you know that a lot of.
The times my dates have been like the.
First time like when i brought a.
Humorous or first-time are yeah kristen.
Wiig was our first time and so they you.
Know to kind of have me ignite that kind.
Of you know energy is just oh that's why.
I say it once again thank you.
I'm fell beyond excited for that.
Opportunity and they honestly being able.
To solve it is super exciting too.
Because people don't get to see this.
Stuff happen.
So like they're gonna fall yeah you're.
Getting the full guidance process what's.
We're trying to follow the story so.
That's it.
Music.
Oh.
Music.
Laughter.
This already.
Music.
Like what do you like.
Music.
You.
Music.
Music.
Music.
All right you guys we just finished our.
Dinner hours in front of derek's house.
And i'm just a very very special sister.
Guests will be here today also rosie.
Huntington-whiteley legendary model and.
We just found out they were all going.
Yogurt we just now know what i first of.
All i'm so excited because i was already.
Nervous to begin with but knowing that.
I'm going with youtubers defile.
Understand so much families may feel a.
Lot better.
First of all it's a lot less.
Nerve-wracking this is our first time i.
Know.
So where the news lives up for lily and.
I you kind of like broke the wall down.
Last year first youtuber to be at the go.
Thank you what was like that whole.
Experience what tell us everything so we.
Prepare go up the stairs the one at a.
Time it's not as big as a ton it's very.
Little this mother like 116 stairs yes.
It was like a few steps pendens way to.
Sort of splat yeah no it looks mad looks.
Right especially when like rihanna's.
There with like a wide lens you don't.
Like whoa this is big you aren't there.
Just to watch you and appreciate you and.
Empower you you're there because you're.
There you don't even baby so you've been.
Working hard.
Celebrate yourselves at this moment yeah.
Thanks well i think that's what's really.
Exciting - it's like obviously all of us.
I feel like on our platforms are really.
Out of that about like working really.
Hard trying to take different.
Opportunities that may be outside of the.
Youtube world obviously and i just spent.
A competent for youtube and the business.
Side of saying that's the million times.
So like it's really exciting that that.
There you must get to be half okay so.
For lily and liza i don't know what does.
It mean for you guys.
I guess rosa do this we can see here in.
Respective what does it mean for like us.
As youtubers to be in my because this is.
A very special moment i think those are.
You to the sauce you better go yeah it.
Was nerve-wracking because i was not.
Myself but it's sun comforting to have.
Like like that's a it's a breaking.
Moment like for social media like i.
Think like social media has been so.
Heavily incorporated into this year.
Because they realize the value that it.
Brings you i'm like everybody's talking.
About it there's reviews like it's so.
Fine so to be able to have us there.
We're representing a community that has.
Been like not undermine but has been.
Undermined just slowly means that.
They're getting up yeah.
By god is already in existence one of.
The things that i am most scared about.
Because i will about like i am.
Definitely my comments get to me a lot.
And i know and this talk to save i know.
The secretary shell public coverage are.
There going to be pictures being like.
Some previous living around with two.
Hundred thousand by approximately who.
Like who invited james charles like who.
Like each other's on to the carb and i'm.
Trying to brace myself for it because i.
Think you have every right to be this so.
Much so like the theme is so you and i.
Think like everything that you guys have.
Built and it's exactly what billy said.
It's about the world pride weekend you.
Know you're second there's so much to.
Embrace about you and so much like every.
Reason that you guys should be them also.
Than some of the other people there's a.
Familiarity philosophically for a second.
It's like you know this and i know it's.
Hard to implement but i know you know.
This that the people that are saying who.
Let them in the carpet also people that.
Secretly want to be on the carpet.
Okay so you have to like know that when.
You read that tweet you have to know.
That this is not about weasel this.
Person yeah that's you know thanks but.
There's nothing to do with you yeah.
So one thing bad what you literally has.
Nothing to do with you and everything.
But someone else thinks of you smelly no.
Business yes how they speak of you is.
What speaks of them when it's true.
That's who they are i mean this is just.
Such a special moment for all of us and.
I just want to be able to enjoy it and.
This was great advice.
Applause.
Good morning you guys it is monday may 6.
2019 the first monday in may today.
Yessum that gala and we're about to get.
Ready um i went to bed last night and.
00 in the morning i could.
Not fall asleep and i ended up waking up.
Today at noon noon i'm not done that.
Since i was already in like eighth grade.
So feels good to be well-rested i feel.
Like i am ready to conquer this day but.
I don't have a few hours to get ready.
Now so we're going to sit down and get.
Clam as you can see we're already.
Running into our first dilemma here with.
My alpha that you guys clearly saw i.
Don't really have a shirt on underneath.
The chainmail i'm gonna be wearing.
Meaning my foundation has to match.
Perfectly to my body and we already know.
It's not going to try to get as close as.
Possible i just went ahead and swatch a.
Few of the different ones that i brought.
With me and none of them are really.
Matching so don't really know what to do.
Oh this one from dior match is really.
Really really well on the neck like it.
Almost as like blending in did you are.
Air flash but on my face looks a little.
Light like pasty and pay off whereas.
This one on my face i feel like it's.
Looking a little bit more good or just.
To face in this a dusty shell but on my.
Neck it looks a little bit not good.
We're just gonna blend it really far.
Down really far down and hope that it.
Works or they can like mix the two them.
Together i'm very nervous as you can.
Tell i'm really very talking on camera i.
Ah i cannot believe that today's.
Actually happening this is so crazy and.
So wild this would look good.
Here's my seashell oh yeah okay so i'm.
Just gonna blow the sand all over it you.
Guys have seen me do my base pertain.
Literally a million times this is not.
Going to like an in-depth makeup.
Tutorial i just want to like get glam.
And kind of asked you i need to blend it.
Up into my hair as well so go ahead and.
Blend this down the neck i'm not really.
Sure where i want to blend my foundation.
To the band and it's gonna come like i'm.
Doing that but see now this looks way.
Too dark.
Why am i facing body eight different.
Colors oh i have to blend it so far.
Grandpa phonation it back into here.
Oh my look at that haha i'm gonna grab.
Some do your air flash we're just gonna.
Leave blood mist and how'd it get your.
Body and face be the same color like.
Asking for a friend how do you do that.
Like what precautions do you have to.
Take because like this is ridic.
Oh what about the bat oh and he does.
Blend it i'm like oh i like upper back.
Everybody please welcome louis my.
Amazing editor and videographer and also.
Foundation blender i think this is.
Pretty london.
Finally it is concealer time okay i'm.
Pretty happy with how my face is looking.
Right now honestly think this is kind of.
Good trash let's go ahead and accept us.
In place.
I'm powdered and literally everything in.
Existence because i don't want to sweat.
Anything off but then again it's like.
Kind of cold in new york right now it's.
Not fully summertime yet and also i have.
No shirt on underneath the chainmail so.
I'm gonna be freezing i'm not gonna grab.
My crotch or cat and search literally on.
My face i am very nervous for this as.
You can tell by me not talking which is.
A rare sight for a james rollins youtube.
Video as much as i'm so excited and.
Blessed and thankful and grateful and.
Pumped to be there there's still a part.
Of me that literally feels like i just.
Started doing all this yesterday and.
That i'm still nobody just a random kid.
Living in the middle of new york with.
Very little friends and just working.
Hard in school and it feels so surreal.
This is actually like my life and then.
I'm getting invited to these favorite.
Things and then i get to walk red.
Carpets with like celebrities that i've.
Looked up to and watched and i was a.
Little kid so this is really really.
Weird i was dealing back and forth with.
A few celebrities that are friends with.
That i know have gone for several years.
And of course nobody's getting away the.
Full details of their outfits but what.
I've heard is that everyone is like.
Going so crazy and like i want to go so.
Crazy but i'm like so scared.
Ah i'm usually never my head about.
Anything like i'd really really don't.
Get nervous but i feel like this is such.
Just a crazy thing i'm sister scarran.
I'm sister scarran but you know what.
It's gonna be fun day i think my talk.
Last night at dinner was like so.
Incredible with liza and lily and rosie.
And susan and i really feel like they.
Helped me call my nerves so much about.
The whole event like if i was to walk.
Out of that chair and go right to the.
Gala.
It would've been fine but now i've had.
Like 12 hours to sleep on it and get.
Back into my head and continue thinking.
It's a harsh.
Nose contour oh wow all right you guys.
I'm gonna go into my brows quickly.
Off-camera with my anasazi eyebrow.
Products as always and i'll be right.
Back to start off the eye makeup so now.
It's time for the eye makeup which like.
Everything else i'm a little bit.
Stressed about for a few different.
Reasons if you guys saw in the first.
Thing alexander suggested that he wanted.
To see me in a black smokey eye for a.
Potential makeup look to pair with the.
Wardrobe now if you look through my.
Instagram you would notice that i don't.
Really do black smokey eyes really ever.
I don't really putting block in my.
Waterlines because it kind of irritates.
Them sometimes and i must prefer a nude.
Or white to really open them up and make.
My eyes appear bigger it's just like the.
Look that i am really used to so this is.
Gonna be a little bit different for me.
Last night when i got home from the.
Party i did a kind of play on some.
Makeup and i experiment it i did a black.
Smoky eye on one eye and then kind of.
Like a rainbow splatter paint look on.
The other eye too soon as this year's.
Theme is camp and it's very extravagant.
And outside of the box and i proposed at.
Alexander and he said no still on the.
Black smokey eye and i definitely wanna.
Respect his wishes and make sure that my.
Whole look is part of his vision and.
Also to the whole like theme of camp is.
Outside of the box and for me as someone.
Who does extravagant makeup ups all the.
Time a black smoky eye kind of is.
Outside of my box in a very very weird.
Way so it might work fingers crossed.
I'm first gonna go ahead and grab a.
Punch me at the cool tonot brothel is.
How it on a fluffy brush and start.
Running this in the crease just to lay.
Down a little bit of a transition color.
And then i'm just gonna grab a tea with.
An ab 514 brush and use us to deepen up.
The crease make sure that's nice and.
Blend it out with a little bit more.
Punch me using an emma 508 brush i'm.
Just going to sketch out a line i'm just.
Talking some spooky onto my lash line oh.
Yeah look at this.
I like this i'm gonna chuck some block.
Into the lower waterline and then using.
The littlest bit of spooky and tea mixed.
Together i'm just going to very very.
Lightly blend out that lower lash line.
I'm not evenly putting on lower lash.
Line shadow it's really just like.
Setting that liner in place i'm just.
Gonna highlight the problem using a.
Little bit of face and ring light mixed.
Together this is very like a kim chi nut.
Gone last year inspired a good smokey.
Liner moment not intentional but loved.
Camera already what happened.
Maybe a little black salon moment this.
Is very like sleek sultry this is.
Outside of my box that is absolutely for.
Sure i do like this though i think it.
Was kind of good and fresh and i'm glad.
That i with alexander session okay.
Flashes time i'm gonna gonna face a.
Quick sprint of my amore be prepping set.
Settings right just walk in all odor.
Don't got me a little bit of face on my.
M5 before gonna grab my normal color top.
Lip liner.
Lippy i really hope you guys know this.
Super quick to get ready with me i would.
Never normally do a lot like this but i.
Truly feel so beautiful and so sunny.
Looking to me right now like hello i.
Don't think right right now it's just.
Like this black smokey liner we have.
Like a little bit of lightness on but.
Lin a little bit of more definition in.
The crease super sultry kind of ended up.
Being inspired by kim and makeup by.
Mario unintentionally loved them the.
Absolute most and love this makeup hook.
The obstacles and i hope you guys liked.
It too but this video is not yet over.
Because now i have to go get dressed and.
Actually go there's i'm running very.
Late right now so do you like it oh.

Really beautiful and i'm just really.
Excited to see a bunch of amazing people.

Night this is a really amazing step.
Forward for youtubers in the community.
And they're definitely gonna be hate.
Comments and some negativity after this.

We're talking about it's about breaking.
The boundaries and dealing with that and.
Making it easier for the future people.
To come after we burn this lily how are.
