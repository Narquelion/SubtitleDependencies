Always my fault but it was usually my.
Apology would painfully hurt me well yes.
But i remember there was one time we.
Were fighting about something at dinner.
He was still staying in a high chair.
Everybody got so huge where i got up out.
Of my regular dining chair and i kicked.
The leg of his high chair over and his.
High chair fell back and we had a.
Radiator right behind our dinner table.
And he caught his entire lip open and.
Sort of bleeding and had him to the.
Hospital.
