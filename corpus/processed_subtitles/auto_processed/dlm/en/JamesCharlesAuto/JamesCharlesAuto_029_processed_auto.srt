Step of my eye makeup is always my.
Eyebrows some people like to do them.

To do them after i base and before the.
Eye shadow and then carve it out suika.
Are really really nice and even base so.
I'm just gonna show you guys how i like.
To do with mine today here in the makeup.
Community there's a very famous saying.
About brows and that is that brows frame.
Your face and this is probably one of.
The most true things i have ever heard.
In my entire life the most common.
Question i get when it comes to brows is.
How do i find at the perfect shape if.
You guys want to start day for a very.
Very long time you would know that my.
Brows have undergone quite the huge.
Transformation.
And definitely for the better when i.
First started off they were super super.
Thick and had literally no arch to them.
And this brow shape after very very long.
Time and a lot of nasty comments i.
Finally realized was driving my entire.
Face down no matter how hard i some eyes.
Or smiled it still somehow looked like.
My brows were frowning and i obviously.
Realized that this was not the looks.
That i wanted to go for once i solved my.
Pride and finally admitted that my.
Blocked brows were absolutely awful i.
Tweeze a ton of my eyebrows off to make.
Them a lot more arched my eyebrow.
Transformation was still not exactly.
Complete though i wore those eyebrows.
For a good hot minute you guys love them.
I love them but more recently i actually.
Changed them a little bit more by.
Tweezing off almost my entire brow tail.
My eyebrows used to grow to around down.
Here so more recently i've been lifting.
My tail upwards which gives my face a.
More lifted and snatched look and also.
Gives me a more room for eye shadow as.
You can see over on this eye brow shape.
Is a very very personal thing and of.
Course i'm gonna give you guys a few.
Tips and tricks in a second but i would.
Say that the absolute best way to figure.
Out your best brows is by taking selfies.
It was through that that i realized the.
Errors that i was doing with my brows i.
Was able to kind of fix them and perfect.
Them through experimenting i understand.
That you guys don't have hours every.
Single day to experiment.
So i'm gonna show you one super helpful.
Rule  tip and trick that can really.
Help you shape your brows this super.
Simple brown trick involves three lines.
Of reference and all you're going to.
Need is your favorite brow pencil today.
I'm using the anasazi eyebrow pencil in.
The shade medium brown the first rule of.
Thumb is that the inside of your brow.
Should always align with the outside of.
Your nostril so if you can see on this.
Side right here it starts right when i.
Align it my brow pencil if we move over.
To this eye we can see that they align.
At once again perfectly so i'm just.
Going to draw one little line to mark.
The center of my brow the next rule of.
Thumb is that when looking forward at.
The beginning of your brow arch should.
Align perfectly with the outside edge of.
Your pupil and as you can see they do.
Moving over to the other side you can.
See bingo right here.
So i'm just going to make my mark and.
Finally for the tail of your brow if you.
Hold your brow pencil at the corner of.
Your nose and head it out the.
Of your eye your browser tut's just like.
That so once again coming to this site.
If i hold my pencil right like this i'm.
Gonna my brow tail right there now that.
We have all three of those points mapped.
Out let's go ahead and actually start.
Filling in the brow the most common.
Question i get when it comes to drawing.
Your brows is how do i make them look.
Define but still a natural and hair like.
My answer to that question is always use.
A brow pencil.
I love broad pencils because the tip is.
Fine so you can really sketch in a tiny.
Little hairs for a natural and realistic.
Effect and you can also change the.
Pressure for a darker look on the tail.
And a lighter look in the inner corner.
So you still get that beautiful ombre.
Defined look to start filling them and i.
Always like to start in the inner.
Corners i'm gonna hold my pencil.
Vertically to my face and i'm gonna use.
A very very light pressure and just.
Lightly place my pencil and just kind of.
Flick it upwards to create.
Natural-looking hair strokes you.
Definitely gonna want to start off with.
Light pressure and then press harder as.
You get through the brow if you start.
Off too dark in the inner corner you're.
Gonna end up with the block broad which.
Is obviously not the look that we're.
Going for once the area is although then.
I like to take my pencil and keeping our.
Guidelines in sight i just like to.
Underline the bottom of the brow and.
Just kind of map out where i'm going to.
Go once again using really really light.
Pressure and creating hair like little.
Strokes so it looks natural right to the.
Dot that we've created for the tail and.
Then once i have the tail i'm just going.
To start by filling in that outer.
Triangle and start to bring it back.
Upwards right back into the eyebrow when.
Purchasing a brow pencil if possible of.
Course you should always get one that.
Has a spoolie at the end i freaking love.
These things that they are still half of.
While doing brows and throughout the.
Entire process i always like to go.
Through and kind of brush through the.
Hairs just make sure the product is.
Getting blended together so nothing.
Looks too intense and too harsh and also.
Moves the hair around so you can kind of.
See areas that you missed i need to add.
A more product to once i have the bottom.
And the tail all sketched out and don't.
Worry if it's bessie we're going to.
Clean it up later of course i like to.
Take my spoolie and brush the hairs.
Downwards and then i like to do the top.
Of the brow i always like to make sure.
That i'm brushing my hair away so i can.
Really see the area that i need to fill.
And because if i do it this way it's.
Really easy to.
Time's go above the brow and then your.
Brows just keep getting thicker and.
Thicker and thicker and thicker and that.
Is usually not the best look similar to.
The front i'm using medium pressure and.
Just sketching in light hair like.
Strokes just to structure out the top of.
The brow just like this and once i get.
To the outer corner i'm just going to.
Connect it right into the tail and make.
Sure i didn't miss any areas filling it.
And once i'm happy with how the brow is.
Filled and i always like to take a brow.
Gel now this step is totally optional i.
Would definitely recommend it for people.
Like me if you have a lot of brow hairs.
And you want to make sure that they're.
Laying in the right direction up but you.
Can totally skip this and save a lot of.
Money if you have not a lot of brow.
Hairs totally up to you but i'm gonna.
Using the benefit 24-hour brow center i.
Really like this one because it is like.
Cement for your brow hairs it really.
Locks it in place and i'm gonna do is.
Just run through the brow hairs and.
Brush them right in the right direction.
So they're laying inside of where i.
Filled in that brow as you can see by.
Doing that too and moving around the.
Brow hairs i'm definitely missing a.
Little bit of definition right up in.
Here so i'm just gonna go back into the.
Pencil and add in a few more light.
Strokes just to fill it in now the last.
Of my brow routine which is always my.
Favorite part is cleaning them up to do.
This i'm just gonna grab a lot top.
Concealer brush like this this is the.
Morphe m-43 - and your favorite full.
Coverage concealer for me it is.
Heart-shaped tape and i'm just gonna put.
A little bit of a dollop of this on the.
Back of my hand get a little bit on with.
That brush and then i'm just gonna go.
Right in and start cleaning up the brow.
Very very carefully i really love.
Cleaning up the brows because not only.
Does it give them a much cleaner.
Appearance but if you make anyone's.
Takes while filling it it can see there.
Is the perfect way to fix them up and.
Make sure they are super super snatched.
Once i'm satisfied with the line i.
Always like to take the excess of that.
Concealer on that same exact brush and.
Put the remainder of it right on my.
Eyelid and i'm gonna use this concealer.
Today as an eyelid primer which is a.
Really really great hot because i do.
Almost the same exact thing so it's a.
Great way to save a lot of money in your.
Makeup routine with the dense packing.
Brush like this this is the morphe m33 5.
This is my all-time favorite for setting.
The eyelids in place i'm gonna dip this.
Into a little bit of my setting powder.
Pop off the excess and i'm just going to.
Make sure that concealer is right in.
Place because we.
Not one or i shadow to crease throughout.
The day there we go that is our brows.
Laid and in place and now we finally get.
To move on to the fun part the eyeshadow.
For today's i try to look i did decide.
To go with a sunset half cut crease.
Which like i said and i was a little bit.
Of a crazy look for most of you guys out.
There but i have a lot of different.
Techniques and tips and tricks that i.
Want to talk about because a lot of the.
Questions i received it talked about.
Blending and using a lot of colors makes.
It really easy for you guys to see how.
The blending techniques work before we.
Hop into the shadows i want to quickly.
Talk about makeup brushes because good.
Working tools or an absolute necessity.
To any successful makeup look you guys.
Know that i have an avid makeup lover.
And when it comes to brushes i will.
Admit i'm a little bit of a hoarder i.
Mean this is literally my container of.
Fluffy eyeshadow blending brushes alone.
But i understand it that is really.
Unrealistic for you guys makeup can be.
Ridiculously expensive so i compiled a.
List of eight different brushes that i.
Think would be a necessity to any makeup.
Lovers collection and i think that could.
Achieve any sort of eyeshadow look.
Desire first we have the morphe m4 for.
One this retails for $6.00 ition shades.
Next we have the morphe m4 is 3 3 yet.
This is the best crease brush in the.
Entire world and you need this in your.
Collection i could probably do an entire.
Eyeshadow look with just one of these.
Brushes and i'm not kidding when they.
Say i have 27 of them in my collection.
You obviously did not need 27 but if.
Your eyeshadow lover like me i'd.
Recommend getting at least 3 of these.
Because you can really use them for any.
Single look this is the amma 506 and.
Retails once again for 6 dollars and is.
A fluffy pointed brush which i really.
Really love it for detailed crease work.
Or blending out an outer v this is the.
Amat 2 to 4 and it is a round flat.
Concealer brush and this is my all-time.
Favorite brush for either carving out.
The brows or doing a cut creases this is.
The amma 205 and it is also a round flat.
Concealer brush but it is much smaller.
And instead of using this for concealer.
I actually used this to pack shadow on.
The lid finally this is the m14 9 it is.
A tiny round and a bullet brush and i.
Use this for highlighting the inner.
Corners highlighting the brow bone and a.
Buffing shadow onto the lower lash line.
You can get all eight of those brushes.
For only $35 using code james and i.
Think those will set you up for success.
With.
Any eye shadow look you want to do for.
My silence today i'm gonna be using the.
35 b palette i'm first ending at miami.
For 401 which is the biggest fluffy.
Brush and dip into the yellow shade in.
The bottom corner.
For this particular look our yellow is.
Going to act as our transition shade.
Holding the brush at an upward angle i'm.
Gonna go in right into my crease and.
Start using a circular motions to place.
That shadow right up in there and to.
Blend it out when applying the shadows.
I'm making sure to pack the color right.
In the crease and then doing my circular.
Motions to blend them out this will make.
Sure that the shadow doesn't get all the.
Way up to the brow bone and look muddy.
And unblended because that is obviously.
Not what we want you want to keep the.
Yellow up here in order to make a nice.
Transition between skintone color and.
Then your crease next we're gonna move.
On to our darker shade which in this.
Case is going to be our orange so to do.
This i'm gonna grab my am 4-3-3 which.
Like i was saying is my favorite a.
Crease brush and i'm gonna dip into the.
Bright orange shade i'm still gonna hold.
My brush at a slight upward angle but.
I'm gonna hold this one a lot more.
Horizontal to my face and is staying.
Exactly where we want it in the crease.
And the outside bristles of the brush.
Are gonna do the job of blending it into.
That yellow shade without bringing it.
All the way up to the brow bone so much.
Of the yellow shade i'm going to pat.
That shadow in there to make sure it's.
Very very pigmented and then just do a.
Mix of windshield wiper motions and.
Small circular motions to make sure it.
Is evenly blended out.
It's really important to keep in mind.
The pressure that you're using on your.
Brush throughout your entire makeup.
Process you want to use heavier pressure.
When applying the shadows to make sure.
That they really get pressed in there so.
They're pigmented but when you're.
Blending them out you want to use super.
Super light pressure i mean i'm.
Literally barely even touching my eyelid.
At this point it is just the tips of the.
Bristles that are running against it.
That are really gonna make everything.
Blended together without placing any new.
Product on there once you're happy with.
That blending to make sure it's really.
Perfect i'm gonna go back into my.
Original transition shade brush dip into.
A little bit more yellow tap off any.
Excess and then go right over the border.
Between the orange and the yellow to.
Make sure that everything is blended.
Together and that the yellow doesn't get.
Lost in all of the blending and brush.
Work our next darker shade is going to.
Be our red so once again i'm gonna grab.
Another m 4-3-3 brush and dip into the.
Wrench.
Right up in here when i hide in this.
Color i am actually holding the brush.
Almost completely horizontal to my face.
To make sure that the color gets.
Distributed into exactly the crease and.
The crease only and doesn't get blended.
Anywhere upwards i'm next going to go.
Back into my empire 3z that have the.
Orange side on it and blend right over.
That red in between to make sure that.
The orange doesn't get lost and to.
Ensure that there is an even transition.
Between the yellow and the red it takes.
A lot of practice a lot of patience and.
A lot of time to really master the art.
Of blending and the best way to do it is.
To really go in and make sure that every.
Color is blended seamlessly together and.
Not cutting any corners next is gonna be.
Our final color which is dark purple so.
For this i'm gonna con miami 506 which.
Is that tiny little fluffy brush and dip.
It to the cool tone of dark purple shade.
Right up in here when i go into my.
Darker shade of eyeshadow whether it be.
A purple black dark blue or even maroon.
I always like to start off in the outer.
Corner because that's where i really.
Want most of the product to be a focused.
And when i grab the product always make.
Sure to not really put a lot on my brush.
As you can see i really just packed it.
In there and barely anything showed up.
But that's what we want my best i shadow.
Tip for you guys to do it would be apply.
A little bit of product blend it out and.
Then see if you need more and if you do.
That add more product and slowly build.
Your way up the worst thing you can do.
Is start off dark and try to fix it.
Because there's usually no going back.
I'm applying the shadow carefully in my.
Outer v which is just basically like.
This socket where your jenner right up.
In here where your eye sits i did get a.
Few questions on how to sketch it out.
But literally just imagine that there's.
A v from the corner of your eye right up.
Into your crease if they were to connect.
And that is where you should have put.
Your outer v and then will the ever.
Excess shadow i have left i'm just going.
To drag that into the crease just to.
Provide a little bit of dimension you.
Guys should know the joke this plant guy.
With my red and 4-3-3 it gonna blend.
Right over the edge make sure that the.
Purple doesn't get too intense and we.
Don't lose that red and then finally our.
Yellow we get to take a break from the.
Shadow for a few short minutes because.
Now we get to the fun part cutting at.
The crease you guys know i love about.
Half cut crease and is on my all-time.
Favorite makeup looks to do and i'm.
Gonna show you guys how i do mine today.
The most common question i get when it.
Comes to cut creases is already put the.
Crease and that is a honestly really.
Question that i still at 100% not sure.
The answer to if you grab the end of.
Your brush and lightly lightly poke.
Around your eye area you should actually.
Be able to feel your crease it is the.
Kind of squishy area that you can push.
In right here right in between your brow.
Bone which you obviously can't push in.
And your eyeball which you shouldn't.
Push in because i'm not trying to get.
Sued if you go blind tain once again my.
Full coverage concealer i'm gonna put a.
Dollop of it on the back of my hand and.
I'm gonna grab a miami two to four brush.
Which is that flat concealer brush that.
I was telling you guys about i freaking.
Love this you can use this for concealer.
Or packing a shadow onto the lid or.
Glitter you just need one of these in.
Your collection i'm gonna dip it right.
Into that concealer and before actually.
Going into the eye i'm going to lightly.
Dab off any excess because the last.
Thing you want is to place it on there.
And get a clump and mess everything up.
It's happened to me don't do it.
Once you're all ready to go i'm gonna.
Tilt my head up and backwards so i can.
Look into the mirror and have all of my.
Eyelid a pletely accessible and there.
Are no wrinkles i'm gonna place my brush.
Right in there and i'm just going to.
Follow the shape of my crease once we're.
Happy with the shape and the concealer.
Is all tacky i'm gonna quickly grab my.
Emma to a fire brush or just any tiny.
Packing a brush and go right back into.
The shadow and i'm going to do the.
Eyelid i'm bursting they're gonna be.
White in the top corner and i'm gonna.
Pack this right on at the inner corner.
Of the eye then with that same exact.
Brush grabbing the yellow and packing.
That right next door do not necessarily.
Worry about the blending either by.
Tapping into the colors that cleo though.
They're gonna kind of blend naturally.
And since the concealer is wet you have.
To work fast then grabbing the orange.
Then the red and then finally the purple.
Connecting it right into that outer v as.
You guys can see even while packing.
These shades on there i still have my.
Head tilted backwards which might look.
Crazy but i promise you this makes it so.
Much easier to get full access to your.
Eyelid and make sure that you don't get.
Any shadow where you don't want it to be.
And you get it right up to that crease.
Line similar to up here how we kept.
Going back in with each individual color.
After the fact to make sure it was.
Blended i'm gonna do the same exact.
Thing so i'm going to go back into my.
Red and top.
Right over that transition area then the.
Orange before i do the yellow i do want.
To add a little bit of a metallic shade.
On the inner corner just for a little.
Pop of shimmer and for this i'm gonna.
Use the tarte chrome paint in the shade.
Of top yacht i love this one i just.
Under grab a tiny little brush and i'm.
Going to get it right on there and the.
One tip i have for you guys when it.
Comes to it metallic shadows is to give.
Your brush a good spritz a fix plus or.
Any setting spray and then it on.
And it's gonna really make it shine now.
I'm gonna go back into the yellow and go.
Right over the edge of the two of those.
Colors and you guys that is the upper.
Shadow i'll complete see not that that.
When you really break it down we're.
Gonna take a break from shout out for a.
Second and move on to the winged liner.
Probably right behind a cut crease a.
Good a winged liner is probably one of.
The hardest techniques to do and makeup.
But i'm gonna show you guys a few tips.
And tricks to really get your wings.
Snatched ready to cut someone and.
Hopefully very even there are many.
Different products in the makeup world.
That you can use to create a winged.
Liner.
Some people like a pencil i do not some.
People like a gel liner with a brush i.
Do not some people like a liquid liner.
With like bristles i sometimes do but.
Really did not what i really like to use.
Is a felt tip liner for today i'm going.
To use the marc jacobs felt tip liner.
Just like this and it's basically a tiny.
Little marker this one is $58 which you.
Definitely do not have to buy i get that.
As ridiculously expensive.
I know maybelline has a literally good.
And so does kat von d but basically.
You're gonna want to use a felt tip.
Liner if you are like me and you.
Struggle with this because it makes it.
So much easier the most common question.
I get when it comes to winged liner is.
How do you get them to be even let's be.
Real we all have days where our.
Eyeliners are like not even distant.
Cousins let alone sisters let alone.
Twins.
But there is one half that i have for.
You guys that's really gonna hopefully.
Step up your eyeliner game and that is.
Follow the shape of your eyes when.
Drawing in the bottom line of your way.
You're gonna want to imagine as if your.
Waterline and continued so as you can.
See here my winder line goes all the way.
Around goes up and then my winged.
Eyeliner looks like it's a continuation.
And it follows that same exact shape and.
Is a slight angle upwards which gives my.
Eyes a nice left a lot of people tend to.
Draw their wings straight out which.
Done correctly can give a really cool.
Editorial look but often times on.
Certain shapes it tends to make the eyes.
Droop and look saggy for some reason a.
Lot of people tend to draw their wings.
Straight up which is literally.
Flattering on nobodies my shape unless.
Your eyes are literal like circles where.
The liner would make sense to keep.
Following the shape please to not draw.
Your eyeliner straight up it does not.
Belong there.
Taking my eyeliner pen and giving it a.
Good shake make sure that there's a lot.
Of product in the bristles i'm going to.
Go towards the corner of my eye and i'm.
Going to kind of rest my elbow on my.
Chest to make sure my arm is not going.
Anywhere and i'm going to start right at.
The outer corner and i'm gonna draw a.
Line upwards following the shape of my.
Waterline similar to the brows if it's.
Messy it's okay because we're gonna.
Clean it up after once i have that.
Bottom line sketch in it we are golden.
We're good to go i'm just gonna take it.
And i'm going to drag the line right.
Back down to the lashes once the wing is.
In place all you have to do is lightly.
Place that felt tip right on the base of.
Your lashes and just lightly drag all.
The way across to finish off that winged.
Liner with a general rule keeping in.
Mind that it should start off a super.
Super thin in the inner corner and get.
Thicker as it gets to this portion and.
Then of course thin out of the weight.
Once we're happy with the overall shape.
Of the wing following the theme of this.
Video now we get to clean it up i'm.
Gonna grab my flat top concealer brush.
Once again a little bit more shaped tape.
Concealer and i'm just going to.
Carefully go right below the wing and.
Carve it out i'm also gonna take the.
Excess concealer on the brush and blend.
It downwards overtop of some of this.
Eyeshadow that ended up back here.
You don't need to do this it's just.
Personal preference that i really like a.
Cut and clean line when it comes to my.
Eye shadow looks of this kind of style.
The hard part is over.
Thank god jumping back into the shadow.
Quickly to finish off the lower lash.
Line we're just gonna replicate the same.
Exact colors that we did on the top on.
The bottom grabbing a little smudger.
Brush this is the emma 213 and the dark.
Purple shade i'm just gonna press this.
Right up against the waterline and then.
Making sure to lightly drag out and.
Connect it with that wing because.
Nothing it looks weirder than when you.
Have shadow blended out and there's just.
Like a harsh divide right here don't do.
That i'm gonna grab that pencil brush i.
Was talking about and dip.
Into the red shadow and he's it to blend.
Out that purple and finally just gonna.
Give an emperor three three and two.
Potential a little bit of orange and a.
Little bit of yellow and just blend.
Right now the last and final step before.
Moving on to the lashes is going to be.
Water lines and if you guys are a true.
Sister you would know that i literally.
Hate them doing my waterline is by far.
My least favorite stabbed and eye makeup.
Routine i hate it i have never liked it.
And if you have sensitive or watery eyes.
Like me you might as well just skip it.
Altogether it has truly saved the life.
Of my makeup routine i have never once.
Wore a black eyeliner and my upper.
Waterline and not have it be.
Ridiculously uncomfortable and transfer.
To my lower lash line by the end of the.
Night so just skip it most helpful.
Makeup tip you'll ever receive as for.
The lower waterline though gal i love.
Her there are so many things you can put.
On there a pop color for a fun look my.
Priscilla favorite is a nude liner this.
One is from pretty vulgar and i just.
Love this using a nude liner in your.
Waterline is gonna really open up your.
Eyes make them pop and make them look.
Bigger you guys know i love a good doll.
Like makeup look and i really really.
Love the new it aforethought as you can.
See it just looks so nice you can of.
Course use a black liner as well for a.
More sultry sexy look but just keep in.
Mind using a black is gonna make your.
Eyes appear smaller so line your.
Waterline accordingly.
And last but finally certainly not least.
Is going to be the lashes the first step.
Of applying lashes is always to give.
Them a good curl using whatever color.
You want i think this one was like $2.
From cvs and the only tip i have for.
This one is make sure you're getting.
Right up to the root of the lash right.
Your lash liner for the best curl our.
Next step of course is gonna be a good.
Coat of mascara and for today's video i.
Am so excited to be partnering with nyx.
Cosmetics to show you guys they're brand.
New worth the hype mascara this is just.
Launched a few weeks ago is available.
Now in most drugstores is literally.
Eight dollars hello and is so good you.
Guys know i don't really do a whole lot.
Of sponsored videos on this channel it.
Is pretty rare for me but i've been.
Testing this mascara out for the past.
Week or so and i really really like it.
And i'm so excited to show you it today.
Going into the wand once again i'm gonna.
Tell my headed back so i have a really.
Easy access.
My lashes i'm gonna start by bringing.
This one in starting right at the root.
Of the lash almost in my upper waterline.
And just wiggling it upwards going from.
Root to tip of the lash and wiggling.
Your wand all around you will also make.
Sure that all of ours are evenly coated.
Which is obviously ideal and as long and.
Beautiful as they can possibly be i.
Really really like this mascara because.
It's of a luminizing mascara and.
Obviously who doesn't love a little bit.
More volume a little bit more dimension.
And their lashes i love a good.
Voluminous mascara but often times it'll.
Leave my lashes looking really really.
Clumpy but as you can see if i look down.
They look nice and separated and so.
Beautiful and also the front of this is.
Really really black which is literally.
The best ever.
Oh look at how good my bottom lashes.
Look oh my god nyx thank you for.
Partnering with you on this video and.
Sisters do you know what to do go check.
It out it's worth the hype okay so if.
You guys are looking for an everyday at.
Natural look when it comes to your.
Lashes at least you could totally stop.
Right here with just a good curl and.
Mascara and looks beautiful and stunning.
But if you're like me and you want a.
Little bit more drama a little bit of a.
Bigger impact today we're gonna do some.
Falsies for today's look i'm gonna go in.
You guessed it the lily lashes in the.
Style of miami these are my all-time.
Favorite false lashes and i really.
Really like them because they're super.
Super wispy they're not too dense so you.
Can still see the eye shadow underneath.
And they're also not too long for my.
Eyes it's really important to keep your.
Actual eye shape and the shape of eyes.
Shadow that you're planning for in mind.
When picking out a pair of lashes.
Obviously there are millions of.
Different styles of lashes out there but.
I like to group them into two different.
Categories which i like to call either.
Symmetrical lashes or asymmetrical.
Lashes lily lashes miami's are.
Symmetrical lashes in my book because at.
The longest point they are all the same.
Exact length an asymmetrical ma should.
Be a lash that is small on the inner.
Corner but the lashes get longer and.
Longer and longer as they go out towards.
The outer portion of your eye and they.
Flare up i definitely prefer wearing.
Asymmetrical last because i feel like it.
Gives a very very doll-like appearance.
It makes your eyes look very very round.
Whereas an asymmetrical lash really.
Accentuates almond eyes and makes them.
Kind of look more like snatched and.
Pulled which is also a really beautiful.
Look as well it just depends on what.
Kind of look you're going for once you.
Have your lashes all picked.
And ready to go i'm gonna grab a pair of.
Tweezers and i'm going to pull them out.
Of the package very very carefully.
Most lashes are pretty expensive so.
You're gonna want to be gentle and.
Pulling them out of the package because.
The last thing that you want to do is.
Spend thirty dollars on a pair of lashes.
And then rip out half the hairs each.
Hair is like 50 cents in here now the.
Absolute biggest mistake that people.
Make when putting on a pair of falsies.
Is taking them right out of the box and.
Popping them right on the eye please do.
Not do that if your lashes are poking.
You if they are tickling you if they are.
Flying off in the inner corner it is.
Because you have an eyelash glued on.
Where there should not be an eyelash.
Glued on nobody has big enough eyes to.
Ever glue on this big of an eyelash to.
Your eye trim your eyelashes and your.
Application and your entire life will be.
A million times better the best way to.
Figure out how to trim your eyelashes.
And what length is going to work best.
For your eye shape is to take them out.
Of the box and put them on your eye but.
Without any glue the tackiness from.
Whatever was sticking at the lash to the.
Box should be enough to keep the lash on.
Your eyelid and kind of get a sense for.
The measurement grab my lashes in the.
Center tightly by a pair of tweezers i'm.
Gonna grab my tiny pair of eyelash.
Scissors and i'm going to trim off the.
Ends for me personally i like to trim.
Off one spike on one and two spikes on.
The other end which deathly made a huge.
Difference in the size and although this.
May look small the other lashes that we.
Put mascara on are gonna do a great job.
Of blending together the false lash with.
The real one and this is gonna look a.
Whole lot better than that.
Overwhelming lash from before to final.
Lashes today i'm going to be using the.
Duo brush on adhesive i love this lash.
Glue this stuff is so bob you need it in.
Your life i'm just gonna go ahead and.
Open it up and paint a light layer of.
Glue right on the lash band this glue.
Dries pretty quickly and it goes on blue.
So once it turns clear you know it's.
Ready to apply so i'm just gonna shake.
It around a little bit and i'm gonna.
Hold a mirror and just like this one.
Kind of below my face at a very very.
Weird angle trust me on this i'm gonna.
Look in my mirror from below me and i'm.
Gonna place the lash on top of my lid.
From an upward.
Angle i'm gonna go to my tweezers and.
Then just pull on both ends and make.
Sure that the actual lash band is in.
Contact with my lash line.
That's why holding the mirror from below.
Is super super helpful because you can.
Actually see what you're doing is that.
I'm just trying to estimate it once our.
Last band is all glued on there we have.
Our last step but probably our most.
Important step and please be careful.
While doing this do not poke your eyes.
Out go in super close up to your eyelid.
With your pair of tweezers and go in and.
Pinch together right up against your.
Lash line the false lashes with your.
Real lashes and doing this is not only.
Gonna make the lashes blend together and.
Look more real but because the mascara.
Is slightly tacky still it's gonna.
Really stick the lashes together so.
You're laughs and will stay on all day.
Long and there you go guys our lashes.
Officially on secured pinch together not.
Going anywhere and looking so so so good.
Lashes like i was saying is by far one.
Of the hardest steps of any makeup.
Routine i struggle with them for so long.
Can't even tell you how many times i.
Glued my eye shot far too many and.
Flashes are saying that you struggle.
With literally just grab a pair of.
Falsies from like cvs or walgreens and.
Just sit in front of your mirror and.
Practice gluing them on with no other.
Makeup on so you don't mess anything up.
And i promise if you try out these.
Strategies and tips and techniques you.
Will eventually get way better at it but.
Once you have it all down we love a good.
Sister lash where their lashes done i.
Think that actually completes our eye.
Look for today so i'm gonna quickly.
Throw on a lip on some setting spray and.
