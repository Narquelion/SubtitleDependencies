One week ago i uploaded a video to my.
Youtube channel titled tati this video.
Was a direct response to the video that.
Tati westberg uploaded to her channel.
Titled by a sister before i say anything.
At all in this video i want to make it.
Very very clear that everything i said.
In that video in regards to it my.
Sentiments towards tati and my apology i.
Stand behind 100% and still rain true i.
Know i got emotional in the video i.
Apologize it was something very very.
Hard for him to deal with especially.
When it came to talking about my very.
Own mother in talk to his video she.
Discusses many of the different reasons.
As to why she was choosing to close a.
Chapter in her life that i was heavily.
Involved in making many of our private.
Issues very very very public and now.
Millions and millions of people have.
Weighed in with their opinions and.
Speculations on subjects that they.
Honestly know absolutely nothing about i.
Will not ask for sympathy and i will.
Definitely not ask for forgiveness.
Either but i will ask that you watch.
This entire thing all the way through.
Before forming any further opinions or.
Talking about this story more hello.
Future james here popping in quickly.
I know doing an insert in a video like.
This is not professional trust me but i.
Filmed this several times now and as.
Time keeps going on more and more things.
Keep coming out into the public and more.
People are speaking on the situation and.
It is very important to me that this.
Video has all the information all the.
Facts all the receipts and is current.
And present because i will not be.
Addressing it again after this matter.
This morning when i was editing this.
Video i noticed that last night totsied.
Uploaded a video to her channel called.
Why i did it and this morning geoffrey.
Starr was on snapchat talking about the.
Whole situation first and foremost i do.
Want to issue a thank you to both.
Jeffrey and tati for taking some of the.
Responsibility for blowing this whole.
Thing up and for starting everything i.
Really respect that a lot and i also.
Appreciate the fact that they are trying.
To redirect the hate away because i.
Think we're all aware at this point that.
It has gotten way too far the past week.
On the internet has been at the darkest.
I think we've all ever seen and it's.
Also been the darkest time that i've.
Ever had to go through and my life and.
My thoughts gone to a really scary place.
Watching takis video it's clear to me.
That she also is in a really dark place.
As well and has been pained by this.
Whole situation if i've known anything.
About talk to you over the past three.
Years it says she has a huge huge heart.
There's no tonight.
And i think that or i do believe her.
When she says that she did not want this.
To get so vile i don't really think any.
Of us thought it's gonna be as big as it.
Really was in both of their videos.
Jeffrey and tati both mentioned that.
They hope that i'm able to change and.
Then we can all move on from the.
Situation and trust me i agree there's.
Nobody that wants it's over with as much.
As i do.
But in takis second video and in jeffrey.
Snapshots they both said that they stand.
Behind everything that they mentioned.
And unfortunately there have been.
Allegations made against me because of.
These things and i don't really feel.
Comfortable just moving on from those i.
Would like to take this video today as.
An opportunity to kind of explain.
Everything that has happened and address.
Literally everything there's a lot that.
Happened behind the scenes leading off.
To talk days video and there's a lot.
That happened behind the scenes and.
Publicly after takis video and i feel so.
It is my responsibility to kind of let.
You guys in on those because there's a.
Lot of misinformation going around and.
It's just not really good just like.
Talking said in her video this whole.
Situation is a lot bigger in the despite.
Immense and i think anybody who's kind.
Of followed the situation is well aware.
Of that at this point trust me i am too.
There are way bigger issues here that i.
Will be discussing and talking openly.
And honestly about later on in this.
Video i have a few notes in front of me.
Here and i want to make sure that i hit.
Every single point and that i don't miss.
Anything but that being said to get to.
Those issues this did start with.
Vitamins it was kind of the catalyst so.
I want to make sure we kind of go in.
Order and you guys are able to get the.
Full context and full story of.
Everything if that has happened starting.
Off my friends and i all tend to.
Coachella weekend one from april 11th.
Through 15th and i had an artist pass.
Provided to me by a brand we had a.
Really really good weekend i mean you.
Guys saw the snapshots instagram.
Pictures and outfits and my video it was.
Really really fun and we will definitely.
Never forget it but at coachella i had.
Drama with a boy that i had been talking.
With for five months prior and it all.
Kind of clouded at the overall memories.
Later on at that very same week on april.
19th my best friends and i in the family.
Group chat made the last-minute decision.
That we wanted to attend coachella.
Weekend to again to kind of relive those.
Memories but boy free i texted my.
Manager jake that very same night asking.
It to be possible to get us in for the.
Next day since it was already friday we.
Nee were missing the first day of the.
Festival so therefore we could only go.
On saturday because it was so at last.
Second we were only able to get vip.
Tickets which is not the same as artists.
But we had it over anyway and wanted to.
Have a really really good time for those.
Of you who may not be familiar with.
Coachella i do want to quickly clarify.
The different passes just because it.
Kind of is important to this whole.
Situation if the ip although vip is.
Still very very open to the public.
Artists passes however our passes that.
You can not buy the only way you can get.
A hold of them is through a brand.
Getting them from the actual festival or.
Through having a personal connection to.
One of the artists or bands that are.
Playing it's in a very very highly.
Secured area that is not open to the.
Public a lot of artist passes though.
There's also something called a.
Performer pass and backstage passes and.
A lot of other things that can keep you.
More protected keep in mind weekend one.
I did have an artist past weekend - i.
Had a vip going into the situation when.
We walked into weekend 2 with me my.
Friends on a saturday april 20th and.
Sunday april 21st we notice that there.
Was a major major difference and at the.
Crowd we were in the vip section and i.
Started getting mobbed really really.
Quickly at a super unsafe capacity.
Because as many of you guys know when.
I've always stopped to take a photo kind.
Of other people tend to come and it just.
Turns into a big situation and it.
Honestly it was not safe i had.
Remembered from weekend one that my.
Friend nikita driving home is with a lot.
Of the time was brought by sugar bear.
Hair and had an artist pass personal.
Security and backstage passes and was.
Very very taken care of and safe what i.
Felt unsafe in the situation i panicked.
And i text nikita and asked her if she.
Had a connection to the sugar bear hair.
Team that could potentially help me out.
Nikita replied right away and she gave.
The sugar bear hair team at my personal.
Phone number to which they reached out.
To me and offered to come rescue me with.
A pass and backstage access and security.
To make sure that i was okay and was.
Able to enjoy the festival along with my.
Friends you went to coachella somehow.
Had a security issue and magically sugar.
Bear hair is there with a contract in.
Hand to save the day for you and all of.
Your friends no company would ever go.
Out of their way to have an extra you.
Know handful of passes that cost.
Thousands of dollars apiece.
Like just in case that leads me to.
Believe that this was orchestrated.
Beforehand but he had an emotional.
Conflict because of me and promises he.
Made.
Me behind the scenes so he had to come.
Up with a very clever story and didn't.
Tell me right when he got back but after.
The little bit was posted on their.
Launch day despite we talked you said in.
Her video of this whole situation was.
Definitely not a big scheme that was.
Orchestrated beforehand it really did.
Happen on the spot the sugar bear hair.
Team texted me their proposal right away.
No money was involved and with no time.
To negotiate in a panic i signed and.
That was out on that james charles he.
Had nine days after coachella to talk to.
Me on monday april 22nd which was one.
Day after coachella i was due to post my.
Stories based on my contract and up.
Until that moment i honestly had not.
Thought about the fact that talk to you.
Was a sugar bear hair a competitor and.
In that moment i thought that as a.
Friend she deserved a courtesy text to.
Let her know the context on the.
Sponsorship and everything that was.
Going on to not even get a phone call to.
Not even get a text a few days prior but.
Right after that sponsored post went up.
To have a text like hey mom love you i'm.
Stressed just so you know xyz i just did.
This post but it's no big before posting.
My stories i actually did text 20 first.
Out of respect for her giving her heads.
Up about the sponsorship but she was.
Immediately upset i try my best to kind.
Of explain the entire situation and also.
Gave her a direct apology as well but at.
This point i had signed the contract and.
I absolutely had to post it there was no.
Getting out of it i then headed to the.
Airport and took off on a flight to san.
Francisco.
By the time that i had landed a one hour.
Later talk to you - uploaded all of her.
Instagram stories of her crying talking.
About the friends the community that.
Haven't really supported her how she was.
Alone and how she felt very very hurt.
And betrayed very quickly people put two.
And two together and realized that this.
Was clearly about me and i started.
Getting thousands and thousands of.
Tweets and comments and texts about the.
Whole situation throughout the next.
Several hours i made countless attempts.
At text both tati and her husband james.
And many phone calls as well trying to.
Reach them all of which they did not.
Respond to and later on that night while.
Sitting in my hotel in san francisco.
Because i could not reach talk to you i.
Assured a public apology directly on my.
Instagram because.
I really wanted to make sure she saw.
That i was sorry and i wanted to end the.
Situation by taking full responsibility.
For my actions over the next several.
Days i made countless attempts to.
Contact both tati and her husband james.
On all their different phone numbers i.
Texted and called a tottie's business.
Number her family number and also.
James's personal phone number as well.
After a full entire week of trying to.
Reach out and handle things in private.
With tati on her husband james and.
Getting no response i figured at this.
Time it'd be best to just respect their.
Space give them their privacy and that.
Whenever talked to is ready she was.
Reached back out to me to handle things.
In private and hopefully move on with.
Our friendship that is everything in.
Regards to the instagram stories that.
We've talked about that i want to.
Discuss a few of the things and talk to.
This video that were misleading and.
False the reason that james always said.
That he couldn't promote halo on his.
Channel and really do like you know.
Heavy endorsement was because he has a.
Teenage audience and it would just be.
Inappropriate now this thing was just.
Confusing to me mostly because this.
Conversation never actually happened if.
You guys know my channel you know that i.
Don't really do dedicated product.
Reviews ever which is what tati is known.
For but even though that is the case i.
Have still multiple times that talked.
About her products are almost social.
Media networks i have to worry okay i.
Forgot to say - hello i'm going to a.
Really important event later on tonight.
My best friend we are going to yes this.
Is true and this is a very important.
Loss to me because it is my best friend.
Mopti it she's launching something new.
On hela beauty i'm super proud of her by.
The tennis videos oh it'll already be up.
So go check it out.
Probably for talk to you love me the.
Most who doesn't need a little beauty.
Boost every now and then - the following.
Statements are real claims made by your.
Original halo beauty booster so oh can i.
Just say i love you guys for putting a.
Halo question in there.
As i just receive a package from a halo.
Beauty this is todd he's a brand-new.
Brand mom i did not tell talk to you.
That i was buying these going to pay for.
These myself because i just wanted to.
Support her and i'm so happy because i.
Know she's worked so hard on these for.
The past several years now.
Congratulations auntie i love you a.
Little you so much i do want to keep.
This video strictly based on facts and.
Receipts but one of the most hurtful.
Things taki did and her video it was.
Bring up my mom and questions her.
Parenting no tears this time my mom is.
The strongest woman i have ever met she.
Is kind she is creative and she is.
Caring she is a cancer survivor and she.
Balances a marriage a full-time job and.
Raising two boys absolutely crazy lives.
She's taught me so much in the past and.
When i made a mistake.
She has never turned to public.
Humiliation as a form of punishment all.
That being said i love my mom and i.
Think she's doing a damn good job if i.
Do say so myself.
The last phone conversation that james.
Charles and i had he said some things.
Telling me about a situation that.
Happened in seattle at my birthday and.
It literally made me want to vomit oh my.
God you tried to trick a straight man.
Into thinking he's gay yet again and.
Somehow you're the victim you know it's.
Really disgusting to manipulate.
Someone's sexuality especially when they.
Are still you know emerging into.
Adulthood and don't quite have.
Everything figured out you are using.
Your fame your power your money to play.
With people's emotions and you're doing.
That to have them behave sexually in.
Your favor even if they're straight and.
You know what that's not okay and how.
Dare you laugh about it and make me.
Master meme and retweet and this and.
That and i love straight boys i love.
Straight boys and make it a joke because.
This behavior is not normal it's not.
Okay.
Cracking someone's sexuality is not an.
Escape room first of all i am a 19 year.
Old virgin i talk about boys quite a lot.
Of my social media networks clearly at.
This point and it's not acceptable.
Anymore.
We're talking about that a little bit i.
Promise you but just thought i would.
Bring it up put it out into the universe.
I don't really get a lot of action.
We have probably guessed this at this.
So that being said i have never and.
Would never and will never use my fame.
Money or power to manipulate or get any.
Sexual actions from a guy that is.
Disgusting it is not me and the fact.
That tati brought this up blows my mind.
Because she knows the real story the.
Story that were talking about here is a.
Situation that happened when i was in.
Seattle for talking surprise party with.
A boy named sam now i'm going to tell.
You the full story since everybody seems.
To be leaving out literally every single.
Detail in talk to each video she.
Mentioned that she was disgusted and had.
To apologize to her family for me.
Apparently saying things that i wanted.
To do to a waiter and then just to find.
Those actions by saying i have a.
Celebrity okay this literally did not.
Happen what did happen is that me.
Jeffrey nate - my best friend drew all.
Flew to seattle to surprise talk to you.
For her birthday on february 14th that.
Night we went out to dinner with that.
With tontine james and her whole family.
And we're in a restaurant there was a.
Cute boy across the restaurant that i.
Kept making eye contact with and that i.
Was interested in and the conversation.
Of dating for me and jeffrey both came.
Up the dinner table and we were talking.
About it for a very very short period of.
Time the conversation never got.
Inappropriate period the boy that was.
Involved in the story is named sam now.
When i originally wanted to do this.
Video addressing everything i did plan.
On crossing his name and keeping him.
Completely private but he has since come.
Out and made a video of his oh not.
Talking about the situation just like.
Talk to you leading out many many.
Details but in his video and in the.
Screenshots that i have sam mentioned.
That he was perfectly fine and found the.
Flirting that i was doing flattering so.
I'm not really sure why this got turned.
Into something much bigger but it simply.
Was not he was looking at me later on.
That night he started asking me if i had.
A valentine this is this was on.
Valentine's day where he especially.
Thought that i was very attractive and.
He wanted to get my phone.
And all that but the waitstaff at my.
Restaurant didn't let that happen.
He left and it kind of just went and.
Talked about the imus liberty thing is.
Really incredibly frustrating to me.
Because this is an inside joke between.
My friends and i had that tati is also.
Participated in and she twisted this to.
Be something far worse than what it is.
This is the joke that really is where we.
Say i'm famous not i'm a celebrity and.
It's thing that we don't say it in.
Public very often because without.
Context i get it it looks and sounds.
Really really bad trust me literally.
Famous is synonymous of anything good so.
Yeah my youtube video does well one day.
My friends was like oh my god james are.
So famous but literally if my friend.
Takes a good instagram photo oh my god.
You're so famous if our boneless buffalo.
Wings that chili's are extra delicious.
One day oh my god these wings are so so.
Famous it has nothing to do at all with.
Fame power or money which is what tati.
Eluded it to being and it is so.
Frustrating that she turned an innocent.
And funny inside joke that she has.
Participated in into something so beyond.
Disgusting i'm going to try my best to.
Make it a long story very short the next.
Day sampson into my dms first and i.
Happened to see it we started talking.
Back and forth and he mentioned that he.
Was flattered by me flirting with him at.
The night before head sorry about last.
Night you're very attractive and then i.
Was very flattering actually a few.
Minutes into the conversation i asked.
About his sexuality and he told me.
Straight up that he was bisexual oh my.
God you tried to trick a straight man.
Into thinking he's gay there was no.
Straight man at being manipulated.
Anywhere in this story like tati.
Mentioned later on in the conversation.
He asked when i was leaving seattle and.
I told him the next morning to which he.
Responded i wish we had time to hang out.
And i said hey why do you come over to.
My hotel tonight we can watch a movie.
Together.
He said sounds good later on he messaged.
Me first and told me hey straight up.
I've never done anything with a guy.
Before i'm a little bit nervous too.
Which i told him there was absolutely no.
Pressure this is all shown in the.
Screenshots sam showed up at the hotel.
We watched movies together and we.
Cuddled after the movie i asked him if.
He wanted to kiss to which he said yes i.
Get to the hotel room we say hi it's all.
Fine we had watching a movie and.
After that movie he asked to kiss me i.
Said yes and we ended up making out for.
Around an hour and if i'm being honest.
He's the worst kisser i've ever kissed.
Way too much time all right.
Note taken um after making out sam for.
Over an hour i did invite him to sleep.
Over at the hotel and he kept telling.
You to stay like please say please say.
Don't leave me all this knob and i.
Really wanted to go home.
So i left of course i want to spend more.
Time with him but he said that he wanted.
To go home and be in his own bed and.
Think about everything that was going on.
Because it was quite a lot and i.
Definitely understood and did not blame.
Him he then left and sent me a message.
Afterwards thanking you for being so.
Understanding and i told him that i.
Would always be there for him if he.
Needed literally anything point being.
Everything that happened in the hotel.
Room was 100% consensual and this is.
Confirmed i said yes by the only two.
Parties that were actually they are.
Being myself and sam after this night.
Sam when i continued to talk for the.
Next several weeks at first it was.
Really really great.
But i noticed that his feelings towards.
Me and sexuality were kind of wavering.
Quite a lot and i came to the collusion.
That he needed to figure himself out and.
That i needed to move on because i kept.
Getting hurt last important note to keep.
In mind about the timeline of the whole.
Situation on may 2nd sam texted me from.
His friend's phone saying that he was.
Fully gay i needed to talk to me about.
Something important i called him and.
Instead talking about that he asked me.
If i was talking to another guy at the.
Same time that i was talking to him i.
Was a little bit confused as to i as.
Being asked this but i did answer him.
Honestly and then i asked him what made.
Him come to conclusion with everything.
To what she said.
I'm actually not fully okay after doing.
This a million times i was frustrated.
And i hung up just to clarify so there.
Are no further questions the point of.
Including this screenshot is not to out.
Sam sam texted me saying he was fully.
Gay but it was a trap to get me on.
Facetime so he could illegally record.
The conversation to include in the video.
That he was planning later on like i.
Said at the end of the conversation i.
Asked and how he came to this conclusion.
And then he told me he was not fully gay.
To which i hung up out of frustration.
Later on he texted me saying he was.
Confirmed by this is why in sam's video.
He included a screenshot of me telling.
Him i did not think he was fully.
Straight this comment had a lot of.
People really up.
And confused as to why i was telling.
Somebody their sexuality but there's a.
Very simple explanation stan when i.
Talked for a very very long time and his.
Sexuality like i said wavered a lot.
Every time that he was a little bit.
Confused we had open and honest.
Conversations about it and he always.
Asked me of my input and i gave it to.
Him i would never out somebody and i.
Have never ever tried to manipulate.
Somebody's sexuality including his.
Point-blank period the whole situation.
That happened with sam was very very.
Long and complicated and left both of us.
Very hurt and confused and through.
Trying to do this i reached out to many.
Of my different friends for advice um.
There was one night in my kitchen where.
Tatia james and gabriel all came over.
And i told them the same exact story and.
Showed them the same exact screenshots.
To all of you guys just saw after.
Hearing this like tati said in her video.
Tati and james actually did have a.
Heart-to-heart conversation with me.
About the boys that i could involve with.
They told me that talking to curious.
Guys was going to continue to get me.
Hurt and that also it could look really.
Really bad from an outside perspective.
If somebody tried to manipulate the.
Situation and for me this is a major.
Major wake-up call that i took to heart.
Because i honestly had never thought.
About it and any other way because i.
Knew that everything that i was doing.
Was always consensual between both me.
And the boy and i had receipts to back.
It up but i wished i knew at the time.
That todd his advice was really a.
Warning because she did exactly what she.
Told me someone else may which was.
Telling my story with no details no.
Facts and no proof and twisted around.
And now serious allegations have.
Surfaced that could permanently damage.
My career now like i said the talk that.
Happened in my kitchen i really did.
Appreciate because it was the first time.
I kind of took a step back and was able.
To analyze what was going on and this.
Week has been a major eye-opener for me.
As well i want to take a brief moment to.
Talk about boys boys have obviously met.
A talent that has been discussed quite.
In detail on my youtube channel and.
Social media networks this is no secret.
I wish it hadn't been but if i'm gonna.
Talk about at one last time i definitely.
Want to be open and honest with you guys.
The ones who matter i got out of the.
Closet as gay at age 12 which is.
Honestly really really young to kind of.
Figure all of that out i have two other.
Boys at school at the time who were gay.
But we were all close friends so nothing.
Was happening there if you know what i.
Mean but all my other friends were.
Having their first kiss underneath the.
Playground slide or getting into their.
First relationship and talking all about.
It.
And for me i was on poptropica and.
Social media networks trying to make.
Friends and trying to find out what else.
I was interested in i never really got.
The opportunity to experiment with love.
And learn from that as a growing.
Teenager and i think that that's.
Honestly left me kind of underdeveloped.
As a person in a lot of different ways.
I've been forced to grow very very.
Quickly because of the job that i work.
In in social media which i know excited.
Million times beforehand but love and.
Relationships is something that i have.
Barely any experience in and i honestly.
Think that that's why i'm a lot less.
Mature than others maybe in the.
Situations that i get myself into um i.
Definitely am emotional and i like it.
The best me sometimes i can be dramatic.
I'm reactive i'm forward i'm flirty and.
These are qualities that i'm not.
Necessarily proud of at all but i can.
Confidently say that with each.
Experience i'm learning more and more.
And i've been able to better myself but.
A lot of times these situations have.
Become public my own fault my own fault.
But having millions of people watching.
You learn can be very very tricky when.
It comes to experiences that i've.
Learned from in the past a lot of times.
I've talked about being in two straight.
Guys now this conversation is saying.
That has upset and also confused quite a.
Lot of people so in order to provide a.
Little bit more context i would like to.
Play a clip from todd his friend jeffrey.
Starr's video titled the truth about my.
Relationship but a single for a long.
Time and the reason why is because i am.
Really not attracted to anyone but what.
We call in this world as a straight male.
Or a normal dude and what i mean by that.
Is like you know i am really into.
Straight guys and i know that is going.
To not be surprising to a lot of you so.
You know from just travelling everywhere.
And meeting dudes all the time and being.
Around that world for so long i really.
Kind of fell into a trap of always being.
Someone that was kept like the secret.
And when you are someone like me who is.
You know i get asked all the time even.
Every day on my channel you guys i get.
Comments are you a guy are you a girl.
Are you transgender are you trying to.
Transition what are you being someone.
That is like me that is a guy that looks.
Like a woman right i keep doing this.
Because so many people are not into.
Labels these days and i love that i'm.
All about that you do you call yourself.
Whatever you want whatever you believe.
In i think that is the beauty and the.
Freedom of you know living is we can be.
Whoever we want to be i have always been.
Into straight men and the problem with.
That my entire life is i never found.
Real love because straight men behind.
Closed doors they love people like me.
They love hooking up they love having.
Fun.
They love the relationship as long as.
Other people don't know i really like.
The stuff from jeffrey's video because.
Not only is everything in it very.
Accurate but i honestly feel like he did.
A great job of explaining a topic that.
Is very confusing and complex and then.
Not a lot of people understand including.
Me fully to be honest yes as a gay man i.
Am attracted to men and in the past.
Whenever i have found a guy cute on.
Instagram or on social media i have.
Stood in the dm's of the simple hello or.
A nice compliment if anybody ever made.
It clear that they were not interested.
Or were not gay and didn't want to talk.
I always apologized for the unwanted.
Attention and the conversation was put.
To a halt immediately i do take full.
Responsibility for sending these.
Messages in this situation has.
Definitely taught me that sending.
Messages that are so for and direct like.
This are unacceptable and i no longer.
Will do that moving forward a few.
Different guys that i've talked to in.
The past have since came forward with.
Their stories or posted screenshots of.
Conversations that i had with them.
Saying that i made them feel.
Uncomfortable and reading some of them i.
Honestly felt really really bad i.
Reached out to all the boys directly and.
Apologize to them for my actions but.
Aside from those few guys people are.
Treating a hashtag jam chavez over party.
As an open invitation to add to the.
Narrative with lies which is not only.
Harmful to me but it's also creating.
Very very dangerous stereotypes around.
The lgbtq+ community for example zara.
Larsson who's a pretty big singer.
Tweeted saying that i messaged her.
Boyfriend multiple times knowing he was.
Straight and this tweak on almost half a.
Million likes before it was deleted in.
Her defense she did later on say there.
Was only one message but it was way too.
Late because the media had already ran.
With it saying that i was harassing.
Straight men and wouldn't leave him.
Alone had i known that he was dating.
Zara larsson i clearly never would have.
Messaged him in the first place but this.
Is all very hypocritical considering and.
This is how's our larson found her.
Boyfriend i'd like to pose a question to.
You the audience.
Why is it okay for zara larsson a woman.
With the public platform to tweet these.
Photos of a shirtless man and say who.
Are you where do you live how old are.
You why are you so fine how do you like.
Your eggs cooked in the morning but for.
Me as a gay man to dm the same person in.
Private with a simple compliment is.
Predatory these stereotypes are on gay.
Men had been and continue to be very.
Very harmful to the community and have.
Been historically used to villainize gay.
Men in society someone completely.
Fabricated a whole entire story about me.
Touching another boy at a high school.
Journal and it blew up this person that.
Came forward a few days later saying.
That it was a social experiment but it.
Was too late people also completely.
Photoshopped twitter dms of me reaching.
Out to these people threatening legal.
Action if they were to tweet more things.
When in reality i have literally not.
Even met on social media and i deleted.
The twitter app from my phone so all.
These things are just so false and are.
So fake and it's truly disgusting.
Also pretty much every boy that i've.
Ever even communicated with at this.
Point is posting screenshots of our.
Conversation at to make a spectacle of.
Me i've dealt with so many fake stories.
In the past from coachella the fake sex.
Tape and now this and i'm done i'm done.
Being the subject of these bandwagon.
Stories for length it's not okay now.
That we've addressed and cleared the air.
On the boys let's get back to our.
Thailand because somehow there's still a.
Whole lot more to this story and more.
Claims as well in toc2 video she said.
That she felt she needed to bring all.
This to the public eye because people.
Need to just know what's going on behind.
The scenes and i truly cannot believe.
That i'm about to bring up what i'm.
Going to bring up but i feel the same.
Exact way on monday may sex that jeffrey.
Posted this tweet to his twitter which i.
Honestly started getting tagged in after.
This tweet and a few other ones from him.
And his friends i decided to reach out.
To him and asked if there was something.
Going on and that i should be aware of.
He replied to me and he said that it was.
Not about me and that it was about.
Another brand stealing his ideas this.
Message was in a voice memo which has.
Since disappeared from the screenshot.
You'll just have to believe me i have.
Literally no reason to lie at this point.
Even though he said it wasn't about me i.
Still asked to talk to him but he said.
He was unavailable a few hours later.
While i was getting ready to forth and.
Back down.
This text from jeffrey concerned but.
Mostly really really confused i reached.
Out to him about meeting together in.
Private and hopes to speak together and.
Figure out the best understanding but he.
Didn't reply.
Three days later still no response i.
Decided to reach out again but he was.
Not available to talk i flew to.
Australia on may 8th and on may 10th.
Hours before my scheduled meeting.
Reappearance where five thousand fans.
Were already waiting outside i was open.
Up at four in the morning by my friend.
Because tonti had just uploaded a video.
Titled by a sister watching talk to his.
Video it was very clear to me that my.
Friend was still very hurt and even.
Though i had already apologized both.
Privately and publicly i wanted to make.
A video right then and there with my raw.
And honest emotions but because of the.
Time difference it took me the extra few.
Hours to film the video and get it up.
And by the time i was about to hit.
Publish.
I received an another text from jeffrey.
Star i've already cleared up sam and our.
Nights together being a hundred percent.
Consensual he was absolutely not trapped.
At a hotel room but jeffrey also brings.
Up zack zack is his boyfriend nate's.
Brother and not only did i not pursue.
Zack who identifies his mainly straight.
But it was actually jeffrey who.
Suggested that i talk to him in the.
First place maintenance brother is.
Single and mainly strange alright after.
Ali moved here work zack and i talked on.
South chat for maybe a total of 10.
Selfies parking port to each other he.
Was super super sweet but it was very.
Clear to me that he was not actually.
Interested and the conversation stopped.
Before anything could even get remotely.
Flirty at all with everything going on i.
Did not reply to jeffrey's text in the.
Moment a few days later on monday i woke.
Up again in the middle of the night from.
A phone call my little brother ian who.
Was very very upset he's only he had.
Tweeted saying why do people act so.
Tough online about somebody from his.
Hometown who was bullying him and a.
Jeffrey star of all people had quote.
Tweeted ian's tweet saying why is her.
Brother a predator why don't you really.
Move back to new york city exactly shut.
The    up many people were quick to.
Call out jeffrey for bullying a kid who.
Had nothing to do with the situation.
Literally at all and he deleted it the.
Tweet after this i went to check my.
And notice that jeffrey had texted me a.
Few minutes prior and i opened my phone.
To this i really want to read this text.
Out loud just so you all get to hear.
Exactly what i had to read but also so i.
Don't miss anything.
Grayson is going on camera shortly to.
Finally tell the world how you tried to.
Molest him and touch him in his sleep.
And made him uncomfortable for months.
You sick.
Next zach will be going on camera to.
Tell how twisted and sick you were.
Trying to get him to like you and then.
Make him feel bad what he didn't want to.
Send you photos back then sam from.
Seattle will be joining me in cameron to.
Talk about you trapping him in his hotel.
Room.
You need to be locked in prison for a.
Very long time you need the internet.
Taken away from you you are a danger to.
Society as disgusting as it is i have to.
Admit bringing up graceland dolan was.
Pretty clever at the height of all these.
Allegations and stories going around.
Both of the twins unfollowed me not.
Wanting to be associated and fans.
Started speculating that the rumors.
Could be as to why.
Too bad that aside from our pre-planned.
Collaborative jokes that happen did the.
Sisters want videos of me and grayson.
Flirting nothing ever happened between.
Us and when all this went down.
I knew jeffrey was lying because the.
Twins were two of the first people to.
Call me and make sure that i was okay i.
Already mentioned zach and i still have.
No idea who the cameron at jeffrey's.
Referring to in this message is but he.
Also brought up sam last who he also.
Already talked about later on that day.
Though jeffrey was right sam did upload.
A video to his youtube channel telling.
The whole story he left out almost all.
The details and included an illegally.
Recorded facetime call which was on may.
2nd told you'd remember that but even.
Through all of this he still managed to.
Get the point across that our.
Interactions were 100% consensual next.
Was jeffrey's tweets my little brother.
Ian now i did say that this video was.
Going to be solely based on facts and i.
Of course can't prove what jeffrey was.
Trying to imply here and i don't want to.
Put words into his mouth but since it's.
Now open for speculation might as well.
Clear the air he had actually went home.
For a few different reasons but it's.
Temporary he had to get his with some.
Teeth taken out and he's also working on.
Different modeling opportunities in new.
York city and i am so incredibly proud.
Of.
But he was also having a really really.
Hard time in la dealing with a public.
Breakup and negativity online sent him.
Into diagnosed clinical depression which.
He is now being treated for and he.
Wanted to be with my parents nothing.
More.
Last but finally not least jeffrey.
Posted this tweet claiming he hadn't.
Seen me since february and that nate.
Banned me from their home now this.
So-called ban is the first time i'm ever.
Hearing of this and i just think it's.
Really funny that jeffrey brought this.
Up could starting the fact that he's.
Tweeted me twice and between february.
And now saying that he missed me.
Regardless he ended that tweet first.
Thing i was a danger to society and.
Everything in takis video was 100% true.
Adding insult to injury.
Not only did jeffrey texted me but he.
Also went out of his way to text my best.
Friend drew this lovely message trying.
To turn him against me jeffrey's.
Messaging about me both in private and.
In public was hurtful to fam'ly torrey.
Extremely excessive but most importantly.
Literally all based on lies i wish i.
Knew why he was doing all this but at.
The same time his track record with.
Public views makes under this a surprise.
Totti made a video telling stories about.
Me and publicly humiliating me and now i.
Have serious allegations against me that.
Could be detrimental to my career hello.
Future games here popping in again i've.
Been completely honest my whole timeline.
Thus far and i obviously want to keep.
Doing so so i feel like it is only fair.
To mention that only within the past few.
Days it pretty much everyone involved.
With this situation has started to reach.
Out to me in some way shape or form.
Say i'm cook the boy from seattle has.
Called me nine times and sent me a few.
Different text messages about the.
Situation and trying to make things.
Right.
Totti and her husband james have tried.
To reach out in order to schedule an.
Meeting but only through a mutual.
Youtube rep that we share and i'd also.
Heard from that same person that jeffrey.
Was open to a meeting as well this whole.
Thing has just been really difficult for.
Me because throughout the past three.
Weeks literally all i've wanted and all.
I asked for was for communication from.
These people and i tried really really.
Hard to get that and i did it so i.
Declined the meetings because i felt.
Like this was started publicly and it.
Was addressed publicly and i felt like.
It was only fair.
For me to address as publicly as well.
Before meeting behind the scenes and.
Talking further that sucks to say.
Because i still have love for these.
People and i hope that one day we all.
Can sit down together in a meeting for.
Closure and also to discuss how in the.
Future if problems do come up we can.
Talk in private.
With only us involved but right now i.
Just need time and space to kind of get.
My head back to where it needs to be and.
Get my mental health back together.
Before i kind of rekindle those.
Friendships because everything that.
Happens still really really hurt and i i.
Like wouldn't wish what i went through.
Upon even my worst enemy no matter how.
Angry i was i've always tried to use my.
Platform to spread positivity but i feel.
Like at this point it's my.
Responsibility to be honest with you.
Guys and tell you that the last few.
Weeks of my life has literally been the.
Most painful time that i've ever had to.
Deal with and my head and brain for a.
Hot minute went to a place so dark that.
I didn't think that i was going to come.
Back from and i thought i can't believe.
I just mitad that on camera.
People always say that being a.
Social-media influencer is an easy job.
And this is some that i've talked about.
Time and time to time to get on youtube.
We get it but i don't think any human.
Being ever is prepared mentally or.
Physically to deal with the pain and.
Anxiety of what it feels like to have.
Millions and millions of people talking.
To you at one time having to read the.
Hundreds of thousands of tweets and the.
Youtube videos and the articles about me.
And my character and my family based on.
Things that were almost all lies like it.
Messed me up it messed me up.
Is the best way that i can put it and.
Through all of this i've learned that if.
I can get through this i can get through.
Anything.
Joy getting in on bandwagon hate and.
Cancel culture is incredibly incredibly.
Toxic and it's very concerning to me.
That as a society we're becoming okay.
With guilty until proven innocent.
Instead of the other way around i truly.
Hope that everyone who participated in.
This whether it be fans influencers java.
Channels or credible newest sources take.
The time to think about your words and.
The impact that they may have on others.
Because i assure you and i promise you.
It's a lot stronger than you might you.
May think right now i have a lot of.
Positive changes that i want to work on.
In my life first and foremost i really.
Want to focus more on spending time in.
Person with the people that i love and.
Care about the absolute most and i also.
Have a lot of work to do in terms of.
Getting my mental health box where it.
Needs to be what's now when you guys.
Class my parents and little brother just.
Got to la this morning and we all got to.
Hug and be together as a family for the.
First time in a while and all my closest.
Friends that are not on my payroll may i.
An are all here too we're celebrating my.
Birthday next week.
I'm turning 20 gross many of you guys.
Noticed that the socialists apparel.
Website was down i was so excited about.
A lot of the things that.
Not coming very very soon and just the.
Lion in general i am so grateful for all.
Of your guys's love and support on it it.
Was really really fun to work on i also.
Love the team that i worked on it with.
But unfortunately i had a sever ties.
With killer mercs i just don't see a.
World that exists where i could ever be.
In business with the team ran by someone.
Like geoffrey star if you placed an.
Order on the website before it went down.
Everything will still be fulfilled don't.
Worry you'll get your items and if you.
Got a gift card beforehand make sure you.
Hold on to it because the balance will.
Be valid whenever we reopen because we.
Are coming back i promise.
In regards to the sisters tour which.
Have gone quite a lot of questions about.
Despite the ticket scandal we are almost.
Completely sold out nationwide and that.
Is mind blowing to me and i'm so.
Grateful i know there's been a lot of.
Emails and speculation as of right now i.
Unfortunately do not have a full answer.
On what is happening with the tour but i.
Will have an update for you guys by the.
End of this week i promise going on tour.
Has been a dream of mine for so long now.
And i really want this to happen i just.
Feel like meeting you guys hugging you.
And just getting to thank you.
Face-to-face for what you've done for me.
Is exactly what i need in my heart right.
Now but at the same time towards a lot.
And it's a big big commitment and i want.
To make sure that i know what i'm.
Getting into and that when i walk on.
Stage every night it's with a genuine.
Smile and you guys can feel that and.
You're able to smile as well so i'll.
Keep you posted as for my youtube.
Channel i decided that i'm gonna be.
Taking some much-needed time away from.
Content production on my last few videos.
I've definitely noticed quite a lot of.
Comments talking about my ego or my.
Attitude getting the best of me and.
Getting to my head and i appreciate the.
Constructive criticism and feedback and.
After a lot of reflection i think you're.
Right.
I've lost focus and that sucks so much.
But i want to get back to it so badly.
And i want to get back to my original.
Goal when i have no motivation other.
Than just creating original content and.
That'll happen for sure and i already.
Have some great ideas in the works but.
It's just gonna take a little bit of.
Time ask my other social videos i pledge.
To myself that i'm going to try to power.
Down as much as i can i'm sure i'll be.
Checking here and there of course but i.
Do really want to focus more on.
In-person time and the people around me.
That are loving and caring and that.
Includes all of you guys whenever i do.
Come back i don't know what it is but i.
Just cannot wait to show you guys a.
Better person with me i want to end this.
Video today with two things an apology.
And a thank you to my sisters i'm sorry.
If i disappointed you and i'm really.
Starting how to watch all this go down.
You saw a side of me that i'm really not.
Proud of and that i know i need to work.
On changing and trust me i will be i.
Recognize the fact that i haven't always.
Been the best role model and that sucks.
I've tried but i will try way harder but.
Also to my sisters thank you thank you.
For the messages and the tweets and the.
Emails and the comments that i've.
Received over the past week making sure.
That i was okay and the same thank you.
Goes out to all the fans that were.
Concerned but offer constructive.
Criticism in hopes that i'd be better it.
Does not go unnoticed and you guys.
Helped fill my heart with love what i.
Truly didn't think anything would be.
Able to the same thank you also goes out.
To all my influence her friends that.
Reached out to me in private to make.
Sure i was okay during all of this when.
I felt like the entire world hated me it.
Was really comforting to know that there.
Were other people that understood the.
Situation that were willing to show.
Their love i know who you are you know.
Who you are and one day i'll make sure.
That all of you guys know who they are.
As well i think that is all i got at.
This point thank you for watching if you.
Meet all the way to the end and in the.
Spirit of turning something negative.
Into a positive my sister.
