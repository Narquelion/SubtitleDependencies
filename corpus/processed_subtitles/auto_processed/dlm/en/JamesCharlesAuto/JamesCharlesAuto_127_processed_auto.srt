Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel oh if.
You really thought we were done with.
Just those brushes you were wrong sister.
In case you guys been living under a.
Rock living legend kylie jenner just.
Released a ton of brand-new products to.
Her makeup line for the holiday season.
Not only did she released two eyeshadow.
Palettes but she also sent the beauty.
World into flames and she announced her.
$360 luxury brush set i just interview.
On that in the last video so if you have.
Not yet checked out my brand new video.
On that make sure to click right up here.
But she also launched a full line of.
Concealers just like always that ever.
Kylie's name was attached there has been.
A ton of controversy on these babies.
Right up in here so i got my hands on.
The full line of all 30 concealers and.
Today we're gonna put them to the test.
You guys know that i am a loyal stan of.
The tape tape concealer i love this and.
I use this all the time and almost every.
Single look but not even gonna lie i am.
Getting a little bit bored of having the.
Same exact makeup routine at every.
Single time i have another point right.
Now where i just want to be more.
Creative and try out new products so who.
Knows maybe this concealers will be.
Amazing but we're about to find out just.
To clarify as usual when it comes to.
Reviews because you guys know some.
People are crazy in that comment section.
This video is not sponsored i am not.
Being paid to say anything.
I love kylie but i'm not on her br list.
So this is completely unbiased even.
Playing field these might be amazing it.
These might suck we're gonna find out.
Together.
We're laut further ado let's go ahead.
And jump into the review.
Music.
So before we actually go into the our.
Makeup routine today let's go ahead and.
Talk about the actual product itself so.
The day that i'm filming this is.
December 13 i'm not exactly sure when.
This video it's gonna go but it should.
Be up relatively soon after that but the.
Skin concealers launched today on kylie.
Cosmetics and she says they are.
Lightweight and designed to give a.
Flawless skin line finish contrary to.
Kylie's absolutely ridiculous price tag.
On her breasts at these consumers will.
Be retailing for $20 each on her website.
When these lunch which i actually feel.
Is a very very fair price.
Looking at sephora i'm looking at other.
Concealer prices like the nars radiant.
Creamy concealer i think it's $30 urban.
Decay naked skin i think is 29 the nars.
Soft concealer is 30 kat von d is 26.
Makeup forever is 34 and cosmetics is 24.
And i believe shape tape is 28 to find.
Correct so this is definitely honestly.
On the lower end of some of the.
Concealer price tags this is the.
Component it comes in and based on the.
Bottom of the package it comes with a.
Point 22 fluid ounces of product in.
Comparison to shape tape my shape tape.
Has point 33 fluid ounces of products so.
You get a little bit more in this and.
Then the very popular color pop no.
Filter concealer comes with only point.
14 fluid ounces so this is probably a.
Middle of the line when it comes to.
Actual amount of product that you're.
Given moving on let's go ahead and talk.
About the shade range because that has.
Also been a very very controversial.
Subject of this launch.
So kylie's concealers launched with 30.
Different shades starting with the shade.
Of pearl in the top left with the.
Lightest shade and the bottom right.
Shade being a cocoa which is the darkest.
Looking at the contrast between the.
Lightest shade and the darkest shade.
Together i think that this contrast is.
Honestly very very impressive there's.
Obviously a huge lack of diversity and.
The makeup industry and i really wish.
Brands was hard to recognize more people.
Of color bloggers there are so many.
Beautiful and talented ones out there.
That deserve equally as much cosmetic.
Recognition i really wish it wasn't the.
Case for a shade this dark is like.
Something to applaud over but like i.
Said the laka diversity and the beauty.
Industry has caused it to be so honestly.
Good job sister kylie for doing this.
Obviously a few months ago rihanna.
Chopped her fmt beauty line which.
Literally had the entire nation shook.
She had 40 different colors in her.
Foundation which i think was so so.
Incredible and honestly i think she set.
The standard for future launches.
Literally every time i go into sephora.
At this point most of the middle section.
And literally the entire darker section.
Of the fanta beauty line is always sold.
Out what you think is so.
So great but a lot of people are.
Comparing this launch of kylie's.
Concealers to fenty beauty's foundation.
Having darker foundation chains has.
Always been a major issue for a lot of.
Huge beauty brands and i think fenty.
Vidi has now really changed the game.
When it comes to shade range a lot of.
People are very very angry with kylie.
And a lot of people are saying that.
She's just copying rihanna and my.
Opinion it feels a little bit weird to.
Fight in favor of a really really large.
Shade range which is really really great.
But that have kylie come out with her 30.
Different shades and then turn around.
And say that she's doing it wrong and.
Get angry with her forehead i don't know.
Though i am definitely not at a place to.
Be showing my opinions about this and i.
Don't want to speak over anybody so i'm.
Definitely looking forward to watching.
Hopefully jackie i know alyssa ashley.
Unnie batangas video about these.
Concealers because i really want to hear.
What they have to say quickly before we.
Begin i want to swatch for you guys the.
Lightest and darkest shades just to show.
The contrast first we have the lightest.
Shade of kylie's concealer which is the.
Shade pearl then we have the latest.
Shade of shape tape which is fair and.
Then finally we have color pops latest.
Shade which is in the shade a fair five.
Out of the three of these kylie's of the.
Lightest and then we have the darker.
Shades and just to clarify these.
Swatches are not to help anybody find.
The right color this is simply just to.
Show contrast first we have kylie's.
Darkest shade which is called cocoa then.
We have a tarte shape tape which is in.
The shade mahogany and then finally we.
Have color pop in the shade of wrench 75.
Your cars out of all these once again it.
Kylie's is the darkest whoa that took a.
Very very long time and now that we have.
All the logistics out of the way and you.
Guys know all the details let's go ahead.
And actually put this concealer to the.
Test.
Originally on her snapchat she said that.
They were definitely lightweight and.
Buildable for a very very natural type.
Look so that's exactly what i'm gonna do.
Today i am gonna be filming it a little.
Bit with a very very fun friend so i do.
Want to do a kind of more like glam look.
As opposed to something super intense so.
I'm just starting off by priming my skin.
Using the mac stroke cream in the shade.
Like the gold one just for very very do.
We look for foundation i'm using my too.
Faced born this way foundation in the.
Shade nude and i'm gonna doing just a.
Light layer of this i'm not gonna go.
Full intense coverage like i normally do.
So i brought up my tarte shave deep in.
The shade light which is one that i.
Always use to my everyday makeup routine.
And by looking at the collection i.
Determined that my best shade is.
Probably gonna be.
Gypsum i'm just going to go into this.
Concealer in place and.
My normal location starting off under my.
Eyes i'm also gonna pull this down my.
Nose bridge as always because you guys.
Know that i like to it snatch the nose.
In comparison to say page just because i.
Know that that's what i use in a lot of.
You guys use as well it is definitely a.
Lot more light weight when i put it on.
It doesn't feel so like clunky but.
Hopefully that doesn't mean that the.
Coverage won't be as good let's go ahead.
And blend in oh wow.
Okay actually blends out really really.
Easily damn okay kylie did not come to.
Play i don't know if you guys can really.
Tell on camera with all these lights but.
Obviously you guys know that i talk with.
A lot of expression in my face and i.
Just raised my eyebrows a little bit to.
Set underneath my eyes and now i have.
Really really bad creases so hopefully.
This consider doesn't get too crazy and.
When i set it with powder it'll fix.
Itself i'm gonna grab a lighter.
Concealer in the shade stole from the.
Collection and i'm just gonna put this.
Right in the inner corners underneath my.
Eyes just to try to build up the.
Coverage a little bit and brighten.
Because i feel like the lash eight i use.
Which was gypsum was a little bit too.
Close to my natural skin tone not even.
Being dramatic this actually blends out.
Like a dream like this is going on very.
Very smoothly it's not picking up any of.
The foundation underneath and definitely.
It's like pretty decent coverage too i.
Know it says light carpet on it but i.
Actually feel like this might be more of.
A medium coverage and if it is light.
It's definitely buildable because as you.
Guys saw when they out of that second.
Layer it definitely added a lot more.
Pigment and my under eye bags are like.
Literally gone and i got i think three.
Hours of sleep last night so this is.
Kind of a pressed that before we start.
Cruising all over i'm just going to.
Blend out below my eyes and then grab my.
Translucent powder and my beauty blender.
And just underneath there to make sure.
It is in place i'm also gonna pack this.
On my nose set up the forehead to make.
Sure i don't get any crusty wrinkles and.
Then just using access to go over thrust.
My face not going in too intense because.
I do want it to be kind of doing today.
And not too matte but obviously we want.
Our makeup to say on looking in the.
Mirror i absolutely love how this works.
So far i was able to layer up the cover.
So it looks super super nice my under.
Eye bags are literally gone honestly it.
Looks really belief flawless i'm so.
Pleasantly surprised.
I didn't think they're gonna be bad but.
I was not ready for this shape tape.
Maybe quaking by the end of this video.
But obviously we have a lot more to go.
But the one thing that i will say.
And with the amount of light going on.
And skin swilly filters there is no way.
That you're gonna be able see this on.
Camera but it is here you're just kind.
Of trust me on this one i promise if you.
Are a fellow glasses wearer like me you.
Know those red circles that we get right.
Up in here on the nose bridge from other.
Classes sound your nose there's.
Literally like permanently embedded into.
My face i can kind of see the circles.
Peeking through on both sides the.
Concealer does not cover them fully but.
Then again this does not claim to be a.
Full coverage concealer so it's.
Definitely not a deal-breaker.
All right guys the other my face is all.
Set in place and ready to go i'm gonna.
Go ahead and finish them off my makeup.
Routine and then i'll be right back to.
Do a little check it and then i'm gonna.
Wear this for a few hours and we're.
Gonna put it to the test it looks really.
Great right now but who knows and a few.
Hours that may be creepy and gross and.
Completely worn off we're gonna have to.
Find out alright scissors it has been.
About one hour now and i just finished.
Out my makeup like i said i was gonna go.
For this light everyday look i added.
Some fake freckles and no lashes and.
Just nice and it's later growls i love.
How this book turned out i feel.
Absolutely stunning but the point of.
This video is not this look it is the.
Concealer like i said it has only been.
One hour now but it still looks really.
Really bomb i did cover up my cheek.
Region obviously with freckles but you.
Can still tell under the eyes right here.
It still looks very very bright it isn't.
Actually creasing either which is really.
Really great my forehead looks fine and.
My moustache region looks fine and.
There's no creases everything looks.
Really really good and i'm honestly.
Extremely impressed i have to have out.
To see a few different rents right now.
But i'm gonna take you guys along with.
Me and we're going to do some check-ins.
Every few hours to see if this concealer.
Stays in place all night long.
Okay sisters we are doing a talk to.
Check in and what better person to do.
Otaki check in then so i'm wearing a new.
Product on my face right now i would.
Love for you to tell me what you think.
About my skin right now okay the.
Foundation looks really nice i like the.
Highlight i like the whole like brow.
Highlight inner corner moment you have.
Going on i dig that the freckle area did.
You make it darker yeah i did i put some.
Bronzer on and some blush on to like.
Okay to make it look like youthful like.
I was sunkissed but thinking more.
Specifically about like complex it's a.
Contested the kylie concealers of course.
This is like the hot product shocker.
I've seen better okay i don't know it.
Looks a little powdery were you ladies.
Loving it i honestly was i was a little.
Bit shocked because i didn't i didn't.
Think they're gonna be bad but i wasn't.
Expecting much and i was actually really.
Pleasantly surprised and looking at them.
Compared to what they look like an hour.
Ago i feel like they still look exactly.
The same just an hour mm-hmm your under.
Eyes don't look bad i think the thing.
That i'm noticing is the sunkist thing.
You did is throwing off a little bit of.
The brightness well i feel like i met i.
Felt like after i do that i was like oh.
Maybe not the best example for handle is.
It full coverage or just like it's light.
Coverage but i felt like when i put it.
On it was more medium coverage which i.
Definitely was not upset about and then.
I was able to layer actually really well.
So it is buildable for sure i mean i.
Want to show lack my face life rocks i.
Process are taught to the entire light.
Range of the concealers this is pretty.
Full coverage yeah i feel like this is.
This is actually really nice i agree i'm.
Not breaking the rules you never really.
Want to put concealer on top of powder.
But i'm just gonna see what happens i've.
Been wearing this makeup all day long.
That's actually the way to do it if you.
Really really need a touch-up with your.
Concealer like put it on the back of.
Your hand with a sponge and then you can.
Kind of just get the tiniest amount i've.
Never done that before but i'm horrified.
Really just kind of like touched up the.
Situation i like it i do too.
I was like and it's only 20 dollars to.
It which i feel like is honestly it's.
Way deeper than it's change it's not.
It's not 360 it's not i i think it's.
Good but obviously i need to keep.
Writing this if they're out tonight and.
I will keep you guys posted it's been.
Two hours now i think it still is going.
Up pretty strong under eyes may look a.
Little bit dry but that's just good i'll.
Keep you guys posted alright sister i.
Just got back home from it very very fun.
Night out with friends and it's.
Currently.
37 p.m. at night.
This means this makeup has been on for.
Just over eight hours now i definitely.
Am really ready to take this off and go.
To bed but let's do our final check-in.
And final thoughts so this is kelly i.
Face after eight hours of wearing with.
Absolutely no touch-ups i mean we can.
Tell it's getting a little bit crust to.
Get this point i'm definitely.
Getting some creases around this area.
I'm definitely looking a little bit oily.
As well but honestly i don't hate it you.
Guys know that i've honestly been loving.
It the more natural dewy skin rips loose.
On kind of living for this like lift and.
Makeup look but let's discuss the actual.
Concealer and like the under-eye region.
Looking in the mirror like i said my.
Face is a little bit do get oily right.
Now which i kind of like but if i touch.
Like right here or in the side of my.
Forehead it definitely feels a little.
Bit oily but if i touch underneath my.
Eyes it is literally bone-dry or like.
I'm talking sahara desert level you guys.
Saw that when i asked how do you a my.
Under eyes she did did if they looked a.
Little bit dry to me personally.
Obviously i see myself with makeup on.
Every single day i do not see that this.
Might be a little bit weird to say and.
Definitely may comment down below if you.
Think otherwise but i actually feel like.
My under eyes look a little bit better.
Than normal i feel like the brightness.
Is still very much there like you can.
Not see my under-eye bags.
Peeking through at all and i feel like.
The crease such level on them is a.
Little bit less than normal as well.
Aside from the aesthetic self on a.
Feeling level my under eyes do feel.
Ridiculously dry i feel like 20 dollars.
For the amount of product you're getting.
Is actually a really really fair price.
Especially in comparison to some of the.
Other high-end more popular concealers.
On the market right now on kylie's.
Instagram she said that this was a light.
Coverage but buildable concealer and i.
Would agree with her on that and.
Definitely went on a pretty light but i.
Was able to layer over top of it for a.
More full coverage and brightening.
Effect and i actually really really love.
How this looked on my under eyes and on.
The rest of my face today i will say.
Though that this formula is pretty.
Drying it looked absolutely beautiful on.
My skin before i said it with a lot of.
Powder but you guys know sister james.
Needs a whole lot of powder i do have a.
Combination to oily skin so i think that.
If you have my skin type this will be.
Really really perfect for you because.
It'll dry down a little bit and just.
Sent really beautifully into place but i.
Think that if you have dry skin this may.
Be a no-go because it might look a.
Little bit crusty and dusty just like my.
Under eyes were a little bit close to.
Getting today i think that the one major.
Flaw with us that may defer you from.
Getting to concealer as the fact that.
Kylie is an e-commerce brand.
I know kylie has been doing her little.
Kylie truck thing that like goes around.
All different stops in la and love.
People try out different products what.
You think is really really great.
Obviously she does not have any stores.
Where you can actually test the products.
And and what i find really really great.
About these concealers is that kylie.
Doesn't do returns so if you order a.
Shade it's a completely wrong shade.
You're stuck with it and you have 20.
On the train if this is a product that.
You want to check out i would definitely.
Recommend it doing your research.
Especially when it comes to your shade.
Range i would very much recommend.
Finding another beauty blogger or.
Influencer who has purchased that.
Concealers or receive them npr that has.
A similar skin tone to you and trying to.
Figure out what shade really works so.
You can make an educated decision just.
Our reference for those of you guys out.
There who are close to my skin tone my.
Two favorite foundations are my too.
Faced born this way in the shade a nude.
And eye makeup forever stick in the.
Shade why 315 and i usually like my.
Concealer to be one or two shades.
Lighter so in shape tape i'm in the.
Shade of light and therefore in the.
Kylie concealer i am in the shade gypsum.
Overall after testing out this concealer.
And my makeup routine and wearing it for.
Eight hours straight i think that kylie.
Has a winner on her hands.
Alright says it is literally getting so.
Late and i need to get my beauty rest.
Tonight i really hope you guys enjoyed.
