Hi sisters james charles here welcome.
Back to my youtube channel so today i.
Thought i would sit down and talk to you.
About saying that has been a very very.
Controversial and why did they talk.
About topic right now the makeup.
Community and just in like the community.
I guess in general and that is editing.
And retouching photos for some reason.
Lightly photoshopping and sitting has.
Been a very very controversial topic on.
Social media but having a little bit of.
A news flash for you guys almost every.
Single influence or celebrity that you.
See posting a photo has probably faced.
To again i don't know i recently people.
Have been getting so surprised and.
Called out for because this is much time.
In this moment since literally the.
Beginning of time everybody edits the.
Photos the i guarantee probably how.
About you watching a lot of bases itself.
On your photos well it's definitely one.
Of my all-time favorite used apps today.
I wanted to sit down with you guys and.
Show you the process trauma taking the.
Photo to actually posting other.
Instagram everything in between for some.
Reason a lot of people everything type.
All day and certain plugins out of my.
Assets and it all to make the pod which.
Is so proud of the truth often times if.
You guys we have the satellite post.
Completely block and none of the photos.
On there because unfortunately you can't.
Have that balance now i wish you could.
But yeah.
Really can't - this stuff i have never.
Once owned a hype enemy in the first.
Place i only talk about face sitting in.
Photoshop all the time and here i am.
Right now making their tutorial free.
Various than give away all my hints so.
That being said if you want to see how i.
Took my selfies from drab to fab just.
Make sure you keep on watching.
Alright everybody welcome to a home.
Screen this is my kind of one to seven.
Plus this is where i take all my photos.
 editing i used to use photoshop a.
Long time ago but now i keep it just on.
My phone it makes it a lot easier and a.
Lot quicker.
I go from start to finish now the first.
Time that i hope it is going to be.
Obviously snapchat hello - this is real.
This is me and the starkly public my.
Front camera now i never take actual.
Photos with my camera i always use.
Snapped up to take my selfies the camera.
On here is so good it doesn't appear.
Your images and it kind of like blurs up.
The skin and just puts a really soft.
Feel sort of everything making the.
Photos super super high quality but also.
Almost like self retouched if that makes.
Any sense once i take my photos i was.
Just save them and then i'll go through.
Of my favourites which are right up in.
Here and i think the ones i like the.
Best so for today's video i decided to.
Pieces to this photo right here that i.
Took this morning the same one that i.
Have on right now it is currently like.
This is 4 o'clock so it is now 5 hours.
Later.
Obviously warp down just a little bit.
But this is right after was fresh so.
This was taking writing from my window.
Out there in my apartment.
And ready to be editing this photo today.
For the grab and for the purposes of.
This video i do have talked about one.
Quick thing before i actually start.
Editing and that is how watching out of.
My photos as an artist i like to look at.
My instagram is kind of my portfolio so.
They don't want to put out the best work.
Possible for all of you guys to see when.
I do have my photos that always change.
Things that are already there you will.
Never ever see me actually editing on a.
Makeup that includes like editing on any.
Imperfections.
Smoothing out skin brightening up the.
Eyes and the highlights if it was lost.
Lighting and just stuff of that basic.
Nature.
Basic things that can't be fixed with.
Makeup that have to be fix with either.
Lighting or plastic surgery to things.
That are kind of out of my control.
That being said just in case anybody.
Wants to call me up for ally i did take.
A video this morning of this look and.
This is what i looked like this is once.
Again brought from snapchat on filter.
Unedited this is my makeup i looked.
Pretty decent i liked it a lot today and.
Yeah you can't edit this it's right over.
Santa so yeah i'm going to be editing.
This picture today just to enhance it a.
Little bit but keeping in mind what it.
Actually looks like this morning what.
You just saw in that minute know what.
I'm doing the first half that i always.
Happen to is facetune.
Now this happens the $4.99 in the app.
Store which is a lot more expensive than.
Other apps no this video.
Although and truly really immersive what.
Face - please we're gonna hit me up i'm.
Gonna try to make this icon up here go.
On to open photo then put a favorites.
And just pick this photo right here now.
Overall like i said before this is a.
Pretty good photo so i'm just gonna go.
In and really really lightly do some.
Retouching and the first two avenues is.
Rishi if you know a lot about angles you.
Can topple this photo was taken from.
Being low angle rather than a straight.
Hot angle or a very very high i usually.
Take photo shil this angle because it.
Allows for most of my eyelid space to be.
Shown because i have very very heavy.
Eyes boy in turn this makes my eyebrows.
Look too small are my lips look a little.
Bit smaller and my jawline to not be as.
Puppet and my forehead to look huge so.
These are just basic things that i like.
To retouch with this make sure they look.
As good and natural as possible first.
We're gonna do this photo a is i'm going.
To zoom in and i'm just going to make my.
Jawline super duper poppin unfortunately.
I cannot afford plastic surgery and i.
Also legally cannot get positive.
Surgeons longer age so this is the next.
Best thing that we got up in here i.
Really really like the way this looks.
Just because who doesn't love the really.
Good strong jawline i think it is one of.
The hottest features on a guy going out.
To the other side i'm not really going.
To do anything here just because my.
Jawline lines up with the corner out.
This wall and if i move it around it's.
Gonna look very very disordered and.
We're so not trying to get called out.
For editing today you want this to look.
As natural as possible believe it or not.
The next thing i'm gonna do is i'm gonna.
Go to the details tool this tool.
Basically adds contrast and sharpness to.
Photo wherever you draw on but i think.
This really does make such a difference.
I don't think the topic on my eyes it's.
Just an eyelash the straight to a.
Balloon when you stand out on the face.
Of it flirty and big same thing with the.
Inner brow hairs usually i'll do.
Anything else but because they're a.
Little bit prone out i'm not gonna bring.
Any more attention to them a little bit.
On the fake freckles just tell me and.
And then also on my cartier ring because.
They were tearing.
And people to know that it's there and.
That's pretty much all the decently i'm.
Gonna do i really don't wanna bring a.
Lot of other attended to the rest of the.
Faith so much i want to save it my.
Progress like i said getting before.
After that leaders that i'm not much but.
I think it really is just a little.
Things that make this little great in.
The end the next one i'm going to use is.
Going to lead the smooth tool and this.
Is one that really needs to be careful.
Because it truly kind of make a bring.
Your throws a lot of you can turn turn.
Out smoother and just scrub their photos.
Which i think looks absolutely awful is.
So big lurking and is obviously not.
Actual and people are going to know you.
Edited it it's definitely not a look i.
Actually tend to liberate never infuse.
Smoother like ways when you smooth and.
Just build up the opacity i really need.
To so when i go with this tool the first.
Thing i do is i'll go in and i'll just.
Floor with any pores for the most part.
Setting as actually having a pretty good.
It's game day so i'm just going to.
Lightly tap over areas that you touch.
Her which is kind of like in between the.
Brows on the nose region and then this.
Smile line that i always get right here.
I always just smooth it out i'm gonna.
Let me talk about my beard area as well.
Because i didn't shake city because i.
Was lazy and yeah to the shop in this.
Room to have when i really lightly go.
Over the lips i hate the way my lips.
Have a lot of texture and light they are.
Very very crusty i don't know why i'm.
Going to use every lip treatment on the.
Planet and for somebody's may still have.
Crusty and dusty especially when i'm.
Wearing cloth so i just moved about to.
Get a little more natural look as well.
I'd like to over line my lips with them.
A little bigger so i want them to look.
As real as possible now that i remember.
Smoothing i'm going to move my all-time.
Favorites tool and that is with tones.
This tool is like my hidden secret not a.
Lot of you will know how to use it but i.
Am a freaking queen of tones i love it.
Truly can make your photos so frickin.
Good if you use it correctly and.
So the first thing that i do on this.
Whole situation the highlights are very.
Very empowered now i was standing in.
Front of a very very large window.
Hitting after sunlight so you can see.
Most of the highlights is mr. company i.
Know is  very very bright but there's.
No way any of the sides my face or from.
Downwards because i hold the thumb.
Downwards so i'm just going to do a.
Little bit of tones to fix i'm i think.
Up and make sure all the highlights are.
Even and lighting so it's like the.
Caliph uthman actually gonna use a color.
That's already pre-selected and i'm just.
Gonna bring it up to the top i'm gonna.
Go almost to white but not quite i want.
To make sure it's not start player also.
Just literally fake and to like it just.
Doesn't look right.
Basically so just gonna pick this clip.
I'm gonna tell us that i'd like to do.
Right on in and i'm still starting by.
Tapping a little bit hotter than tip it.
Knows i'm also going to put a little bit.
More right up in here basically when i.
Do this i'm gonna go my phone like this.
So you can see but i like to really just.
Lightly tap on my phone.
I never was up there that's from bears.
Just gonna look really really stupid.
Like this which is obviously not the.
Look we're going for it looks extremely.
Wrong so i'm just gonna grab the eraser.
To erase over that but yeah they took.
Really just lightly tap it and just make.
Sure i'm getting it really really light.
And even effect and then if anything.
Looks too intense i don't really how.
That looks.
I'm just gonna down erased and just.
Lightly talked about already and there.
We go looks pretty good this has really.
Been some surveys out that so i never.
Had a little bit of highlight under the.
Cheekbone region now if you look right.
Here you can see what the texture is am.
Actual highlighter.
Now the link is not going to be from the.
Sides that need from a straight line and.
Because they were very very able to face.
The highlight is not reflecting.
I'm gonna lightly tell them a little bit.
Of highway right here just make sure to.
Shine with obviously that looks awful it.
Was going to type over elbows together.
Just kind of fun to animate the book as.
Much as possible.
And there we go that looks a little bit.
Better just a little bit with ivan just.
Let me know that it's there but it's.
Certainly not blindingly no.
But that is a okay now the next i'm.
Going to do in tone is the eyes and this.
Is saying that a lot of you will talk.
About they either love it or hate it.
I clearly love it because i continue to.
Do it and it's a trick that i absolutely.
Love and then it's brightening out with.
The eyes i'm gonna go back into tones.
And this time i'm just gonna go all the.
Way up to stark white all the way at the.
Inner corner i know if you are deities.
That i later can't now you can use your.
Light so i'm just gonna kinda i'm going.
To lightly golden tones i'm going to.
Zoom all the way in and i'm just gonna.
Start lightly tapping off of the way to.
Be high just to make them a little.
Bright and then when it comes to the.
Actual pupil this is my all-time.
Favorite trick i'm gonna let the top in.
The white on the peoples of the eye.
And this really brighten up and makes.
Them look so freakin pretty oh my god.
See how good that looks it just looks so.
Like dollar lightly almost a cartoon.
Character but it looks like it can.
Actually be natural which is why i.
Freaking love unfortunately my eyes are.
A round so i always wear my.
Contacts anyway they are desio in the.
Color creamy beige they're like all 10.
Viewers they are so freaking beautiful.
That they do look good with the.
Collection and flash why when it comes.
To like a photography it's really really.
Hard adjusting when you're wearing.
Really fluttery lashes because they.
Create shadows so i might just add a.
Little bit more brightness of the eyes.
That i do that by the choppers.
So i just tried a little bit of a v and.
I wasn't sure the the top part because i.
Don't wanna get rid of any little.
Shadows because i'm a little really big.
So it's gonna out of that white then go.
Back into the race and just make sure it.
Looks pretty good right as well the last.
And final step for this photo is going.
To be to work on it the nose contour now.
This is something that has sparked many.
The controversy in the past with my.
Followers people either love my nose.
Contour or hate my nose contour i.
Personally love a good snot nose like i.
Said before i am not someone who hides.
Kind of a very very open about her knee.
And might notice one of the most evident.
Davis i talked on my channel many times.
About my nose contouring how it's.
Something that i struggle with the.
Balance and i'm not very good at but i'm.
Learning and as you can see in this.
Photo it's honestly not that bad it does.
Look pretty stuff so we can if i can say.
For myself i do really count looks like.
I said i would post this but i want to.
Edit it to make it look even better.
Because why the hell not.
To do this i'm going to take the tone so.
I'm going to grab the paper tool and i'm.
Actually going to zoom in to it and she.
Cannot go around with the lightest shade.
Right up in here so i'm going to lightly.
Top it in that color all the time in the.
Nose i must get rid of the shadows i.
Also love this tool because when you do.
This it keeps the freckles on the.
Texture they are they've just changed.
The under color i'm not really sure how.
It works but it really truly does wonder.
So just why i absolutely love this trick.
Is like my secret to getting the.
All-time best to smash nose and there we.
Go that is the before and after of the.
Signature james charles dose match and.
It's by far the most interesting about.
Me but i'm not gonna hide it i have a.
Very very big secret i do really like.
The way this looks though on my photos.
My nose the thing that i was insecure.
About so if i didn't depend on it if you.
Know why i had a nose like this don't.
Do it it's really not that.
Serious.
This is just the techniques that i like.
To do and just to show you guys in this.
Box of how do you fake so now that the.
Nose is done this is my face basically.
Complete i don't know as you can see.
It's really not that different.
The pictures look pretty similar i just.
Made a little bit sharper a little.
Greater awareness lot cleaner but.
There's one more thing i like to do i'm.
A student when we go on the personal.
Photo if you wanted to be between this.
Out here everything we're gonna do from.
Now on for so the video is basically.
Just filter it and color stuff so this.
Photo could be coming done you could.
Post this item post is on my twitter or.
Something but for instagram because i.
Haven't.
Decent feet i'm going to whiten the.
Photo and display the colors a little.
Bit so the last thing i'm going to do my.
Facing that's going to it the white.
Until over here and this is the one step.
Where i will actually not remind us to.
Use your finger and go ham with it.
Scrubbing i really when i'm using this.
Tool i like to go absolutely ham just.
Right off the entire image because like.
I said we have a erase so this goal will.
Work in a second and zoom in and make.
Sure everything is very clean and for.
The most part i think we are done with.
Face daily total spending on the check.
Back save it save it to camera and there.
We are all set to move on with the next.
Step so for based in the next stop that.
I rather to use this vsco cam now music.
Filters to self assembly for you.
I personally don't like filters how they.
Should fit the raw image and then just.
Play with the colors a little bit so i'm.
Just gonna use notes okay for that i'm.
Not gonna have a filter which didn't.
Start the little thing in the bottom.
Corner like this body then i'm gonna go.
Over to this tool right here which is.
Called skin tone i personally hate but i.
Look either to yellow or too big in.
Photos it is one of my biggest pet.
Peeves i don't know why i like to look.
As neutral as possible and in this.
Little faint looking way too yellow.
So take this fight i'm gonna drag it.
Down probably to around around like 3.5.
Looks nice in neutral.
I'm not really sure how this is gonna.
Read on the actual video recording above.
My phone this is looking for a very.
Neutral very very late right in the.
Middle of pink and yellow so i'm just.
Gonna go ahead and sing that up right.
There.
For some reason this really bothered me.
I always.
This but i hate when my skin tone does.
Not look the same across all my pictures.
So this is one set there's absolutely.
Vital to our process now the only other.
Thing is that makes your hand vscocam.
Basically the boat is done so now i'm.
Gonna open up the hips you're not gonna.
Get ready to post so it's gonna.
Obviously open up i can't go to this.
Photo that i'm just going to adjust it.
To however to be i like doing the.
Brightness way up so i'm hoping that to.
Around 7 the contrast i'll boost as well.
As probably around some of the guys walk.
The way straight way down reservists i.
Really like the look of cool toma photos.
So i usually bring my work down to.
Around 15 or 18 i guess whatever not.
That serious and all over the saturation.
Top as well because sometimes the ones.
Can really build out the photos that i.
Wanna make sure the vibrancy is still.
There it just looks more cool toned the.
Next thing i do is go into this column.
Tab and like i said how they're going to.
Look really cool tone so i'm just going.
To pick shadows go over to the blue and.
Then bring this down to probably around.
15% i'm going to highlight that for this.
Photo i'm going to boost him up a little.
Bit happy turn around 10 and i was like.
To play my shadows down just got a.
Little bit more contrast and my last and.
Final step is just to shorten the photo.
This is like the one thing that i love.
To do and sometimes when you take snap.
Selfies like i said it makes the quality.
Super super good and super smooth but we.
Sometimes do looks a little bit of that.
Detail and sharpness so i really just.
Run with the crap any pictures for this.
One i'm only gonna set of the round help.
Me around with 30 just to be safe and.
That is the completed photo with that i.
Would go next write whatever caption a.
Lot and then click share all right guys.
And now stick pleated face tube tutorial.
Just for overall reference we went from.
This to this like i said before i do.
Consider myself an artist and for me and.
My instagram was like my portfolio so.
I'd like to put out the best quality.
Photos as possible and that definitely.
Includes editing almost every single.
Photo posted by inputs or an online.
Celebrity has been edited and that's.
Just the cold hard truth it's something.
To be embarrassed huh and tussling to.
Call people help for in a something to.
Yell either for the most of us it's just.
To fix them imperfections but obviously.
