Today's youtube video this was quite the.
Wild ride but thank you mom for walking.
Me through your beauty routine and.
Regardless of how copy these products.
Are used to look beautiful on a daily.
Basis so that's all that matters i guess.
Thank you i think every time i do these.
Videos people love to comment and say oh.
My god james you're so ignorant so rude.
Not everybody used to put on as much.
Makeup as you do and i'm like no i do.
Know that but i do makeup now for a.
Living.
And i didn't grow up wearing makeup so.
That's why having to do that style of.
Makeup using your fingers and using old.
Products is always a shock factor to me.
Because it's not something that i'm used.
To our styles are very different and the.
Amount of makeup that we use is very.
Different but i am excited to learn the.
New techniques that you have taught me.
Over the last couple years when you.
Became an emmy way yeah speaking of next.
