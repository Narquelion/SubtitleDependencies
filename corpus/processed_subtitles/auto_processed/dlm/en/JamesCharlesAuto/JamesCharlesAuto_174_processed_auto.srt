Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel so.
Music.
This past weekend here in los angeles.
Was the annual pride parade i am so.
Honored and proud to be part of the.
Lgbtq community it is such an amazing.
Place to be but unfortunately i did not.
Get to actually go to the parade as you.
Guys know i did just moved to los.
Angeles and i was so looking forward to.
Going to the first-ever pride event.
I have never actually been to one before.
So i was so pumped toward like some glam.
Makeup and meet a ton of you guys but i.
Had something a little bit more.
Important to do that weekend i was.
Actually shooting a very very exciting.
Campaign commercial that i cannot talk.
To you guys about just yet.
But i promise you'll be finding out very.
Very soon but being said however it was.
And prior to baste commercial and i was.
Wearing this look for the shooting i.
Posted on instagram and snapchat so many.
Of you guys aren't crazy over this.
Rainbow cut crease prime and spine look.
I have to miss makeup a total of five.
Times out and after number four on the.
Set for the commercial i literally.
Tweeted saying i would never ever ever.
To a rainbow cut crease ever again but.
So many of you guys asked for tutorial.
On this and it was something that was.
Very very hard to explain this is.
Definitely a very very intricate look so.
I figured let me just suck it up put it.
Back on for the fifth and final time and.
Film a freaking tutorial.
That being said that this look is.
Definitely not the easiest thing in the.
World it's definitely pretty tricky and.
Extravagant so i definitely just go into.
James tutorial mode and teach you guys.
These little techniques and tricks that.
I use to get this look so if you want to.
See how i created this rainbow pride cut.
Crease make sure you keep on watching.
All right babes so i'm starting off with.
My face and eyebrows already completely.
On and done this look is very very.
Focused on the eye region obviously so i.
Don't want to take too long on the base.
I just use my makeup primer ultra hd.
Stick and then my turn shape tape as.
Always my laura mercier and then my.
Benefit brow products so just a normal.
Routine like always every single video.
And now let's just go ahead and move.
Right on with the eyes and get into the.
Glam i already went ahead and pat my.
Eyelids using some concealer and then.
Some loose powder and the first part i'm.
Gonna go often is my morphe 35n palette.
Of course any ways that you can use code.
Jase or 10% off your.
Yes this problem is my all-time favorite.
Develop that i used to my colorful looks.
As you can see it is very very used and.
Damaged but as my holder krill that i'm.
Gonna start with this angle brush i'll.
Just dip into the yellow shade down in.
The bottom to start sketching out my.
Crease so you guys know my cut crease i.
Do do that a little bit of a strange way.
And that as i sketch out of the crease.
First and then gotten with the shadows.
And went upward after this is not a very.
Very common technique but it's what.
Works best for me so follow it don't.
Follow it that's on you to decide sister.
Youtube you this is just my eyelid.
Crease i wonder if this works really.
Really well for me just because it gives.
Me a really really good guideline when.
It comes to the concealer i can just.
Super easily cut it right in half and i.
Don't have to really worry about like.
Shaping or anything like that i don't.
Know this is my personal favorite and.
Then i'm going to use the same exact.
Brush and i'm gonna dip into the orange.
Shade and kind of place that in the.
Middle of the cut crease and then with.
That same exact brush dipping right into.
The red and then finally winging that.
Out using the bright pink shade when i.
Sketch out my cut crease as you can see.
I do got a little bit of hooded eye it's.
When i look shape for it at the camera.
There's not much actual lid space you.
Can see so when i draw my crease in i.
Really like to go above my natural.
Crease or what i look for it you can.
Still see pretty much all the cut crease.
This just once again my style you don't.
Have to do this i know a lot of people.
Like to put their concrete in their.
Actual crate you spin that into say cut.
Crease you get what i'm saying.
Put your diffic a star ever you want it.
Personally i've heard a draw above the.
Crease and i feel like this gives a deep.
Best result but once again you do you.
Next i'm gonna go away i'm four three.
Three brush and dip right back into that.
Yellow shade and i'm just gonna really.
Focus this clear right on the inner.
Corner of that crease area that's great.
My morphe amma one five one brush.
Dipping into my anasazi a-blazing single.
Shadow i'm going to use this color and.
I'm going to keep it up the orange part.
Of the crease i'm just going right in.
Where i drew that original crease line.
And darkening up the bottom a portion of.
Not creed's just to create a little bit.
More dimension and then carving another.
33 brush i'm gonna dip into the.
Bright orange a to the 35b palette and.
Blend that out next we're gonna have a.
Clean a morphe m151 brush again and dip.
Into my jeffree star and drogyny palette.
And the shade fetish same thing with the.
Orange i'm just placing this cloth at.
The bottom of that crease line from.
Before just to create some dimension.
Bang carving another m33 burps i'm going.
To dip into that red shake from the 35b.
Palette and i'm going to blend that out.
Music.
And then finally with one less i'm four.
Three three i'm going to dip into the.
Bright pink shade and just blend out the.
Outside of that line and smoke it out.
And those are all the colors are already.
On there like i told you guys the.
Segment yes super easy and definitely my.
Favorite i've been doing it since.
Beginning if you have not tried this.
Technique to do a concrete definitely a.
Ton of ted water go ahead just try it.
Let me know what you think at least i.
Promise you will not regret it.
But that being said as you can see.
There's already a super easy guide.
Already drawn out because we sketch it.
Out originally but now just to clean it.
Up i'm gonna go back and buy a.
Heart-shaped cape concealer em i have a.
Makeup shock t-80 sticks brush and i'm.
Just going to clean up that line i'm.
Just going to slowly trace right.
Underneath that crease line being really.
Careful not to mess it up because that.
Blending is already looking a bomb.
Oh yeah i think we don't have to go.
Around and we do it so i'm just tracing.
The bottom of that line and driving it.
Right into the inner corner and then.
With a new job uh concealer and down.
Onto the eyelid just set that concealer.
At replacing just to brighten up the.
Island itself and get ready for it the.
Liner i'm just gonna use the makeup shot.
T6 brush in the white shade in the 35b.
And just packing it right on there.
For awaiting today i can use my kat von.
D tattoo and locket lila this is my.
All-time favorite winged liner.
Now looking at this this wing is.
Definitely way bigger than normal but.
Keep in mind it is a very very large cut.
Crease almost like drag style makeup.
Look so we definitely want to try to.
Balance it out at least a little bit.
When it comes to the atlanta because.
This would look very very shake there's.
A huge boat on crease and then a tiny.
Little baby baby wings so once again a.
Theme of this video do what you want but.
This stuff to the style that i feel like.
Well the best for this look and just.
What i came up with.
Honestly this wing is ready to cut a.
I am living for it let's go ahead.
And move on for my bottom lash i have.
Today i'm first gonna start off by.
Letting my waterline using the mac.
Fascinating.i kohl pencil.
I love the formula it is so creamy and.
Smooth and doesn't irritate my eyes you.
Guys know that i'm really really not a.
Fan of honestly been kind of skip me on.
That stuff recently but this firmware is.
One that doesn't irritate me and for.
This look at that really looks super.
Cute to have a little bit of white in.
The inner corner just to open up the.
Eyes make them look a little bit bigger.
A little more for the little pump.
Because we are to be gluing some.
Swarovski crystals in there too so i'm.
Just gonna use this to really brighten.
Up that lower lash line and get ready.
For a whole lot of color for the first.
Color on my waterline i'm gonna grab you.
Guessed it the morphe 35n white m33.
Brush and i'm just gonna dip into this.
Sky blue shade up in the top right.
Corner i'm just focusing this color.
Right on the center of the lower lash.
Line and blending it lightly out to the.
Left and the right i definitely didn't.
Want to take the shadow too low down or.
Else it's gonna really accentuate those.
Eye bags but i am being careful just to.
Make sure it is still blown out because.
We don't want a superduper harsh line.
That is boys against the rules when it.
Comes to makeup with sister j nexen i go.
Back in with a 35 b and my sigma e55.
Eyes shading brush this is just a a flat.
Definer brush that i'm just gonna dip.
Into this bright green shade right up in.
Here and i'm just gonna place this in.
The inner corner or right underneath.
That white shadow.
Out of all the colors in the rainbow.
Green is probably my least favorite.
Color so like i was saying personal.
Preference i'm gonna probably use the.
Least amount of green shadow and best.
Luck and i'm just gonna really focus.
This right on the inner corner and.
There's gonna hot pocket of my blue.
Blending brush and make sure that those.
Shades are very well blended together.
For the last clone i'm gonna grab miami.
5 6 - a tiny tapered blending brush and.
Dip right into this with right ass.
Purple to finish off the lower lash line.
I'm just taking this purple shade and.
I'm putting it right in the outer corner.
On the outer third of the lid pulling.
Into the blue a little bit and then just.
Pulling it up and out and blending it.
Into the bottom of that wing then to.
Finish off the eye look i'm gonna grab a.
Uh swarovski crystal and the size 14 and.
Just pop her right on to deny that are.
You just stopped my last sentence.
Midweek i apologize i just popped on a.
Swarovski crystal on the size number 14.
Using a tiny dollop of flash fill in the.
Inner corner hmm i'm so sorry about that.
Now we're gonna move on with the lashes.
And for today i'm using the house lash.
Psychotics as always i always love these.
For crazy so i'm just going to glue her.
Right on then to finish off this eye.
Look i'm just gonna use my benefit.
Roller lash mascara you guys know this.
Is my all-time babe just to blend.
Together my fake lashes with my aren't.
Real ones.
Alright guys that is one prayin rainbow.
Cut crease i all complete i'm gonna.
Gonna do the one off-camera now just.
Save some time and i'll be right back.
Okay finish off the rest of the face all.
Right we'll be right along for blush.
That i'm gonna use the mac dolly mix.
Blush with my morphe okay this has no.
Name on it so this brush i am packing.
The blush a little bit heavier than.
Normal today for james krause i like oh.
This is definitely not my usual luck but.
I'm using a pink highlighter today and.
For the commercial that i shot this for.
They really wanted a very very intense.
Private that would show well my camera.
So this is just exactly what i did once.
Again if you don't want to wear that.
Much blush you do use this terms this is.
Getting so annoying i apologize and.
Therefore highlighters today i'm going.
To use the eclipse highlighter from a.
Jeffrey's are in collaboration with.
Mandy mua i freaking love this thing it.
Is so blinding pull and i'm just gonna.
Lay out right over top of that blush so.
It gives a little bit of a pink.
Iridescent glow i'm also poppin is how.
Later right onto the brow bone for a.
Little bit more glow up there then i'm.
33 angle right over.
That line between the two just make sure.
That however is not too defined we're.
Just saying that i never thought i would.
Send my tan line but we just want to.
Settle down that glow just the slightest.
Bit to make sure they're evenly blended.
Between the highlight the brow and like.
The red crease to finish this look off.
My lips today i'm gonna use the over.
Liquid lipstick in the shade at pasadena.
I felt like a nude lip was it definitely.
Necessary for this look just being that.
If i'd chose any a bright color it would.
Probably a really really unbalanced the.
Eye look i didn't want to like a red or.
Anything because then there'd be too.
Much red or like a blue you get what i.
Mean i feel like they need to be the.
Perfect happy medium between all three.
And pasadena so my all-time faves and.
You guys know you can use code james i'm.
Sorry 2% off all over up products as.
Well.
All right and to finish this look off.
Once and for all i'm gonna drench myself.
In the urban decay all nighter setting.
Spray if you're gonna be wearing this.
Look to a prime event is gonna be very.
Very hot probably very very sweaty and.
Probably very brief item celebratory so.
You definitely gonna make sure you lock.
In your makeup all day long.
Alright guys and that is the completed.
