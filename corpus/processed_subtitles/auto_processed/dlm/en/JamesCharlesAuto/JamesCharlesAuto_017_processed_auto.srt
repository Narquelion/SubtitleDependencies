Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel first.
Today's that i have something super.
Super fun plan that i'm actually very.
Excited to do i don't know if a lot of.
You guys know this but before i actually.
Was the beauty guru it was doing makeup.
On myself as a full-time job i actually.
Was doing makeup on a bunch of my.
Friends from school.
Back home in my little salon and my.
Basement made by my dad and i really.
Really missed doing client work so so.
Much and for me i'm planning to do my.
Own makeup all the time i really don't.
Get the feeling or pleasure of being on.
The other end of the brush getting my.
Glam done and getting to enjoy the work.
Of other artists i definitely have a.
Very distinct style of makeup that i.
Always do it myself i plan a shadows a.
Certain way i contour my face a certain.
Way i face to the certain way as well.
And i was definitely bringing something.
About different ways that i can get.
Gland by other people and i came to the.
Conclusion that the perfect way to do it.
Will be to get some awesome.
Transformations so i booked a play with.
That the three most popular spots that.
People go to get their makeup done for.
Different events being mac sephora and.
Ulta and i went and i got my makeup done.
At all three and i'm gonna show you guys.
Default transformation i wanted to make.
This into a little bit of a challenge or.
A miniseries so this is gonna be the.
First video like i said of a bunch of.
Different transformation videos for each.
Different transformation i'm gonna give.
Each artist the same exact photo i.
Picked out this one of jacqueline hale i.
Figured this like warm tone bronzy.
Smokey eye is the perfect look for this.
Upcoming fall if features like smoked.
Out shadow which is definitely not the.
Easiest technique in the world gold.
Glitter as well as a lot of highlighter.
Definite full coverage skin as well as a.
Dark vampy lip i think that this look is.
A really great challenge for us because.
It's definitely not the easiest thing in.
The world but it's definitely not too.
Hard as well i'm gonna give the same.
Exact picture to each artist and they're.
Gonna do their best job to recreate it.
On me using the products sold at that.
Particular store and after each.
Registration we're gonna come right back.
Here and i'm gonna show you guys the.
Finished look obviously then we're gonna.
Talk about my experience as a whole how.
The actual look turned out how close the.
Look was to the original photo and.
Finally what i recommend you to go there.
To get your makeup done like i said for.
Today's the first makeover i booked an.
Appointment at sephora and hollywood so.
Let's head over there right now but.
Before this video starts make sure to go.
Give it a big thumbs up down below if.
You're excited alright guys without.
Further ado let's hop in an uber and get.
Over to sephora.
Music.
So immediately walking into somewhere i.
Was created - sales associate which was.
Really really awesome and she asked me.
If i needed anything i told her i was.
There to get my glam makeover done that.
I was scheduled under a different name.
For three o'clock and of course she knew.
Who i was instantly which kind of blew.
My cover which i was definitely a little.
Bit annoyed about i wanted to do this.
Definitely on the dl and incognito but.
So many of you sisters kept coming up to.
Me asking for photos as well which i was.
So fine then because i love meeting you.
Guys anyway you guys blew my cover but.
It's okay just as the little point.
Before i get started i think that the.
Workers knowing who i am definitely may.
Have made my experience a little bit.
Better than the average customer.
Obviously i cannot speak for every step.
For an employer every sephora store.
Because everyone's gonna have a.
Different experience but and my.
Particular visit they were super super.
Kind and accommodating and my actual.
Artist didn't know who i was so that was.
Great she treated me as a normal.
Everyday customer which is amazing but.
That being said at the average sephora.
Makeover is 45 minutes and i was there.
For almost two hours so like i said.
Definitely pobably got a little bit of a.
Better treatment i can't speak for.
Everybody but my experience overall it.
Was good to get started on my makeover.
The absolute first thing i did was show.
My artist a picture of the look that i.
Wanted being that jacqueline hale smokey.
Eye and she said okay great let's do it.
So that was awesome she was not.
Intimidated to is not scared she didn't.
Try to talk me into something else which.
Was amazing because i know a lot of.
Times hardest do try to do that to do.
Something easier i was like girl we're.
Doing this look and she was like okay.
Sister i got you the first thing that.
She did was asked me for my skin type.
And i told her that it was combination.
And she pulled a bunch of different skin.
Care products to prep me for my makeup.
And then as well she pulled out the.
Sephora iq color tester this is.
Basically a little machine that takes.
Tiny pictures of different areas of your.
Skin which then it matches you to your.
Foundation and difference to four.
Foundations that they sell in store.
Which i thought was so so cool i think.
My color iq thing was like - 7 qy or.
Something i don't remember off the top.
Of my head but my foundation was.
Definitely a pretty close match to what.
My normal foundation would be so after.
My skin was all prepped with a bunch of.
Different skin care products the first.
Is the artist reynolds eyelid primer to.
Start off the eyeshadow base and for.
Ashley doe today she used the sephora.
Pro palette which i think was the warm.
Palette and then a little bit of the.
Anasazi of blonde renaissance palette.
For more touches of red and pink even.
Though my eyes were closed and i was not.
Turned towards the mirror i obviously.
Could feel what was going on and i did.
Notice and really appreciate that she.
Definitely spent a lot of time blending.
She kept going back into the bunch a.
Different blending brushes making sure.
That all of her lines are really.
Seamlessly.
But it out which i definitely appreciate.
As an artist obviously you guys know it.
Is super super important to always blend.
Your eyeshadows always go on those.
Circular windshield wiper motions make.
Sure there are no harsh lines and i.
Definitely think she did a good job of.
Achieving pot it's actually giving the.
Eyeshadow look that i gave her to do.
Next the artist went in and did my brows.
Using the anasazi eyebrow definer and.
Then set all the hairs in place using.
The benefit cosmetics 24-hour brow.
Center once the bronze were all slayed.
And in place her next step is going to.
Be deep base and for today's foundation.
She's the bare minerals performance.
We're at liquid foundation now as you.
Guys know my holy grail of the make up.
For ever ultra hd stick to face born.
This way and recently the giorgio armani.
Luminous silk all of which are sold at.
Sephora and bare minerals was definitely.
Not to be the first brand that i would.
Run to when it comes to foundation but i.
Do not say anything i was super super.
Careful to keep my opinions to myself.
The entire time i did not look at myself.
Either i wanted a full reveal at the end.
And it to be the full artist work next.
For concealers she went in with the nars.
Radiant creamy concealer in the shade.
Vanilla i believe and as you guys know a.
Shave team is now sold at sephora so i.
Think the nars radiant creamy was.
Definitely a really really great option.
To use on me and is definitely one of my.
All-time favorite concealers as well.
Then she set my face in place using the.
Laura mercier translucent setting powder.
Which is my all-time favorite i was.
Definitely really really glad about this.
Because y'all know flash shock is my.
Middle name so i definitely did not want.
To have a powder that i do not like and.
I was very very happy to see her using.
This one on me and i think it worked i.
Was normal perfectly fine next step she.
Went in and bronze my face using a big.
Fluffy brush was obviously i have love.
And she ended the hourglass of bronzer.
Which i was simply a little bit.
Surprised about being that benefit hoola.
Bronzer is the number one best-selling.
Bronzer in sephora i believe don't quote.
Me on that but i think regardless it's.
My number one favorite so i was.
Definitely little bit disappointed to.
See her not using that the hourglass was.
Definitely an interesting choice they.
Actually did not even know they even had.
Bronzers i just know about their hominis.
Which are really really bomb so once.
Again do not say anything just let her.
Do her thing then she ran in with the.
Highlight and at this point i definitely.
Could tell she was a fan of beauty gurus.
Because after i showed her the picture.
Of jacqueline pele in the beginning for.
Highlander she pulled out this champagne.
Pop which is jacqueline's collaboration.
With becca cosmetics i was super excited.
To see this one being used on me it is.
Definitely my all-time favorite.
Highlighter shades it is beautiful and.
Golden and she prob about using a pretty.
Big brush which i was a little bit.
Spooked about but once again it didn't.
Get to see until the very very end after.
I was glowing for the goods she actually.
Went back into the eyes to finish.
The mascara and lashes and for the.
Mascaras to use the marc jacobs mascara.
Which i was very excited off because.
I've never tried it and she actually did.
Something with the wand that i was super.
Super intrigued by she took the top of.
The mascara wand and bend it at a 90.
Degree angle and used that to do my.
Lashes instead of like the typical.
Completely horizontal wand i thought it.
Was a really really cool technique and.
Definitely made it really really easy.
For her to do eyelashes this is.
Definitely saying that i'll be trying.
With all eye mascara wands from now on i.
Definitely learned that as a really cool.
Trick and i can't wait to try it out for.
Myself for the lashes tv one on a pair.
Of sephora lashes i forgot to catch the.
Name for them but they're really really.
Pretty and they're more winged out on.
The outer corners just like in the.
Picture that jacqueline had finally to.
Finish off the look she's the kat von d.
Vampira liquid lipstick which is.
Actually the first ever liquid lipstick.
I ever purchased with my own money when.
I first started to do makeup so it.
Definitely has a very very special place.
In my heart she did pick it herself but.
I thought it was the absolute perfect.
Shade too back to the picture of.
Jacqueline so i was definitely really.
Happy when she walked over with it and.
She just put it on my lips.
All right guys so now i am back home and.
This is the finished look all complete.
Justice a little heads-up to you guys i.
Didn't have the entire portion of this.
Video filmed as soon as i got home with.
The full makeup on and i film the outro.
With the makeup on as well it was super.
Super cute and then of course i went to.
Edit it and the audio was completely.
Wonky and broken my microphone had.
Actually died so i had to go get a new.
End which was very very annoying but the.
Make cover was obviously complete and i.
Already filmed the entire thing and i.
Definitely did not want to lose this.
Video because i was super excited to do.
The rest of the series so i am sitting.
Back down after the fact i obviously do.
Not have the makeup on anymore.
But i am referencing the pictures from.
Earlier on and i'm still gonna talk.
About how i felt.
So obviously the audio is not gonna.
Match up with what's going on in the.
Video but just please sort of pay.
Attention to what i am saying and just.
Use the video as like a reference point.
To what i'm really talking about before.
We get into the actual makeup my first.
Want to talk about my experience at this.
Particular sephora and like i said.
Beforehand it was really really good now.
Obviously i cannot speak for every.
Sephora employee or store and i.
Definitely do have a name in the makeup.
World so the treatment may have been a.
Little bit biased but i've also been.
Very very poorly treated and a lot of.
Supports that i've been to as well.
So i do think this particular support.
Did a really really great job of.
Customer service like i said when i.
Walked and they were very very helpful.
They wanted to get me help as soon as.
Possible to give me what i needed and.
They stopped me right down for my.
Appointment my girl was on time and she.
Was ready to slay my face all that being.
Said a sephora makeover it's supposed to.
Take only 45 minutes and mine did take.
Almost up to 2 hours but there was not.
Many other people in the store getting.
Their makeup done so that might be a.
Reason why and also i'm sure that the.
Artist was making sure that she did a.
Really really great job which i very.
Much appreciated let's go ahead and pull.
A mirror and super super close and.
Actually talk about the makeup so let's.
Go in with the same order that she.
Applied and starting off with the eyes.
I think after looking at everything the.
Eyes are probably my favorite part of.
This entire look like i said beforehand.
She definitely spend a lot of time on.
The eyeshadow probably the most time out.
Of anything in this makeup book and she.
Kept going back into the different.
Blending brushes to make sure that.
Everything was seamlessly blended.
Together which i'm very much appreciated.
And i think that the shadow is pretty.
Accurate to the original picture that.
Jacqueline hale posted also the liner is.
Applying a very very evenly the line is.
Nice and straight and even throughout.
Which i love there's nothing worse than.
A wonky liner and the lashes are glued.
On very very comfortably i cannot figure.
Them which is the best if there's one.
Thing that i would change about this.
Look if i was doing it on myself i wish.
He would have used a different shade of.
Gold for the actual lid.
I feel like the shade that jackal news.
On her original picture was a lot more.
Glittery and much more shade painting.
Toned whereas this gold shadow was.
Definitely little bit more yellow and.
More a satin shade i wish you would have.
Used one like this tea light liquid.
Metals like you guys know i love or an.
Actual gold glitter on top but she did.
Just use the palette and i think it.
Still turned out equally as beautiful.
The next stop being the brows i actually.
Really liked the way she did them they.
Looked nice and light and fluffy which i.
Love a good feather brow moment i like.
The color she used in the anasazi abroad.
To find her if anything i wish you would.
Have defined the brow tail a little bit.
More but i'm definitely not mad at them.
The next that was obviously going to be.
The base which was the foundation and.
Like i said the bare minerals foundation.
Would definitely not be my first choice.
When it comes to a sephora foundation.
Picking but like i said it wasn't gonna.
Say anything after looking at it in the.
Mirror i don't think it's that bad i.
Think that she definitely did a really.
Really great job of using the foundation.
To its fullest potential.
She did a really great job making sure.
That it was even all throughout my skin.
I definitely don't see any patchiness or.
Anything but i will say that it.
Definitely is creating a little bit.
Especially around my smile lines like.
Foundations normally do but this one is.
Pretty bad and as well it's definitely.
Not the most flattering on my pores i.
Don't think she did a bad job but i.
Definitely would not be choosing this.
Foundation again next is the concealer.
And like i said we use the nars radiant.
Creamy concealer and this is one of my.
All-time favorites i have no complaining.
To this i really liked how it made my.
Under eyes look and feel.
Next was bronzing and contouring and i.
Think that this is probably my least.
Favorite part of this look like i said.
She use the hourglass bronzer and i feel.
That this bronzer is just a little bit.
Too orange for my skin tone in the.
Picture that jacqueline posted she.
Definitely doesn't have actually too.
Much of a defined contour going on it's.
Definitely a lot softer and i felt as.
Though the bronze and contour today was.
Definitely really really pigmented what.
I normally do love but it didn't really.
Match that one with the photo and i felt.
As though the bronzer she uses a little.
Bit to oranjee tones i wish it was.
Definitely a little bit more cool to him.
To kind of sculpt the face rather than.
Just bronze and as well she did not.
Contour i know it's which i was really.
Really spooked about once i looked in.
The mirror you guys know that my nose is.
Probably my biggest insecurity and i.
Really love to make it nice and snatched.
So to see no contour on it was.
Definitely a little bit spooky i should.
The highlight major props of this artist.
For knowing different people in the.
Makeup industry and knowing about beauty.
Influence or collapse i thought it was.
So clever when she pulled out champagne.
Pop after showing a picture with.
Chocolate and like i said it is a.
Beautiful highlighter shade but how.
There is applied in all the right places.
Being the brow bone the inner corner of.
The tip of the.
And on the cheekbones but it's.
Definitely a little bit of a subtle glow.
There's absolutely nothing wrong with.
That and it is definitely a really.
Really beautiful look on my skintone but.
I do wish she would have applied a.
Little bit more with ash's personal.
Preference laughs it finally not least.
We finished off the look with the.
Ellipse and like i said we used the kat.
Von d liquid lipstick in the shade.
Vampira after the actual shape of the.
Lips i think she did a really really.
Good job.
My lips are actually uneven and one side.
Is a little bit bigger so i thought she.
Did a really really great job of making.
Sure that the two sides were even and.
The lines were very very defined which i.
Love i cannot stand a blurry and messy.
Lip line even though the actual shape.
Was great the one thing i did notice.
About the lips is that the product was a.
Little bit streaky.
I really wished it would have applied a.
Little bit more product to make the.
Color a lot more even on throughout but.
It really was not that big of a deal.
Overall i think i would rate this.
Makeover a 7 out of 10 my experience was.
Really really great and all the.
Employees were so beyond nice to me and.
My artist was really really careful to.
Make sure that i got exactly what i.
Wanted she took a lot of time blending.
Everything and making sure that.
Everything was really really perfect.
Which i really really appreciate it it's.
Super important you have an artist that.
Really cares about you and your vision.
As a client and isn't just gonna get it.
Done just to get it done and to get that.
Paycheck so major respect to her overall.
I really liked a lot of different things.
That she did with my makeups today and.
Definitely picked up on a few new.
Techniques that i definitely try.
Obviously there are a few things that i.
Would have changed if i were doing it.
Myself but every artist has her.
Particular way of doing things and i.
Don't think that the cons outweigh the.
Pros in this situation and i would feel.
Confident enough to wear this makeup out.
And not like second-guess myself.
All right guys that is all i have for.
This videos today definitely make a.
