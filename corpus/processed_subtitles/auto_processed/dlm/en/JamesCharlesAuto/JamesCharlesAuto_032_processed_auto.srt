Determined when it comes to a.
Competition awesome what's that finally.
Gathered how many kids do you want i.
Want just one more boy i'm done okay so.
The brother is me.
Not literally to sister out louisville.
Area she's obsessed with her really he's.
Actually too obsessed with her it's.
Almost scary i feel like we give her so.
Much love that she just knows she's.
She's good does have a reason to be.
Jealous i was not excited my mom told me.
We were having another one in the family.
Accessories i decided as i need to be an.
Only child did you just take this.
Foundation i'm not sure we're sharing.
Cousin how is it adjusting to like not.
Paint pregnant anymore.
Honestly yes just cuz i was so over it.
Really um i don't know how to act though.
Like i forget that sometimes like i.
Don't have a baby in my belly and i like.
Grab my belly yeah but it's okay because.
I'm like at that awkward stage right now.
Where i don't close right where i'm not.
Pregnant but i look like i may be.
Pregnant still sound like it's okay like.
People don't know oh my god damn i'm.
Good.
Don't look at it hard yet okay just i'm.
Not i'm a shot being fix i can always.
Pay sighs yeah a little beauty mark in.
The middle of your chin.
I have beauty marks all over my face.
Yeah but you guys don't don't we trying.
To get along we're best friends now you.
Can no you relax.
So i've been just having you guys for.
Literally over a year now and i it's.
Gonna be really embarrassing.
I just realized probably about roughly.
Two weeks ago that a family was like.
Boston kathryn my mouth oh my gosh.
Really.
So what do you think iowa i generally.
Don't know no i didn't think that you.
Thought that we just picked that like.
Who's and then it all hit me nothing oh.
Wow.
Will you be changing the name no the.
Sister-like is here no so that was like.
A question but acfm oh no no no.
So we were thinking of names.
With either a c or an 8 because we.
Didn't want to change the name yeah if.
We round exactly campus our names are.
Used a three way yeah so we thought of a.
So the aim just goes in with my a and.
Yeah is the same okay what if we have a.
Boy hmm it could potentially change like.
Really change this time that's all i can.
Really say because we already had the.
Names picked out before ace was even.
Nothing we love a branded family.
Honestly you know i think i would read.
In family because i just think this is.
So cool awesome even they're talking to.
You today when we were shopping earlier.
You were very into like obviously.
Contact pictures but also the business.
Side which hello i love the most you.
Guys joined youtube how many two years.
Ago yes and you're now at 13 million.
Correct love that for you that's good.
And fun and fresh thanks same for me i.
Just joined two years ago when i'm about.
To have ten kind of i'm not for us.
So fun how was your guys's life's.
Changed drastically and a lot of good.
Ways and a lot of.
Not-so-good ways but it's changed for.
The better i definitely think that.
Really we enjoy what we do so it's just.
A blessing to be able to wake up and do.
What you love every single day but.
Sometimes it does get a little bit.
Overwhelming just little incidents here.
And there that happen and you're just.
Like well this is my life now my life.
Has changed mainly because we show so.
Much i think right just like our daily.
Lives like we show like our daughter.
People see us like that day and they're.
Like oh i know what you wore yesterday.
Saw you yesterday so they really feel.
Like they know you which is amazing but.
Sometimes it can get a little scary.
Giving it giving you a little plump so.
Don't don't mind it i'm gonna jump in.
Adjust it i love with the pump it's okay.
So yes i'm thinking it a little scary.
Because you're showing things that maybe.
You shouldn't be showing so that's one.
Thing that we've had to learn along the.
Way i think everyone on social media has.
To learn that at some point like when i.
First started out i was posting.
Everything and i also got them all a lot.
Of drama.
And my like community as well and would.
Always tweet about it and i was like oh.
I need to stop doing that probably.
Immediately right now since i've kind of.
Matured and grown up in space and just.
Gotten older and really figured out like.
What i can and can't be posting because.
Obviously there's a lot of people.
Watching my life is not like way better.
After figuring that out yeah it's.
Definitely learning as you go you better.
Give me those angles in order to be.
Successful i love giving you a goes in.
Order to be successful well has been der.
Guys's coolest like fan experience we've.
Had a couple everything i brought our.
Fans our woosh furnace sisters even come.
From my best friend's father help me.
Make a halloween constantly here and.
When he did when he finished that i.
Literally said thank you sister marco no.

Similar demographic it's a lot of.
Talking to cid sisters there yeah the.
Boss will get him hello not my usual.
Surroundings right but it was so fun.
Like i thought it was such a cool event.
I saw so many it like amazing people.
That are and how they the best time and.
Often as well i could be a cheerleader.
On the side cheerleader yeah you perform.
Probably shows mr. song yeah sing a.
Sister song i'll sing the national.
Anthem by the way you guys austin and.
Katherine are using oh tada my palette.
With more oh hello it's definitely worth.
It i will say no i'm not just saying.
That we do katherine's eyes using a few.
Of the warm tone shades in the top few.
Rows closing my eyes turned out pretty.
Good in french if i do say so myself.
And he used the highlighter called face.
And it's part of the palette he used.
That for this part of my face that's.
Like shining shimmering splendid awesome.
Walk us through your luxe what do you.
Want to die so right now i'm going for.
Looks like rose a rose petal look erin.
As if you're going on a date really.
Romantic i love you been here for my.
Relationships all day yes so okay good.
Also you're talking on white boy.
Problems earlier and he was doing lots.
Of good advice it's very like this.
Sentiment to look romantic i love them.
Want him to feel like you appreciate.
Know i definitely do alright so you want.
To almost give him your old everything.
You have to offer that's okay i love.
That what are you going for sister well.
I'm going for the lego.
Astronaut.
For the brunch and i oh i love it about.
Brunch by date cell it's like normal to.
Get a snack no i'm going for like a vibe.
We're like you're gonna take instagram.
Picture.
Oh that's a good both good bonsoir i.
Just want you to know that what i'm.
Gonna do there's gonna be a couple.
Things there you never be used to but.
It's so scary to hear what the sentence.
Is gonna finish but i just want you to.
Know that people are gonna think it.
Looks good okay so it just becomes roll.
With whatever you you know you're the.
Artist tonight the whole motto of my.
Campaign is to unleash your inner artist.
And i think that's what it's going on.
Here it's very pigmented belly is mm-hmm.
Have either one of you ever done.
Somebody else's makeup before no what it.
All will start experimenting with makeup.
Will you let her and at what age do you.
Think she's gonna be 30 i'll definitely.
Let her for sure she watches me do my.
Makeup every day as far as like her.
Wearing makeup i don't think i'll let.
Her until she's learning dirt i started.
Wearing makeup at like 14 and it wasn't.
Like obviously wasn't heavy but i wear.
Like some eyeliner some lipstick.
Brighter like lip gloss i don't want to.
Be that contradicting like tell her she.
Can't wear makeup and here i am i.
Wearing right well awesome there's a.
Reason why you say older because she.
Won't be dating until she's probably 30.
So i think everything will happen when.
She's 30 okay my parents now are like my.
Biggest fans in the entire world but.
Well i first sorry to cut you off i.
Don't like that the sisters can't really.
See what i'm working with.
I'd like to just show first we get okay.
Cuz when you look straight you can't.
Really give him the full sauce whatever.
Saturn what is this it's just it's calm.
I said he's gonna feel comfortable bit.
When i'm done okay it's not fully.
Finished.
Yeah i know when i first are doing we.
Can my parents were definitely like.
Concerned they want me to wear either.
Just because they thought that i was.
Using it that's like a way to like.
Validate myself or feel good but i kind.
Of explained like it is hard to express.
Yourself next off you're messing up my.
Side i guess.
Not being touched do you have a little.
Sister chapstick thank you nothing judge.
Just yet i know i'm complimenting you oh.
Well thank you give me to look real good.
I'm looking for the glow uh-huh the.
Global scigirls crystal thanks oh i love.
Scripts i need i need a little bit well.
There is a beautiful red shade in the.
Palette i see okay awesome obviously.
Sometimes when you dm me about what like.
We wanted to do a video together i was.
Excited.
Cuz i think you guys don't really do.
Collabs that often i don't really see.
You anyway.
Yeah youtuber s you guys obviously live.
A very private life right who like are.
Some of your favorite people to walked.
In the community i think since i'm like.
All about like learning i love to learn.
Yeah i love to keep up with like what.
Everyone is doing.
I watch everyone i got watch people from.
What you do you're all people from doing.
Like parkour from doing like the eating.
Challenges like literally everyone even.
Little baby kids channels yeah i do my.
Research i studied i'm not really a fan.
Of nobody or watch like someone specific.
Or just watch people over and over i.
Just study the entire market so it's.
Important to be knowledgeable of the.
Space that you're working at exactly.
Yeah i watch a lot of people too.
So when people say like oh do you know.
About this person yes i know about them.
Because i study what they do right and i.
Feel like everyone should because you.
Should be up-to-date with what's going.
Almost a new trend.
Ya know it's definitely stressful it.
Takes how are you like he'll be like oh.
H like this is a cool idea or like hey.
Did you know about this and i'm just.
Like my phone's dead.
My biggest thing is like trying to stay.
Ahead of the curve like one step ahead.
Saying what's out there you know and by.
Doing that you should you have to know.
What everyone else is doing right is.
There anybody that you like watching for.
The inspiration there's anybody that you.
Like think is really killing it right.
Now you you for sure i was trying to.
Hire you myself but you over there doing.
