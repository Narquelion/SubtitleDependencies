I've wrestled people who smell like.
Like literal like poop the last two.
Years like two years ago we did decent i.
Don't know maybe like 150 k for the year.
And then last year we did like 250 k are.
You having class please do that for.
Claps yeah yeah i guess that makes sense.
That we usually yeah i mean it is a.
Weird thing even when we first put it on.
We're like all hearing yourself is such.
A weird you know like you take it but.
You're not you do it haunting yourself.
Or like listening to your division it's.
Different when it's alive - yeah i guess.
So and especially it's worse if there's.
A little bit of a delay this is the.
Longest intro we've ever did i did not.
Intro welcome back to the pihl podcast.
Today we are joined with our very close.
Friend mr. jacob foo popular in the.
Moderator seat as well that's all you.
Get you need to earn your class for.
Those of you who don't know jacob foo is.
The brother of josh foo josh was with us.
For a little bit yeah and we have josh.
Josh is move back to atlanta where you.

These kind of jokes usually off-camera.
And we have ryan higa in the modern host.

I want to do that i want to play with.
One day we should switch i'm down all.
Right.

After the shishi break yeah this is.
Jacob tell more about your relationship.
Well let's talk about just i guess we.
Can talk about just you can explain.
Actually what you do yeah talk about how.
We met and stuff we'll get into that.
Later buildable jacob yeah but it built.
You telling your relationship builds.
This jake okay.
S-sir and is there's my wife we moved.
Back to vegas in february so we live.
Here now we're on a travel blog.
Full-time and for the past six years.
We've been moving to a new city every.
Year to write about the city.
Um the surrounding area nomads nomads.
It's kind of this one a nomad is right.
Somebody who doesn't have a like yeah.
Yeah this is long as they please for a.
While you guys are gypsies yeah yep.
Basically and he's pretty humble but.
Their blog is like one of the biggest.
Right travel vlogs.
Yeah it's if not the biggest travel blog.
Not the biggest but it's it's the.
Biggest travel what's up there yes it is.
Vegas yeah i'm just saying it's the.
Local adventurer local adventurer i.
Don't normally read blogs but like like.
You were saying cuz i was asking we were.
Talking about this beforehand yeah i.
Thought your fan base was just like like.
A really small dedicated not small but.
Very dedicated fan base but you were.
Saying that a lot of times it's it's.
Just people constantly coming in and.
Checking all random articles and yeah i.
Mean i think it's partly because of the.
Way we built the blog when esther.
Started it it was primarily because she.
Couldn't find the information that she.
Wanted uh-huh so she's neither of us are.
Like we're not great writers we don't.
Really like writing like stories per se.
But we like to find information and give.
That information to people so that's.
Kind of how the site was built and so i.
Think it's more of a resource than it is.
Like people following our personal lives.
Right yeah what's so funny all right.
Jacob we're cool right yeah all right.
You know if i throw out some some small.
Burns here and there then what do you do.
Just just keep moving on keep moving.
Yeah yeah no i don't know i had last.
Time with the kevin thing there's a lot.
Of people were like i don't like that.
Punk was going after kevin like that.
They're probably not gonna defend me as.
Much it'll probably make the don't think.
You're you're a jerk or dick or whatever.
It sounds funny i think it was pretty.
Apparent that you guys really yeah but.
There's some people who are dumb i think.
You just just get very.
Offended but not i just get surprised.
That there are people that you get wrong.
You're pretty sensitive i'm not i'm.
Hardest look at this body.
Dude ah i went to gym once this week.
With that being said i guess we're.
Jumping back into i don't remember cuz.
You know poor it laughing yeah they're.
Right i met jacob and i met you i met.
Jacob on internet icon.
Yeah sure that we did that was basically.
Like american idol but for hubert yeah.
Yeah i guess yeah at the time especially.
And that's where i met paco as well but.
The following season we only did two.
Seasons and and and j and jacob was a.
Finalist with his brother no he well i.
Wasn't a final what did you get i got.
Fourth but we both got eliminated.
Basically on the same episode right.
Before the finals kiss season 2 had.
Three finalists yeah yeah i don't.
Remember if i voted to get rid of you.
Guys or not yeah i don't remember i.
Don't know i think it was kassim it.
Might it might be i don't think he liked.
Us i think he liked lana and the right.
Elves were kind of a shoo-in right elves.
Were killing it yeah the rhinos were.
Shooting so it was between us and lana.
And i think he just like lana better.
Pewdiepie didn't like me because he's a.
Racist and and he just hates me.
Now that's we're gonna screen cap that.
Put that in the intro hey we got you.
Know what you're i didn't want to be on.
This podcast so we're gonna cause drama.
For um say didn't want to be on it no he.
Did actually he responded to the tweets.
What tweets wait up he just straight up.
Said no thanks well he was kind of like.
What he said is he doesn't want to be on.
Podcast because we asked him to be on.
The podcast.
See now now you're revealing who runs.
The twitter i know i'm not revealing.
It's not me but you're narrowing it down.
It's pretty obvious that it's not me.
Writing the twitter i get that i see it.
After the fact when it gets narrowed.
Down to oh these are good questions for.
So-and-so.
Yeah but basically the the whoever is.
Handling the twitter was like oh yeah.
Would you like to be on the podcast and.
Eat on one of his videos.
He saw it and basically like roasted it.
Was like wow you're pretty much saying.
That your fans want me to be on the.
Podcast but not you.
It is just like damn that's very true.
And also he was like he doesn't want to.
Do a podcast because like media will.
Take things and like twist it in a way.
And you know he just don't want to be.
Responsible he just gets done by yeah.
Yeah exactly so that's why he's like i.
Don't wanna do it he has to be very.
Careful with what he says which is very.
Understandable.
People always yeah that's how i argue.
That's how we were an internet icon we.
And like josh and i had this.
Conversation before you guys started.
Filming like they can take anything we.
Say and twist it yep we should just make.
Sure we're always super nice but then we.
Got cut out of everything because that's.
How reality shows work but don't realize.
Like even the most realistic ones it's.
There's no real reality show oh yeah.
Other than being like i mean like.
Youtube like vlogging and then even then.
You don't know for sure that it's being.
Like a hundred percent real you don't.
Know what they're cutting you don't know.
If they're acting but most reality shows.
It's like unless you're crazy or you.
Know that's usually how they get you.
That that's how you get screen time yep.
But i'm gonna cause drama.
Yeah i've witnessed that when we were.
Filming that show i wouldn't stat.
Firsthand i was like oh this is so.
Interesting because we had producers and.
Stuff and directors that have done this.
Before and i was just like so interested.
In like their their discussions is like.
How can we throw a wrench into like.
Things are going too well for people how.
Can we throw a wrench into i was like.
Wow that so this is how it works this is.
Interested they specifically talk crap.
About anybody um i don't remember it was.
Probably the earlier episodes because.
Search the ending it was like the people.
That were great for the show and that.
We're good you know it wasn't like fan.
Voting because that would have been too.
Costly to have to have live fat boats.
Yeah figuring that stuff out so it was.
Based on like the judges and none of.
That was fake like we actually came to a.
Consensus but then they would have a say.
They they would give their.
Recommendations like this guy is like so.
Not good on camera or this person is a.
You know really good yeah.
So what was your impression on of paco i.
Was the one i was on like to him.
Initially you know because i didn't.
Really know him yeah i i'm editing this.
So i can just cut it you could write.
That boy you could i could just watch.
Put it back i mean i mean i liked them.
They were you guys were on the show so.
Obviously i liked you guys actually no.
You guys did really well yeah to a guest.
I mean what not it would do really well.
Yeah so i mean you're currently still.
Doing this blog it's very successful i.
Saw yeah i found this so interesting.
Because i want to go check it out.
Because obviously i wanted to do some.
Research you know really read blogs but.
I find it really interesting that you.
Posted you guys post your earnings we do.
This past month.
You made $21,000 well a little more than.
That off just doing that blog have.
Sponsorships and they show their whole.
Breakdown they show your costs i think.
And i thought that was like that's.
Fascinating for one like why did you.
Decide to to show that because it's very.
Private thing and then also how are not.
The easiest thing to get around you know.
I mean like it's very specific also are.
You hiring yeah but usually people you.
Know it's funny it's like we make these.
Same jokes.
Yeah but then like when guests make it.
It's like well it's all adding up it's.
Very hard future employer.
I'd watch this go ahead we're looking.
For like you know the gregg quality like.
Yeah so we we were really it took us it.
Was a lot of debate over sharing our.
Income reports every month but i think.
The idea was we wanted to show other.
Aspiring bloggers how we do what we do.
Right and so it was supposed to be a.
Resource yeah it's a really private.
Thing and we don't want to post it to be.
Like bragging about anything didn't come.
Across anything that sort is really to.
Show because i think there's a we get.
The question a lot like.
How are you guys doing this full-time or.
What are you and i'm sure you get that.
Question as like a youtuber like anymore.
Yeah i guess it's more common back in.
The day when i can make money all the.
Time for blogs it's still pretty a.
Mystery you know.
Yeah so it's uh we we posted it up just.
Really for that reason to show people it.
Can be done because i really believe.
That people can do what they want and.
Chase their dreams in like a responsible.
Way that's a very nice thing to say.
Yeah but you know what though i mean i i.
Found cuz i read i read that one and i.
Was interesting cuz you or i don't know.
A faster wrote it but you were talking.
About like initially so when did you.
Guys i guess what i'm asking is when did.
You start and then how did it okay.
Because initially you she said you would.
You made like 50 bucks in a month we.
Made them wants nothing at the beginning.
And primarily because we didn't know how.
To make money right so esther started.
The blog actually when we moved to la to.
Do youtube so esther was doing was at.
2013 okay relatively recent yeah so she.
Started too then because we she had a.
Wedding photography business before that.
And we left atlanta she was looking for.
Something new to do and just started to.
Post about our travels because we just.
Like to travel and then she realized.
That people were doing this full-time.
And so started doing some research of.
Like okay how do i do this more.
Strategically and be smart about it and.
So started to build that up and then.
When we moved to vegas the first time.
That's when like there's they're good.
Like just a little snowball effect right.
Like there was there are more people.
Finding the blog it was getting a bigger.
Audience and she's amazing on the.
Backend creative side but needed help on.
The business side so that's when i see.
You youtube and then decided to help oh.
So when that was going that was like.
What what year was money for remembering.
Yeah 2014 20 did you guys just we're.
Just leaving vegas yeah yeah we when.
Josh stayed right so what at what i mean.
If it's not to person i guess it's not.
Personal you're posting about it yeah in.
That first when you that first month.
When you decided to stop doing youtube.
What was your income at that point.
Honestly i don't remember then.
It was definitely not enough to be.
Sustainable right but that's why it's.
Interesting because to take that leap ya.
Know to go in a completely different.
Direction in something that's not making.
Anything really we saw i think it's just.
That i saw the potential and we so this.
Is the same with youtube we we didn't.
Make a crazy amount of money but we made.
Enough to make a living off of it right.
For two years especially if you live in.
Vegas yes vegas is so much cheaper.
Atlanta the same it's about the same.
Yeah yeah.
California is way too expensive yeah but.
We gave ourselves a year initially when.
We moved to la to say like if we can.
Make enough money to make a living then.
We'll try again for another year and.
Then we came out to vegas to do the same.
Thing and we weren't really seeing the.
Growth that we wanted to so that's what.
I'm talking about like it's good to.
Chase your dreams but be realistic about.
It because we basically give ourselves.
The time frame of like okay we have.
Enough savings to pursue it for a year.
Beyond that you know it's not really.
Responsible for us to do it anymore.
We talked about a very similar thing to.
Before in the past about like i think.
What the question was like aspiring to.
Be a youtuber yeah oh yeah yeah oh it's.
Like the same thing we were saying like.
We don't want to be the people it ended.
Up sounding like don't follow your.
Dreams but it was like the point of like.
Be smart about it.
And no like you have to weigh out the.
Risk like if i had quit youtube yeah.
Right and when i was in college and at.
The time we weren't getting paid really.
Then you have to realize my mom made me.
Realize like hey all your friends will.
Be graduated i mean you have to come.
Back and be with a bunch of kids ya know.
So it's like you weigh out the positives.
And negatives so for you guys like did.
You have a fallback plan um so i think.
We've just always had the mentality that.
Worst case scenario we can go back and.
Get regular jobs right you know when it.
Comes down to it i don't have an issue.
Getting back to i used to work a.
Corporate job i can go back to a.
Corporate job if i need to so in the.
Blog when i when i end up quitting and.
Helping esther where the blog we still.
Had you know we calculated we had enough.
Savings to do like a year and a half two.
Years of like living conservatively to.
See if we can make it happen and then.
That was about when it broke for us like.
The tipping point of it.
Doing well so the last two years like.
Two years ago we did decent i don't know.
Maybe like 150 k for the year and then.
Last year we did like 250 k so we were.
Able to grow and scale the business and.
Then in terms of how it's just i think.
It's like youtube in terms of it it's a.
Numbers game.
So for us we have a decent amount of.
People visiting the site every month so.
We're able to make money off ad revenue.
But then we also do sponsorships and.
Then like a small percentage off.
Affiliate sales so that's like if you.
Were if we tell you hey we bought ninja.
Milk on amazon and give you our link and.
Paco goes to buy it it's still the same.
Price for paco but we make a small.
Percentage of that right because you're.
Still bringing people to this thing and.
And you're putting your stamp on it.
Yes entually and your stamp is valuable.
Now so i was wondering about that.
Because what if have you ever have you.
Ever endorsed anything or about a place.
That you did not a hundred percent like.
Let's say you did oh completely loved it.
Especially at the beginning oh really.
Yeah because at the beginning when when.
You it's like i bet you can remember.
Like brand deals early on definitely.
Where you're just excited for the first.
Brand deal i think the biggest regret we.
Had was bud light lime really good yeah.
We got that and we're like we hadn't.
Even tried it we tried it work this is.
Disgusting i put my bud light lime.
Really i just you know i wouldn't drink.
A lot of it yeah i mean like i don't.
Mind it i hated it like we but like for.
Me it's like i also signed a contract so.
I was gonna be professional about yeah.
I'm gonna do it i don't think we wrote.
Raving reviews about it but we also.
Didn't say we did it right you know.
Here's a new thing yeah exactly.
What didn't you like i think i wouldn't.
Know if i was reading i was like oh yeah.
I'm sure you know yeah i'm sure if you.
Go back i think it's still on our site.
You could probably tell that we didn't.
Like it really but yeah i think it's.
Like lessons learned you know we learned.
Okay we shouldn't endorse products that.
We don't like because it just ruins the.
Integrity exactly yeah i had to learn.
That too.
Yeah the hard way but i mean it was even.
More so.
Like back in the day on youtube we're.
Laying in view even if it was a product.
You liked what just did hated you yeah.
Any brand deals like all of this ron.
Used to be so genuine and so like he.
Wasn't a cell and then the moment you do.
Something that you even even if it's a.
Product you like it's like you're a.
Sellout.
It's different now though people are.
More open to it yeah we didn't have any.
Ad reads today but thanks to ninja milk.
For sponsoring this happens is are a lot.
More open today you still kind of.
Refrain from doing a lot of brand deals.
And you do have opportunity for the.
Podcast we do some we do it oh yeah.
There that we're very selective with it.
So i think this is very interesting.
Because you come from a place where like.
You said your ad revenues really does.
Really well but brand deals i'm sure.
That's like a huge end that it is a lot.
With staring or tea ryan is more like.
Adsense or whatever you get i mean i.
Should be doing more brand deals usually.
I'm just it's different when like for.
Like the podcasts like this is it's a.
Lot easier cuz it's just you know you do.
A read and if it's something that like.
Oh yeah i could use that or i used it.
It's super easy yeah because we're just.
Talking about but if it's like oh make.
Up like a trailer like one of those like.
Fake trailers around this product or.
Something and it doesn't if it's not.
Funny or like cool or interesting and.
That's not a easy thing to do without a.
Product if you throw a product in there.
It just kind of ruins it yeah you know i.
Think there's a difference though the.
Type of content you're building is very.
Different it's not yeah vlog ii or just.
Challenge videos that you could just.
Throw the product into right you're.
Doing like fully scripted stuff yeah so.
A second channel view is obvious.
Yeah like play game or like do whatever.
But yeah making a whole skit around the.
Product is not that easy so you get a.
Lot of crap for that - well this is a.
Dope-ass video like fortnight yeah what.
That one wasn't like fortnight came to.
Me i had the idea and i went to.
Fortnight and let's talk about that i.
Guess because there are a lot of brands.
That go to you but you know you you kind.
Of don't you rarely ever like i put a.
Second thought into it at first you had.
To reach out for brands but now brands.
Are coming out to you.
Still mix but yeah yeah for sure and how.
Did you start that off because you know.
Like being like oh check out our blog is.
Very like legitimate and everything yeah.
Out to the car yes so i mean my.
Background is in sales and account.
Managing so i kind of knew how to do.
That already but it was essentially of.
Putting together like a media kit or.
Putting together like a basic deck of.
Your numbers and then just reaching out.
And saying this is what we want to do.
And this is why you should work with us.
So you're saying you make a deck for.
Every single sponsor know that you make.
Like a generalize yeah yeah yeah then.
You pitch with your deck you send it to.
The company or the place you want to go.
To see if yeah it's some kind of sponsor.
Right mm-hmm and ask them a rate yeah.
Interesting.
So for bloggers out there who want to.
Make their own blogs i mean you they.
Should really just check all your blog.
Because that's what you guys talk about.
Right and yeah i actually built a holy.
Course on teaching how to do the brand.
Stuff i'm gonna it's uh you would have.
To do a blog you gotta write a lot no.
I'm not gonna do it but there's a way.
That you can apply it what would i put.
The course together for is geared.
Towards bloggers but all the skills are.
Usable for anything that you do hmm that.
You're trying to sell yourself or like.
For branding your brand is that yeah.
It's on how to how to how to pitch and.
Negotiate yes like this is applicable to.
Like any form of social media yeah.
Instagram youtube twitch whatever you.
Know i think there's like some things.
You have to tweak but for the most part.
It's all skills that you can use.
Anywhere see i think that's interesting.
Because that if people can learn to do.
That or like do it on their own you.
Don't have to go to these other like.
Come like these people these networks.
That are trying to sorry i know you just.
I just joined an mcn yeah yeah a lot of.
That is stuff that people can be doing.
On their own yeah not necessary if they.
Don't have the time but i'm saying.
That's all they do basically a lot of.
What you're what you guys are doing on.
Your own exactly you could easily just.
You know join somebody to help do that.
For you or i mean eventually if you're.
Making up.
You can hire someone to do it for you if.
Yeah i want to do it anymore i mean we.
We use the same thing for us in youtube.
We were part of an mcn but we pitched.
Ourselves a lot mm-hmm - and i think.
That's part of the allow that though.
Don't they take a percentage regardless.
Uh it depends on your contract right i.
Think it's changed now now like the.
Contract that i did i made sure that if.
I found my own see people didn't know.
That before though yeah yeah like a lot.
Of people got screwed and i mean it goes.
With the whole like the whole phase.
Thing that's happening right now right.
Like isn't that their whole situation.
About like the contract that he signed.
It wasn't a good contract yeah what's.
His name t foo sifu.
Yeah his his contract i mean they just.
Released it today what it was and it's.
Not a good contract and they even.
Admitted it but like everyone back in.
The day was just signing this is how you.
Get successful we'll help you out but.
You give away so much and people just.
It's not their fault you're not lawyers.
You know a lot of people just get.
Excited and see opportunity and they see.
Their people they're fans of they how.
Big they got and you just jump into it.
And i would say as a warning just i.
Always tell people because they asked.
Like oh sure way sign with this this is.
What they're offering me just read the.
Contract yeah and i mean i got on.
Yourself too i think that's the thing.
Like most people think contracts are.
Very overwhelming they are they can be.
They can be but i think it's a lot more.
Common sense than you think to like you.
Can just read some of the basic stuff.
That like i don't understand all the.
Legal mumbo-jumbo but there's some.
Things that are like ownership of.
Content you know like some really basic.
Stuff that should be red flags if you.
See it or just ask what ya mean yeah.
Exactly.
There's a lot of times i ask about stuff.
C but what they do is and then think you.
Guys think about this - you're not a 18.
Year old kid yes.
You're not like in your teens or you're.
Not even in your 20s you know and and.
Imagine if you're that young someone's.
Coming at you with this you know do you.
Can be a part of someone so made million.
Million dollars this year he works under.
Our label or under our mcn this could be.
You you know help you get those.
Partnerships we can they pull all these.
Flashy things out there and then you.
Just start signing people sure so it.
Makes sense and sometimes they do help.
But a lot of times i know a lot of.
People who like they are off they get.
Screwed yeah.
Yeah it's just a numbers game yeah i.
Don't know how we got in this topic.
Again well i mean work cuz we were.
Talking about brands and how he kind of.
Initially started right yeah he was.
Finding it for himself and then you.
Talked about how mc ends you know kind.
Of kind of took advantage of it in the.
Early stages of youtube yeah i don't.
Know how that is now i don't know yeah i.
Think people are smarter but this is.
Such it was just a interesting thing.
Because that that whole phase thing was.
Happening yeah i don't know if you know.
More about it you're the you're the up.
To date guy well i mean there's not much.
More to discuss i mean they are.
Releasing the contracts there's already.
Been a lot of videos about it is he.
Still suing then uh he as of this moment.
He still is but he asked his lawyer to.
Kind of like retract a lot of the.
Statements for yeah and then even banks.
Is like yo like you live down the street.
From me why don't we just talk like.
We're gonna just talk in person i feel.
Like in social media now a lot of people.
Feel like if they're the first to out.
Someone yeah the whole internet just.
Jumps on their side yeah because of the.
Whole like canceled culture and stuff.
Yeah but i mean you could easily avoid.
These things by talking about it in.
Person but if you want the numbers if.
You want money you come out you just say.
Any any random thing and then everyone's.
Like what what what and you just get a.
Hell of views well you know what you.
Don't be even crazier like super crazy.
Is if this whole phase thing was planned.
And it's just a phase what if they just.
Planned this together like hey we don't.
Have dropped we haven't had good drama.
Lately yeah like just all pr they're.
Gonna pretend to sue us we're gonna make.
A ton of money i mean i'm not us i'm not.
Accusing them of doing this but they.
Could easily do that yeah look at.
Whenever there's something big about a.
Celebrity it's like oh guess who's.
Albums coming out next week you're like.
In like where they just announced you.
Know like that stuff happens all the.
Time.
So i wouldn't hire people make sense.
That does make sense.
Damn we win is that why you do so much.
Random stuff why just to be like.
Relevant all the time no maybe i should.
Stop doing random stuff yeah you got a.
Baby shoes now we didn't actually do the.
Random things back.
I don't like the way you said it you.
Know it sounded very negative still.
You're just like i'll keep them quiet.
And then what it does something still be.
Disappointed let's not do that.
I love when we have guests that actually.
Know us they always end up roasting you.
So people can see like what the real.
Relations like it's starting to fill it.
Up yeah you're let's say this for the.
The audience that doesn't understand and.
Know our relationship with a lot of.
People like some people would think like.
I'm i'm a douchebag ryan's a douchebag.
Or like is lighting yeah it's never a.
Real argument like i know that we have.
Real arguments well yeah but it's not.
Like we hate each other the other day.
Somebody tweeted it ryan.
This clip of me and ryan wrestling yeah.
Yeah and they're like when is this fight.
Gonna happen again.
And ryan responded.
He's like whenever paco wants it it i.
Was like yeah i said when yeah whenever.
Paco wants to fighting him basically.
Yeah whoo yeah but i would not fight him.
What didn't you want to jam yeah you.
Don't and i said yeah until you wash.
Them no i'm gonna come in as dirty as.
Possible yeah then i don't want this and.
Yeah or any of it strategy exactly every.
Advantage you're actually for wrestling.
Did you ever like not brush your teeth.
The day of a meet or like nobody i've.
Wrestled people who smelt like    like.
Literal like poop and you think they.
Literally well the thing is - it's you.
Never know because wrestling is such a.
Like a intense sport - like in that day.
It's not like even like mma we're like.
The weigh-in yeah day before right and.
Then they're just like they rehydrate.
They we eat like it in the weigh-in room.
That morning you're you're like 20.
Pounds less than you should be no waters.
In your system you know when you have no.
Water and your dehydrator you know what.
Your breath smells like yeah it that.
Like morning breath times a hundred so.
Everyone has that in the room plus you.
Don't care how you smell because you're.
Starving and you're thirsty so i mean it.
There's no excuse for not shower you can.
Still shower when your own.
You still shower i don't know but.
Somebody will really smell sounds like.
People don't wipe by their yeah.
There's there's been some people i feel.
Like i don't know maybe they're trying.
To i mean you see that as a strategy.
Kind of cuz i mean he's already hard to.
Function and breathe yeah i imagine a.
Smell there yeah you know you're trying.
To choke him there are smell although.
That like because they smell i would get.
Upset and it would make me wrestle even.
Harder it's like because normally i'm.
Very caught like even when i wrestled it.
Was like i was very calm yeah a lot like.
People who some people would use anger.
And emotion i never really got like use.
My emotion like i'm the only times ever.
Got mad i have it on video too actually.
And shaun can attest his - cause he was.
There it was somebody like i had like a.
Wrapped finger cuz i was injured and.
Some guy tried to grab it and as i can.
Like the fight like ab regionals or.
Something like that and you could see.
And he was grabbing i was like shaking.
His hand off and i just got pissed and i.
Just destroyed him because like that i.
Don't like you like who does that like.
You haven't he really going hurt me like.
You're already at him advantage so i.
Don't know i think the smelly thing to.
Some i know it's not their fault but.
Sometimes when you smell something.
That's that bad it's like come on dude.
Yeah but you could tell the difference.
Between body odor and poop yeah but this.
Is was gonna say i think you don't.
Realize when you're that desperate to.
Lose weight some people you take.
Diuretics laxatives like maybe he.
Actually did she himself at home yeah.
And it was just like man i just got to.
Get out of here i gotta win or lose i do.
Feel like this setup is like two against.
One.
For what it's literally us always like.
That but even on film days it's like.
Everyone against me yeah i mean you kind.
Of set yourself up for we don't have to.
Get into roast me this way we've done.
This too many episodes it's gonna know.
We need a break and then we'll roast you.
Again yeah talking about breaks it's.
Time for i already been mm-hmm really.
Yeah that's fast alright i guess then.
Xishi break i guess.
Music.
And we're back welcome back to the.
Second half of off the bail podcast um.
Yeah you guys should do a whole episode.
Just like that that's all um and so um.
Npr npr talks and it's something about.
It that's really nice i think it's this.
Claud this asmr it's basically a samar.
Though for like er yes pr it is asmr kit.
Is only talking considering as noir -.
Yeah i think they talk like that english.
Chargers weird sound anything a trigger.
Do you think that triggers do you get.
That thing cuz i try oh i don't get it.
At all either.
Wow no i don't get it.
At lunch today though i wanted to i had.
An idea to start an asmr where i just.
Drink drinks i don't know if that exists.
Should be you literally we just so.
Happened to be talking by and you.
Literally had that i had that thought.
Yeah at lunch today things add up then.
There's something about so you know i.
Was thinking about - i was resisting see.
I recently saw joe rogan his podcast and.
They were talking about you know.
Psychics and like he mean obviously real.
There's there's a debate whether they're.
Real nuttin right some people really.
Believe in it so i'm really don't joe.
Rogan the stance is like they're all bs.
Pretty much but then they were talking.
About and it made me wonder - you know.
How when you like think about somebody.
Calling you or like not not somebody.
Calling somebody you think about.
Somebody and then they call you or.
Laughs yeah that that happens to you.
Guys right never happened to me you.
Never like thought about something.
They'd text you all of a sudden know so.
Here's my thing ever - no that's.
Happened to me but i think what it is.
Though is that you just only notice.
Those yeah like you're always thinking.
About like something or someone and it.
Just happened that that a lot yeah yeah.
It's very coincidental.
Yeah and it's but there's a lot of.
Really like like it happens to me a lot.
Like very very frequent.
And maybe it's just because and it's.
Like random people like people the only.
Time maybe the only time i notice it is.
When i'm thinking of someone that i.
Shouldn't like you haven't talked to you.
After today and then i don't mind my.
Mind is it oh i'm psychic my mind goes.
To like the hut how did it they're.
Listening to me or like they're like.
Like yeah i guess this i get like.
Suspicious i'm a very i guess i guess.
I'm paranoid everyone just has has bugs.
In your house yeah i don't know i just.
My first thought though i started.
Thinking conspiracy i bet you if we were.
To take dna test we probably have.
Chinese in us i mean i think more sure.
Would yes as i'm okay tommy will do.
Right yeah i think all these is just.
Like kind of a mix ya know yeah well i'm.
Gonna start claiming it when they take.
Over the world and then i'm just gonna.
Um i'm also a part you know you're just.
Sitting on the fence for now yeah for.
Now i mean i mean i just never took the.
Test but i'm sure if i did have you.
Taken the test yet.
I've taken the myheritage one not the.
Not the what's the more popular one is.
23 23andme my hair to join honestly was.
Pretty garbage like it was i mean it.
Gave me my results and was like you're.
Asian.
Your that's how they break it down 98%.
Chinese or vietnamese like it wasn't i.
Would think you'd get more of a.
Breakdown than that but it was like this.
Really broad generalization so the guy.
Like they contacted us and sent it to.
See if we wanted to check it out i said.
I check it out first before i write.
About it and that was one of those.
Sounds like i'm not writing about this.
Cuz he's like how how was your how are.
Your results i was like well i found out.
I was asian.
Surprising yeah yeah cuz i thought it'd.
Be cool if i got like a deeper breakdown.
Yeah stuff i didn't know 23andme does.
Like crazy stuff like how short your.
Legs are or like they do weird genetic.
Things to who you're related the people.
You're related to.
I think that's interests all we have.
Yeah cuz somebody we met was like yeah i.
Got a profile that said like you're.
Unlikely to be a sprinter because of.
Your like genetic makeup and what i.
Yeah i didn't this it's even more like.
And as you keep developing it's like hey.
You're probably not successful yeah.
You're probably living hey.
You're living with your mom in her.
Basement just like you're not really.
Gonna do anything in life having.
Interesting to know would you want to.
Know that's the question oh see that.
That is a good question though cuz then.
Are you the type of person to be like.
I'm gonna prove this wrong right.
You know it's personality based at that.
Point so oh what let's take it even.
Further what if these types of tests.
Could be like this is the exact day.
You're gonna die i want you guys to know.
I would want to know - i don't really.
Yeah you wouldn't want to know i don't.
Know man i think as a planner like i'd.
Prefer to plan like maybe it's just good.
To know yeah especially if it's a.
Guarantee yeah i'm not gonna die before.
Then obviously unless i do something.
Super stupid yeah what if it's like but.
What if it's like the matrix to where.
It's like they're telling you this to.
Actually make you live longer or they're.
Taking this and because they because you.
Read it that's why it's coming true.
Yourself of self fulfilling interesting.
Conspiracy i wouldn't i would want it.
You would want to know yeah you would.
Want to know - i don't know i'm on the.
Fence about that one but why cuz like.
You'd be scared to know when you die.
Well if i know when i'm gonna die and so.
I start like oh i know i'm gonna die i.
Should start doing a lot of things.
Before that which sounds good but is.
That really me doing those things.
Because that's what i want to do or am i.
Doing it because i know i have an.
Expiration date i think that's my.
Thinking too much about it yeah nobody.
Know i know what you're so what i'm.
Saying right yeah authentically.
Genuinely you're just thinking about.
This loop and you're gonna be in your.
Own head until you die you crazy over.
Thought myself to death be crazy from it.
All have this expiration date and we.
Looked it up and all of ours are on the.
Same day like what happens on that field.
Trip yeah we just think hey we can't be.
Around each other yes that day i mean.
Yeah but it would you know happen though.
That's the thing so yeah i don't think i.
Would try to avoid it.
Okay okay so you guy said yes you would.
Know when you wanna know yeah would you.
Want to know also how you died yes yeah.
Absolutely sure i don't know why i.
Thought that would be there's movies.
About this right isn't there yeah yeah i.
Would absolutely if i couldn't have the.
Choice to know when and how yeah why not.
Think so too.
Okay haven't you ever thought about that.
Idea i mean you you're more religious.
Right you're like yeah from a christian.
Background and yeah but i always had the.
Thought because i didn't really know i.
Didn't really know i never had to go to.
Church when i was a kid like i always.
Used to think about these kind of things.
Like how it feels to die and like even.
Being like what if however you die you.
Just you know your brains too and i.
Don't know i know the science behind it.
Doesn't make sense but what if that last.
Feeling of whatever you feel is just it.
Just keep you keep feeling that's all.
You're over syria yeah or rest of.
Eternity and it's just like i don't know.
It's a possibility.
Maybe that's considered like hell or.
Like this and then if it's a good.
Experience and that's your version of.
Heaven what i don't know i just have.
Right but what's like what's a good.
Experience in your dad a good expert.
Well some people say they feel euphoric.
Right people who claim who have died and.
Come you know right before you die you.
Feel like there's something release i'm.
Chemical right yeah i don't know that i.
Don't know what it is there's some.
Chemical that's released right before.
You do it like i i don't want to talk.
About it cuz i don't know enough yeah.
But it's something like something you.
Work you feel heard that right as you're.
Dying or something like that and people.
Have said it because they've died and.
Come and or revived or whatever it was.
Hey you know what let's do it man social.
Experiment guys what you're gonna just.
Die yeah hmm you know i don't put social.
Experiment gone wrong well i mean dude.
That's a youtube google thing dude yeah.
There's another episode this can get on.
Mon tires there goes the she she went.
Mad but how would you want to die yeah.
You didn't answer.
Yeah oh and i didn't he but if i had to.
Die in a painful way yeah i would want.
My body to be like stretched like one of.
Those old.
Why torture chambers you know i in the.
Medieval days that sound so why like why.
I think oh man dan i don't believe you.
Like i don't think it would be the most.
Interesting thing like who dies like.
That anymore you know this is just i.
Don't believe you for one and this is.
Very dark.
I don't mind it you know i know other.
People do mind it's alright getting away.
From torturing ourselves to death yeah.
What else do we talk about that's a very.
Interesting segue yourself out of that.
All right.
Game of thrones anybody see that haven't.
Seen it yet.
I'm all out up except for the last.
Season i i'm the only one in here who's.
Seen it yeah but papa doesn't watch.
Shows really ever any if it's popular.
He's got like hipster no i see i'm just.
Trying to watch stuff now because i'm.
Like if i want to make you know if i.
Want to be a comedian and make content.
Stuff i can't you just admit that it's.
Good like shows are good i'm not saying.
They're not you say not means is there a.
Show that you started watching before i.
Got popular and then it got popular and.
You're like oh i'm not gonna watch game.
Of thrones he started watching and i.
Started watching it late yeah okay i was.
On game of thrones lead but last night i.
Did watch scarface.
That's good not as good as i thought it.
Was gonna what's kind of old yeah it's.
Just like they did that was the first.
Time you've seen it yeah and i was just.
Like this is so real like story to it.
You know it's just a lot of like cussing.
And yeah what made you want to watch.
That cuz because i was like oh i should.
Watch classics too so i have like.
References that and things to look up so.
I'm like studying and doing i was like i.
Was like so i google that's like why his.
Scarface so popular and then a lot of.
Reviews are saying scarface was actually.
A really poor movie but the reason why.
Did so well is it's a cult classic.
Amongst like like there's a lot like.
That black and latino communities.
Because it was the first of its kind.
It was just so like different and vulgar.
That a lot of people were like i like it.
You know because it is different i was.
Like okay i can see that well i mean.
That's like somebody i just saw a post.
Somebody posted like oh i'm this years.
Old and it's a picture of me doing like.
The how to be ninja and how to be you.
Know and you go and walk back and watch.
Though you tell somebody hey i grew up.
Watching this and like if they go to.
Those videos i'm embarrassed like i.
Don't want people to today like to watch.
That because if you compared to the.
Content that's out today you know i mean.
Like yeah.
But that's in the same way that movies.
Back then you might have grew up on it.
So you might like oh even if even if.
They go back to watch those videos it.
Might think it's still like oh it was a.
Classic for yeah i'm you go back and.
It's the same thing you go back and.
Watch movies because i watch movies i'm.
Like oh this was bad but i still enjoy.
Watching it because it's like i'm just.
Like reminiscing like harold and kumar.
Music.
It's an older movie no i'm talking like.
Going back to like the movies of like.
Home alone yeah right i saw and you.
Watch it again it's not bad it's just.
Like you compared to like the comedies.
And stuff they have like the effects.
Everything that they have now it's just.
Like this is this would never hold up.
Today but it's a great movie still and.
I'll still watch it yeah a lot of its.
Nostalgia like it's just that that's.
What holds it together i mean like i.
Grew up watching like the x-men cartoon.
Yep.
Yep it's a horrible series if you go.
Back and watch any of those episodes.
Really that bad.
The only cartoon i think that was.
Actually decent was the batman oh wow.
That's like 90s one oh that one for.
Really long remember though remember the.
One where he had the red he turned red.
And black he was like all like young and.
Oh yeah super skinny dude yeah.
Everybody was like may i that resurfaced.
Because you know edward from twilight is.
Playing the new batman he's this verse.
Even pac-man and i was like oh isn't.
That such an interesting choice that.
They picked robber pens him yeah yeah.
But i mean like you like it huh no it's.
Not that just from what i've heard yeah.
And things is like his acting just got.
You know way better and there's clearly.
A reason why the casting directors are.
Looking at him i think i think he's one.
Of those guys who were probably decent.
Actor just unfortunately it was part of.
A really bad franchise well or might not.
Have even been bad it's just like.
Because it was so popular with like a.
Younger demographic yeah it's late it's.
Early and because in our society now.
It's it's like hey let's hate on this.
Cuz it's fun you know that's the thing.
To do so everybody just jump linux yeah.
That thing about vampires i've seen him.
You know why you're one of those it's.
Because it had so much lot like fans.
Anything with a lot of guys like justin.
Bieber his any anyone older than him is.
Like he's well yeah and like i was there.
Like i liked his songs like a lot of his.
Songs i thought were like this is super.
Catchy he's held talented i would make.
Joe and i wouldn't make jokes about him.
Because i was the culture at the time.
Yeah but like it's just cuz he was.
Popular if he wasn't that popular if.
Like he had a he was like indie right.
Going back to like when people not that.
Saying that you just you do that but if.
He was just independent a few people.
Knew about and back then there's this.
Good-looking kid he'd get sign i mean.
He'd be like popular anyway mm-hmm if he.
Was like single i mean who's the current.
Person right now who's like the most.
Popular teen he's weaned on heart i mean.
Like ariana grande kind of a lot of.
People like lover wait a bit lot of.
People like to hate on their kids oh do.
You think yeah swift - well she kind of.
She has a lot of pr issues okay that's.
Not a good example but like you know.
Like you know i'm talking about the last.
Justin bieber's of the world.
One direction it's like they can.
Actually be talented people but because.
Their audience is so crazy and in love.
With them and young it's looked everyone.
Else's like that's so lame yeah what's.
That new girl.
Billy billy i wish ya different though.
But she's not mean she's not made she is.
Mainstream but she's mainstream now in a.
Different she in a different way.
Yeah that's true like if her fans start.
Becoming like i think right now she's in.
That she's becoming that yeah but if her.
Fans start becoming like those hardcore.
Like oh my god.
Defend her at all costs kind of thing.
You know in the way that bts fans you.
Know like their yeah bts is getting tons.
Of heat from people who aren't bts fans.
Because of their fans yeah and it's just.
Like when you're at the top of that list.
You know and you're the hottest thing.
And all these young people who are.
Rooting for you and defending you like.
More than they should be.
It it naturally you're gonna have the.
Opposite effect when you have that much.
Love you need that much heat i wonder if.
It happened with like way back in the.
Day before sexual i'm like i'm like the.
Beatles.
I'm sure there's beatles here so there.
Was yeah and it's at the time and i'm.
Sure like you know now we're like you.
Can say something bad about the beatles.
Yeah in 50 years or 50 in the 50 years.
Right we're just gonna be people were.
Like oh my god how dare you say that.
About justin bieber he's a class he.
Brought our countries together he's the.
Reason why there's peace remember and in.
The history books they talked about when.
He peed in the bucket like you guys.
Remember the classic bucket gate yeah.
Alright when he was like driving drunk.
Yeah and it's really fast yeah same with.
Jake paul logan paul yeah all gonna be.
Part of the history books because of how.
Big they were and they're not gonna be.
Well they might be remembered in.
Different ways but their careers aren't.
Over you know like they still have the.
Hard question if they can still turn it.
Around for what their legacy is gonna be.
Do i feel like even just logan already.
Has for how deep into a hole he was and.
To where he is now it's night and day.
Like he was canceled according to most.
People but he really wasn't you know.
Yeah he's still relevant despite what.
People will say because they're.
Comparing to his the top of his game and.
Ksi said that he would be friends with.
Logan.
I'm jake interested hmm and jake didn't.
Even do anything that crazy i know we.
Didn't even talk about this after that.
Podcast you did you see that we i mean.
You know that we work yeah i did a.
Podcast with him.
He said that he would actually be.
Because we asked could you ever be.
Friends with logan he was like i think i.
Could but i could never be friends with.
Jake thinking that's such a strong.
Statement like so definitive yeah and i.
And he said he's just a bad person.
Wow i was just trying to figure out i.
Was like what like cuz that's how you.
Would talk about logan so like what yeah.
What josy like things can change so are.
You saying just before that we're.
Talking about jay paul and how like.
Justin bieber before that yeah right and.
Then billy eilish.
Yeah oh what i was saying about her.
Right because she's still kind of like.
She's weird right yeah she's kind of.
Like lord when lord just came out yeah.
I'm a weirdo like but like good music.
And just just different like very unique.
And it's a kind of cool yeah it's kind.
Of indie but mainstream indie that makes.
Sense oh yeah yeah i don't know how to.
Describe that kind of music.
What's like it's it's like anti pop.
Right yeah so because it's anti pop a.
Lot of play and i and i just think that.
It's because she's still new it's why.
She's not getting that kind of hate well.
And you know what it all it takes is one.
Scandal one thing she says wrong and.
Then she's gonna build a resume she's.
Young do that's what i mean.
Young people always say something we're.
All like i've seen her interview where.
She's like watching herself from a year.
Ago and like you could take that into.
Like all she's so relatable she's so.
Like you know a normal person but like.
You could take that even that interview.
In another way too.
Yeah so especially if you're on media.
All over the place yeah it's running a.
Marathon.
Yeah and then even if you are perfect.
It's like she's trying so hard to be.
Perfect like you know there's always.
Gonna the bigger you become still think.
It's always a balance the more love you.
Get the more hate you're gonna get yeah.
And everything and i think we can go.
Into that and talk about it especially.
With youtube because both of you guys.
When when you were doing social media.
Uh-huh you had kind of like a clean-cut.
You know family friendly type of brand.
Yep ryan definitely family friendly a.
Lot of times when he swears on the.
Podcast people like oh my gosh he's.
War or something and she but uh so what.
What is the pressure like you know where.
You have to keep it like this but you.
Know your personalities aren't.
Necessarily it wasn't hard i'll tell you.
Me really mean it wasn't hard for me.
Either yeah it doesn't make it it.
Doesn't make it funny like it wasn't the.
Jokes i was writing weren't based on.
What being vulgar like so it's not hard.
I mean sure sometimes you'd be like to.
Say even any an unnecessary f-word is it.
It's like a fart joke it's super easy to.
Make something funnier if you're being.
Vulgar.
It's like shocking i mean i still like.
Fart jokes though thanks.
Abs are swearing i mean i agree i think.
Well we weren't doing like daily.
Vlogging or anything like that either we.
Were very we picked what we curated we.
Curated all our content so it was easy.
To put together what we look like from.
The outside appearance but i mean for us.
It was just the thought of like well a.
We came out like people knew we were.
Christian and i think there's there's a.
Stigma with it that's good and bad and.
We didn't i mean we're pretty i would.
Say we're very laxed about like how our.
Views are it's not like we don't curse.
Or any of that or drink you know like we.
Drink we curse whatever but it's just.
The appearance of we just want to be.
Responsible with our platform because.
People can take that one thing and just.
Twist it like we were talking about.
Earlier so we just kind of chose to say.
Okay well we want to come out make sure.
We have a clean appearance also for.
Brands premieres a lot of business so.
For me our first like when i first.
Started on youtube it was actually more.
Like my content i said the f word i said.
A bunch of stuff like i said    i said.
Like a bunch of like thank you yeah and.
One and also i just didn't think much of.
It right and then i started getting like.
Emails and stuff from like parens and i.
Was still a kid too i mean technically.
Yeah and that's when i realized like oh.
Like there's actually kids most of my.
Fanbase is like not just thirteen to.
Seventeen because that's what you two.
Would show but you're like like.
Five-year-olds i would meet and like.
Eight-year-olds i would meet are.
I'm eating him though they would just i.
Would just see him mocha and then they.
Would be like oh i'm a fan of like him.
You heard me say.
So warrants actually emailed you and.
Said could you add some that some of.
That and then i saw it for myself in.
Person when people started coming up to.
Me yeah i was like yeah i need to chill.
Out on that not for brands at the time.
Cuz i wasn't making any money but it was.
Like oh i should probably not say every.
Good stuff but it wasn't like mila it.
Wasn't that hard like it wasn't like.
That wasn't my thing anyway that's not.
What i wanted to portray i guess yeah i.
So don't i mean even if i'm swearing on.
This it's not like you know i don't.
Think it's not in a context where it's.
Like i'm trying to i'm trying to force.
It i don't know i don't have an issue.
People that swear to be honest yeah and.
It's not like you're swearing every.
Other word yeah it's when it's.
Appropriate and the thing is to like.
People who do talk like that.
If that's just how they speak maybe.
That's how they the way they grew up.
Like i don't have an issue like it's.
Just words i think we give words too.
Much meaning to me personally.
But i also don't get offended easily so.
Yeah that's true but a lot of people in.
The world do and that's why we kept.
Their channels that way yeah yeah pretty.

Honestly because we moved so much is.
Hard to find a haircut person that i.
Trusted he's like hair is a very.
Particular thing and i also my hair grow.
So fast.
I didn't want to pay for haircut every.

Just gotten so used to it it's easier.
For me to cut my hair than until i go.
Out and get a haircut mmm true i know.
It's not a perfect i say if i know how.
Learning to cut my own hair i would.
Probably do that yeah it took me a long.
Time like it used to take make an hour.
To cut my own hair so but your reasoning.
Is different you would only want to.
Learn how to cut your own hair so you.
Don't have to leave your house yes but.
That's what like it's for convenience.
Like i just like and i just like.
Learning the new skill like to be able.
To i don't like that no but you know so.
I probably save so much money and people.
Don't you two would know because i'll.
Cut it really short and i'll wait until.
It's super long that's true right.
I am i am trying to teach kids you know.
How to be smart with your money.
Yeah haircuts aren't cheap they aren't.
Cheap especially good ones yes so if you.
If you just don't mind looking fugly for.
Like a good three weeks to a month you.
Could save a whole you could cut your.
Hair hair cut expenses in half just let.

Side and i don't know why every.
Hairdresser just really liked that for a.
Short amount of time and then every.

You had that for a little bit and he got.
.
Yeah yeah it's from culture.
Appropriation that kind of isn't it.
Interesting how that was like the hot.

Kind of died like people still talk.
About it but it's not like in every like.
Oh someone so appropriated this this.
Isn't like that was like a all these it.
Pc pc news of the week we haven't done.
That in y in a while pc is of the week.
Just real quick culture appropriations.
Not in right now.
No you can still do it and get called.
Out for it but news articles and stuff.
They don't really care about that as.
Much what is the current thing people.
Care about it i would say the most.
Recent one is not immigration it.

Give your opinion about anything having.
To do with pro-life or parole abortion.
Or trying yeah yeah that is the it is.
Not a current just at the yeah at the.
Right time.
This is if you want to have some.
Conversations with people post about it.
And you will upset.
Laughs the world probably both sides i.
Think honestly the new cycle completely.
Changed with this presidency before it.
Was a bivy like more celebrities and.
Like that's what was interesting but.
Because of trump right right.
Every new cycle is always something that.
He causes well if he because he's in the.
News yeah well yeah but like yeah his.
Stuff is so controversial that that's.
Always the hot topic in the news it's.
Something that he's involved in but.
Isn't it funny that when it's in it goes.
And it literally is like people could.
Still be appropriate in cultures but.
They weren't right about it because it's.
Not gonna get them views exact all that.
Matters like i know people are genuinely.
Offended by it but like people really.
Care about their views that's what it.
Really comes down to oh absolutely yeah.
It's whatever remember when people who.
Are mad about als or like super into.

Didn't bring it up i think people would.
Not care oh no there might even be some.
People who done don't even know what.
That is i'm talking about all those.
People that was like a couple years ago.
More than that right feels like more.
Than three to five threes ours but all.
