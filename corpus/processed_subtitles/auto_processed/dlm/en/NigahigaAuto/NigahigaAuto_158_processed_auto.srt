Hey guys so you're probably wondering.
Why do i look like a complete nerd right.
Now it's the shirt i probably look like.
One of those losers that stays home all.
Day and reads all night and doesn't have.
A girlfriend it spends all his time.
Online on the computer well you're wrong.
Cuz i don't read no a lot you guys don't.
Know this especially if you don't watch.
My second channel without my glasses or.
Contacts my vision is pretty much poorer.
I mean i'm almost legally blind what did.
You call me no blind.
I said legally blind not blonde that's.
Not what i heard don't be stomping your.
Lessons and prada shoes that mija it's.
Not even product it's louis vuitton what.
Are you blind or something yes love that.
Movie.
Anyway i'm wearing my glasses because i.
Can't wear my contacts for about a week.
And the reason for that is because i am.
Going to be having eyeball surgery what.
That was terrible here trying to get.
That's better it's really not that bit.
Supposed to be a really safe procedure.
I've always been really careful about.
Protecting my eyes i mean think about.
Your eyeballs are so important and yet.
There's nothing really protecting it.
Other than your eyelids yes these are.
The joke of the body protection.
Committee what a muscle well bone look.
At eyelid till they're all flimsy and my.
Pupil science shows right comes with the.
Glasses like i said i've always been.
Really protective over my i mean i wear.
Sunglasses all the time like when i.
Drive when i'm by the pool when i'm.
Wearing sunglasses even when i'm indoors.
Douche i can't take my eyes in every.
Scenario even in a situation that you.
Would never think about kissing a girl.
With a pointy nose i don't have a pointy.
Nose yeah i love you.
Doosh the only time i let my guard down.
And i'm not proud of it but i broke.
Probably the biggest i rule of all time.
Come on keep up and that's the last time.
I ever win running with scissors but.
Overall how can i lie i know it's a.
Common procedure but there's always that.
One thought in my head like what did.
They mess up and i go blind what if i.
Want to wear glasses again i don't want.
To be a hipster and what about all the.
Memories all the memories with these.
Terrible eyes i mean i'll never be able.
To see this way again.
Okay yeah i need the surgery it's gonna.
Happen in about a week whether i'm.
Afraid that it might go horribly wrong.
Or not so i guess there's just one last.
Thing i have to do it's not easy for me.
To say this look i know you've always.
Been there for me through the good and.
The bad for more than two years that we.
Shared you helped me see the world in a.
Whole new way but this surgery is gonna.
Happen and i'm gonna have to say the.
Diagnosis what just know that i will.
