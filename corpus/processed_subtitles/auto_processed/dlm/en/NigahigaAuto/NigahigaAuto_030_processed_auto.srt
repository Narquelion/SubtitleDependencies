What color is the dress is it black and.
Blue or white and gold or maybe a.
Different color altogether scientists.
Have tried to science it theorists have.
Attempted to theorize so what is the.
True answer is suddenly infamous.
Question find out next on an all new.
Episode of brain gum hello welcome to.
Brain gummies and today we are gonna be.
Solving the mystery of the ever so.
Popular color changing dress but before.
We do that it's important that we warm.
Up our brains a little bit first i have.
My volunteer here named ryan and he's.
Gonna be participating in brain ganas.
Aha that was the first test did you.
Realize ryan that we actually already.
Did the intro sequence and that was the.
Second time we showed him how yeah i.
Mean that just happened right before you.
Introduced yourself see just like ryan.
Here your brain is not warm enough to be.
Ready for such a difficult question such.
As what color is the dress so what we.
Need to do first is warm up that brain.
With a little brain ganas you see if you.
Thought the title sequence was gonna.
Start again then you were completely.
Wrong on to our first game it's called.
The math psyche so this is for all of.
You at home just follow along i'm gonna.
Put up a number of fingers behind my.
Back but before i reveal what that is i.
Want all of you at home to pick a number.
In your head got it.
Good now add five to your original.
Number whatever number you're at now.
Subtract one and now add two now.
Subtract your original number that you.
Started off with because the number.
You're at right now is the exact number.
Of fingers i have up behind my back.
That's right six welcome to brain ganas.
Our next game is called the train saw.
Massacre i'm gonna be using my volunteer.
Ryan but i want all of you at home to.
Follow along so ryan if two trains are.
On the same track headed towards one in.
The train a is going 50 miles per hour.
While train b is going 50 kilometres an.
Hour.
Assuming there's no wind and both trains.
Left the station at the same time what.
Is most likely to be yelled out by the.
Passengers on train a is it a all of the.
Above b help c no or d let go.
How am i supposed to i guess see so.
Close the answers b c and d actually.
Would have been correct if we were.
Talking about train b because it's.
Probably filled with foreigners being.
That they measure in kilometers however.
The question was about train a measured.
In miles brow which means most of the.
Passengers were americans and those are.
Not what americans would say in that.
Scenario i mean even with that that all.
That's left is the letter a all of the.
Above and there's nothing else above it.
So wrong again the answer is actually a.
All of the above you have to think.
Outside of the box with box you see the.
Correct answers were e who cares f this.
Is so dumb g this needs to stop because.
If it doesn't or a to try i couldn't.
Even see those though so that's not.
Really fair right you have to see the.
Full picture ryan i mean after all this.
Is brain gummit and finally we have our.
Last game it's called what do you see on.
The screen probably one of our simpler.
Games all you have to do is tell me what.
Do you see on the screen ryan um the.
Letter a wrong the correct answer is a.
Color red oh i thought you were talking.
Next question what do you see on the.
Screen now do you see the color blue yes.
Wrong again the correct answer is the.
Letter a but you're the one that has the.
Next question what do you see on the.
Screen now well i see the letter a and.
It's colored grey grey spelled with an a.
Or with an e does it matter not really.
Okay i guess with an a then wrong the.
Answer we were looking for gray with an.
Even still wrong what the correct answer.
We were looking for was the letter a.
Colored a light black i don't think.
That's even in however if we were to.
Darken this gray colored a to the color.
Black what do you see on the screen now.
Okay you said that that was the color.
Black correct and nothing physically.
Changed in the image from the last one.
Right indeed okay then the answer has to.
Be the letter a colored black ryan that.
Is absolutely wrong what the correct.
Answer was a ninety degree rotated.
Unfinished drawing of pac-man eating a.
Tic-tac next and final question god what.
Letter do you see on the screen now what.
Letter correct and nothing to do with.
The color right indeed and it's awesome.
Stupid answer like an unfinished drawing.
Of pac-man.
Actual letter in the english alphabet.
That is correct okay this then it has to.
Be the letter a wrong the correct answer.
Was an extremely zoomed in picture of.
The letter b okay but the letter b is.
Made up of a bunch of a's so technically.
My answer wasn't wrong this time right.
Wrong again the b is not made from a.
Bunch of aids then what is it made of.
Then unfinished pac-man drawing no son.
Of them and finally now that your brain.
Is warmed up and ready we'll ask the.
Question once again what color is the.
Dress well now that your brain is.
Prepared you can finally see the full.
Picture and i'll answer your question.
With another question is the dress even.
A dress people assumed that it was.
Addressed when really if you do what.
I've been telling you to do throughout.
This entire episode and see the full.
Picture you'll see that this infamous.
Dress is actually a shirt it's a shirt.
How it all makes sense why you have me.
Doing all those stupid exercise this.
Whole time everybody was arguing about.
The color of the dress but when you look.
At the full picture the true answer to.
The question is it's a shirt wrong what.
The correct answer is actually a.
Seriously you made me and the audience.
Go through all of this and you're not.
Only gonna give us a serious answer i.
Did answer it the answer is a that makes.
No sense what does the letter a have.
Anything to do with the color of the.
Dress well not the letter a the answer.
Is a you have to see the full picture.
Remember you have to think outside the.
Box the answer is actually a.
All of the above yep and the next time.
Somebody asks you the question what.
Color is the dress all you have to do is.
Say a all of the above who cares this is.
So stupid this needs to stop because if.
