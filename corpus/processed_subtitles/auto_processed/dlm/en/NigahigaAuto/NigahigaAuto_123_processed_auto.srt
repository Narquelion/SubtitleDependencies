Hey guys so i've been watching just a.
Tiny bit of anime more than usual and to.
Be honest i i did not do my hair you.
Know what give me one second there we go.
Like i said i've been watching a little.
Bit of anime lately and if you grow up.
Watching anime your whole life like i.
Did you tend to not hear about or even.
Notice all the really weird things that.
Happen in anime well for a while like i.
Kind of stopped watching enemies and.
Only recently got back into it you know.
I'm one of those binge watches when it.
Comes to show us i like to watch a bunch.
Of episodes in a row and then stop for a.
While so the episodes filled up so that.
I can watch a bunch again i don't know.
It just it's upsetting to me you know it.
Really pisses me off they always end on.
A cliffhanger and then we make you want.
To know what's gonna happen next but you.
Can't know until a week from now and you.
Know what's even more upsetting with.
Animes is when you wait the whole week.
For an episode and you finally tuned in.
And it's time to watch the new episode.
And it turns out that that episode is a.
Dare i say a filler that what are you.
Guys doing in here if vlog is taking too.
Long.
Seriously you complain about fillers and.
This is literally turning into one yeah.
So get to the point already.
Okay um welcome to how to how to be.
Anime stuff.
Welcome to how to be an anime superhero.
Let's let's get started lesson 1 the.
Characters the first step in being an.
Anime superhero is to know the different.
Characters oh anime have very similar.
Characters to one another first off.
There's the main character who's either.
Really cool and super strong or he's.
Really goofy and funny and receptively.
Strong then there's the main supporting.
Character who's either the main.
Characters best friend or the main.
Characters rival and this supporting.
Character is based off of the main.
Character he's literally the opposite of.
What the main character is the main.
Character.
Cool then this guy is goofy if the main.
Characters goofy then this guy's cool.
After that we have another main.
Supporting character known as the.
Attractive but abusive girl which for.
Some reason always abuses one of the.
Other main characters whoever's playing.
The goofy one also there might be a.
Random type of bet that follows the gang.
Around as well and that's pretty much.
Your group of main characters of course.
There's also the lesser important.
Characters as well such as the perverted.
Old man character the cute girl will.
Always talks while she smiles with her.
Eyes closed the guy who was animated.
Differently from the others for some.
Reason the chubby guy that's always.
Eating or the really skinny girl that.
Eats like a chubby guy and so on.
Put it honestly you don't really need to.
Know anything about those characters cuz.
They're not as important to the.
Storyline even though you probably will.
Eventually learn everything about them.
Because of the dam fillers lesson -.
Anime emotions now that you know all the.
Enemy characters it's time to act like.
Well here are some very basic anime.
Motions that all anime superheroes need.
To use such as the cheek blush the cheek.
Blush is basically or whenever your love.
Interest enters the room the hands.
Overhead lap very nervous situations or.
Trying to hide a secret of some sort do.
You use the hands overhead laugh the.
Thumbs up shiny teeth ding the i pull.
Tongue dis the wide mouth stutter and of.
Course you cannot forget the classics.
The nosebleed whenever a man.
Specifically an old man sees something.
Even the tiniest bit sexual for some.
Reason he has a tiny little nosebleed.
Don't worry about.
I love that lipstick thank you so here.
On you let me try okay.
Music.
Lesson three battling every good anime.
Has some kind of battle in it whether.
It's actual fighting or supernatural.
Fighting sometimes it's not even.
Fighting at all regardless there's.
Always some kind of battle and in order.
To make it an anime battle you have to.
Follow a specific set of rules for.
Example in most real fights you want to.
Win as fast as possible but anatomies.
The opposite you want to prolong the.
Fight as long as you can by talking to.
Your opponent the entire time even right.
In the middle of the fight wait jeez man.
What can we do at least take a moment so.
I can say something like wow you're a.
Lot stronger than i thought you were.
Something i guess okay wow wow much.
Stronger than i thought you were hello.
What don't you have something to say.
Back to me like oh uh thank you another.
Very important rule for battling like an.
Anime hero is to take turns yeah in a.
Real fight you might want to dominate.
The entire fight and just win right away.
But in anime battles you and your.
Opponent need to take turns having the.
Upper hand and also very important while.
You guys are doing the back and forth.
Make sure that you're thinking about it.
Loudly in your head so that the viewer.
Knows who's winning at the time don't.
Want them to be confused.
Matched no it's getting even stronger.
Yes the upper hand now this rate i'll be.
Destroyed now or never.
Music.

Same here i guess we can only read each.
Other's minds.
Wonder what that mean maybe like we're.
Related some spoiler less than for.
Google it now this is a very important.
Lesson to being an enemy superhero.
Especially for someone like me every.
Great anime is in japanese and if you're.
Just like me you don't speak a single.
Word of it hence lesson for googling all.
You have to do is type in what you want.
To say listen to what it sounds like and.
Then repeat it back perfectly it's 100%.
Accurate every single time or should i.
Say my gosh accent doe say aku this mic.
I go say anchor tag yeah lesson 5 make.
An episode the last lesson you need to.
Know to be a true anime superhero is to.
Make a true anime episode yes there's.
Rules here as well you can't just jump.
Right into the story that's not how it.
Works in the anime world first of all.
You need an opening theme song which.
Pretty much sounds like japanese rock.
Music with the occasional english line.
And you accompany that theme song with a.
Bunch of random scenes from the show.
Whether it's characters or people.
Punching and kicking or trees or water.
Whatever it is it doesn't really matter.
Because this is the part the viewers.
Gonna skip anyway next you have to recap.
The previous episodes we all know that.
Anime watchers have the memory capacity.
Of a two-year-old and last but not least.
All you have to do is show the title and.
The episode number that the viewer is on.
And you're ready to begin the episode.
Right after you recap the recap that the.
Viewer just saw there you have it if you.
Follow all of these lessons and put it.
All together congratulations you are an.
Anime superhero and it should look a.
