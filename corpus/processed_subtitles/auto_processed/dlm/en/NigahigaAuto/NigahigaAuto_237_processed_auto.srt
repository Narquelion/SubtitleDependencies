Aren't you tired of watching those.
Campaign ads where all they do is brag.
About what they've done my policies will.
Make things better or list an entire.
Commercial talking crap about another.
Candidate that's his policy and it's a.
Bad policy or maybe you're like me and.
You just kind of seen those ads but they.
Don't wrap the numbers and facts at you.
They don't even understand over 4.2.
Million is definitely a big number.
Hi i'm writing if you vote for me you'll.
Never watch another campaign ad again.
Today i say to you that the challenges.
We face today or indeed geology and we.
Will face them today he has a plan to.
Improve the economy the economy has no.
Leg room you know it needs to be more.
Like first class he cares about your.
Issue access education unemployment.
These are all words he knows things no.
One else knows starships are indeed.
Meant to fly not only will we make.
Healthcare free but it will be forced.
He's creating new job opportunities.
Every day what if we start hiring people.
To be your feet for a day he is a master.
At the art of debating some even call.
Him the master debater and put it off.
The country steps.
Why don't you deficit your ass down.
He picks up trash off the ground and.
Almost makes it in he helps old people.
Cross the street almost look away he.
Even finishes the narrator's scent this.
Is sentences.
He's a poop scooping hula-hooping.
Dancing singing good at swinging rock.
Picking table hitting diplo to see.
Babysitting presidential candidate four.
Years ago you elected the first black.
President now you can elect the first.
Black president that is asian.
I'm right either and i approve this so.
Then you over coming out today.
And god bless.
