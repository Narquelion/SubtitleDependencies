People always ask why did why tfn and i.
Think the catalyst to that was because.
Of that tour you ever make love to your.
Music no that would be super awkward.
With the clapper claps right away.
Everybody okay welcome back to another.
Half the peel podcast today i thought it.
Was the i thought the audience come to.
Me just a kiss you are messing up today.
So right before we got started there's.
Been a lot of technical difficulties on.
The part of paco but we are here with a.
Very special guest his name is jr. akeno.
This is when the applause was supposed.
Some of you might know who he is it was.
Thanks man sorry we've been having.
Really a lot of issues with getting this.
Thing started no we're good we're here.
About an hour to get this thing started.
But we're good and jerry's here but.
Before we get started what is lucid.
Dreaming again lucid dreaming is.
Basically just you're aware that you're.
Dreaming so you can control it you can.
Literally do whatever you want like i've.
Never done it that's why i want to.
Actually see that it's not the other.
Thing no it wasn't the movie into your.
Thing of insidious insidious oh what is.
Inception no it's not it's not your.
Projections okay enough astral.
Projection is i think it's just it's.
Just seeing yourself sleep i don't know.
What it's called just autobody.
Experience and you kind of just see.
Yourself sleep okay.
So i think i've done that before or or i.
Was dreaming that i was doing it.
Regardless it's very boring oh i know in.
That dream or when if i was actually.
Doing it i was like i thought it was.
Lucid dreaming because i was awake while.
It was happening but i was like okay i.
Want to fly through this roof and i.
Couldn't i was just like watching i was.
On the ceiling stuck there looking at.
Myself sleep oh that's lame i know and.
It wasn't scary this is before it's like.
A livestream yeah and i'm just watching.
Myself sleep which is already kind of.
Weird but i'm aware of it i'm like oh.
This must be loose.
I thought like i felt my body lift up.
And i could see myself sleep and it was.
Just so boring but then lucid dreaming.
Dreaming is when you can you're aware.
Whatever part of your dream you don't.
Even have to be like coming out of your.
Body or whatever it's like you're just.
In the dream and you're aware like.
There's certain triggers i guess that.
You uh you can you can do like counting.
How many fingers you have or looking at.
Watching your hand or something like.
That.
Oh you have to trick you're not trick.
Yourself you have to um need some kind.
Of way to tell yourself that you're.
Dreaming gotcha once you realize you're.
Dreaming you have complete control over.
The world you can do whatever you want.
You can fly you can have a celebrity.
Appear is kind of like inception in.
A way then i guess so i'm not i kind of.
Forget how inception worked well inside.
Is like it is controlling your dream but.
To pick it uh yeah that to its inception.
Was the whole idea of like planting a.
Dream yeah right planting an idea inside.
Of somebody right.
Yeah lucid dreaming be tight i would.
Like i would actually probably just uh.
Be in a zombie apocalypse you would want.
That to happen only because then i could.
Have my you know like you have your.
Whole load out like i'd have a bunch of.
Guns oh yeah you know what i mean and i.
Just go through and like merc everything.
Hey would you just lost our monetization.
By saying guns you know yo i'm not in.
I'm not me i'm not on youtube yo.
Straight streets mystery my heart of.
Smell your spotify now yeah but i heard.
Spotify is actually well going back to.
That yeah so so last time that's our.
Last podcast i think we called it we.
Talked about the momo challenge you.
Heard about that right oh yeah so we had.
It in like the title and it wasn't we.
Weren't like promoting it or anything we.
Just talked about it like how we're.
Doing right now.
Okay but i know better now we had it in.
The title and and they freaking flag the.
Video yeah it had lost monetization is.
He tough no it's soft its placid yes.
So jr. is an og youtuber you've been.
Around since oh six-six-six on the same.
Time follow bow so you got started like.
I'll let you tell it how you got started.
I started i was born and raised from.
Anchorage alaska and shout out nine oh.
Seven eight nine oh seven was good to.
Everybody out there stan woman nicole is.
There yes hood everywhere i'm just super.
Like offended that he don't ya just grew.
Up being filipino i you know just saying.
Karaoke you know and did a bunch of like.
School events banquets and all that.
Stuff singing at that stuff and it.
Wasn't until i was like 16 15 16 i did.
American idol and i made it to the top.
44 of that year that was carrie.
Underwood season and season is that.
Season full course and four okay i.
Thought she was one of those who am i.
Thinking of then i don't she blew up.
Really big but she's not the winner you.
Might think clay aiken cleared out you.
Know it's a girl i don't know jennifer.
Hudson win which i know she didn't she's.
The one but kenneth underhood carrie.
Underwood season 4 season 4 that's when.
You're on yeah carrie underwood and yeah.
I did that how old are you at the time 6.
16 15 16 so i was the youngest actually.
In that scene in that in that in the top.
44 wow.
It was kind of cool cuz with that one i.
Kind of didn't know where i stood in the.
Whole like how good i was i guess they.
Didn't know how good you were.
Yeah because it was like okay i knew i.
Could sing but like am i really gonna do.
How do i stand against other people if.
No comparison yeah no comparison you're.
16 yeah 16 i mean.
From anchorage alaska being a small.
Place and this is before the internet -.
So it's like oh i really don't know.
Anything outside of before i was popping.
Yeah yeah and i yeah i made it to the.
Top 44 and i was i got a hundred.
Thousand people sold out at that i was.
Like okay this actually could be a thing.
So i went through high school and then.
It was it was like the first semester of.
College and i was on that's this this.
New site called youtube and i saw a.
Video by david choi friend of the show.
Right yep yes i saw the him playing the.
Youtube song yeah he's playing was.
Featured yes all iphone exactly yeah and.
Then i was like oh this looks cool looks.
Fun like and back then we're not.
Thinking anything of it we're just like.
Just gonna throw a video up and i and i.
Was like oh cool and then so i put up a.
Video and like i don't even look at it.
If it was out of sync it was so bad no.
This story yeah i told him i told him.
Like several times i think a lot of.
People would not necessarily inspire.
Bird like a at asian dude that.
Relatability yeah and yeah i just put up.
A video and then didn't look at it for.
It and then two weeks later looked at it.
Again it was like 10 comments and 150.
Views and we're talking about how.
Alaska's i mean it's so far that a lot.
Of people consider it like another yeah.
Yeah same way to hawaii a lot of times i.
Mean i don't correct them hawaii's.
Another country that they say like how's.
It like moving to the states i was like.
Yeah we are us yeah i don't correct them.
But i just go with or whenever they're.
Visiting that hawaii and they're like oh.
I got to go back to the states.
Yeah i'm like you see me now alaska is a.
Very i mean hawaii is very different.
Last is very different - yeah we're both.
Different yeah yeah for sure well it's.
Crazy because some people.
Don't even know where alaska is because.
They cuz you know in some of the maps.
Hawaii and alaska like some people.
Really think yeah like i'm all y'all.
They're like wait unless you know damn i.
Wish it was right next to each other you.
Know find the ones we bomb or it'd be so.
Worse for us you know you never would.
Have moved then then you're right anyway.
Alaska is so different that they have.
Like i don't even know how many shows.
But i only know that cuz my mom watches.
It religiously and she's addicted to.
Them i mean it's it looks beautiful but.
I mean it's not anchorage they're like.
In the middle of nowhere quickly did you.
Just imply that anchorage isn't.
Beautiful no i mean nice is it no it's.
Wonderful it's a beautiful point where.
The show where the shows took place is.
Not in like the city they make it seem.
Like it's in the middle of like the.
Woods oh it is in the middle i think.
Yeah cuz like literally there's only i.
Think 500,000 people like half a million.
People in the whole state and just to.
Give you like like comparison like um.
Alaska is two times it's like two to.
Three times bigger than texas 2 to 3.
Yeah i mean huge it is but then that's.
Not a lot of people that's not like you.
How well you said anchorage is like.
Encourage is about like i'll probably.
Say like 300,000 people it's still more.
Than my island less than his island.
Million oahu whoa like waipahu pearl.
Harbor area yeah dang they scrap out.
There right a little bit a lot of.
Filipinos out there yeah what are you.
Trying to say but i was on the richer's.
What does that mean for those you don't.
Know scrap this is another word for.
Fighting yeah i just know there's a lot.
Of wives here i know what you like scrap.
Brah i think i just know yeah you just.
Know man have you been in a scrap in.
Your life once really i mean i can't.
Even say it was a scrap cause it was one.
And done now i'm saying you were the guy.
That guy.
Oh no no but no yeah you knocked the guy.
Out no i didn't knock him out it was it.
Felt really bad too.
I'd like so um this guy was making fun.
Of me i was like probably third or.
Fourth grade for third or fourth grade.
Nah yeah i don't scratch since but uh.
Faucets but i remember like he's making.
Fun of me and also heal yourself.
Stop stop bla bla bla stop and then i.
Just punched him in the stomach like.
Really hard and it was actually really.
My timing was really good because we.
Were all leaving the class to go outside.
I punched really hard right before we.
Got out so no one was looking like it.
Was already out he was just like crying.
And what happened trouble no no he was.
Using g yo shout out shout out to the.
Homie i'm not gonna put your name down.
Yeah similar story oh yeah i think i.
Already sat in the park can i sit on.
This party said it in your book i don't.
Know about yeah well you just beaten up.
People no i mean it's uh so i was in.
Kindergarten okay right.
This is my scrap this is my i actually.
Have to use the misogynist yes i was.
Thinking and you know you like everybody.
Lines up for you know to go to like the.
Lunch or whatever i don't we used to do.
That we would line up and it was always.
Like the goal to make it to the front of.
The line okay where i sat and you can't.
Run cuz the teacher you just everybody.
Walks really fast like that but like you.
Know how kids when they're trying to try.
To not run that was me but i could never.
Get there i could never get to the front.
Because where i was sitting i was like.
Towards the back of the class i have to.
Go around desks so the people on the.
Other side their backs facing the door.
They turn around and they're already.
There but this one time i remember i got.
To the very front very frontal line.
Hyped i'm the reason why i remembered.
This is cuz it was a big deal back then.
I finally got to the front of line and.
This girl cut in front of me she did us.
She'd literally just saw me there did a.
Side step and came in front of me and i.
Didn't say anything.
Tuchus i stood before her turn around.
And sock during her stomach and she just.
Collapsed and once she did one of those.
Like where she was on the ground.
Couldn't breathe and then i got sent to.
The principal's office.
Yeah it was a girl some of my stories.
Were say just less use she cut dude no.
What did yo that's that's not going well.
I didn't know what if she liked you.
Though maybe play she was flirting.
That's not how you flirt with.
Kindergarten ryan like you know do you.
Like do you know this girl i remember.
Her i have it i did not on like a video.
I was like sorry hannah.
Well i mean i think it's like i was in.
Kindergarten yes so much trouble for.
That already have you so mad you know i.
Was i was a i was a that was a jerk move.
But she shouldn't have cut anyway that.
Wasn't a proper response didn't.
Understand the time don't mind that i.
Got yota for my parents - i feel you.
Yeah and then the second time i ever got.
Into a kind of a fight was in fourth or.
Fifth grade it was an after-school.
Program and i brought for like a show.
And i brought a b and it was in like a.
Jar oh my god thing and it has like you.
Know obviously as whole dozen stuff with.
It so i caught a b i thought was the.
Coolest thing i brought it took it to.
The after-school program and this kid.
Tried to take it he tried to take my b.
So he called john like he was like just.
I guess he was just looking at it but he.
Took it with him out of my cubby hole.
And he had it with him and i caught him.
I was like what are you doing i took it.
Back put it in my cubby hole and the.
Heat we kind of got into like a scuffle.
I don't know he was just like trying to.
See it and this is like for the fifth.
Graders i did like four years of judo.
Already so i just grabbed he's just.
Waiting for this moment and i tossed him.
On his head yeah but i mean this is just.
Natural reaction like we were having.
Like a little little wrestling thing.
Going on it's what you were trained for.
For years.
Yeah it was natural i can wait for the i.
Just it don't take my b and don't cut.
That's the key did the b go unscathed.
The b was fine it was good yeah but i um.
Might've been a wasp actually i don't.
Know oh wow i don't i don't remember um.
But yeah i got in trouble for that too.
So more no no i haven't yeah those two.
Times but both times it was a.
Reactionary response i wasn't pushing.
People down and i used to get bullied so.
Okay.
Maybe that's doesn't maybe i deserve to.
Get like punched a girl and then and.
This guy anyway that's enough of my.
Fighting stories fighting story i knew i.
Would never beat up somebody i know i.
Couldn't win a fight so i'll just tease.
People and run that's why i'm fast oh.
Man you are pretty fast yeah i always.
Hear like hawaiians always be fighting.
Well my barber my barber was telling me.
He hella stressed.
No he shiva showed me videos nobody.
Thing is it's almost like it's almost.
Like a respect it's not always like yeah.
Yeah yes are like okay we have problems.
That's fine you guys like if we're not.
Gonna pull a gun stab each other go talk.
Either we yeah we yeah this talk it's.
Almost like a kind of like a normal.
Thing and then after you guys most times.
Like it's more um no matter who wins.
You're supposed to shake hands yeah and.
Call it yeah like there shouldn't be.
Nothing else after that.
Yeah and that and it works that's that's.
Good though it's better than like you.
Know someone pulling out a knife and.
Stabbing someone or and then that person.
Retaliates know that with their family.
And it kind of works i mean it's not.
Most civilized thing but it's about.
Respect and i liked it yeah and that's.
Why youtubers are boxing now they're.
Trying to respect each other you know.
What's funny but they get the bag for it.
Those that is true you know what's funny.
Though before that became a real big.
Thing i always said like man these guys.
Are at the time they were just doing.
Dish trash sounds like they should just.
Like they really hate her that much just.
Flight display i didn't say bah i mean.
Before there was an ounce i was like i.
Mean i talked about this i don't want to.
Do a show if i was like you guys should.
Just fight and then make up like just.
That's the best way to do it like you're.
Hawaii style just just fight it out and.
Then you know who has no matter who wins.
You just hug and then that's it call it.
That my super funny that's all.
Presidents and dictators instead of wars.
Yeah we just.
We'd be electing it on a different i.
Donald trump versus kim also kim what.
Car - i mean he's way younger yeah like.
In a fight you had a fight fight oh he.
Does have like he has like.
What is it when you're around his little.
Teaser god he's small but he's also way.
Younger than donald trump oh god trump.
From what i hear it's very unhealthy.
Yeah i can't imagine he has any car do.
Something about his hair makes me feel.
Like he he can scrap like you know he.
Can't fight yeah i don't think so either.
I think he's holding on like you see his.
Hair like he doesn't have you should.
Just get like he's fighting for his hair.
He's so orange to everyone there was.
Celebrity deathmatch i love that show.
I know don't know about that don't know.
About it yes larry used to be a.
Claymation just way too we're way too um.
I think tv is way too soft not to do.
That no no yeah just like you do damn.
Youtube damn they took they don't listen.
To this and i mean if we're talking.
About youtube in something like.
Comparisons from the past all now yeah.
Youtube is great and thank you youtube.
For everything you guys but i guess you.
Guys were in this group called ytf which.
Was like probably one of the first if.
Not the first super group on youtube.
Well super take that why is it super.
Well we were one of the mean before this.
Is before like all the team tens and.
Like the there was austere because there.
Are things right now right yeah we were.
So we didn't they but they became.
Businesses like they treated it like.
You're literally just friend you just.
We're friends and then eventually we.
Made a business out of it in a way kinda.
Yeah but we were just friends who were.
Hanging out and we think it was that.
Wanted to do more stuff to hang no yeah.
It was an excuse for us to hang out we.
Were just friends.
And we came out with this thing whitey.
Af yesterday today forever and we had a.
Message to spread and we basically just.
Made it because we wanted to hang out.
Want to tour together and yeah we.
Weren't we yeah we should like hiding in.
Videos and bullet yesterday today.
Forever that's the name that a lot of.
You would knew yeah but i guess a more.
Subtle name that it was which was what.
Did you guys call we could talk about.
That i mean i don't think it matters i.
Want to know cuz then the way that it.
Sounded the original name which is i.
Want you guys to say cuz i don't know.
We're just gonna keep it a secret.
No so originally originally before when.
It was just us talking.
It was literally a bunch of guys in a.
Room right and we were just hanging out.
And we were like - we're like well this.
Is like a youtube fret and that's what.
How it started yf initially started that.
Way and they started talking about.
Getting all these letterman jackets and.
It was like i was the one thing i was.
Opposed i know you guys wanted a but i.
Didn't want to let him in check it.
Anyway you know oh wow this kind of.
Popped in my head.
What it's kind of misogynistic that you.
Wanted youtube fret we didn't know what.
I didn't did you choose for you to fret.
The name because like you know punching.
Girls when he was actually i came up.
With the alternative to white.
Because i thought it wasn't gonna.
Exclude girls from what is she a part of.
This you wanted people to have run the.
Ytf mystery egg but it was just like.
Well at the time anymore.
We had more girl followers and guys know.
It's the opposite.
Oh really um yeah youtube in general is.
Just more than okay um but yeah we.
Switched it to you know yesterday today.
Forever which essentially it was just.
The message that we were trying to get.
Across right is yesterday is in the past.
Today you have a choice forever is up to.
You same thing is it's kind of the last.
Two things they're kind of saying the.
Same thing but essentially just meaning.
Like the message one to spread was what.
We believed in is is just making a.
Choice to do something yeah.
Despite your past you know whatever.
Happened don't let your past.
Circumstances yeah just do it.
That's basically the nike it's our own.
Thing who's that it was the same same.
Idea but in our in our way that's how ii.
Doesn't we told it and then that's what.
It became and from there i i guess you.
Guys went on to do a lot of pretty cool.
Things oh.
What was your guys personal like.
Favorite ytf moment favorite day yeah.
And then i kind of want to ask them like.
Dirty questions yeah.
Our favorite moment you first no i'm.
Trying to think i'm trying to think yeah.
Favorite moment.
Laughter.
Jokes and nobody gets so long joke long.
Dude i i mean the first tour was pretty.
Fun.
Oh wait the hawaii one no i was no.
Hawaii was awesome other than the fact.
That i got my heart broken in hawaii but.
What my girlfriend at the time i found.
Out in hawaii yeah.
Okay thanks remember this hawaii yes for.
Sure best time like does i really that.
Was just a really good like bonding time.
Yeah it was a great we got our own day.
Yeah yeah yeah we don't have to go to my.
Thing why didn't i mean if you don't.
Want to we don't have to but i do.
Basically okay remember that day we.
Actually were doing a photo shoot yes.
The first day and then the day before we.
Actually were celebrating dom and.
Dietrich's and andrews birthday yes the.
Dinner so that night i had like a really.
Bad feeling in my gut and i was like cuz.
My girl went out my girlfriend at the.
Time went out that night.
But then just don't see ya and then she.
Yeah i just felt like you know you got a.
Just gut feeling yep had a gut feeling.
Oh but then for most part i'm like just.
Worried about her well-being cuz i know.
She was going now she's drink above abla.
Long story short.
Woke up that morning got on the phone.
With her found out that she and then we.
Had to do that photo shoot i kind of.
Briefly yeah you remember and then i.
Kind of went downstairs in the lobby and.
Nelson house up to everybody and then i.
Just couldn't hold it in so i went back.
Upstairs and i started like laughing.
Hysterically laughing like crying and.
Like i was like i just like was like.
Shocked i can't believe this and then.
Went back down and we did a photo shoot.
Okay well i don't remember that okay so.
Hawaii wasn't that fun no no that was.
For sure that was my best time well it.
Was fun.
Just wait why despite that yeah oh that.
Is why i am that is why i.
On stage during uh i forgot one of the.
Songs that i did save this i had a song.
Called see this yeah and i choked up.
During during the performance and a.
Project man this song is so deep yeah it.
Was really that moment wow cuz i.
Remember writing that song not about a.
Specific person but then after the.
Moment after applied it applied and i.
Was like damn that correct okay so when.
You do write songs it's not always.
Necessarily there is it's always.
Inspired by love obviously so a lot of a.
Lot of it is just different aspects but.
Sometimes it'll be personal and then.
Other times it'll be i'll know enough.
From someone's perspective to write on.
It or it intrigues me enough where i'll.
Be able to be like how would i how would.
I react in this situation or right.
That's interesting yeah yeah but go away.
Well i guess that would make sense.
Though i mean i think some of the best.
Music for whatever reason maybe it's.
Just my personality like i really like.
Really sad oh tragedy alright great.
Heart horrible music don't tell them.
Just like just hurt me it's like damn.
Yeah i'm just like no but then you get.
Inspiration yeah you get it i'm like.
That too.
You just on a writing drought it's just.
Like i need to get i need to get my.
Heart broken just dating people just so.
He can make good meal yo taylor swift.
Does that i think yeah that's what i.
Think too.
Taylor swift it loses its allure swift.
Conspiracies she dates people only to.
Get her heart broken so that she can.
Write good music wow.
Now we're on to you yeah we're on to you.
T on to i feel like that's goodness with.
A common thing that people assume for a.
While okay that's good to know now your.
Favorite moment no hawaii yeah yeah okay.
You know you can't take mine that's true.
I mean what else was there all i know is.
The last where we did was exhausting it.
Was super exhausting i got the grant.
Love yeah.
Ciao - well we had people who kind of.
Organized.
To save us money essentially were like.
How much it was six shows yeah and try.
To be the most cost effective.
Yeah we've been very because we didn't.
You know we're trying to save money.
There's a lot of us we got to put.
Everyone up in a hotel we gotta book the.
Venues we're all doing it on our own we.
Also needed like maybachs and like.
Mercedes anyway it it was that was a.
Tough tour cuz we were we didn't sleep i.
Got like well yeah really but he was.
Getting sick we didn't we would like.
Arrived in a city perform you know in.
The morning early in the morning we.
Would you uh leave that night sometime.
Yeah we would do the rehearsal thing go.
To a hotel or something for like two.
Hours hired thinking of it i know and.
Then we come back do the show do a.
Meeting greet it be like almost midnight.
If there was an event we have to go to.
The event after and the flight was like.
A few hours after that so there was no.
Hotel really it was just like that for.
Like two weeks straight that's everybody.
Was mad and grouchy every everyone was.
And that was that was the last tour we.
Did i was thinking i don't want to ever.
Do a tour again not just with you know.
Why jeff just in general i was just like.
After that experience is that i wouldn't.
Say that's when ytf ended but it was it.
Was a catalyst i think yeah i had to.
Hurt i feel that yeah i like the jackets.
Though she was like to try like all the.
Judges jackets were so expense i never.
Wore it except for all the black and.
Golden's were a little bit better all.
The black those red ones though imagine.
If we got all of them together and sold.
It as a package five bucks for those who.
Don't know why tf was a group that we.
Started right like i was saying a bunch.
Of guys it will consisted of me and.
Junior d-trix kevjumba chester c for.

Not that we didn't allow girls in it was.
Just at the time when we formed it.
That's what who was around it's very.
Casual this guy's all right i want to.
Ask one what was like one of the.
Craziest ytf stories you've never told.
But you feel like you know it's been a.
While it's been a while i think i can.
Let another we haven't told any real.
Stories but we never talked about.
Anything really.
Or individually or as a group you see.
Why tf story yeah like was there ever.
Like one night where just like 70.
Strippers came into like a hotel room.
Thing not from my experience they were.
All dudes either boring them oh yeah no.
I mean we just were tired but you know.
Exhausting that was yeah we never really.
Did anything crazy what well we're lame.
Honestly the most that we ever did was.
When they when everyone lived in north.
Hollywood and we just we literally just.
Hung out i just yeah we're in the rooms.
Playing video games or watching movies.
Yeah that's it no we're super boring.
Nice little pirate bread boy you go to.
Panera bread down the street that looks.
Like our exciting day like hey don't eat.
The greek food like that one spot oh.
Yeah.
Yo yo we're lame down no.not i hear it.
Back it what's kinda lame we didn't do.
What our tours i mean i think most the.
Time we were literally just doing video.
Like we really were just having fun.
Making videos yeah this literally like.
It's like how could for the most part.
We're literally just doing how what can.
We do to be creative and help each other.
To make.
Videos make whatever idea come true and.
A lot of stuff we didn't even put on.
Camera like a lot of freestyle stuff do.
Like we'd start we'd make each other.
Laugh so hard too much to date yet too.
Much laughing we had to stop it no i do.
Think though why cuz people always ask.
Why did why tfn and i think the catalyst.
To that was because of that tour and at.
The same time that's when kev he's.
Booked that cartoon network thing he was.
On like doing some cartoon network not a.
Show but he was like hosting or to.
Network a little bit and so he wasn't on.
That tour so already it became six.
People from seven yeah and you know not.
Saying that it's because of cab that's.
White anything bud but that is like i.
Think it's around that tour yeah it was.
Just too much it's a lot for one i just.
Didn't i was just a host like i didn't.
Like i think it i think i think it also.
Started when you when you start i think.
It was the when you start bringing.
Business and friendship into each other.
And not having the clear distinction.
Between the two we didn't start it as a.
Business yeah yeah there's no.
Infrastructure that were like a.
Communication exactly communication.
Number one for anything yeah.
Communication now people know weren't.
Talking no communication yeah we're just.
Seeing not talking all right well i mean.
That's pretty cool well crazy story i'd.
Literally don't have one it's fine if.
You don't have well the thing is there's.
Individual drama in the group that.
Happened at towards the end most of us.
Were all friends but i don't wanna i.
Don't know until they come on the show.
Oh can we thank you a whole ytf like.
Podcast episode now we don't got enough.

Back from the shi shi break back from.
The cc break yeah we're back from the cc.
The whole time we were like getting.
Ready to go again i felt inspired i know.
I liked it anyway we're back from the.
Shi shi break we oh before we go into.
That should we just use that as the.
Jingle no i don't mean we don't feel.
Music.
Obligatory get back into the future.
Version and there's like oh we changed.
Some notes that's how things work.
The main dialect is tagalog there's.
Another one though right there's a.
Lock-on oh that's like a lot of rounds a.
Lot of ones i think and this is ion yeah.
But yeah there's no there's like a lot.
My dad speaks six times so but there's.
Like other one is hundreds really.
Thousands that's just words no but it's.
Like different regions they have.
Different it's almost like yeah it's.
Like let's say like even in um like in.
America we have people from the midwest.
For most like acts those like slangs or.
Like it's almost like this it's like cuz.
Like in certain dialects they don't like.
Pronounce like certain letters and all.
That stuff i see it's just stuff like.
Little things like that and then just.
Even words like in a hole in pigeon we.
Don't pronounce ours at the end yeah.
Words like like mo yeah mo bettah which.
Is obama are better mo bamba.
It's almost like yeah he's a big song.
It's a song bamba has his own song yeah.
Oh sorry you can't do that song we're.
Gonna get copyrighted song he's like a.
Rookie.
Oh no second year i think that's really.
That bill okay so i believe i ran across.
A video where the guy was saying that he.
Name is jack would ya check was the.
Rapper was actually knows the guy he's.
Like yeah and yeah and then mobile was.
Like oh yeah put me in a song put me in.
A song and literally literally name the.
Whole song about damn and he slaps dude.
It is a bad you love it but i think huge.
Fan i like you the most.
There's a twitter video that i saw they.
Weren't viral and mobile now they drop.
He drop the n-bomb and in a couple of.
Times but this twitter video had like.
I'd say at least a hundred.
Oh i kid and it's all about the games no.
In well games too but in a jumping like.
A large trampoline gymnast area and.
They're playing that and all these.
Little kids are like singing along with.
The song and then wow yeah right is the.
N-word just like they're all like oh.
Yeah like seeing like the basketball.
Games and you see like college like you.
Know college games get intense and they.
Are saying it and i'm like people can do.
That i mean they're not supposed to what.
You're looking and you'd be like i'll be.
Like damn these guys don't care one of.
The college games the red isn't that.
Part was a bother to come up there's a.
Black guy filming that he filmed another.
Black guy in the crowd and the black i.
Was like i always thought like yeah i.
Mean you just stay away from it in.
General yeah but i mean i guess if it's.
Not in that context in a negative way.
It's they're literally they're not st.
They're not creating the word they're.
Just repeating yeah like what is it like.
Ya know i mean i feel like like what if.
You got a kanye west we we are not for.
We're for sure not the ones to decide.
Decide yes.
But cuz like at the i just avoided yeah.
Yeah cuz that end of the day we don't.
Have the yeah it's not us affecting yeah.
It's not our word yeah so like if if you.
Could avoid it just do it.
Uh-huh i think that's the thing i mean.
Every even i was even thought like even.
Black people not say it - because it's.
Like demeaning - especially then right.
Like i mean i i've seen both sides yeah.
Obviously where it's almost become a.
Part of the language but those there's.
Like between the black community are.
Already fight about that yeah x some.
People say you shouldn't say it and then.
I see because the argument is like that.
The argument is that like they took that.
Word which was negative and creative.
Right right at their own which was like.
A word of endearment amongst themselves.
That's why other cultures feel like they.
Can say it because it's like oh this is.
Not a negative thing but it stems from.
Something like that.
So i can see why people would sing yeah.
But it's also and i think it's also.
Coupled with when people say without.
Education being educated about the world.
And i think that's the main problem is.
Like why you don't even you don't.
Understand.
Yeah what comes with that you haven't.
Earned the right now and why don't we.
Never will you know what i mean cuz we.
Don't we don't have that we don't know.
The history we don't know we don't know.
What that actually means to be that it.
Also changes over time - yeah like like.
Even back in in especially in hawaii for.
Us like i said the fa g word on a video.
And i was like i didn't think anything.
Of it.
Yeah it didn't have the same meaning.
That it did now granted back then being.
Gay wasn't as popular i guess or x as.
Accepted but i didn't associate that.
With gay people i just thought like oh.
That meant something else like it's like.
Oh if you're feminine if you're acting.
Feminine i thought that's what i thought.
That's what it was i didn't know you.
Didn't know that the word itself had a.
Negative had i known what i know now.
Back then of course no better yeah but.
It's just how in over time and back then.
People didn't think much of it yeah.
Either like gay people didn't think much.
No so for me because i'm from hoya as.
Well and then like there are people who.
Are called ma who's which are kind of.
Like it's kind of like um.
Offensive isn't it no supposedly it.
Isn't least in the comments that from.
The other one but it's kind of like a.
Hawaiian word for that in a way but not.
As offensive and i used to get called.
The f-word by them so i was like hmm.
What is his word now so i didn't even.
Think it was like associated so much.
Like game stuff i just thought it was.
Like an insult i was like damn dude they.
Got me they're gonna call me that and i.
Guess it's not that bad but they got me.
Yeah so it's just it's weird how it um.
Things just change everything maybe.
There's a word we said today that when.
They watch this podcast ten years -.
Really then they said he went for a.
Gender joke he's seen as something we.
Gonna do you see mess of the week we.
Haven't done it i like that that was.
That's when we was it peace enos of the.
Week i thought you almost sarah penis.
You know that's the point.
Oh that's the thing okay we had issues.
Earlier with paco not recording when we.
Were talking anyway oh you know we you.
Know what we need to do before we forget.
Was last time we ran out of time let's.
Get into the twitter questions people.
Had some questions for junior questions.
Where can they follow through twitter.
What's up oh yeah at off the pill on.
Twitter and on instagram it's at off the.
Pill podcast alright because someone.
Took a or it's @jr aquino aqu ino or how.
Else would you say you i like when you.
Say my name.
A queen oh no you does not yeah yeah.
That's me i made that up for you you're.
Welcome to using beef the first question.
We have we.
A couple okay kyra arata.
What's one important lesson or thing.
Ryan learned from junior and vice versa.
One important so yes it something that.
You guys have learned from each other.
That you feel like you can really credit.
The other person oh for sure go ahead.
My thing with ryan it's it's literally.
Anything you put your mind to you can.
You can accomplish that's what i taught.
You.
Yeah i know i think it's not necessarily.
Teaching but you taught by example but.
Just doing stuff you have he embedded.
Into you yeah you already had the.
Mindset but yeah see someone do it yeah.
To see honor on a constant consistent.
Level and you that's what i mean that's.
That whenever i think of people that.
Have longevity and and someone that puts.
Their mind to something cuz if people.
Don't know if you were following ryan.
And you don't already know this anything.
Ryan wants to do he will end up doing.
And do it fairly well that's not.
Necessarily right whatever that's right.
Games whatever you're not allowed to but.
Yeah i think that i don't think that's.
The gotta be be in that one haha well i.
Mean why don't i think what you're.
Referring to because we have i mean you.
Have mentioned this before and what the.
Thing that you taught me for one is just.
A run is no just just in general about.
Music it's so like literally i knew.
Nothing like i don't know what a harmony.
I didn't know what harmony was you're.
The one who taught me that.
Oh you if you go just like two notes.
Above mmm the other note or was it two.
Notes it's something like that i was not.
Like that's what i would i would take.
All of that could i'm just like why does.
This sound a certain way and i never.
Understood why things sound that way and.
Then when i heard you and andrew singing.
Together you would explain to me that.
It's just.
Oh he sings this i sing this and it.
Sounds like this yeah yeah and it's like.
Two notes above harmonizes with the.
Whatever you're singing yeah i learned.
All this music stuff and i was so.
Interested down to like what runs were.
Obvious like how do you do that with.
Your voice when you're just singing.
Annoying it's like going up and down or.
Whatever do you run i can't do it you're.
Always doing dom literally do the same.
Now i haven't done it in so long.
Um yeah i mean that's that's because.
We're doing it so much that it became.
Easy to do who does fire huh in any way.
I like that what is the run that they do.
And then maybe he can i merely remember.
I don't remember either singer singer.
He's same sings he's trying to sing sing.
He sings sings yeah shout of td jakes.
Yeah get on the podcast well basically.
It just means because we were all around.
This goes back to why it's a freegan.
We're all around like dancers so people.
Were trying to learn dance moves we were.
On singers so we try to learn that me.
And kev we didn't do anything that was a.
Lie no but i mean in you guys were.
Singers right you andrew victor conti.
Singing and dance chester the singer dom.
Was a dancer victor was a dancer like.
When we did shows me and kev were just.
Like garbage we're just hopes like we.
Just like build time between the good.
Stuff dances and stuff and sketches yeah.
But we weren't dancers or singers like.
You had talent in itself yeah no but i.
Think what he's saying is that what he.
Does isn't widely accepted as an art.
Form exactly we could bring people to.
The seats but you guys were the.
Entertainment we filled the time in.
Between that our performance was.
Literally just hey nice to meet you it's.
So great to meet you good to meet you at.
The end for the show but i think it.
Speaks volumes to how how great you guys.
Are at what you do because they.
Literally wanted to see you guys too.
Most but it's like i mean if you watch.
Somebody a lot it was just a great it.
Was a great time to just like get some.
Fans and be like amen i sing oh wow.
A lot of people were shocked i think.
Like a lot like there's a bunch of.
People obviously who heard i already.
Knew who you guys were.
Yeah but then there's some people who.
Would come and be like holy crap this.
Guy can sing like these guys are real.
This is not like youtube performance.
This is like real performers yeah i mean.
You're youtubers but now they don't.
Didn't know that you guys were like i.
Don't really legit perform mean there's.
There's there is that um there is that.
Mindset of or that perception of like.
What a.
Youtuber is yeah and the the stand i.
Mean i think across the board even with.
Just like actors or whatever if you're.
On youtube you're kind of seemed like.
Below a mainstream yeah yeah and i mean.
To a certain degree especially back then.
It was justified i mean there was some.
Shows shows i won't even call them shows.
Yeah where it's just people it's.
Basically just a meeting great yeah yeah.
But we there was a you guys were.
Actually performing that's what you guys.
Did for a living we tried to have.
Production that i've tried we tried and.
Even our show i think like we at least.
We tried saw effort yeah.
But anyway that's something i would say.
Out the whole music thing which actually.
Made a big impact on my career cuz i.
Started doing like music videos and.
Stuff one of the first ones we did.
Together was i'm always horrors kill all.
The videos yeah hardcore was the first.
We did one with david and you.
I remember you we were filming that.
Video and and and you were on a boat we.
Need this footage like this was that one.
Of the first things i do with david.
Actually ever anyway next question we.
Went we went you have another one see.
Loremaster 666 or johnny x was a devil.
Yeah asked was there a defining moment.
Where you said this is it i want to.
Become a singer oh hmm cuz i'm sure.
During your career there there's.
Actually been different levels of like.
This is what i want to do and it was.
Like a grand idea and then now you're.
Like oh more specifically this is what i.
Want to do you know whether youtube.
Being popped off you're like oh i want.
To do this and now when you found out.
Cuz you talked a little bit off you're.
Telling him when he wanted to be ya know.
I want to hear well might actually know.
The it actually happened before all the.
Auditioning all that youtube's dug it.
Was i think i was 12 or 13 mmm and i saw.
This i saw the first season of american.
Idol and i was like kelly clarkson yeah.
Kelly clarkson's season and i would.
Literally wash it and i was like oh i.
Want to do that and then i was just a.
Matter of waiting yeah.
And i don't see i didn't teach you that.
You already did that before i may know.
What it was like but you know um but no.
Cuz you know seeing it on a level other.
Than just music and sign right right.
And a personal level i think that's yeah.
When you see someone that you admire and.
Respect so it's right yeah but for sure.
When i was like 12 or 13 and i saw that.
I was like oh man i want to do this and.
Then i guess moving on then so at what.
Point are you now where you're like this.
Is the type of singer that you want to.
Be you know there's like oh yeah yeah.
Yeah like genre wise and all that stuff.
Like what kind of music i want to like.
Write and all that yeah i think um i you.
Know i grew up on like r&b i listen to.
Everything but i'm like majority is like.
R&b pop kind of thing so but i also just.
Love i just like i write from personal.
Experience so it's a lot about love so.
Um i think once i picked up like once i.
Picked up a guitar i was like okay what.
What am i gonna write about i don't know.
How to write about like things i don't.
Know yeah so everything's pretty.
Heartfelt i guess i that's kind of.
That's the kind of music i write so.
You're mushy    love y'all shoutout.
Anchorage was good diamond high was good.
That's where you went i mean i had donna.
High link spangler kid oh use your your.
Voice in school to be cooler in school.
We had kids like that in our school who.
Could sing american idol i mean okay no.
I sang in school but i wasn't like the.
One um i didn't like use it to like you.
Were more popular than not though i.
Wouldn't i mean i i was the i was the.
Kind of kid in in high school where i.
Was like part of a bunch of groups like.
The guy that the floater yeah that's me.
Do ya i was like one of those one of.
Those guys i had my core group but then.
I was also like just jumping around hey.
Jocks and all that i wasn't allowed in.
Those emotions you beat up girl has.
Stuck to saying they just remember you.
From the.
Just that group then were you always in.
The front of the line forever like i.
Think kindergarten no i think anybody.
Just be sure you're not this guy do not.
Cut traffic same thing like roll your.
Window down real quick is it okay to.
Continue a little bit more on this yeah.
Go ahead i want to do a little deeper.
Okay so you talked about this outside.
Before okay how there was a moment about.
A year and a half ago yes where you.
Realized and i think is because of a.
Breakup yeah oh i i really needed to.
Decide what i want to do with my life.
Yeah i mean i'm more or less it was like.
Um it's not necessarily what i wanted to.
Do with my life but knowing what i need.
To do and assessing like my life at the.
Moment was like oh i mean yeah falling.
Off you have a hiatus like you know you.
Did not do anything and you're in this.
Position in your career right now.
Because you have not done the things.
That necessary to keep it going hmm.
And at that moment i was like okay you.
Know after the breakup okay i'm i after.
A long after a long relationship is like.
Five and a half years you know you kind.
Of become codependent at a point right.
Um so after the breakup i was like okay.
I don't know how to function by myself.
But then i was like i can either just.
Quit i remember there was a part of me.
Was like oh my god.
Till last night i actually thought about.
It for a little bit yeah for like a good.
Week and i was like no no so um that was.
The moment i was okay i could either do.
That or i can be here and just start.
Creating and start making music again.
Mm-hmm and from that moment on i haven't.
Looked back and it's been great so.
You're like i just saw recently you post.
About how you have like i forget what.
Number it was but like over a million.
Spotify was it plays or oh no yeah a.
Year like yeah because they always do.
Like a year wrap-up thing i think like.
Well it's crazy cuz i'm spotify.
Specifically it was like when i first.
Started that first year i think i maybe.
Only had 40,000 i had the stupid thing.
Where i didn't upload my music like it.
Literally has not been on spotify or.
Anything for the past 10 years wow yeah.
I was late.
You're dumb i missed all that bag i'm.
Biased joe all the bags but whatever you.
Can't.
Yesterday today the other day but yeah.
It was uh yeah i remember when i first.
Started the first year it's it's tripled.
Since the since the urine avco right um.
So it's been good i mean yeah and i.
Actually just recently put out an ep too.
So if y'all want to check out shameless.
Plug got out we started i was gonna ask.
You about that actually that's the way.
So and not just that ep in general cause.
It would name the ep it's your last the.
Fifth song on that there's five songs.
What we started what we started named it.
That i really like the one right before.
The the fourth one was the fourth one i.
Think that was either i think a great.
Escape.
No this is there that i think it's great.
Escape it sounds more familiar ah.
Well regardless you're not sexy i like.
That whatever the fourth one was i.
Remember being like oh this is all great.
Escape yeah then what we started and.
Then that's the name of your album and i.
Always wondered like why don't they just.
Put the best song name the best song.
After the album and put it first so.
Everybody knows like oh this is the one.
Everybody knows and now and i always.
Wondering like how do you decide on what.
The name yes and what's the name the.
Album is for one and then why do you put.
It last i guess last makes more sense.
But sometimes it's like in the middle of.
The album um well i can't well i mean.
For me specifically what we started.
Actually what we started was i wrote.
That like five years ago a long time.
Shout out to jessie barrera and jay bird.
They helped me put this project together.
And as far as like picking this the name.
Of the project i was just like if i felt.
Fitting what we started just seemed like.
Something that spoke to me where i was.
Like you know what where where i've been.
Going where i came from and where i'm.
Going to go and i.
Wanted to pay homage to that so what we.
Started kind of felt like that also this.
Project is kind of like a bunch of my.
Influences in one thing so like design.
Like the first opening track is like.
It's very different from yeah it's very.
It but it's also very like jt like.
Justin timberlake and sing very pop so.
That's something i love the group on.
That but then you also have great escape.
Which is very kind of like latin r&b and.
I also that reminds me of like early.
2000s r&b which is like um there's an.
Usher song that called how do i say that.
Super inspired that and then you have.
What we started the title track which is.
Kind of kind of like a drake feel the.
Way the beat the beat is um but yeah.
That's how i that's that's why i chose.
That as the title but as far as the.
Order um kind of just seeing how the.
Flow was oh it's really just a flow.
Crazy yeah i always wondered that.
Because a lot of times like every artist.
They like name their album something and.
It's not necessarily the one that's the.
Hit yeah yeah you know sometimes they.
Even name it and it's not even a song.
Yeah exactly yeah yeah for me yeah i.
Just did it as a flow thing cuz my thing.
I was like okay.
How do i want to capture someone's a.
Year i got it and then i put design in.
The front cuz like once that beat hit.
You're like okay alright well going get.
What do you follow on spotify oh you can.
You can add my song to a playlist you.
Can follow that's better something yeah.
Add it on to a playlist yeah and or buy.
It on itunes i'm sure there anything.
It's on all all streaming al digital.
Platform there you go if you haven't.
Heard jr. before he is one of the best.
Vocalists that i know personally no but.
I mean ryan i won't say that you you.
Guys haven't hung out in like a long.
Time like a couple of years or so and.
Then the one night you came back and.
We're all just chilling and then you.
Left after ryan was like damn i missed.
Jr's voice i sang for like a little bit.
I was like damn i used to get this all.
The time used to hang out all the other.
Place and i would hear him sing i took.
It for granted dude as i did took you.
For granted singers and stuff like you.
Like get so used to it and just like oh.
When you doing here for a long time when.
Here at live it's like wow this sounds.
Like a track hmm so like i mean i think.
If you haven't her.
Jay-ar before go check him out it you.
Would not i guess you kind of just heard.
Him singing this you should predicts it.
Do not base that the perfect.
Representation here are singing yes i.
Want to know this real quick though yeah.
You ever make love to your own music no.
That would be super awkward.
What yeah okay okay get it but but.
That's okay let's say a like you get in.
The mood y'all yes.
The moves getting set and then out of.
Nowhere you just say hi like no and it's.
Not coming from me that would be crazy.
Actually be more crazy or crazier you.
Actually singing kanye does that.
Wouldn't be surprised yeah he's like a.
Service that knew banging mia and they.
Came out do it yeah i can see it's just.
Like him do you like it she's like i.
Guess now no you know who's wild i bet.
