Hello i'm rob boss and thank you for.
Joining us today today we're gonna be.
Doing a painting tutorial in the style.
Of bob ross no affiliation not related.
But let's get started shall we so at the.
Bottom of your screen you're gonna be.
Seeing a bunch of the colors that we're.
Gonna be using but while you're looking.
At that we're gonna get started is using.
Some of this white paint and we're just.
Gonna go ahead and just coat this entire.
Painting with a bunch of white just.
Continue to paint the entire canvas same.
Color it already is see the reason why.
We do this is because when we're.
Actually painting it's gonna be a lot.
Easier to blend the colors i can't.
Actually tell where i've already painted.
Because it's the same color but what you.
Want to do is just just keep on going.
Keep on stroking up and down up and down.
Not left to right i don't think it'll.
Look skidmark right here know how that.
Happened but we'll just paint over the.
House see there's no real mistakes in.
Painting you just go ahead and paint.
Over it there's no mistakes just i i.
Like to call them the happy little.
Accidents kind of like a lot of you kids.
Out there we've got a little bit on my.
Black thing right there whoops that was.
A mistake as i say just on painting.
Should be a nice relaxing tutorial just.
Watch them nice smooth wisely oh love it.
Issues cut to that really colorful.
Screen with the bead thing well loosing.
A little bit of bristol's right here.
Know if that's a good sign or not you.
Want to just keep sweeping that bad boy.
Out.
Something wrong with a little hair and.
You're painting but you want to start.
With the blank canvas let's just get.
That that a little straggler in there.
Keep that hair on it it's not a really.
Moving but just like anything else it.
Takes time takes a lot of time.
I probably could be using another brush.
Or something to get that out maybe even.
My hands i can't i can't reach any of.
The tweezers or something is anyone ever.
Either is or something no okay we'll.
Just keep at it once i get this last.
Hair off there you go.
There you go thanks for watching.
I'm rob boss what i wanted to do first.
To get started is to start off with this.
Bloody coping health got a little bit of.
That blue color in there but we got.
Start off with this little bloody red.
Just want to get the tips of your brush.
Pull it down so it's a little bit.
Lighter okay so now that we have a nice.
Even layer on both sides of your brush.
Of this nice bloody red what you're.
Gonna do next is essentially paint a.
Bunch of x's because we want you know a.
Little bit of pink in our sky and.
Because we have red we painted the.
Canvas white in theory it should be pink.
So just give it a try shall we it's.
Pretty pink see which one does create.
These little x's this is gonna be in.
Your sky and you just really want to.
Make this x format go with a light touch.
A lot of x's a lot of x factor a lot of.
X go and give it to you that's not good.
Don't put that in please don't put that.
In and there we go all right so next.
Thing we want to do is continue our sky.
With a little bit of blue oh as you can.
See there's a some of this doodoo brown.
Is starting to go on my thumb i'm sure.
We all can relate to that so the next.
Thing we want to do like i was saying is.
Continue building our sky we're gonna go.
With a little bit this blue right here i.
Don't know where to mix this because i.
Used up all the space with the red but.
That's okay hopefully gets a little bit.
Lighter it's not we're just gonna have.
To go with this so we're gonna start at.
The top and paint the rest of our sky.
With more x's little x's like so.
Kind of painting the top handle of this.
Bezel but that's okay.
If the x's aren't don't seem to be.
Blending too well you might want to try.
Some other letters so maybe let's try.
Some wise lowercase wise it's pretty.
Much just mac's.
As you can see you can't tell what one.
Color starts and where another one.
Begins i can't see it also colorblind if.
You want to give the illusion of a happy.
Little cloud right here you're gonna.
Want to just kind of dab it in and.
Strokes a car okay that's that's not a.
Happy cloud it's a little angry but like.
I said you know what i said let's just.
Go and try and make make make this work.
A little bit just think really happy.
Thoughts and just spend it in now you.
Have nice little cloud as you can see.
Just blending in thanks for watching i'm.
Not boss let's put some water in there.
How you gonna really love water so you.
Want to start from the bottom and always.
Go left to right.
Start from the outside-in might have.
Gotten a little bit of black on the.
Brush another big whoops you want to be.
Very generous with your paint you can.
Have that nice dark look on the outside.
Just like my soul.
Always remember to pull from the outside.
In horizontal strokes only as you know.
The ocean or lego is horizontally.
There's no ocean that goes vertically.
And there is your ocean what we're gonna.
Do next is dark in all the corners even.
The bottom right here some at the top.
Want to really give it that that one.
Little filter thing on instagram.
The vinaigrette thing so you want to.
Keep darkening each corner it's okay if.
You're painting shakes a little like.
This i'm not sure why it's moving.
Sometimes your paintings just come to.
Life and if this one is definitely it's.
Time to look good and it is coming to.
Life but we need another little baby.
Thing let's go and do that and once you.
Finish off your corners this is for the.
Really fun part washing your brushes so.
You're gonna want to dip your brush into.
This water and paint thinner and you.
Don't want to spill it like i just did.
It so you can i really want to rinse it.
Out as you can see i put a little bit.
Too much paint.
And we might need a little bit more.
Water whoops.
And now that you have your relatively.
Clean brush what you're gonna do is.
Basically just blend everything in.
Starting from the lighter colors in.
Which is the pink area just blend it in.
And i pretty much do that pink let's.
Move on the next thing we're gonna want.
To do is just take a little bit more of.
That blue this time we're gonna mix in a.
Little bit of white oh no just a tad bit.
Lighter this is the real fun part here.
Watch here you're just gonna take the.
Corner and just dad and pull down just.
Creating that distant little trees in.
The back no i may not look like trees.
Yet but we'll get there.
Then you want to grab a clean brush and.
You kind of just one on dab it pull up.
Create that illusion of mist i don't.
Know what's next what we're gonna do is.
Add another layer of trees but a little.
Closer so you want to go a little bit.
Darker and we're gonna do the same thing.
Just a little closer and pull down.
Everybody likes trees that is your.
Second layer of trees and then we're.
Just gonna take our clean brush again.
And just do the same thing create that.
Illusion of mist i might have put a.
Little bit pinkish pain again common.
Mistake you're gonna want to pull up.
From the water you're gonna do a pull up.
That works kind of yep next thing we're.
Gonna do is get our little knife thing.
Right here and we're gonna just take a.
Little bit more of that blue black add.
Some red in there as well like soon why.
Not add some white while we're at it put.
Some white in that bad boy it makes this.
Bad layup totally up to you.
What you want to do this painting is.
Your world you have all the control but.
Really what you want to do is check bob.
Ross's tutoria to make sure you're doing.
It right so we're gonna do is give.
Ourselves some trees so what you wanna.
Do is just kind of dad making little.
Trees still in the distance might look.
Like a bunch of sticks for now but they.
Are trees don't be shy.
Every tree needs a friend chandler some.
Monica.
Austin rachael right here pheebs no.
Choice we don't need no joey's and those.
Are some pretty not detailed trees it's.
Gonna do is we're gonna take a little.
Bit of white it's nice too little need a.
Little trick i like to call creating.
That just get some white and you're just.
Gonna tap it in between the trees to.
Give it a little looser of a having no.
No trunks in there tree trunks just a.
Bit here and there don't need a lot fact.
You can barely see it a bit but i can.
Cuz i'm really close to it the next.
Thing you want to do is take your knife.
Just get a little bit of white re a.
Little bit on the edges here we are.
Gonna create a water line do these.
Little slices right here all the way.
Across just like rick ross i next we are.
Going to make another color get a little.
Bit of red in there a little bit of blue.
A bit of green really just mix in.
Whatever the hell you want to do.
Whatever makes you happy so you can see.
It's just another dark color being as.
Colorblind as i am they all look pretty.
Much the same this dude who is still on.
My thumb ain't nothing wrong with that.
Use your head.
This parts really scary but remember.
There are no mistakes they're just happy.
Acts happy just start right here i'm.
Gonna start them in a straight line down.
Here's my kids are really crazy what you.
Want to do is take the edge of your.
Brush your fan brush just do a little.
Dab right about here i'm gonna dab on.
This side and then back on this side.
Just a little bit wider and just.
Continue the pattern you're just gonna.
Because ease just gonna make as ease.
Back and forth back and forth.
Lots of z's lots of trees i'm sure.
There's some bees and here are my knees.
There's one tree and i'm just gonna make.
A couple more same technique make.
Disease make the seeds i'm sorry.
And the next thing we're gonna do now is.
It's a little bit of that same color we.
Made the tree out of with a little bit.
Of yellow you should make a nice bright.
Green color and what we're gonna do with.
This green is go back in here and just.
Put some highlights just make sure all.
Your trees can equal a lot of love he's.
Just as happy as his neighbor.
You know i ever want to have angry.
Neighbors trees are no different so.
We're gonna take some of this white mix.
It into that try not to get this blue.
Mix into that same green just take this.
Lighter green color and just pop in some.
Indication of a little bush down here.
And it should be floating on a nice.
Little yellow yellowish green submarine.
And that's its island and since we have.
Our island now what we're gonna do is.
Create a little bit of dirt so finally.
We're gonna use my do to brown thumb and.
We're gonna mix it with the remaining.
White that we have here.
All right what we're gonna be doing next.
Is creating gigantic trees in the.
Foreground and this could pretty much.
Ruin your painting even mr. ross says.
That this is a bravery test so we're.
Just gonna just try it we're just gonna.
Go ahead and try it because we're not.
Afraid this is our world we can do.
Whatever we want in our world even mess.
It up so let's go for you gonna take the.
Edge of your brush and just start.
Dabbing at there's some green on there.
That was an act that was some happy.
Mistake hold on just cover over that dab.
In a way until you in what you have make.
Some bushes down here why not everybody.
Loves a good bush use a little bit more.
Pink but i am kind of lazy to make it.
Again it's really up to you guys to.
Decide how many bush how big your bushes.
It's always on as your own personal.
Decision you decide your bush just just.
End or in the middle or you can just.
Keep your bush going all the way.
Basically just paint in the corner of.
Black um so what we're gonna do is just.
Draw a little trunk straight in there.
Let me just check one more time what he.
Did.
Music.
Shh i got scared and i stopped pressing.
Down because it was so wide but you know.
That's why it doesn't look good.
Never paint with fear let's try this.
Again remember to make the sound is very.
Important and that's very thick that was.
Not intentional.
No mistakes though shh shh.
So not the best line in the world but.
We'll see all right so i think i put a.
Little too much pain so i'm gonna try.
And just just scrape a little bit off.
Scrape a little bit all make it a little.
Lighter oh i mean oh okay that's that's.
A little less so then we're just gonna.
Take more of this green that we had.
Earlier and you're just gonna take the.
Corner and just kind of dab i mean don't.
Be afraid just dab in some leaves.
Music.
Now it's time to get that's right even.
Crazier what we're gonna do more trees.
And even riskier than before cuz we're.
Going big okay you know what why not.
Let's make another tree let's go right.
Here let's go a little curvy but this.
One not everybody's completely strained.
If you know what i mean just like that.
And we're just gonna just do a little.
Sarees we're not even making z's anymore.
So you doesn't even matter don't you.
Start getting a little bored of painting.
You just start messing around kind of.
Give up a little bit but it's okay next.
We are going to take some of that green.
That we made earlier and just add a.
Little bit more yellow just make a.
Bright yellow color and just paint out.
Our individual bushes wherever you want.
It to be you know there was a bush here.
Did you and that's supposed to be a bush.
You know what let's make some rocks so.
What we're gonna do is take some of the.
Brown little bit of the white what's.
Really gonna give it some color is some.
Black they add a bit of black very.
Lightly just drawing some indication.
That there's some rocks right here and.
Then we're gonna go back to our.
Construction green dark chocolate brown.
Nice little path right here.
Nice big skid mark would have in a.
Lighter color i light your skid mark.
Give it some flavor just make a few more.
Bushes and just keep making your bushes.
Until you are satisfied and we're.
Basically just gonna make some sticks.
With the dark brown from earlier these.
Little details are what really makes it.
Just some more sticky i guess huh.
This pointers tired another way you can.
Add some sticks to your painting you.
Actually just take a clean knife and.
You're just gonna carve through it and.
Just pretty much keep scratching up your.
Whole painting everything you work so.
Hard to do just scratch it another.
Technique you could use just get like a.
Cat and or dog and just let them run.
Loose and after adding all your.
Scratches pretty much the last thing to.
Do is to sign it one of the hardest.
Parts of cursive is the b so we're just.
Gonna make a squiggly line because no.
One really reads this do they and there.
You have it.
Something.
Look at this how are you die am i done.
I'm sick of this man that was irritating.
So mad hate this piece of slow ass want.
To be all relaxed jim be real dude being.
Real you know tough clean.
Laughter.
