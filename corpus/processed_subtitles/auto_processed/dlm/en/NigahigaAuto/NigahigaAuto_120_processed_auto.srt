About doing youtube and mind you at this.
Point i just finally made like six six.
Figures from dancing so much there ain't.
Nothing atop that right i was like i.
Love this like this this is something i.
Think i could do and he's like you.
Should do youtube and i was like that's.
Something i don't think i would want to.
Do you know cuz your boy is making some.
Money and he goes is that the real.
Reason why i was like what's a big part.
Of it like you know i'm able to make my.
Op dance he goes alright what i'm gonna.
Do is i'm going to show you my month of.
December is 2009 his month of december.
He's like i'm not showing you this to.
Boast i'm showing you this because this.
Could be your future and i was like wow.
Why is your voice so deep and he's like.
And he's like here check it out and i.
Was like oh he showed me is it like 300.
Racks first 2009 he's only don't ever.
Say that to anybody.
That's true okay fine i was like 289 but.
But he was like he i was like oh uh.
Camp.
Let me get camera i started making.
Videos and i ended up instead just doing.
For the man i'm falling in love with the.
Craft and that's the story yeah you're.
Right i don't agree i don't remember any.
Of that.
I remember greg brought up like when.
You're asking about camera gear and he's.
Like telling you stuff is like why you.
Know is good camera gear for ya the.
Canon 7d he was big.
Yeah he was jealous because at the time.
It's like riot like whatever ryan said i.
Was like yes i will do it like you're.
You know the master you're teaching me.
And he was like you should get a camera.
I used this one so i just got a canon 17.
I didn't know how to turned on but uh.
You know greg was really envy of that.
Cuz he wanted a camera that was his.
Dream it was his dream.
Gregg the guy with the moustache one who.
Edits for us he that was his dream.
Camera and couldn't afford it and then.
You come in with no experience you buy.
His dream camera and that's why he was.
Salty yeah.
Jealousy party for one greg wow you made.
A lot of use with that camera.
You started youtube and you created like.
A huge channel oh yeah but big part of.
That's cuz of ryan he just would like.
The videos back then and then my channel.
Exploded and yeah thanks ryan you did.
Your own thing i mean you did your own.
Thing and you built your kind of built.
Your following but you also had that you.
Were still in the dance community like.
Heavily in the dance community and.
That's why you've got your tv show but.
Not your show but you judged on.
America's best dance crew yeah and i.
Remember when they brought me in they're.
Like oh we're bringing you in for a to.
Be judgement makers best dance crew.
Because like we feel like your digital.
Following is a huge you know outlet and.
I was like again that's because of right.
Ryan.
Brian's basically my jesus christ he.
Saved me and i bernie goetz smited my.
Career you're gonna get smited anyway.
What i find amazing what i find amazing.
Is that you know you're you're a dancer.
Right that's what you start off as and.
You're still known as a dancer you're.
Still in that community that you created.
Such a like a successful career centered.
Around dancing and that's something that.
There's so many dancers in the world.
That wish they were in your position it.
Can build what you've built for yourself.
Like what how did you do that like what.
Kind of mentality do you need to have or.
Work ethic to build a career off dancing.
Of all things uh it's a real question.
Isn't it yep i have low expectations.
Like i think i grew up at such like a.
Bot like a i got a low standard as far.
As like quality of life i don't know.
Everybody's perspective is different but.
Like i grew up not really having.
Anything and the idea of like like a job.
Of like a dream job at that time.
Probably something like a claims.
Adjuster or something something that.
Like is equal to like what my families.
Are doing just we grew up in a low.
Standard so i felt like because of that.
If i just keep like trying to surpass.
That then who knows what can happen so.
It's almost like i'm kind of climbing.
This ladder of like what the is.
Happening with my life and i'm just.
Still going just because i didn't expect.
To get this when you say sorry sorry to.
Interrupt you but when you say low.
Standard what is it that you didn't grow.
Up with money or you just didn't have.
Standards so the truth comes out all.
Right david you just just trying to get.
Into the trunk dig deeper gashi alright.
So i was born in sacramento california.
Alright and my mom grew up in my mom at.
The time was on welfare well thanks dave.
And she was like you know paper subway's.
Characters i never established this bond.
Feeling the holy spirit so let me speak.
Mofo go so anyway so anyway i think like.
To be honest yeah my mom did grow up.
Like we just grew up strict on funds and.
I was just like the we just didn't have.
A lot and i just felt like dance was one.
Of the one things that i think any.
Especially a b-boy at that time like we.
Just got all types of hate from you know.
Everything cuz there was no literally.
Like overall way to make money off of.
Breaking and then they came off the show.
Called so you think and danced in 2005.
And then like literally just taking that.
Opportunity and essentially just always.
Showing up to opportunities even if i.
Felt like i wasn't ready i think was the.
One thing that helped develop everything.
I have you know that and ryan higa see.
That i mean i do remember telling you to.
Do youtube and the reason was because of.
Your personality it wasn't i mean like.
Obviously people there's dancers right.
And dancers i mean you know the biggest.
You can get to a certain degree without.
Having you know branding behind it is.
Like a backup dancer to like a really.
Famous justin bieber or somebody right.
Well i don't know i may be teaching but.
You kind of went with that route you.
Went with your success with dancing but.
You used it to create dietrich's the.
Personality you know i mean and i think.
That.
Isn't that what you were trying to teach.
With your passionate project mmm.
Passionate yeah cuz it's more than just.
Okay become a great dancer right yeah i.
Think it's like overall what is the.
Question like i mean i think is it is it.
Just what was it was more of a question.
It was more of a statement of like why.
You are where you are is because you.
Didn't just follow the road of just.
Becoming a great dancer and then you.
Know teaching or becoming a backup.
Dancer like you you.
The reason why they picked you up is.
Because you built your personality yeah.
And i think overall it's like a big part.
Of it was growth i think i think i've.
Always been obsessed with this is like a.
Really answer but like since the very.
Beginning and to go to also answer you.
Ryan your statement which wasn't a.
Question but to kind of go back to just.
Answer both those things is i was.
Obsessed with growth of like learning.
About whatever i was doing or if i.
Started something new the growth of that.
And then what that just became i guess.
The more you grow you just are able to.
Offer more stuff to this world and then.
If you're decent enough people just pay.
You to do that's kind of the goal.
Yeah is it fair to say that you are.
Obsessed with becoming better at.
Whatever you try to do oh hell yeah just.
Because i thought i constantly think i.
Suck and i feel like it's just uh that's.
Part of anyway like i think any creative.
They just you know always i just feel.
Like i'm just obsessed with knowledge.
Knife like i just need to keep getting.
Better and you feel like that you did.
That with dance - i'm still doing it.
With that look at all these young cuz.
There's so many young kids online is my.
Father killing like these little.
Eight-year-old kids right i know when.
You see them what do you what do you.
Feel um.
Feelings for natal when you see these no.
Okay so like what do you how do you.
React so i i work with a lot of these.
Younger kids too especially like the.
Ones that are moving out of here because.
They're so dope on i i feel like the.
Beautiful thing about them is that they.
Haven't gone through enough life stuff.
To realize the restrictions and fears.
That life can teaches you to be afraid.
To fail you know i'm saying so they're.
Gonna learn how to they're gonna start.
Something see the standard at an early.
Age and then just go after that and then.
I.
For me it's inspiring i feel like it's.
Like it's really really dope to see.
These kids picking up stuff and being.
Freaking masters at it hella hella early.
And then and then you feel like.
You need to become better than them no.
Where are you go.
No because we were talking about how you.
Are obsessed with growth and when you.
See young kids who are surpassing your.
Skill sets or whatever yeah you wish you.
Had when you were that age not only they.
Surpass their skill sets over here david.
I still get i still get down so get down.
In my day when i watch you dad you're a.
Master you're a master of your craft.
There's not a lot of people in this.
World who can move like you that sounds.
Weird but like we do a replay of this.
We're talking and and like i'm just.
Wondering from you know your perspective.
As a master of your craft doing it for.
Like over a decade and have you know.
Your judge on shows like when you see it.
Like do you feel like a little bit of.
Competitiveness with these young kids.
Like not that you're gonna directly.
Compete with them but you know like for.
Me example as a musician when i see.
These young kids i'm like damn i wish i.
Was as good as them i still feel that.
Now you want to talk about it i guess.
For me not really just because uh for me.
I get excited about the the future of.
The generation if anything i always like.
To help out on the the that the.
Dancers don't know about like how to.
Monetize it on how to create a life.
Longevity lifestyle of it or if you're a.
Young kid a big part of it is you have.
All the movement and i'm pop i know you.
Can vouch for this - is these kids.
Haven't gone through enough like life.
Emotional to like really understand.
Why you're dancing yet does that meaning.
To the motion because you got to go.
Through some crazy to be able to.
Like express dance in a way that people.
Can translate it that don't understand.
Dance right so for me with dances i.
Always try to make dance secondary to.
Whatever i'm doing meaning like what is.
The message i'm trying to to say or what.
Is it that i can get the average person.
At home that doesn't care about dan's to.
Want to watch that or showcase that to.
Other people i don't.
About dance so with these young dancers.
It's like they have all the amazing.
Facilities and they'll destroy me at my.
Craft physically but when it comes to.
Emotion and be able to tell story that's.
What i would love to help out for them.
Because i feel like if i was that age.
And someone help me with that it should.
Be like you're able to like almost get.
It even faster does that make sense so.
It's like the why but so how do you.
Teach like you said they don't have the.
Experience how you teach someone like.
That well what do you do would he tell.
Them well i i said it was about like.
Experiencing emotional you gotta hurt.
Yeah yeah i just i beat the out of.
Them you spoke to both my ninja milk oh.
My god.
Emotionally ruining the moment oh my god.
There's so many cheap references no.
One's gonna get but what i'm saying is i.
Could kind of relate because in music.
You know dave's trying to speak.
Go for it go like you could tell if.
Someone's singing from a place of.
Experience versus something that they.
Just are just singing for example for.
Example you say to me you made that song.
Up right that's original.
Yeah so you guys if you guys want to.
Play that you're gonna have to pay me.
Royalties royalties well i mean really.
Nice attitude.
This is b you know this speaks to you're.
Funded really interesting your person is.
It your personality type though and i.
And i think i've told you about this too.
Is like and i think this is also what.
Makes you great is that you you do.
Always want to get better and that's why.
You got really good at dance and then.
You find something else that you really.
Want to be good at like singing like you.
Were trying to take you're never really.
Sang before but you've been taking like.
Classes for like eight months right oh.
Yeah yes yes yes i mean with everything.
You do if you get into something you get.
Obsessed i get obsessed for example like.
Our friendship right mmm i'm obsessed.
With bringing back what we had.
You know i feel like ryan i feel like.
Since the ytf days you know it wasn't it.
Wasn't it wasn't you know it was you.
Know but i feel like i want like our.
Planet it was turning into a beautiful.
Tree in the forest of great friendships.
And i feel like we was blossoming and.
Then like if you were the water and i.
Was the sun it's like i want to be a.
Better son for your water and i feel.
Like we can build our tree a friendship.
Again so with that being said i study a.
Lot about friendships and stuff and.
Wanting to grow those things and dom.
Doesn't drink.
He's never drank before in his life he.
Doesn't do drugs he's very clean have.
You ever done drugs before ryan.
Introduced me to adderall so yeah yeah.
So you just brought up ytf very quickly.
There's no punch to that phrase i'm.
Sorry what what did you have fun at ytf.
Like can you tell us about your.
Experiences i had a blast ytf i think we.
All did it in some certain point it just.
Ended kind of funky you know that i.
Don't know.
No i thought why can't was great i think.
It was like we had an awesome run and it.
Was like the first of its kind and again.
I got a praise ryan because essentially.
Ryan put his brand his own personal.
Brand aside for six friends i'm pretty.
Sure i like everybody did but i think.
Everybody did everybody did to an extent.
But the ryan was like the the one that.
Like literally birthed a lot of our kurt.
Our pushes and careers on youtube and.
Thanks man.
Well i mean kev already had a career you.
Guys had careers it's just we together.
It helped everyone including myself yeah.
Like that was like that was like what.
Are they called team ten before that.
Existed right i mean we didn't do that.
We had i thought people like did that.
Though to a certain degree like we lived.
In the same building the haunted.
Building where everybody lives now in.
North hollywood you thought i'm sorry i.
Never thought it was there's a couple.
Weird things dude there's weird.
In that building people who live there.
Or room you heard other stories i mean.
Our room and then kevin victor's room.
Why didn't kevin victor were haunting.
There oh well there's there's there's a.
Lot of people living there now but.
Anyway we kind of did that there's.
Certain degree i don't think there was.
Other groups before us no it would be.
Cool i thought it was dope yeah yeah i.
Thought it was the idea was there would.
You guys ever bring it back.
Whitey yeah that's not my i mean i've.
Been down uh right i don't even know.
What that means like oh why every means.
Yesterday today forever i mean like just.
Like what like touring i don't want to i.
Don't want a tour what if we made a show.
We could do a show i could do one you.
Don't have to do it but what if we made.
A show oh yeah was that the original.
Season why we've made whites yeah.
Yeah the whole goal was to that we.
Didn't have to do it later.
Like we don't have to keep doing these.
Shows cuz we're gonna get old eventually.
Yeah we didn't really do that we didn't.
Follow through so that was why tia did.
You guys what did you watch ytf parker.
Come here let's say nothing i'm letting.
You guys kind of just like talk and.
Everything you guys have a lot going on.
I don't want to interrupt the flow just.
Okay stop stop paco's pursuing a career.
In comedy so yeah stand up so he's right.
He's right no i've got good ones.
Let me read your nose i don't ever start.
With knock-knock okay i take that as a.
Challenge but dom you have an emmy you.
Want an emmy like you're you're one of.
The very few you just won an emmy award.
It's kind of like any award they kind of.
Just sit there and develop dust okay but.
Did you ever dream of even winning one.
Of these like did you actually see.
Yourself no no definitely not so yeah.
That was in 2016 that yeah question won.
An emmy in hail no like i've i don't.
Even think that we thought that was.
Possible when we were doing that show to.
Be completely honest so no i never.
Thought that that's crazy.
Where is it what do you do do you like.
Collecting yes yeah i don't know like i.
Don't know you guys feel about awards.
But i feel like awards are like the one.
Thing that it's like it doesn't matter.
How like basic or how amazing it is they.
All kind of do the same thing and click.
Dust i mean i maybe i was able to charge.
A little bit more for teaching but i.
Don't know yeah it's just a resume thing.
Right i guess that's the incredibly.
That's a real award yeah that's not like.
You're getting like some randoms like oh.
We feel bad for the asians and the.
Oscars that up so let's give these.
Asians dudes and award yeah but it's.
Still like people still think it's that.
It's still connected.
It's an emmy you know you're right i'm.
So much better than you guys you are in.
That respect for sure do people know.
You're asian you're happy people know.
Your fans know oh you know right yeah i.
Think so you're half filipino 68.7% - oh.
You took a test yeah and uh the one.
Where i did my own math and looking at.
My family um so uh yeah but i think it's.
About that but the rest is uh etiqa.
Etica is ryan's jokes can you tell us.
More about passionnate yeah so i started.
A company called passion 8 is that a.
Play on passionate oh my good.
You're pretty yeah it is thank you.
You're the first one ever point that out.
But i didn't i was just wondering no.
Because it might not have been yeah.
Passionate is basically uh passionate i.
Created a company to essentially help.
The next generation of dancers or any.
Dancers that feel like they want to get.
Like the level up of their careers not.
Just like physically but mentally so.
They can have the same type of outcome.
That i feel like i was lucky and.
Grateful enough to have that i didn't.
Expect i was gonna have so yeah get.
Passionate calm slash that's it i think.
It's the passion is calm just a slash.
I'm gonna talk about some of the recent.
Projects that you did cuz you're working.
With is it logan.
Oh bigger logistics we should roll clip.
Of that right now i don't and we're.
Barraged no let's use my video.
Right okay even then it's like someone.
Okay who is this person.
Oh dude who is this person oh my god you.
Know really i don't know so you know.
You're talking about earlier this kid.
That like changing the game and dance.
Like so she's like literally to me she's.
Well she's 16 now but i've noticed and.
She was started probably like nine or.
Something but we did this show called.
Roller roller dance season to last.
Season and she was on the team that that.
I was able to choreograph that one and.
Her name is logan she was on the lab and.
I was a girl.
Yeah logan's a girl b girl logistics is.
There be a people name and she's like.
Completely blown up like crazy over this.
Last year not just like industry wise.
But asked like like b girl wise and like.
All styles dance wise but what was your.
Question paco was just like what you've.
Been doing with project late because i.
Know that you guys just did a video.
Together right yeah we just did a video.
Who you are by oh that was her oh yeah.
That what you see it yeah oh yeah you.
Commented yeah thanks dude yeah thank.
You uh again a big part of it was.
Because it was her and i wrote the idea.
Down and i pitched it to her and i was.
Like this is not gonna happen unless.
It's you because when i was creating i.
Just kept picturing her and she was down.
To trust me that piece and boom i for me.
I think it's the best piece i've ever we.
I've ever got to create up and to date.
And again odd to say big part of it.
Because she is so amazing if you haven't.
Seen it then you can go check it out.
I know that was meaningful to you.
Because you're the one who introduced me.
To jessie j right oh really that song.
Yeah that's that specifically that song.
Before she became jessie j the the pop.
Artist she was yeah see - yeah we used.
To listen to that same song it was a.
Youtube video it wasn't even like she's.
On stage it wasn't even like a produce.
Thing and she was seeing who you are and.
Like you would listen to that over and.
Over and over to the point that i like.
Memorized it right so i knew that if.
You're gonna be something good you're.
Gonna what you memorize the song good.
Well i mean i memorize about knowing do.
It anything i would rather be the part.
Where she yells out big okay anyway we.
Were watching i knew it meant a lot to.
You because you never really did well.
You've done some stuff to it but you.
Never really had the fact that you were.
Gonna showcase.
Song it had to have meant a lot to you.
Yeah how you felt about it.
Yeah it's a beautiful song and the piece.
Was about i think like young girls that.
Struggle with what to post on instagram.
If like people do this all the time in.
General not just young girls but i feel.
Like young girls that i have heard about.
Especially from her like in the lab like.
That's big that people struggle with was.
Like as a young girl like what do i.
Produce that will maintain my like.
Self-love and like putting that at risk.
For the idea of getting more likes for.
More followers so i felt like if i was.
Able to tell a story that can help them.
With that i'll be able to change lives.
And logan made it came to life so yeah.
And i thought it'd be weird cuz i've.
Always want to do that piece but i feel.
Like if i play the young girl it would.
Be better and wouldn't wouldn't take.
Away from the song yeah and trixie was.
She was booked yeah okay well well.
That's your girl character yeah i don't.
Know yeah so you you're kind of on.
Hiatus right from posting youtube videos.
Yeah obviously you're doing a lot of.
Other things passionnate and then you're.
Judging so you think indents often do.
You shoot once a week.
Oh once a week once a week so it's not.
That i doing in between those being lazy.
No you're not lazy uh working on music.
Okay so you're doing stuff yeah but it's.
Just taking forever what does that mean.
Like suck it seems no i've been.
Working on music like the last almost.
Year now mm-hmm and because i i've.
Always wanted to a musical like a film.
Musicals that to you before so i figured.
I'd learn how to at least do basic.
So i can write it for not even me for.
Other people mhm.
But that's like a longevity dream you've.
Been taking lessons too vocal vocal.
Lessons right yeah cuz i went to uh this.
Guy i'm david choi once and i was like.
Yo david can't remember singing he's.
Like i don't do that i play piano i was.
Like you already say that no he didn't.
Oh i know you did go to him though yeah.
One point oh yeah.
Well we're actually supposed to work on.
More stuff together but that was again.
My fault i'm not ready yet.
David i want to be at your standard i'm.
Ready for you whenever you're ready.
I'm ready now i was waiting for the.
Punch timing right downtime hard time.
All right so you're working to music.
Yeah you're working on well obviously.
You're doing the show you're doing are.
You still doing passion 8 yeah we're.
Doing a next summer we'll end up being.
The next one we do okay we're gonna like.
Pry something on clinic then a clinic i.
Just thought of like a meeting or.
Something oh no i mean like a bath you.
Know basketball clinic you like going oh.
Yeah yeah for like a week and then do.
Something in yeah it's just uh it's like.
A weekend long thing and i think we're.
Gonna happen yeah yeah it's kind of cold.
Mmm cuz my day 3 everybody's weird yeah.
It's a good way to turn people off.
Though i'm gonna go in there no but i.
Kind of like it takes a while to find.
The right people that come and take the.
Experience too because a big part of it.
Is just like not just feel submitting.
But it's like having the right people.
That really want that because it's like.
We go and really deep as far as like the.
Dance ability itself the psychology the.
Business aspect of it and i think it's.
Just it's it's for everybody essentially.
Ever all types of dancers like any but.
More importantly like if people really.
Want to live off this craft and i think.
This is probably the best live off the.
Craft of dances the best uh i guess.
Clinic you can like you could take to.
Really have that outcome now and what.
Better place then to learn from a master.
Who's pioneered his own career you're so.
Sweet thank you man i guess you think.
That of me but i i don't really think.
That i'm still learning it's it's a fact.
Um always learning though oh yeah right.
That's kind of it like i mean gets to be.
A pioneer like you've mastered music but.
You're still learning about it right.
He's like no like god for a while yeah.
It's those are true words of a master.
Ryan you've mastered the art of comedy.
And youtube videos no i haven't really.
Yes really.
So there's the rest of us all say that.
Maybe 2005 to 2010 youtube comedy.
Specifically mm maybe i mastered that.
You've also mastered the art of being.
Humble that is an art well you know what.
We will be right back because.
I need to take a shishi break so that's.
P for all the people i don't know a just.
To remember and we're back gives any.
Brands for this this nope.
Okay this brand this episode this.
Episode of aw off the pill is brought to.

You some cases to the right address what.
Was the address again it's one two eight.
One two five four - oh five four.
You're making it harder on yourself.
Right now they're continuing 27 that's.
My social security number.
What if that is someone's real it.
Definitely is why they might be one of.
The first people ever like jesus's.
Cousin so we recently had bethenny on.
The podcast mota bethany mota you know.
What she's hot friend she's hot.
Yes she is a thirties she what she said.
I didn't watch them so as a storify you.
Guys met she's definitely yeah - because.
I didn't know she she's my better 23.
But so obviously because beth is you.
Know famous in her own right a lot of.
The questions are about beth oh come and.
Because obviously the other episode -.
Right we talked about you as well.
A lot of number remember what you.
Made for her on her birthday.
Of course you'd remember oh yeah.
The bedroom yeah the childhood room.
That's creepy.
It is now that we say it like this like.
If i were to show you guys the room it.
Wouldn't be.
As creepy there was a thoughtful idea.
Okay there's a reason for that.
This is your chance to explain your side.
Because we feel like in our relationship.
Where our best selves when we're coming.
From a place of playing and like having.
Like a fearless type of like attitude.
And state and we feel like that those.
Times were always when we were kids so.
We always try to maintain like a.
Childish like playful type of.
Relationship so i decided to make her.
Childhood room so if she ever felt like.
She needed to relive it or you know be.
In that state or if is that time of the.
Month she can go inside the room she can.
Go inside rule three she can go inside.
Of her room and just like okay i.
Remember what it was like my friend i.
Mean it was a good the thought was there.
Right yeah and i actually i'm very proud.
Of him i'm very proud of the guy still.
There yeah yeah it's at your house yeah.
It's at my place i just took one of the.
Rooms and made her her room and she she.
Still uses it for storage but it's i.
Yeah its storage it's actually like well.
Thought out though like when you showed.
Us to that room it was like wow there's.
A lot of thought put into this you did a.
Lot of research watch i you saw it yeah.
That's how i found out yeah oh yeah it's.
Really quick it took me a while it's.
Cool it was cool you had to like uh you.
Have to look for a tvvcr.
Two-in-one right they used to have that.
By the way for you guys watching this.
Not knowing these have tvs adviye.
Like a v8 like a vhs player mm-hmm a vcr.
And a dvd player and i had a fight and.
It took forever and i was like the one.
Thing i was like this is gonna be hard.
To get mm-hmm but yeah we found it.
Facebook marketplace do you guys ever.
Argue about little things about like do.
You guys ever argue or is it just yeah.
We're not jesus christ dating jesus.
Christ no i mean but you guys have.
Probably still argue what do you guys.
Disagree about like um well you know.
It's like a common one and maybe she'll.
Say something else but if i could common.
Thing we disagree about is how we're not.
Enough for the other person like you're.
Your own self yeah like we feel like oh.
Wow we argue over the idea that i'm not.
For her and then she argues over the day.
She's not enough for me we always want.
To be better for that person so as more.
Like an internal argument that's out.
Ternal it's almost healthy don't shoot i.
Mean it's better to have that that yeah.
Right oh yeah placing blame and like and.
I can do better.
Oh yeah yeah i used to place babe babe.
Babe.
Hashtag no well i used to place blame a.
Lot but i feel like that's why my past.
Relationships didn't work out you know.
Speaking of which ryan i feel like i.
Feel like we came to a place in our.
Relationship where i was blaming you a.
Lot for the paint and i realized it was.
Really just inside of me and i just want.
To say i'm so sorry callbacks write that.
Down i call back but whether or not it.
Stays in the video it's up to you but.
Just call back writing anything um but.
Yeah i think it's healthy to argue in.
Any relationship i think it's like it's.
Gonna happen but i think more.
Importantly to know how it goes after.
That and if you guys can grow from it is.
Where the importance is do you guys hang.
Out a lot yes every every day or every.
Day yeah are both busy people so yeah.
We're busy like singing and like but.
She's good i don't think is it because i.
Heard her sing yeah it's beautiful right.
It's just really good she's super good.
Yeah uh and then she'll be like i'm not.
Good not like and then you think like oh.
I suck i hurt you i'm really yeah.
So i'm like damn i must really suck cuz.
You don't think what did she say what.
Did she think about or what'd she say to.
You about your singing she usually does.
This and i think that means you she.
Likes it makes a face no like i think.
She's very supportive but i'm like i.
Mean i'm still new to it right mhm but i.
I think she's very supportive overall.
Just to listen to it all day it's.
Probably really annoying for it's like i.
Imagine if she was just practicing her.
Dancing she's like babe like oh you.
Be supportive wait hold on so as a.
Dancer when someone's practicing in.
Front of you and they're not very good.
Does that annoy you.
No oh i.
Actually the thing with me is like i.
Want to help the person i get better but.
I think that's what the problem is like.
We're singing i like i want her to help.
Me but she doesn't would you like her to.
I will babe how many learn how to sing.
Better did you ever ask her did help you.
Yeah oh yeah.
And what she usually say then.
Music.
I can do that i'd like my atd is bad uh.
Where did that go.
I usually ask her to help me but i think.
She's like always like she probably.
Started of hearing me she honestly just.
Feels like she's not good enough to help.
Me to be honest really yeah we.
Completely honest but i can listen to.
Her i got to get better what do you like.
Most about her i'm sure there are a lot.
Of things but yeah i was deep things.
Right away but i authentically move she.
Like inside her moral value i think i.
Was it brought me to her initially to is.
Like this her to amount of self-love.
That she had for herself i felt like oh.
Man that's cool that's like that's like.
A really cliche in deep but um i love.
The fact that she yeah i just turns me.
On that she that she's confident in.
Herself yeah yeah she has like not in a.
Boastful way but she just sounds like.
This like she wants to be a better.
Person constantly and i felt like with.
My past relationships i've liked in.
Relationships in general in order to be.
Best for that person you can't gotta be.
Your best self i almost like it to be.
Selfish to be selfless type of thing so.
That yeah i think i think that.
And she's bomb you see her oh look at.
Your boy get another the young the young.
But thank you baby it's great no i i.
Mean you obviously really really love.
Her and and when she was talking about.
You really loves you.
I see you guys is a great beautiful.
Couple.
Oh wow thanks i guess a question that i.
Have since you know you came up from.
Hard times and and at where you are now.
Maybe you can give advice to you know.
Your past self or even like other kids.
Who are in this area that aren't maybe.
Able to get into passionate and they.
Just you know they're looking for like.
Advice from somebody who's made it out.
Of hard times oh yeah my past self i'd.
Probably say continue.
A little bit of gingivitis.
Self-deprecation write that down don't.
Touch my paper yeah and i think to the.
Just the person out there that feels.
Like it's kind of like really really.
Tough which i believe it's it's tough.
For everybody is just different types of.
How tough is i think the ability to play.
And look at everything as an opportunity.
Instead of an obligation really helps a.
Lot i think with that growth and if you.
Become obsessive about something like a.
Craft and it takes you away from like.
Whatever pain could be i keep investing.
In that and then also be okay with a.
Pain you know because i fly gets the key.
Ingredient to be able to to heal it to.
Be to be honest so i feel like if i had.
Background music it would help a lot.
More sorry this is all we have hey y'all.
These guys are down well i'm here to let.
You guys know that the only great thing.
About down is that you know what up is.
Alright because without down there is no.
Up its life was just always about up.
There never be down and you would never.
Understand that up it's just it's just.
Up there you have nothing to judge it on.
So you got to thank the downs especially.
If you're thanking us now make sure your.
Thumbs up this video characters you you.
Believe they're like losing is important.
Oh hell yeah for me at least i don't.
Know i mean i'm all you guys have done.
Great things in your life in your.
Careers for me i've been i thought the.
One thing that's made my whole life.
Possible is the idea of losing and.
Failing so without it again i don't.
Think you would really understand what.
The other side is it's kind of like.
Heaven right they describe heaven as.
This place of like perfection and then.
You really think about perfect and if.
This this world was perfect how would.
You know what it is without having the.
Opposite right so there's like a beauty.
To the not being perfect cuz everything.
Was perfect then inhale it be perfectly.
Dark.
So then he's like oh i don't know how to.
Judge it so i'm just there right so it's.
Kind of like that i just look at.
Everything is like oh the beauty behind.
The up is or one thing is the opposite.
Of it because you would never know what.
That is.
Deep hashtag deep do you believe there.
Is a heaven.
I believe this is heaven especially.
Sitting with three angels that's right.
Even you paco or an angel write that.
Down.
I'm sorry no it'll be good.
Awesome.
You're giving him a mall right now use.
All of it yeah you want to get into.
These already this is like weird for me.
Because i usually want to ask like you.
Guys questions go for it's karma do you.
Guys think there's a heaven do you think.
There's a heaven david i believe there's.
A heaven yeah yeah i believe in some i.
Mean form of it i believe in the.
Afterlife.
Oh yeah i do too i do too i agree you.
Too even some something i don't know.
What that's called but i think there's.
Something you're like agnostic yeah not.
Not what's the other one where you don't.
Know stick believes in if there's.
Something there's a being yeah i know.
Which one i would say agnostic what does.
The one not not atheist yeah so agnostic.
About you paco um i don't know man it's.
Weird.
He's a pastor's kid yeah oh you lost.
Your virginity early didn't you know at.
The age of 26 actually that's early for.
Me oh wow the our question for you then.
Was the expectation in standard at which.
Your childhood was was that like did you.
Feel like you always had to live up to.
Like what a pastor's son is supposed to.
Be uh in a way yeah actually learn more.
Of how to act well i'm staying away from.
You maybe you should go into some.
Twitter questions oh go for it that's a.
Good.
That's a good transition there's a fan.
You if z wayne says asks would you.
Rather know how you died or when you die.
And why neither i mean you don't want to.
Know no cuz i'm excited for the surprise.
But jordan oh you're dead but if i had.
To choose one oh wait wait i'm art is.
This the premise that i'm dead already.
Sure okay i'd rather know oh no when.
You're alive yeah like right now okay.
Would you rather know like right now how.
You die or when like you're gonna let's.
Say it's like i'm gonna die in three.
Months versus i'm going to die by a car.
Crash which if i had to choose one i.
Guess when yeah i think i would use that.
More mm-hmm cuz you could do stuff yeah.
What would you do depends on the time so.
If i would you still be judging say the.
Mean dance it depends do i make it that.
Long like give me a date and i'll take.
Three months left it's always do you.
Know subjective time yeah three months.
Left yeah i was on a lot of time i was.
Still judge mm-hmm and i would still.
Finish this podcast a we made it on the.
List honesty so sweet yeah okay i mean i.
I mean that's not really the question i.
Just kind of took you somewhere else but.
I mean that's interesting.
No that's what you guys do i don't want.
To know when for sure when right yeah.
It's more beneficial you can use that.
Yeah i would probably dude i don't know.
What i would want to do actually mmm it.
Depends on the time i feel like mm-hmm.
What feels like you're gonna die at 178.
You mike oh a long time yeah that's.
True okay oh shoot what would you do.
Close you do pao cashews what if i had.
Only what i would choose time as well.
Time yeah david i would choose time ya.
Know so we're all the same bore yeah hmm.
Mmm okay well on to the next question.
From uh betters unite i wonder i think.
She's our fan.
Do you and beth ever play pranks on each.
Other no but i feel like i feel like uh.
No we don't but maybe i want to start.
Now hmm i like you prank garden a lot.
You prank garden a lot no not really.
Like when you post up on your instagram.
We kind of like it's not really a prank.
Or she's kind of a dick yeah it's so.
Funny.
Mm-hmm so that's kind of like a prank.
Yeah i guess so but it's like she's she.
Knows about it yeah yeah oh he fakes.
Pranks frank it's not a prank.
It's just truth i'm a fake all right no.
No no next question cp valerie what's.
Your favorite and least favorite about.
Making choreography the favorite part.
Would probably just be able to produce a.
Message i've like a lot of people that.
Can help a lot of people oh shay but.
It's so real honest um let's see and the.
Worst part is probably like the.
Self-doubt maybe that comes with making.
Stuff like like especially if you're so.
Protective over like if you have a good.
Reason why and you're like you become.
Like a little bit like man asked me like.
Perfect and perfect so i don't have that.
As much anymore it feels like um but.
Yeah i would say those two things do you.
Feel like when you're creating.
Choreography for yourself versus other.
People do you feel more of that pressure.
On when you're performing it or when.
Someone else is performing it i feel.
More pressure if it's for me then i do.
For the other person because for me the.
Other person is actually a lot easier.
And i get to see it where like with me.
It's like i feel like i can't see myself.
Doing it and i already feel whack so.
Much like the pressures like for me.
Would be just a hire to make it because.
It's just like also my ability sucks.
It's gonna create around the what do you.
Mean like right now like i'm not just.
Good at dancing as i used to be as far.
As like what i can do not ladies.
Creating creating choreography yeah go.
Away that's in your head right uh yeah.
But it is for yourself it's like i feel.
Like i'm more limited on what i can say.
With my body worth other people.
Well usually people i choose it's like.
They have more to say and i can get the.
Message in my head that i want the world.
To know through their their uh their.
Bodies like ab yeah there's a lot larger.
Than yours yeah yeah yeah so um i guess.
This is a question that i have since.
We're talking about choreography and.
Kind of your art yeah i'll do here i'll.
Do your solos thank you um but also if.
You could only choose one.
I guess creative aspect and outlet what.
Would you pick because you're you're.
Actually so multi-talented you mean like.
It's annoying like crafts well you said.
You think you're into singing right now.
Yeah but then you i know but you you.
Dance and you pretty much like i mean.
Like you said you're always learning but.
You conquered it i mean you've hit the.
Tier right like i'm like the top tier of.
What a dancer could be like what's the.
Higher.
What's higher than what you've done.
Become the judge on the biggest dance.
Show.
There's something really higher than.
That right i don't know maybe all right.
I think so i mean well what i'm asking.
Is if you're at that tier right like the.
Highest here in my perspective it's.
Almost not as fun right because with.
Singing it's more interesting because.
There's so much new things to learn and.
I feel like you just like learning so i.
Guess went back to poc was question kind.
Of went off track um what is what would.
You pick i mean would it still be dance.
Oh uh if i had to choose right now.
Yeah it probably choreographing because.
I feel like if it was like one thing.
That i can help more people with it.
Would probably be choreographing pieces.
Then making music or making people laugh.
Does that make sense so cuz i feel like.
Right now the the choreographer i kind.
Of just fell into being a choreographer.
There's nothing that i really took.
Serious but i felt it i kind of to be.
Honest easy and i feel like because it's.
So easy it's not as fun because i want.
To feel struggle when i make stuff does.
That make does that make sense so.
Choreographing like i feel like i would.
Help more people out that way so i'd.
Probably coat that okay well oh that was.
A good answer yes that's great like you.
Need that struggle that sorry that you.
Don't feel like you've conquered it.
Because once you've conquered it then.
You're like i'm done yeah and i feel.
Like i mean there's still like a.
Struggle in creating and core.
But it's it's a lot i think it's because.
I've been around it so long i've been.
Doing it so long i mean it ryan's kind.
Of similar like probably like you know.
What you have to do and you know what.
You need to do and it's where is there.
Like growth in it or like at one point.
In time and again i think you can.
Constantly grow but you gotta want and.
Do that type of things so that's what i.
Love singing because you know when.
You're this bad then you can just have.
You just keep going wing and then you.
Know one day you won't be as bad that's.
Better.
Wasn't getting better it is better than.
What i remember yes it's a lot better i.
Have a question i'm so you know as a.
Dancer you need to be in shape you do.
You do you feel like dancers should.
Workout do yoga that type of stuff or is.
Dancing enough would you say yeah paco.
It's not like it used to be when we were.
Dancing like you'd be a little too lazy.
To eat the dancers now are crazy.
Man like they're i like running every.
Morning they're their diets are freaking.
Stern their training mind and body.
Learning from some of the greatest.
People all over the world and a big part.
Of it too is that they have the standard.
After their palm because of the phone.
But i would recommend that especially if.
You're like going for it now.
No like no matter what dance taught you.
Got to be like if every yeah i mean it's.
In the olympics now people are.
Definitely already big crazy break know.
There yet dance actually ballroom and.
Breaking b-boying and breaking is now in.
The olympics junior and adult divisions.
That's crazy right that's pretty crazy.
So ain't like week they can't have our.
Dyes that they use do you know the spam.
Musubi is in the tuna hotdogs for $2 20.
Cents a ampm ain't gonna work no more.
Like that unless you're b-boy morris but.
That is cut you know that's like in.
Every sport right like over the years.
Every sport they get better and better.
Like someone just broke some kid just.
Broke michael phelps his records right.
Yeah a bunch of his records and like kid.
Yes i'm cool or something yeah something.
Like that and then like you know compare.
Basketball now versus like 50 years ago.
Oh naz is like you're about to say oh.
Braun or michael jordan who is that okay.
Well that's i'm going even further but.
Like it's it's a whole nother level of.
Like athleticism sprinting you know.
People used to run marathons in like an.
Hour.
Like slower i don't know what the real.
I'm making that up yeah i know yeah like.
Over time people are getting better and.
Better at stuff and at what point i mean.
There's so there's the aspect that you.
Have to offer is that there's it's not.
Just physical right yeah in terms of.
Like i mean i think it's gonna like.
Improve what i ask is what we what david.
And i talked about with music of how.
Like david loves real quote unquote real.
Music you love you love like edm and.
Stuff like that too but like like.
There's a difference between like the.
Art of music and then the like formula.
Yeah like the formula basically so what.
Do you consider good i think psychology.
Is 80% and i think physical ability is.
Actually 20 so these so you're saying.
These kids have the physical yeah i.
Think a lot of kids and then like well.
Logistics is the one that's where it's.
Like she's very stern on growth of mind.
And i think any something be always.
Coming out right now is that there have.
A strong balance between mental growth.
On top of physical growth and i think.
With any craft you could tell the.
Difference when someone's like like.
Lebron james i i think it's like a big.
Part obviously to his physical but his.
Mind is like super like brilliant and.
He's able to take advantage of both.
Those things because i think also to.
Your body is secondary to your mind i.
Think your mind is the center point to.
Operating your body so i think just.
Taking advantage of your brain i think.
Was a huge part for me at least wife.
Like i have a lot of received a lot of.
Outcome for a lot of things that i felt.
Like i maybe didn't really deserve.
Compared the person that was physically.
What you used to say all the time like.
Oh i'm not the best breaker.
Not even close that's choreographer but.
You were smart enough to combine the two.
And use it and use your personality to.
Create the success you have yeah yeah.
Yeah yeah you're aware of that that's.
What you did right yeah i guess that's.
Yeah yeah i think the mind is very very.
Important um again i don't know how you.
Feel david but to while you're on that.
Subject do you feel like if some.
Not in a good mental state or maybe they.
Just broke up with someone do you feel.
Like when they dance it's different than.
If they were in a happy relationship uh.
It's definitely be different it's just.
Whether or not other people will enjoy.
It or if they'll enjoy it but i do.
Believe it it is different i also.
Believe that that type of pain used.
