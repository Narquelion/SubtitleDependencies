If you don't believe in god then you.
Will go to hell when you die based on.
Your science religion you don't have to.
Agree with other people but you.
Shouldn't be slamming them for not.
Believing in what you believe.
I think krisha is definitely on a bad.
Rep it has also been misrepresented joey.

Him he's a cool guy okay.
Anyway what what has been going on area.
51 that happened yes since we were back.
In vegas.
We didn't go actually raka raka went did.
You see that no he actually went out and.
He made it in the news like his pictures.
There with him dressed up with his face.
All painted and i think he was with that.
Girl that i don't know who he was with.
Someone i think it might have been that.
Riley real point porn girl riley yeah i.
Don't need disrespectful adult.
Entertainer yep yeah i think he was with.
Her i mean i don't know i could be wrong.
I could be just like saying the wrong.
Thing but how come you guys didn't go.
You guys live out here it's actually far.
From here isn't it i said alarm for it.
And it went off and i slept in on.
Accident so basically for those that.
Don't know nothing happened.
Really right yeah what he actually.
Stormed it right that's what i heard and.
Then i also heard that there was a.
Concert called alien fest that took.
Place there as well uh-huh i don't know.
Anyone that went and people that were.
Asking me or like yeah you live a year.
Ago and i thought they were joking and i.
Was like laughing and they're like no.
Are you gonna go it's like oh there's.
Million there was so many there was.
Millions of people signed up for it and.
I think like i don't know what the.
Numbers are maybe look up how much.
People actually went but it wasn't i saw.
A picture and there wasn't that many.
People well the cards good it was a.
Decent turnout but i mean nobody's.
Stormed it obviously it's a joke but i.
Thought there would be at least one or.
Two dummies that just rush maybe i'm.
Sure maybe there was mmm i hope not yeah.
It says here that there are only.
Hundreds of people the guardian says.
That 75 people were at the gate whoa.
That's it no there was more than that.
Right i don't know the guardian picture.
Of something else then according to the.
Guardian the gate is located on the.
Washboard dirt roads and is a rugged.
Journey but about 150 people managed to.
Get within selfie distance whoa one.
Person was arrested at the raid.
Also someone did do it and that charge.
Was for public urination so nobody.
Actually went in right right.
Damn do you guys believe in aliens.
Aliens i think that's different i mean.
If you believe it that they exist do you.
Believe they exist well i think so i.
Think it's kind of almost silly to not.
Think they exist have you ever seen one.
No i've never had any kind of experience.
Which is kind of interesting to think.
About because if i've never had a.
Personal experience usually that's what.
I judge like my opinions on things for.
But for aliens i think in terms of how.
Many numbers of universes there are.
Right it's kind of it would be nearly.
Impossible for me how do you define an.
Alien though like extra i think there's.
Some there's other things that we don't.
Know about if they count as aliens then.
Yeah like the ones that you see you know.
Like the the ones with the big eyes and.
The pointy 'f chan or whatever they.
Called the greys yeah the stereotypical.
Alien do you believe that those types of.
Beings may have existed or do exist so.
Any form of intelligent life that looks.
Kind of like what we yeah mainstream.
Media from outside of the earth yeah i.
Think it's very possible i mean i think.
A lot of people claim things from what.
They've seen well obviously we have.
Learned a lot from movies and stuff like.
That mm-hmm.
And again that could be coming from just.
Someone's imagination or it could be.
Coming from real accounts because it has.
Been real cosmic who knows if they're.
Telling the truth or not mm-hmm but i.
Think that if it's very possible that.
These aliens are just humans that.
Evolved to that point mmm and they're.
Actually like like i said i mean it i.
Like from the future right they're the.
Future versions of us essentially i mean.
This is this just one theory there's so.
Many yeah i don't know enough we should.
Have like a segment if we start talking.
About this stuff we all pull out tinfoil.
Hats the chocolate kiss on his head but.
Yet i think it's possible that's also.
Think it's possible that we are living.
In a simulation i mean you've heard that.
I've heard this before.
Because there's no weight i mean the.
Thing is there's with that theory.
There's no way you can say yes or no.
That it's true or not there's no way you.
Can tell that we know yeah and even if.
You did know well who cares what can you.
Do about it right you know there's.
Nothing if we are in a simulation right.
Now there's doesn't it doesn't matter.
Like it's nothing we can do about it.
Right yeah so what's like the.
Correlation between i mean there is a.
Correlation in some theories between.
Aliens and simulation theory right for.
The universe something some aliens and.
Simulation well i was thinking that i.
Mean this is i don't even know if i've.
Heard this theory i just thought mm-hmm.
About it that aliens essentially they're.
Higher levels of and i'm just seeing.
Aliens and abroad you know intelligent.
Being yeah there's some there's a.
There's a level that we don't understand.
A level of intelligence essentially that.
If they were at that level we wouldn't.
Be able to comprehend it anyway and.
That's like us being us like they.
Created it's a simulation and then we're.
In it right it's like like if we were to.
Turn on the sims and create a world for.
The sims.
Right and they're living in that little.
World they would never know we existed.
Controlling them right or it's like you.
Can't explain to an ant what a.
Automobile is right right you can't.
Explain math recently i don't know where.
I saw this but someone was talking about.
Describing different dimensions or yeah.
Third dimension of fourth to me i don't.
Know what it's called but it's an ant.
Like if it an ant or on a table and.
There was like an object on the table.
And you were to take it away it would.
Have just disappeared to the end but.
Really we just moved it under the table.
Or something like that i don't know what.
I'm talking about.
I'm just butchering that but yeah i.
Think i think it's possible but i think.
What i mean i'm gonna try to come at it.
From a different angle but i think an.
Ant in animals are very different to.
Come i find it tough to compare animals.
To human beings because you know animals.
Are instinctual like they they act on.
Instincts right you you throw a bone and.
They're gonna run after it right but.
Humans we have a soul i believe we have.
A soul and and i think that we have a.
Choice we have freewill to make a.
Decision like i can decide to slap you.
And i don't think that.
There's a i don't think we're i mean i.
Can i can entertain the thought of.
Having a living in a parallel universe.
But because we have this free will in a.
Choice to make and in emotions right.
Which can drive us in and move us in.
Different ways and we can also create.
That's what makes us different than.
Animals is we actually can create pieces.
Of art and different things i think.
We're much more intelligent beings.
Much more you know we have more more.
Depth and like you know i have a choice.
To like slap you right right now i could.
Throw something at you or whatever i.
Want to do but to say we're in a.
Parallel universe in and it's like the.
Sims where you know we would control.
This character but i don't think there's.
Something controlling the way that you.
Know like my decisions that i make how.
Do you know how do you know everything.
You just thought right now wasn't.
Controlled by some higher intelligence.
That's programming you or programmed you.
To essentially think this in this way i.
Think that i would like to see ides of.
Yeah what people believe yeah i mean.
Yeah for sure you can choose some people.
Believe you know i mean just to be to.
Clarify you're christian i'm a christian.
And i i believe we were created by a.
Create tour that you know in in in the.
Creator's image so the christians.
Believe that god is the creator of the.
Universe you know it's just the.
Beginning the beginning of time yep.
Right i mean there are christians that.
Do believe in the big bang right that.
Was the beginning of what happened i.
Mean christians you'd be stupid to not.
Believe in science right science is not.
The complete opposite of religion.
Science is in a way its own religion.
It's a yeah it's definitely theories.
There's theories and there's facts.
Within science but i think that you know.
I believe we were created because the.
Question that and you know iii if i'm.
Being honest i do struggle with it.
Sometimes in regards to were we really.
Created right and but i have to go back.
In time and nobody was ever there right.
You could have been a million years ago.
It could have been this is anybody argue.
About we're not argue about we talk.
About i'll talk about a lot because.
We're into this kind of stuff but you.
Know if you look at the big bang it's.
Basically to dust.
Particles coming at each other and then.
Hitting each other and then turning into.
Something but for two particles to move.
There needs to be a force right so if.
There's a force like whose builds that.
Momentum or that gives that push for.
That particle to even be there in the.
First week where that particle come from.
Is it energy like was the universe.
Always there like why why is there.
Energy moving you know there needs to be.
Something that pushes that so it's tough.
For me to believe that it so i always.
Have to question what came before that.
So you're saying you believe that.
There's something behind the curtain.
Even at the very beginning of where.
Science starts yeah yeah it's like if.
Though if you're saying if the particles.
That collided is that's the big bang.
Theory right yeah and that's what.
Created the universe universe universe.
Yeah what area was it in before that for.
One and then who created the particles.
We create the force right and what i'm.
Saying is and like you said there's no.
Way to really know for a fact yeah and i.
Think with scientists who there's the.
Whole point of science is doubt right.
Like they always doubt and they're.
Trying to learn more by doing.
Experiments and after x many times they.
Come up with a theory right of doing the.
Same thing over and over but they're.
Still always doubt so there's no exact.
Nobody has the exact 100% answer that's.
Always say there's no 100% right um but.
You're saying from your perspective that.
Well i mean you struggle with it because.
You're very logical yeah but what do you.
What are your thoughts on that then my.
Thought is that my lot like if i'm being.
Extremely logical or you're a very.
Christian person we can talk about that.
Tightly i think my because i'm also very.
Logical to and try to be as realistic as.
Possible i do think that i think that it.
Makes logical sense for me that there.
Was something whether it be a god of the.
Bible or god of whatever it was or some.
Sort of energy or you know whatever it.
Was i mean we could say that some people.
Could say that there were aliens before.
Us right that created earth but at the.
Same time it's like okay then where the.
Aliens come from was did they have their.
Own form of a big bang yeah but what i.
Mean what i mean is like i mean.
Essentially we're the whole simulation.
Thing we're talking about is.
Almost the same theory it's just we're.
Renaming it in a we're like masking it.
Because really the aliens are god in.
This scenario in the simulation you.
Created the simulation right right god.
Created the particles or whatever you're.
Trying to say right the big bang or.
Whatever i don't i don't know the i.
Don't know the bible well well enough to.
Compare it yeah but essentially is it in.
Your head possible that god is just an.
Alien or someone in the future or some.
Higher level of intelligence i think.
It's um rated this you know yes actually.
I think it's something worth discussing.
And like talking about yeah but isn't it.
In your in christianity yeah almost like.
Sinful to be thinking in that way no no.
God god didn't give us a brain to think.
Like in a box you know he i think when.
God was the creator like there are a set.
Of rules to live by that help govern.
Human beings because govern because.
Human beings by nature are sinful.
Creatures right like if we act on.
Instinct if i if i really acted on.
Instinct i would if someone cut me off.
On the street i'd want to punch them.
Right but but we have these rules and.
Regulations to govern us as human beings.
So that we can choose to make a good.
Decision choose to be a good person we.
Can choose to do these things but it's.
Ultimately the choice that we have so.
With that being said we're allowed to.
Think about these other things there are.
A lot of philosophers you know even you.
Know einstein questioned this a lot too.
Right so i think it's it's very powerful.
This this whole concept of free will.
That we can think whatever we want to.
Think we can behave however we want to.
Behave we can you know dream whatever we.
Want to dream we could debate whatever.
We want to debate and i think that's.
Healthy to either reaffirm your faith or.
If you don't if you don't believe if you.
Don't agree with some of the things then.
You know you can you can you can make.
That decision i think that's the freedom.
That is given within this this religion.
If it's if it is i mean i'm just at this.
Point kind of talked about some of this.
Stuff but.
Just for the sake of argument sure if if.
Based essentially if god created.
Everyone right and he knows everything.
About that person what they're gonna do.
In their future is that really free will.
Though if god you know how everybody.
Says oh gods this is god's path or well.
I don't know what they say some sayings.
Like that.
If god's created you yeah god's will.
Whether you made mistakes in your past.
And you corrected them like you're on.
This certain path that god created for.
You right god created that path is that.
Really free will because he's like in a.
Simulation if you compute and you put.
These certain you put in a code for this.
Character this character is gonna think.
Like this he's gonna believe in free.
Will.
He's gonna believe i'm gonna make these.
Mistakes i'm gonna learn from these.
Mistakes i'm gonna believe that god that.
God created this is that still.
Considered free well i don't know if.
That made sense.
Well actually i know you're asking and.
And i think it's a question that a lot.
Of you know people of many faiths think.
About and you know they could struggle.
With it or they'll have their own answer.
Or feel peace what do you think so what.
I think is for me you know this is this.
Is definitely something that i've i've.
Thought about and i am still on a.
Journey right - it's as of learning in.
And all that but i think the way that i.
See it is if we understood everything.
Every sort of abstract abstract concept.
Then we wouldn't be god i mean if we.
Sorry would be god it would be we would.
Be god if we understood every single.
Abstract concept right but because god.
Let's let's just say if god did exist.
Mm-hmm.
God would not be a great it wouldn't he.
Wouldn't be a god if he thought on our.
Level right if he thought in the way.
That we thought then yeah it does it.
Just doesn't make sense right he.
Wouldn't be a god god needs to be an.
All-powerful all-knowing all-loving and.
Cut so i mean like with that admitting.
That the admitting that we don't think.
On that level yeah how do we know that.
We got it right how do we know that so.
Essentially if we're nothing on that.
Level we don't.
We're just thinking in terms of what.
Humans know and what we've learned over.
Time from a book yep right and.
Essentially like we don't know for sure.
We don't but but what do we know that.
We're that how do christians know right.
So that's something called faith so i.
Think faith applies not only in.
Christianity but i think faith can apply.
In your lives just your daily lives.
Whether you're a christian or not right.
You have faith that when you drive from.
Home to the grocery store that that car.
Coming against you on the other side.
With just the line dividing you isn't.
Gonna turn in crash into you and kill.
You sure right you have faith that.
You're gonna get to that destination and.
I think in the same way you know.
Christians have to operate in that way.
Right i think like i said god gives you.
A choice you can follow you know and.
Learn more about me right mean like god.
God wants you to learn about him so.
That's why he gave us you know the word.
So you can read through it sorry i don't.
Mean to sound like i'm preaching though.
No i mean i think it's i think that's.
Why it's interesting because ya see your.
Perspective yeah so it's more like he.
Gives you the choice it's like you know.
God's not god doesn't like condemn.
People jesus doesn't condemn people but.
It's more like you make certain.
Decisions and there are consequences so.
For example i get he's a just scott so.
You know if i'm gonna live a life of.
Like killing people.
Obviously there's repercussions right.
Like not just human-made laws but just.
Like the universal law or whatever you.
Know the law that that you know if you.
If you operate within christianity then.
There's there's judgement right so if.
You kill people for a living that be a.
Murderer but or a assassin yeah but you.
Know if you go around and and and live.
That kind of life there are.
Repercussions right you go to jail you.
Don't like you your life will be ruined.
So um what god's saying if you live a.
Life of faith in you you take that step.
In learning about me and living the way.
That that i teach then you'll be in line.
With like what i want in your life right.
Now like you asked before if god knows.
What you're going to do next.
Yeah right is that free will does that i.
Mean for me personally i asked myself.
That i'm like no i think i have free.
Will because i can make decisions and.
And i can do whatever i want like like i.
Said like i can go out and treat someone.
Horribly or i can actually treat them.
Nice so i have that choice but i think.
It's you don't have that choice though.
Because it's not like god's moving me.
Like a puppet no break what i'm saying.
Is with that theory yeah you just said.
You had that choice but you're gonna.
Choose to be nice right because that's.
What you believe in your brain is right.
Yeah.
And god made you that way yeah right so.
Isn't he really just controlling so if.
He made you that way and you think that.
Way and you've chose to do the right.
Thing all the people that god made that.
Chose to do the bad thing he created.
Them to so why would he essentially if.
This is if everybody's on god's path why.
Would god create these other paths i.
Don't think everybody is on god's path i.
Think everyone has a choice to live.
Along you know what what god teaches.
Versus making a decision to say i know.
How do you know this how do you know.
That that's do you i mean do you know i.
Don't but i own that's my feeling are.
The other do you feel you have a choice.
Well what i feel is that i think i.
Personally think that the bible i mean i.
Don't think i've always wondered like i.
Yeah the bible itself is where you're.
Learning everything that you're talking.
About right now correct sure that's.
Where all of christianity we're just.
Christianity not all religion correct.
All of christianity on the one i'm most.
Familiar with and i've been to church a.
Few times but i don't really know it and.
Grow up in it all of christianity's.
Everything you know pastors everything.
They know and so on comes from this book.
And the book like you said is not.
Written by god right god didn't write it.
Guidance did himself did not write it.
But he humans did pointed yeah but you.
Know how did you learn that you learned.
That from the bible something that.
Humans wrote so all that information.
Everything that you know about god.
Everything even the creation of the.
Bible is from other humans it's not from.
God himself he didn't even in the bible.
It says to go i didn't write the god god.
Inspired.
So that's what christians actly what i'm.
Saying so if humans aren't smart enough.
Just like ants not like if humans aren't.
Smart enough to think on god's level how.
Do we know that the bible got it right.
Completely maybe it's close absolutely.
Not know i and i don't know all of the.
Answers but i can give you like my take.
On what i've kind of learned and it's.
That first off there are a lot of.
Scholars the brightest minds atheists.
And non a theists who study the bible.
And look into in really deeply.
Understand it because it's such a.
Fascinating book just historically.
Historically a lot of these artifacts.
That are in the bible there's they're.
Digging up and it matches exactly where.
It is in the bible so so factually it's.
Accurate compared to some other you know.
What things what things are matching up.
What do you mean like you know an.
Example like you know just artifacts or.
Effects of like you know different like.
Clay pots and things like that that that.
Were invented during a certain time.
Period it matches along with the by i.
Can't be like super accurate fit but i.
I've like looked into it but i think.
It's it says something that there are.
You know very highly intelligent people.
Who who go to you know dedicate their.
Entire lives and learning about this.
This book right this historical book and.
It's it's i think at least factually for.
Me that that is something that's pretty.
Interesting as a logical person right.
It's like oh why would if this was a.
Bogus book why are there so many.
Scholars studying this and in teaching.
It and continuously you know digging.
Things up in learning about it so that's.
Number one.
Well on that you know if that's one.
Reason to believe that this has some.
Validity to it yeah then what do you.
Think about other religions and all that.
There's tons of people believe in.
Buddhism who believe in every other.
Every other religion even scientology.
Why do you think if so many people.
Believe in that not that that's like a.
Minor example but yeah and we all know.
That's i mean but that's my point it's.
Like.
Yeah just because a lot of people.
Believe in it doesn't mean that you know.
Just like science right if that's.
Considered if we consider that a.
Religion and sure or a belief huh why.
Does somebody believe in it because.
They're taught it from a very young age.
So it becomes fact it's not a belief.
It's fact.
Yeah and they show you instances just.
Like in the bible there's things that.
Match up they show you instances with.
With experiments and say like oh this is.
What gravity is and this is because this.
Has been explained and it we can prove.
It right in the bible it's kind of like.
The same thing maybe not as many proofs.
But we also grew up in a grew up in a.
Society that teaches you science is fact.
Right and some people grew up in.
Christianity like yourself and that's.
Fact for you as well.
But you know what i'm saying what do you.
Think about other religions just because.
A lot of people believe in it doesn't.
Mean that it's necessarily you know i.
Mean for you i'ma be asking ya know for.
Sure i my my whole stance on this is.
Like everyone is free to believe in.
Whatever they want i don't mean to make.
That sound like a cop-out answer but you.
Know i'm still figuring out christianity.
I don't claim to know everything but the.
More that i do dive into it the more.
That i do feel that more connected to it.
And i do think that it it becomes more.
More real to me and it makes more sense.
The deeper i go into it so that's it.
Into each their own right like i don't.
Want judge someone because they they are.
A different religion you know or whether.
There be islam or buddhists or whatever.
Right or catholic like i think everyone.
Whatever makes them feel the way they.
You know it brings peace into their.
Lives then yeah you know what do it as.
Long as you're not hurting people right.
You can believe in whatever you want and.
I really believe in the freedom thing.
Like i think you have a choice everybody.
Has a choice but it's which choice are.
You gonna make right it applies to.
Everything in life whether it's religion.
Or your job or your education or how you.
Decide to treat people so i think that's.
Like the most important thing for me.
Well just for the record - i'm not.
Trying to say.
I'm anti you're really an time you see.
Things that i think about yeah and i've.
Always been afraid i talk to this with.
Jeremy for a long time jeremy jeremy lin.
Yeah super christian and i've talked to.
You know he's even asked his pastors and.
Stuff and there's always it always comes.
Back down to you just have to have faith.
Which there's nothing wrong with that.
But i mean i think it goes to show that.
There's no hundred percent and i think.
It's it's good for people be open-minded.
Enough to admit that like even even like.
Scientists i think you shouldn't say.
There's no way.
Christiana like even if it's point zero.
Zero zero zero zero one percent that.
Christianity our god is real right - in.
Atheists there's no 100% cuz you don't.
Know we're not on that level even if you.
Believe in science and your aliens.
There's no way that we would know yeah.
Absolutely i i totally agree with you i.
Don't think anything is a hundred.
Percent but you know there are people.
Who will say that and believe so.
Strongly in their own religions and in.
Science right yeah i don't think that's.
Helpful yeah i think people should be.
Open-minded in and learn about other you.
Know thoughts and beliefs before you.
Know casting any sort of judgement and i.
Think you know something like your.
Spiritual walk whatever it may be.
Whichever religion that's a very.
Personal thing and i think even like.
Talking about it right now i'm sure.
There's no z on traverse it's gonna be.
Controversy me hate agree so that's like.
That's what that's why we're having this.
You know conversation so i mean i.
Obviously know your beliefs right and.
You're more confident yours and i i'm.
Still i'm still learning myself agnostic.
Yeah that's not agnostic as you believe.
In something yeah but you're not exactly.
Sure not sure what yeah yeah i mean the.
Closest thing would be christianity.
Because you know might have my family's.
Buddhist house christian but i've only.
Been to like church it you know cuz i'm.
Arden and you and i've only been to you.
Know christian churches but i don't.
Really i i just don't know you know and.
That's why i ask because i'm curious.
Yeah it's it's fascinating like the.
Deeper you get into it i mean you listen.
To some of the people who make.
Case for creation creation there's.
There's creationist scientists and.
There's like non creationist scientists.
And that it's pretty interesting to kind.
Of see how they discuss things and you.
Know there are christian scientists say.
Our earth is like ten thousand years old.
Or something.
I i don't really know i'm not a.
Scientist so i can't even verify any of.
That but whether i don't believe it's.
True.
I feel like it the earth is a little.
Older than that but some of them make a.
Case and they debate it amongst other.
Scientists they you know they talk about.
Carbon dating and how the traditional.
Way of carbon dating is actually.
Inaccurate some people argue that and.
Then some people i don't know i can't i.
Can't even comment on i don't know what.
I'm talking about the science part.
Because let's see what the reason is.
Because and i think why it's become such.
A i don't know i people have become so.
Arrogant about it i feel like more.
People more and more obviously just i.
Feel like christianity is still huge.
Obviously right but it was bigger when.
We were younger for some reason i just.
Feel like more people now say okay.
Science is fact cuz we grew up with that.
Right and a lot of people don't.
Necessarily i don't know maybe i'm wrong.
I i think the majority or for science.
Now as opposed to like twenty years ago.
When we were growing up i actually feel.
Like it's growing you think so yeah at.
Least from my perspective maybe it's in.
Your groups do you think that has to do.
With the progress of science maybe maybe.
Or like people who are becoming famous.
Aren't just like you know back in our.
Day growing up it was like every athlete.
Thanks god everyone gives credit to god.
Now it's like no degrasse tyson and joe.
Rogan and like people who have alternate.
Alternate theories that aren't just.
Christian based right even like saying.
The pledge of allegiance and people.
Having an issue with that it's like that.
It's just a different time nobody would.
Ever come out 20 years ago and be like.
My son or daughter does not have to say.
To god in the pledge of allegiance right.
Yeah.
But now that's an issue i i also think.
That today in today's time like within.
The past you know a few years or.
Whatever i think christian has.
Definitely gotten a bad rep and it has.
Also been misrepresented and i think the.
People who comment on.
The religion itself are commenting about.
The people the minority the the people.
Who are in in you know power in churches.
And whatnot and the leaders but the.
Religion itself if you actually research.
It it's like with anything right like.
People can hear about like rumors about.
You but if they don't really know you as.
A person right.
They won't truly understand where you.
Come from in in it's like the media the.
Media paints a certain types of type of.
Picture and i think a lot of people have.
Done that to christianity but mostly you.
Know the christians i know they're not.
They're not like that it's it's just.
Like a you know in every religion in.
Every belief system there's always you.
Know bad people in it and there's also a.
Lot of good people so it's it's with any.
Anything like i think it's like i said.
It's a personal thing so if one is.
Interested they should dive deep and.
Learn more as much as they can on their.
Own and i think this is something that a.
Christian would say is just research and.
Read the bible and then for yourself.
And then just see what what happens you.
Know like and then maybe you'll.
Experience something maybe you'll feel.
Something and in maybe that's something.
That we can hold on to i guess and see.
Where that goes i don't know like to.
Each their own but it's i think.
Christianity has definitely gotten a bad.
Bad rep definitely in recent times.
Especially with like you know gay people.
And the rise of like equal rights and.
Stuff like that it's i mean it's.
Associated with it i feel like it's kind.
Of chilled out a little bit yeah but it.
Was pretty bad to be like it was like.
Almost like a negative thing to be.
Christian for a little bit yeah at least.
On social media it maybe he's just in my.
Circle yeah you know like christianity.
If you go deep into it it's it's all.
About love like god is love like and i.
Know that sounds hokey pokey but like.
It's it that is the message so i think.
If if people actually look into it and.
Really dive dive into it like they'll.
That's what they'll learn not but not.
From what everybody else is saying.
Here's the here's the other thing.
Other question i have for you i don't.
Know in the bible is it wrong to doubt.
Christianity and is it wrong to think.
And believe in other religions because i.
Heard that it is um like i said god.
Gives you the choice yeah and will you.
Go to hell if you die believing in.
Another religion or if you die doubting.
There's a god man according to the bible.
You gotta ask me this tough question i.
Know a controversial question no but i.
Mean like no i'm asking you specific.
Yeah yeah be personal come on the by.
Bashar it you've learned from your.
Pastors your own reading yeah do you.
Believe that the bible is saying.
Christianity is saying if you don't.
Believe in our religion or if you don't.
If you don't believe in god then you.
Will go to hell when you die the short.
Answer is that the in christianity if.
You do not believe that jesus christ is.
Your creator and and is the messiah the.
One who died for your sins then yes.
You'll not go to heaven at all jannetty.
Right.
That's what krishna teachers now if.
You're asking about my beliefs that is.
Definitely something that i struggle.
With something that i think about a lot.
If i'm being really honest and i think.
It's not just me i think a lot of.
Christians thinking that way i would say.
Most probably thinking that way and.
They've they've thought about this sort.
Of thing and struggled with in their own.
Mind right and i like to think about.
Both sides like you know there are those.
Who are very firm like if you're not a.
Christian you're gonna go to hell right.
Yeah and and that's one way of.
Expressing that with what they've.
Learned the other is more like like me.
In the middle like i don't know i just.
Don't know right if i can would an all.
Loving god send people to hell right or.
Allow people to make a decision that's.
That's what i'm saying a good decision.
To go to hell freeze those people that.
Went to hell too yeah so and like the.
Other lot like side of me if i if i play.
Devil's f do p if god is a just god.
Right is there such thing as can you can.
You feel love without hate can you feel.
It can you hate without love right.
It's maybe that sort of thing maybe like.
Those are like the ideas that i think.
About in my head yeah or the concepts.
That really confuse me to be honest but.
I'd really i can't answer that it's hard.
Because yeah it sounds evil for me to.
Answer it that way that's what i'm.
Saying though like and that's that's why.
I bring it up yeah because these are.
Things that i think a lot of people.
Question yeah and like i said it doesn't.
Doesn't go anywhere that's why i'm.
Perfectly fine with anyone believe me.
Into anything but the people that.
Believe so hardcore and one thing right.
Like that's the people that i think need.
To be a little bit more open-minded i.
Mean i'm not telling you absolutely to.
Not believe in what you believe because.
Everyone has that right and i'm just i.
Don't think you should get scrutiny i'm.
Defending myself i think you should be.
Scrutinized for questioning those things.
I don't think there's anything in the.
Bible that you know i'm gonna get.
Screwed and so are you feel like being.
Christian i'm sorry guys i'm sorry for.
Everybody and then there's gonna be.
People like me who get all the.
Christians they're like oh my god he's.
So but that's a he's so anti-crime not.
Trying to disprove make you sound anti.
Anything i know but you know how people.
Twist words and stuff like that anyway i.
Just thought it was interesting and i.
Don't know we never talked about.
Religion i know it's a very it's super.
Contra not but we're just having a.
Discussion i don't think there's.
Anything wrong i've had this discussion.
With pastors and they don't maybe they.
Do hate me after i haven't talked to.
Them since but i think it's interesting.
Yeah to come from a perspective of.
Someone who's never been didn't grow up.
In the church essentially i don't know.
Well we did kind of left you out there i.
Don't know if you have anything to.
Contribute there which one from what.
Topic or what was it just like um i was.
Just letting you yes you're having like.
A really good back and forth now just.
Asking a lot of questions that i'd i.
Guess don't really have answers it would.
Be we should just bring on a pastor and.
A scientist on the shane show oh yeah.
They'll be amazing all right but we do.
Talk about this outside of the podcast.
We do and we have but not necessarily um.
In this much detail yeah i talked about.
It.
Yeah i don't know you're not very.
Religious are you wait what are you a.
Question.
What was it oh just your thoughts about.
Yeah what are you yeah yeah on the.
Entire subject yeah just in general this.
Kind of it's not really like a science.
Versus religion to be yeah it's just me.
Coming from i'm not even on one side i.
Just thought i don't know enough to know.
That's my that's where i'm coming from.
I mean without trying like without i.
Mean you guys said so many different.
Points that i agree with so i dupes i'd.
Rather not like repeat those but yeah my.
I'm kind of similar in your sense that i.
Didn't grow up be like in a household.
That had religion very structured.
Religion like i think both of my parents.
Were mostly christian or catholic or.
Some form of that and we never went to.
Church but i think me like growing up my.
Parents did a good job of instilling.
Like morals and stuff like that without.
Religion and then it was kind of up to.
Me and i was kind of fortunate enough to.
Be able to have friends in different.
Religions and they could kind of imprint.
Positive messages on me you know i mean.
Like i had someone who was sikh i had a.
Friend that was christian and so you.
Know like it's stuff like love thy.
Neighbor and like you know the positive.
Messages i feel like i was fortunate to.
Absorb without that's why i don't really.
Feel that i can even speak unlike a lot.
Of stuff because i never read the bible.
Like i don't you know i was just asking.
Questions because if there's an answer.
I'm willing to listen yeah for sure and.
It's not me the things i asked for some.
Sounds like i'm trying to just poke a.
Hole in your theory but really that's.
Just how i learned no question things i.
Think that my point of view being that.
Like that how i grew up i was kind of.
Just under the impression of just be.
Open-minded like like you were saying or.
You want people have been open-minded.
That's kind of what i grew up as it was.
Like i was just open-minded to so many.
Different things around because i was.
Fortunate to go to like a school and a.
Place i had a lot of different kids with.
A lot of different ethnicities and.
Religions and so i don't know i mean.
That's i think that's a pretty unique.
Like i'm not sure like a lot of people.
Didn't have that experience and so when.
It comes to like me commenting on even.
Asking of like i don't know about.
What was the one that yes david that.
Said i don't know i'm it's just like i.
Don't feel like maybe i have the.
Experience to talk on that specifically.
So ya know i think like i said.
Spirituality in in what you believe is.
Really like i said a personal thing is.
Yes something that we all have we all go.
Through it because we're all gonna die.
Right like true like i don't know about.
You like how do you feel about like.
After you die like what is what is like.
Well i want.
I hope happen yeah maybe talk about what.
You hope could potentially happen or.
What you think is actually gonna happen.
Or i see it i have a struggle between.
Kind of like you or you have like a.
Logical way of thinking about it and.
There is a part of me that you know it.
Could be that the light just go out and.
There's it's not like bad or good it's.
Just your existence is no longer right.
The neurons in your brain no longer fire.
And that's it it's like you don't have.
Any pain you don't have any suffering.
You don't have positive emotions you.
Have negative emotions but then there's.
A side of me who's been influenced from.
The society and culture and religions so.
Like that where i think okay well what i.
Would hope to happen was that you know.
Maybe there is like some form of heaven.
And then it's positive and you show up.
And maybe there's some form of judgment.
But it might not be based on whatever.
Religion is maybe it might use i hope.
That it's just based on what type of.
Person you are right so if there's.
Something that judges you that go okay.
How did you live your life did you kill.
People did you help people.
What was your intentions behind doing.
This what was your intentions behind.
Doing that and then you get judged on.
Okay if you're a good person you're in.
This good place right that's kind of.
What i hope happens rather than maybe.
Being specifically narrowed into one.
Religion because i don't know you know.
There's always that question of like how.
One thing that i remember questioning.
When i was younger was that for people.
Who don't have an experienced.
Christianity if they're on the.
Completely opposite side of the.
Continent and they've never even met.
Someone who's christian or know anything.
About it how did they get into heaven if.
They can't if they've never been.
Experienced with it that was one thing.
That i struggled with i was like a child.
Because i felt like.
You know what let's say how do you.
Answer that and then so that that's just.
Kind of like me bridging the gap in like.
My hopes which is like okay well i hope.
It's just like okay live a good life be.
A good person help people and you'll be.
Rewarded in the end you know i mean.
Regardless of what you believe.
Specifically in structured religions so.
Cuz even like you think about it like.
This like even babies that pass away or.
Like kids that didn't have a chance to.
Get into like how they cannot accept.
Jesus right because it can't comprehend.
It mm-hmm they've never had time to.
Learn it do they go to hell that's the.
Rest of things yes go to hell if they.
Die as a baby.
You go to hell because you can't accept.
Jesus you can't comprehend it i don't i.
Don't know what the answer is to that.
Trust me isn't sound right trust me.
Every christian has probably thought.
About this already let's be an answer.
For it there are some answers in.
Theories but ultimately they are.
Theories because we're not god and we.
Don't know i think god is a fair god if.
There if there's a god is god it would.
Be a fair god a god of love and but if.
But a just god as well so you know it's.
Like a it's like a father figure.
Right the father figure you're not gonna.
You want it you're gonna discipline your.
Child if you want them to grow up right.
Right you're not gonna just let them do.
Whatever they want i think in the same.
Way like sorry what was it mayn't over.
Again sorry like if you're saying.
I mean well babies you yeah people.
Haven't heard so whatever judgment that.
They're going to receive that's really.
Up to god it's not up to us to really.
Determine because there's a story in the.
Bible of like this you know when jesus.
Was crucified there were two people next.
To him they were both robbers in one of.
Them you know was a criminal like he was.
Being hung there because it was a.
Criminal and you know he asked you know.
One of them was like ridiculing jesus.
And then the other one was like hey.
Don't really kill him he's a good he was.
A good man and and jesus basically told.
The guy who like defended him i'd say.
I'm gonna see you in heaven like mmm.
It's so it's like.
You have that choice like like i said it.
Comes down to that in and if i'm being.
Honest like would i say that my choice.
In diving deep deeper into this religion.
Is out of fear in the beginning yes it.
Was a little bit i didn't want to go to.
Hell right but the more that i learn.
About it the more that i find that it's.
Less about heaven and hell it's more.
About feeling peace and in every.
Circumstance whether it's good or bad.
It's a learning experience and it's also.
Learning more about this being that's.
Out here or here or wherever it is right.
Just here that created like why am i.
Here like that's the big question i have.
For myself is what am i supposed to be.
Doing you know i just met a guy who sold.
A company in china for like nine hundred.
Million dollars he's like yeah i spent.
Six months just spending money and i was.
I got really depressed it's like what am.
What did he do now now he's like.
Starting like an education.
Yeah he's and stuff because he wants to.
Help people so that's what he found out.
In those six months like now that i have.
Reached the goal right i've talked about.
This before too like once you get to a.
Certain level of you know what you.
Always thought you wanted and you get.
That then you start to think about oh.
Well that's not enough yeah so happy.
Exactly so what the bible teaches is.
That like just be grateful in every.
Circumstance right whether things are.
Good or whether things are bad because.
That's the only way to remain truly.
Fulfilled in life because none of these.
Material things will ever bring you joy.
Now are they are they there too for you.
To enjoy yes of course but and there's.
Nothing in the bible that tells you you.
Can't enjoy things right but it's more.
About your along the journey what how.
Does this religion play a part in your.
Life and like i said if buddhism is what.
Gets you through life or catholicism or.
If you're if you're islam like yeah if.
That's what it is then then go for it.
But to each their own.
Well that was turned into a very.
Controversial i don't know if it's.
Controversial actually yeah it's just a.
Topic that you know it's gonna trigger.
Some people yeah i mean hard list yeah.
My intention is not to offend anybody.
Like i said in terms of christianity i'm.
Still on this journey i'm still learning.
Right and i do time to time look into.
Other religions to just researching and.
Seeing what you're gonna get you don't.
Have to put a disclaimer you're gonna.
Get the heat i know it's all my yeah i'm.
Okay yeah you'd be fine you're just you.
Didn't say anything really controversial.
Yeah so anyway we're gonna take a quick.
Break and we'll be back and we're back.
And we're back and we're back so on a.
Less serious topic i mean yeah i know it.
Was very interesting yeah no i mean i.
Don't say a lot of people but i do think.
There is a correlation that people have.
With being uncomfortable talking about.
Religion and especially with people that.
Have different views you know and not to.
Say that ours are different but i don't.
Know i think it's cool to hear different.
Perspectives.
You know engine milk get your ninja milk.
Thanks today thanks ninja melt dot-com.
Get it actually get it on walmart.
Walmart calm cuz we sent them a bunch so.
We got to so those out actually this has.
Been sold out in a lot of places so.
Thank you for people who bought on.
Walmart it's amazing um it's delicious.
We're trying to get it to actual stores.
Like like 7-eleven trying to but it's.
Gonna be its again it's it's us trying.
To prove that we can sell and we have.
Been so thank you guys for that but it's.
You guys some work to in order to.
Convince them i've had multiple people.
And i actually like it when they ask me.
Like what's your unlike unbiased opinion.
Right and it's i mean legitimately it's.
It's delicious it's good it isn't make.
You feel super wired like does it make.
You feel jittery.
But it gives you like for me at least.
The amount of caffeine that like amount.
A cup of coffee which is perfect you.
Know doesn't make it it's like not as.
Acidic you know some sometimes energy.
Drinks can be super acidic that's kind.
Of the goal shouldn't go for yeah smooth.
The number one complaint i get is that.
Oh why can't you make a dairy-free.
Option right right honestly i don't know.
If i can legally say this but like i've.
Been told from other people cuz i can't.
Say personally from the brands.
Perspective uh-huh that they are lactose.
Intolerant they drank a can and they.
Were fine yeah that's what i was told.
For mike my brother his which i'ma call.
His fiancee's super like lactose.
Intolerant yeah she can drink it.
Brothers the same way my mom too.
I don't know why maybe i am maybe that's.
Why i'm gassy all the time cuz i.
Shouldn't be eating like cheese and.
Stuff like that do you think it could be.
Because the milk is not american milk.
It's european milk maybe it's just.
Bitten it's just a small amount it's.
Such a tiny amount of milk that i don't.
Know i don't know i don't want to get in.
Trouble by saying that but i have heard.
I haven't heard complains that people.
Who drank it that are lactose intolerant.
Having like bad really bad breakdowns or.
Whatever whatever it's called flare-ups.
Tolerance i don't know i don't know i.
Don't know why we're doing turning into.
A commercial but yeah walmart.com go and.
Slash ninja milk i don't know if that's.
Right i don't know if it's on there yeah.
Yeah it's on walmart site and if not.
Then you can go to ninja calm i'm.
Curious to all the listeners on off the.
Pill what is your what are you what are.
Your religious beliefs and what do you.
Believe in you brought it back comment.
In comment below no cuz i'm curious oh.
Yeah because this is this is a topic.
That's i know it's controversial but.
It's also very fun for me to talk about.
Because it's is it did we say anything.
Controversial though and i don't even.
Know if i would i mean i get what you're.
Saying when you say it's controversial.
But is it no i get what he's saying but.
I don't know i don't think it is we.
Didn't say like one or the other like oh.
This is what you should believe in yeah.
I think there is asking questions true.
Unless that's wrong which i don't think.
In today's society it is wrong today's.
Questions i have doubt and not believe.
And like you were saying it's like.
Questions you would ask a pastor yeah.
And in my dating game effective i would.
I would say that's what that's for is.
Like you know going to your pastor and.
Having any conflicts yeah exactly.
And so i don't know and even attached.
Themselves they questioned everything to.
Just the same things at all.
Intellectuals question they have to.
Question themselves otherwise they would.
Be hypocrites right yeah i hope i'm.
Teaching this this religion but they.
Believe in it so much that they they are.
So convinced because of how much they.
Have learned and experienced that they.
Feel compelled to teach it but they.
Don't know the answers either nobody.
Knows all the answers everything.
Otherwise we'd be good so i mean with.
That belief technically technically like.
What we're saying is as much as i grew.
Up and i believe the theory of science.
Right does that make sense.
Yeah i think science is a theory in in.
General right it's not like we said.
There's no hundred percent yeah it's.
Very fact its fact there's scientific.
Fact but it's still scientific fact not.
Mmm-hmm.
You know i'm saying i mean i think a.
Fact is a fact well though i've seen.
Theories and facts within science yeah.
Yeah but that we're just arguing almost.
Just the words behind it right yeah it's.
Not like but you know what i mean right.
There's no hundred percent we kind of.
Discussed that like should i forgot who.
Said it but anyway with science like.
Let's say all of a sudden for all of.
Time that we remember if you drop pick.
Up an apple and drop it gravity because.
Of gravity it'll fall right it'll fall.
And hit the floor for how many years.
Have we believed in gravity or have we.
Documented this what if one day for.
Whatever reason someone picks up an.
Apple drops it and it doesn't hit the.
Floor then all of a sudden what gravity.
Is not a thing is there an explanation.
For that or is or we didn't completely.
Understand it it's not a long enough.
Period of time that humans have been.
Able to i guess investigate into science.
I think i know your your sirness.
I think i'm really confusing myself i.
Think in terms of like gravity and stuff.
Yeah i think the formulas have been.
Proven they've been proven because it.
Happens every single time you plug in.
Every it works out every single time.
Right i'm just saying hypothetically.
Yeah but there's no infinite calculator.
That shows the what am i trying to say.
So you use the result like let's say a.
Hundred million billion years from now.
Someone drops an apple and it doesn't.
Fall and it disproves the theory of.
Gravity that means gravity was never a.
Hundred percent fact and who's gonna say.
That it will in a hundred billion years.
Maybe it might change maybe it never.
Really was there may be something else.
That we don't know that we didn't.
Discover is actually causing this.
Phenomena that's all i'm saying i know.
It sounds super out there but i'm just.
Giving that perspective of like that is.
A tiniest even if i don't if even if i'm.
0.001 percent believing that there's a.
Possibility absolutely and i think like.
I mean and you know what i think that i.
Might be wrong maybe a scientist can.
Come tell me but like i think life is.
About believing in what you've.
Experienced yeah and i mean if we think.
Like that about everything in life then.
You can't live it's like it just becomes.
A choice is because i kind of i i've.
Seen things far enough to understand.
I've learned what explains this reason.
Why things fall to the ground i mean.
Wasn't einstein wrong about gravity.
Initially i could be your thing at the.
Wrong person i think i think i'm kind of.
Following what you're saying yeah let's.
Get a scientists on i really do want to.
Get i've always want to get had my.
Physics teacher back in hawaii oh and.
Actually about biology teacher that i.
Really like but there's two teachers.
That i've always wanted to have on the.
Podcast when i would make that happen.
Because they're both teachers in hawaii.
To two of them i like and i just wanted.
I don't have a bunch of random questions.
Like this that i would just like to.
Answer.
Same thing for with a pastor i would.
Like to ask.
But i would want to find like someone.
Who feels like a pro like they're a pro.
At what they do and they know everything.
Yeah i'd love to just like question him.
That would be a lot of fun all right.
Well if you're a really really.
Knowledgeable pastor out there or.
Science teacher don't want to be on the.
Show and you have some credibility we're.
Looking said it would be fun.
Yeah send us a tweet if you guys are any.
Of those people ad off the pill on.
Twitter and at off the pill podcast and.
Instagram so i mean we'd have to vet.
Them though because what if they're like.
Justice i don't want some crazy person.
I don't know i'm open to i think we.
Should start expanding to not just our.
Friend group but people that are just.
Like interesting thought leaders yeah.
Yeah you guys could also recommend who.
You guys want us to reach out to as well.
We're always looking for new people.
Ideally people who are willing to come.
To vegas my we'll do it in la - yep.
Anyway yeah this this went in a.
Direction i wasn't expecting we started.
Off with area 51 i made our way to.
Aliens aliens controlling a simulation.
Simulation first i guess science versus.
Religion yep i wasn't planning on that.
But uh that's the way the cookie.
Crumbled so and it crumbled all right i.
Had fun yeah it was fun thanks for uh.
Thanks for having me here in vegas mario.
Just picturing the comments thank you.
For your honest assessment we will get a.
Real a pastor in in a scientist one day.
So like we said hit us up we are open to.
The idea i think would be interesting.
And and if this is the most boring.
Podcast ever we're sorry but i was.
Interested that's why we stuck on the.
Same topic basically the whole time but.
With that being said remember follow us.
At off the pill on twitter at off the.
Pill podcast and instagram and pretty.
Much that's it yeah this the same way in.
So religion let's talk about it.
