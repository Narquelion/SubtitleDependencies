Hey guys so sorry that was in a post.
Last week i mean other than the podcast.
We've actually been pretty on point this.
Year with the posting and you know.
Especially with the podcast we haven't.
Missed a week yet that's a miracle for.
Us but anyway the reason why there was.
No video last week was because i did not.
Do anything last week i was in la and.
This is something i never thought i.
Would be admitting on this channel but.
The reason for that trip was because of.
Valentine's day that's right i'm not.
Single.
Music.
Hey what the hell are you guys doing oh.
It's seen for you yeah we're just happy.
For you man it's a miracle it's not a.
Miracle stop making it seem like it's so.
Hard to believe we're not yeah we're.
Just happy yeah we totally believe okay.
You know what can you guys just leave.
Because this was actually supposed to be.
A serious announcement for once and you.
Guys are turning into some kind of weird.
Skit joke thing oh is this not weird.
Joke no and frankly it's a little.
Insulting that you guys would assume.
That we definitely thought it was a skit.
Yeah or some kind of trolling right.
Because like that's is you usually do.
When it comes to relationships and stuff.
Yeah like the last time when he was.
Going to reveal his girlfriend but it.
Just ended up being greg you know when i.
Saw ha because if we didn't see that.
Predictable those guys i am not trolling.
And i'm not gonna make some kind of joke.
So can you please just let me do my.
Thing is the longer we prolong this hey.
The less serious it becomes and for once.
I am trying to be open about this part.
Of my life so you're actually serious.
Yes so you really do have a girlfriend.
Yes how many times do i have to tell you.
Guys that i have a girl.
Yeah that was my way of saying that i'm.
Actually being serious this time carly.
Could have just said that but you know.
Why not add a few more hours to filming.
And editing pay for all those costumes.
To look guys all jokes aside i am being.
Serious i am not single and i haven't.
Been for a while now believe it or not.
And no it's not the best-kept secret in.
The world i mean there's bunch of rumors.
I just never publicly came out and said.
It people have seen us in public.
Together we've been in pictures together.
We took trips together because we don't.
Really go out of our way to hide it.
We just i've never announced we just.
Both decided that it'd be best for the.
Relationship at least in the beginning.
To not say anything publicly and then we.
Just kind of continued to not announce.
It because it's just it just became the.
Norm looking like a huge secret or.
Anything but since i am trying to be a.
Little bit more open and honest on this.
Channel with like you know the podcasts.
Or videos like this i felt like it'd be.
Really hard to continue to do that.
Without you know revealing anything.
About this aspect of my life especially.
Because it's such a big part of and i'm.
Not trying to make this all overly.
Dramatic or a bigger deal than it really.
Is but with that being said i'm just.
Gonna get straight to the point.
So no more theatrics lights i am going.
To be revealing for the first time ever.
My secret girlfriend of almost two.
Entire years three entire i will be.
Revealing my secret girlfriend of three.
To five years for the first time ever.
By play romantic song that i wrote for.
Her this belated valentine's day about.
Some of the greatest moments and.
Memories from our relationship showing.
Just how great we are together but more.
Importantly how great i am the.
Boyfriends another one of those videos.
Isn't it yep oh and i know you can't see.
Because of the sheet but there's this.
Really beautiful slideshow thing that i.
Made of the two of us since i don't like.
To say pictures of us i kinda didn't.
Have that much to work with so i had to.
Do some editing.
Music.
Music.
To be honest and forgive.
Guess 2010 because that's when ask him.
Out and we didn't work out there but the.
Five years passed and we did a collab.
You were a hot song on some mtv cares.
He on his side and ear for that show.
Went to your viewing party for your.
Episode because i had to let you know i.
Was into you i wanted to let you know.
The truth about how i was a completely.
In love even though it's been only a.
Month with you but think i did in there.
Was infatuated.
The honeymoon stage only lasted a few.
Months that believe that we can a.
Reminisce don't remember.
First aid let us remember the first kiss.
.
Trip than a mr. mountain in truth in my.
Left eye now to get a nappy i was.
Needing a little bit but let me get back.
To being romantic i remember taking our.
First trip across the atlantic well the.
Pacific but that doesn't ride as well.
And i she was a business trip so we're.
Working the whole time in the hotel but.
The point is i remembered it and i.
Remember other things like our.
Anniversary is probably on the 26 for.
23rd i was pretty close this.
Like a fan.
All these years valentine's day.
Don't be late.
Music.
This right over.
Guess it's time to say your name if the.
Song needs.
Music.
It's a chow arden arden cho not jade.
Again it didn't rhyme as well so i just.
Had to kind of change it up a little bit.
What's the reveal already oh right um.
Sorry ladies and gentlemen i'm so proud.
To announce my girlfriend arden cho.
Music.
I mean technically this is not her but.
What we called it another troll video.
With another disappointing ending what.
No guys this is not a troll video i'm.
Not trolling the point remains the same.
I'm still reviewing the fact that i'm.
Dating arden she just couldn't be here.
Because she's filming the show in.
Chicago so i got something stand-in.
That's it well yes you did kinda reveal.
Yeah see but the whole sheet revealed.
Thing wasn't it i don't like unnecessary.
Yeah but i mean so are you guys right i.

Are bein a bit like here besides who is.
That anyway.
Wait no i don't think my god who the.
Hell is rt che.
