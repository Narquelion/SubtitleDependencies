Hey guys so before we get to the actual.
Video i have a huge announcement.
I said huge announcement thank you i.
Just wanted that you guys know that i am.
A genius now in the literal li eyes.
Because i wrote a book well okay i start.
Working out again and i know this is.
Very sudden news for a lot of you.
Especially if you don't follow me on.
Twitter at the real ryan higa or my.
Instagram at not ryan higa.
Or on my facebook at facebook.com so.
That but the reason for that is that i.
Don't like to promote myself or my own.
Products because i think that's very.
Selfish and conceited and i think.
Facebook.com slash shiva tv that's what.
It was.
Make sure you guys like my page share.
All my videos and make sure you guys go.
Check it out right now yeah i wrote a.
Book it is called how to write good and.
This is the cover this is not the actual.
Book i just print out the cover and put.
It on a different book this is.
Radiographic pathology for technologists.
Fifth edition and obviously my book is.
Gonna be better because my book has.
Picture this has pictures of brains and.
So i don't know why i'm why am i reading.
But yeah i wrote the book taught how to.
Write good it's very i mean it came from.
My mind so it's very different and i.
Mean i'm gonna be honest it's it's super.
Weird i don't think that most people who.
Casually read books are gonna like it.
Because it's so different but i say that.
You have a big announcement i did that.
In fact i say it was huge don't let the.
Fans know that this is a promo of course.
Not i'm not an idiot and very important.
My book sound interesting to not call.
Book weird or anything else negative.
Towards this book how to write good is.
So damn good it is sorry so damn well.
Can be making those kind of mistakes.
Anymore published author now.
This is the best book ever it is not.
Weird it is not anything that i have to.
Say negative about it is exactly like.
Every other best-selling book out there.
Right now except for the fact that it.
Hasn't sold that much yet but other than.
That it's the same thing there's a cover.
With pictures in it there are words so.
Many words i have the best words huge.
Words i'm going off-topic the reason why.
I bring this up other than the fact that.
I am promote not promoting my book is.
Because writing a book is a very.
Important stage in a youtubers career it.
Means that i am in one of the final.
Stages of my youtube career and my.
Youtube life so yeah what are you guys.
Doing that means we can get out of here.
Right yeah it's really cramped back here.
I have to poop so bad no i said one of.
The final stages not the end just just.
Watch the video there are 10 major.
Stages in the life of a youtuber you.
Already know one of the final stages.
Called write a book but we'll get to.
That later also keep in mind some of.
These stages may be out of order for.
Some people but for the most part these.
Are stages that almost every youtuber.
Goes through at some point so let's.
Start with the first one stage one just.
For fun not all but the majority of.
Youtubers first started creating their.
Youtube channels because of an interest.
That they had and they want to give it a.
Shot.
Not for fame not for money and they.
Basically started making videos just for.
Fun stage two i'm smelling poo cuz cuz.
You're famous now so you think you're.
The you know you could have made a.
Better title than that ya feel like you.
Just said that because it rhymes you.
Know what guys can i just stage - i'm.
Smelling poop this is the stage where.
You first start to discover your.
Popularity start getting recognized on.
The streets you have fans you want pics.
And autographs and for you you pretend.
Like you don't enjoy all this attention.
Because it happens all the time.
Deep down let's be real you love it cuz.
You feel special stage 3 f everyone.
Hates minh more successful you get the.
More hate and negativity you will.
Receive and this is the stage where you.
Make your first video about haters and.
Why you can't understand why they're so.
Hateful because it bothers you a lot.
Knowing that even though you're so loved.
There's a lot of people out there that.
Hate you stage four haters don't bother.
Me no more stage four is when you get.
Even more popular the.
Of your youtube career and with all that.
Fame you get more and more haters but.
Now that you've seen it so much you've.
Learned that hating on haters doesn't.
Work this is the part where you put on a.
Cool guy act and pretend that hater.
Comments don't affect you anymore but in.
Reality it still does stage 5 run is.
Died there's always that moment after.
Your peak of your youtube career where.
Things start to slow down a little bit.
And that's when you begin to freak out.
And start questioning yourself you start.
Doubting your own content and eventually.
You start to change your content in.
Order to try and bring your growth back.
To what it used to be it's pretty much.
Desperation time this is where you start.
Using the old strategy such as clickbait.
Thumbnails and titles collabing with.
Other random youtubers so you can.
Increase your subs and this is also.
Where you start doing more of the.
Popular trendy challenges just anything.
It takes to get you more viewers and.
After a while of doing this you get to a.
Point where your content is not even.
What you started out making you're just.
Making stuff to get views stage 6.
Kumbaya positivity is you're depressed.
Now because your youtube fame has been.
Dying down for a while now however this.
Is a stage that you magically turn that.
All around by watching one inspirational.
Motivational speaker on facebook talk.
About happiness and then you take that.
Speaker's advice to heart and.
Over-exaggerated not just to yourself.
But to all of your fans as well stage.
Setting the big dis saggin hope you're a.
Few months of being overly positive you.
Realize that you are putting up a front.
And you weren't really as happy as you.
Were pretending to be or preaching.
Others to be now you must decide you.
Keep making youtube videos or do you.
Quit and go and pursue something else.
Like acting or making a movie and.
Regardless of what you decide you still.
Make a video telling all your fans that.
You want to quit youtube stage eh just.
Kidding mike you told everyone you were.
Done with you too but you're back it was.
A joke what a surprise after such a long.
Break from youtube you feel hyped and.
Refreshed and ready to start taking.
Youtube serious again you also found.
That passion again um what first got you.
Start however this doesn't last very.
Long because of your long break from.
Youtube your growth and your view.
Perhaps it's time to take drastic.
Measures maybe you should rebrand.
Yourself maybe start drama with another.
Youtuber maybe it's not about what kind.
Of videos you wanna make but what kind.
Of videos will get you more views stage.
9 write a book yeah i started the whole.
Priming the title thing after the intro.
So you know stage 9 write a book time.
Stage 9 write a book time is to write a.
Book like i mentioned earlier one of the.
Last stages in a youtubers life is to.
Write a book this is the point where you.
Believe that you've gone through so much.
That you feel the need to write a book.
First you finish writing the book then.
You don't promote it at all which makes.
The book publishing company very upset.
With you and tells you that you need to.
Promote it or else which you then say i.
Don't care you don't scare me i'm not.
Gonna sell out and make a promotional.
Video just to sell books what kind of.
Person do you think i am someone would.
Just randomly promote my book how to.
Write good and say that oh it's.
Available for pre-order in amazon right.
Now links are in the description next to.
My tour dates that i am going to be.
Going on in the next month in the.
Following cities absolutely not.
Is what i you is what you say then stage.
10 the end this is the stage after you.
Write your book the final stage you're.
Finally in a great place where you're.
Happy and satisfied and content with.
What you've done with your youtube.
Career and you finally think it's time.
To make that last video it's a heartfelt.
Video where tz music begins to play.
Where you start thanking everybody for.
Everything that they've done for you for.
This incredible ten eleven year journey.
Whatever it is for you that you've been.
On and you just try to show how much you.
Truly truly appreciate them and even.
Though you're known to be comedic and.
You shouldn't be know taken seriously.
This is the one time that you are.
Genuine with your viewers and you really.
Really just can't thank them enough for.
Everything that they've done.
And you know it gets a little cheesy but.
None of that really matters because it's.
All about appreciation you have for the.
Fans and well it it's time it's the end.
The end of stage 10 on to safety 11 what.
Stage 11 the same issue i had rhyming.
Which seven stage 11 set heaven heaven.

Is stage 1 1 because in stage 1 1 you.
Repeat back to stage 1 but you have to.
Ice the fun because you finally.
Understand how to truly live like a.
Youtuber and enjoy because as we know.
That was the whole goal to begin with to.
Have fun.
It's one big completed circle do what.
You want to make me what you want to.
Make who cares if it's a boring video.
With no skits and it cares that there's.
Really poor drawings in there even if.
