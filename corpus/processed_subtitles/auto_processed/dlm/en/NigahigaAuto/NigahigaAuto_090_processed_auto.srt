Like on my birth certificate your your.
Youtube name is timothy delegate yeah.
Yeah i just thought timothy like rolls.
Better with the delaghetto.
You know yeah timothy like i know and i.
Mean speaking of which because you i.
Said og youtuber you were around when.
Did you start probably my current.
Channel to this day my current main.
Channel is oh six right.
I had one channel before that in oh five.
That got like just someone gets my.
Password and delete all my videos you.
Know that is so what you know you know.
What's crazy though youtube has all.
Those backed up do they yeah i don't.
Know if sure say this i could probably.
Say this i deleted a ton of videos when.
Like copyright strike started to happen.
Yeah right when we got youtube.
Partnership i think that was like oh.
Seven you didn't private him you just.
Deleted him i didn't know i didn't know.
Better.
I was like i don't want to get sued yes.
I just had started making money mm-hmm.
And they flagged like i guess all of my.
Videos had music so i started deleting.
Like like all of them mm-hmm and then i.
Went back i think it was a couple years.
Later and they i don't know what.
Happened they updated youtube or.
Something and they were all in my head.
My inventory and like in my my videos so.
Like i have like lip syncs and stuff.
That i'm like 5,000 views desk raised.
May have everything and i deleted i know.
For a fact i deleted them i every they.
Keep it oh    it's probably all in.
Some like crazy database mail dude yes.
There's videos you didn't want up it's.
There oh i mean anything that got.
Deleted with that first channel it was.
So stupid too cuz i was like i remember.
I was really just excited i had like 500.
Subscribers on my first channel and it.
Was um there's a lot back then that was.
A lot no well it was oh it was no okay.
Actually i had a couple it was one.
Called funky fresh.
That was my first channel ever ever ever.
And um and my channel my password was.
Funky cuz i was just dumb and lazy and i.
Was like and i always forget my password.
And i think one day somebody had just.
Like was    around and um i can say.
That right yeah oh yeah somebody was a.
Alright and guess my password.
And like it was literally i have maybe.
10 videos that were there of just me.
Freestyling or doing whatever and they.
All got deleted and and someone had just.
Uploaded like choreography videos you.
Know and then and that's when i started.
The timothy delaghetto.
Account and um and then i lost that one.
Because i don't know if you remember but.
Way back then when youtube first started.
Out there was no like moderation you.
Know no one really paying attention that.
How everything worked but if somebody.
Just flagged your video enough it would.
Just get taken up.
I do remember right so there was no you.
Know limited access or 18 or older it.
Was just automatically taken down yeah.
And then they also had a three-strike.
Rule so if you had three videos taken.
Down your channel was just deleted you.
Know and then i think there was a time.
On my original timothy delaghetto.
Channel where i think just like a.
Handful of like haters we're just.
Constantly flagging my videos.
And within like a week and a half it was.
Like video taken out video takedown.
Video taken down channel suspended young.
And then i had to start all over and i.
Think it's because i mean like you you.
Kind of i mean your content especially.
Back then you really like push the limit.
Right yeah and yeah well you know what.
And and also back then i mean i remember.
Specifically a couple of videos that.
That got deleted that week it was just.
Tell us about it.
It was silly stuff bra like i wasn't.
Even taking it seriously yet it was.
Literally like a video of me and a.
Friend of mine like making out that's.
One of them and then stuff from like my.
Cell phone you know like me maybe like.
Playing with like a butt or something.
You know this is way back it's like.
Single working at california pizza.
Kitchen tim like just having fun with my.
Friends on my phone i was like oh let me.
Upload this video me like playing with.
My friends but you know and so you.
Didn't start off wrapping then it was it.
Was a combination of stuff it was um me.
Freestyling and then whatever just.
Random that we've got you to start.
Youtube kind of what got me to start.
Youtube specifically was you know my boy.
Pd flow yeah.
So me and pd flow we went to high school.
Together and pd flow and my boy.
Super-ego and rick we all went to high.
School together and me people and eric.
Specifically we used to make these like.
Short films in high school and we had.
One that we did call jason versus gumby.
That like pd flow put on his website and.
And it started to get some traction.
Online like it was getting spread around.
A lot not even when there weren't a lot.
Of you know there weren't websites to.
Share videos back right so his website.
Was like running out of bandwidth you.
Know i'm saying it would shut down.
Because we couldn't afford to keep the.
Website up with all the hits were.
Getting so one day i was on myspace and.
Someone posted a bullet in my space is a.
Website where people used and someone.
Posted a bullet in it was like look at.
These white girls dancing to laffy taffy.
Lol so i'm like okay what is this about.
It clicked on it i watched the video i.
Lol but i was like wow this is a website.
Where anybody can put any video and.
It'll give you like an embed code for.
Your myspace this is crazy.
So i told peter i was a young man we can.
Just put our videos on this website and.
We don't have to worry about bandwidth.
And.
That stuff so we put our little sortes.
On there and then i was like maybe this.
Is a good way to get my face out there.
So i just started uploading just like.
Silly stuff like me freestyling or like.
You know lip-syncing and then i would.
Tag all my freestyle videos as jin 106.
And park freestyle friday asian.
Freestyle don't know that's another.
Completely different person asian rapper.
That's smart though that's what you had.
To do back yes i think you know so i.
Would get the occasional comments of.
Like lol to st. jean you are right.
Though the biggest compliment yeah.
Exactly i don't like ten people that.
Were like like what the hell was this it.
Was a handful of people okay you know i.
Think i like this well speaking since.
We're talking about like rap and stuff.
Like that for those that don't know you.
Are on a tv show for how long six.
Seasons eight season six years wow dunno.
Why i was on mtv right stan tv oh it's.
Open you're not doing it oh yeah i am.
Not on the sony maja.
What happened were there um you know.
What it was just um we i was feeling.
Like it was getting a little repetitive.
For me and i had been telling the guys.
In our little while in our group chat.
For a couple years a couple seasons like.
I ja think is my last one i think i'm i.
Think i'm cool i'm ready to move on.
There's my last one but i will keep.
Doing it you know and then um one day we.
Just we kind of had a mutual well one of.
The producers like hey man i don't think.
We're gonna have you anymore they broke.
Up with me basically oh they told you.
That.
Well yeah cuz i mean i already had it in.
My head that yeah maybe i'll do one more.
Season and then i'll move on and tell.
You why i've heard a few different.
Things so so one of the producers called.
Me up and he's like hey man do you have.
Time to talk and i was like ah    he's.
Breaking up with me i'll say i was like.
This is the break-up talk you know yeah.
And because he text me is you got time.
To talk i was like yeah bro i got time.
To talk but if this is if this is what i.
Think it is you owe me steak dinner and.
I'm i'm going somewhere expensive yeah.
And i'm ordering everything and he's.
Just lol there's like okay it's going.
Down yeah so he called me and he was.
Like yeah you know what um he was just.
Like you know i think you know we're.
Gonna go in a different direction and i.
Was like sorry man cool cool works for.
Me and.
Because is did they replace with another.
Asian dude the only asian they've been.
Trying they've been trying without many.
People like you man.
I agree you know and they've been trying.
To fill that void a little bit um so.
They so they kind of you know retired me.
As i like to call it or fired me if you.
Want to say that but um and then they.
Brought in a rice gum try they tried it.
Out oh man they tried it out i don't.
Think that really works for anybody you.
Know saying you guys are opposites i.
Feel like yeah and you know while.
Announced is a different beast you know.
Yeah and like i can be quick and i don't.
Know maybe he is for all i know i.
Haven't heard him rap it feels more.
Though that tim is like an authentic.
Genuine character who can like yeah.
Really you really fit that you know like.
You it didn't seem like oh they're.
Trying to fit diversity here honey that.
Asian audience is just like not tim.
Matches yeah what else i think about it.
When i used to watch wilin out cuz it.
Was it was on way back and then i was.
Basically brought on i was brought on.
For like the reboot you know um and so.
When it was on back in the day i was.
Like yo i would be perfect on this show.
But i remember i think i was like in.
High school or you know and i was like i.
Would be dope on the show cuz i was i.
Was rapping and i was funny you know and.
This show is like rapping and being.
Funny here i'm saying so when i heard.
They brought it back i was like ah yes.
Let me get in there.
Did was actually they have a say about.
How i got on no so would you like to.
Know i would love to know okay well let.
Me tell you some i heard nick cannon was.
Bringing wilin out back so i followed.
Him on twitter and then one day he.
Tweeted who's the funniest person online.
Whoever gets the most retweets of.
Hashtag wilin out needs me i'll audition.
Personally so at that point you know i.
Had a decent youtube following this pop.
Like 2012-2013 and so i got a bunch of.
Retweets and then someone deemed me and.
They were like if you would really like.
To audition contact this person come to.
This address i was like sweet and and.
Also during that whole process a friend.
Of the producer who was a guy i knew was.
Like hey man i know the producer if you.
Really want to get in there i'll get you.
In there and i went in for the audition.
And nick already knew who i was from he.
Knew me as a rapper.
Not necessarily comedian yeah cuz on.
Some super random random stuff he used.
To manage this artist name collect car.
And that year or the year before that.
Billboard came out with this chart.
Called the uncharted chart and it was.
Basically people who were kind of doing.
Their thing online and and i was number.
One on when they premiered the the chart.
Because you know i was doing like i was.
Doing music and stuff too yeah and so i.
Guess nick just saw me on that list so i.
Auditioned and they had me like.
Freestyle and we played some improv.
Games and and it was stuff like they'd.
Say kevin hart is in front of you right.
Now dissing with a rap you know stuff.
Like that yeah and we do that and they.
Called me back for the group audition to.
See how you are with the other would-be.
Cast members what we'd like makeup games.
And stuff and yeah and then they call me.
Next week so i was on the show and yeah.
Yeah and i was like you know like seven.
Years ago but did like six seasons and.
So and then they about eight seasons.
Eight seasons six years and they kick me.
Off and brought on rice go and tried.
That out i don't think he had fun either.
Though yeah yeah i think he was like.
Knowing just knowing him personally i.
Can't see him really doing do you wanna.
Do want to name-drop who you're.
Competing against to get on the show as.
An asian yeah well oh do you know this.
Story yeah you do no i don't know this.
Story so so you know they kind of were.
Looking to fulfill that kind of token.
Asian spot you know cuz a majority black.
Cast and it came down to me and.
Dumbfounded oh and um and if you ask the.
Producer or if you even asked dumb like.
What went wrong on his audition he'll be.
Like i messed up my freestyle i don't.
Know what happened i like i'm his dope.
Too dumb is amazing he's like a.
Freestyle guy.
I know his freestyle is crazy and i.
Guess he just got nervous yeah yes i was.
Like oh good for me.
But he doesn't really like you do like.
Funny yeah um is more like a serious no.
He's got jokes oh really.
Yeah he's like i mean he's dope so i.
Figured he takes it so serious you know.
I think we both agree that um that ended.
Up the best though like for the best yes.
And like i think i was the perfect.
For you yeah that's like your comedy you.
Were actually i mean like i didn't watch.
The show i watched on like facebook.
Video and stuff yeah yeah yeah all your.
Stuff was always like really good like.
Really smart well thought out thanks me.
And sometimes it would just be so like.
When they would go at you yeah i mean.
Maybe i have a bias because i'm asian.
But all the jokes are the same like.
Every single time i don't know maybe i.
Mean i'm sure you saw a lot oh you're.
Right well that's the thing too is like.
Scene with the nick cannon jokes i know.
That was really annoying to see well the.
Thing is when people complain about you.
Know they only came out you with the.
Same jokes i mean they did but at the.
Same time everybody kind of played their.
Part like i got it you know everyone has.
Their role in the show where they would.
Get made fun of for the same stuff like.
The fat dude would get the fat jokes and.
You know the white girl justina she gets.
All the you're a    joke centers but.
Even if it's the same kind of joke it's.
The way you tell it right totally.
So like the little to me you and the.
Short black guy was really conceited yes.
Really he's so clever with it he's.
Clever and that's the thing and there's.
Another white guy on there named sharone.
From canada who's also yeah he's he's.
Good at switching up old jokes and.
Putting a new spin on him you know and i.
Was tell people i'm like the thing about.
Those the reason why those jokes were so.
Easy for me to rebuttal was cuz i've.
Been hearing those jokes in the whole.
Life yeah yeah so i mean not of the.
Whole cast oh actually you know you you.
Roasted a lot of like celebrities - out.
Of everybody who like you met during.
Doing the show you met a bunch of.
Celebrities right yeah who was the worse.
On the show like as a like just as a.
Talk about your personal experimental.
Areas pretty much every week well you.
Know what was annoying his first time on.
And then the second time on he was super.
Nice yes so i don't know what changed.
But like the first time rick ross came.
On he came on with like 15 different.
People that they insisted would all be.
On the stage you know i'm saying and it.
Was very like the whole atmosphere was.
Very tense you know because i feel like.
He didn't wanna look dumb and even even.
Like there was kind of like a little.
They were like hey guys you know no no.
Fat jokes for rick ross and that was.
Yeah there's no veg sometimes sometimes.
What kind of coming with certain.
Restrictions like and and don't touch.
Areas and he they were like no fat jokes.
But the hidden but then nick made a fat.
Joke so it's not like you know him as.
The boss man i guess he was allowed but.
Then the next time rick ross came on.
Super nice didn't have his whole.
Entourage and it was down to make jokes.
I mean especially since i guess he had.
Lost a lot of weight but that was.
Probably one of the most like i don't.
Know just like the the vibe felt a.
Little yeah you know i mean it might be.
Also like he was hesitant you know yeah.
Not sure how this goes and then after.
That show aired you know maybe he saw.
Like a jump in sales jump the extremes.
He's like oh this is good for me i think.
Everybody's a little weary to go on.
While a now because they don't wanna you.
Know they don't wanna feel like you know.
They're gonna get made fun of and it's.
Gonna go viral or anything like that but.
Especially that first season was kind of.
Hard to get guests but i think now that.
It's been on for like a few years now.
And people realize it's all just fun and.
Games like movin yeah exactly it's cool.
So you're cool with nick cannon then.
Next cool yeah no we're we're good we're.
Good.
I mean it's not like we're homies i mean.
It's always like you see people make.
Jokes about the boss you know yeah there.
Was a made it seem like i don't know.
There's a lot of things you people would.
Say your cast would say yeah and i was.
Always like do you guys actually like.
Him like that was all you know it's all.
Just fun and games nick makes a good.
Dude nick if anything nick is a very.
Supportive guy you know if he like fs.
With you as a person he will put you in.
Other things he'll let you know if he.
Has like a part in a movie he wants you.
For and he's just a supportive dude.
Actually what i heard through the.
Grapevine i don't even know how true.
This is but what i heard about the.
Reason why they decided not to bring me.
Back another season is i heard that nick.
Was going through like the list of.
People of the cast and he and he said.
This is what i heard i heard he was like.
He got to my name and was like i feel.
Like tim could be doing more and then.
That's why it's sad to let me go so i.
Don't know if that was just like i'm.
Gonna say that and make myself feel.
Better about like letting him go or if.
That was um that's how he genuinely.
Feels by the way it's all up yeah yeah.
But you said you were trying to not like.
You're trying to get off the show for a.
While anyway.
Yeah i mean i i didn't really voice that.
To too many people maybe like a producer.
That i was really close to shout out to.
Rachel.
And a few cast members that you know.
Just in the group chat i'm like you know.
What guys i mean maybe this is it for me.
But i was but it was so hard to say no.
When it's like because we shoot the.
Whole season in two and a half three.
Weeks so it's like why wouldn't i go on.
A free trip for three weeks and live in.
A hotel for free have fun you know get.
Drunk on stage like play stupid games.
With celebrities and get a check you.
Know but you know it just got a little.
Got a little old for me you know so it.
Was cool.
Well i guess continuing with a wild and.
Out stuff there's a brief moment in time.
I don't know if you're still doing this.
I haven't seen you tweet about it but.
You were doing improv shows oh you know.
What that i was doing shows at the.
Improv theaters but i wasn't doing ask.
What improv shows what that was was hold.
On this is your area some are second.
What that was was a me and i would bring.
On special guests and i was doing a live.
Game show called follow me and and well.
Basically they had they had approached.
Me with the opportunity to host his game.
Show and it was like we would get.
Volunteers from the audience and just.
See what how much they would embarrass.
Themselves for money you know so it.
Would be like let us go through your.
Pictures in your phone or let us go.
Through your text messages what's your.
What's a crazy talent you can do and and.
It was awful like a thousand bucks it.
Was a good time it was it was a nice.
Little fun little check you know just.
Get people up there embarrass them i.
Wouldn't have to really even like do.
Anything really and that's what that was.
Okay i mean i have that improv in the.
Past like i took improv classes in.
College and stuff and you know yeah i.
Met wayne brady on a plane and you guys.

On the plane for a little bit and.
Exchanged numbers talk    about you.
For a good hour and then but yeah he was.
Supposed to be the guy he was supposed.

The interest of like acquiring the show.
And and so i was down cuz you know i.
Wasn't making any money doing it cuz.
Like you know i had to pay for like the.
Food and the basses and the crew and the.
Editing and all that    so i sold the.
Thrillist.
And um and i've been doing it with him.

Never had it before.
Yes i haven't either yeah and and let me.
Just say ryan's face was really funny.
What is that i tried to not make it look.
Like i hate like yeah it was it was a.
Good face dude it was i think the ideal.
Reaction that i have a very.
I have bad was expressions no like just.
Like just being conscious of what my.
Face is doing yeah like you can't.
Connect oh yeah like i look like mad.
More than i usually a.m. yeah nothing.
Face i do have that yes yeah like.
I'm not mad i know i have the same well.
That's because that's when i'm engaged.
Doing conscious of it when i like when.
We're when i'm interacting am i i got a.
Happy ass face but when it's chilling.
When i'm not talking buddy not doing.
Anything people like i've heard like.
I've gotten multiple multiple comments.
When people like man i was gonna say.
What's up to you but you look pissed.
Like you're in a rush i was like no.
That's just my face yeah i wish i had.
Those like you know some people just.
Have a like a natural like kind of up on.
The sides of their mouth you wish you.
Had an approach.
Well my god like you know there's some.
People that just walk around they're.
Just kinda like oh yeah i know that's.
Not me yeah me too.
If anything my my jaws droop a little.
Bit yeah like i don't like i try to be.
More conscious of that yeah i have to i.
Learned i should probably think about.
That a little bit more be more conscious.
Of your face people have been telling me.
That's hard it's hard to always be.
Conscious of your face if anything i'm.
Just jonah my posture is terrible my.
Face is droopy.
You're pretty self-aware though i mean.
Like to be a battle rapper you have to.
Really know yourself right cuz i mean if.
Anything now i'm always just kind of uh.
Especially when the cameras are.
Following us around like when we're.
Shooting send foods i wear more that.
There are people potentially like taking.
Cell phone footage so i try to like just.
Like stand up straight my chin gets kind.
Of squishy when i'm just looking down.
That stuff really bother you then when.
You would see the playback or is it.
Because yeah sometime think it'll affect.
Your what your viewership or no just for.
Me in general i like to look cute you.
Know i have a little makeup on right now.
I'm grateful for this light you have.
Here and i'm also grateful that you're.
Shooting me from the right side because.
On some locus is exactly what your shoot.
We were swish i have a good like not.
Good but this is like i rather get john.
This side yeah you rather get shot on.
That side yeah for your shoot we both.
Had our bad sides oh i didn't know that.
That was your bad side too yeah like if.
You would have said that we could have.
Made not an argument i don't want to be.
The only one like this is my bad side.
Get so let's switch seats.
I didn't really care i'd prefer decide.
And it sounds silly for people that like.
Don't really consider that a thing but.
If you've seen yourself on camera enough.
Like girls get it girls get it they.
Always look at a girl's instagram it's.
Always the same angle oh dude me too.
Secretly i'm gonna put it put together.
Its bags though well and people that.
Know me like rick like one bit whatever.
People will laugh about me having a good.
Side like my boy rick he'll be like oh.
No no his left side is way wonky erisa.
It's just not as um you know what's the.
Word symmetrical yeah i'm just like.
Beside cute besides ill you know it.
Doesn't look bad dude no but you know.
Your face it's not bad it's a tiny thing.
Huh yeah so i guess talking about.
Insecurities for both of you guys you.
Know a little bit do you want to like.
Touch up on that like cuz one thing that.
You've always talked about and almost is.
Like like that big dick energy you know.
Where people are like oh my gosh like.
How are you how are you with your now.
Wife right right right you would.
Constantly preach like these people.
Clearly don't understand more than just.
The physical right i mean and you know.
What no but you know what no no no even.
Like    what you just said because.
Physically i'm cute whenever people.
Would like just like defend me like okay.
So if some would say damn housed him.
With his like tim is out of her league.
Or whatever even with like my ex or my.
Or my wife and then and people would try.
To defend me like maybe she doesn't only.
Care about looks i'm like oh hold on i.
Feel like yeah like confidence is.
Important confidence is key you know and.
Even when i was like a little kid and.
You know i was thinking about this the.
Other day cuz someone's like dude how.
Are you so confident and and i would.
Always give the the answer of like and.
And this is true to not that this isn't.
True but i would say you know i always.
Felt like it life is so short why waste.
Time worrying about what other people.
Think about you you know cuz i feel like.
People are people are gonna find you.
Ugly and people are gonna find you hot.
And like people are gonna love you and.
People gonna hate you but at the end of.
The day um worrying on that and dwelling.
On that is really gonna keep you from.
Enjoying life to its full potential you.
Know cause like if you're if you're.
Self-conscious about like oh my god how.
Do i look if i'm doing this and like.
This person's gonna hate me and this.
Girl's gonna reject me you're there's so.
Many things that you're not gonna try.
And attempt and you just never know do.
You do you feel like part of that too.
Though is because you kind of prep for.
That like you've kind of like like for.
Example like sitting on that side.
Like showing your good side do you feel.
Like i know that i prepped for this like.
I put a little bit makeup on but i feel.
Like i look good so i'm confident enough.
To put that energy out there if you.
Hadn't done all that stuff do you feel.
Like you would feel the same way okay.
See in this and that's and that's funny.
That you brought that up because i was.
Thinking like okay why why am i really.
Confident because you know how i said.
Life is too short to care about it and.
Then i started thinking why don't i care.
Why didn't i ever care even as a little.
Kid and i realized this is the reason.
Dude i loved girls so much that's like a.
Little kid i was never like worried that.
Oh this girl thinks i'm ugly i was like.
I'm gonna try and kiss this girl pretty.
I'm gonna hold her hand you know i think.
Not gonna lie i feel like that was my.
Main motivator for just like not giving.
A f growing up you know it's like you.
Know what did i think this was cute um i.
Know i'm hilarious i always tell people.
Like i know i'm not like the guy that.
Walks into a room and a girl's like man.
I'm gonna suck this dudes penis you know.
But i say give me like ten minutes of.
Conversation by the punch bowl and the.
Chips and she's like you know i might.
Suck this dude's penis because at some.
Point there must have been a time where.
You realize oh i'm good at conversation.
Right so i mean to get to that point to.
Even talk to girls most people your.
Average person i would say even most.
People in general you don't naturally as.
A kid you know that oh you know what i'm.
Good at this.
Until you make a realization it must.
Have been a moment in your life when you.
Realize like you know i can do this.
Maybe i mean i just um were you always.
Just naturally gifted that way i.
Wouldn't even say it i was gifted i just.
I just feel like i liked making people.
Laugh uh-huh um and i was always doing.
That ever since i was a little kid um i.
Think my mom always told me i was cute.
To help build my self-confidence you.
Know and i was always like i liked being.
Um i like making people laugh and i i.
Guess i liked like a sexy tension yeah.
Well thanks i i'll tell you i'm not that.
Funny i just work really hard you know.
And and i'm likable you know i hope like.
I malls like i'm not the funniest person.
In the world like i'm really not but i.
Think i think people enjoy working with.
Me and and and going back to just the.
Confidence i don't know man maybe just.
Was always as in me you know like.
Because i remember just being a little.
Kid you know and the janitor at my.
School being like you you walk you walk.
Like a big man okay so you had it for.
You it wasn't that kind of a natural.
Thing your upbringing and that's just.
You i think maybe man i think my parents.
Just loved me you know made me feel good.
About myself.
Laughed at my jokes told me i was cute.
And we know it's thanks that's how you.
Raised a successful kid you know their.
Confidence for sure cool well real quick.
We're about to take a quick she she.
Break and we'll be right back you have a.
Podcast yourself i do a podcast myself.
It's called the no chaser podcast uh-huh.
And it started off being like sex and.
Relationships but you know and got and.
That got a little old well you know you.
Can get old so you know i'm just gonna.
Talk about everything.
Yeah but get a very clear voice for us.
We're we're just everywhere yeah i mean.
You know it i try to keep a clear voice.
In some type of tone yeah you know i.
Think it helps but sometimes it's like.
You know we definitely had an episode a.
Couple weeks ago we're just talking.
About the emos random    and i love.
That episode but you know the thing.
About is i love talking about random.
Stuff yeah but you know for sure like.
For titles and getting people to click.
On it it helps that you know sexual.
Things that always helps that always.
Helps and people will be in the comments.
Complaining that you know do you only.
Talk about one thing all the time.
But then it's like those are the.
Episodes to get to most of you i know.
You know i'm saying and also like if you.
Watch the actual video the whole episode.
We're not just talking about that yeah.
You know that might be the title right.
But like shut up and watch it a lot of.
Times it's like it's the thing that's.
Most impressionable and it sticks with.
Them which is why they feel like oh.
There's the only thing you're talking.
Exactly but it just means like you guys.
Covered that topic so well and like.
There's no real holes in it so that's a.
Compliment in a way hey thanks man you.
Know you know i also feel like the whole.
Like sexual conversations specifically.
For like like in like the young.
Asian-americans growing up you know i.
Don't remember anybody that was like.
Asian and talking about stuff like that.
And that was a big reason why i made my.
Content so kind of like dirty in the.
Beginning because i was like i want to.
Be like from just the from the first.
Like clique i want to i want people to.
Be like oh this is not they this is not.
A stereotype you know and i was like and.
And and i first of all you know i i like.
Talking about dirty stuff you know i.
Enjoy butts and talking about butts and.
Stuff like that huh and but then i.
Remember you know when i was making my.
Youtube content i was like people were.
Already kind of shocked when they would.
Click on my rap videos you know cuz.
Growing up in in la and i feel like when.
You're in more diverse cities it's not.
Weird to see somebody that is asian and.
And and raps and like maybe like walks.
And and talks in a certain way but then.
When i was getting clicks from people.
Who were like you know i wouldn't even.
Be saying anything like on some gangster.
I would just have like a backwards.
Hat on and they're like this dude wants.
To be a gangster so bad and i remember.
Those comments for you what do you mean.
I'm literally just i'm chilling i'm just.
Wearing a backwards hat i'm just i'm you.
Know i'm rapping a little bit i'm not.
Saying oh nor do i claim to ever be a.
Gangster but for people that aren't used.
To that they are so just taken aback by.
It they don't know what to do so i was.
Like okay well let me do this - like i.
Like talking about dirty stuff i'm gonna.
Talk about dirty stuff i've never seen.
An asian dude talk about dirty stuff and.
I felt like for a whole generation of.
Young asian americans who.
Maybe necessarily didn't have anyone.
Older to talk to about that i kind of.
Became like um an older brother  uncle.
When they had questions like that you.
Know so when i was doing my dude.
Delegate oh stuff where they would send.
Me their relationship and sex questions.
That was one of the first things to.
Really kind of blow my channel up you.
Know cause like some of these kids that.
Used to watch me are now like dude you.
Know what i was watching you and i was.
13 years old i'm in college now you help.
Me get through high school like because.
You know they had they really had no one.
That they could talk to about that yeah.
Yeah i've gotten that comment or for.
Sure yeah crazy.
Well it's speaking of that it's pretty.
Funny cuz i was told i told my dad i was.
Like hey this weekend cuz he watches the.
Podcast all the time yeah i told him oh.
We have tim on and he's like oh he's.
Kind of crazy huh i was like no no and.
By that he means he's seen your stuff.
Yeah i was like no he's actually like.
He's a really cool guy like he's not.
Every everything when we talk is not.
Just like yeah like i did take sexuals.
Yeah cuz you know he goes by like oh he.
Sees your podcast title right oh they.
Know no he's very is very normal person.
It's like when people judge you by.
Like a couple youtube videos yes you.
Know especially you know especially.
Early youtube was so like hey guys.
What's up blah you know i'm saying jump.
Cuts and    it's like you want again.
You want to keep everything so.
Fast-paced and it's the tone is.
Completely changed now yeah but i.
Remember back then putting up content.
Like that and people meeting me that i.
Was just like having food with or.
Chilling with and they be like wow.
You're really calm i thought you were.
Gonna be annoying and i'm like no and.
I'm like that's me but i mean it's me.
Times 10 you know like real me isn't.
Always just yeah which is why i like the.
Whole podcast era right cuz it gives you.
A chance to actually chill and have a.
Conversation that's that's why i wanted.
To do it in the first place well when.
People when i first started it everybody.
Was like was ryan so depressed i was.
Just like no this is just how i am but.
Like when when i have to do a vlog i.
Just gotta turn it up a little bit you.
Know chug and extra energy at the time i.
Didn't have a ninja milk chug an extra -.
Red bulls you know ninja milk engine.
Thanks to him but yeah like people.
Thought and i don't blame them because.
That's all they've seen right unless.
They watch our second channel which is.
Behind the scenes button that's besides.
The point.
And they see you chilling and talking.
And exactly that we he's mad it's the.
Same thing and being conscious of your.
Face and stuff he's he's mad you know.
He's like he's not happy he's when i.
Used to watch back the vlogs when i used.
To edit them i would make sure that.
Every single clip every since split.
Second was if i looked a little bit mad.
He would comment on it so hmm.
I was calm this is me not being.
Conscious of my face right yeah and.
That's why people think i'm mad or sad i.
Don't know well you know the thing is.
And also you know i feel like your.
Audience is uh you know was really young.
At first they were yeah you need to.
Cater to that yeah i kind of stopped.
Well i mean shea we're old i know i know.
We are you guys audience is grown up you.
Know but also like you know youtube's.
Constantly the audiences are changing.
People are growing out of it new people.
Are coming in yeah um how have you guys.
Adjusted to that because you guys are.
Getting older you have new interests you.
Guys own the places which is something.
That you know kids are like i don't.
Understand anything about this you know.
I didn't understanding about it until.
Like a year ago when i bought the house.
That buying house is one of most.
Confusing things i've ever done it's a.
Lot of work yeah more than you think oh.
That's crazy.
You should the kids out there that we.
Eventually want to buy a house if you're.
In high school look into it a little bit.
Beforehand just you understand stuff you.
Have a realtor i did i did thank god or.
Else i would've been completely lost.
Yeah they don't teach you that    in.
School don't that's the stuff they.
Should be teaching kids exactly in high.
School dude when i was going through it.
I was like why was there not one class.
On buying a house or something or like.
Uh or a chapter in like you could have.
Got screwed over at any moment yeah in.
Your ear tour was a bad person i was.
Signing things i was just like okay yeah.
I know my rotor so it was like fortunate.
For me but i couldn't even i knew.
Nothing.
Yeah same boat as my parents for.
Everything i was literally just like oh.
Just tell me just tell me what's a sign.
You know you don't even own the place.
But yeah in terms of getting older yeah.
It's been a long time we've been on.
Youtube just about same amount of time.
Yeah yeah like 13 i started little after.
So six okay okay yeah oh six.
Yeah same so it's like in 13 years.
Almost 14 years yep and i'm always kind.
Of i feel fortunate that my audience.
Grew with me you know because i feel.
Like you know we've we've seen people.
And channels that were really popping.
And maybe they were doing one specific.
Type of thing for a long time and maybe.
They were catering to a specific.
Audience and then you know that only.
Worked for so long before people are.
Like you know i've outgrown this you.
Know so the fact that people you know.
Still tuned in as much as they do i'm.
Like huh oh thank god that's crazy.
Of course it's not the same like it used.
To be yeah how about you you how's your.
Audience you feel like they've been with.
You it's i i would say for sure.
Cuz i've seen it like the age ranges.
Obviously it's hard to say in the.
Beginning because it's 13 to 17 but.
Really that means 13 in under mmm.
Because you weren't allowed to make.
Accounts back then right and for the.
Longest time it was slowly starting to.
Go up and i was trying to force myself.
To get back down there because that's.
Where the biggest group is so i would.
Say and i just talked about in one of my.
Videos but like i used to try so hard to.
Cater to that group and getting the.
Young ones coming in that i would have.
To dumb down the content hmm and take.
Jokes that i thought was funny and kill.
Them for myself.
Make it good for other people yeah and i.
Used to hurt like it literally hurt me.
And i would see it that's so funny.
Because it i had the same thing happen.
To me but in a completely different way.
Because of course i never catered to a.
Younger audience i was always just kind.
Of out there yes stuff right but where.
Where that happened to me was you know.
Of course you know a lot like a lot of.
My skits were kind of dirty kind of like.
Slapstick ii in the beginning and um but.
Personally like the type of stuff i like.
To watch is like way drier like weird.
Almost you know and so when i'm like i.
Really want to make some content that i.
Would watch i'm like audience isn't.
Gonna get this they're not gonna like.
This i think we're very similar one of.
The funniest videos i think i've seen of.
Yours was just you and that dude dance.
And just rain yeah.
That's my favorite video but i never.
Done i can see if like like that stuff's.
Funny to me but if i were to post.
Something that i would get it would not.
Work.
Yeah but that did okay for you that did.
Great for me and but that was one of the.
Ones i was nervous about yes i was like.
But that was also a video that i was so.
Proud of to be a part of the house i.
Don't care if they like this or not.
Yeah and luckily they loved it you know.
But you know that that's definitely out.
Of you know in my mind like kind of.
Range of content it's like it's one of.
The special ones oh yeah what's that.
Dude same just rain just rain just ran.
Yeah.
Should i just learned that you're not.
Supposed to call people indian what.
Ethnicity is he he's indian oh no okay.
Well i just learned why people are.
Called indians native american people.
Are quiet indians but there's a i used.
To mix up the two.
I think that guys actually end you know.
I know yeah but what i mean is like i.
Didn't want to say either because i.
Didn't want to mess up just in case yeah.
And i used to get mixed up the two and i.
Just i just learned about the whole.
History i'm very ignorant but like i.
Mean i want to learn so i watch things.
In that that's what i learned i'm i have.
To be very careful when i speak that so.
I don't tweet a lot because i'm always.
Scared to get cancelled right um let's.
Talk about that you guys are from an.
Older generation of social media where.
You know there's a lot of things said.
That you know potentially be like whoa.
Whoa whoa these before you know yeah i'm.
Surprised you're nothing you've said has.
Gotten you into trouble really not you.
Know what it's like look for sure there.
Is content that i put out in the past.
That wouldn't put out now right like.
Stuff i wasn't a lean guy and i might.
Have private a couple videos just with.
The change of the times you know and and.
And i also understood.
Like i of course cancel culture as a.
Comedian is like it's annoying right but.
I also understand that the like the just.
Society is maturing and growing you feel.
Me it's like things are different.
And that is okay and i'm not mad at that.
So there are definite like and i feel.
Like back on twitter especially there.
Was kind of a thing where you were.
Trying like people are people are trying.
To be edgy like you would say just crazy.
Just to like get real yeah get.
Retweets and get laughs because you know.
Like it was like who cares it's twitter.
You know and i've definitely gone into.
My past.
Tweets done a little search i mean like.
You know i wanna just delete a whole.
Bunch of these because i don't in ones.
That weren't even bad but it was just.
Like words that were kind of like um.
Like like anything that came up that was.
Like even like specific you know if it.
Was like oh um i met this cool black.
Woman today.
I'm like let me just delete black woman.
Just in case anyone wants to go you know.
Find some issue with this they don't see.
Eye to eye i don't agree with that i.
Feel like that i i am mad at cancer.
Culture because i think i think that's.
Ridiculous like yeah even it's.
Especially if it's a long time ago and.
Let's say there's stuff you wouldn't say.
Now right if you found a video that you.
Deleted and someone reuploaded and they.
Decided to cancer you for that i'd be.
Pissed i'll be like this isn't right.
Even if unless you were like i stand by.
It right you know i get it but like i.
Don't think i think there's this mob.
Mentality that happens and that's that's.
The difference if someone can say.
Something offensive and the people.
Offended should be offended but it.
Doesn't mean everyone needs to be.
Offended and agree with the offended.
People no i totally agree i totally.
Agree and i think everyone has the right.
To be offended yep i think i i people.
Shouldn't feel obligated to agree with.
You if you're offended and i totally.
Agree with that.
But at the same time i'm like i'm still.
Gonna delete these tweets oh yeah i mean.
Like don't why take the risk right right.
Yeah because i mean that's the stupid.
Part look like i said i'm not mad at the.
Fact that things that we said back then.
Maybe aren't as acceptable now yeah but.
I am mad at mob mentality and the fact.
That people are mad at you for something.
You said 10 years ago because or that.
They want to cancel you for that because.
It's like what like look you had to have.
Been asleep before you can be woke you.
Don't say and so how you gonna be like.
Mad at me when i was sleep like i was.
Sleep yes.
How are you gonna be mad at me for that.
I didn't know what's going on i was.
Sleep yeah and i'm and all i'm saying is.
Right now all the people who are.
Currently quote unquote woke how do they.
Know that everything they're doing right.
Now 10 years from now isn't asleep yeah.
You know so uh it's it's one thing to be.
Upset by something in the time like okay.
I get it i wouldn't say certain things i.
Would say i would have said like ten.
Years ago right but how do you know that.
What you're saying right now isn't gonna.
Be a friends of ten years from now.
I mean exactly and the thing about it is.
Like men even five years ago it's like i.
Feel like you your mind and everything.
Can grow so much you can become a.
Completely different person you know so.
I it's it's silly to hold that over.
Someone's head forever.
Yeah i agree yeah and a lot of times i.
Think it's especially with social media.
Um you feel so isolated and not like.
Real connections but you want to feel.
Like a part of something bigger mm-hmm.
So a lot of times a lot of people in.
These mom mentalities are this walk.
Mentality they don't even really truly.
Believe it they're just like i'm just.
Saying what i think i'm supposed to.
Because everybody else is doing it.
Mm-hmm you know any gets likes yeah like.
That and it's which is the ironic then.
You feel a part of it yeah so that's the.
New culture and i think people are.
Trying to fit in for one and it's the.
Majority so it's easier you're right to.
Jump on that bandwagon i think it's.
Gonna switch eventually because people.
Are getting tired of that i think it's.
Already starting to happen you see.
Comments like the people are kind of.
Getting sick of it they're over it yeah.
But i think another part of that mob.
Mentality is the fact that there's just.
A internet culture there's i don't know.
What it is there's like people who just.
Like to make people feel worse and i.
Think part of it is because they're not.
Happy so they want other people to feel.
That pain mm-hmm because they maybe they.
Got called out for something so now.
They're like okay you know what you're.
Coming yeah i'm gonna call out other.
People to make them worse i might just.
Maybe be in my head i don't know that's.
A theory i have i mean you know it's.
It's so it's it's crazy that it's gotten.
To a point like that i just you know i.
Just i just want i want to be a better.
Person.
Yeah and it's like if i want to be a.
Better person.
Then then let me make my mistakes you.
Know and and i'm sure like eventually.
You know there's gonna be something that.
Like happen in the past that like people.
Are gonna be upset about you know it's.
And that's i mean i mean we all like.
Sade and do dumb things when we're young.
And growing yeah you know figuring it.
Out well like the indian thing like i.
Just like i said i used to call native.
American b-boy and i didn't know the.
Difference i didn't know why that.
Happened.
Apparently it's because when people.
First came here they thought they were.
In india i know this is true yeah and.
Then they just stopped just kept calling.
Them indians so i didn't know how.
Offensive that was but when you when you.
Watch cartoons and stuff i know you.
Associate that's like i grew up learning.
From cartoons and stuff right in history.
Class i mean i guess i didn't pay.
Attention to well and then you know i.
Mean and in cartoons they're playing.
Cowboys and indians yeah exactly.
Actually you would let's it that because.
That just happened right columbus day.
It just happened did it recently i.
Believe that i don't know yeah but a lot.
Of people are talking about you know.
Columbus day and or should it be called.
Indigenous indigenous peoples day yeah.
Changing it up cuz everyone likes there.
Everyone's like yo christopher columbus.
Shouldn't be celebrated anymore he did.
He didn't even really find america and.
He just really just kind of what he did.
To the people actually because uh you.
Know he was like i'll trade like certain.
Objects for land and the native.
Americans were like you can't own land.
Sure like this is a good idea for us and.
So when they got this up and then you.
Know he started to enact oh we own this.
Or we we do this and then indian people.
Or sorry native american people see your.
Cancelled bro a native american people.
They they they taught him certain things.
How to do certain stuff and then what he.
Did was enslave them you know and so a.
Lot of people are like wait a minute.
This isn't right we've been celebrating.
Somebody who has persecuted people who.
Previously owned this land right so.
That's the whole contract i didn't know.
Its own digitus people's day no way see.
That's another thing too what you back.
To noah lumbus lover bullet clip from.
This exact exactly they could and i was.
Just i didn't know yeah they say like oh.
He's so ignorant but like that's how you.
Learn yeah exactly you have to learn at.
Some point and there should be some not.
Like you don't need credit for it but.
Like i just show like i'm not closed off.
Right to say like oh no i know.
Christopher columbus and that's why.
Columbus christopher colombo that and.
That's why i don't like the whole like.
If someone's ignorant like you get angry.
At them for not knowing.
I mean if someone's ignorant and and.
They have questions let's help each.
Other out you know you know some people.
Though you know there are they're like.
If the kid touches the stove and burns.
Themselves they should know you know and.
Some people are like oh no you know what.
Let's teach him but you don't know the.
Temperature of a native american person.
I don't know how hot until the the white.
People brought over the flu then they.
Probably had a fever yeah see whities.
Man messed it all up that's another.
Thing i don't even bring that up.
Ooh now i want to know but we can.
Transition out yeah we can transition.
Out we have 10 minutes left let's go to.
A couple of the bigger questions.
Questions yeah i have like one or two.
Sure mister um but actually one that i.
Wanted to talk about is because you are.
One of the first prominent youtubers to.
Be in a long-distance relationship oh.
That has actually panned out yeah yeah.
So i don't know if you want to talk.
About it a little bit about this cuz you.
Know especially again with social media.
Because a lot of you were like oh i can.
Find love anywhere right right but.
There's a whole like subtle asian dating.
Thing where people finding love across.
The country across the world yeah.
There's apps all over.
What advice cuz we've already asked ryan.
About this but you know you have a.
Completely different story so let's just.
Hear about that a little yeah i mean um.
You know what i when i was younger i.
Would have never said i would get into a.
Long-distance relationship you know i.
Used to be like you know what i couldn't.
Do it i need like just to touch somebody.
You're horny we've got my one boy i was.
A horny boy yeah still am but when i met.
Gia my my wife my current wife my only.
Wife i remember thinking like if i don't.
At least try to make this work then i'm.
Just.
Regret it forever you know and and.
Long-distance you know it's possible.
It's just it's not it's not easy and i.
Think it takes very specific kinds of.
People for me like let's say i was with.
A long-distance relationship with my ex.
Okay who at the time like needed to talk.
On the phone all the time needed to know.
Where i was and and if i was trying to.
Do that with her long-distance with her.
That would have never worked but with.
Chea not only is she a super secure.
Person like isn't jealous isn't like.
Where you add who you with she also was.
Really busy you know i'm saying she ran.
Her own business in canada so it was.
Like we both had our own stuff going on.
So it wasn't somebody or - yeah it's.
Really important because if one person.
Is busy all the time and they can't text.
Back and they can't call back the other.
Person is like what's happening you know.
Their life kind of gets revolved around.
The other person and like and and that's.
Not good for even a regular relationship.
You know and so what worked for us is.
Like she could worry about her own thing.
I could worry about my own thing we were.
Both super secure people no one was like.
Tripping about like why aren't you.
Hitting me back you know and and and.
Also and this is a big thing in longest.
Relationships ooh is that like um we.
Both had money yeah we could both afford.
To fly back and forth to canada when we.
Needed to and she also she ran her own.
Business so she could leave whenever she.
Wanted to that is huge yeah dude so it.
Wasn't like you know cuz some people are.
In long dissipation ships they can't.
Take the time off of work for like six.
Months right but we were we had a system.
Where we would work work work for three.
Weeks i would shoot i'll go on meetings.
She would do all like her appointments.
For three weeks she was an aesthetician.
Pedicures manicures waxing vaginas we do.
That for three weeks straight we'd set.
One week where i wouldn't take any.
Business and she wouldn't take any.
Clients we'd fly to each other and hang.
Out for a week and then be like alright.
See you next month you know and um it.
Was hard at first first couple months it.
Was like you know crying at the airport.
And    like that but after after a few.
Months i was like alright well uh see.
You next month.
You know have have a good trip and um.
Just coming out used to it how long ago.
Did you get married a year ago.
Oh so it's oh that that's way more.
Recent than i thought.
Is uh so that's that's during a time.
Where immigration is a big thing is she.
Is us citizen now dude that whole.
Process was a    it's booked for ever.
I would assume right now in like the.
Past four years three years she.
Literally just got her green card like.
Two weeks ago oh really and it was over.
A year no dude not only that yeah i'm.
Talking about from the beginning process.
Of trying to get her k1 visa which was.
The proper visa to get to get married.
It's the fiance visa where she enters.
The country and has 90 days to marry me.
Legally this is all we're doing.
Everything the super proper way from the.
Day we applied for that visa to the day.
We got it it got married and since she.
Got married like we've done a couple we.
She did an interview i did an interview.
The whole approval process took like two.
Years yeah that is crazy yeah and and.
And here's what happened to while she.
Was married while after we got married.
She wasn't allowed to leave the country.
Or work she couldn't even go back to.
Canada for like a straight year yeah she.
Could even visit her family it was crazy.
Yeah that seems i mean that i guess in a.
Way that shows true love because if you.
Guys really didn't love each other you.
Wouldn't go through that    you.
Know it was like and he was 22 his is um.
You know when we kind of got into our.
Long-distance routine at one point i was.
Like hey babe is this weird but do you.
Almost think it's better that we're.
Long-distance and she was like babe i.
Was thinking the exact same thing.
Because she loves her alone time i love.
My alone time she was working so hard.
And it was like dude who i don't even.
Think we would have had time for a.
Relationship if we were together like.
That so how was it different now then.
Well now we've taken all those skills.
And apply them to living together you.
Know because like now that we've gone.
Through all that nobody's mad when.
Someone's like just in the other room.
For like the whole thing like we can be.
Yeah we can be chillin not even talking.
To each other and.
It's not an issue you know no one's like.
Needy yeah you know and being to people.
That really value they're kind of like.
Space and a lone time i think the.
Distance helped us get into a space.
Where it's like okay i understand that.
This is you need to be here i need to be.
Here sometimes if i'm snoring too much i.
Will move to the next bed because she's.
Like pushing me my face cuz she can't.
Sleep that's something she had to get.
Used to like me snoring apparently i.
Snore and but yeah it worked we got.
Married yeah that's not good.
Thanks not bad and i guess we can.
Continue into another question from.
Caesar that ass what do you believe to.
Be the key to happiness cuz you're.
Somebody who always promotes that type.
Of stuff i know there's a lot of keys.
You have you have more keys than a.
Janitor more keys than i have two keys i.
Have two key or that i try to apply to.
My life all the time one being like i.
Said before the more you care about what.
Other people think i think the more you.
The more you like cut yourself off.
From like potential happiness you know.
Cuz you're you're leaving your life.
According to other people's opinions.
Like you give them the power instead of.
Having own power exactly like once you.
Stop caring then it's like you're free.
You know it's like who cares the second.
Thing i always try to apply in my life.
Is something i learned in like a taoism.
Class in college which but but then.
People like so many people have said.
This in so many different ways and it's.
That um life isn't about what happens to.
You it's about how you react to what.
Happens to you you know it's like once.
You realize that you don't control.
Anything and you stop worrying about it.
And you're just kind of like okay i'm.
Just gonna make the most out of whatever.
Situations i'm dealt then it's like okay.
Cool i'm just gonna take this and roll.
With it and and and try to do my best.
And then you know you just you're okay.
With it i think nice yeah very clear.
Concise stuff.
This table is of will smith he thinks to.
Not let things happen to you but you.
Control the universe is that he says.
Something like that like you can make.
Force to universe to ben there's a lot.
Of people yeah who believe like.
Manifesting disks it's a similar thing.
No i mean i'm here's the thing i mean i.
Totally believe in the universe too.
Like okay like it exists oh yeah it's.
All exist but when people used to ask me.
What i wanted to be when i grow up.
Whenever they asked me what did you.
Think.
Did you ever think you would end up here.
Now i'm like yeah this is what i wanted.
To do like i didn't know in what.
Capacity but one night when they asked.
Me i was little i'd say oh yeah i'm.
Gonna be famous cuz i knew what i wanted.
To do and i knew that if i kept working.
Towards that goal i would make it happen.
You know and whenever people asked me.
Like how does it feel to like live your.
Dream i always tell them like well.
Here's the thing i never looked at it.
Okay here's here's another here's i've.
Said this a million times in my videos.
But but this is ryan higa the audience.
So i always say hey what do i say don't.
Look at your goals as dreams look at.
Them as destinations okay because for me.
When you think of dreams you think of.
Like like unicorns something that's like.
That's not tangible you know but if you.
Look at your goal as something that that.
Is there as a destination and all you.
Have to do is keep moving towards it.
Then you'll get there eventually you.
Know and and i feel like i looked at.
Like being famous the same way somebody.
Would look at getting like a college.
Degree or getting like a becoming a.
Doctor you know like you know what the.
End goal is so you go okay i'm gonna go.
Take biology class and go be pre-med i'm.
Gonna be a nurse i'm gonna take all.
These steps that eventually make me a.
Doctor so for me i was like i know where.
I want to be in my career i'm gonna take.
The necessary steps and you know get an.
Agent and go take acting classes and and.
Even though i haven't done that but but.
Put myself in the right positions and.
Take the right steps so i feel like if i.
Just keep going i'll only keep.
