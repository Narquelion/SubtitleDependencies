Hey guys so growing up i was a huge game.
I know i know it's hard to believe being.
That i was a very skinny small nerdy.
Asian kid growing up but really i was a.
Big game i mean every single free second.
That i had i was either on a gaming.
Console or a computer or a gameboy of.
Some sort i would say about 50% of my.
Childhood was me playing video games 25%.
Was playing sports the other 25% was.
Making videos and the last remaining 5%.
Was me neglecting my math homework.
Don't get me wrong i definitely don't.
Play as many video games as i used to.
Because you know i'm not a kid anymore.
I'm a mature adult so anyway if you play.
Or played as many video games as i did.
You've definitely heard this before it's.
One of the most irritating things you.
Could ever hear as a gamer why are you.
Wasting your time if you know if you.
Have something like that in your life.
Get rid of them not because what they.
Say they're what that voice is so.
Irritating usually coming from your.
Parents or girls i'm not trying to be.
Sexist i know a lot of girls play video.
Games too but let's be real it's more.
Guys it's it's a fact although there's a.
Lot of guys that will question your.
Video game playing too but i mean those.
Are just losers that don't play video.
Games because they have no lives right.
Guys there are three main reasons why i.
Think people say that video games are.
Always the time one they're not good at.
Them so they don't like playing that -.
They like playing them but they have no.
Time so they don't want you to either or.
The worst of all three they judge you.
Because you have an interest in.
Something that they have no interest in.
Which is so judgmental and makes.
Absolutely no sense to me that's like.
Saying hey mom why do you paint your.
Nails that's always a timer hey dad why.
Do you watch football and that's a waste.
Of time or hey or no that's a great show.
I missed that show feel better now if.
You get the point i actually believe.
That video games are good for kids or.
Anyone we do games aren't a waste of.
Time they're good for you they teach a.
Life lesson and i think it's about time.
That our society starts to appreciate.
That for all the gamers the geeks the.
Nerds the so-called losers i'm standing.
Up for you the next time somebody says.
Gaming is a waste of time like a friend.
Or a parent or a boyfriend or girlfriend.
Probably not the last two because you're.
A nerd haha i'm gonna stand up for you.
And let them know the truth and tell.
Them all the reasons why i'm so close to.
The camera i'm out of focus all the.
Reasons why.
Gaming is actually good.
First let me start off with the most.
Obvious one hand-eye coordination a lot.
Of video games required quick reflexes.
Especially first-person shooters like.
Conor strong gears of war halos modern.
Warfare attica i can't think of a better.
Way to teach hand-eye coordination i.
Mean how else would i be able to do.
Something like this candy too easy ah.
Problem solved if you don't run into any.
Difficult and it's just like life if.
Your life has no problems you're not.
Really living it that is deep i just.
Mean that oh that is a straight-up.
Annoying person's caption for their.
Selfie on instagram anyway i'm off.
Talking both videogames and life you're.
Gonna run into problems a true gamer.
Never gives up problem solves until he.
Figures out how to win trial and error.
Looking for patterns keeping a 10 - he.
Gets better and better for example in.
Real life if you're taking a calculus.
Class at you're failing for you like a.
Video game try to problem solve never.
Give up and eventually you will succeed.
If you know you're not ready and you.
Can't beat that level then lower the.
Difficulty take ceramics camping don't.
Be a camp for all you gamers out there.
You already know in a camper but for.
Those of you that don't a kaffir is.
Basically someone that will wait around.
And hide and so their victims come to.
Them rather than actually playing the.
Actual game this is such an important.
Life lesson.
Yeah sure be a camper and enjoy the safe.
Route hide behind a bush or a couch your.
Whole life but if you want to have an.
Exciting life don't just be a camper who.
Just waits around to opportunity come.
See it's not just lame to people it's.
Irritating you get out there and you get.
Go after what you want in life helping.
Is boring rice storm the front go go go.
Counter-strike references hackers.
Hackers aren't respected sure it give me.
A hacker in life and cheat your way to.
The top you and everyone else around you.
Knows that you have to get there and the.
Thing is technology is so good now that.
If you're hacking you're gonna get.
Caught dare i say it.
And so we'll make her dance bands but.
Good day.
Nobody likes a rage quitter you know.
Those guys they quit the game out of.
Frustration go go go settle quit if you.
Play games especially online you know.
The feeling of wanting to rage quit.
Don't even lie and as irritating as a.
Rage quit or is it still teaches you a.
Life lesson sometimes you get so upset.
And frustrated that you just have to.
Stop when you're in a place in life when.
You're so unhappy with the way things.
Are going take a break take some time to.
Cool off and come back even stronger.
Money management whether it's coins.
Dollars minerals or whatever video game.
Seats you want to spend it whines for.
Example if you're gonna buy a knob you.
Have to member to save money for ammo.
Because that was pretty expensive not to.
Mention your secondary weapon like a.
Diigo or something and we'd even get to.
The part about the equipment like your.
Caliper and he'll made your frag grenade.
Your double flash bangs andor smoke.
Grenade and stun damn i really am in.
There if you get any of those references.
You're awesome micromanage when you have.
A bunch of units you don't just auto.
Attack like some new you assign.
Different units to do different things.
Yet another life lesson each person has.
Their own specific purpose micromanage.
Each person to do what they're best at.
That's efficiency by all and every.
First-person shooter will teach you that.
You're more likely to die if you get.
Shot in the head than the arm or the leg.
Okay maybe that one might seem obvious.
But if you think about it it's probably.
Obvious because you learned that from a.
Video game or a movies trula if you get.
Shot in the head gg bro multiplayer to.
Me this is one of the most valuable life.
Lessons you can learn from video games.
Most if not all video games these days.
Are multiple multiplayer teaches you.
That if you have a bad team and you.
Don't work together you're probably.
Gonna lose you can't always do.
Everything by yourself the bottom line.
Is there's no i in the spelling of.
Teamwork just like there's no i in the.
Spelling of multiplayer with the bottom.
Line there it is and the sooner you.
Learn that the sooner we can all work.
Together like a multiplayer unit and.
Convince people that video games aren't.
Always the time new games are important.
To teaching people how to really start.
Living life by not setting up camp but.
Going after the things they really want.
Without having to cheat their way to the.
Top even if they have to rage quit every.
Now and then they learn to problem-solve.
And never give up until they get there.
And once they do they'll already have.
Past any problems that come along their.
Way with the quickest reflexes the world.
Has ever seen because gaming is more.
Than just a game its life and like i.
Always said since i was a little kid.
Your life has no problems you're not.
Really playing the.
Wait if life has no problems the game is.
Not really playing the lute life what.
When the life is a problem games our.
Problem is life is a game the problem is.
If your game has problems to get back to.
The store that you got it from life is.
Like a xbox or chocolates.
Okay if your life has no problems you're.
Not really living in and that is the.
Bottom line.
Son of a i quit i quit hey guys thank.
