Oh really i never realized how expensive.
Weddings are for me i always see life as.
Like something that you can look back on.
And remember and those you're only gonna.
Remember certain things when i got.
Punched like a chunk of my jaw line got.
Taken out alright clapping claps welcome.
Back to another episode of off the bill.
Podcast today we don't have a guest well.
Technically we do cuz greg's not always.
Here but you know what's going on great.
Just be honest and say we have to intro.
This three times because we keep end up.
Laughing and talking about nothing this.
Episode i can't wait till we start doing.
This live what's up i'm paco by the way.
Oh you're not.
We got paco in the moderator seat greg's.
Across from me and we are going back to.
Our roots and we don't have a guest.
Really and we're just gonna be talking.
About the things that we want to be.
Talking about let's talk there's no real.
Topics but also we have nobody helping.
Us pay the bills no sponsors today so.
Sponsors into that walmart.com slash.
Ninja milk thanks to go there right now.
People ask you know people ask it's been.
Artists talk in a lot of places.
I know it's doing very well well not in.
Those like those places that are they're.
Out of stock is where i have the most.
Feds so like it really sucks anyway if.
It's not there just go to our site ninja.
Muqaam but uh yeah it sucks that they.
Were out of stock because walmart bought.
A whole bunch for me so we're like.
Running a little anyway we made a second.
Batch so that's our sponsor for today's.
Podcast because we don't have a sponsor.
Yeah but you can be the next one yep.
What were you saying we're just talking.
About like what's going on with our.
Lives and stuff well you just did.
Something with jk news for people who.
Don't know bart and joe originally yes.
Right yet they were just kidding films.
Just them too and then they transitioned.
And they made like multiple channels.
Just getting party everything a podcast.
Yeah it's it's kind of like a podcast in.
A way it's like twelve minutes of news.
But it's not necessarily focused around.
The news it's just like then just.
Discussing it and then sometimes stories.
Will pop out it was a really fun.
Experience with them.
It's basically us except they have their.
Like prepared yeah and their more vulgar.
Their little more they're a lot more uh.
They're not afraid to say things whereas.
Sometimes ryan will be like probably.
Shouldn't dip my toes into that water.
Yeah i need to work on that i feel like.
Jo and bart are people that should be on.
The podcast soon they want you oh yeah.
Oh you mean on ours yeah yeah on ours.
But they also want you on theirs but.
You're not gonna be as good as me that's.
How i was out i mean i don't think i am.
Good at that that's why i brought you on.
This in the first place.
Because you're just a talker you know i.
Mean like i had one of the reason i.
Started doing this podcast is because i.
Wanted to get better at doing this well.
You've improved over these bascomb.
Yeah i thought so too yeah well you know.
Because one of my biggest fears if you.
Go back and watch like back from like.
2000 actually has early 2000 when i.
Started doing this and then like not not.
The podcast like youtube in general.
Every single interview i do i'm hella.
Awkward and i just hate doing i mean i.
Hate public speaking and i hate just.
Doing things.
Um that's live i guess and being.
Recorded that i don't have control over.
Because i i just my biggest thing is i.
Lose track of my train of thought.
Mm-hmm i even like when i take adderall.
I like i don't have any.
I still get those moments of just like.
My mind wanders if someone's talking and.
I'm not like super excited about it i.
Don't try to like i really try to pay.
Attention but i can't anyway that's.
That's one of the reasons why i want to.
Do this because we are just uh you know.
Trying to get better at our week you.
Guys have been getting better it's.
Definitely something that i've been.
Trying to the same way then listen to as.
Much as i can for you guys like you know.
All the podcasts i don't listen to it.
That much but every time i do did you.
Listen to us yeah i do i know when he.
Does i mean it's like it's like a lot of.
People it's like select yeah this is a.
Oh i guess you care about or the the.
Good window i really like the one that.
You guys it with though with the chang.
Qu yang oh.
Oh change yo whoops yeah the window with.
Yang was up you clearly paid attention.
During that one yeah that was a good one.
Like i learned a lot from them and i.
Think for me the reason why i mean i.
Liked it is because i literally was like.
Those are my real questions that i.
Always asked it you don't get to.
Normally have those things answered from.
Someone you know right you don't have.
The opportunity to have that person.
There yeah he definitely dropped a lot.
Of information on us that was kind of.
Like i mean it is gonna be a little.
Biased because it is coming from you.
Know his campaign his perspective stuff.
Like that but nonetheless i mean what.
You see also in the news is kind of.
Reflecting what he talks about i don't.
Know if you guys saw though but they.
Were talking about in terms of who's.
Raising the most money he actually.
Raised like a decent amount but even.
Then news networks are not putting his.
Like he's raising more than some people.
On those news networks and they're not.
Showing him like that so that's.
Interesting there's i mean that's been.
Like the narrative from like months ago.
Right like he's coming out of nowhere.
And they keep there's all these like.
There's like it's not really a.
Conspiracy cuz it's actually happening.
Like there's so many things.
Coincidentally that that goes against.
The mainstream media is doing against.
Andrew yang so for whatever reason he's.
Being targeted i think to a certain.
Degree and i guess if you just look it.
Up you can you can see like people have.
Made videos of him like proof race it's.
Happening and i'm not sure why and maybe.
It could be because he's the only one.
That's not a politician could be that.
Crazy.
Yeah same way of that i guess in the.
Same way he's kind of like donald trump.
Should i say that like but the way like.
He's not a politician it just came in.
Here and took people by storm maybe.
They're afraid that he'll he'll actually.
What if that's the route though for like.
The next presidency is like someone who.
Isn't a politician who isn't playing by.
Those rules i think was formed i think.
That's true like i think that's why.
They're trying to not show him because.
They want they want somebody who's that.
They're used to in there that will be.
Conformed will conform to lobbyists and.
Stuff like that mm-hmm.
Or it's just because he's asian could be.
Ya know i mean you know they're making.
Big jumps but he's.
That's a big too big of a jump yes maybe.
Maybe the reason to not stir away too.
Far but still talking about you know.
Presidential politics and opinions on.
Things something that recently popped up.
That ryan and i both picked as a good.
Topic was the obama vs. woke culture.
Exchange i was shocked.
Yes all that video you want to explain.
Why amin well i'll take that back i.
Wasn't shocked i was just shocked that.
They that he said that publicly so.
Basically obama there's a video of him.
Was he at a q&a or something it was.
Chicago yeah doing he was doing a speech.
I think it was for something for him let.
Me look it up as you talk uh-huh so he.
Was giving some speech or whatever i.
Would just watch the video i didn't see.
The full whatever thing he was doing any.
Kind of like went out against like.
Cancer culture sorry woke obama dude.
Yeah not really not really against it he.
Just showed he gave a different opinion.
Um from what you're used to seeing from.
One side like from the left party which.
Is like they're usually very pro being.
Woke and and being you know canceling.
People who have done the wrong things in.
The past and he was basically not saying.
He wasn't going against it completely.
But he kind of gave his opinion and he.
Said we can't everybody makes mistakes.
The exact argument that a lot of people.
Make when they mess up it was coming.
From him though so it was like very.
Strange because he's cancelled for.
Something that's what i'm there.
Something like what's coming up that.
Someone has dirt on him for or like.
Nothing that i've seen so far on the.
News but basically he was speaking at an.
Obama foundation summit in chicago on.
Tuesday where he spoke out and asked for.
Americans to like abandon ideologically.
Pure ideal ideological purity test set.
His quote in politics no it's a this is.
An article that's quoting him but his.
Quote was that this idea of purity and.
You're never compromised and you're.
Always politically woke and all that.
Stuff you should get over that quickly.
He said the world is messy there are.
Ambiguities people who do really good.
Stuff have flaws yeah and that's so true.
Like.
But now coming from obama that's and.
He's again it's always been like you.
Know i mean you hear people on the right.
And they're also saying things contrary.
To that but it's almost like they go so.
Far and above it's like it became this.
Like extreme vers extreme yeah that's.
Someone who's finally like kind of in.
The middle yeah you know it's like and i.
Feel like a lot of times - a lot of.
People who do speak out are the.
Extremists where most of america.
Probably sits somewhere in central you.
Know like they'll lean to a side but.
Because it's so extremists on both sides.
You're afraid of like oh if i speak out.
And be like well the other side does.
Have good points like what about this.
Then your own side will be like oh.
You're betraying this you know you don't.
Truly believe us you should just be with.
Them and right it's so polarizing you.
Know i thought it was just great cuz.
Like we got even like we talked about it.
A little bit too much i think here and.
We're talking about it again about like.
Cancer culture and how much i hate it.
Even with the last august with tim i was.
Talking about like he was like i can.
Understand it like he was trying but i.
Was like i don't i'm pissed and i don't.
Like it but just even having saying that.
There's negativity towards me and saying.
Why why that it's necessary to that that.
Happens you know that people do get.
Counsel for doing these things because.
It's a necessary sacrifice for the good.
Of humanity and i think the initial.
Cortical cancellations were important.
You know like harvey weinstein like.
People who have been doing terrible.
Stuff for a long time and then it got to.
The point where this monster just grew.
And was like fetus more fetus more and.
No matter what they did they just wanted.
Sacrifices and it became its own.
Religion and cult in a way if you think.
About it yeah well canceling people you.
Mean yeah yeah and i think that kind of.
Bread the whole and again the divide.
Happened right it kind of bread the.
Whole anti-cancer asian culture so.
Canceling cancellation culture.
We're like people were so annoyed.
Including myself not that i would do.
That speak out i get like people who.
Deserve to be canceled should be.
Cancelled yeah but i think somewhere.
Along the lines we lost that you know.
Where do we draw that line and then.
People were so annoyed by you know.
The whole kevin hart situation or dave.
Chappelle's you know thing people are so.
Annoyed by it that they went to the.
Extreme like almost troll level off just.
Like canceling every but like going.
Against council culture in every single.
Way and i think that's yeah i mean i.
Don't i don't know i hate talking about.
This cuz like it's just gonna draw more.
Of those same people we're gonna anyway.
Whatever what are you excited about.
Right now greg what's going on right now.
They tricks it we can talk about.
Whatever we want whoa ninja milk.
Stop-motion is done yato now my focus is.
On my wedding okay.
And this is something that a lot of.
People have kind of like i don't think.
There was any like real announcement.
Announcement at least on this john.
Additional yeah yeah i mean that dana.
Had a ring but greg and dana.
Go ahead i mean you can say like you.
Guys are engaged you just said it so.
Like yeah greg and dana are engaged so.
What happened was i was supposed to make.
Like this crazy video because i had this.
Thing all planned out it was super cool.
In my mind but yeah my proposed oh let's.
Just say it was it was cute but the.
Execution was audio you said he had.
Issues right well the video was horrible.
Yeah the video is horrible but the way i.
Did it was like you know i was supposed.
To propose to her with like like legos.
Me and her are both in trillions of.
Legos and i made this cool little lego.
Thing and it broke when i gave it to her.
I was trying to put it together wow.
Stuttering and mumbling all sweating.
Anyway i'll make a video of it i can i.
Think and make a good video of it just.
Wait for that but that's honestly more.
Like that's like everyone sees those.
Videos where everything is like super.
Planned and romantic and like that's.
Like s'more you you know like that's you.
Guys that's like i mean i know it's.
Always been fun industry but like that's.
Like it's the epitome of your.
Relationship i feel like i mean from my.
Perspective i feel like that that's.
Almost even better that it ended up that.
Way.
I think so instead the footage though.
It's it's of you like breaking in and.
Then panicking and yeah yeah yep i think.
That's better i don't know it's pretty.
Funny it's really cute but yeah me and.
Dana are getting married.
Yep next year sometime in october you.
Guys are invited.
What oh realize how expensive weddings.
Are yep wow i my brother just got.
Married too so just when they were.
Talking about they did it in a different.
Way only went destination and then there.
Was actually you were there you're.
Filming it there was only like ten of us.
Right give or take.
And that way they could just have fun.
Right but you're doing a little bit.
Different the tradition oi yeah my.
Family is give us some own family in a.
Way in filipino so it's being yeah but.
It's just my family never really had a.
Big wedding.
In or at least in my immediate family we.
Recently had something smaller but we.
Never had like the grand scale of like.
Actual wedding yeah and i thought it.
Would just be fun to see what some of my.
My auntie's and uncles dressed up i mean.
They never wear anything close to like.
Suits and that's easy yeah something.
Different something different yeah that.
You know it's always about for me i.
Always see life as like something that.
You can look back on and remember and.
Those are your only gonna remember.
Certain things mm-hmm and i just want.
Like you know for my family that would.
Be a cool thing to remember when.
Everyone was dressed up and had like.
This actual ball or whatever kind of.
Like something that was from like a.
Fairy tale or something but it's not.
Gonna be that it's gonna be our version.
It's gonna be a greg and dana wedding.
Like always and dana's family is her.
Family is big.
Her family is huge she has some like i.
Think she herself has 100 something.
People and oh my god what well of course.
It's gonna be expensive then i mean.
Don't you think big does well even if it.
Was like cheap like yeah i mean not.
Cheap even if it was affordable.
Like if you got mcdonald's for everyone.
Mm-hmm inviting that many people is just.
But even like the venue like just.
Because i don't know and i'm sure paco.
Doesn't know and a lot of people who.
Haven't gotten married don't know what.
Is like give me an average breakdown of.
Like when you're looking for venues and.
Like say you have what 200 people coming.
Right what is like what is the price.
They're giving so the venue itself it.
Depends on like what you are going for.
If you're going for like a wake up like.
A big venue yeah usually they'll have.
Everything included like the food and.
All that and that can get up to about.
100 to 200 dollar sway a person okay so.
What is like so if you were to go with.
Those bigger venues right 200 people.
Like it's like a bigger wedding i think.
Right but in general like what was like.
The mid-range price they were quoting.
You probably about mid range with drinks.
And food and the venue everything.
Included i would say a clean hundred.
Dollars per person in nevada the average.
Cost for weddings is 296 dollars per.
Person that per person okay so that's.
Already way more than what you're seeing.
That's crazy that's freaking crazy.
And you saw $100 per person is.
Affordable yeah that's like she's always.
A 200 people that's 20 grand.
Right yeah and that's not even including.
The videographer photographer i'm just.
Gonna have you guys just shaking a.
Little bit and think about like how much.
Is the average wedding dress you know.
Dana's wedding dress price like all.
Those things add up it's like you got to.
Be rich to get married exactly or we're.
Not rich but you got it like to have.
Like one of those like a pretty wedding.
That you've seen in like movies and.
Stuff you have to be pretty wealthy and.
And it's kind of crazy to me how many.
How expected that is i'm not even i'm.
Not even including the ring like the.
Cost of a ring yeah and i've always.
Thought this and i know that a lot of.
People will disagree including my own.
Probably my parents cuz they're married.
I think weddings are like a scam i.
Didn't agree with that too but i thought.
I thought woked oh okay explain to me.
Explain to me why what you what you were.
Told i wasn't told anything i was.
Okay when i was when guests come yeah.
They usually give money as gifts.
So i guess get back the guests are.
Paying for the experience with you.
Mm-hmm.
So if you know as long as you're not.
Like just going ridiculous like you're.
Not spending a million dollars in your.
Wedding it's not gonna be that much of a.
Financial it's like an investment of a.
Good time right something that you can.
Like experience with your family and.
Your loved ones right they're gonna at.
Some point give you something in return.
And it should be kind of like a balance.
Right but in the grand scheme so you're.
Kind of essentially like so the way i.
See it is you're basically i mean the.
Way you have to see is you're just.
Throwing a party for other people right.
But i think like okay so you're saying.
That you put in all this money in this.
Venue to that whatever you get a lot of.
It back because the people coming right.
Not all of it but you've got a bunch of.
Money or gifts or whatever it is you get.
Value right.
The only people like i get that and when.
They have weddings the same thing.
Happens to them the only the only people.
Who are really coming up is the business.
Itself like wedding the wedding industry.
People who sell the rings who set who.
Are that you pay for the the venue and.
Right and so on and no those those are.
The that's what i'm saying it's like.
It's not i'm not the scam was a wrong.
Way to say it i think it's just a very.
Smart business that we've in society.
Taught people that is this is the route.
You go it's something that you're always.
Like everyone like this is the dream i.
Always face is that like that's.
Everything know like any event you're.
Gonna want to celebrate it's gonna be.
That type of model where it's gonna be.
Someone's gonna be making money off of.
It even as small as like a super bowl.
Party right you know like some any type.
Of event where you're gathering people.
And you're just celebrating having fun.
Mm-hmm i mean anytime you think about it.
You are spending you're willing to spend.
Money what just outfit a difference is.
Is like there's things in weddings that.
Is not your average party a getting a.
Dress that cost that much that you'll.
Wear once to meet like logically if you.
Tell someone who doesn't who's an alien.
From outer space and they're like oh you.
So you guys can get.
Right you're gonna be together risk your.
Lies cool why do you need to pay this.
Amount of money for this thing that mmm.
That you're gonna wear once and same.
With the ring like it's like oh there's.
Diamonds in general again we're taught.
That has so much value but i don't know.
If this is true but i've heard so many.
Times that diamonds aren't actually that.
Rare and compared to other gems i don't.
Know it's diamonds are not rare yeah but.
We've given it so much value right i.
Actually just looked at up cuz i i've.
Heard this before about i wanted to look.
A little bit more you know how it it.
Basically talks about how it was a.
Marketing campaign in the nineteen for.
What's-his-name ryan no all right.
I didn't see it but i know what you're.
Talking about that's exactly what the.
Myth of like diamonds you're saying yeah.
Weddings in general right all weddings.
In general we're just back then rich.
People used to get married and now it's.
Like you know lower-class people wanna.
Do the same things that the rich people.
Were doing right and is also used it was.
A ways of exchanging land um back in.
Like europe and stuff really or it would.
Be like we have a treaty things like.
That it was basically used as a in.
Agreement between two richer larger.
Families uh-huh that's what it was for.
Or there was like you know dowry whereas.
It's like i think dowry is worth the.
Woman's family right has to give an.
Offering as well to the man and that's.
Just how it was before and then we.
Normalized it by saying hey this is like.
What love is you know marriage right and.
All these things and i mean that's kind.
Of just like what capitalism is you know.
You're selling people an idea yeah and.
If you can make them believe it you can.
Make money off yeah but what i'm saying.
And i'm i think what is happening is a.
Lot of people are going non-traditional.
Yeah as i think like with anything right.
We're not gonna do everything.
Necessarily our parents right right over.
Time you get your own you know point of.
View but anyway i don't have any issue.
With with it because it's still that.
Normal right and i in our society and i.
Have no issue following that because it.
Does bring happiness to people but when.
People don't do it a specific way and.
They're being judged for it yeah i think.
That's where it's an issue i think it's.
Definitely an issue when you know it.
Doesn't become fun for the people right.
And doing it yeah two main people that.
Are supposed to be having fun i feel.
Once it gets to doing traditions that.
They don't even understand or you know.
They're they're just doing it just.
Because that's when it becomes kind of.
You know why are you even doing it.
They're right yeah it's just like you're.
Just following these traditions but.
That's so many people who do things to.
Please others yeah but i mean like.
That's that's where i think it's.
Changing because in the past you just do.
It right like our parents days like yeah.
Yeah get a nice dress get a nice place.
Make sure everyone eats well right you.
Don't worry about eating you like deta.
And my parents don't even remember.
Eating what their meal but everyone else.
Did right and most times you hear this.
Only reasoning because we're at that age.
Where a lot of our friends are getting.
Married and stuff like that you hear so.
Many stories of like oh i'm so stressed.
I gotta plan the wedding like for a.
Whole year the girl or whoever's.
Planning it and and it's a financial.
Burden and you know they don't have.
Necessarily the same money that a thirty.
Year old when our parents were growing.
Up might have and it's kind of like why.
Are you getting married then like i get.
You go to the courthouse i get you don't.
Have the dream you're not everything we.
Grew up watching and movies and stuff.
Like that but like if you're so.
Miserable from this you know it's gonna.
Put a strain on your actual relationship.
Then you should just you don't need to.
Do that and also you could technically.
Do this you could just go to the.
Courthouse get married and then do the.
Like official wedding later cuz your.
Friends aren't ever gonna be like hey.
This is your actual anniversary.
Hey do you remember when your.
Anniversary was yeah you don't remember.
Your friend's anniversaries or anything.
Like that so why does it matter it.
Doesn't matter it oh yeah that stuff is.
Just it's if you actually love each.
Other and you can't really you're not.
Into throwing parties and you're not.
Into you know getting your family and.
Friends together and that that's just.
Not your thing then yeah yeah weddings.
It's not something you have to do and.
Also like going back i mean like one of.
The main reasons i guess arguments for.
Marriage is because it's religious as.
Well which i mean like i get that it is.
Right it's a religious thing yeah.
If other if not for that reason like.
Let's say you're not the most religious.
Person in the world or you don't go to.
Church every sunday or whatever like you.
Know you're just.
Average person that sounds bad.
Not that the average person doesn't go.
To church anyway i'm covering up my.
Council culture right now so i you know.
Giving myself insurance mom if for.
Somebody who isn't necessarily getting.
Married because of religion what really.
Change like for you yourself like you.
Guys aren't i don't think it was a.
Church what's really gonna change other.
Than like you know being able to claim.
For me you guys are a couple like.
Legally what changes for you how was.
Your life gonna change once you're.
Married versus not because you're.
Already living together yeah as far as.
Lay together i mean the we're always.
Gonna love each other we've been.
Together for so long that the main.
Reason we're getting married is just to.
Have some fun yeah like that's why i'm.
Really excited like i'm actually really.
Excited because i know that we're gonna.
Have this big party.
Don't the main thing that's gonna change.
For us is basically just taxes yeah.
Right that's like one of the biggest.
Benefits too right but i mean like that.
That that's the thing too if you'd.
Really think about it other than the.
Incentive of you know having taxes it.
Doesn't it's there's not a big jump.
Anymore because people are already.
Living together they're already sleeping.
Together it's too expensive in the past.
It was a little different right yeah.
Because it was like you don't well for.
One you don't have sex until you're.
Married right like i'm one i'm sure.
People didn't always follow that but it.
Was more of a thing yeah.
Also i the fact that you don't really.
You're not supposed to live with someone.
Before you're married mmm i don't know.
Is that a religious thing was just like.
Temptations i don't think that's so much.
A religious thing it's just like that.
You're allowing yourself to be living.
With temptation there any but yeah but.
Anyway that times were different right.
Way i mean marriage was it was so much.
Of a bigger deal it's like now it's like.
People move in after being together for.
A couple months right you know what that.
Would be that would be a complete you.
Wouldn't that's unheard of right now.
Parents time and i think that's it's.
Just where we are right now that's why.
It's it's kind of changing yeah it's.
Definitely changing but i think it's.
Changing for the better for sure yeah.
It's like you know people are realizing.
That yeah like weddings aren't essential.
Like you don't have.
To have a big wedding and you can do.
These just kind of non-traditional.
Smaller weddings but you know what to.
Play the devil's advocate then cuz it.
Seems like we're all on the same side.
Mm-hmm since you mentioned that weddings.
Aren't essential and it's something that.
You can choose to do to display your.
Love what did it mean more than if you.
Are doing that to spend more you mean.
Yet to spend more grand gesture i'm.
Doing this is how much i love this.
Person and sometimes a lot of people.
Because they're there's different love.
Languages you know but who are you doing.
That for because if you're both on the.
Same page right the girl and the guy and.
They both don't care about that no but.
See what do they do that maybe that's.
That's what that's why if they do then.
Do it like of course like that's if you.
Want to make her happy and she wants.
That or vice versa right then you do it.
Right if you can afford you do it.
Because you want to make your partner.
Happy if you both don't care about it.
Who are you doing it for mm your family.
Members you could do it for them but.
Like really then should you be really.
Making them happy with your wedding just.
Throw a party but i mean i understand.
What you're saying but what i'm saying.
Is like that's good our perspective yeah.
If we're trying to understand somebody.
Who is actively trying to do a wedding.
Right right you know what i mean i mean.
Great they're doing it right now and i.
Think like you said you guys don't.
Really care about it that much but it's.
Something you've grew up wanting right.
I'm sure you did too and i'm sure dana.
Of course did yeah dana grew up wanting.
One i just never it wasn't like wasn't.
Even a thing it was just like like.
People got married courthouse is like.
That's like my family tradition so.
Having like a big wedding it's kind of a.
Surprise.
And so she didn't want to respect your.
Tradition i'm just kidding wow yeah like.
I think it's just yeah i could see it.
Just people wanting to ball out i said.
When people are the clubs and they just.
Buy a thousand dollar bottles for right.
You know even though it's like 30 bucks.
At the store yeah exactly.
It's just like a cool something you.
Don't get to do suggest your sub ah yeah.
It's a good reason to do something kind.
Of crazy.
We've talked a lot about weddings and it.
Disgusts me i've been single for so long.
But that's besides the point but are we.
Still going to be seeing crazy.
Gregg cuz you kind of toned down a lot.
Over these past couple of years yeah and.
Uh this what is crazy gregg well i just.
Want to ask about a story that happened.
In singapore if you want to share that.
That's a lot of course i'll share that.
Your sheriff urilla oh you've never.
Talked about this what ever talked about.
Yeah all right but before we get into.
This let's take a shishi break because.
This is a long one this is a good one.
Yeah this is a crazy one this is gonna.
Make people look at you different yeah.
Even they may not marry and we're back.
Rhythm yeah we um that was a long break.
What were we talk we we were a good.
Story.
Yeah in singapore not nobody knows it.
Really publicly some people know if they.
Live in singapore it's or they're at the.
Event yeah it's very well kept yes a.
Very sensitive sensitive story yeah.
Let's let's start this off with a little.
So we hop what year was this when we.
Went to singapore before i was in yeah.
So what years that either 14 or 15 okay.
So it was me greg will and david david.
Was there.
Arden was there as well there was just a.
Few of us yeah yeah we were doing like a.
Little mini like shows like we just do.
More shows and stuff back then and then.
We were in singapore and i believe this.
Is before we actually did the show like.
People take us out and stuff like that.
We went to this club and it's at the top.
Of marina bay sands which is like for.
Those of you that know ones like that.
That ship looking thing and crazy rich.
Asians you know the three towers yeah.
Has like a boat ending scene in crazy.
Rich asians that their jemma meets harry.
Shum jr and then you're like do you.
Remember that.
Remember that i just do my work was a.
Dog i get what okay.
Anyway it's a very famous pitch at the.
Top of there it's called c'est la vie.
I think the club we're at this club i.
Guess a day before performance and then.
It goes down like so mind-blowing we had.
A performance the next day mm-hmm he.
Didn't have a performance ready.
Two days two days from there right.
That's true two days yep so we had a lot.
Of work to do still.
Mm-hmm and we wanted to get to sleep.
Early that night just how we can wake up.
And you know get to get to making our.
Performance yes so we're trying to get.
Out of this club early and our hosts you.
Know brings out some about although for.
Drinks free drinks right and we're like.
Oh man this is gonna take forever.
Yep none of us wanted a drink and we.
Just kind of wanted to get out of there.
Quick but you know we didn't want to be.
Disrespectful disrespectful and the fact.
That like you saw the prices of these.
You know a bottle at a club is expensive.
Lot about a club there and singapore is.
So you like oh dude we came up on free.
Alcohol anyway we tried to finish it.
Really quickly which results in so i.
Took the bottle and i just like down the.
Whole thing basically like the whole.
Thing like a lot of it a lot of daniel.
And was a lot the night was it was a.
Slow night when we first got there at.
Least and so me and will we're dancers.
Where we you know we like to dance so we.
Were you know just dancing on the dance.
Floor after i drank the drink and we.
Were just dancing the night away and now.
Were you were you dancing being goofy or.
No like we're actually dancing having.
Fun okay keep in mind this place was.
Kind of empty right it's kind of empty.
Because we got there kind of weird there.
Kind of early and then you know oh as.
We're trying to finish this bottle you.
Know greg everyone's game or intoxicated.
Yeah right and they're just dancing like.
In the open floor.
Like not that many people so people on.
The side stuff like that and i mean i.
Don't know if it was like the singapore.
Culture or whatever but it was kind of.
Like more wallflowers than we're used to.
People were kind of not really enhancing.
Mood yeah so we were like me were like.
Oh come on dance you know let's have fun.
And so we were we're getting the the.
Dance for kind of cracking you know.
People were with random people.
We're random people we were like dancing.
With a bunch of people like we got we.
Got the place poppin i mean i'm sure the.
Club appreciated then he's like the guy.
Who went and got the party started.
Anyway like you could have gotten a job.
That night basically man the party's.
Maybe yeah and they're not things got.
Kinda out of hand because i was trying.
To get the whole place dancing the whole.
Place i literally i mean like everyone.
Dancing i wanted everyone to be off the.
Off the chairs off the walls and moving.
And grooving and i i just pulled the.
Wrong person up these two gigantic dudes.
Who are like we had our table there was.
Like at some random other table not even.
00 like we were like sitting down.
They were like standing up next to this.
Table two big-ass dudes like i'm talking.
Like bodybuilders like think think you a.
Mountain you know from from what's a.
Game of thrones but like shorter so that.
Same with almost like brock lesnar's.
Kind of thing with not as big as brock.
Lesnar but like think similar build got.
It same build as brock lesnar but.
Smaller okay anyway these two i guess.
They're a different weight lifts a who.
Knows what their their weight lifters it.
Looked like just two dudes who look like.
They could be freaking.
Bodybuilders anyway greg goes up to.
These guys like he has to everybody else.
And i don't know what happened from.
There cuz i wasn't there either.
Yeah well you don't remember according.
To other people who did see it you're.
Just doing the same thing like trying to.
Get them to dance or something and then.
I don't know what happened what were you.
Taught yeah like i i had no idea what.
Happened from there because i don't know.
What happened well the big dude punched.
You in the face that's what happened.
Like so we got filled.
Over time what happened and supposedly i.
Was really adamant about getting these.
Two guys to come up and dance with us.
Uh-huh and supposedly one of them was.
Look polynesian and i mean i'm neither.
From new zealand right yeah i think one.
Of them was uh yeah and i was like hey.
Are you samoan or whatever i guess i was.
Just trying to you know connect with him.
Right here somali yeah and they were.
Just not having it i mean from what i.
What we heard was that they probably.
Thought that we were you know like they.
Were just kind of homophobic maybe and.
Maybe they thought that we're getting.
Them to dance i was like trying to hit.
On them or something and they just.
Weren't having it and i guess one of.
Them just knocked me out yeah straight.
In the face and the crazy thing is again.
I didn't see it firsthand but i'm being.
Told from people who did see it cuz it.
Was right next to us i just wasn't look.
In that direction is that there was no.
Like like pushing like you know you know.
When fights start shake happens people.
Gather and then you separate but there.
Was no like pushing away moment it was.
Just great was in this face i guess i'm.
Not like gonna degress it when they come.
The school party whatever and then it's.
Just turn around punch straight in the.
Face there was like it was instantaneous.
And then it was just like panic so what.
Happened was it was a just instant punch.
Right to my face only thing i remember.
Was i was i was on the ground wills side.
Of the story was that he punched me and.
Then instantly he was like in regret.
Mode because all of the singapore not.
Singapore what club security like.
Surrounded him and i was on the ground.
And out you guys thought i was dead.
Pretty much hmm i will they picked me up.
And i guess there was just blood.
Everywhere not to be too graphic but it.
Was literally pouring out of my face.
Blood everywhere and i just got my.
Braces on maybe about.
Maybe two or three months before that.
And my teeth were loose because of the.
Braces well that's what the doctor told.
Me it's loose when they're moving you.
Know you guys lifted me up and i guess.
Two of my teeth were missing yep.
The front not the front two but one of.
The front tooth and then like the one.
Next to it yeah if you're watching these.
Two teeth.
We're not gone gone gone did you ever.
Find them we spent like a long time.
Looking for them because we thought.
Maybe i could get it back in him you.
Know like we spent a long time looking.
All over nobody could find it we thought.
Maybe he swallowed it but we it's not.
Funny it is traumatic for him i think in.
The moment greg is luke i don't once.
He's lucky but he does not realize the.
Scare we had to deal with we're in.
Another country yep right we don't i.
Didn't know at first what happened we.
Thought he wasn't responsive because he.
Was knocked out like cold um and we.
Thought he was dead.
Will was freaking know it was like.
Crying because he thought he was you.
Were legit dead david - he was so mad.
He's like i'm gonna kill he was like i'm.
Gonna kill those guys and he was serious.
I was he's like the funniest picture.
First of all david is what like four.
Feet listen to this and those guys you.
Guys were saying or like oh he was big.
He was like ready like he was gonna he.
Didn't he was in a rage i've never seen.
That mad before anyway yes yeah you know.
You have good friends when someone well.
We talked about the size i was willing.
To just rage out on someone double your.
Size my whole thing was trying to stay.
Calm because they came to me like ooh.
Did you see what like will was like in.
Tears i was like what what and then i.
Didn't know i didn't know what was going.
On it was so loud i couldn't see.
Anything anyway.
This is like a couple minutes after it.
Already or a minute after it already.
Happened when the commotion was going on.
They told me what happened and david was.
Like i'm gonna kill it like he's gonna.
Kill these people and the whole thing.
The whole time was this like just trying.
To calm them too and and i don't know.
Where you were that.
But you were with somebody was in heaven.
Yeah and then you came back down and.
Then the next thing i remember we were.
Um they were dead like security their.
Version of police who are which is so.
Funny because these huge guys are police.
Are small dude like like those guys.
Wanted to they no one could stop them.
They're like huge and they're police.
People were very tiny like our size.
Anyway they took statements i guess like.
That dude did all that thing i'm sure.
They took them in you went to the.
Hospital i was rushed to the hospital.
I'm not in an ambulance and hmm i.
Believe you came with me i was with you.
Uh me and already went with you but yeah.
First before we even got to the hospital.
She woke up and i had you on my lap and.
They had the club yeah at the club we.
Were like we're waiting because it was.
Like they were gonna they're taking.
Statements and stuff like that oh yeah.
Your lap like i was like you were like.
Like laying on my like like i don't know.
How to just be laying on my lap you're.
Just like bleeding all over me like a.
Baby.
Kinda like you're just like knocked out.
Like you couldn't sit up straight and.
You kept trying to you just kept falling.
Over anyway i don't think i even told.
You this but no you just kept.
Apologizing and i was like dude it's.
Okay and you know i don't think he even.
Knew that your teeth were missing at.
That point so my jobs i'm trying to not.
Say that to you because you're already.
Freaking out and then you were worried.
About dana's like no i'll talk to dana.
Don't worry like i'll text you that.
You're fine like you were so worried.
About everything it was like how am i.
Gonna drink it to him that he had no.
Teeth though like if he's freaking out.
About this how am i gonna tell him he.
Got no teeth it was crazy.
And anyway yeah so we went to hospital.
We just followed you okay i don't know.
He didn't come with me in that no they.
Didn't didn't let so we went met.
Separately okay the hospital waited.
Hella long you're in the room and.
They're just they just saw us in that's.
When i woke up for ambulance no i woke.
Up at the hospital and that's when like.
I consciously remember from there mm-hmm.
He has remember that first episode of.
Walking dead when he wakes up in the.
Hospital and like he doesn't know where.
He's at.
And like everything is just foreign to.
Him that's kind of like what i woke up.
That's terrifying.
It was legit her she know you were still.
In singapore so i knew that i was in.
Singapore but i didn't know like i felt.
Like i time-traveled mm-hmm and.
Something happened because the lady came.
In and she she was talking to me in this.
Thick accent the thick singaporean.
Accent and i mean i i could barely.
Understand her and the only thing i.
Could worry about was my hat because i.
Had hair back then and my hair was you.
Know was a mess you know like i was.
Balding and was a fool here did you know.
And then that's when i realized i was.
Like man the hell's wrong with my tongue.
Like i feel like a metal bar in my mouth.
Uh-huh and like i was feeling around in.
That metal bar that i was feeling was my.
Braces because my tongue was poking.
Through the whole of my mic gap or your.
Teeth or you know i was feeling them the.
Braces and i was feeling like the.
Bracket and or the bar the brace with.
The brackets and they were loose mm-hmm.
You know like that the toys at the.
Dentist's office were you know he can.
Spin the thing on the thing yeah yeah i.
Could do that with my braces brackets.
And i was like wow that's weird and then.
I think i had my phone and that's when i.
Popped open the the camera and i looked.
At myself and that's when i that's when.
It finally put it missing my tea did you.
Put it together though like what have.
You know so i was like crap what.
Happened like i was like my memory was.
So bad that i didn't even remember that.
We were at the club the only thing i.
Could remember was you know well you.
Know us getting ready for the club yep.
And then you know maybe us dancing but i.
Slowly like the doctors are coming in.
Checking up on me it really started to.
Hit me that it was serious when a.
Singaporean police guy came in he was.
Like hello mr. sonny time like how you.
Feeling.
Need to go over some you know some.
Question i have some questions for you.
And you know that's why i'm like i was.
Freaking out because they were he was.
Asking me if i had any gang affiliation.
Wasn't like you know yeah if there was.
If i had any like firearms or anything.
On me i was like what are you talking.
About.
And then he told me the whole back sort.
Of what happened and then i was i was.
Caught up from there right but i checked.
Out my um you know my tent my doctor.
Stuff was all good i the the doctor said.
That they couldn't find my teeth.
Supposedly i swallowed them and they.
Were you know they were saying if i made.
Bowel movements recently and if they saw.
If i saw teeth in it that is like you.
Know to check there or whatever and then.
I was like the after that i was released.
And that's when you guys sent someone to.
Pick me up right we were there.
Ardan went in there that's right that's.
Right cuz they wouldn't let me in but.
She somehow convinced them to let her in.
That's right i think she lied honestly.
To get in to see she was like family or.
Something she said that she was yeah one.
Of my family members she came in to talk.
To me and and tell me you know all the.
Septa to tell them to the tell the.
Police to you know like be the author.
What to update the police what happened.
Yeah and i don't remember any of that.
I must have blacked out again i think so.
But basically what happens was i got a.
Strike in singapore how many strikes do.
You get there i don't know but i know.
Here you get three strikes baseball.
Strike we work with cricket or all i.
Know is i have this singaporean police.
Thing this is one strike.
It's basically says you have a warning.
Blow of love but the police chief guy he.
Said that i have a strike don't mess.
Around here ever again yeah i don't.
Think like.
Like even though even if you were gay.
Like you were getting people to dance.
Like you don't that shouldn't give you a.
String like that guy should have like.
34 that if you get one he should have.
At least 3 yeah you know what it was.
Like a 17 strike so don't worry dude 1.
Strikes not even that bad yeah you're 60.
More i have no idea what happened to him.
Supposedly he got a way worse punishing.
Punishment than i did but i have no idea.
So well you could have if you wanted to.
Take like in a lawsuit against him right.
Right there was a bunch yeah became not.
Worth it right cuz you have to go back.
To singapore something it was like if i.
Wanted to pursue it i would have had to.
Stay there and what it's out months and.
Months and i was just trying to you know.
Music.
Talk about the because what yeah because.
That's what funny part that's really.
Yeah that's right so that was the.
Beginning of the trip yeah that was like.
The second day we were there and we had.
A lot of stuff to do is one that next.
Day you were still separated from us we.
Didn't in you dread to make her perform.
I was all right sorry i kept you again.
But yeah you guys picked me up and i.
Came back to you guys yeah i was still.
Kind of dazed and confused i was still.
Kind of that walking dead.
You know like mindset like that time or.
Whatever drunk and knocked out i i go to.
The hotel to put you guys and you guys.
Are practicing you guys are practicing.
The the routine.
Yeah and i'm like hey guys and you guys.
Are like oh hey greg's here we can we.
Can put them back in now you guys didn't.
Address any of the crap that we we did.
It's just without you knowing we did.
Yeah but like i was just like okay and.
We just got to practice in you talk.
Nothing about what just happened we did.
After we'd finished practice after we.
Did with dean because you're making.
Jokes yeah and then you guys like i was.
Crazy night huh yeah you just kept.
Trying to whenever we were like look at.
You you just smile and show us your no.
Teeth like are we going to start.
Laughing and like it was a weird eerie.
Feeling just like nothing was really.
That bad to like that's what it felt.
Like to me except that i was missing.
Teeth so after after we got the routine.
Down we had to do these like we had to.
Do the performance obviously so we did.
The performance and after that we have.
Like meet and greets yep where we had to.
Go to you know take pictures with fans.
And all that so every fan that was take.
Pictures with me i'm known to smile.
Usually whenever i'm pretty happy yeah.
I'm usually smiling.
There's not one picture of me smiling in.
That trick this tight-lipped yeah and i.
Mean i feel bad but at the same time it.
That's where you know like i i came up.
With this thing you know that the thumbs.
Up picture i always do that's because of.
That singapore now we know so that.
Awkward thing that i always do on my.
Instagram that's because you don't have.
Teeth that's why i didn't have teeth and.
Then you got perfect teeth almost even.
Better than your original ones yeah they.
Did they did a really good job with.
Their clothes and ears no so i got.
Implants so they went when i got back.
The dentist said yeah your jaw line is.
Jacked so they had to put in bone graft.
Was it jack because of a punch.
Yeah i think when oh damn when they when.
I when i got punched like a chunk of my.
My jaw line got you know taken out with.
It and yeah they had to put in some new.
New bone to be able to support some.
Metal implants so that way they can.
Connect new teeth too so i have to fake.
Teeth and they look like the best - in.
Your mouth lesson one kids if you lose.
Your teeth you can worst-case scenario.
If you can afford it.
Yeah back there's all.
Was a chance there's always a chance to.
Get your teeth back always a chance and.
Then you'll have a great story with.
Friends that you can share and then also.
The lesson is don't worry about.
Finishing your free alcohol yeah yes and.
Also if you do finish your free alcohol.
Don't dance with big people yeah so he's.
Basically lucky that only two teeth left.
His mouth and his soul didn't because.
Shocking that you didn't get some kind.
Of brain damage maybe you did who knows.
It was pretty it was pretty um it was.
Pretty intense he was over abit i watch.
You if i watch mma yeah and like nah.
Clothes don't normally last that long.
When they're knocked out mmm but then he.
Also had alcohol in his system really.
Drunk yeah and you didn't remember.
Anything this is a good commercial for.
Like psa for like not getting wasted.
Well if you think about it you're lucky.
You drank a lot cuz then you already had.
Anesthesiology like going through your.
Body sure that's my guess so yeah i.
Always think about half cup half full.
Positive they're optimistic there it is.
Oh the real optimistic thing is like.
Crime in singapore is like punished by.
Like lashings like the real bad crimes.
Yeah it's not it's not like crime here.
Like you honestly like i died.
You're lucky you just got a strike even.
Though it wasn't your fault yeah but.
Like crime there is and i'm speaking.
Just from singaporeans telling me like.
You get you can get lashings first i.
Don't know what has lashings are there.
Like whips like you're getting wit they.
Have is that capital punishment i.
Believe so.
They have acts like i think they still.
Do hangings like yeah i could be wrong.
But singaporeans you guys can let me.
Know like that's not in the comments the.
Worst thing you've heard about no but.
You can get like a legit like wit and.
Like people this is another story that's.
That i was told from my singaporean is.
Like this guy did something and they.
Whipped him i think like once or twice.
And it's so painful because they put.
Something on the on the whip yeah.
It slices your back open and so painful.
That he passed out rather than.
Continuing they waited till he woke back.
Wow to continue the rest of his lashings.
Oh so it's like that's like but if you.
Think about and and singapore is one of.
The safest places in the world.
That's why with that kind of power i.
Know why i know so if like i know it.
Sounds inhumane right that's the.
Argument even for what people are you.
Hear right for the death penalty but.
Don't you think if our punishments were.
Things like that you you would think.
Twice about a lot of things oh for sure.
But like how do you argue that because.
You know people will say like that's so.
Inhumane you know i'm saying it would.
Definitely kill comedy yes yes well the.
Thing is we wouldn't change our laws.
Right if we kept the laws of thing just.
The punishments mmm.
Don't you think that would work well.
This the argument is right for the death.
Penalty is like what if you find out.
Later that guy was actually innocent.
Then you murdered someone who was.
Innocent yeah right but then like we.
Still have the death penalty so like it.
Could still happen so a singapore we're.
Coming out next year.
I actually would love to go back to.
Singapore.
I have a great time there yeah i know i.
Do don't know that singapore has been.
Great safe for us great yeah i love it.
There it's just that got was even from.
Singapore so i don't think he was oh he.
Wasn't like from a new zealanders to.
Just rowdy americans causing trouble you.
Like their country he must have had what.
Makes sense that he would have a roid.
Rage because who turned around and just.
Hit someone without like pushing them.
Away for like you would have if that.
Happened there would have been a crowd.
You wouldn't have gotten punished you.
Probably would have fell to the ground.
Very far away escorted out yeah you.
Would have got escorted out probably and.
Him yeah and then we would have been.
Fine but like well let's just say this.
Greg doesn't even know that he might.
Have pushed him in like you know i do.
Everybody else that was there said the.
Same thing yeah but a lot of times you.
Know like in in in panic and stuff no we.
Were trying to figure out why would he.
Do that that and then and then we were.
Like okay well let's think about like.
This if some random dude small dude was.
Coming up to you like all drunk and.
Dancing he you would think he's trying.
To hit on you or you were thinking like.
He's you know whatever we were trying to.
Give reasons cuz it didn't make sense.
Why he would have that reaction i don't.
Know i would have punch me maybe you.
Said something racist.
Anyway that was the uh that was a long.
Story that's a funny story.
It's out there now yeah it is out there.
But i'm gonna be looking at me.
Differently i don't think so your teeth.
Are very nice now actually it was a show.
You show you i bet you the comments are.
Gonna be like greg hope your teeth get.
Soon buddy.
Well now said it was a good one yeah man.
We sold your story man hey it was worth.
It.
Plus it's barely your story that's.
Morning like cancel culture thing i.
Don't have to worry about anymore i.
