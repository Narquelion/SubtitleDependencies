Your book wearing this wearing only.
Peace.

Oh daddy you're so fat.
Whoa - oh my god rules we got to get out.
Of here the boat is sinking.
What do you mean look there's water.
Everywhere what are you talking about.
You comb your hair every morning i.
Promise promise me that you'll brush.
Your teeth more often okay.
And last promise me that deal you'll.
Never let go i promise i won't let go.
