Music.
Introducing the all-new.
Completely redesigned iphone 7.
Iphone 8. when we released the iphone 7.
People complained that it was basically.
The same thing as the six just that we.
Added another camera but this time we.
Made sure that wasn't the case.
We added two more cameras to give us the.
First ever quad camera experience people.
Who think it's stupid or unnecessary to.
Have.
Four cameras on one phone just don't.
Understand that now with the quad camera.
You can take one picture and you'll have.
Four of that same exact picture you can.
Never do that before just think about.
What you could do with that if you're a.
Parent of quadruplets you don't need to.
Get all of them.
Sit still for a picture you just need.
One you take two pictures you got the.
Point of view of a spider just like that.
You don't have to take eight individual.
Pictures anymore i mean even for video.
The video resolution alone you film 1k.
You're shooting 4k now which is kind of.
One of the main reasons why we went from.
The dual cam straight to the quad cam.
And skipped the tri-cam because you know.
If you film with the tri-cam the.
Resolution is a little.
Well too samsung for us it's a little.
Too edgy last thing we want is people to.
Get heated over this and explode on us.
You know another thing that people.
Really criticize us for when we released.
The 7 was the lack of new iphone colors.
Even though we did introduce two new.
Colors black and jet black.
People still weren't pleased for some.
Reason so this time around in addition.
To the original colors we're also.
Announcing a bunch of new and fresh.
Colors for the iphone 8 ranging from.
Matte black to shiny matte black light.
Skin brother black.
Jack black jack black on a hot day look.
I could keep going but we'd be here all.
Day.
Just know that all these new colors will.
Never get old because they're all black.
And black black don't crack and even.
With all the things we announced so far.
The craziest thing about the iphone 8.
The price you ready for this we are.
Pricing the iphone 8 at exactly one.
Dollar one dollar.
It's pretty much free i mean of course.
There are a few add-ons that you're.
Going to need just like the 7 the iphone.
8 doesn't have any headphone jack so if.
You want to use headphones you have to.
Buy the wireless ones.
Not a big deal we did change the charger.
Port again.
We actually added two more charger ports.
To make it faster all three parts are.
Different so you have to get all three.
Different chargers and actually they.
Don't plug into the wall anymore they.
Only plug into our three new macbooks so.
You have to get those as well a couple.
More fun new features for the iphone 8.
We also took all the lighting.
Capabilities out of the iphone so you'll.
Have to purchase the eye light if you.
Want to use flash or.
Flashlight on the phone we made it a lot.
Easier to text and write messages with.
The iboard so.
Your phone actually doesn't have a.
Keyboard anymore you actually need the.
Iboard if you want to write anything the.
Iphone 8 comes with the premium color.
Version of every app so you also have to.
Purchase youtube red and facebook blue.
And snapchat yellow and so on.
Also if you want any reception or.
Internet of any kind you'll need the i.
Cell phone tower mini this one is.
Actually not wireless so that the.
Internet's faster so you have to bring.
It wherever you go.
Also siri is no longer in the phone we.
Actually made her external so you have.
To buy a person as well.
Music.
Oh and i almost forgot to mention one of.
The biggest new features we developed.
Unlike the seven which is only water.
Resistant we.
Finally developed a way to make the.
Iphone completely waterproof all i have.
To do is use our new highly advanced.
Iphone case called the.
Ian droid.
