I cannot believe this video has over a.
Hundred million views there's just a.
Bunch of girls shaking their booties.
Well that's exactly why it's girls.
Shaking their booties come on that's my.
Point that's what all these songs and.
Music videos are about these days that's.
All guys want to see i mean not all guys.
I personally would rather see a nice.
Sweet innocent girl for a change than a.
Girl who's the acting like a stripper.
There's never going to be because.
Rappers don't want to rap about that.
Stuff what you want in a girl is like.
The opposite of every rap song well then.
I guess that leaves us with no choice.
We'll just have to make our own rap song.
Music.
With a turnip yeah well a beet and dough.
And bread that was made from the dough.
Yeah i still don't get it if i said.
We're making a song what does any of.

Didn't have a good segue into the music.

Want a bad chick i want a big booty she.
Covered up nice with the jcpenney shoes.
