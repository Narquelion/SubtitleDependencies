Let me guess he broke up with you for no.
Reason again yeah i just don't.
Understand why he would dump me like i.
Not ready for this seriously.
Well i mean i guess this is the first.
Time you ever got dumped twice in one.
Day i hate guys why can't guys be more.
Like girls wait what why can't guys be.
More like girls are you kidding me girls.
Are the one who well first off kpop.
Stars secondly girls are the ones that.
Should be more like guys you actually.
Think well the wnba yeah but you.
Actually think that relationships would.
Be better if girls were more like guys.
Yeah you're completely wrong well then i.
Guess we both know what needs to be done.
All war that has been going on for ages.
A war so brutal that even the gods.
Themselves have just get to it.
Guys versus girls.
You shall not pass.
Music.
Okay first off guys are shallow oh right.
This again all guys care about is boobs.
Ass and tits boobs and tits are the same.
Thing but now hotter girl looks you know.
There's way more to us than our exterior.
Yeah i admit guys can be a little.
Shallow sometime told ya but don't.
Pretend like girls aren't just as.
Shallow.
Oh please there's no way okay then tell.
Me white girls go crazy over guys with.
Nice bodies you don't do that can you.
Really look me in the eye and tell me.
That the reason why so many girls love.
Taylor lautner is because of his acting.
Uh yeah the reason why so many girls.
Love taylor lautner okay fine so we like.
Hot bodies big deal but looks aren't as.
Big a big deal to girls as they are to.
Guys yeah but you girls are the reason.
For that how was this our fault you.
Pretend like you guys don't care about.
Looks yet what do you do every single.
Morning you put on makeup sometimes.
Throughout the entire day you get your.
Hair done or did is some might say and.
You care about it so much and you don't.
Even let us guys crack a window in the.
Car.
Not to mention shopping what about it.
Girls love to go shopping because.
They're into buying materialistic things.
That make them look good whether it's a.
Dress or shoes or nail pain it's polish.
That - oh yeah and don't girl see that.
The one thing a guy should never do is.
Call the girl fat obviously but you can.
Call guys fat and they usually don't.
Care but if you call a girl fat they get.
Extremely hurt you know why because.
Girls care that much more about their.
Physical appearance therefore proving.
That girls are more shallow than guys.
Music.
All right here's one go for it in a.
Relationship the girl usually cares way.
More than the guy since when okay well.
Let's start small remember when i got my.
Haircut earlier this week what why are.
You moving oh here sit here fix it with.
A comb not your hands and what does your.
Hair look so weird today anyway well at.
Least i noticed it was different right.
Music.
Applause.
And you know it was one example and like.
I said shallow mad because i didn't.
Notice your haircut it's not about the.
Haircuts the fact that you didn't care.
Enough to notice a difference just like.
That one time you came over.
Hey what up g my dog just died it was a.
Hit and run oh so sorry.
See i was thoughtful i cared just to.
Finish the flashback hey yeah do you.
Have any more hot pockets in the freezer.
No yeah you're right that so insensitive.
I should just go check myself mighty.
Fans you didn't have any left so it was.
Kinda even you just stopped using those.
Examples we're talking about.
Relationships not us ah okay fine well.
When it comes to relationships break up.
Show a lot about how much people care.
It's true and once again girls care more.
That is press pause buress you mean.
Preposterous you know what i meant.
Oh yeah look there's no easy way to say.
This but i don't think it's working out.
Huh what a huge relief alright then just.
Disregard that last text.
Music.
You can't use that that never happened.
It's just an example it happens to girls.
All the time.
Text breakup i've never even heard of.
That this one's made up well let's just.
See you takes a break-up harder the guy.
Or the girl maybe i should call back i.
Need to call her back i'll have all my.
Hot pockets there and after some time.
Passes let's see who really cared about.
The relationship hello.
Toile going to the club tonight you.
Want to come oh man my girl just broke.
Up oh sorry to hear that man.
So bar that sounds good look maybe i.
Didn't notice a haircut or two and maybe.
I wasn't as caring as i should have been.
When i accidentally ran over your dog.
Wait wait but it's only because we get.
Along so well you like a homie i've just.
Always treated you like one of the guys.
I guess sometimes i forget that you're a.
Girl too.
Gee thanks look i get it guys have been.
Asking to you in the past but think of.
All the guys who choose to date you know.
Not all guys are like that and.
Hypothetically speaking if we were to.
Ever for whatever reason be in a real.
Relationship together i wouldn't i could.
Never do something like that to someone.
I care about so much because that would.
Just be prosperous look gee i know.
You've been looking everywhere and i.
Don't understand why you can't seem to.
Find a guy they can see how amazingly.
Rare you are but maybe.
Maybe you've just been looking in the.
Wrong place yeah sure.
Some guys do you care.
Oh yeah you just admitted it guys care.
For that does make you look better.
I guess when it comes to relationships.
Guys have the event.
Music.
Yeah that was really weird yeah you're.
Right it's not do that you know i think.
We should just stick to being friends.
What a relief.
Disregard that last night so thank you.
