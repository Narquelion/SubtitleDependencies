It was a channel that you actually.
Started with roy.
Mmm-hmm who is what's his glob.
Squabble juice yeah he has his own.
Channel as well and you're still pretty.
Active mm-hmm i mean i mean i know at.
One point you were doing.
You're almost daily right yeah i was.
Doing daily you slow down yeah that was.
Just crazy.
It was crazy yeah it was not worth it.
Like the numbers are way up but how long.
Did you keep that up for i think like.
Every day like yeah like six times a.
Week cuz i've missed days yeah okay well.
What else is new we were just talking.
About i don't know how us to bring it up.
But you just had a little boxing match.
I'm weird just talking about that so.
It's weird because i want to read bring.
That up though so you just had a boxing.
Match with i didn't know this with busey.
Yeah it was far more as a sport i don't.
Know that's no they just told me right.
Before you got here yeah and i was like.
Oh i didn't even know that happened why.
Don't you tell me and apparently he did.
But i i don't recall ryan likes to.
Ignore me when i yeah but i mean so you.
You boxed him where did that come from.
So first like i used to like play around.
And like train a little bit nothing.
Serious and then so i knew a little bit.
About boxing and he said he wanted to.
Spar me on his live stream a long time.
Ago like a couple months ago i was like.
All right so he's part of in his live.
Stream and i like just messing with him.
A lot and he was doing horrible and so.
Then he trained a couple weeks and he's.
Like hey i've been training let's spar.
Again and i'm like okay let's far but.
Like you know sparring is like 70% you.
Go like 70% or 60 but when we both got.
In there we just started swinging i.
Think i turned it up at the beginning.
Cuz i was like trying to keep him away.
Cuz i knew he was bigger and heavier and.
He had the power heads he's big yeah.
He's a big dude how much heavier is he.
Uh he likes to say he's 10 pounds.
Heavier but he's like 15 at least that's.
Unfair right i mean i mean if they're.
Just sparring yeah but you weren't.
Sporting we were that's like yeah were.
You guys was there any like was it.
Called.
Trash-talker yeah i mean were you guys.
Like fighting like on friendly terms or.
Like oh yeah i mean was there some kind.
Of beef there no.
There's no beef we were just fighting.
For fun and then we both just kept.
Turning it up and then he started.
Swinging as hard as he could and he got.
Me because i didn't have any defense or.
Anything cuz i knew how to like throw a.
Punch but i didn't know how to dodge.
Dodge i didn't know how to like put.
Power in it i just knew like the basics.
So you have like a any lasting effect.
From that no big black did you black out.
I didn't black out because like when you.
Get punched if you get knocked out yeah.
You don't you don't feel it yeah it's.
Like wake up on the ground you're like.
Ah i must have lost i never got punched.
That hard i was a little i was like.
Actually like a little foggy for like a.
Couple hours after but yeah other than.
That there's nothing did you at any.
Point during the fight feel a little bit.
Of anger no but if i would have made it.
Past that big punch i would have been.
Like oh he's going 100% it's game time.
But i didn't do you think suzy was you.
In that first round you were you're.
Punching him a lot and then the second.
Round he went to his corner and the.
Coaches were like hey okay he's keeping.
You away just break through take the.
Punches and just get in there and just.
Get them and he did what did your corner.
Say my corner was just like he dortch.
Doing like he can't do anything we.
Didn't expect him to come out like that.
I was not prepared but now i mean i've.
Watched the footage i think i'm prepared.
You learned from it yeah i think i'm.
Pretty good now because you said okay so.
You guys box yeah and then you are you.
Sparred and then he trained after that.
For sparring.
Yeah then this happened yeah now okay so.
It's analogy yeah now i i'm down this.
Farm again.
Oh yeah i mean do you have more fear.
Since that has happened no i have more.
Awareness like i've watched the footage.
A bunch of times i'm never gonna be like.
This again and that's it like but i.
Think watching the footage once you see.
What you did wrong just fixing himself i.
Mean that's a silly thing like he's so.
Much bigger than he is and it also.
Brings me to question.
Because you were talking hella trash.
Back in the day to guess i and i know.
Him he's huge he's way because i don't.
Know but he's huge gigantic man i don't.
1 you're crazy like do you want.
To get hurt like i could i think i could.
Put up a good match but he is heavier.
Like we know the thing is you could.
Probably tag him.
Yeah but i think i think if he tags you.
Once it's gonna hurt a lot yes arm.
Wrestle him basically two people two of.
Us arm wrestle him and we at the same.
Time yeah at the same time we couldn't.
Barely the same so freaking strong it's.
Crazy what do you mean at the same time.
Like we had well i had one arm and derek.
Had the other arm and we just tried to.
Arm wrestle him and he'd like well he.
Derek beat him but i lost him it took.
Like so long he's just so strong it's.
Okay how about since you know how strong.
Yeah i can arm wrestle you too okay.
We'll do that at the end of the podcast.
And i'll be like oh you know what maybe.
Okay wait so you think how much do you.
Think he weighs like 200 he's got to be.
At least 200 i'm gonna say right thank.
Him and logan fought at 190 so well how.
Much do you know there's no way he's 190.
He's huge what are you what is your.
Weight right now right now i'm like 175.
But do you cut to get there no i.
Actually been trying to put on weight.
I'm usually at 170 naturally i'm gonna.
Guess their natural weight is like 200.
Something yeah but okay well youtuber.
And influencers like fighting like i.
Love fighting but i'll never fight like.
I mean i don't know how it's just fun.
You get to get in there it's all on you.
Alright usually keep me up back at then.
He's like hey let's go do this let's go.
Fight i was like no no you're so much.
Stronger than me like what the hell and.
Your help helbig like i see your.
Instagram post i'm like naturally i'm.
Like 160 like 160 okay i would say if.
I'm in shape though i actually a little.
Heavier mm-hmm but naturally out like in.
The 60s but i shouldn't be that heavy so.
You think i'm too you're too big not me.
I'm too small to go against ksi so i.
Think i think.
If you i mean yeah you'd have to yell i.
Don't think i can both because you can't.
Like yeah it wouldn't worry he'll and.
He's just naturally big dude yeah but so.
Is load about edgy i don't know actually.
I've never met him i think i think.
You're shorter and lighter yeah whatever.
That's a good yeah i'm here to talk.
Trash to him i don't know i maybe one.
Day i don't actually train well even.
Like well you we were saying like even.
Like that even though it's like 15.
Pounds doesn't seem like a lot like 15.
Pounds of muscle like natural you know.
Build is a lot and it can be like.
Dangerous you know that's what you do.
Yeah i thought it was funny because um.
During that time when all that was.
Happening like we talked i was like.
Saying the same thing i was like i'm not.
Gonna fight you dude you're way bigger.
Than i am and and then rice come hit me.
Up and he's like hey you one do this.
That's not safety and that's not funny.
Then i look like a if i wait i'm a bad.
Guy if i lose it's embarrassing you know.
He's like a lot i mean well maybe he's a.
Really good boxer i don't know he's.
Pretty good he's got the reach you know.
But we were at my house one time you.
Boxed him no oh i was like right do a.
Pull-up and he couldn't get off the.
Ground.
Yeah first morgs now you maybe was.
Messing with you i know alex can only do.
Two bullets do you have a prior fighting.
Or training experience like did you do.
What did you do sports in high school no.
You look like you play soccer actually.
You're really good at basketball - yeah.
That's it.
I was lighting the boxing's i feel like.
I'm potential yeah cuz i'll do like jab.
Steps and like the fakes and stuff see.
Like you know who would be a good match.
Actually i'm not for boxing basket boys.
If he played kev good he's good he's.
Good and you guys are like same height.
And like similar builds kids kids a.
Little skinnier right now but i don't.
Know i think that would be a good.
Matchup let's do it.
And if he if he starts beating you you.
Just punch him and it turns into a.
Boxing match you know do that yeah but.
Um so i'm curious because you did a.
Little bit of boxing or at least.
Experimenting with in and stuff do you.
Like how much more respect in that.
Aspect do you have for like fighters.
Does that grow also when you're walking.
Around and you see people threatening.
You oh well it's more yeah i've got a.
Lot of respect for fighters wait what do.
You mean by three who's threatening who.
Just people step up or try to punk oh.
Cuz there's been a time where actually.
Have it we bring up this story here so.
Essentially so i used to work for alex.
And there's one vidcon where we were.
Walking back to our room yeah and in the.
Lobby near the elevators this one like.
Like black kid was like swinging this.
Girl around by her hair what yeah like.
Yeah she grabbed her by the hair and it.
Was like dragging her around and like.
Swing her around and i didn't notice.
This at first we had another person with.
Us kyle he's like hey stop that look and.
I was like oh i was like cut that and.
Before i could finish cut that out alex.
It's printed over there pick that kid up.
By the neck with one hand like up.
Against the wall and i was like how are.
You that strong and then i got kicked.
Out of the hotel we're protecting a girl.
Well i think i've got a little gressive.
Yeah but he was literally swinging her.
Around that's a great that sounds a.
Little aggressive.
I asked why later i went back to the.
Corrals why was he doing that as she.
Said because she threw water on his face.
From her water bottle and he overreacted.
Well she probably shouldn't have done.
That either.
Not the appropriate response yeah why.
Did she do that i don't know it was just.
00 in the morning they were tired.
Mm-hmm.
I guess picked up a person with one hand.
Maybe yes i don't know so poppy you.
Mentioned that you worked with alex yeah.
Yeah it was him and roy mm-hmm yeah are.
You guys are you guys you guys are cool.
Right yeah okay a basketball like almost.
Every week every other week right it's.
Pretty good too right yeah rose good.
Yeah i remember we played at the is a.
Thing i was like surprised and like oh.
You actually know what he's doing he's.
Unpredictable yeah what he's about to do.
Pretty quick you might have answered.
This a few times already quite a few.
Times but i don't really know the.
History of you and roy but i just.
Briefly know that you guys work together.
You started something and then you you.
Broke apart he first started he made a.
Youtube channel and he had all his.
Friends come on and there's like there's.
A bunch of us there's like eight of us i.
Think and we're just all friends or just.
Making silly videos and then the other.
Guys in the group decided to go talk to.
Girls or start doing sports and me and.
Roy were like the normal things just.
Make more videos like sonia roy stayed.
In it and then we did it for a few years.
And then it took off and then we moved.
Here we just film in and doing stuff but.
Then as we got older we like both wanted.
To do different things than what we were.
Doing but he wanted to go into gaming.
And then eventually interlake what he.
Does now and then i wanted to get more.
Lifestyle and more vloggy so we just.
Split up and then he's doing his own.
Thing and they're both doing good yeah.
We still hang out do you feel like at.
The point of separation though do you.
Feel like there's a lot of tension.
Between you guys and to the point where.
You guys split apart yet to have that.
Space and then that space created that.
That absence created fondness and that's.
Kind of like how i actually think we're.
Better friends now then we were back.
Then because it's not work.
Yeah when we see each other we're not.
Like we don't have a schedule we're just.
Like there to play basketball or they're.
Out of.
And just hang out and talk so yeah it.
Took a while but it's i think it's.
Better now yeah so you're you're living.
Right now with your brother yeah i'm.
With my brother and matt my man but.
You're so your brother is also he makes.
Videos too right yeah yeah and he's like.
Pretty popular how much how many.
Subscribers does he have over a million.
For sure yeah yeah and okay so oh i.
Didn't know he was doing it that long.
Five years that's that's a long time.
He's yeah he's been her own he's been.
Doing it we live i just got a new house.
Oh yeah yeah he's moving with me and.
Matt's moving with me and then jp all.
Right on so okay and my mom sometimes.
She's there so but we're with your.

Youtube stuff you know there's always.
Speculation and shipping between people.
And people like ship yeah.
Shipping it ship him with the naming of.
The ronron or whatever and stuff and.
Then recently you started to do videos.
With her sister oh what vanessa.
Me yes i said yeah i saw you wrote.
Something on twitter i don't know where.
It was but you're like my fake.
Girlfriend yeah like that so what is.
That about everybody was shipping us.
Together all the time and were like so.
Let's just play into it instead of like.
Being like no no let's just so your.
Brother is being shipped with veronica.
And you're bitching so like whoever if.
This were to happen whoever were to get.
Married first is like incestual cuz like.
You know i'm saying i always wonder what.
That like if you were a your brothers.
Are to marry each other that's incest.
Like that's your step as true of your.
Step something but like you see like.
Sometimes twins will marry other sway no.
But like whoever gets married first.
You're like marrying your family but.
Like exact same.
I'm a great question yeah i mean no no.
We have to find some twins at hairy.
Twins okay so i mean where does that.
Stem from any truth like do you guys.
Have anything going on oh i would have.
Never had anything going on like i guess.
We've been flirting before but never on.
Line like four cameras or just flirty.
People wow right it's just like this is.
How we talked so i don't know we started.
I made a music video like she's my fake.
Girlfriend now she's my fake.
Ex-girlfriend so i made a video like.
Sneaking into my fake ex-girlfriends.
Birthday party.
But it's obvious that we're died but.
Yeah they can tell that it's obvious but.
They still were like maybe would you.
Date her i would bring this up cuz uh.
There was a i think at a convention.
Awhile ago or something someone said if.
You were to date three youtubers or.
Something who would it be and she was.
One that you mentioned i believe and the.
Other two was ryan yes remember the.
Collab we did in vegas ed you flo.

Whatever yeah all the comments just gay.
Gay the point of the joke but like yeah.
We have our own we have our own ship.
Going on yeah wait who are the other.
Ones though vanessa a youtube way this.
Was a long time ago but i do remember.
The nessa the name was one of them okay.
So i have to list three youtube girls i.
Would date it you guys have to do it too.
I would think of him but i can't really.
He doesn't know.
Damn i was a lot he keeps me up to date.
Actually put it out there are you dating.
Right now though yeah you know with.
Someone right now you're just beating.
What kind of girls what kind of girls.
Are you into half-asian pappas really oh.
Like you're selling you yeah you love.
Yourself that's why a lot of a couple.
They look similar very very true yeah.
Yeah wait so you're you really did.
You're you're like set you like half.
Asian.

Like i like exotic oh i like mixes like.
Exotic like it's like what is you what.
About is yeah.
What about mixes do you do you like it's.
Nice to look or just a uniqueness and.
The exotic know how those are.
Good-looking usually they're it always.
Ends up like an interesting combo like.
They have like asian eyes but they look.
White it's very like different i think.
There's something when i first maybe i.
Didn't know you were part asian to be.
Honest oh yeah some people in in like.
Elementary school people i guess i.
Didn't settle into my asian this yet and.
They just thought i was a white dude.
Again your bad filipino have felt you.
Don't have your mom is just ripping away.
I've seen you post oh i had no idea.
There were so many filipinos and you.
Guys you and roy grew up in north.
Carolina yeah we did yeah there's a lot.
Communities everywhere yeah it's just.
Nice like there is like so there was a.
Lot of us but like when we got together.
There's alone and then in my class i was.
Like the only asian in every class yeah.
It's like magnet suit because there may.
Not be a lot but they somehow find.
Themselves coming together type of thing.
I heard i don't know if this is true or.
Not but in charlotte that there's a lot.
Of racism towards asians there is that.
True um i don't know it's like well have.
You experienced racism growing up not.
Actually because i would ask roy because.
You hope yeah yeah we uh the school i.
Went to was like 80% african-american.
Temporarily or maybe like 70% african.
20% caucasian and then 10% miscellaneous.
Like you know god roy do you think that.
Contributed to why you guys stay on.
Youtube i don't know maybe possibly.
Sounds i mean that's kind of sounds like.
Me and sean honestly like kind of like.
Losers yeah yeah we didn't go out like.
You know to parties and stuff that we.
Didn't like do bad thing but we're.
Drinking is a little kids and we just.
Made stay at home made videos yeah.
Bored i didn't have a car like where am.
I gonna go let's make a video town even.
When we had a car we stayed home yeah we.
Were losers okay.
Well that's interesting yeah.
How do you i have a question yeah.
Brought to you by ninja milk what's your.
Question i'd be a good match for do you.
Know anybody vanessa.
Actually yeah well let me ask you this.
What kind of girls are you into besides.
Besides the physical hapa look like what.
Kind of person i think cares about the.
Look that's all that matters.
Numbers no matter personality no matter.
How many people i know it means i know.
That a passion or they're like working.
Toward something hmm like and they're.
Not like making excuses like they're.
Just they're like doing it they got.
Drive yeah and so like that they always.
They're like oh do this i'm like oh girl.
And then do you like do you like when.
The girls have more energy or more.
They're more like reserved i like funny.
So like i don't care as long as they.
Make me laugh it's what type of funny.
Goofy funny.
Dry funny goofy witty witty funny.
Jokester yeah not afraid to look stupid.
But also like smart too yeah hmm vanessa.
Gosh i don't really know they're like.
Three times yeah i don't know your other.
Two like you didn't okay the other two.
Music.
Laughter.
Music.
On the spot i can just go back to other.
Things and i mean let's go back to your.
Content because a lot of your content.
You know it is lifestyle and a lot of.
Times it will be about girls or you'll.
Have a lot of like girls in your videos.
And you're aware that you know it can.
Bring views mm-hmm and what is your.
Thought process when constructing video.
Ideas you know because uh you're talking.
About you know trying to come up with.
Like better ideas and that's always.
Thing you're trying to top yourself in a.
Way so i guess well it's just like.
Just whatever go is going on in my life.
You'll see it on the vlog so i don't.
Have much going on or if i'm like not.
Motivated you can tell it's bad but when.
I am motivated i'll make videos and.
They're better and like this or like.
That but a lot of people think i make.
Videos because about love and about.
Girls about cute stuff because my fans.
Like that and they do like that but.
That's not the reason i'm making it it's.
Because i really am always looking for.
Love i'm always on the search for the.
Ones like hey there you are.
Done that i'd be happy then ever every.
Videos about her yeah i mean it would be.
Yeah my life with a revolver on whenever.
I find the one my life is gonna revolve.
Around her you're a romantic.
Yeah so you're really into uh i'm.
Guessing you like romance films like not.
Straight romance movies cause you watch.
The old book i watch like we're gonna.
Take comedy rom-com yeah action romance.
Never just romance you see why there's.
Nothing wrong with that you ever watch.
The notebook.
Okay i do ask the notebook for a walk to.
Remember a lot of people will say like.
Love will find you like when you're not.
Searching you know when you're waiting.
But i also think it's difficult for you.
Because liger you're like you're a very.
Attractive guy objectively and oh but.
Anyways you're um you're an objectively.
Like very attractive person you know and.
You're very charismatic so i'm sure a.
Lot of girls are very infatuated with.
You they're interested they want to get.
To know you more so you have to like go.
Through and like weed them out tough.
Problem man you're almost like la la.
Girl's frustrating because i've heard.
That was that they always want something.
More early want something else or like.
They want.
Oh why don't you tell ventually they're.
Always like why don't you tag me in that.
Story oh you should post this picture of.
I don't like girls don't tell me what to.
Post so the ulterior motives yeah like.
They know like they enjoy like i'm sure.
They and we have fun together but then.
They're also like keeping an eye on like.
I could get numbers yeah i'm this too so.
Make me bert there you go how many.
Girlfriends serious girlfriends have you.
Had okay i'm sure you've dated a lot but.
Let me think okay serious serious i.
Would count so over a year there's one.
High school doesn't count that she.
Doesn't calendar okay so there's vanessa.
Shanna daniela.
On glass they don't know they don't.
Watch me loren's the the youtuber we.
Yeah yeah at the most recent.
She's a hispanic youtuber no i didn't.
I've never heard of her either but we we.
Met up and then it was awesome how long.
Was that too much issue unless there's a.
Quick quick one with lauren for a little.
Bit three years is that your longest.
Yeah as a long time your shortest is two.
Months i think so.
Probably but that two months was magical.
Mm-hmm would you say everything has been.
Magical though for you because you're.
Such a hopeless romantic you might.
Romanticize that you age i do i every.
Time i'm in a relationship they're.
Always like man it's like a movie and.
I'm like i know.
I'll run outside just cuz it's raining.
And she'll chase me i'll do it like i'll.
Show up i'll be like what would they do.
It over the cheesy dream guy that girls.
Love yeah yeah what would you say is the.
Biggest lesson you learned about.
Yourself and about what you like from.
Your past relationships oh that's a deep.
One what's the biggest thing i learned.
About myself.
Is i i realized that i go for the.
Perfect girl but there's no perfect girl.
Like everybody's gonna have problems or.
Everybody's gonna be different so you.
Have to adapt you can't just find.
Somebody perfect for you you gotta find.
Somebody and then you guys gotta adapt.
Together and become the perfect person.
So that's what was the second part of.
The question weight in terms of what you.
Like in a girl what you i guess what you.
Don't like you know because the more you.
Date the more girlfriend's you have the.
More you kind of refine what what you.
Want yourself and then what you want in.
The other person yes well people they're.
Always like why are you always dating.
Youtubers oh wait the last three like.
The last two were youtubers and then.
Like girls i dated they're uh they're.
Often youtubers gotcha because they're.
Just like i just vibe with them because.
They're like funny and like they're.
Witty and they're quick and it's like.
They're ready for camera all the time.
Yeah yeah they don't understand your.
Struggles like oh like uploading times.
Yeah doing well the algorithm and like.
I'm on my phone tweeting or instagram.
They know i'm working yeah even though.
Like somebody's not a youtuber doing.
That it's not working does it cross your.
Mind that like you know i'm sure it does.
To a certain degree where it's like man.
We can help each other too in our work i.
Mean like being together being in a.

What's your training regimen is it just.
Boxing well i mean i tried a box but.
It's more lifting so like i've been.
Lifting which everybody tells me if you.
Spar again it's gonna make you a lot.
Slower it's more slower could it make.
You like you could be a little bit.
Slower but not that one's slower from.
Lifting cuz i'm just too skinny i need.
To get some size you're actually not.
That skinny though i mean like i was.
Saying you got a lot bigger but maybe.
That is maybe that is making you slower.
Mm-hmm i don't know phousi was i mean.
He's a big dude he's a big dude but i.
Should have seen that guy have you ever.
Been in a fight outside of this this.
Boxing uh no not really cuz like i've.

Something will break it up or my mom.
Will be like style.
Hey when was this in your household my.
Brother like started like something like.
It gets stopped or like any fight i get.
Stopped even at a club like i've had.
People kicked out before but good but.
It's cuz like they're trying to come in.
To my table or something and then the.
Bouncer will grab them so right it never.
Escalated past that but i don't i don't.
Want it to escalate past that i don't.
Think i've ever been in that scenario.
You've been like the whole pushing thing.
Never ever.
Well i punched a girl in the stomach.
Once as a kid but that's it i was in.
Kindergarten she cut the line okay.
Actually in kindergarten one time i was.
A girl no but i slapped that girl's butt.
Wow i didn't know it was a sexual thing.
I was a door holder and i took my job.
Very good job mate yeah and no and like.
You have to run ahead of the line hold.
The door and then when the last rows out.
You got to go to the next door hold the.
Door so i got there and this one girl.
Was dilly dally and hard and at the end.
I was like come on and pop and then she.
Hurried up and i was like done and then.
I like ran to the next door my teacher.
Guy was like don't ever do that and i.
Was like i'm sorry i just didn't want to.
Miss the next door i didn't know and i.
Didn't know yeah now i would never do.

Unless she was really dilly dallying.
Laughter.

Questions here mm you ready i think so.
So here's one from believe alex mmm how.
Do you deal with the recent hate you got.
From the ksi army mmm so maybe maybe.
Give us a little background on what yeah.
What does that mean yusef phousi sparred.
Case i reacted to it and he made an.
Entire video about me oh he's my biggest.
Fan and he told all his fans to go to my.
Instagram and comment cloud emojis so.
Like i had like a thousand comments on.
My newest picture and then he.
He commented that and it got over like.
150,000 comments of clowns wow so after.
The next day i was like what should i do.
And then so i put a change the caption.
After 150,000 people commented and said.
Comment if you're my biggest fan coming.
Clown so now they're all like go no to.
Retracted a lot of great a lot of the.
Comments are like oh he got us this time.
But we'll get on i'm sure your.
Engagement did well on that big so why.
Why did he call you a clown just cuz i.
Challenged him before yeah yeah asked.
What so why um where is this i mean i.
Know there's history between you two we.
Had ksi on i don't think he'd he.
Mentioned demons alex i don't think so.
Yeah he didn't really mention it but um.
I know i couldn't remember if there was.
Actual like dislike there or if it was.
Just like an internet thing well where's.
That stem from you and ksi why is that a.
Thing i remember is it because you said.
You want to fight him but it wasn't in.
Like a bad way like you were yeah i.
Don't know i just i think i wanted to.
Spar and then i i think just the way.
They go about talking about things or.
Like doing things and just makes me mad.
Cuz like makes you mad it makes me mad.
Cuz like they're just like they they're.
Not classy about anything they're more.
Like i would stomp you in the crowd or.
Like you're whatever and then i'm just.
Like oh i just want to spar guys so then.
It got into it and then deji started.
Commenting on the breakup with me and.
Lauren and then lauren got mad it got.
Personal.
Yeah i saw lauren get mad and that.
Triggered me to get mad and i was trying.
Not to but once you see your girl or.
Like the love of your life at the time.
Get mad that you're so you have to jump.
In so it was real anger and hate then i.
Don't know it's gotta be cuz i mean you.
Seem like i did i thought it was you.
Guys were just doing a thing like you.
Know i really didn't know we asked kiss.
That same thing with his whole thing.
With mugen and he actually said we asked.
Him could you ever be friends with logan.
No he said he could be friends with.
Logan he thinks in the future how it.
Would never be friends with jake he.
Genuinely hates him what yeah strange.
But i was wondering the same thing with.
You do you think you and.
Yes i could ever be homies yeah i think.
I think if we all if we ever saw each.
Other in person like me cuz i'd edgy.
Whoever like everybody's fine with each.
Other just online it's just there's like.
Oh hey you don't like no i don't i don't.
Hate anybody.
I probably dislike nobody i don't know i.
Don't hate anybody like nobody it's all.
In person i would be like i don't want.
To see you or i don't want to be in the.
Same room or are there people in your.
Past that you know on your come up that.
Kind of like talk down to you or roy and.
You're like i'm gonna show them and i.
Guess when you got to that point did you.
Feel like oh yeah like i'm better than.
Them or you kind of just like you let it.
Go cuz you're like i'm too busy with the.
Kind of thing yeah i mean i never got.
Inspired by haters so like i did have.
Friends in high school that were like.
Like all the guys that were in wasabi.
That left to go talk to girls in sports.
They super regretted it they all they.
Probably all have asked me to if i could.
Hire them to do something like after.
College they're like can i be your.
Assistant can i do this i don't like oh.
Man i can't then i had to move you out.
Here then at the patriot shelter where.
You gonna live who's gonna your shelter.
Like oh yeah i don't have money so then.
I'm like i can't i have to focus on this.
So i don't know i i don't think i ever.
Was like ah in your face yeah so are you.
Gonna box ksi i would take cuz is dead.
Ge i don't think he's fighting is he i.
Don't see me to do my research but i.
Don't know either from what i saw.
Logan's boxing ksi and the under cards.
All real boxers yeah like real fights.
Not that you guys are in real fights but.
Like actual professional boxers which is.
Interesting and i kind of like that what.
Their explanation is like they want to.
Expose you know real boxing to a.
Different audience yeah i think that's.
Cool but like i don't know where i don't.
Know anything else about like where.
Everyone else is fighting i don't even.
Know when you and phousi fought like i.
Don't know about that that was like note.
Involved for me at all was just having.
Fun and let's go see what happens.
But i would box deji cuz he's not.
Training for anything i think i could.
Take him like i don't think did you ever.
Call did you call him out yet no i don't.
Know that's someone you wanna fight i.
Would yeah oh it's borrowed edgy well i.
Don't know if i would do it in an event.
It'd just be for fun anyone else you.
Want to spar um ryan but he said no if i.
If i like took some classes and stuff.

Right now i mean i have to learn you.
Gotta teach me how to do it first.
You had an all-time low actually spot.
Right now as if it was like giving me.
Cuz then i you can use boxing and then i.
Can use but it'd be interesting i mean.
Are you guys like i guess he's bigger.
Than me i think a little bit taller and.
That's the only reason i'm heavier we.
Weight-wise know he's also more muscular.
