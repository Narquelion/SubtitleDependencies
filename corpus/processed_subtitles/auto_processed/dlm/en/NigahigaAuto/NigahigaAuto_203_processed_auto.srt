Hey guys so i just watched that video.
Called friday by rebecca black when i.
Was in a loss for words for words what.
The hell with that the song is terrible.
The lyrics are terrible and i became.
Tear abel because the song is exactly.
Like the music i make i'm just like.
Rebecca black i can't sing so i oughta.
To myself when i write lyrics i.
Basically just talk about what i do on a.
Daily basis and yes the crap i put out.
Gets a million views but dean army of.
You she got more so unlike everyone else.
I'm not gonna say that she's a failure.
Because she has over thirty five million.
Views in a month how many views do your.
Videos get i can't beat that nobody can.
Beat that unless you're one of these or.
These huh or even haha charlie sheen.
When you think about it the lyrics.
Aren't horrible ish she was just being.
Honest the whole time i love fridays and.
I do look forward to the weekend.
Especially if i get the party with the.
Kids from kidz bop party and party and.
Yeah and actually she was absolutely.
Right by my mathematics and today we're.
Friday yesterday would be thursday.
Tomorrow would be saturday and.
Afterwards well let's just say you won't.
Need an umbrella because it's sunday.
Shut up kids bob nobody even likes you.
But there was one line in the song that.
Tickled my mind a little bit.
Tickle tickle my mind she goes wee wee.
Wee.
So inside ted what is that some kind of.
Cheap shot at asians just because we.
Don't know how to speaking the good.
That's racist just like that girl i met.
In the library last week i don't know.
Why i'm here i don't know how to read oh.
You thought it was gonna be alexandra.
Wallace no not every race is going a.
Library is her you're being sexist or.
Alexandra waller ris walrus oh that was.
An otter.

Supposed to mean.
That's your language yes but that's a.
Completely different dialect and why do.

Ping pong cheech and chong y'all mean.
Shut up i don't even speak pennies.

Oh and yes that was a library didn't you.
See the book anyway to summarize the.
Music video is absolutely amazing if you.
Haven't seen it yet and that's okay.
