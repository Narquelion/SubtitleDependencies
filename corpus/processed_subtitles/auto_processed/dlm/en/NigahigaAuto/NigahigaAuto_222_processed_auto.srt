I'm just gonna grow it out both the.
Beard and the hair i'm growing it out.
Really hates it see he's mad hey guys so.
I'm gonna be talking about one of the.
Biggest trends that exist today.
Prank videos and i'm sure you guys.
Already know but right now prank videos.
Are like the most watched videos that.
Are online and i mean i get why.
I personally always love pranks pranks.
Are always gonna be a big thing but.
Lately i feel like there's just so many.
Prank videos out there.
We've seen all the best pranks it's.
Really hard to come up with a new.
Funnier prank because there's so many.
Funny pranks out there and because.
There's such an over.
Saturation of these pranks prankers are.
Being forced to step their game up.
They're all trying to top each other and.
Of course not all of them but i feel.
Like a lot of these prankers are just.
Going way too far to the point where.
They're not even pranks anymore they're.
Just straight-up crimes some prankers.
Are like going on the streets and.
They're like calling.
Out random guys to fight or like.
Grabbing random girls butts.
I've even seen a video of some guys.
Throwing fake bombs at people because i.
Guess terrorism and.
Murder is so hilarious like that's not.
Even funny that's just like shocking the.
Only way that these so-called pranks are.
Not crimes or if they're staged or fake.
But that's like a whole other story.
We'll talk about that later anyway it is.
Getting ridiculous and not in the good.
Way pranks used to be good.
Innocent fun nobody got hurt or sexually.
Assaulted or.
Bombed thrown at them and i don't know.
Maybe i was just brought up differently.
But you just don't prank people that you.
Don't know you prank your friends.
Whatever happened to the good.
Old-fashioned clean harmless prank.
Like when we were young we used to spray.
Like pam on the floor so that when.
Somebody would walk on it it'd be like.
Slippery or like the pat someone on the.
Back prank where you're really actually.
Putting a sign on them that says.
Something that would probably be.
Considered offensive today or like when.
One of your friends leave their phone to.
Go to the bathroom so you and your.
Friends grab it and hide it and then.
Basically watch them freak out a little.
Bit and then give it back or like what.
Even happened to the most innocent.
Harmless prank of all the prank call.
Hello hey is your refrigerator running.
Well you better go catch it oh my god oh.
My god do you know something.
I'm sorry what what my son he's been.
Missing have you seen him have you heard.
Something.
I don't understand please he's a little.
White fridge with abc magnets tatted on.
His lower right door.
Doesn't even have a freezer yet please.
We're so desperate.
No i i actually don't know anything.
About any friends why would you call it.
It was just.
Supposed to be a prank call my baby goes.
Missing and you think that's funny.
I i i didn't know i'm i'm sorry i'm kind.
Of sick i'm so sorry i had no idea.
I didn't know what i caught him.
You see good old-fashioned harmless.
Pranks no one gets hurt anyway lego was.
Saying pranks used to be innocent but.
Because there's so many good pranks out.
There that now you just have to do.
Something completely crazy to stand out.
Those innocent pranks you just saw.
That's what pranks look like five to ten.
Years ago but those pranks would never.
Get viewed today because they're not.
Crazy enough not those pranks came out.
Today those pranks would look like this.
Hey dude we should spray pam on the.
Floor but this time we add glass shards.
And a lemon so that when they slip and.
Fall they get cut by the glass shards.
And the lemon just goes inside of their.
Cuts.
How's it going sean working harder.
Hardly.
Fire working working hardly working.
I'll be right back.
Dude look he left his phone you know we.
Should do we should hide it.
But this time let's not give it back.
Yeah.
And we'll take his wallet too yeah.
And you know what we'll take his truck.
All right let's go wait we're taking his.
Phone his wallet.
And his truck and not giving it back is.
This even funny.
Music.
Dude we should take his mini fridge yeah.
That's a prank what do you guys do hey.
Mom.
Sad part is i'm not even exaggerating.
That much these primes probably already.
Exist somewhere sorry.
Not pranks these are crimes there's so.
Many pranks these days that are actually.
Crimes that people think it's okay.
So many people these days think that.
Just by saying the infamous lion who's.
Just a prank that they can get away with.
Whatever they want and those people.
Are absolutely right.
What it was just a prank oh okay then.
What the hell just the prank broke third.
One.
Music.
It was just the prank oh.
Hey it's just a prank.
What it was just a prank bro.
Music.
Oh dude too far that's a rocket launcher.
I'm sorry man i.
Didn't realize it was you shot that way.
Too far i'm right here.
It was a good one though right yeah a.
Good one but what do you think is going.
To happen to that rocket though.
Hey we're taking mom.
No.
It was just a prank no i don't think it.
Was what do you mean you just blew up.
Two people in a fridge.
That's not a prank oh that's a social.
Experiment.
It's just an experiment i'm done come on.
Like before people get all defensive of.
Their favorite prankers i'm not talking.
About all prankers i got a lot of close.
Friends that make prank videos and.
They're still successful without having.
To commit crimes in their pranks i'm.
Just talking about the ones that will do.
Whatever it takes to top their last.
Prank and i'm not gonna name names they.
Know who they are we all do they're.
Willing to either break the law or.
Stage their pranks in order to get views.
And yes i said it earlier prankers fake.
Pranks all the time big surprise this is.
Not news i actually have no problem with.
Stage pranks if they're still.
Entertaining what i do have a problem.
With is when they lie and say that it's.
Real when it's.
Obviously not real just own up to it.
It's entertainment there's nothing wrong.
With that and if you're gonna fake a.
Prank and pretend that it's real at.
Least put in the effort to make it look.
Real it blows my mind how many of these.
Videos i've seen that are so obviously.
Fake and people in the comments don't.
Seem to catch on i mean it's pretty.
Obvious when pranks are fake you just.
Have to use common sense here's some.
Really quick tips to tell.
If a prank is fake or not for example if.
Somebody's committing a crime in a prank.
By grabbing random girls butts on the.
Street and they put it on social media.
For millions of people to see i'm sorry.
To spoil it but there's a very great.
Chance that that prank is staged because.
If not that person would be in jail.
That's video evidence of sexual assault.
That millions of people witnessed.
Another obvious sign of a fake prank.
The camera is far away but you can hear.
The pranker and the victim talking.
Clearly chances are they're both mic'ed.
Up or even the camera angles there's.
Certain shots and some pranks where.
There's absolutely no way that the.
Cameraman could get that shot without.
The victim noticing them so it's either.
Staged or they filmed that part after.
The price so basically.
It could be real but they shot it twice.
And probably the biggest giveaway is.
Blurring faces well not blurring faces.
But getting permission from the victims.
To use them in the video especially for.
Big prankers all the popular prankers.
Know that you have to get permission.
From the people that you prank in order.
To use them in a video because if you.
Don't that video is going to get removed.
Or you're probably going to get sued.
Just think about it for a second a lot.
Of times these victims they get.
Extremely mad or upset by the pranker.
Which is.
Perfectly normal they should be upset.
But the truth is the fact that we can.
See their face on video means that they.
Gave.
Consent to be on this video if somebody.
Just pranked you or.
Scared you or hurt you in in some way to.
Make you that mad why would you consent.
Letting the world look at you like an.
Idiot unless of course you were paid off.
Or.
More realistically staged there's a lot.
More little ways to tell a prank is fake.
But i.
I'm just i'm getting off topic anyway.
Fake or not pranks are going way too far.
And it's becoming a dangerous culture.
Let's stop escalating these pranks.
Before it's too late and somebody.
Actually gets killed let's just go back.
To the good old-fashioned harmless.
Innocent pranks like pam spray.
Or prank calls about your refrigerator.
Running you know the classics cause even.
Though they're pranks.
In the end everybody's still happy.
Everybody still wins and most.
Importantly.
Nobody ever gets hurt.
Kevin mama.
