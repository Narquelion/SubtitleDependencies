Hey guys so if you follow me on twitter.
Facebook snapchat all my other social.
Medias you probably already know this.
But the movie that i filmed a year ago.
Is finally coming out i'm gay also it's.
Coming out as in like you can watch it.
Online but anyway and just for those of.
You that don't already know if you do.
Choose to watch it it's not gonna be.
Like one of my videos the one this movie.
Is not a comedy it's a thriller slash.
Horror and i only acted in it i didn't.
Write it or direct it or anything.
Because if i did i probably would ruin.
This actually that thought alone kind of.
Got me thinking a lot of you guys are.
Always telling me that i should actually.
Direct real movies like mainstream.
Movies i'm telling you right now that is.
A terrible idea.
I would ruin your favorite movies and.
Not just because i will turn everything.
Into a joke but mainstream movies are.
Nothing like making these videos you.
Have crazy expensive budgets with huge.
Sets tons really good acting is just an.
All-around huge gigantic professional.
Production crew what do i have i have.
This.
See we're even better just why i think.
Some of the most expensive movies ever.
Made and recreated them to show you guys.
What they would look like on a low.
Budget and more importantly what they.
Would look like if i directed them.

Happened if you gave us these expensive.
Movies to make we'd make them better.
Obviously this wasn't serious at all one.
Day when i do make an actual legit movie.
A legit feature film it's not gonna be.
Like these ridiculous skits that's gonna.
Be a lot worse but anyway i was writing.
This video i got completely off-topic as.
Usual this video as opposed to be.
Telling you guys about the movie that i.
Did but once again i died i didn't do.
That and actually the producers of the.
Movie wanted me to do a video promoting.
You know this movie but i did this.
Instead you know why i'm not doing all.

Don't want to watch i would never do.
That i stood up to those greedy.
Producers and i said look this is my.
