Hey guys so if you follow what's going.
On in the youtube community and i'm not.
Just talking about my channel i'm.
Talking about like all of you - you've.
Probably seen some or at least heard of.
Some youtube drum and by drama i mean.
Like you know youtubers fighting online.
It's all public for everyone to see and.
I'm pretty skeptics oh at first i.
Thought you know these youtubers were.
Pairing up and agreeing to have drama so.
That you know i would create some.
Publicity for them and also you will.
Never know but i think it's real i think.
It's a hundred percent real i mean.
They're not just like tweeting like.
Snide little passive-aggressive remarks.
They're literally calling each other out.
There making dedicated vlogs to like.
Talk crap about each other i've even.
Seen some youtubers make raps about each.
Other like it's some kind of rap battle.
I think the whole drake and meek mills.
Thing i'm just sitting there thinking i.
Feel a little left out i want to be a.
Part of the drama life i cannot be with.
Someone i know how to roast i've had.
Roast beef like okay uh pewdiepie uh.
More like a buddha pie boop doop i is.
What i meant roaster que si uh what does.
That stand for kilns per square inch.
Hole jenna marbles.
More like jenna more bowls of poop de.
Pie that's measured in ksi why don't you.
Apply some water movement on your bird.
Butt up with the wat put water first to.
Clean it okay as you can see i'm not a.
Good roaster i'm a great one but as much.
As i want to be a part of the whole.
Drama scene like i don't want to fight.
With anyone i don't like confrontations.
I mean the closest thing to ever being a.
Part of the drama life was literally.
When i made a draw my life back in the.
Day when i first started like 2005-2006.
You tubers didn't really fight with each.
Other we all got along for the most part.
We help each other out you know we.
Supported one another we all collab and.
If there was drama you wouldn't.
Necessarily see people posting about it.
So publicly online i guess people are.
More open about that stuff these days.
But it's obviously completely different.
Now and i'm missing out which is why i.
Came up with this idea.
You probably already know because of the.
Title it is the roasts yourself.
Challenge it's easy to call someone out.
On something or it's easy to make fun of.
Someone else we as humans naturally do.
That we're always judging other people.
He's so sure he'll look at all that.
Girl's dress fat that guys she needs to.
Take off her makeup and put on some.
Clothes the idea behind this challenge.
Is basically to look at yourself as if.
You're another person and then do.
Exactly what the title says roast.
Yourself.
And like i said i i don't know how to do.
It exactly i think it's pretty open as.
Long as you're roasting yourself making.
Fun of yourself then i think you've done.
It you could blog roast yourself you.
Know literally do what i'm doing right.
Now but talk bad about your stuff you'd.
Create a clone character of yourself and.
Have that character roasty or you could.
Even do one of those rap battles with.
Yourself like we mentioned earlier like.
The whole meek mill and drake thing.
Except it'd be you just roasting you i.
Mean it is a little bit more work but i.
Actually think that would be the most.
Fun way to do it anyway just do it.
However you want the only rule in this.
Challenge is to make one of yourself is.
To call yourself up because like i said.
So many times before we're always so.
Quick to judge other people but a lot of.
Times we don't even realize but we have.
Just as many flaws as everyone else once.
You realize and call yourself out in.
These flaws it's a lot harder to make.
Fun of someone else's flaws so let's.
Stop the drama stop making fun of people.
Stop mocking and judging people and just.
Take a long look at ourselves just tear.
Ourselves a new one i'm ryan higa.
And this is the roast yourself challenge.
Started the game young looking back in.
Oh six yeah i wear a hat too if my head.
Were dipped in piss but i guess i.
Shouldn't hate on a kid who's relevant.
Good thing you're not anymore you thinks.
I'm right you elephant relevant like.
Television what are you been watching my.
Cell in prison oh you wanna prove me.
Wrong let's test your intelligence but.
You can do the math yourself right your.
Age what you dropped out of college you.
Couldn't make your this race through.
Your race couldn't either win a tea seal.
A button like the    i please i saw.
You crying mothers they saw a jelly.
Forgotten hotel they'd never been on.
Ellen duffy.
Watermelon spelling felon like his felon.
Is your only talent hunting talent that.
In silent allen will not tell them and.
Last but not least the best parts about.
To happen the song is finally and then.
Man i'm sick of hearing your rapping.
Transmit fire but you can skate like a.
Spare tire you are a pig you should.
Retire give it a break drink cuz you're.
Literally unimpressive and your raps are.
Saying aggressive and your flow is like.
A carpet getting worse with no.
Progressive there's only one thing that.
Could make this rap worse than it could.
Be by ending with and overused on this.
See when you roast yourself no one gets.
Hurt it's a good challenge i'm just.
Trying to make the world a better place.
So like i said earlier the next time you.
Feel the need to make fun of someone.
Take a look at yourself first if you're.
Gonna go and judge someone for something.
Then go ahead but just know that you're.
Not perfect either and you should be.
Judging yourself as well and just like.
Any challenge i'm gonna be doing some.
Call-outs to youtubers who i want to see.
Rose themselves as well but it doesn't.
Mean that you guys can't do it either in.
Fact i look forward to seeing a bunch of.
You guys do your own rose in fact yeah.
I'm calling all of you guys out as well.
But anyways specifically i'm gonna be.
Calling out a bunch of my friends to do.
This challenge that i think not only.
Would be good at it but these are all.
People i think that aren't afraid to.
Make fun of themselves and i think where.
This challenge you have to be pretty.
Confident cuz you have to be comfortable.
Calling out your flaws so with that.
