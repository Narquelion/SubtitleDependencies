So i was never gonna do a draw my life.
Video because to be honest i personally.
Don't think my life is nearly as.
Dramatic or interesting as some of the.
Other draw my life's that i've seen but.
Because a couple of you keep asking well.
Maybe more than a couple of you i am.
Going to draw my life or at least what i.
Call drawings you'll see it all started.
Off on june 6 1990 i was born in hilo.
Hawaii a small town where i grew up i.
Was lucky enough to have two loving.
Parents that i look up to even till.
Today i also have an older brother who.
I've always felt competitive with my.
Whole life.
He was always better than me and.
Everything he would beat me and.
Challenges competitions video games and.
Of course he was naturally gifted in.
Judo sea judo played a big part in my.
Family being that both my brother and i.
Pretty much did it our whole lives well.
At age 5 when i first started i hated.
You too because i was terrible at my.
Brother on the other hand was like a.
Judo club star pupil all of our senses.
Or teachers for those of you that don't.
Speak french loved him i was probably on.
The exact opposite side of the spectrum.
Anyway my brother would almost always.
Win at every tournament we entered while.
I on the other hand would be lucky to.
Place third out of three people that is.
I remember specifically hearing at a.
Tournament a man say oh this is the.
Younger higa not the good one but i.
Couldn't even get mad because it was.
True anyway in elementary school from.
Kindergarten to fifth grade i really.
Don't remember much all they can.
Remember is that i hated judo and i had.
The hugest crush on a girl not gonna say.
Her real name but let's call her nichole.
I was pretty much in love with nicole or.
At least what a seven-year-old thinks.
Love is but i was too shy and scared to.
Say anything to her until years later.
But we'll come across that later after.
Fifth grade i moved schools for middle.
School sixth grade was specifically a.
Terrible year for me not only did i lose.
All my friends because it was a new.
School but because it was a charter.
School we all had to take tests to see.
Where we would be placed i guess and for.
Some reason i got placed with the older.
Kids at the time i thought this was a.
Good thing because i thought older kids.
Would think i'm cool because i skipped a.
Grade however it was pretty much the.
Opposite so this is the part of story.
That most of you don't know about.
Because i've never really addressed it.
Publicly but i know a lot of you.
Watching this can relate so i got.
Bullied a lot you know nothing really.
Crazy just your typical getting pushed.
Down to the ground being made fun of for.
No reason and yes i remember every.
Single one of them including the worst.
Of them again not going to use a real.
Name but we'll call him richard because.
As you know another.
Richard is dick see dick was such a.
Richard to me that i'd actually make.
Excuses to my mom why i couldn't go to.
School or why i needed to change schools.
So i was heating life at the time and.
Wondering why someone so mean could be.
So popular by picking on me even got to.
The point where i had some darker.
Thoughts at the time that i think most.
If not all teenagers go through at some.
Point in their lives or perhaps it was.
Just puberty messing with my head i.
Don't know however i was able to stick.
It out and i actually found a way to end.
The bullying on my own terms i noticed.
That the reason dick was bullying me was.
To make people laugh so i figured that.
If i could make them laugh and become.
The funny guy they would stop treating.
Me like i was less than them and.
Surprisingly it worked every time they.
Made fun of me i ran within and i made.
Fun of myself even more than they could.
Kind of like that last rap battle that.
Eminem did an eight-mile except that.
Movie didn't exist at the time so he.
Pretty much stole my idea it's all good.
Though me and i'm never like best.
Friends forever now i still didn't have.
Many friends but at least i wasn't.
Getting bullied anymore but from that.
Point on i wanted to be funny i started.
Picking up my mom's vhs camcorder and.
Recording little skits and videos for my.
Family to watch they loved it of course.
Some of my cousin's would be like you.
Need to get a life ryan but it became a.
Traditional thing every sunday i'd have.
A new video for them to watch and laugh.
At in eighth grade i finally reconnected.
With nicole you know the girl i had a.
Crush on since elementary school she was.
Still at the other middle school where.
All my friends were but i somehow became.
In contact with her again through msn.
Messenger a lot of you might not know.
What that is now but it was like the.
Facebook of that time but when i finally.
Had the courage to ask her out i got.
Completely rejected no explanation no.
Excuse just a straight-up no nothing.
More and i'm not gonna lie that bothered.
Me for a long time you didn't just make.
Me sad it made me very unconfident it.
Was devastating to me at the time then.
In high school came around up until that.
Point i considered myself a complete.
Loser i always saw myself as less than.
Everyone nicole got a boyfriend i was.
Less than him my old elementary school.
Friends had found new friends and they.
Became close with i was less than them.
My brother who had just left for college.
Not only left high school with honors.
But he ended up placing second in the.
State for high school judo which as you.
Know and my family is a big deal so yeah.
I was less than him too.
That was back at square one i had a few.
Acquaintances but little to no close.
Friends even the kids i considered nerds.
Had friends they had each other in my.
Mind i wasn't anybody i was less than.
Everyone i looked forward to class more.
Than recess and lunch because at least.
That way i could sit somewhere and not.
Complete loner and then it happened one.
Of the most momentous occasions of my.
Life i joined the wrestling team and i.
Know what you're thinking wrestling is.
Just a sport well to me it wasn't it.
Literally changed my life and well.
Almost ended at the same time i remember.
This one time i had to lose roughly 16.
Pounds in a week to make my weight class.
This was by far the most i've ever had.
To lose in such a short amount of time.
So i discipline myself to survive i'm.
Half a can of tuna and roughly 32 ounces.
Of water a day pretty sure i would have.
Died had my teammate landing that.
Finally collapsed on a run sorry mom.
Just finding out about this now was.
Probably one of the hardest things i've.
Ever had to do in my life but it was by.
My own choice just to prove to myself.
That anything can be done with enough.
Effort sure enough i made it to 102.
Pounds a whole pond under my weight.
Class from that point on i felt like a.
Completely new person i didn't feel like.
A loser anymore i felt like i could get.
Anything i want to do in life as long as.
I put the work by the time high school.
Was over i was lucky enough to earn a.
State championship wrestling title and.
Just like my brother second in the state.
For judo even with a dislocated elbow i.
Had lots of friends most of which were.
Fellow wrestlers you might recognize.
Some of them for my videos i even had a.
Girlfriend no not nicole someone that i.
Thought was even more beautiful perfect.
Oh and those videos i made for my family.
Every sunday i decided to start putting.
Them on this website called youtube so i.
Wouldn't have to physically bring them a.
Copy and little did i know a few other.
People found them and started sharing.
Them as well before i knew it i was.
Consistently getting thousands of views.
Every day and comments kept telling me.
To do it so again however my parents.
Really wanted me to get a college degree.
So for the first time in my life i left.
Hawaii to attend unlv for a degree in.
Nuclear medicine i hated it i was.
Spending most of my days and nights.
Learning about something i had no.
Interest in the workload between college.
And posting youtube videos just became.
Too much and my girlfriend remained in.
Hawaii so the long-distance thing wasn't.
Helping either i realized that once.
Again i was completely stressed out and.
I'm happy so after about two years into.
College my girlfriend and i broke up and.
I finally ended up telling my parents.
That i'm dropping out to pursue this.
Youtube thing it took a little while but.
To my surprise they became completely.
Supportive and because of that thanks to.
My parents thanks to wrestling thanks to.
My bullies thanks to not only the good.
But the bad experiences in my life and.
Of course thanks to all of you watching.
Right now i am who i am today because of.
All of you like everyone i still go.
Through highs and lows but ultimately.
Completely happy this is my real life.
Story no i'm not telling you this.
Because i want to brag about my life or.
Because i want you to feel sorry for me.
Because i was bullied when i was younger.
Or whatever i'm telling you this story.
Because i know for a fact that there are.
A lot of you watching this right now.
That are going through the same things i.
Went through when i was younger and i.
Wanted to let you know that life will.
Get better if you choose to make it.
Better it's okay to be sad and angry now.
And then there are some things that may.
Be out of your control like employee.
That picks on you or a boy or girl that.
Rejects you or even a sibling that.
Outshines you but the one thing that you.
And only you control is your perspective.
And your actions being depressed and.
Feeling sorry for yourself it's easy i.
Challenge you to change that today.
Happiness is a choice choose to be happy.
Choose to better your life because only.
You can make that decision you are not.
Less than anyone there are only two.
Things that can stop you your own mind.
And your own body some might argue that.
There's a third and say your heart as.
Well but if you've been on my channel.
Long enough you already know that even.
With heart it's still less than three.
Music.
