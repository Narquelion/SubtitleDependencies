Did you always look like this.
Why does it still look so dark oh you.
Know what there we go well now there's a.
Glare that's annoying see now you guys.
Can see why there's rings in my eyes all.
The time yeah i recently got glasses.
Again i know it's been like seven years.
Since i got lasik apparently lasik.
Doesn't last forever so these things are.
Back i mean not that i used it a lot in.
Videos and a lot see me with glasses.
That is because i used to be very.
Insecure about how i look now i don't.
Really care because i'm home and also.
It's a different time you know the.
Glasses for whatever reason in the past.
Decade have become a lot more cool and i.
Think it's because you know enemies are.
More popular because you know anatomy is.
They always have that really cocky.
Arrogant dude who's like looking at the.
Ground laughing to himself as he pushes.
Up his glasses so that he can look at.
You and say something really smart or.
Cool.
Music.
And i still look pretty nerdy i don't.
Really like how i look low insecure.
Still hey guys hey guys hey guys see.
Obviously i haven't vlogged in a very.
Long time but you know i mean it's like.
Riding a bike you know once i start.
Doing it a little warming up it does all.
Comes flooding right back like i.
Remember bieber fever.
That was a thing less than three okay.
Yeah i kind of forgot how to start a.
Video naturally but i know this is not.
It for real this time.
Hey guys so this is definitely the.
Longest break i've ever taken from not.
Posting videos on this channel in my.
Entire youtube career and i know i'm.
Always apologizing and making excuses to.
You guys for why i'm not posting and.
That does get annoying so this time for.
I'm really not going i'm so sorry guys i.
Really just i've been going through a.
Lot of things over the past years one i.
Don't usually talk about relationship.
Stuff here on youtube but just because i.
Made it public ironically last year i am.
No longer dating anyone i'm not dating.
Mrs. shay anymore i know some of you.
Have already figured it out because of.
You know looking at our other social.
Medias but i never really said anything.
Here on youtube and i felt like since i.
Did announce it publicly i should.
Probably let you guys know that as well.
And don't worry it wasn't like a messy.
Breakup or anything like that it was a.
Very mutual i didn't i wasn't gonna make.
A whole video about it i just thought i.
Should mention it to you guys because.
It's been a while since i updated you on.
Anything and don't get me wrong that's.
Not the sole reason why i took this.
Break i mean it probably contributed to.
It a little bit the real reason why i.
Had to take this break was because i.
Needed to reflect on my own life i mean.
It is 2020 and the thing that i have.
Found was that i don't know how to break.
This to you guys but i'm freakin old man.
I mean i just realized that i am going.
To be 30 freakin 30 and i know if this.
Doesn't make any sense but i never.
Thought i'd actually be 30 years old i.
Mean not at least until i was 50 that's.
Three decades oh two dogs could have.
Lived a full life and died in the same.
Amount of time that i've been around i'm.
A two dog death hero and yet at the same.
Time how many times have i been caught a.
Good.
I think about it kind of a lot i'm like.
I mean well 29 christmases in a row and.
Counting nothing that's a big deal or.
Anything you stop stop taking my glasses.
Your glass is who the hell are you i'm.
You but mature as a 30 year old that's.
Why i'm not insecure about wearing my.
Glasses and comparing myself to some.
Silly little anime cartoons oh okay i.
Guess i have a lot meaner in the future.
I'm not trying to be mean.
I just don't have a lot of time to get.
You to where i'm at right now and why.
Exactly do you think i need your help.
Because i am a manifestation of.
Everything you thought you would be by.
The time you're 30 oh really.
Yes married yep kids two of them youtube.
Here and there but most of my time goes.
Into making actual movies and television.
Shows that is when i'm not enjoying my.
Beautiful toilet room toilet er what a.
Toilet aquarium it's a toilet surrounded.
By a gigantic fish tank on all four.
Sides including the floor and the.
Ceiling so that it feels like you're in.
A warm transparent box in the middle of.
The ocean an ocean so big to the point.
That it almost feels like you're in the.
Aquarium but for the fish i don't.
Remember wanting that by 30 but yes i.
Mean like how do you how do you even get.
In there i think it doesn't matter.
You're not gonna have any of those.
Things by the time you're 30 maybe not.
Ever at the rate that you're maturing.
Well i'm not gonna lie i think i was a.
Lot younger when i thought i would have.
All of this by this age i literally.
Forgot about all those goals that's.
Exactly why i'm here to remind you of.
Everything that you ever wanted in life.
So that maybe you can start making.
Changes and finally just grow up because.
You know it's never too late to start.
Really you think i can make that big of.
A change to my life this fast yes i do.
You really think i can rent a movie or a.
Tv show in the next like three months.
People have done it in less so i could.
Really have the toilet aquarium room.
Thing well that's kind of pushing it.
Timewise but i suppose if your movie.
Makes enough money i guess in terms of.
Marriage i mean we live in vegas i could.
Get married today if i wanted to right.
Technically true but i think we still.
Want to make sure we find the right one.
If i get married today i could start a.
Family like immediately i mean why wait.
Right yes i suppose you could you could.
Start thinking about having no not think.
About it i just need to do it i mean i.
Don't want to be an old dad.
Has no energy to play with their kids so.
I need to have both kids by the age of.
30 i mean it is possible if you choose.
To adopt kids oh i want my own blood.
Kids i want blood kids two of them i was.
Kind of hoping there would be two years.
Apart but i guess we could settle for.
Two months if i have the first one this.
Month had the next one in the next.
Couple months you know that's not.
Possible right i know it'll be difficult.
But if i work really hard and i vote.
Ryan think about what you're saying okay.
You only have about what four months.
Left this kid has been going on so long.
You might have even less than that.
I mean like less than three i don't even.
Know why i bother.
So anyway point i'm trying to make if it.
Isn't already clear i was not and i.
Guess i'm still not prepared to turn 30.
And i guess i'm kind of having a midlife.
Crisis which means not only am i getting.
Old but i am already at my midlife at 29.
Years that means i'm only a little 58.
And and that that is so much more time i.
Don't even know why i'm freaking out 29.
Years that's almost 30 years that's two.
More dogs i can have back-to-back they.
Can live and die i'll still be around.
For almost sorry all this time off as.
You can see thinking about life and.
Death has made me a little well dork all.
Jokes aside i know age is just a number.
It's not the most important thing in the.
World the thing is i'm really starting.
To notice differences in myself now that.
I'm getting older and i didn't realize.
It was happening until i took these few.
Months off to reflect now i know it's.
Already too late for me i've already.
Caught the old.
But for you young whippersnappers out.
There i'm gonna tell you guys about the.
Changes i've been noticing in myself so.
That maybe maybe you guys can catch it.
Before it happens to you before you guys.
Catch the old i was gonna make a.
Coronavirus joke but i just found that.
In bad taste is it our people so.
Sensitive these days i don't know man.
I'm old now i don't i feel like i'm a i.
Just i feel like i have the right to.
Offend people because i'm just that age.
Now where like i just don't know better.
Because i'm old coronavirus too soon.
Okay yeah just cancel me just cancel me.
Already i want to turn off the camera.
Turn off the light again oh man dark.
Comedy early detection is everything and.
One of the first things i started.
Noticing about myself is i've started.
Noticing and catching myself saying.
Things that i've heard all people say my.
Whole life the next level past.
Discovering that you're starting to say.
Things that old people say or the old.
People sounds you start to make and.
These are the real minuscule things you.
Might not have noticed throughout your.
Life i don't know when i started doing.
This but i started doing them as well.
Music.
You know back in my day well okay you.
Know kids these days okay floored is a.
Tic-tac-toe large market what the flog.
Hurry up marking kids these days yeah i.
Don't know what flarg is i don't think.
That's a thing the point i was trying to.
Make is that old people don't like to.
Curse so they replaced curse words with.
Other words i'm just i'm just gonna be.
Honest i just made that word up because.
I didn't want to put anything close to a.
Swear word in here even put the beep.
Sound in because i don't want to get to.
Monetize seriously like youtube doesn't.
Even want you to put those sensor beeps.
Anymore or it could flag it as like.
Age-restricted.
I mean what's next you know i mean i.
Remember back in my day youtube did not.
Care about things like.
Know why i went so there now this next.
One i've always been old in i guess it's.
The kids lingo these days i was always.
Behind when he came to trends even like.
Five years ago i kinda knew memes i kind.
Of knew like what kids were saying these.
Days today i have no idea what the hell.
Kids are talking about when i say kids i.
Mean people that are still in their.
Early 20s because to me i can understand.
Them right that party last night was mac.
Ya know cat dude yeah totally guys it.
Was so well lit at that party everywhere.
Lights on the ceilings and on the sides.
There was like almost no shadows no caps.
Either right.
Just a couple hats like that i don't.
Know caps whatsoever yo was that growing.
Red though are you talking about.
Smashley no her name is not actually.
Smashley.
Right and you mean i usually doesn't.
Gonna nickname no it's it's good that.
Would be ridiculous if her real name was.
Smashley like it is in smash then what.
Does she like a playstation came smash.
Bros ooh but she so bad and obese her.
Body mass index probably twice the.
Normal rate of like an average person at.
That height right yeah oh no cat right.
Another old person thing i have been.
Getting new interests that are not.
Gaming or youtube i've been more.
Interested in politics i have been.
Trying to read more books but probably.
Worst of all i have been kind of into.
Learning about the stock market i'm not.
Gonna lie i'm getting pretty good at it.
Music.
What are you trying to learn about.
Stocks yeah i just can't decide which.
Stock to buy what are you interested in.
Just the broth really the broth you know.
I just can't decide between like chicken.
Or beef wish stock would you buy aren't.
You a little bit old to be making these.
Kinds of corny joe horn stock.
And last but not least and probably the.
Most cliche way to spot someone who's.
Getting old we all know this one it's.
About music everyone grows up with a.
Certain generation of music and for some.
Reason the the generation of music you.
Grow up with will always be the best no.
Matter what and the moment you feel that.
Music quote unquote these days aren't as.
Good as it used to be when you were.
Growing up chances are you've already.
Contracted deal and the thing is once.
You're at this point you don't recover.
From it it only gets worse and worse.
Newer music becomes more and more.
Unlistenable to you and not only do you.
Resort back to the music you grew up.
With but you start having an.
Appreciation for the music from the.
Generation before you and the generation.
Before that and so on even before you.
Know it it happens you're just old and.
The truly truly terrifying part about.
All of this is that you stop caring that.
You're old because really truly old.
People they give zero flogs.
Music.
Music.
Music.
Music.
Yeah no i must not be super old because.
I i still care how bad i look in these.
Here you know these back you really just.
Don't want to grow up huh what are you.
Talking about it just did a whole video.
Showing you how old i'm getting look i'm.
Just gonna be straight up with you.
Because i care.
This whole video is about you worrying.
About getting old but when i look at you.
All i see is a child thank you no it's.
Not a compliment okay look there's.
Nothing wrong with getting old everybody.
Ages alright the only thing that's sad.
About you turning 30 isn't the fact that.
You're acting older that you're changing.
In any way it's the fact that you're not.
You're exactly the same.
There's been no growth from you in years.
And i don't think you've even noticed.
That no i have i mean i know i've been.
Five nine since high school i have grown.
About 15 pounds since then though so.
There's that see this is exactly what.
I'm talking about you can't even go 30.
Seconds without making some kind of.
Stupid joke how do you expect to become.
Me if you're not willing to change look.
No offense but i don't want to become me.
I'm not trying to be you okay i might.
Not be the most mature person in the.
World and i wear the same clothes that.
I've been wearing for the past decade.
And yeah i still think puns are one of.
The funniest things ever created by god.
Is not a god creation got a disagree but.
Like you are everything i thought i.
Wanted to be by age 30 but now that.
You're sitting right in front of me i.
Know now thank you.
Wait dumber than me man but what you're.
What i thought 30 year old me was gonna.
Look like as a kid you're just an idea.
From a kid version of me and i'm way.
Smarter than kid me kidding me this is.
Ridiculous i don't even know what to say.
Roughly because you're dumb no it's.
Because i'm too intelligent to be.
Engaging with someone like you engage me.
I'm just trying to marry you weirdo no.
That's not what i meant just face it man.
You're stupid you're the one who wants.
App not just one but two biological kids.
By the time you're 30 that's it for.
Months that's just not realistic well.
With that attitude i guess look i know.
Exactly what.
Do all right i know that you're not that.
Dumb and i know you're not even in.
Denial you're just trolling because.
That's the only way that you know how to.
Cope with something as important to your.
Life as this and it's not going your way.
Am i right.
That's stupid another dumb thing to come.
Out of your mouth like cut the act.
Already man you're gonna be 30 seriously.
You know damn well that it takes nine.
Months to have a baby and and that's.
Assuming you already have somebody who's.
Willing to have a baby with you which.
You don't so just so you can finally.
Admit to yourself and hear it out loud.
I'm telling you you're not gonna have.
The life you thought you were gonna have.
By age 30 you're not gonna be married.
You're not gonna be done with youtube.
You're not gonna do anything really.
Significant for this world and most.
Importantly you're not gonna be done.
Making those silly awful puns basically.
Dad jokes despite the fact that you're.
Not gonna be a dad by the time you're 30.
Maybe not ever.
It's time to face reality right it's.
Time to grow up.
Music.
Right.
I've wasted so much time i i know i.
Won't be married i know i probably won't.
Be done with you two but i won't do.
Anything significant for the world.
Really doing this it doesn't mean you.
Can't start trying now no i've already.
Accepted that the only thing i can't.
Accept because i know that if i change.
Right now i could have it.
I will have my two kids and by the age.
Of thirty this is literally the only.
Thing you can't do nine months to have a.
Baby you say huh yes you already know.
That well then i guess i'll just have to.
Have twins.
That makes margit dance.
