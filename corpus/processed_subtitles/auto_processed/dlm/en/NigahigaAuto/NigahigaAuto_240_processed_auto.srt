You've seen the videos primitive.
Technology primitive survival and all.
The other primitive building type of.
Videos that have gone viral over the.
Past year usually just one or two guys.
In the middle of the wilderness building.
A house or a pool or a house with a pool.
All kinds of structures from scratch.
Without saying a single word throughout.
The entire experience well on this the.
Very first episode of ryan tries where i.
Try to do things that i probably.
Shouldn't try i'm going to attempt to.
Create a primitive building video of my.
Very own but instead of going to the.
Jungle we're going to the mountains.
Joining me on this challenge would be.
One of my longtime very very good.
Friends gregory and what we're gonna be.
Doing is building an epic gigantic snow.
Fort entirely from scratch what are you.
So we're going on snowboarding trip i.
Sure did gregory but i can assure you we.
Surely are not because what we're gonna.
Be doing instead is from morning tonight.
Every single inch of daylight that we.
Have we're gonna be building and working.
And carrying it sweating until there's.
No time for snowboarding what do you.
Mean like that video we did before why.
Would you want to do anything like that.
Took us all day yes and i know how.
Exhausting it was but let me tell you.
This one is gonna be so much funner.
Because not only are we building this.
For bigger and better than last time but.
We're going primitive which means we.
Have access to no tools we won't have.
Seven other people helping us it'll just.
Be me and you and instead of one long.
Exhausting day of manual labor.
Let's multiply that by three welcome to.
Ryan's rise.
