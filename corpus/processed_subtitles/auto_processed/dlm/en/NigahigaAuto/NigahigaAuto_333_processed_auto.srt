Make thank goodness then what are we.
Gonna do i don't know that's why i'm.
Asking you guys to help me out here man.
What if we did our own version of.
Youtube rewind what yeah actually.
Youtube rewind is just showing all the.
Biggest videos and trends of the year we.
Can do that yeah but with a really high.
Production value and a bunch of.
Youtubers making cameos how are we.
Supposed to do that.
We can't but you know what we can do a.
Really crappy version of it with no.
Cameos from other youtubers just me and.
We'll call it youtube rear ioan ah boom.
I love it i love it i love it didn't you.
Just say that you weren't going to make.
Videos that take a long time stop living.
In the past derek that was 15 seconds.
Ago alright let's talk about the past.
Now if we're gonna do this we have to.
Think about all the biggest trends that.
Happen this year ending with the biggest.
So if we work backwards what was the.
Biggest trend that happened this year i.
Would say adele adele yeah she was one.
Of the biggest things this year.
I don't recall i think he means a dell.
Computer right what no no derek tell.
Computers were not a big thing this year.
I know i'm time adele the singer her.
Album her song hello hi oh her yeah i.
Mean i guess she's up-and-coming but i.
Wouldn't end the whole video with what.
Are you talking about she broke records.
This year over million sales in a week.
27 million views in a day did youtube.
Rewind do something about her no exactly.
Fine what ideas you guys have been what.
About the pizza rap video that was.
Relevant for like a week with a girl.
Throwing the shovel that was even this.
Year hitting the quan know i still think.
Adele's bigger iphone 5 that was like.
Two years ago.
I mean 5s okay i got you hotline bling.
By drake okay that's actually a decent.
Way i told you adele wasn't the biggest.
Thing no i still think adele's album was.
Just as big look even if they were equal.
Who's gonna pick that del over drake.
Well it's either del or drake and.
There's two options there's three of us.
Yeah so let's take a vote fine.
I vote for drake fine i vote it down.
What about planking what planking it was.
Huge everybody did it well he does have.
A point now was five years ago.

Can't vote what are you talking about.
That's not even an option let's just.
Forget the ending for now that just go.
