Hey guys so i know i don't ever say this.
Cuz i don't like to brag or anything but.
I'm probably the most romantic person.
I've ever met.
In the entire world ever if anything i.
Always say in my videos that i'm.
Actually the opposite that i'm not.
Romantic but i really am i'm a womanizer.
Which means i'm a i'm a britney spears.
Song apparently that's crazy.
Oops did it again as i was saying a very.
Romantic person.
I literally do all the things that grows.
Want for example i open doors oh you.
Want me to drive of course not i'm a.
Gentleman.
Get in okay i bring her flowers hey i.
Got something oh.
And are there curtain fire but i.
Remember this time i remembered i got.
Your real ones as well oh.
See how they're like realistic i pulled.
Her chair oh thank you.
How was he and i know nobody even does.
This anymore but i'm such an old-school.
Romantic that i even take her jacket oh.
That is cold here let me get this oh.
Actually i'm kind of cool no it's okay.
Okay that's way better should i get your.
Jacket since you took mine no i'm good.
Moms go should you see shivering is not.
Dead or something like that anyway isn't.
Already incredibly obvious that i am.
Clearly joking i'm horrible when it.
Comes to romance and i honestly believe.
It's because of romantic movies they set.
The bar too high for the rest of us.
Holly what does the same thing every.
Year they take this best-selling.
Romantic novel turn it into a movie all.
The girls in real life go and see this.
Movie fall in love with the main guy.
Who's impossibly perfect and makes it.
Impossible for the rest of us to compete.
And when i thought about it actually.
Gave me the idea that well i should do.
That so i did here's a little trailer.
Representing pretty much every single.
Romantic movie ever made except for the.
Fact that it's not based off of a novel.
And of course again it's not a real.
Movie it's just a trailer and also the.
Main guy is me which is well obviously.
That would never happen because you know.
Bring my eyes.
Hollywood would never cast somebody with.
Eyes like this but you know i have bad.
Eyesight and if you had eyes like this.
You wouldn't be able to read the script.
And also i mean let's just be honest.
Hollywood would never cast somebody with.
My type of race you know with my kind of.
Genes because i mean if there was like a.
Running scene or some.
You know i would never believe these.
Things these jeans are way too big to.
Race in and of course the most obvious.
Reason that hollywood would never cast.
Someone like me is because well i'm.
White with mapping centers pretty much.
Every single romantic movie ever made.
Take a look when an obviously older than.
20 year old high-school boy moves to a.
New town you're gonna love it here.
Sweetie.
Friendships will be made i also broke.
Sas gun i'll bring one printing.
Birthrates up brian hey do you guys know.
What that girl is in there yeah actually.
The hottest girl in school tall blonde.
You don't want to mess with that what do.
You mean she's kind of weird man she.
Doesn't talk to him she just plays with.
Cola.
Until fate and venial ii brought them.
Together welcome to chemistry 101.
I am mr. fate today you'll be pairing up.
For the rest of the semester what why.
Don't you hook up with kady what hook up.
With kady be a partner really get to.
Know each other so that you two can.
Create some chemistry together.
Um just don't start frenching in my.
Class okay you too but no i wasn't.
Planning that says here you do also have.
French class.
Together with mr. wingman oh right oh.
Yeah.
You two should probably keep secrets.
Will be discovered hey so i know you.
Don't talk that much but i was just.
Wondering if maybe we should meet up.
After school to work on our magnet.
Mother was a coal miner but she died in.
A coal mine after caved in and i'm.
Emotionally distraught and the only.
Thing that makes me happiest carving.
Figurines out of coal because it reminds.
Me of her.
Okay um i wasn't really asking you about.
That but you save you're never going to.
Opposites will attract so since my.
Magnet is positive and your negative.
Should be able to attract thank you what.
I like you like like you oh you were.
Talking you're talking about the magnet.
Sorry.
Doors will open.
This is where i may call myself how.
They're actually amazing you could sell.

Cute montage to show how perfect they.
Are together.
With beautiful moving shots of inanimate.
Objects corny lines for teenage girls to.
Quote on facebook love it's like a fart.
It's warm.
Predictable sometimes it stinks but it.
Can also be the best feeling in the.
World that's why i'm so happy i passed.
Through that day i know now i fart you.
It's an insignificant act that will.
Probably make sense at the end of the.
Movie hey can i ask you something kind.
Of random sure do you believe in.
Miracles no i don't think so or not i.
Guess i've just never seen one happened.
