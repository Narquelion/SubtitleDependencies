Hey guys as you can see i'm back home in.
Boy and i was planning to pose a.
Different video today but being the.
Idiot that i am i forgot that video in.
Vegas on a different computer so but.
Anyway every year come back home during.
The holiday season i try to play at.
Least one nice thing for a random stream.
Whether it's paying for someone's meal.
In a restaurant my buddy gets where a.
Homeless person or like punching a.
Crying baby on an airplane in the face.
Because i care about it nah just kidding.
I don't have the homeless or pay for.
Meals so yesterday i thought it'd be fun.
If i dressed up like santa claus and i.
Bought a bunch of toys and flowers and.
Burgers and just gave them all to random.
People just to make their days been.
Except for the minor detail that i.
Didn't have a sata suit so i just want.
An enjoy one instead because i feel it.
With all the negativity happening in the.
World with you know the shootings and.
You know just a bunch of people doing.
Crazy things because they thought the.
World was in there i feel like people.
Are losing faith in humanity and one.
Random act of kindness could change the.
Mind of someone who was planning to kill.
Someone or planning to do something.
Really bad and also i just really wanted.
To wear a ninja suit and walk around.
Town because i thought it'd be fun.
Chickens.
But in all seriousness i didn't post.
This video so you guys can be like oh my.
God he's such a good person i'm really.
Not i punch babies on airplanes remember.
I posted this video with the hopes that.
It would inspire at least a few of you.
To go and commit random acts of kindness.
So again sorry this is not my usual type.
Of video i will post that other video as.
Soon as i get back to vegas but until.
Then from all the people at the ryan.
Eagle production company we hope you.
Have a very happy holidays in a great.
New year and just remember that if.
You're traveling be safe and know that.
God gave babies nostrils for a reason.
Who can screw brood.
