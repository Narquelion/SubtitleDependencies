First there was the board then there was.
The skateboard then there was the.
Skateboard with steering and now for the.
First time ever it's here the cardboard.
The cardboard also known as the cyborg.
Air board rowing device is the future of.
Transportation.
Why walk then you could be not walking.
Step after step after step aren't you.
Sick of it yet and you rather just be on.
Wheels all the time well with the.
Cardboard you'll never not not be on.
Wheels again so what would it cost.
Similar products will cost you an arm.
And a leg but thanks to the cardboards.
Advanced design will cost you any body.
Parts at all just cash and did we.
Mention that the cardboard is completely.
Customizable of course we haven't we're.
Only at that part now the cardboard is.
Completely customized you'll never have.
The same cardboard as someone else with.
Our crazy selection of colors such as.
Brown dark brown faded brown shiny brown.
Tara brown eye brown hot brown cleveland.
Brown and for the really daring you can.
Even get it in red yellow or blue all.
Mixed together to create a nice.
Prominent brown but that's not all.
You'll also be able to customize the.
Safety straps as well not to mention the.
Headlights and taillights too so how.
Does it work now i know what you're.
Thinking the cardboard literally defies.
Gravity so it doesn't really work well.
The answer is simple definitely maybe it.
Might you see gravity is nothing more.
Than a science book and so is the word.
Oxygen also known as o2 to most.
Scientists meaning there's two o's tools.
And tools are what makes things were.
Moving that the cardboard indeed were.
Noisy place the cardboard wouldn't defy.
Gravity is in space because there's no.
Oxygen so how can you get the cardboard.
