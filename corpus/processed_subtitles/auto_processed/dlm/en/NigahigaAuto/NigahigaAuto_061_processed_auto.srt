Hey guys so yesterday was thanksgiving.
And the day before that i went to the.
Market to go buy a turkey because i like.
Market turkeys better than homemade.
Anyway and partially also because i was.
Too lazy to cook i know so i don't know.
How to cook but anyway as i was at the.
Checkout counter checking out my turkey.
Well really no one this time all right.
Doctor she said really she said it so.
You know anyway as i was checking out.
Minding my own business this old lady.
Comes up behind me and feel the need to.
Preach to me and your total is 21 figure.
Oh having a thanksgiving dinner.
Oh yeah it's for tomorrow about you i'm.
Vegan so yeah i just don't really.
Believe in the whole slaughtering.
Animals thing i mean really you should.
Think about it there are a lot of.
Documentaries online that you can watch.
And it is just disgusting i mean what.
Gives a person the right to decide.
Whether it and then that exact moment.
Right then right there that's when i.
Realized this cashier did not even have.
My back he didn't say one word giving is.
Just sick immoral and wrong yeah no i.
Yeah i'm probably still gonna get this.
Turkey so okay so maybe i didn't say.
That last part term but i think vegans.
Are awesome they don't eat anything that.
Has to do with adam which actually saves.
A lot of animals for the rest of us even.
Though i can't stand with you or try to.
Force their beliefs unto other people.
That old vegan lady kind of had a point.
And it's kind of messed up to say out.
Loud but when i think about it i.
Actually don't value an animal's life as.
Much as a human i mean i love my dog but.
If there was a ring that will stop not.
Anymore i mean i love my dog so much but.
If there was a car that's about to hit a.
Person and a dog i probably pushed the.
Person on the way instead but if i did.
That i probably get hit by the car too.
And that would suck i mean i probably.
Just do the logical thing and as the car.
Drives by i jump into the moving cars.
Window force the drivers foot down on.
The brake till it comes to a complete.
Stop grab the cell phone he's texting on.
Halsted outside shifted into reverse run.
The phone over pull up my arsenic inject.
Him in the neck shove the body outside.
Of the car put it back into drive and.
Steer it away from the man and just hit.
The dog so that i could save his life.
And then i'd probably have to run him.
Over as well because he just witnessed.
Me kill a guy and run over a dog just to.
Save his life but the point is i would.
Save the man's life over the dog and.
Then enough to kill him as i was saying.
I always saw myself as like an animal.
But i guess i never realized how little.
Society actually values their lives.
Compared to ours think about if a human.
Kills another human he ends up in jim.
And adam a were to even harm a human it.
Wouldn't go to jail we probably kill in.
Fact most of our pets that we love the.
Most are pretty much already in jail.
Take dogs for example we lock them up so.
They don't run away they only eat when.
We tell them to and if you have two dogs.
I mean they might not be in a shower but.
There's always that one dog that likes.
To hump the other one even people who.
Love animals most like zookeepers think.
About in an animal's perspective they're.
Pretty much just a warning of a big joe.
That profits off of their prisoners so.
Overall i guess what i'm really trying.
To say is i get it now into the video ad.
Standing behind me in the market thank.
You thank you for helping me open my.
Eyes and realize that animals really are.
A lot less important than i thought they.
