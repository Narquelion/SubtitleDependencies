Young girls cuz young girls need.
Somebody to look up to you know somebody.
That's like young and smart and.
Beautiful and smart and intelligent and.
All six of those things put together and.
I'm gonna do just that with my new show.

Called beautiful young smart in.
Television oh yeah my shells caught.
Regina's and shandies hi i'm regina but.
You can call me regina and i'm shawna.

About an asian saying the word laundry.
But it's not we're not racing and we.
Hate laundry wicked regina.
Shaun diez.
So welcome    thank you guys again.
For tuning into our show you guys don't.

That right shaunie's yeah right okay.
Right yeah.
Most of our swaggiest friends live by.
The motto of yo only live once but the.
Cooler and swagger kids live by a.
Completely new model that we made up.
Awesomely never not obeying yolo is not.
Good.
Also known as noe which basically means.
You should awesomely live your life.
Because you only live once because if.
It's honest    and today we're gonna.
Teach you guys how to sound like an.
Annoying team just like us the first.
Step in sounding like an annoying t to.
Fork in your word words are long if.
Something is crazy all you have to say.
Is oh my god that is so crave something.
Is amazing all you have to say is whoa.
That is so amazed and if something is.
Crazy amazing all you have to do is put.
The two together and say oh my god whoa.
That is so creamy the next step in.
Sounding like an annoying teen is simple.
All you have to do is add ears or ease.
To any word it easily becomes annoying.
Boards now pace shanties are you hungers.
Right now so cults hungers how about.
Yeah oh my god i got the rumblies in my.
Tum er you should totally go to chipotle.
Chipotle chipotle is like oh my god i.
Can't even and the last tip we have for.
You to sound like in a knowing teen is.
To make up your own trendy word just.
Like gretchen did in the movie mean.
Girls even at the word fetch it was.
Completely new and completely original.
Most unswayed thing you can do as a teen.
Is to use somebody else's trend words.
Wag oh my god what the.
Make sure you make up your own original.
Word don't copy all you have to do is.
Think of a completely different word.
That relates to the word that you really.
Want to say like if you see a guy who's.
Looking really cool you can say oh my.
God that guy is so cold because cool and.
Colder like twinsies where yeah and if.
He's hot he's hot and he's cold ya know.
Like god just at the katy perry song.
Holt's cape more like cat purrs for sure.
At parrots are like dog bark dogs are so.
Door yeah but barks are never barks or.
Like from tree likes trees have branches.
Branches are likes ted likes dogs and.
Sticks do go together because when you.
Throw a stick like two bags.
Oh my god that's the perfect word he is.
So fast so glad we made it up so thank.

When you guys want to go next.
Yep i'm not trying to rush you but like.
Are you gonna tell us already doing it.
Doing it huh you haven't even said a.
Word well i gotta say it out loud i.
Thought if i just thought about it it.
Would just show up no oh it's a common.
Mistake well my show is basically what.
Everybody comes to the internet to see.
Pranks i mean pranks do well but it's.
Not that original and i did just put out.
A video about prankers going too far.
Exactly that's what makes my pranks.
Different the house see all those.
Prankers that are taking it too far i'm.
Gonna prank them but even farther.
Further further i'm not a reed got you.
So bad man there's a prank.
Who's afraid hello mr. harless rowan.
Yeah this is charles brown who's this.
Hello charlie this is dr. our disa i.
Mean dr. dizzle our junior that the.
Third fourth the 34th yeah your parents.
Were recently in a car accident and you.
Were there emergency contact oh my god.

Parents can't see them yes uh you will.
Be able to see them shortly but i do.
Have to inform you that we don't my.
Dolls can you oh this real quick thank.
You what is this sometimes we use the.
Dollars to explain to kids what really.
Happened so they're not shown i don't.
Need that helmet do it anyway oh um.
Sorry.
Uh look your father we had to amputate.
Both of his arms and well your mother.
Coincidentally we had to amputate both.
Of her legs how happy so we actually.
Thought the best course of action was to.
Take both one arm and one leg from both.
Your mother father and sew them on each.
Other so that they both have at least.
One of each what the only problem is i.
Kinda mixed up the arm in the leg during.
The surgery what what does that even.
Mean well it means that we accidentally.
Sold the same leg on your father and the.
Same arm on your mother so now well this.
Can't be happening it is it did mr.
Pooler there's actually one more thing i.
Need to inform you about could you have.
Possibly done stupid stuff none of this.
Is true bro what my name is art dizzle.
I'm not even a real doctor doesn't even.

Else also everybody else filmed himself.
Playing game but i'm going to film.
Myself watching them play the game i.
Don't like this on attack there's.
Another good idea that's my favorite one.
Yet.
Are you serious flat you actually think.
That's a good show why you always gotta.
Hate on our show ideas we're least we.
Got ideas where's yours hand it back off.
I guess there's no better time than now.
But this is my show idea what i don't.
Get it i still don't have scripts so i.
Don't know what to say for all these.
Years of skits love it's finally time to.
Reveal it feel what well the truth.
That's about it just told them the truth.
I mean i know you told me not to talk.
Back to these voices in my head but i.
Mean what am i gonna do i needed show.
Ideas and they had different ideas i.
Never would have thought of it's like.
They have their own personalities like.
That one that wanted to do a pranking.
Channel that just went way too far and.
Another one that came up with the gaming.
Reacting video which we probably can't.
Even do because we probably get sued for.
That now the girl man i mean i'm not.
Gonna lie she probably had one of the.
Best ideas out of all of them but i got.
A she so annoying i mean sometimes i.
Just want to yeah just i just i don't.
Know how much more i can take you know.
What do you think i should do well first.
Of all just remember when you're feeling.
These feelings just remember what i.
Always say just breathe.
Everything's gonna be okay secondly i.
Think you do have a flow idea i don't.
Think you need those other ideas all.
These voices that you keep hearing.
Inside your head.
I mean if themed queen - that fam really.
You're just gonna cut me off i'm just.
Saying hi to them.
Hi dad oh hi regina it's been a while hi.

Fitting right next to you how to take.
Your life to life wait this doesn't make.
Any sense how are you guys in a second.

Life and death and you must choose your.
Own path what do you mean you have a.
Choice you can choose to come with me.
Right now and enter the gates of heaven.

I don't like this holiday so thank you.
Again so much for watching if you want.
To see bloopers you kinda seems to come.
On the left you want to see the previous.
Skits of video click them on the right.
And remember if you do click them on the.
Right it's you're gonna need like 30.
Minutes because it's a long video but it.
Does explain a lot of things in this.
