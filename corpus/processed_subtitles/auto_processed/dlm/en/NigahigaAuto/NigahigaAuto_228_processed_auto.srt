Hey guys i'm sorry i just a little.
Thrown off today i don't know if you.
Guys know or not but i wasn't.
It's so stupid i was nominated for this.
Creator of the decade award that's going.
On right now i don't know if you guys.
Even know what that is.
I don't even care at all it's the first.
Time i heard of the sharding awards what.
I don't even know what that is like i.
Mean like the label would like creator.
Of the decade is kind of a big deal you.
Know it's not just one year it's a whole.
Decay like five times as many years.
Normally i just little thrown off you.
Know like kind of question to myself.
Like whatever i've been doing all these.
Ten years then and like am i even.
Blogging right right now don't care for.
The record guys i don't care like i.
Don't care.
Seriously i told i don't just didn't.
Rough you know just being like just been.
Other stuff.
Music.
Music.
Music.
Music.
Music.
Music.
Music.
Music.
At least always never gonna win one.
Was it even nominated talking about.
Nominated for what a shorty award.
Creator of the decade you know i always.
Thought that if you worked hard enough.
You really put your heart no matter what.
I mean this huh how did you oh you got.
This when you want it five years ago uh.
I did yeah and that's that's a shorty.
Yes it is so can we please get ready now.
Wait wait get ready for what the.
Streamys the real award show right the.
Streamys yeah that's that that's the one.
That really matters what was i nominated.
Nope and that's why i don't even feel.
Like doing this vlog right now cuz that.
Cutaway was so damn long and boring it.
Sucked all the energy out of me really.
Don't know when to stop this is going on.
Way too long hey guys so if it isn't.
Obvious you know i was being sarcastic.
Just a little bit i really do not care.
About winning some shorty award no fans.
To show you a word i'm not sure i like.
Don't shade or anything i'm just that's.
Not one of the reasons why i do youtube.
And don't get me wrong i actually really.
Appreciate that a lot of you guys didn't.
Care that i didn't nominated for this.
Award it was actually a lot of you.
Whatever really angry about its knowing.
How bad you guys wanted me to win this.
Award already is that's more valuable.
Than the award so i mean i'm not gonna.
Lie i'm still human like it's always.
Nice to give win oh award or be.
Recognized for something you know it's.
Human nature but after a certain point.
Of you know winning these awards or.
Being nominated are going to the award.
Shows themselves you kind of get to a.
Point where you're kind of ah it's gonna.
Sound that don't that you don't.
Appreciate it anymore it's just that you.
Get to a point where you kind of realize.
Like all these awards and award shows.
Are pretty pointless and i'll rather bet.
I just have to go and say that i wanted.
To make this video a long time ago years.
But i never did for two main reasons.
Reason number one i did not want to.
Appear bitter i was actually waiting for.
The opportunity where i would win one of.
These awards so i could make this video.
And not seem like i'm being bidders.
Right now i'm probably coming across as.
Somebody who's just being a bitter sore.
Loser not the reason guys i don't care.
That i didn't win no but seriously i was.
Gonna wait until i want an award to do.
This video but in the form of a speech.
This is gonna be pretty much my award.
Speech good thing i did.
It wouldn't have been smart to do you'll.
See why second reason i never made this.
Video up until now is because let's be.
Real there's a lot of powerful people.
And politics that goes you know behind.
The scenes when it comes to.
Entertainment these particle people they.
They create and run these award shows.
And the reason why i'm finally speaking.
Up right now is because i think i'm.
Finally in a place in my career where i.
Don't really care that much not that i.
Don't care about my career but i don't.
Care as much it's been a process over.
Like two three years where i i decided.
I'm not gonna go through the bs just to.
Make my career but luckily i don't know.
How a lot of you guys have still stuck.
Around which that's why i'm so.
Appreciative that you guys still watch.
And then you guys still want me to win.
These random awards i'm just finally.
Comfortable enough to a place where i.
Feel like i can speak my mind and not.
Worry about the consequences and i think.
It kind of shows in the videos i've been.
Making recently like the recent rear.
Ioan video or like the how to get views.
On youtube they're very critical on.
Youtube and that's not something i.
Normally would have spoke out on because.
It's so controversial and i think a lot.
Of you guys who've been around with me.
Long you don't know that i'm not the.
Kind of person to go out and start.
Controversy or be a part of any drama.
But i'm just calling it as i see it you.
Know i'm just speaking my mind whereas.
Oprah would say speaking my truth i.
Don't know if that's correct i saw.
Someone caught it on facebook i don't.
Watch those stupid awards just these.
Things like that they get me into.
Trouble anyway back to the topic right.
After these messages i think i said it a.
Few times already but i personally.
Believe that you know these awards these.
Award shows are kind of part of this.
Like for won these award shows that you.
Know we all watch i don't want to say.
That they're fake it's super misleading.
And i started finally going to these.
When i was like 10 years ago back in.
High school i was shocked at what these.
Shows really are like during the scene.
This award shows were honest i think.
People would not care about them nearly.
As much they'd just be like this is just.
For promotion again i'm facing a lot.
It's off my own personal experiences it.
Might not be the same for other people.
Also heard a lot of things from friends.
Who told me their stories as well so i.
Think it's a pretty commonly known thing.
In our industry but the public doesn't.
Ever get to see not even talking about.
The award shows themselves the real.
Important things happen even before the.
Award show happens it's easier if i just.
Show you guys let me just show you some.
Of the things that happens behind the.
Scenes of these award shows and you can.
Decide you know.
Your hand makeup should be there on to.
Third in your wardrobe we'll be there.
Shortly after noon well i'm pretty much.
Ready all right oh they helped you.
Already know i just did it myself okay.
30 okay uh how.
About your date does she have her own.
People oh yeah i forgot to tell you g.
Actually can't make it tonight.
Wait what yeah her grandma got sick so.
She's not gonna be able to make it why.
Didn't you say something earlier do you.
At least have a backup no i just figured.
I'd go by myself no you're not a loser.
You know i'll figure it out i'm driving.
Meet me a block away from the venue all.
Right and jackie sorry so yeah we have.
Picked up the person of interest we're.
Gonna be your on the way and oh sorry.
Ryan this is no your name's hennessy.
Yeah hennessy she's gonna be your date.
Tonight what we we just met yeah so do.

Even legal ryan she's not a prostitute.
She's just here to hang out with you.
Rich people do this all the time to look.
Cooler we're here all right well thank.
You no no no look.
Cars not big enough uh what time is it.
Let's circle the block again sir what.
Why look there's not enough people you.
Show up too early you look like a loser.
You show up too late all the real.
Celebrities get the attention you gotta.
Find the sweet spot so we just drive.
Around in circles yep this looks doable.
Wait let them do it.
All right here's the plan.
You're just gonna stay here and look.
Good you're gonna go talk to some fans.
And sign autographs and when i come up.
To you just say just give me a minute.
Why would i have to just do it fine ryan.
We have to go but you just told me to.
Come over there inside i have oh just.
Give me a minute.
Oh fine hey so how's the event go and.
It's pretty good right where's the.
Patrice hennessy is gonna be waiting at.
The end of the interviews which i lined.
Up for us so what do you want to start.
With oh we know people we matt jacob.
Really all right new plan so what you're.
Gonna do is you're gonna go over there.
You just say hi you're gonna have a.
Couple laughs and then we're gonna move.
On that's it i don't even know the guy.
He's 22 years old 12 inch sub has a.
Younger sister good luck.
It's so good to see you again nice hey.
How do you like be from hawaii.
How do it what collab yeah okay sure.
Check it your email or okay so maybe.
These things didn't exactly happen that.
Way but i'm just trying to show you an.
Idea and to be honest it's not that far.
Wrong and i'm just speaking from my.
Point of view of things i've witnessed.
Other creators who's been around the.
Block long you know if they might not.
Say it publicly but they know what i'm.
Talking about they know the game oh they.
Know z that's them meeting me up about.
The game because sorry guys i put some.
Sorry and i know it might seem strange.
From the outside.
Like why would people do these things.
Through this it works this is the bs i.
Was talking about that i don't like.
Doing but to be honest if i really.
Wanted to help my career and if you're.
An entertainment you want to help your.
Career you should be doing these things.
That's why so many creators and actors.
Who hate doing these things still do it.
Because they have to and it's not.
Anyone's fault they have to do it to.
Stay relevant again i have nothing.
Against these award shows i think it's.
Great entertainment but that's it where.
I have an issue with this is that we as.
A society value these awards so much.
More than just entertainment some of.
These awards we treat it like it's an.
Integral part of our society take the.
Oscars for example remember the whole.
Hashtag oscarssowhite.
Controversy remember that we're a bunch.
Of people even other actors and.
Celebrities were saying like you know.
The oscars are racist because there's so.
Many white people winning and not enough.
You know people other misses and being a.
Minority being asian myself i always.
Thought you know i completely get why.
People are upset but i always thought.
Like this happens every year nothing.
Gets changed you know there's what's the.
Solution and when i really thought about.
It my point of view was always if you.
Really think the oscars are racist then.
Why are you watching them why are you.
Supporting it there are all these.
Celebrities that are speaking out.
Against the oscars seeing the asean.
Racist ills showing up to the oscars.
Hoping to win one you guys want to.
Change then make that change and stop.
Doing this silly piece of metal more.
Value than it really deserve we are the.
Reason the oscars are valium we don't.
Need the officers or any award show to.
Tell us what's good and what isn't we.
Can decide that for ourselves by caring.
So much about these awards we're just.
Giving them more power for example all.
The people who are leonardo dicaprio.
Fans and we're so upset that he'd never.
Won in austin does why without an oscar.
Leonardo dicaprio is not a great actor.
He's not one of the best just because he.
Has an oscar now we're suddenly like.
Okay now he's one of the best doesn't.
Make any sense it's like letting a whole.
Group of other people decide all our.
Opinions for us is if we can't do that.
Ourselves i'm sorry getting mad i don't.
Know why we are taught the known oscar.
Is this incredibly valuable prestigious.
Award and i know a lot of people are.
Gonna say oh yeah it is valuable.
Prestigious because just like having one.
You make millions more as an actor well.
Again yes that's because we were taught.
That it is worth this money in the grand.
Scheme of things that if you really.
Break it down is this little trophy.
Really that great if the oscars were.
Invented today and you know all the same.
Actors all the same movies were all.
Nominated nobody would care who won the.
Celebrities probably wouldn't even show.
Up if you gave a little kid who has no.
Knowledge of the oscars a choice between.
A oscar statue or a pigeon spinner.
Chances are you applied to this.
Without being taught how valuable an.
Award is it's meaningless even by.
Complaining about it so much you're.
Showing how much it matters how much you.
Care you're just giving more power to.
The award that's your fault anything is.
The people in charge of these awards.
Just become more powerful you might not.
Think it affects you but it does because.
If you control something that.
Celebrities want you have control over a.
Lot of kievan all that power goes all.
The way back to the top right now.
Believe it or not the same thing is.
Happening with these internet award and.
Then because i was there to see it for.
The very beginning it's just so clear.
And brilliant actually how it happened i.
Didn't make something value you can't.
Make something valuable without people.
Paying attention how do you get people's.
Attention celebrities do you get.
Celebrities to be a part of it there he.
Goes tell them you want to give them.
Something to show them how great they.
Are once you get a few big celebs there.
Then all the other smaller ones join in.
Too because they want to be a part of.
Whatever these bigger celebrities are.
Doing once all of the celebrities care.
About it so do all their fans and i'm.
Sure you can see where i'm going with.
This it just keeps spreading let's be.
Real you know celebrities come together.
And collectively say something about.
Anything it becomes a fad that's just.
How our society works because nobody.
Thinks for themselves including myself.
We like to be told what to think we just.
Accept what we're being taught oh i'm.
Sorry guys i haven't made a ran video.
Like this in a long time probably set up.
A bunch of stuff i shouldn't be saying.
Publicly but you know whoops.
Overall what i'm really trying to say is.
Whether it's a shorty award a streamy.
Award an oscar even is not an award and.
All just think for yourself don't just.
Believe everything you're being done.
Including everything i'm saying to you.
Right now as always that's why that's.
The motto out of the vine again this is.
Just my opinion and probably a very.
Unpopular one i'm just trying to give a.
Different point of view it doesn't mean.
It's right it says for you guys to.
Decide i go for this video wasn't just.
To change your mind about award shows it.
Was at the very least just to get people.
To think for themselves that's the real.
Thing i wanted to say before you just.
Believe what you're being taught think.
Twice about i was really getting into it.
At that time see and i swear my silence.
Did but i'm not even texting this person.
Back and they keep.
As i was saying you know my goal was to.
Get people to think for themselves and.
But you know the thing is sometimes.
Celebrities are popular for a reason you.
Know like there's still some validity to.
What to what's behind you know someone's.
Popularity so first sometimes maybe you.
Should just listen to just maybe.
Sometimes.
Music.
