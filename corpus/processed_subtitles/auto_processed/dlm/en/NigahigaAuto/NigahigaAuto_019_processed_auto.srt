Hey guys so i play basketball at a.
Public park a lot and i was kind of.
Inspired to make this video and there's.
Not just ages at this part there's every.
Ethnicity that goes there black white.
Indian hispanic pretty much every single.
Race you can think of have you've ever.
Been to a public basketball park you.
Know exactly what i'm talking about when.
I say there's a lot of racist jokes that.
Goes on there and for some reason most.
Of them are targeted towards the asian.
For example when we're picking teams.
They'll point at me and say give me.
Jeremy lin over there and obviously i.
Don't look like him it's just the fact.
That i'm playing basketball and i'm.
Asian and there's two ways that i could.
Easily take that i could add their act.
Really offended and say damn bro that's.
Racist or i could just make a joke out.
Of it and make it seem like it's not a.
Big deal which is what i usually do and.
It works or another example i would have.
Passed the bond got stolen out wouldn't.
Be surprised if one of my teammates said.
Hey come on you gotta open your eyes bro.
Because asians have small eyes right or.
Even if they were to pass the ball and.
Got stolen by another asian on the other.
Team they would say something like oh my.
Bad i thought you were the jeremy lin on.
My team what you agents look alike.
Because we all look exactly the same.
Right or even sometimes when they ask me.
The score so jeremy lin what's the score.
And i'd be like she's not sure but i.
Thought all you asians were supposed to.
Be good at math well no but actually i.
Think the score is seven 200 or what.
Nothing that's the score oh oh to seven.
Well you mean it so to seven no no it's.
All to seven two o's what.
Double-oh-seven sad part is i actually.
Said that joke at the park once and the.
Reaction is probably the same as you.
Guys you know nobody nobody laughed.
Anyway this is probably another.
Unpopular opinion that i should keep to.
Myself but i'm not going to i'm just.
Gonna be completely honest with you guys.
I personally do not get offended by.
Asian stereotypes anymore because if you.
Really think about it stereotypes not.
Just ages stereotypes but all.
Stereotypes from other ethnicities are.
Somewhat based off of true and rather.
Than getting offended by them and trying.
To deny it i think it's a lot better if.
You were to accept the stereotype so.
That we can break through them instead.
Now before all my fellow asian people.
Attacked me for this opinion just think.
About it i know that most asian.
Stereotypes aren't hugely.
Over-exaggerated and they definitely.
Don't apply to everyone but in general.
Stereotypes come from some truth and.
That's why they should be offensive to.
You like for example when i say asian.
Stereotypes i know one of the first.
Things that come to mind when you look.
At me is that oh he's asian and we all.
Know the stereotype for asians is that.
He has a little well sony or yamaha or.
Some other kind of type of asian stereo.
And you're absolutely right i have a.
Little sony stereo right.
My point is some of my fellow agents out.
There i used to be one of those people.
That got insulted by asian stereotypes.
And i used to deny that they weren't.
True but the thing is that's never gonna.
Work.
Asian stereotypes aren't going anywhere.
Because they are based off of true.
Rather than being offending and trying.
To deny stereotypes i say just own it.
And poopy belong don't give them the.
Satisfaction of being insulted for.
Example one of the most common asian.
Stereotypes is that all asians have.
Squinty eyes obviously it's an.
Exaggeration and it doesn't apply to.
Every asian but statistically it's true.
Agents have smaller eyes it's not even.
An insult to me in fact it's better to.
Have small eyes we can get away with.
Falling asleep in class and if a.
Professor or teacher were to tell us to.
Wake up and open our eyes we can say.
Well that's kind of racist sir okay that.
Was kind of an insult but i'm asian so i.
Can another common asian stereotype is.
That all asians are good at math now i.
Don't even know why asian people get.
Offended by this one it's a compliment.
And again i know the stereotype doesn't.
Apply to everyone i mean i can name five.
Asians off the top of my head that.
Aren't good at math sean and greg derek.
Me but for the most part it's true.
Cystic aliy most asians around the world.
Are good at math i think you guys pretty.
Much get the point but i'm gonna name a.
Few more asians have poor english yeah a.
Lot of asians - but for those people.
It's because english is their second.
Language in english for their first.
Language they would sound just like me.
And i'm good are their foes not asian.
People my english is that is all asians.
Are bad in sports so all asians are bad.
If sports try saying that the jeremy lin.
He's so good at dota you don't even know.
Asians only eat rice okay this one is a.
Little racist because it's not true at.
All we also eat the noodle all asians.
Know martial arts no not all asians know.
Martial arts but most martial arts are.
From asia even if that's not true for.
Everyone why wouldn't you want people to.
Know that that's cool.
Kung fu kata take kendo judo aikido i.
Can understand why that's a stereotype.
Asians have bad teeth okay this one is.
An insult because teeth are supposedly.
Beauty and basically you're saying in.
Asians are bad teeth they're not.
Beautiful i mean but let's be real for a.
Second you can't really get offended by.
This about 50% of all the asian kids i.
Knew had braces the other half were.
Either really lucky or they still do.
Need braces again don't get offended by.
It just own it yeah i got messed-up.
Teeth but i can get braces what you.
Gonna do about your face okay you don't.
Want to say that but that was just an.
Example all asians are chinese know just.
Because somebody's asian it doesn't mean.
They're chinese that's like assuming all.
White people are irish or german or some.
Other type of white and just for the.
Record because i know this is gonna come.
Up in the comments i'm japanese which is.
Completely different from chinese like.
Jeremy lin he's trying.
Do i look anything like that no i'm way.
Buffer than he is that's another.
Stereotype asians aren't both look at.
This huh you see that mountain right.
There you see these guns you can't make.
Fun of you who make fun of yourself i.
Made a joke about it earlier but one of.
The most common stereotypes that people.
Use as an insult is that asians have.
Small well wieners at least for me i'm.
Not afraid to admit it i got a mini.
Wiener right here his name is marley and.
He's my miniature wiener dog who's.
Actually been sitting on my lap this.
Whole time right next to my little.
Sausage i believe they're called smokies.
Not sure why they're called that.
Probably cuz they're so small and you.
Have to hold it like a cigarette not.
That i would know how to hold a.
Cigarette i don't smoke but that is how.
I hold my little penis penis isn't dick.
You know my little dick dick isn't.
Richard richard is in richard marks one.
Of my favorite pianists of all time he's.
Such an inspiration i always keep a.
Picture of him right in my left pocket.
Next to my vagina and last but not least.
Regions can't drive this is one of the.
Few stereotypes that i have no idea.
Where they came from it's not.
Statistically true personally i'm not a.
Bad driver i only got into like three.
Accidents so far and got pulled over.
Maybe like three or four times for.
Speeding and running a red light stop.
Signs you know the common things that.
Everybody gets oh and of course the.
Really common driving mistake that.
Everyone does you know when you put your.
Armor on the passenger seat to help you.
Look back cuz you're gonna reverse and.
Then when you press the gas you realize.
You're still in drive so you have.
Forward so again i don't know where that.
Stereotype comes from because it happens.
To everybody because even in basketball.
Attorney asians are great at drive the.
Best you know i've been making fun of.
Him this entire video but jeremy lin is.
An excellent driver i mean all he does.
Is drive cuz we all know he is.
Definitely not a shooter oh jeremy hey i.
Didn't know you were in here you don't.
Think i can shoot what no i did pretty.
Sure you just said i can't shoot there.
Was no obvious joke they give me the.
Ball where did that come from who passed.
Me if i wasn't a shooter could i do this.
Music.
Music.
Even after all that you still can't make.
A single i can't shoot so thank you guys.
Again so much for watching if you want.
To see bloopers and behind the scenes.
Click the one the left if you want to.
See the previous video click the one on.
The right and once again thank you so.
Much to jeremy lin for being in this.
Video and also for breaking down the.
Stereotype that asians can play.
Basketball i mean i i can't play.
Basketball i mean i can i'm just not.
That good well yeah at least jeremy's.
Good in dota and basketball i'm not that.
Good at dota either.
