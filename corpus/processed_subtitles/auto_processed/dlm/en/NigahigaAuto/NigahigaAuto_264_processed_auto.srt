With people who will try to inspire.
Others i think that's great that's one.
Of the many reasons why i still do.

There i'm not looking right now oh okay.
Then she's just don't get in man every.
Day like it's your last.
This is the worst thing you can preach.
To kids and i heard this as a kid.
Growing up all the time is just so.
Irresponsible the reason why people take.
Care of themselves and they behave and.
They fall in love is is for their future.
It's not for that day.
What's on that dude what the hell.
Happened well with referred to all of.
This yesterday i was on my way to spend.
All my life savings at the mall and when.
I got there other than just parking in.
The hot side i just grabbed my cards at.
The front doors ran over a few people.
Went that's when the cops showed up and.
Get this i recognized one without one.
Faster than give me a piggy come one.
Wants to go so i've swapped up to him.
And just punched him in the face got.
Tackled ed no what are you crazy you.
Just ruined your life dinner it's fine.
Because yes here was my last day and so.
As today you know i'm just going to a.
Drop of soap i don't even care of scared.
I love what you do do what you love how.
Profound oh a brilliant.
It's literally saying the same thing.
Twice the only way that this quote is.
Remotely useful isn't that the transit.
Property you can also say eat what makes.
You full be full from what you eat enjoy.
Where you live live where you enjoy.
Living one plus two equals three three.
Equals two plus one.
Hashtag transitive property always look.
On the bright side this one's not that.
Stupid it's just they shouldn't have put.
The word always in they can't always.
Look on the bright side i mean you can.
But that's delusion something it's fun.
On my girls pregnant why are we gonna do.
Like it's gonna ruin us hey come on.
Don't think like that i mean i love her.
And i think she's the one but i still.
Think we're ready to be parents yet hey.
Look on the bright side you're right do.
The get you don't even know if it's.
Yours yet i think she did kiss a lot of.
Frogs before you you know looks money.
Doesn't buy happiness last but not least.
This one is actually one of my favorite.
And the perfect example to use because.
It's the one that everybody usually.
Agrees with everybody grew up with this.
This quote being told to them we know.
One way or another whether it's.
Literally a teacher or parents saying.
That to you or an inspirational video or.
You saw the lesson on some disney show.
Or the show's horns everybody else money.
Is the root of all evil and although.
Again i agree with this one to a certain.
Degree i know it sounds bad but does it.
Make you that bad of a person to be.
Realistic for a change what's wrong just.
Found out my prom is dead what what you.
Saw yesterday she passed away last night.
No she's still alive but she's in the.
Hospital right now she requires a very.
Very expensive surgery and i can't.
Afford it can barely afford rent let.
Alone the food on the table you know.
What have you took out a loan or.
Something we're already paying off a.
Bunch of loans i guy i don't know what.
To do all my life is over her life is.
Over.
Maybe not what you're not gonna believe.
This but i magically found this at the.
End of a rainbow and it's filled with.
One and i really feel like you needed a.
Lot more than me there.
Are you serious take it i'm sure it's.
Enough to like pay for the surgery food.
For a year rent your loans whatever.
You're serious you're going to give this.
Yeah like whatever will make you happy.
Man wow.
I don't know what to say other than what.
The hell is your problem.
What how is this supposed to make me.
Happier okay money does not buy.
Happiness no that's supposed to be for.
Your grandma's build it just told you.
How horrible my life is right now and.
You're going to go bring me this the.
Root of all evil no yeah like i said i'm.
A horrible person couldn't get that by.
Now anyway obviously i exaggerated these.
Examples a little bit you know for the.
Video my point remains the same.
Hopefully you picked up on it's great to.
Be inspired every once in a while we all.
Need that you can't live by these cheesy.
Quotes that sound perfect or expect to.
Follow them all the time and maybe i.
Could be wrong maybe there are people.
That actually do live by them all the.
Time but i personally think that if you.
Really think you're living your life.
Perfectly you're lying to yourself.
Because as nice as these things might.
Sound nobody can live perfectly and.
Everybody goes through highs and low you.
Just have to be realistic it's fine if.
You don't live every single day like.
It's your last or to the fullest because.
You're not wasting your time sometimes.
People like to chill my last day would.
Still be probably staying at home.
Watching netflix and it might be a waste.
Of time but i enjoy it and no money does.
Not buy true happiness but must be.
Realistic here and i'll use this one as.
The example cuz it's the last one that.
You seen and it's you know that you just.
Understand i actually find the realistic.
Quotes you know in response the cheesy.
Ones to be more inspiring there's that.
Realistic name that says you know money.
Does not buy happiness but i'd rather be.
Crying in a ferrari with a million.
Dollar home rather than living on the.
Street yeah it doesn't sound nice or.
Inspirational but at least it's true and.
To be honest that actually inspired me.
More because it makes me appreciate what.
I'm fortunate enough to have if you.
Actually have money and you live by the.
Others saying money does not buy.
Happiness you're taking for granted what.
You're fortunate enough to have like.
Something that would actually bring a.
Lot of happiness to other people who.
Really need it right now and i know this.
All might sound horrible and the.
Opposite of what you want to say is.
Trying to inspire someone but you know.
I'm not trying to sound like a douche or.
A dick i'm just being realistic i'm.
Being real this dick sorry i really i'm.
Starting to sound a dick but you know.
What no i think i'm just being honest in.
Fact i am going to be the inspiring one.
Right now but in the honest way i've.
Been thinking for a while on that in.
Order to be truly happy you do have to.
Be a zig.
Got upset other people's i know from.
Personal experience that if you're.
Always trying to please others that.
Defeats the whole purpose of life this.
Is your life.
So not just okay to be a dick and be a.
Little selfish in fact some of the.
Happiest people or dick repotting.
There's literally the best cake i've.
Ever had seriously that was awesome.
There's one last slice left slope and.
You guys go ahead no no no i already had.
A place where should a minute to the.
Birthday i mean i had the biggest slice.
I could impossible ticket we all move up.
This wears off good we've got four.
Flights you get the point to see.
Sometimes you got to be a dick that.
Could be the start of my realistic.
Inspirational quote line thing right.
Next to the money can buy you happiness.
Mean in fact those two can go together.
Money can't buy you happiness money is.
Happiness because if you have money.
Money makes you rich and rich a sharp.
For richard and as we all know the.
Nickname for richard is dick proving.
That in order to have happiness.
Sometimes you got to be a dick and piss.
People off because like i always quote.
Starting today they can't have happiness.
Without the penis hey okay okay i know i.
Already have to add this party into all.
The people that i might have offended by.
Saying the word dick or penis too much.
At the end there and also now let me.
Just go ahead and make things right and.
Just say vagina yeah gender equality.
