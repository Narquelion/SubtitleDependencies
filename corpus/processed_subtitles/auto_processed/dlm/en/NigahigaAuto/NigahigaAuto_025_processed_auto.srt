These videos before but last year we.
Kind of did one for psych for my higatv.
Channel my second channel i just want to.
Do something to just close the year i'm.
In a while you guys know at the end of.
The year i always try and make you know.
At least one really big video and it.
Always like it ties up all my time and i.
Always want to make this video but i.
Never get the chance to while i have the.
Chance and i have a spare moment today.

Want to talk to you guys directly and.
Say uh thank you guys so much can.
Honestly say 2015 was a great year a lot.
Of you guys already know but like a.
Couple years ago i was i was going.
Through a really rough stretch and doing.
This for like eight years nine years now.
And i was you know eventually it gets to.
You coming up with a new thing every.
Single week is not eating i was.
Literally going crazy for a little bit.
You know i was worried about saying.
Things that would offend people is.
Worried about doing too many blogs like.
This because more people want the skits.
And when i do too many skits more people.
Want the vlogs like i was just stressing.
Myself out way too much worried about.
What everybody else wanted except for.
Myself but this year from the beginning.
Of the year i just decided that i'm.
Gonna let go of all of it i just went.
Back to my roots and created videos that.
I wanted to create videos that nobody.
Liked i made videos that were offensive.
To be my main videos that you know we're.
30 minutes long that is probably the.
Stupidest decision you could ever make.
On youtube because for one who's gonna.
Sit through that but even doing all of.
That stuff you know even doing every.
Single thing i wanted to do posting.
Controversial videos of 30 minute video.
The best thing about this year is that.
You guys are still here.
