Hey guys so this video is something that.
I never thought i would actually do.
Clickbait i'm not quitting youtube well.
I didn't actually say that i was gonna.
Quit but you know having the words quit.
And youtube in the title it kind of you.
Know it's kind of quick beat but it's.
Not i promise and at the same time it's.
Still not completely untrue let me.
Explain the truth is guys over the past.
Year or so i am i sorry it's just um.
It's just really hard for me to gather.
My thoughts when there's loud cheesy.
Emotional music just playing right in my.
Ear as it was saying i already told you.
Guys i'm not quitting but there are.
Gonna be a lot of changes and let me.
Just let me just start for the top so.
That i can explain over the past year i.
Really have been considering quitting.
Youtube see this is why i can't have a.
Serious heart-to-heart talk with you.
Guys because i keep cutting away from.
Random things it's my own fault and him.
Trying to make this all sad it's not.
Saying look guys all jokes aside let me.
Just be real for a sec it's not that i.
Don't want to do youtube and i trust me.
I do realize how great of an opportunity.
It has been for me and and still is but.
I just wasn't having fun making youtube.
Videos anymore and i know it's a.
First-world problem okay i'm not having.
Fun in my job i'm not everybody's.
Supposed to have fun at their job but in.
Order to create really good content and.
Unique things you have to have fun doing.
It at least that's what i believe in not.
A machine like other youtubers i need.
Inspiration i mean that's one of the.
Reasons why i hardly posted last year.
And it took me pretty much the entire.
Year to realize why i found myself.
Falling into the typical youtuber trap.
Of trying to create videos that work.
Versus trying to create videos that well.
You're inspired to make things that you.
Want to even if that means creating.
Videos that i know for a fact that a lot.
Of you guys probably not like or.
Understand are most likely be offensive.
The kind of videos i used to make when i.
First started to you know when i wasn't.
Afraid of disappointing people or being.
Too offensive or getting less views or.
Whatever i just finally realized at the.
In the last year that i was forcing.
Myself to create videos that i don't.
Even feel like me.
And i was holding back so many different.
Things that i really wanted to make i.
Just was too afraid to do it by the way.
I'm not talking about all the videos.
Last year in fact towards the end of.
Last year i started posting some of the.
Videos that i wanted to post n i felt.
The consequences i mean i saw the views.
Drop the dislikes go up but honestly i.
Feel better because i it's something.
I've been wanting to say i'm sure you.
Can figure out which videos i'm talking.
About but anyway once i made the.
Realization that i wasn't having fun.
Anymore.
Towards the end of last year i knew that.
I had to do something about it and make.
A decision either i need to just do.
Something else and quit youtube entirely.
Or i need to make changes and make.
Youtube fun for me again and just start.
Posting you know whatever the hell i.
Want to post and do the shows that i.
Want to do despite all the negative.
Consequences that come with it the.
Dislikes and the bad comments and you.
Know you losing subs whatever it is just.
I just have to do those things because.
That's the whole reason why i started.
Youtube in the first place all i had to.
Do was stop caring stop caring about the.
Things that don't matter stop being.
Afraid of failure and take chances and.
Try new things things that i would have.
Never done you know in the previous.
Years but if that's what it takes to.
Allow me to continue to do this and and.
Have fun doing it then then i'm just.
Gonna do it that's what i decided until.
I realize just how much easier it would.
Be to just quit youtube entirely and.
Just do something else so i went with.
That so over the holidays i really.
Thought about if i were to quit youtube.
I can't just do nothing i had to think.
What else could i possibly do and.
Obviously my first instinct was to do.
Something similar to what i already do.
Entertainment i always wanted to be an.
Actor and right now specifically for.
Asians it's a great time to be an actor.
The whole asian movie going on you know.
Spring diversity and one now asian.
Actors are kind of a hot commodity right.
Now trust me i know what hollywood's.
Looking for hi i'm ryan higa and i'm.
Here to the audition for the role of.
Glenn okay whenever you're ready.
Music.
I need you to promise me that if i don't.
Come back for the pharmacy i need you to.
Be strong live on and do we put a little.
More because i just give you what are.
You doing acting yeah and i'm sorry what.
Kind of accent what are you doing i.
Didn't like the race not sure if you.
Know that knows what glen is an asian.
American character who was born and.
Raised in georgia i'm so sorry i just.
Assumed because this is hollywood and i.
Saw asian written the character.
Elizabeth that's okay.
What does take from the top again okay.
Remember that he's born and raised in.
Georgia georgia got it okay.
I am from georgia and i need i think.
We're what no no no please i i can do.
Better.
Just give me notes or anything to find.
One more time on the top and just lose.
The accent but the character it says he.
Has a slight accent a southern one.
Because he's born and raised in georgia.
Southern oh my god i can do southern i.

That one mercy.
I need you.
Bing-bong linglong do it over ding dong.
Eating john little and scene.
I am improv the song at the end i'm sure.
You guys can get the rights i even.
Thought about some other jobs that are.
Not entertainment related i mean i've.
Never been opposed to a regular.
Nine-to-five job or a part time job i.
Probably won't initially get the best.
Job because i dropped out of college so.
I'd like a normal job you know one that.
Requires basic skill i mean i have a ton.
Of amazing advanced basic skill i could.
Wait tables i mean i've done that before.
Just in case it gets you know a little.
Windy or out here anything else you guys.
Need and you you know what i didn't take.
Your order yet huh.
I'll be back oh was that me dwayne.
Johnson yeah oh she could be a.
Babysitter i mean i raised my dogs is.
They were puppies it's basically the.
Same thing if no one wants to hire me.
Uber driving i'll be my own boss i.
Actually think i would be an amazing.
Uber driver i mean look at me i'm aja.
You know what they say about asian.
Drivers rex oh great.
Driver yep better buckle up and if none.
Of the other things work out the very.
Last thing i thought about doing and.
Trust me this is the last thing i could.
Think of i thought about going back to.
School and getting my degree in nuclear.
Medicine which was my original plan.
Before i dropped out but the thing is.
I'm a different person now okay a whole.
Decade has passed since i've been in.
College with all the knowledge that i.
Gained over the years here on youtube.
This time around college is gonna be.
Like nothing hey you um you wanted to.
See me yes ryan this was supposed to be.
Your final thesis essay and you starting.
It off with hey guys yes i know it is.
It's a little rough in the beginning but.
It builds it's a pillar essay and it.
Gets better like by the conclusion it's.
Pretty strong with that being said thank.
You for reading if you like this thesis.
Please leave an a and be sure to.
Subscribe for more essays coming soon.
They are coming.
You can't honestly expect me to accept.
This can you i mean this is ridiculous.
What first off you didn't even type it.
Out and not only did you not type it out.
But you never write in a pen you use.
Pencil well note that i could definitely.
And i can convert that if you give me.
Like two or three days and how many.
Times have i told you i do not want you.
Using puns in your essays i honestly do.
Not recall writing the single one in.
There like if if there is a point it's.
Probably my thesis i will prove that a.
Plant can survive off the flash of a.
Camera guess you could call it my.
Photosynthesis lol yeah i should have.
Took the lol oh right students at this.
University has been months months.
Working on their essays and we spent one.
Maybe an hour and tops okay no okay that.
Is that part is untrue okay you know.
What that is that is just a that is a.
Sort of machine that doesn't take coins.
It's nonsense.
Because the ending statement alone took.
Me over an hour maybe even more than.
That really.
Yeah this just took you an hour the four.
Sentences four sentences that that's.
Ending see that's a conclusion on the.
Back of that back of one at the end.
Music.
It's supposed to get out okay overall.
What i'm trying to say is there's gonna.
Be changes on this channel and i know.
That a lot of you praise me and respect.
Me for not changing my content over the.
Years but this is something i have to do.
For myself now that doesn't mean that.
I'm gonna stop posting the videos that.
You guys are used to it just means that.
In between those videos because you know.
Those videos take a lot longer to make.
Sometimes a couple weeks to a month.
Sometimes two months i am gonna be.
Posting other things as well the other.
Things that i've been too afraid to pull.
It's like rants that don't necessarily.
Have skits in them or skits that don't.
Necessarily have vlogs ridiculous songs.
That we've made that make me and my.
Friends laugh probably not you guys know.
Podcast that i've been wanting to do and.
I know it's not something completely.
Unique every youtuber has one now but.
We've already done a few and i just love.
Doing them i love being able to just.
Talk about things on a deeper level with.
People and not not just comedy things.
That actually matter to the world it's a.
Whole nother side to me that you're.
