I am one of the few candidates in the.
Field that donald trump has never.
Tweeted at or acknowledged for a young.
Person now you're looking at a less than.
Fifty percent chance of doing better.
Than your parents i will share what's.
Going on with aliens of the american.
People unless it's just too damn scary.
All right clappy claps and we're good.
Welcome back to another episode of off.
The peel podcast today we have a very.
Special guest well first of all we have.
David choi in the moderator seat we have.
Michelle phan joining us as a co-host.
And we have pretty popular right now.
Andrew yang andrew yang so crazy i need.
This like help the chief you can't you.
Can't hear it but there's a lot of pause.
So again this is i've been tweeting and.
Stuff about it all week that i'm pretty.
Terrified this is very different for me.
But thank you so much for being here in.
Our little or a little setup right here.
In la no man i'm thrilled to be here and.
You know i've been in touch for a little.
While like i've been looking forward to.
This for a while i've been wondering do.
You actually run your twitter because i.
Was wondering if i was talking to you in.
You know indians or is it someone else.
It's me with a little plus sign next to.
It like dip in there and do stuff yeah.
Well like the tweets of all like like.
You were talking about like the like.
Basketball and football is that i'm a.
Second only me okay.
I'd be very troubled if someone else.
Pretended to take over my sports fan.
Don't make me like you know 49ers.
Panting some    i just yeah i mean.
You know my teams are terrible jets its.
Jets mets oh nets i suppose you'd have.
To say no i was a long time they.
Transfer my entire life until they.
Dumped jeremy'll and honestly and then i.
Was like    this    was a bright.
Brightest spot of being a knicks fan for.
Years and then they drop him and then.
You're like why did you drop him and.
You'd put up with so much stuff leading.
Up to that time so then i became a nets.
Fan because jeremy okay i was playing.
There and.
And you left and now i'm still in that.
Span because now i'm friendly with the.
Incoming owner joe tai who's oh.
Taiwanese canadian i don't know if you.
Know about this i know the ownerships.
Changing right.
The ownerships changing from prokhorov.
The russian oligarch who spent money to.
Joe toye who's like this taiwanese.
Canadian badass he's essentially like he.
Went to high school in college in.
America so he's essentially in my mind.
Like you know pretty american but he's.
Gonna be the first asian and be a owner.
I believe.
Oh really yeah so he's gonna own the.
Brooklyn nets so if you have no sports.
Allegiance in the nba and you're you.
Know like opened a new team and might be.
The brooklyn nets okay okay well that's.
I mean that's i didn't even know that.
Honestly i'm a bad agent for not knowing.
That so you you were a fan of jeremy lin.
Like you say how do you feel about mail.
Then oh you know i mean now melo is that.
A bad rap tamala should clearly be in.
The league and i hope the nets sign him.
But at the time when they dumped jeremy.
Lin you know that you had this a little.
Bit of the sense that melo was not too.
Upset that they dumped lin and said it.
Was a period when i was sort of sad.
About melo okay so it's true you do.
Actually watch basketball clearly i was.
Always wondering you know you never know.
You know if you had a basketball.
Ghostwriter yeah that'd be pretty.
Difficult oh one of the reasons why i.
Wanted to come on with you all is that.
That i'm really a pretty normal dude i.
Mean you'd have to be a fairly weird.
Person run for president so there is.
That one thing but the things that you.
Like i probably like to i think that's.
One of the reasons why i mean i'd.
Gravitate towards i mean i i told you.
From the very beginning like i don't.
Know why you would want to be on the.
Show because i don't know much about.
Politics and you said that's exactly why.
You want to do it well first asian.
Americans are not that into politics.
Generally we vote at lower levels we.
Donate money at lower levels we run for.
Office at lower levels and i tell people.
Very plainly it's like when you're.
Growing up and certainly the way i grew.
Up it's not like your parents were like.
You're gonna be president someday it was.
I get good grades.
Make a good living do something reliable.
And consistent and politics is not.
Something certainly i was emphasized in.
My household i think that's true in most.
Asian americans households and so one.
Thing i'm grateful for is that i think.
My campaign can help energize asian.
Americans in a different way but if you.
Arrive to the scene like you just said.
Where you're not that into politics that.
Would be totally normal and to me it's.
One of the you know the things i'd like.
To help change because if we don't get.
Politically engaged at some point then.
Things are just gonna keep on changing.
In ways then we might not like mm-hmm.
Yeah i mean i think the only time that i.
Really got into it was when trump was.
Running right so i i mean that's when i.
Finally was like kind of getting.
Interested and i guess that's the one.
Thing you can say that he did do is.
Bring a lot of injuries i mean like you.
Said it's like a reality show and he's a.
Star so he got a lot of people to care.
About politics now let's say that and.
Then now again talking to a lot of my.
Friends they all know who you are nice.
They do they do but i will say there is.
Some pessimism where they everybody.
Keeps telling me cuz i don't really know.
That much and i'm a certain they do know.
More they keep telling me like yeah we.
Love andrew yang but there's no way he's.
Gonna win well stranger things have.
Happened in american politics that's for.
Sure so right now i'm at 3%.
Nationally and i was five percent in one.
State poll and just like the people.
Watching this right now most folks in.
Iowa new hampshire have not tuned in and.
Have no idea who they're voting for.
Right so anyone who tells you that they.
Know what's gonna happen is lying.
Because no one knows better what data.
You have a you know you have your hands.
On and the fact that we've gone from.
00 in the polls and i'm.
Gonna be on the debate stage in houston.
This week to me that's actually a harder.
Leap to make than being in sixth place.
Raising millions of dollars being in all.
The mainstream news outlets and then.
Going from 6 to 1st in part because the.
Honest truth is that if you look at.
Canada the candidates who are above me.
People have reservations about frankly.
All of them well use nobody thought.
Those same people who said no the.
No way trump was gonna win so right.
There was a point when there was a lot.
There were a lot of people that said.
There's no bomb was gonna win yeah you.
Know and i said too it's like no you.
Guys this is gonna date me a little bit.
Bill clinton kind of came out of nowhere.
He was like the no name governor in.
Arkansas no one was like clinton's gonna.
Clinton's gonna come and save the day.
Like so.
Stranger things have happened in.
American politics than my becoming.
President in 2020 right you're one of.
Your main messages in your campaign is.
You be i'm sure you've talked about it a.
Million times but for some of our.
Listeners that don't really know what.
That is we have a lot of young younger.
Listeners what what exactly is that so.
You know universal basic income is a.
Policy where every citizen gets a.
Certain amount of money to meet your.
Basic needs to do whatever you want with.
So my plan the freedom dividend would.
Put $1,000 a month into the hands of.
Every american starting at age 18 so if.
You're 18.
You'd get $1,000 a month if you're 16.
And you wait two years you'd get $1,000.
A month and that seems incredibly.
Dramatic but this was a plan that was.
Approved by the house of representatives.
In the us congress in 1971 this was a.
Plan that was championed by martin.
Luther king in 1968 this is a plan that.
Has sort of been adopted in one state.
Alaska where everyone in alaska gets.
Between one and two thousand dollars a.
Year in oil money so if you were family.
At four you're getting $8,000 in alaska.
And what i'm saying to the american.
People is that technology is the oil of.
The 21st century we're now your data our.
Data is worth more than oil and and.
That's a true fact.
And you all in many ways are an example.
Of this 21st century economy and here we.
Are in your beautiful southern.
California david's house home slice.
Studio but i mean it's awesome like this.
Conversation is going to be seen or.
Heard by hundreds of thousands maybe.
Millions of people i mean that that's.
Something that's very recent it's like a.
New innovation and there are many things.
That are happening in our economy that.
Are unprecedented so if we cling to this.
Notion that everyone's gonna work a.
Nine-to-five and you're paid in twelve.
Bucks an hour and.
It's gonna work out it's gonna work out.
For fewer and fewer people over time and.
In my view this is why donald trump won.
In 2016 is that more and more americans.
Are feeling like it's not working for.
Them mm-hmm well i mean again those same.
People keep because i asked them because.
I want to know like oh what questions.
Should i ask cuz i don't know enough a.
Lot of them and i've seen your answer to.
How are you gonna pay for this and you.
Bring up amazon and the vat tax i don't.
Completely understand what a vat tax is.
Can you explain that.
Like really dumb down though sure so.
Amazon's a trillion dollar tech company.
Paying zero in taxes right now less than.
I mean you all you know pay much more.
Than zero percent i'm sure and so that's.
Not an exaggeration they're paying zero.
They're paying zero oh yeah that's not.
Like zero is not a number so and it's.
Not unusual like if you look at their.
Lifetime taxation rate it's something.
Like three percent so there'll be zero.
In some years five in others so you have.
To ask yourself okay you're gonna have a.
Revenue problem in this country if your.
Biggest companies are paying zero are.
Near zero in taxes and it's not just.
Amazon it's google its facebook its.
Netflix netflix also paid zero in taxes.
Last year so these are some of the.
Biggest companies in our society and so.
Then you look at it and say okay why are.
They paying zero and the reason they're.
Paying zero is we have a corporate.
Income tax system that is pretty easy to.
Game you pay your executives a lot and.
Stock compensation you can expense that.
You have a global business you can push.
All of the earnings through ireland or.
The caymans or a bahamas or whatever the.
Heck and so these companies play a lot.
Of games and so then you look and say.
Well what did other countries do when.
They were faced with the same situation.
And every other advanced economy in the.
World has something called a value-added.
Tax where if you're selling something.
Then you pay a toll and so if you.
Imagine that in amazon's case then all.
Of a sudden you'd have a lot of tax.
Revenue very very quickly because they.
Sell a lot of stuff so instead of zero.
In taxes you would get billions and so.
That's the change i want to make and the.
Trick with my plan is that i want to.
Take the billions we get from amazon.
And then give it to us in the form of.
$1,000 a month so then if you get this.
Money what are you gonna spend it on.
You're gonna spend a little bit of it on.
Amazon again but you're gonna spend on.
Other things you want like in your case.
It might be food clothing education a.
Car something along those lines and then.
That money just flows back into the.
Economy and ends up creating a virtuous.
Cycle and so that the plan is to try and.
Get more of the value into our hands and.
Then take a toll when we're spending.
Money with companies like amazon so what.
What happens then if so do you plan on.
Imposing some some rules and regulations.
So that these big corporations can't you.
Know create companies like in the cayman.
Islands or ireland like you mentioned.
Well this is the beauty of a david that.
If they decide to move themselves they.
Came in islands and then they celled us.
A still have to pay the toll that's why.
These other countries have done this and.
It's like oxygen it's much harder to.
Game because these companies are very.
Smart and they're very good at avoiding.
Paying taxes sure so how much revenue.
Can be generated from taxing these big.
Corporations the the estimates are that.
If you were to adopt a value-added tax.
At half the european level you would.
Generate about 800 billion in new.
Revenue per year in the united states.
Which is enough to pay for a lot of.
Things and it's enough to pay for a lot.
Of this thousand dollars a month that's.
Coming to each of us and then the beauty.
Of this thousand dollars a month.
Dividend that we all have is that when.
We spend it it just ends up making the.
Economy work better generates another.
Hundreds of billions in new revenue.
Because your economy has more jobs and.
Activity so we get some of that money.
Back we also save money on things like.
Jails and hospitals and homelessness.
Services because a lot of those people.
Need less help and then we're making our.
People stronger healthier mentally.
Healthier more productive also more.
Entrepreneurial and artistic because if.
You imagine a country where everyone's.
Getting a thousand bucks a month how do.
More people would want to do what you.
Guys are doing right now.
Absolutely working for necessity yeah.
Also not worried about literally like.
Starving the next month and i've been a.
Serial entrepreneur now for years and.
Years it is almost never the case that.
Someone's like oh my gosh i'm down to my.
Last dime you know i'm gonna do i'm.
Gonna start a business the way it works.
It's really like when you start a.
Business often you have a little bit of.
Security and you feel like you can take.
A risk so we do is we making our entire.
Culture more entrepreneurial and more.
Enterprising mm-hmm so this is for.
Millionaires and billionaires they still.
Get the same thousand dollars a month.
Well the way the system works is that.
Someone like jeff bezos would end up.
Paying hundreds of millions into the.
System and so if we try and send them a.
Thousand bucks a month to remind them.
He's an american he probably take it too.
Because you know rich people didn't get.
To being rich by turning that money so.
There's some some people here saying.
That you are a socialist what do you.
Have to say to those people well i'm a.
Serial entrepreneur who's run businesses.
And what i say to people is that this is.
Not socialism this is capitalism where.
Income doesn't start at zero us having.
Money it's good for businesses it's good.
For markets it's good for consumers and.
Then if you were to get technical and.
Very asian and smart you would say the.
Definition of socialism is when nation's.
Government takes over the means of.
Production which is not what anyone's.
Talking about here what i'm talking.
About is sliding some money to us we're.
The owners of the country and so this.
Money is gonna go back into the economy.
I see you really seem to like running.
With the the asian stereotypes i have no.
Issue with it.
But i can see some people being.
Sensitive about that especially other.
Asians and is there is that intention or.
Is that just always been you like no.
Math thing and then you know talking.
About like like you just said you're an.
Asian i'm asian that likes math i mean.
This is just playing along because you.
Know you know middle america is gonna i.
Mean there's a certain way they view.
Asian people right yeah so i know that.
We have a very diverse community and.
That the model minority myth is not an.
Accurate depiction of the way.
Many many or most asian americans.
Experience life and so certainly the.
Last thing i'd want to do is somehow.
Perpetuate stereotypes that aren't you.
Know like helpful to the community but i.
Think most people can tell that i'm.
Joking they are serious but they're.
Positive ones and you definitely know.
Your math that's for sure thanks man.
So so i think people generally know that.
Like i'm sort of poking fun at both.
Myself and the images and yeah it's like.
Most people taking the same spirit right.
But i think like you know i mean just.
Based off the internet i'm sure you see.
Voices and opinions from everyone i'm.
Thinking like when you become the.
Nominee right don't you think that's.
Gonna be used against you a lot like i.
Mean even i can just picture like trump.
Being like you know how are you gonna.
Work with china conflict of interest you.
Know well our office has a wager on what.
His nickname is gonna be for me and.
We've come up with comrade yang okay.
Because it's a little racist a little.
Like communist socialist and i think.
People are going to realize that it's.
Not gonna work so well on me and part.
Because if you listen to me for five.
Seconds like i sound like the least.
Socialist dude around because i'm.
Literally like you know like an.
Entrepreneur who's run businesses and i.
Think the anti asian thing is also a.
Real loser for him you know what's.
Really interesting is that i am one of.
The few candidates in the field that.
Donald trump has never tweeted at or.
Acknowledged and he said something at a.
Rally in west virginia where he said.
He's excited to run against all the.
Democrats and his only concern is that.
Someone new comes out of nowhere.
Mm-hm and that's me i'm a similar.
Profile that i'm from outside the system.
And i am one of only two candidates in.
The field that over ten percent of.
Donald trump voters said that they would.
Support and so that means if i'm the.
Democratic nominee we win in part.
Because the attacks that he would use on.
Politicians don't really work on me.
Speaking of donald trump and.
10% now you mentioned how do you plan on.
Reaching out to the the rest of the 90.
No i i'm one of the candidates who's.
Willing to go on fox like talk to people.
From different yeah parts of the aisle.
And i can make you know it's been fun.
It's like i've been meeting tons of.
Trump voters campaigning around the.
Country and a lot of them like me in.
Part because they can tell that i'm not.
Really talking down to them in any way.
Like i just look at them like hey yeah.
Like some of the    really sucks like.
We gotta try and solve some problems.
Like oh that's different.
Oh dude even in the debates you talked.
About it not having like everybody was.
Talking about you not having a tie you.
Know and how why does that matter.
So much like why is that it as important.
Especially brian williams man what the.
Heck's with brian williams and his.
Fixation on neckwear well i mean i think.
That's what what i mean that's my for.
Once i feel like when i'm watching the.
Debates and i hear you talk i feel like.
For me personally i'm actually.
Interested and i tried to figure out am.
I biased because you're asian or is it.
Just because the way you.
I don't know pretty much just seemed.
Like a normal person.
It doesn't seem staged if that makes.
Sense i'm sure you're calculating yeah.
Thank you i'm happy to say that there.
Are many people of every different.
Background and said the same thing to me.
White black asian or you're like oh you.
Seem like a normal dude that's one.
Reason why i'm here having this.
Conversation with you all is that i.
Wanted to lean into the fact that i'm a.
Normal dude who decided to run for.
President because i saw how    up.
Is getting and it's not gonna.
Unfuck itself honestly i mean like it's.
Really broken very very badly broken i'm.
Now deep in the process i'm sixth in the.
Race to become the nominee and i see how.
Badly we need to win because i see the.
Machinery around me and it's not.
Designed to solve the problems it's.
Designed to make certain people money is.
Designed to keep certain things the same.
So certain people can make money and the.
People problems challenges of this era.
Are secondary the feedback mechanism in.
Our government is essentially broken and.
It's one reason why donald trump became.
Our president is that.
Tens of millions of americans were so.
Fed up they were like let's take the bed.
On the nurses history aldi tv star wants.
To drain a swap it can't be worse than.
What we're getting now and so that.
That's the lesson that democrats need to.
Really listen to this time around where.
You can't say you know what our antidote.
Is gonna be business as usual because.
Many americans don't think business as.
Usual was working and many americans.
Made the same choice that you all have.
Made which is like i'm just not gonna.
Pay attention this    because it's not.
Relevant to my life it's depressing.
They're talking about stuff that in ways.
That does not seem relevant to me so the.
Fact that it's a very rational choice to.
Ignore this stuff is a sign of the fact.
That we need to change things so besides.
The thousand dollars a month that you.
You're proposing how do we have a lot of.
Younger viewers here and a lot of.
First-time voters as well why should.
These young volts vote for you like.
Besides $1,000 a month i'm really.
Passionate about this because how old.
Are you all 29 29 32 33 i'm 44 and what.
I'm passionate about is that we have.
Left a total mess to young people in.
Particular and then the worst thing is.
We blame them for it they're like.
Somehow it's your fault we're i mean the.
Clearest examples are that we've gotten.
Rid of a lot of the secure livelihoods.
And jobs moving forward ninety-four.
Percent of the new jobs that are getting.
Created in the united states are a.
Temporary gig or contract work that.
Don't have benefits and have a very.
Precarious path forward thank you bird.
Driver as an example our youtuber or.
Youtuber because i know you guys have to.
Scratch and claw i get it and then you.
Have to you know you put out a video and.
Then you have to be like oh how's it.
Gonna perform and then you know it's.
Like it's it's hard like everything's.
Hard so that's where the economy has.
Gone and then we made college two and a.
Half times more expensive where you look.
At the price tags holy cow then someone.
Just told me today like you know some of.
These schools like 60,000 a year so if.
You want to attend for four years it's.
Like quarter of a million dollars so if.
You're a young person watching this.
You're like what the f you know you're.
Looking up at that and and then you look.
At climate change and say hey.
Turns out why there's gonna get worse.
And it's gonna get hotter the sea levels.
Gonna rise they're gonna be storms and.
Floods and droughts and problems active.
Shooter drills in schools you go to.
School me like what the heck's going on.
Like kids actually i to practice for.
This stuff so if you're a young person.
You look up and say why does it seem.
Like things are going so poorly and that.
The world i'm inheriting is not really.
Set up for me to thrive and succeed and.
Be happy and prosperous and that even.
Have a secure livelihood by the numbers.
And i'm a numbers person if you were.
Born in the 1940s the united states of.
America you had a 93 percent chance of.
Doing better than your parents that's.
The american dream like you know your.
Kids are gonna do better than you are if.
You were born in the 1990s which i guess.
Is some of you right yeah you're down to.
A 5050 chance and guess where the doubt.
To thousands are going it's not going.
Back up so in 93 5050 and then for a.
Young person now you're looking at a.
Less than 50% chance of doing better.
Than your parents you know who's figured.
This out your parents they're looking up.
Being like wow i'm not sure my kids.
Gonna have a better life you know what.
Else is figuring it out the kids kids.
Are like why does it seem like things.
Are not gonna go better for me so this.
Is the mess the shambles that young.
People are inheriting and then young.
People are being blamed for it because.
We're saying it's like somehow your.
Fault because culture lazy smartphone.
Social me i don't know even what the.
Accusation is millennial being a.
Millennial right well if you want to pay.
Your dues whatever like the nonsense.
Narrative is to clarify when you see a.
Better life what exactly cuz you said.
You did the math on it like what exactly.
Are the calculations like what are you.
Basing that off of just money or yeah so.
So when i said the 93 percent of 50.
Percent a little better life right.
That was straight socio-economic success.
Are you gonna make more money than your.
Parents do okay yeah now is that the.
End-all be-all obviously no i mean.
There's there are a lot more important.
Things in life than your paycheck but if.
You had to go society-wide and try and.
Figure out are things getting better or.
Worse for people that would be a good.
Place to start so so if you're a young.
Person you have these concerns and.
Misgivings about the world you're.
Inheriting the country are being left.
You're not sure the country is really.
Working for you and it is not working.
For you.
It's right now not even designed to work.
For you so the goal has to be to change.
That and i'm a parent now i've got six.
And four year old boys and i want to be.
Able to look them in the eyes and say.
We're gonna leave you a country that we.
Can actually be proud of that is as good.
As the country i came to and my parents.
Immigrated this country met as graduate.
Students at berkeley here in california.
They had me and my brother and it's been.
Great you know in the sense that they.
Came here for better opportunities and.
My you know i just became an uncle.
Yesterday like my yeah i haven't met her.
Yet because i'm busy campaigning that.
Affected your like your actual personal.
Life like i'm sure i mean i'm not sure.
Actually with your wife and your kids.
Like is it's got to be tough and it's.
Gotta be there's gotta be some oh and.
I'm just assuming things right now most.
Of us are fighting it's stressful or.
Like not there no it's very human man.
It's the biggest downside of running for.
President is i don't get to see my kids.
As often i'm on the road a lot i would.
Miss my you know i have paced time my.
Wife this morning.
She's been a superstar champ she's been.
A rock if anyone's making a sacrifice in.
This race it's her because my kids are a.
Lot of where all kids are a lot of work.
Like my kids are a lot of work and so i.
Want to be able to do that work with her.
But i'm not able to right now so she's.
Taking it on the chin yeah it's it's a.
Definite change in your personal life.
Yeah that's the biggest downside of.
Running for sure was she all in when you.
Told her you're gonna do this or was she.
Like this is crazy oh well there's.
Definitely part of the crazy element it.
Was there but she thinks that i'm being.
Driven by a higher purpose she's.
Christian and and believes that i'm.
Doing what i'm meant to do are you as.
Well i grew up in a secular household.
But i've many family members who were.
Brought up christian and obviously my.
Wife's christian and we're raising our.
Boys a christian so i go to church every.
Sunday i'm home.
But i grew up secular okay i wanted to.
Go back to the changes that you want it.
To make so let's say hypothetically.
Speaking you become president you have.
Four years do you actually think you can.
Make a meaningful impact knowing that a.
Lot of different sectors like the energy.
Sector big pharma they're owned by.
Lobbyists and you were just mentioning.
That earlier i was just curious to see.
Like what is your strategy if you want.
To make change yes so so thousand bucks.
I want to be a game changer for tens of.
Millions of americans so then the next.
Step is how do we get the government.
Working for us instead of the lobbyists.
And right now the lobbyists have.
Essentially taken captive our.
Legislature legislators so the way we.
Break that captivity is we give everyone.
In america who's an adult again 100.
Democracy dollars a year that you can.
Only give to candidates or campaigns or.
Causes that you like in value this would.
Wash out lobbyist money by a factor of.
Eight to one because you have to look up.
And say what rules can i put in place.
That'll keep the rich people and the.
Corporation's from getting a hold of the.
Legislators very very hard it's like.
Life in jurassic park money finds a way.
You know i mean like the corporate.
Lobbying money would just like still get.
Its way in there and so the new plan.
Should be to wash out the corporate.
Money with people-powered money i've.
Been running for president now for a.
While and i have to say i'm incredibly.
Fortunate where we've now raised.
Millions of dollars in increments of.
Only like $25 each just people donating.
You know 15 20 dollars to the campaign.
But for the vast majority of people who.
Are running for office they have two.
Things they're the people and they have.
The money and so over time they started.
Listening for the money because it's.
Easier to measure the food is better the.
People can give them jobs afterwards i.
Think this is where they end up falling.
So we have to do is we have to combine.
These two things we have to make it so.
The people the money are in the same.
Place and then if you're a legislator.
And the lobbyist comes and says hey i've.
Got a $50,000 check for you you can be.
Like i'm getting five million from my.
Voters my constituents i'm not gonna go.
Against them for your $50,000 but right.
Now asking.
Legislators to ignore all the money when.
That's where the bread is buttered is.
Just not realistic so this democracy.
Dollar that you're talking about is this.
Essentially us dollar well you know the.
Great thing is democracy dollars it's.
Been rolled out in certain communities.
Here in the us it's been rolled out in.
Other countries so you can even imagine.
It being something as simple as you get.
A coupon code and the beginning of the.
Year and then any time you want to give.
To a candidate or campaign just use your.
Coupon code and then they you know.
Reference the code against the federal.
Database and then they just get the.
Money also accepting cryptocurrencies.
I was curious on what are your thoughts.
On bitcoin i've many friends in the.
Cryptocurrency community and i'm a.
Believer in the underlying technology in.
Particular the blockchain has a world of.
Potential it's like a lot of other.
Technologies where right now the hype.
Sort of got a little bit overblown and.
Ahead of itself and the rest of it but.
Then the underlying technology is very.
Powerful and so what happens in these.
Cycles it tends to be that the hype gets.
In front of it and then the air comes.
Out of the bubble but then the reality.
Ends up catching up over time have you.
Thought about i mean this is just.
Hypothetical uvi could essentially be.
Universal bitcoin income no instead of.
The money being taxed essentially it.
Could be based on a hard asset like a.
Bitcoin yeah.
Toshi's is you know you can fraction out.
Satoshi's 100 million units 100 million.
Units to people i love where your head.
Is oh because i learned a lot from my.
Friends in the cryptocurrency community.
Around some of these principles and when.
You start to think it's one reason why.
Just about everyone in the.
Cryptocurrency community loves the idea.
Of universal basic income or the freedom.
That you care about and you believe yeah.
I mean facebook they made so much money.
Make so much money and and so what i say.
To people sometimes is like do remember.
Getting your data check in the mail it's.
Like no but someone's getting your data.
Check in the mail i mean these trillion.
Dollar tech companies are profiting to.
The tune of billions of dollars off of.
Our data.
The interesting thing is our data could.
Actually become more valuable if we were.
Participating in some way right now it.
Just gets kind of anonymized and sold.
And resold without our knowledge and it.
Could become more valuable if we were.
Part of the part of the process do you.
Have any plans to implement that like.
How would you go about that yes i do.
So one of the policies on yank 2020.
Comm is your data as a property right.
And so the plan would be to say to.
Companies that are profiting from our.
Data that there are a few principles you.
Have to adhere to.
Number one is you have to tell us what.
You're doing and how much money you're.
Making.
Number two is you have to let us express.
Preferences as to how much or how little.
Of our data that we want to be made.
Available and number three you have to.
Let us turn it off if we want but part.
Of the number one is like tell us how.
Much value there is is that they have to.
Share the value with us so i'm just.
Being i'm a normal dude so what did.
Normal dudes do when they see that giant.
Like you know click and agree thing they.
Just ignore all right i mean like that's.
What we all do and so we should be able.
To keep doing that because i love.
Convenience as much as the next person.
But if you're making money off me you.
Have to cut me in on the deal yeah and.
So yeah and so that that's where what i.
Want us to be at is essentially at a.
Certain point you express your.
Preference you're being a look i love.
Convenience just give me some of the.
Convenience back to my pocket and then.
If i ever want to change my mind on that.
I can do so right just for like i mean.
Like a ballpark cuz i have no idea what.
Kind of numbers are you thinking for a.
Person's you know i have no idea how.
Much that's worth so right now the art.
Data is worth a different amount.
Depending upon who you are if you travel.
A lot your data's worth a lot more.
Because then they just want to sell you.
Like hotel chains and stuff and stuff if.
You have some kind of health condition.
Your data is worth a lot more sometimes.
People's health data is getting sold for.
Thousands of dollars per user per user.
Based on how much you consume.
Essentially whether it's there yeah.
There different factors that affect how.
Valuable your data is but it can get.
Into the.
Per user but you are saying you want to.
Take a piece of that and give it to the.
Person who's essentially given it yes.
Because it's so dope i mean why who else.
Should be getting the well most of us.
Didn't know it was even happening you.
Know i mean until that documentary came.
Out recently on netflix telling us.
Basically it was good timing yeah.
Seriously okay.
Yeah we should go into the environment.
So you mentioned that man you mentioned.
We're 10 years but i mean like that's i.
Appreciate the honesty.
We're 10 years late when it comes to.
Saving the environment what are some.
Things that you want to do as you know.
As president to kind of slow this thing.
Down.
Yeah the climate change we have to do a.
Whole lot more i just at least a.
Five-point plan which includes some of.
The stuff you probably hear from other.
Places which is try and move towards.
Renewables the big piece of the puzzles.
That 85% of the world's emissions are.
From non-us sources so if you want to.
Try and curb emissions in a serious way.
Then you have to go to africa and say to.
Them you know that coal burning power.
Plant that china is installing for you.
For free i'm going to try and convince.
You that these solar panels and wind.
Turbines are a better option and so then.
You have to subsidize that to a very.
High degree if you're gonna make that.
Competitive the third thing is that we.
Should be trying to make our communities.
More resilient and literally and.
Figuratively move our people to higher.
Ground where you know if there's a.
Hurricane who suffers poor people who.
Don't have great shelter or cars and get.
Into to drive away and anyone who thinks.
This stuff is a little doom and gloom.
We were already moving climate refugees.
In the united states we already took a.
Town of people in louisiana where their.
Land had essentially become underwater.
And uninhabitable and we said well it's.
Time to move you so if we're doing that.
There then we should start looking at.
Other places where frankly that's.
Starting to happen and it's happening in.
More and more places around the country.
Not just louisiana the fourth thing is.
That we have to try and undo some of the.
Damage we're doing so that involves.
Reforesting tracts of land it involves.
Trying to repair some of the oceans by.
Seeding plankton beds it sounds a little.
Far out but four to eight percent of.
Marine life in the atlantic ocean is.
Dying now every year so if you.
Extrapolate that over time you're.
Talking about massive massive problems.
And so we can't just try and do less of.
The bad we have to try and undo some of.
The damage so those are some of the.
Plans i have on climate change i just.
Released a 5 trillion dollar plan to try.
And take those steps the these are.
Things that you've i'm assuming you've.
Worked with scientists or something but.
Correct me if i'm wrong you said it's.
Already 10 years too late though right.
It's 10 years too late to keep the earth.
From warming ok the earth is going to.
Warm it is already warming the last four.
Years have been the four warmest years.
In recorded history which sounds like a.
Remarkable coincidence i mean it's not a.
Coincidence it's because the earth is.
Warming july was the warmest year in.
Recorded history so when i say it's ten.
Years too late it's ten years too late.
To keep the earth from warming in a.
Significant and measurable way it's.
Never too late to start trying to repair.
Damage make our communities more.
Resilient make your economy more.
Sustainable there's a proverb the best.
Time to plant the tree is twenty years.
Ago the second best time is now it's.
Like one low situation it's like should.
We have done it 10 years ago or 20 years.
Ago of course in the absence of having.
Done that do we need to take dramatic.
Action now yes essentially you're also.
Providing more jobs like infrastructure.
Jobs for people to build yeah i was just.
With this gonna sound so politician ii.
But i was just with this entrepreneur.
Ned reynolds in new hampshire and he now.
Has 260 solar installers working for him.
Who are just putting panels on people's.
Roofs and that's a really good job and.
We need it and it's gonna make us more.
Energy efficient and it's gonna lower.
People's heating bills so it's just a.
Win-win-win those are the kinds of jobs.
We need to be creating in very large.
Numbers trump said that he brought back.
Many manufacturing jobs more than anyone.
Thought possible is that an accurate.
Statement it's an accurate statement.
That there's been a slight bounce back.
In manufacturing employment but big.
Picture we were at seventeen million.
Manufacturing jobs around.
Thousand and then we went all the way.
Down to 12 million or so so that's five.
Million loss and now we're somewhere.
Between 12 and 13 million so has there.
Been a bounce-back yes have donald.
Trump's policies had something to do.
With it presumably yes is this partially.
Donald trump just blowing his own smoke.
Like usual also yes why is it that.
Whenever i i mean i watch everything not.
Just like fox or cnn or either side.
Whenever i see the pro trump side it's.
Always you know the economy's doing.
Great much better under trump and then i.
Watch i just see connor it's just all.
Counter-arguments and it what's the.
Truth.
Like why are there numbers supposedly.
That support that under trump.
Everything's better the economy the.
Major there there are a few economic.
Moves that donald trump's made the two.
Big ones were a tax cut and the second.
One was the trade war with china so the.
Tax cut cut corporate taxes by 1.5.
Trillion dollars which ended up boosting.
The economy in a particular way that is.
True only 6% of that those gains went to.
Workers the vast majority of it went to.
Shareholders of corporations and.
Buybacks and the rest of it so have you.
Seen better economic numbers at the top.
Line yes.
Was that the right way to go 100% no.
That was a terrible way to go because.
That 1.5 trillion tax cut ended up just.
Boosting deficit which you know we're.
Gonna eventually have to do something.
About and then the trade war has been a.
Huge net negative for the economy so if.
You were to go and say hey donald.
Trump's been good for the economy it's.
Narrowly true if you ignore the fact.
That he also increased our deficit by.
Hundreds of billions of dollars and if.
You were going to for example spend the.
Trillion and a half dollars i've got a.
Great idea why not just give it to the.
American people in the form of a.
Dividend and instead of having it all go.
To corporate buybacks it would go right.
Back in the economy into our hands it.
Would increase the actual health of our.
People because that's what happens when.
Money is in our hands we end up becoming.
Healthier mentally healthier.
Better educated like all these good.
Things happen so to me it was a tragic.
Misuse of resources that went directly.
To the corporations that needed at the.
Least.
Okay so just selective reporting then.
Yeah it's like if you were to want to.
Tell a story it's like trump's been.
Great for gdp it's like just like kind.
Of seen both sides because i don't want.
To just pick one side and just go with.
It because they're so conflicting you.
Know.
Well you summarized a big problem today.
In america is that you have different.
News silos people getting news from.
Different sources no one can agree on.
Anything and some of these channels.
Don't even pretend anymore like.
Sometimes they get called out on bad.
Reporting and they're like we're an.
Entertainment business we're not a news.
Business and you're like are you.
Me do you have any plans on.
Working with those news outlets and.
Maybe i don't know figure out a way to.
Make you more accurate reporting fake.
News and things like that you know i.
Think that's that's gonna become a more.
Serious problem when you have deep fakes.
And technological things that you know.
It's like then you really need someone.
To come in and be like yo that videos.
Not who had a deep fake voice of his.
Convinced the cfo to transfer two.
Hundred and fifty thousand dollars into.
The deep fake voices account so there's.
And this is just the beginning of deep.
Fake sorry what is deep fake it's.
Essentially when you do either a video.
Or audio that sounds like or looks like.
A person but i made it up but now the.
Technology is so good that it's.
Indistinguishable right okay well yeah.
And it's someone distinguishable that.
Even if you know it's a fake you can't.
Actually necessarily like say this is a.
Forgery.
I know it's so frightening i mean that.
Could be like the end of society or.
Worse like you know we can't trust.
Anything we have to confirm each other.
By memory only memory that we go back to.
Campfires what would you say are some.
Things that these young people should be.
Studying in order to secure a job for.
The for the future since ai is.
So here's the good news according to the.
Projections so there's not good news but.
All presenta it's good news the.
Proportion of jobs that are likely to be.
Lost automation the range of estimates.
Is between twenty and forty four percent.
Which still means that a majority of.
Jobs will continue to exist so it's not.
Like you know end of work as we know it.
And the work that will still be.
Available to us all falls into two main.
Categories non repetitive manual work.
And non repetitive cognitive work so.
I'll start with non repetitive cognitive.
This is like team-building interpersonal.
Creative stuff like you do design some.
Of the stem fields so that stuff is.
Going to be with us for a long long time.
Sales like you always gonna need sales.
These sorts of things non repetitive.
Manual are things like plumbing and hvac.
Repair and a lot like can you imagine.
Would take to make a robot plumber be.
Next to impossible yeah it's too.
Expensive so that there so so there are.
Going to be jobs that are with us for a.
Long time on the high end you want and.
What i say to young people and this is.
Gonna sound like that like.
Movie advice you got that there's a peer.
In me like i don't believe that advice.
But it's going to become better advice.
Over time it's really important to find.
Something that you enjoy and like.
Because if you enjoy it then you're more.
Likely to invest time in it and become.
Good at it and develop like skills that.
Are resilient over time so believe it or.
Not if you're a young person you can.
Find something you really enjoy doing.
You should lean into that and a lot of.
That revolves around interpersonal.
Dynamics and skills because.
Team-building is going to become crucial.
Over time in a world where you know.
Dealing with people is going to become a.
Massive value add so that that's one.
Thing i'd say is and it sounds like 80s.
Movie that is advice or something but if.
You can find something you'd like doing.
Just really trying it good at it.
Can we go into foreign foreign policy.
Sure so i get my presidential.
How do you have plans to continue.
President trump's like confrontational.
Approach to china economically and.
Geopolitically.
Well i think one of the traps that the.
Us tends to get itself into is seeing.
The world as a zero-sum game where if.
Someone else is doing better than it's.
Somehow like hurting us and i think that.
Is going to drag us into a cold war with.
China or worse and to me we have to see.
That other countries can become more.
Successful and it's not necessarily a.
Bad thing.
For the us are there things in the.
Us-china relationship that are serious.
Issues that we need to try and address.
Like their piracy of intellectual.
Property and increasingly some of the.
Things they're going to happen in terms.
Of human rights and and there's the.
Protesters and and other things like.
Yeah they are very very serious issues.
But is china's success necessarily.
Destructive to the us like i i don't.
Believe so so we have to take that.
Stance where we protect america's.
National interest but do it in a.
Disciplined way where we also don't.
Confuse economic success in national.
Security.
If something's national security then.
You have to go hard and that that's just.
The stance but the economic interests.
Sometimes get confused with security.
Interests in a way that i think is not.
Very productive what about north korea.
Middle east well i think engaging with.
North korea is not a bad thing i think.
Engaging with foreign leaders that we.
Disagree with is generally productive.
And so i wouldn't you know i wouldn't.
Say that.
You know donald trump did something.
Wrong where he went wrong with north.
Korea is that he kept meeting with kim.
Jong-un without clear parameters in.
Terms of what he needed to get out of.
The meeting either before during and.
Eaze had this all-or-nothing approach to.
The diplomacy and denuclearization where.
There are goals you can set that are.
Short of complete denuclearization that.
Would be very very good for the u.s.
That if you're gonna meet with with them.
And that needs to happen and this is.
Personal for me my sister-in-law's in.
Seoul right now so anything that happens.
In the and the korean peninsula.
You know it actually affects family.
Members if you had to choose what.
Country outside of the usa would you say.
Is doing a pretty good job of running.
Their country i think that denmark in.
The scandinavian countries have done a.
Really good job of helping build robust.
Social safety nets and structures that.
Have helped people manage very very.
Difficult transitions i think we can.
Learn a lot from them but do you think.
They're able to do that because it's a.
Smaller country compared to the us and.
The u.s. being like a melting pot of so.
Many different cultures yeah they have.
Some advantages in terms of their.
Ability to get some of these things done.
And to me one of the great challenges.
For the united states is to be able to.
Get great things done despite being.
Heterogeneous you know like it shouldn't.
Be that we all have to look exactly the.
Same to get big things done you know i.
Mean okay well i mean we were just.
Instructed you have like five more.
Minutes so before you go i have to ask.
You something or ten minutes before you.
Go there's something i want to ask you.
And see this in five minutes so what are.
Your thoughts about aliens and you know.
Bernie sanders came out on joe rogan's.
Podcast which he also did and said.
Basically if he becomes president he is.
Going to what do you say he's gonna like.
Release the information about aliens and.
The truth and stuff like that they do.
But that's what i'm saying like truth.
They get told the truth and we're like.
It's too scary to share i am on the same.
Page i will share what's going on with.
The aliens of the american people unless.
It's just too damn scary don't you think.
That's already happened then like i mean.
I've seen interviews it's like.
Conspiracy theorists say like you know.
Barack obama went on certain interviews.
And he kind of hinted at it but he.
Doesn't want to say it he said he was.
Gonna release that stuff too right so.
Let's just say my threshold for not.
Sharing would be astronomically high.
Like i would share it unless it was like.
We grew up watching every alien movie.
That's where i am you know i think.
Watching x-files yeah so let's just say.
That i would like to be able to be.
Transparent about these things the.
American okay pretty much i'm a regular.
Dude what would a regular.
The situation but like it always seems.
Like that it always seems like a regular.
Dude until they become important right.
They become the president or somebody.
And then and then somebody gets to them.
Gets to them what them yeah i mean yeah.
One of my primary qualification is to be.
President is that i think i'm fairly.
Unchanged through this process become.
President to like there's so many.
Trappings of the office that i could.
Take or leave you know i just want to.
Solve the problems i'm on the record.
Saying like if i could saw the problems.
Not being president i would take that to.
Like i don't have any native intrinsic.
Burning desire to be press which means.
You would help another candidate if you.
Weren't the nominee you'd help another.
Candidate oh yeah i had one of my major.
Life's goals it was to like to elevate a.
Major national candidate and my wife saw.
These goals and you know was not on the.
List be a major you know maybe that's.
Partially an asian thing too you know.
What i mean that's a health or just like.
You want to get the stuff done and like.
Being front and center is not you don't.
Need to be the guy you just want to get.
The solutions yeah that's right in the.
Group project okay america needs.
Solutions and a smart president oh thank.
You for saying so i think so too.
Like a bull version okay well before we.
Get going where can people go to support.
You if you'd like to join the yangyang.
Just go to yang 2020 comm give a buck.
Five bucks it makes a huge difference.
Because the media keeps track of number.
Of donors as a measurement of support so.
Yang 2020 calm you'll see all of my.
Policies and plans there we also have a.
Really fun social media president's not.
As fun as yours but you know we've we.
Have like videos and a lot of people are.
Making art about me and the campaign.
Which is a lot of fun and awesome and.
Some of it mc jin did yang yang anthem i.
Don't know if you saw that i haven't so.
Yang 2020 calm and let's take the.
Country back and make it work for young.
People in particular awesome i always.
Said i was a very interested in you and.
I wasn't.
Consider myself yang yang until i met.
You and i will say the people watching.
The reason why i was hesitant is i want.
To see if you are you when you're not.
You know on tv and stuff and i will say.
You're exactly the same.
Yeah it's thank you again for being here.
It's it's this is a big deal for us like.
