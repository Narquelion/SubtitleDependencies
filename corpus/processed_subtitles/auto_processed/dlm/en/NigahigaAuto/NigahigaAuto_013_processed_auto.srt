Oh hello there i didn't see you come in.
My name is ryan higa also known as ryan.
But you can call me ryan higa for sure.
And i'm a professional badass for years.
I used to be that guy.
That god that people made fun of for not.
Being cool enough i'm not taking any.
Chances my poor rick grimes from walking.
Dead and fresh karl so i created this.
Program to help you to help you yeah.
Yeah weak sensitive not bad ask people.
To become badass people so that from.
This day forward whether you got ten.
Twenty a hundred feelings inside of you.
None of them will ever get broke again.
Double negative ryan higa also known as.
Aka represents step one get it through.
Your helena wait that's step one five.
Steps to be badass step one get through.
Your head in order for others to believe.
You're a badass you have to first.
Believe you're a badass so let me ask.
Yourself this do you ever feel like i.
Don't not not look like a badass even.
Though you never not should not feel.
Like you do not look like badass like.
Exactly the answer is no don't i.
Backwards i don't know.
Now take a good look at yourself right.
Now if i were to hold a mirror up to.
Y'all right now you know what you'd see.
A weak skinny.
Cheap tripod from walmart holding up a.
Camera but if that camera were to take a.
Picture of you right now and you were to.
Upload that picture to iphoto or some.
Other picture editing program using a.
Hustler would you really say that this.
Is you this is what a badass looks like.
No cuz you are a person not a picture on.
A piece of paper you're a man even for.
You women out there you're a man recap.
Step 1 get it through your head and.
Let's move on step 2 stop being a little.
Right now you're a little you're soft.
Easily proved yellow-skinned as much as.
I hate seeing the b word i might use it.
For m passes y'all a bunch of bananas.
Right now if you want to be a real.
Badass you can't be no banana double.
Negative never show weakness.
You ever feel pain you must never show.
It again real badasses never cry even in.
The most painful situations imagine a.
Poor example you walked into your.
Brother's room causing you to step on a.
Lego and now you're trapped don't you.
Ever cry for help all you have to do is.
Use the figure-eight maneuver and figure.
It out you accidentally poured all your.
Milk first and realize you ain't got no.
Cereal left don't you tear a breakdown.
In crime so you'll always go.
On sale it's no big deal get your bike.
Are don't you dare lean get up that's.
Right then brush yourself off limp to.
The nearest electronics store and get up.
Just because you can and last but not.
Least people keep telling you that your.
Puns are not funny and yet you see your.
Puns all over facebook and 9gag other.
Website i thought even given you grin so.
What do you do.
Don't you dare complain about it in a.
Video you create a pun that's so.
Ridiculously stupid that there's no way.
Someone else could take credit for it.
How you ask just by making mints you.
Take a mint coffee imperfectly so it's.
Just right put it in the fridge and boom.
Next time someone tries to steal your.
Bad punch to show them what you made.
Copyright infringement so again to recap.
Step to stop being a little and also.
Don't be a banana and let's move on step.
Move on nobody got time for step 3 step.
2 took too long.
Step 4 have a montage at some point in.
Every badasses live he or she needs to.
Become a man quickly by having a montage.
A manly montage mari all you need to do.
Is do a bunch of manly things and slowly.
Get better at it until you become the.
Manliest a man while being accompanied.
