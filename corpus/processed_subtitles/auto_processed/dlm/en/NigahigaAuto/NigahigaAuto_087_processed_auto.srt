If people know or not but you're hella.
Buff right now uh-huh.
And you're doing you said you're doing.
It for a role yeah i'm about to the.
You talk about yeah yeah yeah i'm.
Playing i'm gonna be playing a.
Korean-american adoptee that's getting.
Deported.
Korean-american adoptee that's getting.
Deported and he lives in the south this.
Is the film that you wrote and you're.
Directing yeah.
Ending your action acting and you were.
Working with the studio a big studio.
Yeah about who you're working with yeah.
I mean the main the main studio is macro.
There's a co-financed here for the film.
But macro made sorry to bother you mud.
Bound they made two of denzel.
Washington's films fences and roman.
Esquire they made yeah you know they.
Made they they made up this film called.
The land you know they do a lot of like.
Super you know ethnic driven films so.
They're like a good partner for this but.
Yeah it's about like you know with like.
Deportation and stuff these days you.
Know we have the dreamers and daca but.
Like part of it that people aren't.
Talking about is people who were adopted.
Here internationally from like the 70s.
And 80s are getting deported people who.
Are adopted here by why you what do you.
Mean by us citizens so you adopted.
Meaning like they flew them like ship.
Them over yeah like you know when you.
Adopt baby from africa or china or korea.
Oh i don't know about that i mean i know.
People do it but ya know see do you know.
Any like real house aren't illegal at.
That point as i'm saying that's why it's.
Really messed up you say that is hat so.
There you go but they're getting.
Deported well yeah what's happening is.
That that that they get brought to this.
Country you know and this is there's a.
Child citizenship act of 2000 so anyone.
Adopted after that gets automatically.
Granted citizenship huh but anyone.
Before that is detected so if they got.
Adopted here and the parents didn't file.
Like the proper paperwork yeah now like.
With the current administration himself.
Ice is so aggressive that they are using.
Loopholes to deport people like that.
Have no connection to their homeland and.
Like you know they were like brought.
Here as kids and you know international.
Adoption a lot of money is exchanged and.
Right it's uh it's.
It's really bad it's really sad dude.
That's hella sad yeah what year was this.
After their okay after 2000 i think is.
When when they you bring so a baby from.
A different country they're protected.
But anyone before which is just a stupid.
Loophole yeah yeah so like you know.
People from as your movie is about.
Though yeah well it's about a guy who is.
Dealing with that and he's uh you know.
Korean-american in and grew up in in the.
South and yeah so like you know he's.
Just trying to get us left he's starting.
To like really get his life together and.
Then bad stuff happens it and then he.
Has to deal with the possibility of.
Getting deported.
Okay well i mean just going back because.
I didn't really for people who don't.
Know who you are.
Justin chon is an actor you've probably.
Seen him in stuff a bunch of things.
You've been acting for i don't know how.
Long for like 18 years 19 18 years and i.
Mean he's you're not really acting as.
Much you're doing more like directing.
And stuff but you were in like a ton of.
Show like yeah i remember you from the.
Nickelodeon show it was that just jordan.
Jordan is just jordan is just jordan.
That part now is that was like the theme.
Song in the beginning i mean i wasn't a.
Big fan of remember i agen dude on it i.
Feel like i feel like you know you know.
Your audience that's listening right now.
Like the age range they probably watch.
Oh they're actually older than really i.
Mean yeah cuz it's podcast so yeah.
People don't really care yeah i.
While you were in twilight was in.
Twilight all of them right yeah yeah but.
I'm like a very small part of it i'm.
Just yeah you're a human dude so is anna.
Kendrick yeah we're in 21 21 and over.
And over not 21 not the card movie yeah.
Oh yay 21 and over yeah wait miles miles.
Teller and skylar astin.
Here in a bunch of stuff man yeah i mean.
Like i said you were in things that i.
Just remember because you're there.
Wasn't many asian people around and you.
Were just like oh asian do it on.
Nickelodeon that's pretty cool.
And then obviously twilight right but i.
Know you know that was fun wasn't it.
Crazy all the people who would played.
Those like.
Like like eight like the human rolls.
Kind of blew up right well anna anna.
Kendrick's huge yeah but yeah like when.
You go back and watching you know like.
Dan that is such a can't believe she.
Played that insignificant role yeah talk.
About twilight and how when you told me.
About it ah how you thought oh my god.
This film well i don't know if you want.
To say what you want to say oh no i.
Think we could talk about it now i mean.
I talk about it then because i think.
People would really want to know but.
First let me let me so let me explain.
Something is when i was gonna do.
Twilight i was just getting off of like.
Like children's television like.
Nickelodeon and doing a bunch of stuff.
For disney and stuff you know and i i.
Always wanted to be like an asian sean.
Penn you know i wanted to be a serious.
Actor so i was planning to really stay.
Away from anything that's kind of like.
You know i wanted to try to find serious.
Roles you do some indie films that are.
And then my agent called me and said.
There's this movie and it's and i think.
You should go out for it's about it's.
About a family of vampires and i hose.
Like hell no can you cuss on this yeah.
You can guess i was just like    no.
Man i don't want to go for that and he.
Was like well dude like you don't have a.
Job you should probably like there's not.
A lot of options for you cuz you know at.
That time you know it wasn't as open as.
It is now yeah so a ginger yeah so like.
The roles are limited so i was just like.
Okay well who's uh who's directing it.
And she he was like catherine hardwicke.
I was like oh and she did a movie called.
Thirteen and lords of dogtown that i was.
Loved resume yeah she she did like indie.
Films i really loved and then i was like.
Well who's a main star like it's in he.
Was like well this girl named kristen.
Stewart i was like oh because i had seen.
A film called into the wild yeah and she.
Has a pardon that she's just so amazing.
In it and i was like i would love to.
Work with her and then and uh and that's.
Why i auditioned and and i auditioned.
Like i don't know six seven times and.
What i mean.
Because it was yeah because it was.
During the writers strike yeah so they.
Couldn't rewrite stuff like so we had to.
Do a lot of improv.
So you go in and and because they.
Couldn't write new stuff we had to go.
And and improvise a lot of scenes with.
The other sort of potential cast members.
And then uh yeah i showed up i was like.
Okay well i'm really excited to work.
With these people but the film itself i.
Don't give a    you know like it's.
Like you know um and you know like the.
Books it's based off books and stuff but.
You know i was really excited to work.
With the people involved but like the.
Actual story i was like well you know.
It's it's just an opportunity and right.
And and but the other thing is it's i.
Don't think they wanted me oh really cuz.
I was asian.
I think catherine erik your key right.
Yeah is that isn't that well i don't.
Know is that a asian character in the.
Book.
No but they don't specify his ethnicity.
Just that he has black hair and like i.
Think like nasty pimply scan or.
Something i don't know but uh but um.
Catherine i think came out recently.
Saying like she had a prob she had.
Problems casting minorities yeah but.
Yeah i don't think they really wanted me.
Because you know was washington forks.
Washington they didn't feel like but uh.
There yeah so catherine fought for me.
And that i am proud of you know anytime.
I can get rolled it isn't meant for me i.
Was really proud of that so um but you.
Know and and the fact that i'm the only.
Asian in that entire series is is pretty.
Cool yeah like it's like another fun.
Fact is like that for those people who.
Don't know you actually did youtube i.
Did yeah i did because um because of you.
Guys.
Hmm he's you and kevin you did it a lot.
I mean they consistently you were.
Consistent for a little bit i did it for.
Like a like a maybe like half a year.
Yeah your intro is i love doing thanks.
But um it's i think he would understand.
How hard work it is how much right how.
Much hard work and i was like dude this.
Is like from not for me hard work hard.
Work your other it's a real career it's.
Real it's its own career and like i.
Can't do it part-time yeah i thought i.
Can maybe like just kind of do it like.
When i have free time but it's not the.
Case like it has to be a full-time game.
You know and i was just too busy like.
Acting and and doing other stuff and.
Just way bigger things no no it's not.
That like i know like youtube is even.
Bigger than like i think if you're on a.
Network television show uh-huh.
No one knows who you are yeah right like.
I was just on a show for abc.
Nobody has ever recognized me from that.
Like no one's ever said oh yeah you're.
That guy for that abc show but like.
People recognize me from your youtube.
Videos.
Yeah yeah well i think it depends on.
Like the size of what your project right.
Cuz you were in i mean like people.
Obviously don't you from twilight.
Because the fan base was so big yeah.
Right once you talk about how you turn.
Down pitch perfect yeah go and this is.
All interesting yeah this is all things.
That i have never talked about i know.
That's all yeah and i think it's so.
Interesting yeah because it's an inside.
World too like a star's life yeah yeah.
Well it's not a start yeah i mean so.
It's to a certain degree yeah but uh.
Yeah i had just finished shooting 21 and.
Over and skylar astin was in 21 and over.
With me and we both got cast in pitch.
Perfect so i went straight over from.
From seattle to i think it was baton.
Rouge or shreveport louisiana so i went.
From one hotel to another and i was like.
Man i just i wasn't um you know i.
Thought i wanted to do it and i showed.
Up and and you know and i was there.
Who's who's you know i love and and nona.
For a long time so like i i was really.
Stoked and then but then um you know we.
Uh got there and i was i saw the reality.
Of what it was what it was it's like a.
Musical mm-hmm.
And you didn't want to do it and i was.
Just like what you sing to like what so.
Like so like yeah the audition was like.
You had to sing a song and and whatever.
And and you know i sent a tape in and.
And i also do think that skylar put in a.
Good word because he got cast as lead.
He's like hey you need to cast this guy.
So i showed up and then so weird then i.
Myself in like dance rehearsal for like.
80 hours a day and then we and then we.
Were also doing like singing rehearsal.
And like and i was just sitting there.
Like in and we're sitting in like a.
Circle we're all picking out parts and i.
Was just trying to do like a falsetto.
And i was like dude this is not i feel.
Like a phony i just don't feel like i.
Belong here cuz han because what you.
Didn't feel feel like your vocals are on.
Point with them or like why like yeah i.
Just i just didn't like it yeah and i.
Just felt like really kind of stupid.
Personal experience is like you know and.
Every day at the end of the day we would.
Kind of show the director the.
Choreography and stuff and you got to.
Get in it you gotta be like beginning.
Like doing the whole dance i gotta.
Commit because you guys someone's not.
Committed to me and and you know i think.
I also talked about i get i i know i.
Could talk about this but like because.
We've hashed it out personally is.
There's an actor named okarche and he's.
Uh he's in everything now he's he's.
Gonna be in britney runs a marathon he's.
He would paid mindy kaling's younger.
Brother in the mindy project he's in.
Mulan he's he's in like a film with ryan.
Reynolds right now he's a huge indian.
American actor okay and i didn't like.
Him and like we we got we were at it.
Like me and him were like and he was.
Like anyway like i don't wanna go ten.
Guys in pitch perfect yeah he's in pitch.
Perfect he plays the riding that guy and.
Me and him didn't get long yeah you know.
I don't want to go too into detail but.
Like i hated him right and he i don't.
Think he liked me either and that was.
Another reason i was like dude and it.
Just like as a week went by i was like i.
Don't i want to get out i don't i don't.
Want to do this and also like 21 and.
Over was talking about doing a reshoot.
In china because they got some chinese.
Money so we had to shoot part of the.
Movie in china yeah and and then also.
Kev wanted me to do some stupid movie.
With him.
Yeah and i was like which is probably.
The dumbest thing i ever did is i gave.
Up pitch-perfect to go do kevin g.
Youtube movie that's that's friendship.
Though that's not very well that's.
Pretty loyal perfectness and you knew i.
Mean it was you had a big budget i mean.
Yeah i knew it was gonna be yeah and i.
In its music and stuff and it's.
Entertaining i knew it was gonna be good.
It's just at that time and sometimes in.
Life you have to do what's best for your.
Soul not for your bank account yeah damn.
That's deep so yeah so i was just like.
You know what i'd rather go chill in.
Hawaii and and and i'm glad i did i mean.
It changed my life you know like spent.
That much time in hawaii and and.
Hawaii's like a second home to me so.
Like i'm glad i did that but like you.
Know um also you know i like i was like.
So just partied out.
I was drinking so much and all that.
Stuff and i was just like i was just.
Kind of done and and hawaii i was like a.
Little bit relaxing and and then i had.
To i went from like being in a hotel and.
To sharing a bed with kevin in like an.
Apartment in hawaii kevjumba for people.
Who don't yeah.
I was yummy were you shooting hang loose.
Mmm okay with dante right yeah yeah i.
Love dante basco you know rufio but yeah.
You know since then you know like if i.
Could just indulge you guys in the.
Conflict between me okarche we test it.
For a a nbc show for a tv show we you go.
What happens you have to go test for a.
Show like for like the the executives.
And and so i made it to the final round.
And then i was just waiting in the room.
To go test and then the elevator opens.
And it was a car sh and we hadn't seen.
Each other since pitch-perfect in the.
Elevator open and he looked at me he's.
Like ah    and i was like i was like.
What the.
And i just like turn this like and then.
And then we were just like you know you.
Have to test a few times yet to test.
Network in the studio and then by the.
The same third day like a conscious i.
Can i talk to you i was like yeah cool.
Man and we went into like an empty room.
While we're waiting to like going to.
Audition and he's like man and i will.
Give it to him like use the bigger man.
He like apologized first and and we.
Pieced it out and.
Maybe you hate him so much like why did.
You guys hate each other so i don't know.
Man i just like i mean we're both.
Different people ya know and i can't.
Like speak on his behalf because it's.
You know i i know what's going on in his.
Life but like i was just i was also a.
Different person yeah and i you know i.
Just we just didn't get along.
You know sometimes you know when you.
Meet somebody for the first time they.
Rub you the wrong way and you you just.
Yeah you just don't vibe with somebody i.
Feel like and here's the thing is.
Sometimes you don't vibe because.
Actually you're a lot more similar than.
You'd like to admit mm-hmm you know and.
You see i think you see parts of.
Yourself in somebody that you don't like.
But you're actually like you're actually.
Like hating on yourself but then you.
Eats your insecurities that make you.
Kind of hone in on that and start to.
Like you know let it bother you but but.
I don't know a car she's a sweetheart.
He's a really amazing guy and and yeah.
We're totally cool now and we've we've.
Hung out a bunch of time since then so.
Like you know i think sometimes that.
Kind of conflict helps you actually.
Become closer i don't know that's i mean.
You want to talk about pitch perfect.
This stuff is like opie we're gonna clip.
It and just send it you like these.
Different actors okay well i mean i did.
Want to because i think that's.
Interesting and yeah super it's an.
Inside look that a lot of people don't.
Get to see definitely yeah um but yeah i.
Mean now you're doing like i said you.
Were did acting for i don't know how.
Long i mean you're still acting but.
Really your claim to fame currently is.
You're directing because you've been.
Directing films and writing them and.
Recently you've had two films make it.
Into sundance back-to-back your last two.
Films both made it into sundance and one.
And one of them won an award.
Yeah yeah right that's huge i don't know.
People know that but getting into.
Sundance is like super prestigious and.
It's it's you know named some other.
Movies that frio station the drumming.
One replies flash you know really tough.
To get into sundance and your last two.
In a row with it you directly got in.
There so right now you're kind of like a.
I mean you're kind of like like cott.
Right now in that world directing.
Inde sort of like anyway did you also.
Write those as well i really you you.
Wrote direct acted and acted in in the.
First movie gu yeah and then i wasn't in.
That my most recent film is purple.
Mm-hmm.
So what's wrong with that when right now.
Miss purple so i went to sundance with.
That this january and it comes on.
Theatres september 6 in la at the newark.
In santa monica and then and then it'll.
Expand in new york in two landmark.
Theaters and then and then um after that.
It'll expand to most major cities you.
Know um i think it's gonna be through.
Landmark theaters but yeah you know it's.
About a strange brother and sister who.
Grew up in like a gentrifying koreatown.
In los angeles and and their dad is is.
Close to passing away he's he's.
Terminally ill and and the daughter has.
Stuck around to care for him and they're.
Live in hospice nurse quits so she's.
Forced to have to contact her brother.
Who and begs him to help help him help.
Her take care of him because she has to.
Make money and work and pay for stuff.
And what she does what she does for work.
Is she's a karaoke hostess and you know.
If you're from la or you're korean you.
Might be familiar with like the told me.
Culture it's like you know you go to.
Kurt you know karaoke room and girls.
Come in they're like kind of like.
Hostesses and they come and hang out.
With guides for money so it kind of.
Explores that world in a way but but.
It's really about a brother and sisters.
Relationship i have a younger sister and.
Our our relationship has been pretty.
Complicated over the years and you know.
I'm dealing with our parents and and.
Kind of divvying up responsibilities and.
I think the the brother-sister.
Relationship specifically is pretty.
Particular because it's like one's a guy.
And what's a girl and and i haven't seen.
That really sort of explored in film you.
Know there's only a few films that that.
Talk about i mean like you know you can.
Count on.
The savages skeleton twins but that's.
About it.
You know i mean i feel like age of 17.
Kind of touched on it because like you.
Know the you know the girl is dealing.
With all this stuff and then you find.
Out the brother you know there was all.
These stuff that he was holding him but.
Like it wasn't like a main sort of thing.
This is like the main meal is like their.
Relationship but it's also empower.
Empowering story like she she needs to i.
Think she lives in a very lonely.
Solitude existence of a world and part.
Of her journey is to understand that.
There's a world outside of hers and.
That's why there was a chicano whole.
Chicano storyline that weaves through.
The story and and things that kind of.
Bring her out of her comfort zone and by.
The end you know i think she starts to.
Realize and learn how maybe she can live.
A healthier life but when this is come.
Out this comes out september 16 ola in.
November 6 in la and then new york you.
Said new york the next weekend and then.
Other it'll be in san francisco seattle.
Like it'll be in most major cities ok.
Yeah it's called miss purple yeah and i.
Was curious as to a your writing process.
And how you get into that because the.
Whole brother-sister relationship like.
You're obviously drawing from that.
Experience and uh maybe like with kuk.
And stuff if you want to talk about that.
Because uh it shows like different.
Ingress intricacies i think it was.
During the the riots right yeah it's.
Takes place during that 90 to la riots.
Yeah and then your next one is with kind.
Of like deportation and i'm not sure if.
You have any actual experience with it.
But maybe like you can kind of take us.
Through this story of all three yeah.
Well you know i think i have a there's a.
Reason or purpose for the art that i.
Make i mean i feel like most people on.
The internet know me to be an idiot but.
I think it is it you know as a filmmaker.
I i i my purpose really solely is to.
There's a few thing.
Actually the first and foremost is i am.
Trying to bring empathy to our community.
As asian americans so like if somebody.
That's outside of our community watches.
A film they maybe understand how we.
Operator or can can empathize for us a.
Little bit more so that's a first.
Criteria second criteria is you know we.
Have crazy rich asians black panther and.
And all these sort of uh you know miss.
Bala these films that are strictly you.
Know cast and include people of that.
Ethnicity which is great but i'm also.
Interested in my art exploring how we.
Coexist and interconnect and all that.
Stuff so those are two things that that.
That drive me in terms of what i want to.
Say is for the writing process you know.
Everything i do has to be it needs to be.
Coming from a very personal place the.
One i'm about to do i read a few news.
Articles about people who were getting.
Deported and just really i just every.
Time i read a story like that i would.
Start crying like crazy because it's.
Really sad and it's like some of these.
People have to leave their families.
Behind and you know me being like a new.
Dad and having a one and a half year old.
Like i couldn't even imagine that and.
Also like just for somebody like that to.
Be abandoned by the parents and given up.
For adoption and then a lot of these.
People go through the foster care system.
Because even their adopted parents.
Sometimes don't want them and then you.
Know fast forward like two decades.
Finding out that the us the place you.
Could call home doesn't want you and is.
Kicking you out i think that's a very.
It's like it's like getting pretty much.
Kicked in the ass yeah your whole life.
Yeah it's pretty my heart goes out to.
Them so like you know giving a platform.
To a community that doesn't have a voice.
I think is a worthwhile endeavor so you.
Know that those are some reasons why i.
Make the art that i do and and and you.
Know i want to be like sort of the.
Counter-programming we have like the.
Justin lin's and the james wands and and.
You know john choose and and they're.
Doing amazing working they're really.
Great in that studio of like big-time.
Studio system i think i'm really great.
At drama and you know and i in comedy.
And stuff but like much more intimate in.
Real kind of stories so i'm like the.
Counter-programming to that and i think.
I i just make a nice balance i think.
It's really interesting that you um i.
Mean a lot of people say that right a.
Lot of artists will say i'm all about.
Like the art and not anything else not.
Like the fame not i just want to make.
Art yeah but you were presented with.
Some huge opportunities to work with.
Like hundred like really really finance.
Films like big studios you you were i.
Mean you were offered basically you.
Could have went that route yeah you.
Could have went the route of b being the.
Next director of a marvel film or.
Something but instead you chose i mean.
That doesn't appeal to you well money.
Doesn't drive me that's the biggest.
Thing is is uh i've seen what money like.
In fame and all that i've seen people.
Have it right and we all know that that.
Doesn't make you happy i mean it's not.
It can't you can be happy with money and.
Fame if you're sort of internal.
Compasses right but if it's just that's.
The only thing you're looking for you're.
Gonna find yourself very very empty.
So money doesn't drive me it's i think.
Money is a great sort of indicator if.
You're doing great work there's a money.
I think follows talent right so i don't.
Focus on that.
I don't focus on the biggest opportunity.
Or the biggest career move i fee i focus.
On what feels right to me and and.
Artistically and and spiritually and you.
Know um what makes sense for my family i.
Think if you do one of those huge movies.
You won't see your family for like three.
Years you're like constantly working and.
And you're having to answer someone.
That's the other thing that i really.
Really value is autonomy like i really.
Value being the master of my own life.
Mm-hmm and not having to answer to like.
People telling me what i have to do or.
How i need to do it so.
With art so i value that so like you.
Know those kind of opportunities i'm.
Very flattered but as of right now i.
Think there's a there's a lot of work to.
Be done that i feel is important that i.
Need to do first i'm not saying i'll.
Never do it you know like yeah be really.
Fun to do like a big million yeah a.
Hundred million dollar movie but you.
Know my my babies like really young and.
I don't miss out babies like really my.
Babies like little a baby hahaha.
My baby's a baby and i never get that.
Time back with her yeah so you know i.
Work from home like i do like my editor.
Reynolds who's also from hawaii reynolds.
Barney and uh his name is actual.
Reynolds barney roasting here i know i.
Love him though but like he's over at my.
House we're editing in uh in my office.
And like i do that purpose and i and i.
Stay home as much as i can to be with my.
Baby but if i was doing studio film.
I really doubt they're gonna let me edit.
From my home and of course yeah so.
They're gonna make me edit from the edit.
Bay they're gonna come in and out to.
Look at the progress and everything and.
But uh you know i do that so i can.
Astronaut like for now at least you know.
When when my kid doesn't want me around.
Then maybe yeah that's maybe when i'll.
Go do like a bigger film and just bounce.
And and do that whole thing but right.
Now i think like there are some stories.
That i think can change people's opinion.
You know in a different way and i tell.
Stories about people who aren't the.
Point zero one percent you know like my.
Stories aren't really like fantastical.
They're like a realistic look at our.
Lives you know like it's a lot of my.
Films are about the working-class you.
Know they're not about like super rich.
People they're they're just about like.
Normal people like us you know and and i.
Also think that's valuable yeah well.
With that being said we'll come back and.
We'll talk about another film that we.
Had in mind yeah yeah but before we get.
There we have to take a quick shishi.
Break and we are out.
Music.
And we're back and we're back back gtfo.
Gtfo that's um so what were we talking.
About our new upcoming yes oh you were.
Talking about how you like do more real.
Things mm-hmm and never me and justin.
Caught with ideas because it's usually.
Stemming from me it's really dumb like.
Really.
We have really dumb eyes but i like that.
Too yeah it's a it's it's a nice break.
Right yeah you've got to have your meal.
But you also have to have your dessert.
Yeah i think that's something that i.
Really like about you is that you don't.
Try to like you know get stuck in like.
One cubicle like you have a lot of.
Different facets to in one cube yeah.
Yeah you have many different phases to.
Your keep allotted little cubes yeah.
You're really you're cute.
Cube he yep.
But know that i think that's what's.
Really cool about you is that you know.
There's so many different sides to you.
That there are some people who are gonna.
Be like i don't think justin's are.
Dumbass like he's really serious you.
Know i really like dose types of people.
Thanks.thanks yeah i don't like you but.
It's okay no thanks yeah i mean i think.
About i take it all back man no yeah.
Thanks man no iii think like i think man.
I just i just want to live a full life.
Mm-hmm you know and i think it's life is.
There's too many things experience them.
To just be one thing you know and i feel.
Like that's what you guys are doing like.
With this podcast and right you guys try.
Not new stuff and like you could just be.
Doing the same old but like yeah there's.
Too much cool stuff to do that to just.
Be like the serious guy or the funny guy.
Or that's why i love when i see you know.
Comedians do like dramas and stuff yeah.
I love like when jim carrey did the.
Truman show or eternal sunshine you know.
And i also like when when.
Really serious guys that do like stupid.
Comedies like when matt damon did that.
One film with greg kinnear i think it's.
Stuck on you where they play siamese.
Like stuff like that you know i love.
When they do stuff like that but i think.
That um i think there's so many ways we.
Can like express ourselves why limited.
To just yeah the same old boring.
So let's talk about how you you.
Guys are gonna explore yourself in this.
New dumb idea that you have this dumb.
Idea um i mean it's been a long time.
Like still saying we're gonna do it but.
We just never do it but we are trying to.
Write a bg a movie for people who i.
Don't know if you don't know what that.
Is it's just our fake kpop band that we.
Had started off as one video a joke.
And it just ended like really well it.
Did a huge international reach yeah it.
It i remember the first one because it's.
Literally singing dongs idea which means.
I have to take a    right yeah yeah.
I died initially is just me and david.
Right we just i recorded it's just my.
Voice really and then we're like okay.
Well we need a band and i was like okay.
What asians do i know that can be a part.
Is obviously justin's one right because.
I know he can sing too if we i mean we.
Didn't you didn't really need to sing.
But and then i got feel because i know.
He likes to dance and then jun i kind of.
Just met but i knew he was into kpop.
Yeah it was just super helpful to have.
Him he's like the identity of kpop yes.
He's literate like beep that's his life.
He literally is doing still like on his.
By himself he's doing like carried on.
With bj by himself he's literally like.
The last video was about him leaving the.
Group and start doing it because he's.
The star yeah and and he's it's.
Happening yeah it's real life you know.
Actually i've gone to some general.
Meetings with like some studio people.
Yeah and they bring it up they break up.
Beat you here yeah they go like so hey.
What is this dude yeah some like a few.
Particular we're like hey so thomas it's.
Like what is this bga thing and i starts.
Are laughing why did you watch that.
Because these are like old white men you.
Know and i'm like wow.
Why though it cuz they do they have kids.
Is that i don't know oh i didn't ask i.
Was just typing justin chon yeah but.
Then they love it they're just like no.
It's like so fun and they love it but um.
But i think we also like that's that's.
Something that you did was sort of like.
With the whole youtube you bridge use.
Help bridge the gap because it started.
Off such a little thing and you you and.
Some other people like really blew it up.
Into something that's like more now it's.
Mainstream like youtube is not like it's.
Not a niche thing it's more actually.
More big than we were talking about that.
Like tv shows or whatever it is so the.
Point of where networks are adapting to.
Like kind of the youtube formula.
Ya know it's all about streaming and.
Videos on demand yeah so i feel like.
It's just as legitimate you know i.
Remember i will actually be on twilight.
Explaining to them i was like yeah i'm.
Doing this youtube thing and they're.
Like why would you do that why would you.
Waste your time yeah and i was like no.
No no you don't understand like this can.
Be you know reach a lot of people and.
It's it's the new thing that's that i.
Feel it's gonna be huge and and i end.
You know watching how you guys were.
Operating i don't think they were seeing.
That yet and everybody was catching up.
But now it's it's it's legitimate more.
Legitimate than anything you know but um.
I don't mind i don't mind doing some vga.
Yeah.
Yeah well we were working on another so.
We have another song that still needs to.
Be we wrote it out david and i and and.
It needs to be recorded still i do you.
Guys have auditions.
Um rappers like you need a filipino.
Rapper and it would have to fit this.
Storyline oh you don't need anybody who.
Was it that keeps asking me like there's.
It was funny cuz like like i said it was.
So casual the way i was like hs and you.
Want to do this like kpop video yeah it.
Wasn't gonna be a big deal similar like.
Filling them i was just like but then.
Like people like man why like why don't.
You pick me like other like asian.
Friends i have yeah like jealous it like.
Like even like wes i think wanted to do.
It at some point i don't know if you.
Actually want to he sit like here's just.
Like why did you ya ask me.
Yeah or like anyways would've been good.
Yeah he looks very like he has that look.
Too yeah you know where sis like slick.
Undercover sort of like sexy yeah you.
Know like i could see how like.
Mysterious yet mysterious west from.
Waffle production yeah yeah what he's.
The one that the girls like right from.
Wrong he's like the mysterious quiet one.
But like he has style and like and.
You're kind of like oh style but he also.
Seems like a guy that would take care of.
His girlfriend yeah really nice dude.
Yeah i like but that is also like has.
Like them brooding like like male sort.
Of like energy but then also sensitive.
Yeah and then we have phil shotsfired.
Combo well i mean speaking if there's.
Any bga fans watching they're gonna be.
Shocked cuz i mean if they only know you.
From bga yeah like you said they.
Probably think you're an idiot and i'm.
Sure they probably think you're an asset.
Like you hate like you really do hate.
Jun yeah and we've got to keep that.
Going my god you really does hate you.
June yeah that down but that in the.
Calculation one of the twitter questions.
Is from tuned do you remember me tell.
Him tell him he should go watch a.
Picture telling him right now oh hey.
June you should watch pixar's coco i.
Don't remember you who are like what is.
What's his name username june curry on.
So june like why the    do you have.
Curry in your name like what is that.
About.
I don't know why he wants to be like.
Korean that's why oh curry on    beach.
Is a real thing guys we're not playing.
Characters it's written so that they're.
All very exaggerated versions of.
Ourselves david david's question to you.
Is are you secretly in love with june.
Curry on a man sexuality it should be.
Fluid.
So i i'm not i wouldn't be ashamed of.
Robin this is going you know that space.
Between the ball that's why you want to.
Pull his hair but i know i think i come.
From a place he comes from uh straight.
Yeah i think i sexual frustration yeah.
Funny the hall that natural like that.
Relation like the first script you.
Weren't really i'm trying to remember.
How it started you weren't we weren't.
Mean - you weren't mean to june yeah i.
Think it's a sieve all just happened.
Like on sarah.
Yeah like it just became an ongoing you.
Know what i think it was so i think it's.
Because he was like the the slave driver.
We had to learn that stupid dance the.
First the first video and i we like.
Actually had to rehearse yeah yeah and.
I'm like i'm like learning from this.
This guy i don't even know like i met.
Him through vga and i'm like why are you.
Telling me what to do man and i think.
That it's like that secret frustration.
Evolved from that mmm-hmm and that was.
Like oh but he's kind of cute but why.
Tell me what to do i felt bad for june a.
Lot because we are all so bad and like.
Not really taking the dance part.
Seriously and he was so serious about it.
Yeah yeah yeah i mean i told him from.
The start like um cuz he choreographed.
The first one and then he had a friend.
Helping us with the second one and i was.
Like i saw the second i was like dude.
This is too hard man like but i gotta.
Say the dancing and the first one's way.
Better mm-hmm.
It was actually easier yeah it was.
Easier but look did you notice how much.
We cut out of the dancing on yeah yeah.
But the dance our dancing was better in.
The first one mm-hmm.
Yeah second one was barely even dancing.
Boobies were so lazy were like nah man.
Is they just cut a lot and a lot of it.
Was just us like messing around like.
Your that shot that was all like yeah.
That was the other thing jun directed.
The second one yeah and he was really he.
Was really making me frustrated.
Also his directing style man because he.
Just takes too long with everything i'm.
Like hurry.
Part of the story lines like june comes.
Back he's like i've heard your podcast.
Like i've heard your i heard the punk.
And you know i super deep dude right my.
Name is june curry on and i have her i.
Mean i i don't actually i don't want.
Your video to get d monetize i was i'm.
Gonna stop yes too late but no no no but.
You know he's very talented.
Yes very talented he you know he did a.
Great job with that music it looked.
Really great and he's a he's a good.
Dancer is a good is amazing violinist.
Yeah his his his skills on the strings.
Is like uncanny just a really amazing on.
That violin but that you know you know i.
Violin the bow is made of horse horse.
Tail really so he's really good like.
He's connected to animals and yeah and.
Connected to the earth yeah so uh he's.
Really good with the wood in his neck.
Yeah we gotta get jun on the podcast but.
Then bring justin back and not and not.
Tell june yeah justin will just be there.
Yeah do this no no no you know you know.
What needs to happen is you need to set.
Him up like make him to get real.
Comfortable and then start having them.
Kind of like talk a little bit of.
Yeah and then i should be like i show up.
In the door with like headphones on and.
Be like i've been listening to you i.
Don't think is so nice i don't think he.
Would hit talk to you even if like you'd.
Be like oh yeah yeah justin sometimes.
Said some things to me yeah i think i.
Don't think jun would would do that yeah.
Yeah it's funny how that just it just.
Became a thing it became it became a.
Thing and it's people's favourite.
Relationship it's either you love the.
The love-hate relationship between you.
And jun or you just love david for being.
David yeah david's funny too in it yeah.
We we hope to continue it on in a in.
Movie form at some point but what i want.
To talk about right now is paco stand-up.
Career know.
Yeah i want to get i want to talk i want.
To talk about.
Paco's stand-up comedy career we for the.
Viewers at home paco and ryan were in la.
Further apart there they're doing the.
Podcast in la and the plans yeah and we.
Went out for some drinks and then we.
Came back and we forced paco to do a.
Stand-up stand-up act for us and we all.
Like critiqued him let's preface this.
Like paco never let me i would say like.
Yeah oh he's like i'm gonna do an open.
Mic and like he would never tell me.
Where it was yeah i was like dude you.
Need critics that like you need people.
To tell you like when it's not good and.
Also for sure yeah also we need to.
Preface that we know nothing about.
Stand-up comedy or we are like our.
Opinions are valid in any way we just.
Wanted to like give honest feedback of.
How like it's just normal people yeah.
Like if we like it or not that's all.
Like and another thing that i would put.
In is that you guys come from a.
Standpoint of like storytelling no like.
You guys do really well at storytelling.
So in that aspect because my jokes.
Aren't just like oh these are one-liners.
You know where it does come from a place.
Of oh there's some reality to this so.
That's why i was like you know i do feel.
Comfortable but also because i really do.
Look up to you yeah but we were just we.
Just wanted to we just wanted to get a.
Little taste.
Yeah of the paco jim and after i did my.
Set they destroyed me for like a good 30.
Minutes but i that's why i respect you.
More now because you you really took in.
Stride you didn't let it like you know.
Be personal and and you know that's hard.
To do like it's hard to take criticism.
You know we were too but we're just.
Speaking from like a non professional.
Stamp or just how we took it yeah yeah.
But uh but uh you know i think that.
Right now paco should do it well i mean.
I think i think how this could be.
Relative to a lot of people is that yeah.
I mean i think people need to loop if.
You're gonna try and do something you.
Have to like commit to it and then be.
Open to the criticism i think yeah i.
Think it's really tough to do no but.
There's a reason why and you understand.
Why i didn't want you guys like i'm okay.
With performing at open mics and like.
Bars coffee shop some people i have no.
Idea who they are you know because that.
Like in the end when i do stand-up.
Comedy it's gonna be for people like.
That.
Starting off it's gonna be for people.
Who have no idea or who i am with you.
Guys it's a lot more personal because of.
The relationship that we have like the.
Audience is seen justin will    on me.
All day and i'm cool with it and it's.
Fun and then ryan will do that too and.
I'm cool with it too but when it comes.
Like oh this is something that you know.
I'm trying to work on this graph and.
Stand up enough and then to have like to.
Think oh are they just gonna    on.
That too.
You know yeah yeah i see what you mean i.
See um so that's why i was very much so.
Like auto iii would only want to invite.
You and only have you there when i get.
To a point like i'm comfortable i work.
On this hundreds of times you know i.
Made this set good enough for i'm.
Confident that i can get you to laugh.
Yeah yeah well you feel proud yeah yeah.
But in the meantime tonight i think you.
Have to you know when people come over.
To ryan's house i think you know just.
The people know people are coming over.
To my house i think you know i would say.
I respect that that you took criticism.
Very well yeah and i think that's that's.
Important for a lot of people it's it's.
Tough man in any zone.
Especially if it's your job yeah you.
Know if you just work and something you.
Take pride in something you love and.
Someone comes and criticizes you i mean.
It comes from a place of us trying to.
Help right yeah yeah but even then.
That's tough man but that's a path to.
Progress that's a path to mastery ax is.
You have to you know be open to not.
Being awesome you know and at least i.
Can speak for myself is like i know like.
I'm like a novice and just starting out.
As a director and writer all that stuff.
And i need to i need to always be open.
And get wrekt all the time the more.
Times i get wrecked the better i'll get.
Because if i learn from it.
What's some negative criticism you've.
Got in for like    like.
Specifically you know someone review.
Said like you know it was kind of messy.
And but if you but they also talked.
About like you know you could tell there.
Was a raw artists passion behind it.
That that it kind of makes up for it but.
But i have to admit yeah there's parts.
That are pretty rough and the way i shot.
It was super.
Low budget and and scrappy so like i.
Don't have time or or you know the.
Resources to make it super polished but.
I look at it now and and taking that.
Sort of note from the reviews and and.
You know i generally don't read the.
Reviews it's more like you know asked.
Like peers you know when especially when.
I'm when i'm editing and i'm getting to.
Stage where it's getting kind of close.
To locking the the film so i could send.
It off to like sound and color and all.
That stuff.
I'll have we'll work on it and then at.
Night i'll always have at least one.
Screening and i'll i now invite the the.
Scariest people that i that i admire or.
Whatever and i'll have them watching and.
Give me notes and sometimes it's really.
I'm like you know and and a lot of times.
Are right and and always it always it's.
Always a note behind the note so they.
Might say like this section just doesn't.
It's kind of just like bad it sucks and.
Then it's like i have to really go back.
And then be like okay instead of being.
Like    you you don't know what you're.
Talking about just really think about it.
And get the note behind the note and.
Maybe it's he's saying it just felt slow.
Or or maybe the editing wasn't crisp.
Enough and it wasn't engaging enough and.
Or like maybe he's saying it was bad.
Because he wasn't clear on the the the.
Protagonist sort of how they were.
Feeling in the moment and that's.
Something i have to decipher afterward.
But like for me to be like he doesn't.
Know what he thought like that part's.
Not bad like it's sometimes people their.
Notes aren't you know because they're.
Talking in the moment they haven't had.
Time to process for a long time what.
They're saying so that's like an example.
You know and that has you know when i'm.
In the editing phase i'm constantly and.
Then you know and then sometimes like.
You also but here's the other thing paco.
Is like sometimes you also have to stick.
To your guns sometimes you go no that's.
Just my style or that's how i express.
Myself you have to know when something.
Is you know very sort of integral to who.
You are and in some stuff that's just.
More of a practical technical thing that.
You need to improve upon you know so.
Like people.
Were ragging on sort of some of my music.
Choices in that saying it was to all.
Over the place but i like that because.
I'm not one thing and they're like well.
There's too many tonal shifts in my.
Films and i'm like frankly i don't give.
A    about that specific thing that.
They're talking about and that's.
Something that i i want to hold on to.
But yeah i don't know what kind of.
Wrapping it up cuz time is uh but i just.
Wanted to throw in one more twitter.
Question because you are actually the.
First father guest oh yeah we haven't.
Had any guests that has ever thought.
About even had kids.
Except for your mom yes yeah but so.
Because you are kind of seen it again as.
A crazy person you know you're doing so.
Many things um how is it has having a.
Kid like changed your view on a lot of.
Things or even life yeah it has that's.
The the simple answer but um i think.
Having a kid can go two ways you can.
Just live your life and kind of be.
Irresponsible or if forces you be really.
You know we're talking my self-aware and.
Introspective it forces you to examine.
Who you are as a human because now you.
Have this child that's coming to the.
World and and you have to you know you.
Have to determine who you're gonna be.
And who the person that they're gonna.
Call dad and so it's made me have to.
Take a second look at the type of art.
That i'm making right so if you notice.
The art that i'm making is i mean.
Speaking of which like how are you gonna.
Explain to her bg hey yeah but you know.
That's you know it's it's fun though you.
Know yeah it's fun but like in terms of.
You know feature films they all have a.
Purpose and and i can stand confidently.
And it would on two feet in front of her.
And say yeah i did that for this reason.
I was trying to give these people a.
Voice and then sometimes it's okay to be.
Like i really truly believe that.
Sometimes the answer can be like we.
Needed money mm-hmm we everybody needs.
Money to survive so i needed to take.
That job because we our family needed.
The money.
But um it really but at the same time.
I've become kinder i've become more.
Compassionate i become more sympathetic.
And empathetic towards people i'm not.
Quick to judge i try not to be i try not.
To be as judgmental because all that.
Sort of and also i try not to speak.
Really negatively about other people.
Like it's all changed when you had a.
Baby yeah yeah yeah well it's not.
Overnight but cle is is true then that.
Does change you once you have a kid yeah.
But it's your own personal decision if.
You want to change or not um but you.
Know i don't want to bring em hmm.
You know i think you've seen me change.
Over the years.
Yeah we're talking last night and i.
Think before i was a much more.
Aggressive and you know i look at myself.
Now.
And i think i i'm not as aggressive in.
The sense that i somebody's like i'm not.
Used before i'd be like oh yeah screw.
That guy you know if that guy hey doug i.
Don't do that as much because i don't.
Want to bring that energy home and i.
Think that's what the baby does and in.
Terms of work some people go in the.
Direction of like i need to make more.
Money to give my kid what they need and.
Then there's the other option which is.
Like no no all that stuff doesn't matter.
I think what's more important is helping.
Molding her to be somebody that you.
Think will be a great member of society.
What's more important is well yeah you.
Can either try and make more money too.
To try to give your kids what you think.
They need and then but that my.
Philosophy is to spend more time with.
Them and try to you know give them a.
Strong foundation you can't make your.
Kid become anything they're gonna be who.
They're gonna be and i only my job is to.
Kind of give them the tools or what i.
Think is is productive and constructive.
For them to go out in the world and it's.
On them but but i think that's what.
Having a kid does it really makes you.
Think about even who you are and you be.
Just become you have to become more.
Selfless because a kid.
They can't care for themselves you have.
To care for them so in that way i think.
I've become it's less i become less.
Egotistical you know i think being a.
Creative and an actor is that one of the.
Most narcissistic endeavors the one can.
Take on because you're just thinking.
Constantly about yourself and how you.
Come across and and having a kid really.
Takes you outside of that and it's less.
About like your own sort of hang-ups and.
Ego which i think is a beautiful thing.
So you guys should have kids yeah so i.
Guess when i go pick one up or we can do.
One together.
Music.
Laughter.
Okay well i mean that's that's a good.
Way to end off of us so paco and i are.
Gonna go get kids yeah again just to.
Wrap up justin your film is purple comes.
Out when september 6 at the newark in.
Santa monica it'll expand to other.
Theaters in los angeles and in.

You know netflix is pretty messed up.
They do something i'm not gonna go there.
They do something that's called a pan.

Which is like yeah what they do is a pan.
Scan they just they pan and scan it and.
They scan it and they cut off the ends.

Ends and they decide when to pan to each.
