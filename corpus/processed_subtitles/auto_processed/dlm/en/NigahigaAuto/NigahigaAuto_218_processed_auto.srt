Dear ryan can you do a ping pong trick.
Shot you actually think we're gonna do.

So i know you must be a little confused.
Now because of the title you know saying.
That they were fails when clearly you.
Know her don't know why i'm talking like.
This well you see ever since we did our.
First trickshot video we've been getting.
A lot of crazy requests to do a bunch of.
Other ones some are repeats clearly they.
Haven't seen that we already did those.
And there's also some crazy ones like.
These like throwing knives and and bow.
And arrow trick shots dangerous ones.
Well the reason why i pick ping-pong.
Balls over all the other great options.
Is because you know i learned my lesson.
From the other ones we broke a lot of.
Things and people did get hurt and.
That's why i picked ping-pong balls.
Because they're safe and they're light.
And you know they're nothing's gonna get.
Broken from a little light ping-pong.
Ball is what i told myself before we.
Started doing this.
Applause.
