Hey guys so i don't know if it's just me.
But i feel like lately a lot of people.
Have been a lot ruder to other people.
Than they have been in the past ruder.
Ruder i'm rude but he's ruder ruder what.
Why does that sound so weird little.
Spellcheck ruder nope no squiggly red.
Line so it must be a real word don't act.
Like you guys don't do that but anyway.
Kind of notice that people in general.
Seem to be getting ruder more rude earth.
I feel like growing up i didn't win this.
Nearly as many room people as i do now.
Then again i did grow up in hawaii and.
If you're rude there most the time you.
Just get beat up i mean i guess beating.
Up people is a little rude too but i'm.
Off top anyway i feel like the world is.
Becoming more and more hateful and.
Negative place lately for example i was.
At the coffee shop the other day and i.
Witnessed a guy who slipped and kind of.
Spilled some coffee and another guy who.
Reacted pretty ruefully problem row yes.
If someone spills anything on you it's.
Pretty upsetting but you don't have to.
Go and curse them on and then another.
Day i was at the gym it was actually a.
While back because i was at the gym.
Clearly you know i don't even lift bro i.
Was walking by these two fairly.
Attractive girls and being the nosy.
Person that i am i was kind of.
Eavesdropping on their conversation.
Basically they were talking about.
Another girl that they were looking at.
That was on a treadmill do you see what.
She's wearing you do not come in do it.
Mmm she ever heard of shaving and then.
Most recently which pretty much inspired.
Me to make this video i had to go to a.
Place where there's nothing but built-up.
Anger frustration and just all-around.
Rudeness and hate throughout the entire.
Facility next i said next if you're a.
Driver you know exactly what i'm talking.
About but you get the point i mean i get.
It everyone has bad days including.
Myself i mean i'm not gonna lie.
Sometimes i do feel like pushing back.
The guy who bumped into me on a crowded.
Street or yelling at a waitress who.
Brought me the wrong order after making.
Me wait an hour or even flipping off a.
Guy who cut me off in traffic but then i.
Think of a motto that i kind of made up.
And it's helped me be a much more.
Friendly and positive person we all know.
All the generic sayings we heard growing.
Up you nicer to others or tree people.
You want to be treated those sayings are.
So vague and overused at the moment.
Something bad happens or we're having a.
Bad day we just completely forget about.
Which is why i created a new campaign.
That is even more straightforward and.
Hopefully a little less forgettable they.
Treat people like they're dying can be.
No it might sound a little negative but.
It's the complete opposite if everybody.
Treated each other as if they were dying.
People would be friendlier and more.
Forgiving for example if he knew a guy.
Was dying and he accidentally spilled.
Coffee on you i guarantee that you would.
Not yell at him and you would not curse.
Him i seriously don't worry about it.
It's just a shirt most people would not.
Yell at a guy who's sorry the world.
Would have less mean girls because no.
One talks crap behind a dying person's.
Back she's so inspirational seriously.
She's so brave in general people would.
Just be nicer to each other hi so sorry.
To keep you waiting look i do for you.
But not only will people be nicer to.
Each other when people realize that.
They're dying a lot of times that's when.
People live life to its fullest no.
Longer will people have to put up all.
The things they wanted to do in life no.
Longer where people have to wait to.
Their father's deathbed to hear the.
Words i've always been my son no longer.
When people wait to chase after the real.
Dreams some people may know their.
Expiration date and some don't but in.
Reality we're all dying right now.
Because none of us live forever every.
Second of every day we're one step.
Closer to death and i think it's about.
Time we started treating each other like.
It so the next time someone does.
Something bad or upsetting to you and.
You feel like responding negatively just.
Remember if you want to make this world.
A better place.
Spread the positivity treat people like.
Their died.
Hell that was so bad that was so cheesy.
This entire video is so dying.
Inspirational i wish i had that kind of.
Courage so thank you guys again so much.
For watching if you want to see bloopers.

The left if you want to see the previous.
Video click the one on the right and if.
You want to order your very own i'm.
Dying shirt well then you're in luck.
Because there is none and we kind of.
Made it up you got it from target and we.
Just turned it inside out and we made.
Our own thing good but target what.
