Good for you and we're very much like.
Now let's stay home watch a movie or.
Whatever or just let's just work all day.
Well to be fair you can do that in vegas.
As well yes you can you can that's true.
You might you do this trip so if you.
Want to do fun stuff yeah i mean people.
Don't realize all the times but like.
Vegas is here vegas you picture the.
Strip but where we are where you guys.
Are.
Yeah you know but the majority of vegas.
Is not the strip right very chill yeah i.
People have been like wait people live.
In las vegas i know it's like yeah yeah.
And i'm trying to i'm still trying to.
Sell them what is your page what is your.
Page to try and bring i should just put.
The dm know just alright i'll recap the.
Deal okay what i remember is there you.
Go.
Real number one real estate prices.
Incredibly good you get a great house.
For a good price number two taxes state.
Has zero percent income tax compared to.
California top end is 13.3% so you're.
Saving a lot of money see when you say.
Numbers like that it's not so much but i.
Wouldn't have said that there's a point.
Something percent i know i didn't put.
That in the details ero is better than.
Anything else and and no traffic yep.
No well well except for on the strip and.
When we get the readers sunday's might.
Be okay but we are getting the raiders.
Oh getting our own nfl team we have a.
Hockey team that was in the stanley cup.
Yeah we and that's big in minnesota.
Yes hockey i think also uh now we have a.
Wnba team really do okay and then i.
Think we also have a baseball team i.
Don't i don't think they're in the.
Majors though it's uh i know what fields.
Being built yeah where's it being bill i.
Think i think it might be done okay.
I could be wrong i've been hearing about.
This this las vegas getting a basketball.
Team for years though and i think that's.
Gonna be huge when that happens if it.
Happens but we were supposed to get the.
Kings sacramento kings but we never did.
But hopefully we get an expansion team.
Like the go tonight.
And that might be quite you into any.
Other sports or you know i.
Yeah i did play basketball in like early.
High school but now you know ryan has.
Invited me to basketball once or twice.
Yeah cuz you're like seven foot eight.
Yeah you true like i'm pretty rusty i'm.
Kind of nervous to play good so i look.
You're being like if you played in high.
School like i did we didn't play in high.
School.
Okay and we play in that league yeah so.
Just based on fundamentals and your.
Height yeah you would probably be mvp.
All right all the stuff that you do in.
Your videos like it's a lot of like no.
Anyway let's talk more about cuz let's.
Get back into you you know we wanna know.
More about you yeah so you live in vegas.
Tell us about vegas i'm just go ahead go.
Ahead but uh like with your content it's.
A little bit more like kids content and.
You have to gear it towards a younger.
Audience but with the guidelines that.
Youtube has and because your stuff is a.
Lot of like fighting hackers and there's.
A lot of like not weapons but gadgets.
Gadgets you can't say weapon don't say.
Weapon you've had to adjust accordingly.
So maybe you want to discuss the.
Transition you know since the youtube.
Algorithm is changed over these years.
Yeah good question yeah it just keeps.
Changing and if you don't keep up you're.
In trouble yeah we've definitely like.
When we first started on youtube back in.
2010 we were doing a lot of parodies.
Growing up i thought i was gonna be a.
Famous musician and that was my plan.
That's my goal.
Played guitar and piano and all that.
Stuff and was in bands all through high.
School and all that and youtube was kind.
Of my creative outlet for doing music so.
I was doing parodies i loved weird al.
Yankovic yeah man so we used to do a lot.
Of parodies it was they were very like.
Kind of adult ish a little bit no.
Swearing or anything but very like.
Saturday night live humour and just we.
Did that for many years never really.
Went crazy actually well the videos.
Would get like you know a million views.
Sometimes two million views but never.
Really built a huge fan base because i.
Think that style of content it's very.
Like you're in the mirror yet you're.
There for the video not for the.
Personality essentially yeah and so we.
Moved we eventually moved to los angeles.
Once we hit like a hundred thousand.
Subscribers let's just give this a shot.
We're not we're not really making any.
Money but if we did this full-time let's.
Let's just see what.
Bin's at the time v was running she.
Owned her own curves fitness center for.
Women she sold it i co-owned a software.
Company still do so but i retired from.
The day to day work on that and my.
Partner's took over the kind of.
Operations of that i came out here he.
Came out here and we just kind of.
Started experimenting with different.
Types of content we did some roasts of.
Youtubers i roasted ryan that's one of.
The first ones i seen yeah i liked it.
And i was annoyed too right yes yeah bob.
Juice yeah for sure.
Those were fun did that for a while i.
Just kept experimenting.
It was very influenced and inspired by.
Mathias in fact i think i think you you.
Remember mathias he was on it yeah yeah.
I always said from the when the moment i.
Saw him was like i was telling him to.
Cuz he was on the same season oh cool.
And i was like this guy's gonna be yeah.
This guy well he one saw that this guy's.
Gonna be huge and it did yeah yeah so.
Yeah when we first moved to la he was.
The first person i had up at the time.
Yet we were at like a hundred thousand.
Subscribers he was at three hundred.
Thousand and i was like hey man you.
Wanna can i take you out to dinner and.
Just pick your brain talk youtube.
He was like yeah let's do it i thought.
That was really cool of him to do that.
And just became really good friends with.
Him and his wife and he always.
Encouraged me to experiment try.
Different things and he did - he used to.
Do parodies and songs in kept.
Experimenting till he found his niche so.
It was very inspired by that tried a lot.
Of different things and then i think.
Once we decided you know let's try i was.
Like let's do something that i would.
Love when i was like 10 years old right.
And from that thought process came you.
Know when i was 10 i loved the teenage.
Mutant ninja turtles so i'm gonna buy.
All the teenage mutant ninja turtles.
Ninja gadgets and test them out on fruit.
Chop them up and so doesn't all that me.
And that video did really well like well.
Let's do some more of this and so we did.
Like 5 video game weapons and we would.
Choose different video games in.
Different movies test them out that.
Series did really real great so that's.
Kind of really what started to blow us.
Up on youtube and kind of evolved from.
There and i've probably got off topic of.
Your question yeah like ryan could have.
Gone into that but the first time he.
Tried using weapons uh well i mean i.
And they've advanced too well yeah i.
Tried to cut through fruit as well oh.
Okay um but it was more for it was.
Actually a skit i wasn't actually trying.
To cut through it and it was recreating.
Fruit ninja in real life yeah yeah and.
Yeah i i tried to cut through a.
Watermelon and the watermelon hit the.
Sword the sword hit my nose and that's.
Why this scar here yeah and that was on.
Mythbusters cuz they were like talking.
About like was it fruit ninja i don't.
Know i didn't watch it wasn't yeah.
And what were they saying on mythbusters.
I don't even remember the episode but.
They were making fun of me.
Probably is like the 88 who like got cut.
By a sword because of a waterman trying.
To cut a watermelon and they're.
Especially like this guy's in asian and.
He doesn't even know how to use a weapon.
Even worse asian american definitely a.
Myth but he gotta be math i never i.
Would never.
I got a c but yeah so i mean continue.
Talking about you know you had to adapt.
To it.
Yeah these things so yeah i just kind of.
Kept adapting and we still do you know.
We still like pay very close attention.
To our analytics we're very yeah very.
Analytical we have a team of five people.
Who do our youtube videos with and i.
Guess i like to say we're probably the.
Most viewed youtubers that no one's ever.
Heard of we right now last 30 days we.
Got 250 million views that's crazy.
And yeah did your videos i mean i don't.
Always see them but when i see them and.
I go check out your channel it's like oh.
One day ago three minutes like cutie-pie.
Numbers in his prime yeah.
Not that he's not trying but it was like.
You know cuz you guys post often how.
Often i've right now five days a week.
Yeah like five days a week and then like.
Every videos like oh.
Million five million two million you.
Know it's pretty crazy yeah it's really.
Crazy and i'm surprised that like i mean.
Like you said like it's weird that you.
Get you're getting all this attention.
But it's like in the realm i guess of.
Like talking about bigger youtubers that.
Are blowing up right it's all about like.
Who's making the news like with the.
Drama news drama yeah so if you guys had.
Drama then then really holy crap these.
Guys have a lot of views right yeah for.
Sure yeah right so all you gotta do is.
Attack a famous youtuber with you ninja.
Gadgets you're in there someone who's.
Been on youtube for a really.
Long time what do you think now you got.
To go for somebody who's in the new yeah.
Not somebody here elephant's irrelevant.
Yeah you gotta go for somebody who's.
Like like like fighting yeah.
Oh she do a boxing match and then midway.
Do the boxing match bring out your.
Gadgets mm-hmm and then kill just get.
Disqualified.
It'll be demonetised but people will be.
Talking about that's true like that.
Crazy youtuber yeah gadgets yeah yeah so.
You know we're thinking like since you.
Are very analytical i mean i'm sure even.
Noticed the trends and those things.
Working obviously that's not your thing.
That's not our thing either so yeah yeah.
But what if we were to evolve it because.
It's always about thinking ahead right.
So what if we were to take that fighting.
This whole drama scene to the next level.
Right and what if it is ninja battles.
Ninja battles yeah ninja battle royale.
You tell me that would not be clickable.
With a bunch of youtube i mean you'd.
Have to get them to do it but i mean.
Come on already kind of did that they.
Did yeah well we are mr. beast did that.
Whole battle royale with a bunch of yeah.
But that would be even harder to film if.
You're gonna do it in darkness and at.
Night and then you have loud people.
Going welcome over there and you're.
Gonna go and dave mack them in the face.
It will do it mortal kombat style like.
Not necessarily in the night jury you.
Know you know arena.
Realm type things like little torches.
All over the place exactly for our for.
Our dudes like yeah with spikes with.
Spikes see now we're thinking tell me.
That would not be i mean granted we'd.
Have to i'm trying i'm really trying to.
Make a version of it but that's a lot of.
Paperwork that's a lot of paper well but.
Yeah that's the future though guys if.
You want that give this video a thumbs.
Up yeah and then you know what if you.
Know how to say uh i've never done this.
Before but i saw recently anthony did.
Like oh if it gets so many likes i would.
Do something yeah but his video reached.
That crazy amount of things i don't know.
What he has to do but it's something.
Ridiculous and i don't want to do that.
Oh okay it works so go to jail yeah yes.
Once like if he gets enough 40,000 like.
Yeah it was on a bts video so it's just.
We didn't think it's gonna get that many.
It did i said puck was going to jail so.
He's still has to go to jail i have to.
Run a tank through a house because of.
Thumbs up maybe we haven't done that yet.
Actual attain a real tank so what one of.
My favorite videos we've ever done was.
We went to minnesota they have tanks you.
Can drive army tanks and we i actually.
In minnesota yeah i didn't know that i.
Mean it's minnesota they don't have much.
Else to do yeah exactly we just have.
Open fields and army tanks that's all we.
Have my job likings.
Yeah basketball football and hockey.
Right yes a lot of they're just not.
Having the best but yeah i rode i've.
Drove an army tank over two bands two.
Cars and crushed them.
That's really fun sounds like if this.
Video gets and it's just a number that.
Never hit if this video gets 192.
Thousand thumbs up i'll run this through.
A house any case the because the tank.
Place was like we have a special package.
It's only like eighty thousand dollars.
You can buy a trailer house type thing.
You could run the tank through it i was.
Like oh they offer it so maybe i'll i.
Didn't think whatever the return the.
Investment there is yeah i mean you're.
Getting into mr. b's territory now you.
Need to have a sponsor yeah that's.
That's pretty crazy yeah but i mean you.
Gotta do it yeah good yeah we're still.
Planning it we will do it sometime you.
Know for sure gotta do it yeah i'm gonna.
Go to jail eventually too right yeah.
It's either you are real reason for real.
Yeah it's just a matter of time a real.
Crime yeah so that's how we don't make.
Those bets anymore because we i don't.
Want to not do what we're supposed to be.
Doing yeah sh we're gonna be honest yeah.
Yeah so the trust of your audience is.
Everything when you're ready dude jail.
But giving back to your i guess your.
Regular life in a life um i'm curious.
Because you post so much i mean i know a.
Lot of youtubers do this but a lot of.
People also backup their content you you.
I mean you moved to vegas but you.
Haven't really gotten you were saying.
You haven't gotten to do much vegas.
Things cuz you're always working yeah.
Yeah so what's your schedule been like.
We've pretty much we start every day.
00 a.m. and we usually don't end.
00 p.m.
Like this past tuesday we went from 8.
A.m. to 10 p.m. i was a long filming day.
That's exhausting so yeah it's true.
We're trying to get more people right.
Now because i feel really bad for our.
Employees they're working their butts.
Off oh you guys are you guys here's our.
Hiring yeah yeah yeah yes you know.
Anybody good yeah got a little youtube.
Experience yeah a little bit of you.
Trust me i don't know anyone i don't.
Know anyone good here 12-hour day the.
Last time i worked a twelve-hour month.
I'm looking for someone real honest and.
Straightforward yeah so it's been it's.
Been pretty crazy for you guys and i.
Mean how many like obviously this this.
Whole schedule how long has this been.
Going on like this almost every day i.
Mean it's pretty much every day yeah.
Yeah every day you know we do kind of.
Take weekends off but you know v and i.
Still work a little bit though because.
Actually our employees do - they do.
Editing and stuff though the weekends.
Are kind of supposed to be off but like.
Memorial day we didn't even know it was.
A vacation wait like last minute oh.
Shoot it's holiday we text messaged.
Everybody like hey if you want to take.
The day off.
You can everyone came in anyway and just.
Worked a normal day yeah they're like we.
Know nobody else here yeah you're our.
Only friends that's true that's true.
We met one of them yeah one didn't you.
Guys melvin he plays basketball we're.
Still trying to convince we're just.
Trying to get him but i just asked.
Because i think that is i mean it's it's.
Commendable but do you think it's a.
Long-term thing because i feel like.
That's that sustained a burnt out for.
Sure that songs that sound mean it's.
Good because you're taking advantage of.
The situation yeah just you should yeah.
Yeah but that is that sounds like i mean.
Most i mean i don't think anyone can do.
That no i consistently that sounds.
Exhausting yeah it is for sure yeah.
We're we're trying to figure out how to.
How to get down to normal all right.
We'll get there yeah bring it on and.
Bringing on more people helps yes i hope.
So you know they'll be they'll be a.
Period where it probably has requires.
More work because yeah i trained them in.
But mm-hmm okay yeah cool unless you.
Unless you you know find someone who.
Already has some youtube experience and.
I would be horrible for your channel.
Yeah.
Yeah because i'm i like cuss a lot i'm.
Very not family-friendly yeah you would.
Hear the kids would not be people talk.
Trash in the comments about me i go at.
Them respond he's a responder iris first.
Responder he definitely responded.
Instead of giving first aid i just hurt.
Him more i make it worse so the parents.
Would be like you can't watch these.
Channels anymore yeah exactly yeah but.
News all in terms of all your i guess.
Going back to talking about your content.
And you know what you guys have been.
Producing it's a lot of it has to do.
With being hacked right or be all.
Hackers hackers is that is that like any.
True stories in terms of like have you.
Really been hacked in other i mean if.
You think about my own issues that's.
What also work you worked at a software.
Company right yeah i did yeah.
I mean it's legit thing so are you i've.
Actually if you look at my social blade.
You'll see a month where i had negative.
99 million views because i had so many.
Videos taken down.
Really those were copyright strikes but.
That's another story but yeah actually.
You might get this to you like every day.
I get like a google alert like did you.

Google password this was always people.
Trying to get youtube right it's crazy.
Yeah so actual hackers yeah actual.
Hackers you gotta watch out you guys.
Watch your back there's there in las.

Those issues i mean with not without.
Getting help from different yeah i.
Recently had a video that said please.

It is yeah and even if it's not true you.
Can get it you can fight it you'll win.
And they'll switch it but it takes time.
And all that time that that's happening.
Somebody else is benefiting yeah and.
That's the ridiculous part so i mean you.
Should it's kind of crazy to me that you.
Don't like there's not many other people.
There's a lot of youtubers to get views.
But not the same a trainer ship is you.
You know like i think that's kind of its.
Kind of ridiculous yeah sure you know i.
Used to have one uh-huh but usually they.
Pass you on to somebody else yeah that's.
What i heard but no yeah we didn't get.
Passed on that is very interesting to me.
Okay well you know what we will come.
Back after so i thought i saw hacker no.
I'm just kidding we'll be we'll be back.
We'll be back after this quick shishi.
Break to talk a little bit more and.
We're gonna get you a partner manager.
Right now i'm your partner manager now.
All right well that sucks to be you.
I hate taco bell that's my thing are we.
Filming right now yeah still clap.
Anywhere i love talk about yeah i was.
Trying to like get sponsored by taco.
Bell for quite a while i remember your.
Saying that house like smoothing with.
The bigwigs at a taco bell in fact but.
They they do know who i am and they have.
Invited me to many things mm-hmm they.
Invited me to the taco bell thanksgiving.
Dinner right where they invite like 30.
Youtubers and some other people it's.
Really cool cuz all all the like youtube.
Chefs are there mm-hmm.
That sounds kind of funny to say youtube.
Chef yeah but like these are like like.
Legit chefs you know and they're like.
Goal is to make a thanksgiving dinner.
But each item each like the turkey and.
The stuffing and all this has to use one.
Taco bell ingredient so like the for.
Example they had like the honey glazed.
Ham but instead of honey glazed it was.
Baja blast glaze wow it was so good it.
Was really good bob glasses dope it is.
My picture with turkey little ham ham.
Ham that changes everything difference a.
Big turkey it's two different things.
No no but i go to taco bell so much that.
So when i moved from minnesota to.
California the taco bell employee got me.
A going-away present no i'm gonna miss.
You so much.
Yeah yeah so i went there like every day.
Damn talk about yeah well i mean i i.
Tried to pitch a show up like i guess.
It's like a documentary it was it was.
Like based off of supersize me but it.
Was it was like taco bell but my goal.
Was to prove that and this is like five.
Years ago my goal was to prove that you.
Could eat talked about every day three.
Times a day yeah and still lose weight.
Yeah and i still and i still think i.
Could do it i think it's very possible.
I'm not trying to say and recently they.
Released an article that talked about.
One of the healthiest food fast food.
Chains wow um i feel really good about.
What well i did they also put a.
Disclaimer and say it doesn't mean it's.
Healthy it's the healthiest yes fast.
Gene or one of the healthiest pearboys.
Yes but this is before that article this.
Is like years ago when i wanted to do.
That but they didn't want to do it so.
Weird like hey i want to make your.
Product look really good right now just.
Help me out but nah we're gonna stick.
With all the what myth it might have.
Been worth like he's gonna get really.
Fat like oh what campaign are we trying.
To push right now yeah you know yeah.
Timings everything.
I actually did something when they first.
Release baja blast but it never released.
But they still paid me for it that's.
Nice but it was yeah i don't remember.
Why it didn't go through with the.
Campaign but it's cuz they saw carl's.
Jr. and they're like i think that's why.
They hit me up for it was wrong that.
Time oh really.
Yeah yeah a long time ago a bunch of us.
Got hit up for to do a cartoon or thing.
Like it was like me smosh like a whole.
Bunch of us dave days a bunch of people.
Yeah remember and we all did it and we.
All made our own videos and people just.
Hated us for like a while guys they paid.
Me so much i don't care what you say no.
But i was i was hurt at the time i was.
Like man i never got this much hate.
Before and i was like i'm not gonna do.
This ever again and little did they know.
This is brought to you by name thank you.
Guys so much for watching ninja milcom.
Or yourself case and i talking about.
Nostalgic youtubers yeah another.
Nostalgic thing pokemon actually just.
Made an announcement for a new game you.
Guys know about pokemon go right yeah.
They've announced a game called pokemon.
Sleep this is let me get a joke on a.
Sleeping app to fall asleep - no it's uh.
It's my idol games kind of yeah where it.
Wants you to sleep more and it's like.
The more you sleep like you can catch.
Pokemon or get like better things and.
It's it's kind of dreams dude it's.
Really nice that was.
Yeah you know how much sound effect for.
A drum hit but don't surprise we gui.
There you go that's kind of quiet but.
Okay alright and this is so that's right.
Afterwards it'll be really cool.
Yeah be way funnier so they announced.
That a pokemon study will be turning.
Sleeping into entertainment much in the.
Same way that pokemon go turned walking.
Into entertain could you try to make.
Everyone healthy that sounds like a.
Nightmare okay i mean that's really good.
It was in the new i didn't hear anything.
About that is that recent it was a.
Tuesday it was on tuesday did you play.
Any of those regular pokemon i did.
Collaborate with the pokemon go song kid.
Do you remember him misha.
Speaking of retro youtubers although it.
Was like four years ago.
Misha famous kid from czechoslovakia.
Really okay well it was it was great but.
You didn't play the game i did not know.
Well we kind of played it a little bit.
But i got over it pretty quick cuz it.
Required walking in the house yeah no.
But so many people i actually did it now.
I'm wondering like this makes actually.
Surprisingly this makes more sense.
Because people actually play games for.
That reason like there's idol games.
Where you don't need to play yeah to.
Play the game true and that's huge right.
Now so if it's anything like that it.
Could work better than pokemon go.
Actually yeah i mean it's like.
Interesting that you can but i want to.
Know how they're gonna turn.
Entertainment or sleep into.
Entertainment yeah i don't get that.
Either yeah they're gonna hook wires up.
To your head while you're sleeping and.
Read your dreams it's just a it's a ruse.
To gather information find out more.
About you there how do you know how much.
Do you know about conspiracies do you.
Look into those i kind of like.
Conspiracies i don't believe in them i.
Think they're really fun same me - yeah.
Cool sometimes when it's really.
Creative it's like man.
That's such a stretch but you put in the.
Effort yeah like it takes talent to.
Piece together all these things right i.
Could fit together and what's the most.
Recent conspiracy that you've looked.
Into um gosh i kind of like gosh done.
Recently i never got into the flat earth.
Stuff i know it's kind of more recent i.
Saw that i watched the documentary on.
Netflix i was actually pretty interest.
Off ladders thing was just people like.
Trolling i thought i thought that - i.
Loved it.
Yeah people actually believe that see.
When you look it up though and you watch.
Like you know you it you when you say.
Flat-earthers you picture a certain kind.
Of person you're like okay that person.
Is ridiculous this is so out of the.
Realm of possibility.
But then when you have these people who.
Like oh you actually sound like.
Articulate and you yeah it's just like i.
Can see why some like most people would.
Fall for that well i can see the.
Arguments are there like if you ever.
Really get into it okay not that i'm not.
Saying i believe that are this flat but.
The arguments are really energy yeah if.
You like it with the entertainment.
Factor yeah i think you'll like it's.
Like oh wow they put a lot of thought.
Into this they have a little dance yeah.
They're studying like flight patterns.
And like why certain planes fly a.
Certain way instead of like they eat the.
Quicker route yeah okay and then also.
Certain things like oh like the degrees.
Of earth and how like oh i shouldn't be.
Able to see this far into the distance.
But i do okay it's it's actually is like.
Oh you see like the alright earth i'm a.
Flat chester okay.
I can't develop muscles but good yeah.
You're something else there i mean that.
But i should keep it family-friendly.
Yeah but uh yeah basically the whole.
Thing it it shows in the beginning of.
The documentary like a lot of stuff that.
Makes you kind of like oh i can see like.
How this possibly make sense and you.
Start to like slowly question all that.
You believe yeah and and then i guess in.
The latter part of it the scientists.
Come in and they're like explaining like.
Yeah but the thing too is like the.
Scientists they're surgeons the thing i.
Like about is the certain scientist and.
It's not necessarily a flat or.
Documentary talks about more when you.
Are educated in.
In a certain way of thinking and it's.
Been proven and stuff don't always be so.
Quick to look down on others yeah you.
Know these people who are flat earthers.
What they said was view them as people.
Who could have been potential scientists.
But we're just miss educated you know.
Because they're doing their own form of.
Learning and they're aspiring you know.
Right but so what you can do is you can.
Mentor them so don't be so quick to like.
Look down on them these people are.
Actually like like you said articulate.
Smart they're doing their own research.
They're finding out things yeah it's not.
Easy to make up i mean to come up with.
That stuff there believe it and even.
Have their findings are true even though.
They can be disproved a lot of it to.
Even come up with that is like amazing -.
Yeah but in the same way and i guess the.
Argument is and again i'm not defending.
It i'm just saying you know one of the.
Arguments are that obviously the weight.
The reason why we are already feeling a.
Certain way the moment we say the earth.
Is flat and everybody's like okay dude.
Is because from the moment were born you.
Know and we're brought up in a world.
They show us globes they show us on tv.
Everything you've ever seen and learned.
In school everything you were taught was.
You know a certain way of course you're.
Gonna think it's read atrios the moment.
Like i mean if everybody told us the.
Earth was flat and we had pictures of.
Like in space of a flat earth right our.
Whole lives and all of a sudden someone.
Was like you know what i think it's a.
Globe i think it's round like this is.
Ridiculous people make any sense like it.
We would be think about that like it.
Could be something not that i'm saying.
That i believe that because i don't know.
But there is a point something percent.
Chance that flat earthers are completely.
Right now but there's never a hundred.
Percent there's no 100% of anything yeah.
Science doesn't even believe in how.
You're sitting in the matrix right now.
It could be yep what is it flat or is it.
A round matrix look at the source code.
Sure well then you'd have to hack into.
The system yeah and that's why we bring.
It back to hackers hackers you're a.
Hacker i'm not a hacker oh well when you.
Play basketball you might be oh.
Hacking jack yeah a little deep.
Different big big just talking about.
That but uh oh for the flatter thing i.
Wasn't so much looking at it in terms of.
Like believing the flattered but what i.
Liked about it it's something that we.
Can uh create an analogy.
To a lot of other things is when we have.
A certain way of thinking sometimes.
We're so quick to judge others because.
They don't think how we think where it's.
Like oh you know you believe in flat.
Earth meant like you're dumb yeah you're.
Not you're not here trying to explain it.
You're not here trying to like show a.
New perspective you have this elitist.
Mentality where you wanna just like brag.
Over others yeah yeah and i want to.
Transition that into another thing where.
The state of missouri is now looking to.
Shut down their last abortion clinic oh.
Gosh.
Yeah there mm-hmm and following alabama.
I was gonna say is in this alabama it's.
No georgie alabama's voted on it all.
Right.
And so but the state of missouri is.
Looking to shut down there.last you guys.
Are like trying to get demonetized right.
Now what's the biggest things in news.
Just like what what is your thoughts how.
Can i how can i say gwei into this uh uh.
Ryan's like you're not getting paid and.
I'm like neither are you so i'm just.
Going into that because you know a lot.
Of people are like oh pro-life.
Pro-choice oh you don't get this you're.
Dumb and it's just like that whole opera.
Right not necessarily asking maybe what.
Your stance is on it maybe you if you.
Want to go into that but it's more just.
Like uh do you like what are your.
Thoughts more so on like the whole.
Elitist mentality cuz that'sthat's huge.
Everywhere yeah i mean with all that.
Stuff i love to have my mind changed i.
Always try to keep my mind open like i.
Do believe certain things but if someone.
Wants to try to convince me otherwise.
I'm like totally down and i'm definitely.
Willing to like have my mind changed i.
In fact i find it super enjoyable it's.
Like dang i never thought of that before.
I would have known that maybe i think a.
Little differently so i think if that's.
Just a good mindset to have same for.
Everything i agree with that i think for.
Uh the thing for us though a lot of.
Youtubers who are low-level drama is.
They're very open minded yeah yeah what.
Do you mean it's hard to get it'll drama.
When you don't have like a super hard.
Opinion on yeah right right right.
Yeah because you're so fluid with things.
Cuz you're willing to be swayed you're.
Willing to have listened to the other.
Side right yeah maybe i'm wrong about.
This yeah just to have that thought you.
Know yeah i mean i always have that.
Thought process for most things but i've.
Found that even that can be called out.
On.
Because then you know giving people the.
Benefit of the doubt a lot of times like.
Even if you question the the the.
Majority a lot of times though they'll.
Find ways to mark you to as like on the.
Wrong side like they'll call you an.
Apologist right like people people were.
Shooting what's a good example like wait.
Like when the whole like when the.
President wanted to talk to i think when.
Obama said yeah i'd be willing to talk.
To iran or wherever how how could you.
Even listen to them right yeah exactly.
And then people would just jump on you.
And and if you have opinions about.
Something else too like for example like.
The logan paul situation right and how.
Everybody was completely against him and.
Everybody gets how you know wrong it is.
Right i was there thinking like well i.
Don't think he's the devil.
Like i think he definitely didn't.
Realize it was gonna be you know he.
Wasn't he wasn't trying to i don't think.
He was trying to offend any but i think.
He was just think about himself and like.
How can i make this interesting but.
People were treating it like he's the.
He's the devil.
Like he's literally like has no respect.
For people who are you know but if i.
Were to come on say that it's like oh.
Ryan's being an apologist like yeah but.
I'm not i'm just saying like i think.
People are taking this a little far like.
Hoping he dies you know like right it's.
A little ridiculous what's it's really.
Fun right now for people to like jump on.
The bandwagon of anger i don't know it's.
Canceled culture because in a way it's.
It's a you get to end someone without.
Directly doing it right and so you and.
You can feel like superior like yeah and.
Again so you know back to the elite ease.
Alleviated mentality yeah yeah so i you.
Know and i think it's gonna get to the.
Point where like a lot of people want.
Others to be cancelled yeah.
From my perspective i think is because.
They feel like oh i've done bad things.
You know but if i can make other people.
Who have done equally or worse things.
Right like get cancelled and stuff then.
It makes me feel better yeah you know.
Because now i'm doing a good thing i'm.
Doing a holy thing so maybe it cancels.
Out my fault my sins or my past.
Yeah gonna make yourself feel better.
Right yeah also thing a lot of people.
Just genuinely believe they're right and.
They just think this is the right thing.
For like i mean not saying that they're.
Not but that they believe this is right.
And the majority agrees with me so if.
You think otherwise you're just wrong.
All right i'm gonna pose a question now.
Okay so are you asking for a friend.
How good to someone have to be to get.
Away with a crime well speaking from.
Experience in the youtube world in the.
Youtube world thank you i think you.
Answered it like you just have to be.
Popular like you just have to be.
Populating that it's not even talent.
Really while some people might consider.
It talent but if the more popular you.
Are the more you can get away with but.
Logan was super popular you know yeah.
But for what reasons people never saw.
Him as that way but i mean he's still.
Making videos like it might not be where.
He was at but how about pewdiepie cuz.
He's still like where he's exactly yeah.
Yep and it that's talent in itself to.
Get yourself out of those situations.
Like pewdiepie knew what he liked he.
Knew how to turn everything again you.
Know he was smart enough to be like hey.
These articles said this let me prove.
Them wrong like he's he knew that's a.
Talent to do that chloe didn't have that.
Skill yeah and that whole situation with.
Pda i think he gained way more of a.
Loyal following from that and i think he.
Learned from it and i just saw i could.
See what his mindset was it and he stuck.
With that mentality he's like hey ie.
It's me versus them miiverse this person.
Me versety series it's always like if i.
Can get other people on my side and make.
It give myself an enemy it helps build.
That because you give yourself a.
Competitor you know and that's it is.
What it is and that's how the whole.
Drama scene works too that's why it.
Builds people when it's someone for.
Someone and that's just i mean that's.
Just how that's all it's always been.
Yeah right like the equal amount of subs.
James charles lost.
Tatia games yeah exactly.
Yeah t-series just hit a hundred million.
Saw that channel ever crazy did you ever.
Think that it would get to those numbers.
Back in the day back in the day meaning.
Like 2008-2009 everybody was that like a.
Million yeah at the most i would say and.
I know that when you were the number one.
Most subbed youtube channel.
There was a very for.
Tom i was it was for like less than a.
Week oh okay because it was like i.
Passed i think it was smosh or and then.
Fred fred asked me like a week i was.
Like well i was there for a little bit i.
Was like who's fred yeah and then i.
Think it was like what.
I passed fred again or something and.
Then ray came.
Oh great william johnson then he do you.
Want to just quit and then smosh passed.
Him or something like that and then.
Pewdiepie the rise of pewdiepie and he's.
Just been killing it that's what the.
Algorithm changed for the first time.
Yeah it was based on my gaming long.
Content something like that and see but.
Like like and i've been in this mindset.
Of like hey i want to get back i would.
Be like man pewdiepie's content is it's.
Not real like i would've started.
Something so ever been my chambers his.
Team yeah but i just didn't want do that.
And then in the back you boy drama hey.
Felix do we got each other exactly and.
We would have both grieve and faster but.
He didn't need that i mean he was.
Already milk in the system and he killed.
It you know the thing i respect about.
Him because at first i was like i didn't.
Like his content i was like this is not.
Entertaining to me to watch somebody it.
Wasn't normal to watch them play games.
Right at the time - yeah and the thing i.
Respect about him is that he he realized.
Like okay this is working but i'm gonna.
Evolve and he changed his content to.
What he does not like he actually.
Evolved he didn't just stick with the.
One thing and just keep doing it over.
And over cuz it works and that's when i.
Realized okay he's actually smart he's.
Not just like doing something he gets.
What he's doing very few youtubers can.
Do that yeah sure some people get lucky.
They make it they realize oh this works.
I'm gonna latch on to it but they don't.
Evolve right and then the algorithm.
Eventually changes and then they exactly.
Him yep so i look like pewdiepie if he.
Never slept why because his eyes are.
Smaller my eyes are smaller yeah no.
Really i mean i don't i think you're.
Just being racist.
I think you're just a racist so you just.
Think all white people look the same.
Yeah nah not true there's definitely.
There's definitely different doesn't.
Look anything like felix because you.
Can't go yeah.
Actually can you grow like a full beard.
No i can't.
Really know i've never been able to same.
I just shaved today because i knew i was.
Gonna see paco and he just makes fun of.
Me do the use and girl here for me and.
Just like patches whatever all right.
Well let's get into twitter questions.
Okay because i actually kind of see.
Something that kind of wraps up a lot of.
What we talked about you know you uh.
Someone says oh it's from mickey five.
Luke yeah yeah but they said you're the.
Master at always tweaking your content.
To keep your channel fresh if the.
Youtube algorithm wasn't a thing and you.
Were guaranteed to get millions of views.
Per video what type of content would you.
Produce and i think i want to see from.
Both of you guys yes i think for ryan.
What he would produce is just him.
Sleeping ah the past go ahead okay um i.
Mean if the algorithm wasn't a thing i.
Probably would have never been forced to.
Like venture away from making parodies.
Because news i really yeah really loved.
Doing it it's a really great creative.
Outlet i used to like recreate all the.
Music and like play all the instruments.
And and just really enjoyed creating the.
Music and writing the lyrics and all.
That was really fun about regionals i.
Didn't i did do originals like with my.
Band i used to have like a ska punk band.
Back i old-school but yeah i you know.
Wasn't a thing i probably would still be.
Doing that but because you love you love.
Making music i do love it but i think.
The bigger thing is i won't have been.
Forced to try new things right i really.
I really do love what i'm doing now and.
In fact i think i'm having more fun now.
Then i would if i was still doing.
Parodies right now i just really love.
This whole like series thing and just.
Kind of video 2 video kind of continues.
And it just keeps going and builds it's.
A really cool story so i love what i'm.
Doing now more than back then but yeah i.
Think it was the algorithm that kind of.
Forced me to like adapt and change and.
Try things and so you'll see what would.
Work on youtube yeah how about you right.
What would you be doing um i mean i.
Think i would be.
Going back to making the videos that i.
Was making but taking a longer because i.
Would do it i mean we would we would.
Rush a lot of stuff like even the videos.
People think are like oh that was so.
Great that was so you know we put a lot.
Of time and take like three weeks a.
Month whatever it's all it always could.
Be better.
Yeah and i'm never there's only a few.
Times i was very satisfied with how it.
Turned out and it wasn't completely cuz.
It wasn't completely what i thought it's.
Gonna be in my head but i mean it's.
Gotta be realistic and also to youtube.
So you got to post some time but if i.
Didn't have to worry about that then.
Yeah i would be on that alright i'm just.
Gonna make a dope you no matter how long.
It takes exactly i'm just gonna make.
Something crazy hasn't been done.
Regardless of the time and the right.
Know viewership falling whatever it is i.
Would love to do that but i couldn't i.
Kind of forgot about that demand i mean.
I'm doing it now doing five videos a.
Week but yeah when we did the parodies.
We used to spend we actually used to.
Release like one video every two months.
Right right and just like put a lot of.
Effort to perfection get it really good.
And yeah that was a thing so app kind of.
After the parodies the next thing that i.
Have evolved into was i created a series.
Called crap and the goal with it was.
Like i'm gonna release a video every.
Week because what the parodies just.
Couldn't do it yeah just with just like.
Me and v it does it couldn't do it once.
A week so yeah i'm gonna create a series.
Called crap because the videos are gonna.
Be crap compare it to so funny compared.
To what they used to be and the crap was.
An acronym for comments raps and.
Parodies so i would take like the.
Viewers comments and kind of weave it.
Into a parody song with like very low.
Production value right so yeah yep.
Filler yeah yeah yeah i think um had you.
Even stuck to doing those like parodies.
Though i think like you said you would.
Have got i think you would've got bored.
Eventually of it and you probably would.
Evolved it anyway like you probably.
Would have moved on to what you're doing.
Probably or something different yeah.
Yeah anything you no matter how much you.
Love doing it you you actually want to.
Try something different maybe your.
Current series will become a musical.
Musical that's why i don't want doing.
Musical at all a ninja musical i like.
Doing music stuff but um yeah that's not.
That's not my gift.
Laughter.
What about you wanted what would you be.
Doing if it weren't the algorithm if it.
Were the algorithm al's getting millions.
Of views man i wanna i just wanna do.
Videos with ryan man you know cuz i'm.
Hanging out with him wow yeah i mean.
Podcasts i like doing these because i.
Can just be myself put millions of views.
Yeah that's what i'm saying we could.
Still do this and get me if we got.
Millions of views that's like basically.
Joe rogan right yeah you just do a.
Podcast you just hang out with your.
Friends and you just get millions of.
Views and you know like do a three for.
Our podcast i know the thing is we could.
Do that is just a joe so captivate like.
He's quick on his feet yeah i think part.
Of it is cuz he's always hi.
I mean he is he's super smart yeah and.
The people he brings on are like okay.
It's just like the smartest scientist in.
The world like yet what's his name.
Neil degrasse tyson on and that was such.
An interesting one to me because it goes.
Back to what we were talking about.
Before about like people who are just i.
Mean he's a scientist so obvious he has.
To say certain things and i found it.
Interesting.
He said yeah this is a hundred percent.
There's absolutely no way that we'd let.
We didn't land on the moon ever stop.
Talking about something about when.
Landing and i was like what but i always.
Wondered it i don't know if it's true.
But like as a scientist isn't it wrong.
To say that anything is a hundred.
Percent yeah like albert einstein was.
Like really confident that this this.
Whole quantum mechanics thing wasn't a.
Thing right but he was wrong exactly so.
Confident he could have said 100 with.
That like we were saying he's they're.
Just they're just cocky cocky letus.
