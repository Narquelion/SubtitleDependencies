Hey guys so it is the first video of the.
Year and it and it's two weeks into the.
Year so we're already behind schedule.
Sorry guys i was in hawaii and hence the.
Long hair i don't know what that has to.
Do with hawaii.
I don't know hawaii back to the topic so.
It's about two weeks into the new year.
And it's right about that time or half.
The people who made new year's.
Resolutions have already given up the.
Other half are about to give up and of.
Course is the half that you know never.
Made resolutions plus the half of people.
That actually keep their resolutions.
That's four halves not starting off.
Strong right but anyway i don't know.
About you guys but i always make new.
Year's resolutions and to be completely.
Honest i don't think i've ever kept one.
Throughout the entire year i mean last.
Year my resolution was to stop drinking.
Energy drinks and if you guys watch the.
Behind the scenes you know that i didn't.
Even come close and after really.
Thinking about it and questioning why i.
Always fill my new year's resolutions i.
Think i figured it out i always start.
The year off strong but then over time i.
Slowly start biessing myself and.
Convincing myself that i'm not cheating.
On my goals but i am it sounds confusing.
Let me just show you here's at the.
Beginning of last year kind of look like.
For me this ain't so bad i feel like i.
Energy drink which tonight do have to.
Work today so maybe just one for.
Emergencies push to mean last year i was.
Drinking five a day so two a day is.
Still improvement last time i checked.
Three is still less than five so was.
Four five would be a tie with last.
Year's so i probably shouldn't but then.
Again a tie does hang from a neck and.
The neck is connected to the head so.
This area could be called the ned or the.
Heck is going on with the heck but this.
Year nope.
This year's gonna be different i'm not.
Gonna be asked myself this year and to.
Be sure of that i'm gonna hold myself.
Accountable with me here's your list of.
Resolutions eat healthier go offend.
People and no more cursing fart jokes.
Dark jokes bad puns dad's and red bull.
Actually that should say energy drinks.
Not really that's probably another thing.
You should stop doing you're always.
Promoting random brands for free alright.
Add it to the list then okay see once.
You have your resolutions all you have.
To do is not bs yourself or yourself a.
Carnival and just stick with it.
Especially because right now two weeks.
Into the new year that's when everybody.
Gives up on their goals like that's.
Statistically proven when people don't.
Fact-check me because i made that up but.
You get the point here's some examples.
Of some types of people that you don't.
Want to be two weeks into the new year.
Starting with the new year's.
Person we have all seen it before and.
I'm not gonna lie i've been guilty of it.
Too the new year's high person is.
Exactly what it sounds like it's.
Somebody who's overly hyped for the new.
Year they're so sick of what happened in.
The previous year that they're ready to.
Move on they spend so much time telling.
Other people and themselves how great.
This new year is gonna be and how it's.
Nothing compared to the last year that.
They actually don't make any changes at.
All you've seen them before they all say.
The same old common basic bit huh.
What cursing remember right they say all.
The same old common basic types of.
Things such as i am so ready for 2017.
But it's 2017 ready for me don't live in.
The past live in the now hashtag 2017.
Hashtag ready man i'm so ready for 2017.
I'm ready to put it work.
What no this shouldn't count i was just.
Acting as someone else you still cursed.
I didn't know what content in my videos.
To do or not okay well i didn't know.
That see so can i just start over fine.
But no more chances after that the.
Technicality cheater basically this is a.
Guy who cheats on the resolution by a.
Technicality like i mentioned earlier.
People who ps themselves something i am.
Guilty of actually i'm probably guilty.
Of everything you guys see here because.
I if not i wouldn't have thought of it i.
Wrote this thinking about myself in the.
Past.
Yeah i'm annoying but anyway this is a.
Guy who ps is himself into thinking that.
He's not cheating on his goals when he.
Really is basically they're cheating so.
It defeats the whole purpose.
Looks something like this one drink a.
Day i'm just gonna have one a day i'm.
Just gonna have one slice what what that.
Was just for the skit i didn't even need.
It right i'm you okay i see all the.
Behind the scenes - you can't hide.
Things from me the unrealistic goals.
Person i know this is gonna sound like.
The opposite of every inspirational.
Speaker sometimes i don't think it's.
Good to set your goals too high at least.
Right away especially for one year if.
You set your goal too high and you don't.
See any progress like it's unmotivated.
This is actually another big part of not.
Being yourself you have to be realistic.
Yep this is gonna be the year is the.
Year i become a billionaire nice man i.
Mean you could do it if you really.
Believed.
And i'm gonna practice basketball every.
Single day and finally make an nba team.
An go for us i'm gonna travel the entire.
World and go to every single country who.
It man.
We're ruled you know what this is.
Finally gonna be the year that i get a.
Girlfriend the way to easy goals person.
Pretty much the opposite of the.
Unrealistic goals person this guy who.
Sets there goes way too easy to the.
Point where it's like why do you even.
Have that goal i need to stop using vine.
The person in denial probably all know.
At least one of these people this is the.
Person that makes resolutions about.
Everything other than the actual obvious.
Problem that they have no more i feel.
Better already the person from china is.
Not even new year's yet so she's on my.
Way she bushido dance reproof and she uh.
Yeah the reset button person button.
Button i don't know why people think i.
Say that weird button how are you.
Supposed to set button button there's.
Two teas you gotta say one of them.
Button this is the guy who thinks that.
Just because it's a new year it's a.
Reset button on everything that happened.
In the past year hey man i know we.
Haven't talked in a while but there's.
Figure since is a new year maybe we.
Could just start over.
You know i mean i'm willing to put.
Everything that happened between us.
Behind me if you are so what do you say.
You stole my wallet made out with cat.
Warriors still dating and you ran over.
My grandmother with your car.
Yes and as bad as those things were you.
Know i am still willing to put it all.
Behind me wait is that my wallet is that.
You cat wait oh see it's all behind me.
Now you're feeling two of them now the.
Pun wasn't even that bad and how was.
This a dark joke who killed her.
Grandmother and you threw her ashes on.
The ground yes yes okay i see your point.
But the pun wasn't that bad really was.
Though and that's your opinion my.
Opinion was that it's fine we're the.
Same person.
Fine then let's ask somebody else then.
Was the pun that bad it's not see it.
Come on you can't take the pun go away.
From me i'm actually working really hard.
On that one fine.
Would you still lose the dark jokes.
Resolution deal the secretive person now.
These are for people who have.
Resolutions that they don't want to tell.
Anyone about because it's probably.
Embarrassing and these are the hardest.
Resolutions to keep because they're.
Secretive it's literally all on you hey.
Ryan can i borrow your.
Were you just it's not what it looks.
Like debbie i have a problem hey just.
Curious but why the lotion if you're.
Just dabbing.
Well why not i mean i do use it.
Throughout my entire day after all it is.
Vaseline intensive care advanced repair.
Which can heal your dry damaged skin in.
Less than five days you seem to know a.
Lot about moisturizing lotion yeah i.
Guess you could say i dabble you know.
What i give up wait what it's only been.
One day and i've already like ruined all.
My resolutions already not all of them i.
Mean you still have no cursing no red.
Bow no fart jokes surprisingly i.
Actually thought that was gonna be the.
First one to go and the most important.
One of all don't bs yourself remember.
And if you ask me i actually think.
You're doing a really good job with that.
One i mean you didn't lie to yourself.
When you failed you accepted it and now.
You can learn from your failures and.
Improve yeah yeah you know what you're.
Right it doesn't matter if you fail your.
Resolutions as long as you don't bs.
Yourself actually i don't even need to.
Say bs anymore i'm just gonna say it.
Don't push yourself oh wow okay i think.
You're kind of missing the point.
Oh but i'm a furnace matter that i fail.
All my resolutions in fact i should fail.
Them so that i can improve no you.
Shouldn't try to fill them i think no.
You know what you're right i need to.
Stop both myself and just be me someone.
That makes bad puns and fart jokes and.
And kills grandmothers and throws their.
Ashes on the ground well just being.
Honest with yourself and acknowledging.
Your flaws and your fails are really the.
Only way anyone can actually improve oh.
I guess that last part was kind accurate.
Either that or you could also improve.
Yourself with a nice coat of icing sugar.
Free rainbow energy drink.
Now that is some good bull.
Music.
