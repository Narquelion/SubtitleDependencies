How much does your violin cost no it's.
Like it's like about the price of like a.
Mercedes-benz i can see me i have no.
Reason to hate justin that was just i.
Forced that one but i know you know you.
Try to defend yourself right now but.
You're mean junior arrow knows the real.
Truth clap claps yeah welcome back to.
Another episode of off the pill podcast.
Oh was scary a little bit a little bit.
Scary a little bit late today we are.
Doing fire with a very special guest mr.
Joon sung on say it again sit of.
Sessions on john's song we're here with.
Joon korean that's his other name and we.
Also have david in the moderator seat.
Music.
Paco here in exit well he's a joke so.
We're with joon today many of you may.
Know him from bga we just had justin a.
Couple episodes ago a few episodes ago.
Or you might know him as the violin.
Player or more recently as a real k-pop.
Star not a joke like bga let's talk.
About how you just released a new album.
A real elect legit kpop songs right yeah.
What how recent was that uh it came out.
Last week.
Oh well actually i don't know when this.
Is coming out but or it came out.
Recently you had alan that came out.
Recently that's available for streaming.
Platforms and everything yeah spotify.
What's it what's the name of the album.
Supervised called limbo so june limbo.
Okay and the music video actually looks.
Really it looks legit like where did you.
Do that key that was in korea so i went.
All do it you got real kpop like.
Cinematographers and stuff cuz it allege.
It.
Yeah they shoot a lot of like a jerry.
Peak k-pop group stuff i don't know if i.
Don't like them for our stuff oh i mean.
We can really for sure.
Yeah they look really good well i mean.
No fancy you did the other one and those.
Look good but i think part of it is cuz.
You had real dancers right yeah where we.
Were holding you back.
No i think in korea the film crews just.
Generally know how to shoot kpop stuff.
Very key.
Whereas out here it's like they're not.
Really used to how to shoot the dance to.
Make it look more kpop i guess that was.
You you did that yeah i tried.
So you've choreographed all of that and.
Everything no no no the recent one i had.
A choreographer do the dance so what.
What did you do then for that music.
Video i think so.
The whole album and the project i kind.
Of oversaw the whole project and like.
Making the creative choices on like.
Style concept all that and then the.
Music video i guess technically all i.
Did was um i coordinated getting i was.
Kind of like a producer for a music.
Video um i didn't really direct it but i.
Still i kind of co-directed it i guess.
And then i flew to korea for just one.
Weekend to shoot it and then came back.
Does that happen very often were not.
Necessarily a company will hire people.
To do it but an individual will i don't.
Think it happens that often cuz one it.
Involves like a ridiculous budget and to.
Like i guess the artist is supposed to.
Be focusing on being an artist and not.
Really handling all the little things.
That make a production of production but.
Since i don't have a company nothing i.
Just kind of did it all yes right so i.
Mean for people who don't know jun is.
Also a youtuber well you started it on.
Youtube before all this yeah.
And jun has one point four million.
Subscribers 143 million total views but.
A lot of those views and stuff were even.
Before you got into kpop it was a lot of.
Had to do with you i mean you're known.
As the violinist right you used to do.
Violin covers of of k-pop songs but.
After when when when did you get into.
This whole like was it before bga or.
After bga when you really started to i.
Don't know basically become a kpop star.
Well yeah i started off of youtube just.
Doing like pop songs like american top.
40s covers on the violin it was kind of.
An excuse for me to start the kind of.
Like keep playing the violin so i.
Started that when i was a freshman in.
College and then kpop i think i just.
Started when somebody gave me a.
Recommendation to cover kpop song and i.
Was in a dance crew in college so i kind.
Of put those two together to do like.
Violin kpop dance covers and i was.
Already into that i guess before bg i.
Think that's partially the reason why.
Phil i think i fell david reached out to.
Me to be part of bga and after bga i.
Think yeah because i didn't know you.
Before that no i don't think so i think.
That's when we first yeah and when.
You're the only guy in the group that.
Actually like looks like a kpop person i.
Try it speaks well - yeah yeah i'm full.
Korean so you're though so you can hear.
When cuz apparently i didn't know but.
Apparently david's korean isn't perfect.
So you can hear that he's not good at.
Korean no he's completely fluent oh mom.
Are you yeah born in kuwait you're not.
Like that great did you hear that um.
Side there those lyrics i wasn't born in.
Korea i was born in america i suck at.
Korean thank you very much but harden.
Has said you're korean isn't always.
Great right no it's not.
Like we had to sometimes you'll have to.
Ask your friend when we're writing like.
Lyrics and stuff like like how do you.
Say this i asked jun yeah.
Do you say c i have no walk i wouldn't.
Have known yeah like i mean i can't tell.
That's we were talking about this.
Earlier when we're recording those songs.
Because me and phil we can't speak like.
Any of it it's just making sounds to us.
Like i can't i mean i i couldn't have.
Known that you aren't great at speaking.
Korean i suck.
Do you really know i'm really bad i was.
Not forced to speak korean with my.
Parents growing up i wish they forced me.
But they tried at one point and i was.
Like alright if they were like if you.
Don't speak to us in korean we're not.
Gonna respond to you and i was like.
Alright fine i'm just not gonna talk to.
You then it's holy backfire yeah but.
What they did force you to do was play.
Instruments right yes yes how did you.
Know that because you're a musician oh.
Yeah true so yeah so i grew up playing.
Violin and piano i play a lot of played.
Since i was five.
Violent both instruments actually i hate.
It so much.
Piano and violin both i hated both i.
Hate i hated practicing what about you.
Did you hate violin oh there was a time.
When i really didn't want to practice in.
The beginning when you start a fifth.
Grade fifth grade did you hate it in the.
In the beginning it was kind of like um.
Well actually in the beginning i liked.
It it was actually more out of spite.
Because i'm my best friend played the.
Violin and like you know when you're.
Young you have like playdates and stuff.
Like that people come over and we play.
Video games the one that he would always.
For some reason bring his violin and.
Then kind of like the first 10 minutes.
Of our like hangout session is him.
Showing me like him playing violin like.
Hey i practiced and he would kind of.
Like kind of show off i guess right.
Sounds like i was like i'm kind of.
Jealous i told my mom i was like hey i.
Want to play the violin that's how i.
Started really person if you're watching.
We know what you're like we know what.
You guys are good friends anymore hey.
Harrison look why i'm asking because you.
Said you were born in korea yeah right.
South korea and and not north you're.
Born in south korea and when did you.
Come here.
Well where did you grow up in new jersey.
Okay so he's he's still in jersey no.
He's an sf right now yeah we're he's.
Like my first friend in america because.
I didn't have friends cuz i couldn't.
Speak english so oh really yeah well.
What what grade i guess i moved when i.
Was third grade so i came in third grade.
I was i was great at math class that was.
The only class that i was like i went up.
To the board and i did all the math.
Problems and then every other closets.
Every other class was pretty rough for.
Me really did you get bullied i didn't.
Get believed because i was in the esl.
Program like pasta foreign kids program.
So even if he did get bullied he.
Couldn't understand why i pushed in.
Stuff is like yes yes yes well it's.
Crazy you don't know i mean like i guess.
You grew up lancaster agree with it what.
Ages at 7 like 9 finish oh really.
Yeah oh okay well i'm still kind of.
Surprising you have no accent whatsoever.
No i'm really i mean i don't hear it i.
Hear seriously you're talking quick i.
Got a question here about your.
Instrument cuz you know that's your main.
Weapon of choice right in the violin i'm.
Wondering how.
Much does your violin cost it's pretty.
To personal doing no it's like it's like.
About the price of like mercedes-benz.
Like suv i would say that's that's a lie.
You're not even joking no i'm not even.
Joking do you.
You own it yeah i own it i have.
Insurance on it it's like it's a i.
Forgot what it's called like when you.
Get something really expensive like.
Jewelry you right yeah yeah so you get.
It appraised right yeah so my valens.
Appraising and stuff like that cuz i.
Could be wrong but there there are.
Actually violins out there that are very.
Expensive and are rented out to people.
Right yeah yeah i think um there's.
Violence that can range up to like a.
Couple million and stuff that is stupid.
Yeah it's crazy for a piece of wood no i.
Mean like okay would you be if you if i.
Were to have a million dollar violin.
Somewhat not me like some who can play.
It and mercedes-benz while it which is.
150 grit know how much i don't want to.
How much is a i would say like around 50.
50 grand violin and a cheap violin but.
Not like it's like around 100 hundred.
Bucks 200 if we were if they were all.
Were to play the same thing you would be.
Able to tell which is which actually it.
Might be kind of hard to tell the.
Difference between the mercedes benz and.
The million dollar one but definitely.
Like the cheap cheap ones like the.
Factory made ones they're like the ones.
That are like in like music shops like.
For example like an instrument you get.
At like sat match for example or.
Something like that is not probably not.
That one i can tell the difference.
Between that and like my violin or like.
A couple million dollar fine or.
Something hmm did you did you have - is.
It like a payment thing or like how does.
That usually work like you have to go.
Into a back alley or you go into yeah.
You have to bring like a suitcase and.
Everything it's pretty pretty shady you.
Know it's hard to tell when you're being.
Sarcastic.
Yeah this is second language okay i.
Don't.
What is the has anyone ever it's a.
Stradivarius.
Yeah have you uh as anyone ever lets you.
Play it i've only touched the.
Stradivarius.
Once i don't know what is this word what.
Is that it's the name of the person who.
Made the violin oh ah you haven't.
Touched him no no the violin that he.
Made i touched hundreds of years ago.
Right he was yeah couple hundred years.
Ago i think there's only two hundreds.
Treads in the whole world are we talking.
About the mercedes ben no this is this.
Is the million dollar oh god these are.
The ones that are in museums and so how.
Can you even play them like what if you.
Dropped it like oh then the one that you.
Have oh mine yeah that's like 50 grand.
Like what if there isn't do you.
Lose like 20 that's 20 grand already.
Like you don't think we do like crash.
Your car yeah you fix it so like i think.
David can speak from experience but like.
Um people fix it it's like piece of wood.
And then it's still worth the same like.
My violin for example it's like almost.
Like 300 years old mine and then there's.
Like a section on the bottom of the vial.
And it's completely shattered and.
Reglued so it's been older than america.
1776 so i mean like okay so if you if it.
Was really me 300 years ago and you're.
Saying there's a bunch of these right.
Even older than that that are worth more.
It's kind of like wine and get it's.
Worth more as time goes on.
Mm-hmm do you know the previous owners.
Like how did you how did it get into.
Your hands i actually don't know the.
Previous owners but it was made in.
Germany for example and i mean not for.
Example it was made in germany i got it.
From my violin person in new york he.
Does a lot of like professional.
Violinist like um probably don't know.
But like midori caught them like these.
People are um midori is green japanese.
Oh really yeah a lot of names for anime.
Sorry i didn't mean oh no that's but.
Then on the he he has a lot of those.
Like really expensive islands and like.
Cheaper ones i don't know where he got.
It from but i got it from him in new.
York.
Yeah can i thought will be could you pay.
For it sorry well my parents didn't you.
My grandpa my grandpa grandma helped out.
A lot on lawrence to like an investment.
It's kind of i mean if you keep it like.
No i'm thinking about it like it's like.
Gold right you just keep in.
Violet you should get a bunch of.
Violations hold on to it that's a coin.
That's always bitcoin it wasn't a.
Mercedes-benz you a suv cost when i got.
It oh what was that the passat because.
Of inflation that's probably partially.
That too but then another thing is um.
Violins like the more you play it the.
More the sound develops as in the sound.
That my violin made when i first got it.
And now it's completely this wow that's.
The opposite of a car yeah i guess we.
Can drive it the worse it is oh so do.
You.
Yeah that's kind of interesting yeah so.
You could just have like a farm right a.
Violinist buy a bunch and just have them.
Play all day and in you're making money.
Yeah yeah right yes it's appreciate.
That's yeah but like i mean like how did.
Pottery if you're reselling it like how.
Can you prove like okay this is played.
For like a thousand hours since i got it.
So it's worth that much more i think it.
Really depends on like the professionals.
Opinion like i'm not in the right so.
Like i can't really decide what it costs.
Is but i bring it back to the guy he.
Fixes it up for like a week comes back.
And he's like probably like cool so they.
Do but they realize oh you played this.
So x amount but they can hear it as a.
Sound and stuff like see how much the.
Sound is and it's more and stuff like.
That they can they have like yeah it's a.
Combination of like the sound it's the.
Combination of looking through the.
Sometimes like the person who made it.
Will put like a signature inside the.
Violin too and you can kind of.
Authenticate that but how do you know.
How much it's been played as i'm saying.
You can't really tell that but you can.
Kind of like measure look at the wood.
And there's a lot of different factors.
That are involved with that so i think.
It's because my parents own a music.
Store my mom is a restores she does that.
She does that for a loose take your.
Thing to him and then see how much more.
Since you've been playing it actually.
What you should do is just start the.
Farm man like start the pile there's a.
Good business you know i know you.
Actually bring up a good point because.
Actually some of the more expensive.
Instruments that my mom has she actually.
Has people play it she should make it.
Worth more.
Yeah because it opens out even more yeah.
You know like a violin sitting in a.
Museum like for several years will sound.
Pretty bad i don't think the average.
Person knows like i didn't know anything.
I didn't know violence cost that much.
For one.
Now i'm starting to think every violin.
I've ever seen how much was that really.
Warlike lindsey sterling her violins.
Can't be worth that much right i think.
When it's when you put electric when.
It's an electric violin which is what.
She usually plays those it's worth less.
Worth less yeah because there's that it.
Doesn't really depend on the wood and.
Stuff it's more technology that makes it.
So much so you're almost like a kpop.
Lindsey stirling in a way yeah i dance i.
Play violin yeah yeah and i guess a.
Transition into that because we need to.
Talk about kpop i kind of want to know.
And touch up on i guess your your.
History in your past and how you kind of.
Got into kpop and how you're like trying.
To integrate it into your youtube.
Channel and did you even audition for.
Like did you even audition for like you.
Know actual k-pop groups yeah i i.
Addition once in college and then once i.
Got um i guess notified from some.
Company when i moved out to la right.
After college but um.
Kpop was just always something i.
Listened to because my sister's really.
Big kpop em she still is and a shout out.
To her but harrison gets one thank you.
Which macaulay a kpop i just got into.
Cuz somebody recommended me like praying.
Playing a k-pop song and i danced in.
College so kind of combined it to and i.
Made a cover people liked it and then i.
Started listening to kpop i started in.
Doing dude really there's ghosts here.
Well i want to know like this i try to.
Just move on dude can we cut real quick.
For real let's cut hook with this ghost.
In here man that what is happening yes.
Damn maybe we should show this is scary.
Haunted edition.
Music.
Dude we're all a little freaked out that.
Was really weird it could be a.
Coincidence it's never happened before.
My house this is so dude do we ever.
Announce this is at your house this.
Podcast this podcast is in this l a.
Podcast is at david's house and there's.
There's girls here now we know david you.
Have to live here anyway if more weird.
Things happen i mean we're going through.
The footage when you go through the.
Footage crazy-eyed even though that.
First thing fell to be honest for our.
Listeners there's two large bangs you.
Heard actually you might have heard some.
Voices because it's being recorded i.
Don't know a couple of our painting.
Things fell like right back to back and.
They didn't fall all day so like i don't.
Know.
Yeah it's really weird uh-huh anyway.
Getting back on top every time so julie.
Actually has a good point.
Do you believe in ghosts cuz you you.
Said just now you were like oh man i got.
Like goosebumps no i got a lot of.
Goosebumps um i don't i don't i don't.
Want to believe in ghosts i think it's a.
Mentality thing where if you don't.
Believe it and you're strong but you do.
If you're strong so it's really.
Interesting to me because there's i've.
Heard a lot of stories about the kpop.
Industry especially as of late right.
There's some articles going around like.
About how little they get paid actually.
For how much they're bringing in i don't.
Know what's true i've heard some stories.
But since you've been kind of in that.
World not that you're you you went down.
That industry route are those there is.
There truth to those rumors of what like.
How poorly they're treated like or i.
Mean david knows too you know a lot of.
People in that industry yeah i've heard.
I've definitely heard some stories yeah.
You know i think i think something.
Important to note is that we only know.
Of like sm yg jyp like a lot of these.
Big big hit now at bts we know these big.
Groups big companies but there's like.
Hundreds of entertainment companies on.
In korea and there's like thousands and.
Thousands of kids that are trainees that.
May never even get to debut even if they.
Like they might be a trainee for 10.
Years and they might not get chosen to.
Debut so there's so many people in that.
Industry that it's kind of like hard to.
Say like this one example like is the.
Same for all of it but i think there is.
A lot of truth in those stories don't.
Just exist for no reason i feel like no.
No that's like that's something i never.
Really like have like a strong opinion.
On well i only know because i mean we.
Know some people in that industry and.
I've heard stories not to say that i.
Know it's true or not but since you guys.
Are more i mean you know more than i do.
I mean i've heard things were like they.
Force you know the trainees or whatever.
To essentially like they they force him.
To get like plastic surgery for.
Sometimes and they force them to even.
Like do sexual things with people like.
Kind of    them out yeah.
But so you know that that so it is true.
That's true so you know from personal.
Experience yeah actually yeah i know.
Someone should i even say this story i.
Won't say names i don't say names but i.
Will say that i know someone who was.
Spilled of that industry i'm trying to.
Be very careful be careful this person.
Offered services quote-unquote services.
To somebody i know who is wealthy for.
Basically hinting at if you pay me i.
Will do i will sleep with you and.
They're in the kit in their campus.
Recital.
Yes and you know them personally and.
They told you this know the rich person.
The rigid person told me this i so it is.
True then because i've heard that and.
I'm not i didn't hear it from david i've.
Heard it from someone completely.
Unrelated so it is truth that stuff.
Happens and i also heard that not only.
Do they do that.
They do it for a reason because.
If you ever go against the label but the.
Label does is they basically use it as.
As blackmail so if you ever go against.
Them they'll release that information.
And they'll have some kind of like sex.
Tape or some kind of scandal to cut.
Basically just ruin your reputation in.
Korea yeah right and it's way worse.
There yeah in korea if you have a sex.
Tape your your career is over.
Right whereas in america it's just it's.
Just begun jun any you got a black male.
Jun.
We've already becomes the big star so i.
Mean like i guess since you kind of.
Almost got into that world i'm kind of.
Curious actually because there is there.
Or there are a lot of benefits to going.
Down that route right like you you get.
Instant exposure well not i guess like.
You said it's not for everyone yeah but.
I think i think if you debut so again.
It's like if you're a trainee it doesn't.
You don't really get the benefits except.
Like the resources but once you debut i.
Think like in the big three like sm ji.
Pyg i think definitely um you get that.
Instant exposure literally overnight.
Fame like if you if ji p posts a teaser.
For a new group they're instantly famous.
Overnight kind of thing and they do a.
Lot of press marketing as well as again.
Like financially they help with all the.
Resources training music video budget.
All that kind of stuff like you seem.
Like the kpop music videos they're like.
Pretty insane scale wise so i think.
There's a lot of benefits in that and.
But also a lot of downsides as you.
Mentioned right and doing it.
Independently i think it's a lot more.
Fun in my opinion because i get to.
Control everything and i think that's.
More important to me then i guess like.
Being famous like that quick very easily.
I guess yeah so for all those young kids.
Out there who look at k-pop stars and.
Aspire to be like them how do you become.
A kpop star.
I don't be korean or asian actually know.
They're expanding yeah there's a thai.
There's a lot of like um like half.
Korean people there's a lot of chinese a.
Lot of thai and yeah that's it's not.
It's not limited to being korean i think.
I think it's if you have what it takes.
Like talent.
Wise as well as you have the passion i.
Think the most important thing is the.
Passion to do it because it's not just.
About you being good at something you.
Have to like looking like a kpop idol.
Right because there's that like image.
Static k-pop idol has when you're on.
Stage f2l you look really pretty really.
Cute really like cool or like sexy or.
Whatever it is you kind of have to like.
Fit in that world you have to have what.
It takes and i think that's the thing.
That makes somebody a k-pop idol or.
Artist more so than the music or the.
Talent cuz that like you just changed a.
Kpop song to english it becomes american.
Pop it's not right i don't think i never.
Thought kpop was at genre kpop is like a.
Whole package just pop in korean yeah.
And you just have to have the image the.
Dancing the production all that package.
That's what makes it there's actually a.
Lot of controversy about that too right.
Isn't there like a what is that the.
Award show is announcing a kpop category.
And bts fans are really upset because.
They're they feel like they're putting.
They created that category just so that.
They're not competing against other pop.
Artists and because bts is huge right.
Now so i forget i can't even remember.
What award is something big i don't know.
If it's like grammys or didn't i know.
There there is a there was a lot of.
Contrary recently they announced it and.
There was a bunch of like bts people who.
Are really upset and and it is that's i.
I mean i get it but it's kind of like.
Why wouldn't they be allowed in the pop.
Category yeah you know it's still pop.
And there is english in it like i don't.
Know it's lose the mtv mtv vma awards oh.
That's nothing what are they getting mad.
Over speaking about being cancelled.
Right and stuff like that like don't you.
Think like if you ever were to make it.
Like the goal is to make it big right.
Like if you ever were to make it big.
Don't you think aren't you worried that.
These like we just talked about all dark.
And dirty these labels play aren't you.
Worried that that you're like going.
Against the grain and you're like.
Sitting example for people like they do.
You must i mean you you will be on their.
Target list like they don't want people.
To create themselves on their own they.
Want you to be like hey we need this.
Label to make it.
Aren't you afraid at some point they're.
Gonna target you or maybe it had they.
Reached out to you already to try and.
Get you under them mmm no i mean i do.
Get like like some like it's like no.
Name entertainment labels sometimes.
Reach out to me here and there but um i.
Don't think gun like a target one.
Because like i think i'm still starting.
And i'm still kind of discovering myself.
And this music career side of things but.
I think the beauty is that my youtube.
Channel has me for like the past eight.
Nine years mm-hmm and you can see the.
Full history of me right and i think.
That's something that's very nice to.
Have like almost like a portfolio for.
Myself and i think people looking to be.
In the kpop industry like there's one.
Part that they have to think about what.
Do they have to lose for me a big choice.
Of not joining a label was because i had.
Too much to lose because i had that.
Whole like i guess like um portfolio of.
Me being a youtube violinist that if i.
Did sign to label for example they'd.
Probably like make me get rid of my.
Youtube channel maybe get rid of my.
Instagram anything so like wow i have a.
Fresh new plate that's how they would.
That's how they like their i donate.
Right so they can write everything for.
Them and they interesting kind of things.
Is that that's one thing i think is a.
Little bit different because in like the.
American industry for example like they.
Won't do that like the artist has full.
Control right and i think that's always.
How i should be um but in but kpop i.
Think is just completely different the.
Culture is different and what they're.
Looking for in k-pop idols and how that.
Markets how that sells it's completely.
Different from like justin bieber for.
Example it's a totally different image.
So i think it works for that end but for.
Me i don't think i need to like.
Necessarily keep myself tight to kpop.
Mm-hmm necessarily because i'm it just.
Made sense for my demographic to do kpop.
Right now but i would consider myself.
More of a korean-american artist rather.
Than a kpop artist interested it kind of.
Sounds like the packaging for korea is.
Really about inorganic you know like.
Everything is oh it's almost like.
Plastic surgery which is something.
That's widely accepted they're like they.
Wanted everything to look clean-cut well.
Produced we're in the more western.
Westernized the entertainment it's kinda.
Just like be edgy be original make your.
Own stuff but still have like.
Hints a formula there yeah yeah for sure.
Yeah so i what are you looking since you.
Said that you know this is what you want.
To do for now what is your your next.
Goals because after uh.
I guess this kpop days is over for you.
Whenever well this mini album was like.
Kind of me just really trying to getting.
Get it out of my system like i have a.
Physical cd i have a music video i have.
A lot of like i i featured an actual.
K-pop idol and one of these songs and.
Then um so it's just something that i.
Really wanted to get out of my system.
Because i never was able to do it and.
Finally i got to do it so honestly right.
Now i'm kind of just like i don't know.
What i really want to do i kind of want.
To see where this album goes yeah as.
Well as work on music that's not maybe.
Not in korean i'm just like and i want.
To kind of bring the violin back because.
I think i kind of pushed that away on.
Purpose because i wanted to like really.
Focus on like original like singing.
Rapping that kind of stuff but i want to.
Bring the violin back and see how can i.
Can incorporate that in my future.
Content so so you'd be open to.
Continuing this if this blows up for you.
And does like really well yeah i mean i.
Don't think it necessarily needs to blow.
Up but i think i want to follow it.
Because it's still a passion for me like.
Music is still a big passion but maybe.
Kind of seeing where that might lead me.
With like my film side of stuff - yeah.
Soundtrack stuff maybe is the youtube.
Enough to kind of sustain a career for.
You i would say i took a really big.
Hiatus like two years no violin playing.
No violin covers and like content on.
Youtube for a while and like youtube is.
Kind of it's very important that you.
Know like you have that consistency on.
Youtube to maintain that number so all.
The fans watching my content right now.
On my channel are were originally there.
For the violin content not for the k-pop.
Content so i would say i'm i've.
Rebranded my youtube it's almost like.
Starting on your youtube channel so i'm.
Right now not now i don't think so but.
Um i think hopefully eventually yeah.
Because it's because i know there's a.
Lot of musicians out there that you know.
It's it's difficult to do music.
Full-time right you know you're lucky.
You're one of the lucky ones if you're.
Able to so you know when it comes to.
Making money.
I know youtube pays.
Percentage of ad revenue and then you.
Know you sell merch do you have a.
Patreon do you do you do live shows like.
Is that kind of where do you make money.
As well or randle's yeah i think right.
Now it shows shows were the biggest like.
Last year for example i did a lot of.
Like university shows with like my.
Violin content and then moving forward i.
Think i have like a physical album cd.
That came out that was actually mostly.
Again kind of getting it out of my.
System like i can say i have like a.
Legit k-pop album i was like little.
Photo cards and stuff like that so.
That's one merch possibly like more like.
T-shirt merch merch i think is always an.
Option moving forward but um for now.
It's still more of a passion project i.
Would say.
So for fans you want to support you what.
Are the top two revenue generators for.
You where they can support and help you.
You know get to a full-time position.
Mm-hmm i would have to say just stream.
It and like 10 million 30 million just.
Keep streaming hit that refresh button.
Or you could start the violin farm or do.
Violin from you i'm telling you man.
That's a good business.
It sounds like telling you i don't know.
What the numbers are actually but it.
Sounds like it could be a good business.
It's a good return it just takes a long.
Time hounds like it could be a good.
Business on this horrible transition.
Let's go into some some questions we got.
From twitter yeah that sounds good.
Sorry i'm reading like these are so good.
I mean speaking about like kpop and bg a.
Music.
Splendid you'll ask do you hate justin.
Did we just did we talk about that about.
How like the last podcast justin was we.
Were talking talking how much about.
You oh yeah i mean did you get - did you.
Get to listen to that well i got i got.
Notified by some hey justin said some.
Mean things about you.
Fandom my fans are like and then.
Somebody took it actually really.
Seriously did they somebody actually got.
Hurt.
Oh really they're like they're like i.
Can't believe dee talked about you i was.
Like no it's a joke i'm pretty sure it.
Was a joke if i went i watched i watched.
It to the point when puck was that like.
There's no way jun will make it through.
This point in the past i show you uh and.
He's like well i can leave now yeah i.
Was there and i would i just made fun of.
My youtube username jun korean yep no.
Biking shirt didn't know that it was it.
Curry on was korean.
Yeah i appreciate a lot of people that's.
Like the malay actually did i didn't.
Realize till later on whenever you know.
How you do q&a here and there sometimes.
Right like that's the number one.
Question i get like every single time no.
Matter how many times i explain it like.
An am screen name back when they i am.
Used to be a thing mm-hmm carry it over.
To my google gmail account that carried.
Over to my youtube account and then.
That's juice so now we know where to.
Email you basically yeah pretty much.
Sure you guys fighting.
But do you hate justin use mmm no i.
Don't i i have no reason to hate justin.
Maybe after the podcast episode maybe.
We're calling me out like that's i.
Already said that like we were like oh.
We're gonna get jun to like talk show.
But that sounds like i don't think jun.
Would do that even even if it was real.
Yeah let's just hear you what would you.
Be your bestest is this your your yeah.
Let's come back now that you're in front.
Of mike yeah justin's right here and i'm.
Justin and i just said fu june or you.
Look like a catfish oh my god you're way.
Leaner than i am wow.
We need ac paris in the side-by-side his.
Whiskers right now well i mean he got a.
Beard i saw i was watching the podcast.
Without thinking it on the back last.
Night.
Oh wait no it was so ag but it was such.
A deep.
That's a major dislike at fish it's like.
He was waiting to see a real place.
Because we have the back of the dead.
Yeah like i have no reason to hate.
Justin that was just i forced that one.
But no defend yourself right now but.
You're mean junior everyone knows the.
Real truth but to be fair justin was a.
Pretty mean to you as well no but that's.
Like i mean that so that became a thing.
On the first shoot i think after a.
Little bit and naturally progressed and.
In the second one i started writing it.
In because it just naturally progressed.
It's like it's a realist in the young.
Boy you see the otis yeah yes the oldest.
And the youngest and it's like a natural.
Like it's funny you think the.
Relationship works but it's really like.
That in real life too.
Yeah it's a it's carried on it's yeah.
It's not it's not an on-screen thing.
It's just naturally like yeah he'll do.
It even if the cameras were off right.
Now justin's voice in my head as soon as.
Said catfish like that high-pitched.
Voice i don't i don't think he sounds.
Like that very good impersonation in.
Person but you know what i'm saying he.
Did say that he he would make love to.
You.
And i did i i don't know if you believe.
That he would but it wasn't a sarcastic.
He did say that he did say that i mean.
He he twee he said he would grab you by.
The hair.
We don't have we're not trying to.
Demonetized here yeah but he'll say.
Things like that.
Yeah and he won't say just kidding mm.
Even though we know just so you know.
It's a love-hate relationships all of.
Hate relation but anyway so we have a.
Few more i want to know this but i don't.
Know i don't know where this one came.
From have you ever had any rude.
Encounters from famous k-pop idols rude.
Encounters or maybe a wholesome.
Encounters i want to hear the rude ones.
Yeah.
Give me the rude ones cuz i'm sure.
You've come across a bunch since you go.
To kcon and you do all those like you.
Know you're kind of in that industry no.
Yeah.
At kcon i do this thing i do a lot of.
Things where i'm imc because i'm.
Bilingual um so they have these things.
Called fan engagements where they come.
On stay.
Age they answer like twitter questions.
Like this like kind of like this setting.
A gonna interview but i take the.
Questions i asked him in korean i.
Translate it for an audience and stuff.
Like that i won't say a groups name.
Because i don't want to like cause kpop.
Yeah i don't say names actually you.
Could that's terrifying people but then.
There was this one specific member of.
This girl group that was just completely.
Different on stage and how she was.
Offstage like the second she got.
Offstage she like called for a manager.
Got like where's my water where's my.
Water like a diva i could not not just a.
Diva there like a diva but it's super.
Like like a really    diva like to.
The point where like on stage she was.
Like i really have the second she came.
Down her smile just disappeared her face.
Just completely changed right so i don't.
Think it was rude to me i think people.
Dealing with her honored right would.
Feel that she's very rude all the time.
But maybe she was having a bad day or.
Something but that's the bad one what's.
Your name what does it rhyme with oh.
Drink the the kpop fans woman is that.
The girl group like pink's oh no i did.
Not say that.
No no but that's like one of the biggest.
Girl groups right yeah it was them it.
Was them we're just gonna start it well.
Figure out which one june said okay so i.
Mean well that kind of goes back to what.
We were talking about though like it's.
Very artificial right not nothing.
Everybody is like that but to a certain.
Degree like they have to be like the.
Cutesy personality on stage if not it's.
That's there's a reason why they're all.
They act very similar yeah and it's it's.
Kinda you understand that right yeah.
Following like a formula and stuff like.
That like i have like for example for me.
Like i have to say nice things about.
Justin to have that facade of me being.
The nice member of the behave exactly.
The scenes are just making out kind of.
Going off of that what is the weirdest.
Fan encounter you've had that i've had.
Um cuz i mean this is a question we.
Usually ask like the girls cuz usually.
Their stores are pretty wild it's always.
Stalkers yeah but have you had any weird.
Ones i'm sure mmm.
I think it was i forget if it was that a.
Kate connor so i'm no it was at one of.
The cake cons most of my experience has.
Come from kcon because that's one of the.
Kpop fans come there was one fan that.
Literally followed me everywhere knew.
Which hotel i was in so there's a.
Stalker story hmm yeah but this one was.
Weird cuz i'm like i don't know how she.
Knew but then like the next like one.
Like i saw her at the hotel in the lobby.
And she made eye contact then i like you.
Know like when you see a person then.
They recognize you and like and stuff.
Like that so i was like oh it's a fan.
Stuff like that we took a picture she.
Asked for a picture and then and then.
The next morning i woke up i was getting.
Ready to go to the convention i walked.
Out of my room and she was in the.
Hallway and she was just sitting in the.
Corner of the hallway she's something.
She's like oh shoot i'm sorry and she's.
Like that's a bunch of stuff but i was.
Honestly like really creeped out to say.
Anything or like comprehend what was.
Happening but then that happened to date.
Three days in a row dude yeah she was.
Scary stuff like that so that was a.
Slightly creepy the third day she's just.
Sitting outside your door oh that was so.
She just the reason why these things you.
Know she was here the whole time.
Okay well then yeah that's like a.
Stalker story you know seems like we.
Have one more question and it says well.
That's kind of we kind of answered that.
Already.
Tell us about it's not through bga stuff.
Other questions jun do you remember when.
I met you in the lobby in your hotel i.
Got one go ahead that your fans might.
Want to know about unless they already.
Know mm-hmm are you single am i single.
Music.
Yeah how long have you been in your.
Relationship or is that private.
Information no it's been a little over.
Three years now wow.
Yeah actually like a month after three.
Years girl we know right yeah we met.
Yeah she's actually our stylist noir.
Who's it kind of and she was on.
Some of your videos right yeah she's.
Singing oh wow do you guys plan on.
Collaborating more or mmm yeah maybe.
Like honestly like now that i'm kind of.
Getting into the singing rapping stuff.
Like that it would be really nice to.
Have a song together i think would be.
Really nice but um she's reliving -.
Right yeah she's phone and griemann how.
Does she feel about all of this success.
That you're experiencing right now well.
She's kind of like my reality check.
Always as in like she'll humble you.
Humble me maybe a little too much in.
What ways though like what it was like.
What i can't imagine you being cocky or.
I mean yeah that's like generally i.
Don't but like for example like when.
You're in a relationship or like with.
Family or something you kind of want.
That like like them to kind of credit.
You or just like crazy a little bit you.
Know like kind of like that child in me.
That i want like my girlfriend to watch.
My video and be like oh my god you look.
So good and stuff like that for example.
Like she'd compliment but at the same.
Time humbled me at the same time she's.
Look at my most recent music video for.
Example she would watch it and she'd be.
Like who is that guy he's so.
Good-looking.
It's like a compliment but yeah so she.
Is compliment think she is appreciating.
But at the same time she knows to like.
Make sure it doesn't get to my head and.
Stuff got it got it do you think it.
Makes some of your fans jealous that you.
Have it you're taken you think her um.
Yeah i think initially like we've been.
Public for a while but um i guess some.
People still don't know even though i.
Post pictures with her all the time and.
Stuff like that but um there are.
Instances when people do get jealous and.
Are really mean to her on her instagram.
For example people like make fake a.
Constant like you really mean on our.
Instagram well isn't it normally like.
The kpop like people bands like people.
What they don't have relationships right.
No that's like a big like if you have a.
Girlfriend boyfriend than your career.
And isn't there a thing to like i don't.
Know because i just read bja comments.
Isn't anything like that there's usually.
A couple guys that like you and justin.
Who do have some kind of bromance thing.
Going on.
Yeah the group there's always one right.
Yeah yeah how many how many not that i.
Don't know that you would know how many.
Of those actual like bands either how.
Many how many gay people are in the kpop.
Industry do you think.
Personally i think there is plenty.
Really there's a lot but you're right.
It's not accepted in korea it's accepted.
Like out here like people like kpop fans.
Prefer that yeah it seems like it.
Because they would rather have two.
Members dating each other than them.
Dating different girls right because.
They don't want to like ruin the facade.
Yeah they want that fantasy of being.
Able to be with them at one point but if.
I'm not able to get you then i'd rather.
Have right david be with you for example.
Doing this that's kind of i just had an.
Image in my head.
Yeah well people trust me have images of.
You and justin so i have the next one.
The next skit we're gonna write is just.
Like softcore porn well do you monetize.
