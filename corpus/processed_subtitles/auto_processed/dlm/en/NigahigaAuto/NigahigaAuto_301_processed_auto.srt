I don't know about you guys but i have.
The most awkward situations when i first.
Shake someone's hand maybe it's just me.
Maybe i'm just off now i couldn't be i'm.
Sure everyone has experienced an awkward.
Handshake before especially to all you.
Guys you know what i'm talking about.
Right every single group of friends has.
Different handshakes that they and i can.
Never remember which of my friends do.
Which type of henshin i've had a lot of.
Awkward handshakes in my life but.
Recently i just had one of the most.
Awkward handshakes i've ever experienced.
Before and it basically inspired me to.
Make this video there's really no way to.
Reenact how bad or awkward this was but.
It kind of went like this so there i was.
About to enter a house party with my.
Friend derek but we'll call him darrin.
To protect his identity i'm not gonna.
Lie i was a little nervous because i.
Don't go to many parties where i don't.
Know anyone and these people were all.
Derek's for dead darren's friends we.
Entered the house and just like any.
Other party there was a lot of people.
There instantly my heart started beating.
Faster and faster knowing what was.
Coming next that's when the guy throwing.
The party came over to greet devin and.
Myself i watched as he went over to.
Dennis and gave him the classic.
Handshake to hug flawlessly and that's.
When it happened.
Don't have been pointed to me and said.
The worst that would lead to my.
Inevitable day and as he turned to me i.
Had to make a decision what handshake.
Should i give him i know for a fact that.
He does the handshake to hug me because.
I just saw him do it to dexter but he.
Also lives in a relative in this house.
Which means he's probably some kind of.
Businessman that there's a lot of.
Business handshakes but this was a.
Business this was a house party with his.
Buddies so maybe he just wants to pound.
It yeah that's what he wants.
Hey what's up mask yeah that's when i.
Realized i had to get out of here with.
Or without darrin either that or what i.
Have to kill every single person that.
Wins the darrin and that's when i.
Realized i was narrating all out okay so.
Maybe i exaggerated that just a tad.
That's that that's not what happened but.
The situation was pretty awkward and i.
Probably won't be hanging out with those.
Guys anymore i'm tired of always having.
Awkward handshakes with people there are.
So many different handshakes in the.
World and i believe the more handshakes.
You know the more prepared you'll be.
When it happens and after countless.
Hours of research and lab tests and.
Googling i created the ultimate.

Situation no matter how awkward but.
