Is back we have ryan higa and i'm the.
Host seat.
Yep yeah hot seat i don't know i never.
Knew what that meant the hot seat really.
You know what it means now no we're.
Gonna like it's like like our knee drill.
You want questions yeah all like being.
Interrogated yeah yeah we're in the.
Interrogation he would technically be in.
The hot seat because right here in the.
Hot seat today well i mean we're all.
Talking i'm asking for questions.
That'd be nice having you talk more yeah.
People don't know this so derek i mean.
You've seen him in videos and stuff he.
Just got back from china he has been.
Gone you haven't been in a video for a.
Long time it's been like a month month.
And a half or so yeah but derek was in.
China dancing for the jabbawockeez yeah.
It was fun i basically took a small leap.
From arch pc and i started doing.
Rehearsals in las vegas and we're.
Preparing for our show which was like.
Pretty much like six weeks over mgm co.
Tie which is in china macau that's a.
Part of china isn't it cult i know macau.
Yeah well i'm sorry go tie is like.
Saying like the city macau is like the.
Town yeah yeah okay so it's a town in.
The city that's where you want yes vote.
Aye yeah that's what we would say to the.
Taxi drivers cuz there's two strips.
Right out there so like vegas strips.
Yeah there's like a downtown las vegas.
Yeah so when you would tell someone.
Especially.
You didn't speak the same languages and.
We would tell him like em gymkata cuz.
There was two mgm properties and they.
Would try to take us to the other one oh.
He would tell him coat i so you were.
Living out there for a bottom little.
Over a month right yeah pretty much like.
Six weeks we did the shows we're the.
First team to ever have residency out.
There they've never had like a team or.
An act that stayed on the show or stayed.
On the stage for that amount of time.
Right everyone's always done like.
One-off performances or like you know.
Quick show here and there and then they.
Leave but they never had one group just.
Stay so we were the first and just to.
Give background for people that might.
Not know derrick is a before he started.
Working with us editing and stuff he was.
Actually a breakdancer and you were in.
The job walking show here yeah i guess.
Yeah he's also a world-class dance.
World-class break dancers loan.
Internationally to perform they laid.
Real competent like hop top-ranked b-boy.
Yep but he don't talk about it cuz he's.
Trying to be all modest and stuff but um.
Yeah and also he's only the quietest.
People in the group extremely modest but.
He's actually very physically talented.
And can pretty much pick up anything.
Physical that he tries yeah you guys are.
Freaking kind very kind shut up honest.
Dude take a compliment just i mean that.
Was just people know yeah but it was fun.
Though i mean we're you know we did the.
Show seven shows a week we had double.
Shows so we did two shows a day.
Sometimes the crowd was like sixteen.
Hundred people the first show was.
Probably like the most nerve-racking for.
Me right because uh they want to make.
Sure the show ran smooth and i was the.
Audience they're like how did it differ.
From like i'll hear they're so different.
How so and out here in america like.
People will cheer they'll clap they'll.
Give you a standing ovation to laugh out.
There it's like it's just crickets what.
Don't they'll clap and stuff too but you.
Like almost have to tell them down.
Probably a respecting like don't.
Interrupt the performers you know yeah.
You think so even even when i saw like a.
Movie out there it was so crazy just.
Because their culture is so different um.
So at a movie theater yeah i went to a.
Movie theater and basically i sat.
Dead center of the theater and i had a.
Couple on my right-hand side and they.
Had their cell phones out with their.
Screen all the way up just like the.
Brightness yeah just their whole movie.
During the whole movie then the cup on.
My left was just having a normal.
Conversation i mean about the movie just.
Talking that's annoying.
Yeah and that was like that's just like.
The culture out there and like i end up.
Eventually getting in on my scene.
Picking a new one thinking it was gonna.
Be better but it was like the same thing.
Happening on it so you think that's just.
A cultural thing in china or in macau.
It's just a little different it's just a.
Little different i mean like even like.
Personal bubble space was different oh i.
Know that you know why do they get in.
Your face real close not on purpose.
That's just i mean yeah but yeah that's.
A culture mm-hmm like if there's room in.
An elevator like you can easily go to.
The corner but they'll just be like in.
Your face.
So the stereotype i mean i don't know if.
I should say this or not go for it you.
Know stereotype when people you see all.
All those videos i'm sure not adults i'm.
Not saying every single person but yeah.
The stereotype is there's you know.
Chinese tourists from china mm-hmm or.
Tend to be known as like kind of well in.
Our culture rude but all they're.
Actually it's not even considered rude.
It's just part of the culture yeah like.
Talking during a movie having your.
Screen brightness like it's like they.
Give us opposite of what you're saying.
It's not like they're trying to be.
Respectful and not clap for you guys cuz.
They don't care about interrupting the.
Show maybe they're not watching it.
Completely they had some you know we had.
Some good nights where like you know.
Tons of people will clap and laugh but.
We also had some bad nights too or it.
Was just dead quiet and i think.
Sometimes you got to go.
You gotta experience the bad to.
Appreciate the good right but uh but.
Yeah it's just different like when.
People when foreigners come out here and.
They do things that are culturally.
Different for us we think that they're.
Rude or yeah you know but they probably.
Think the same thing about us when we go.
Over there that's true i mean like when.
We went to japan i felt like i became a.
More polite person but i know for a fact.
That i was offending probably a lot of.
People cuz i don't we don't act the way.
They act they're extremely polite.
Everything they do is super polite and.
Like down to like i got yoda at when i.
First went out there for like a business.
Trip because i didn't accept somebody's.
Business card with two hands why if you.
If someone hands you a business card.
With two hands and.
Don't get used to hands to grab it from.
Them that's really disrespectful in.
Japan i don't know if that's like.
Anywhere else but i got yelled at about.
You when you receive it well yeah and.
When you meet them you kind of bow like.
When you say hello and stuff but yeah.
Like those little things and even like.
Just like slurping when you're eating.
Ramen and is considered polite yeah or i.
Don't know if it's polite but it's like.
A compliment to the chef yeah right so.
Like it's not like i can see both sides.
Yeah like for you know people who.
Complain about chinese tourists and you.
Know they do certain things that we can.
Are considered to be rude i guess they.
Probably see americans go to japan yeah.
You were just there i was just there.
Yeah you're one of the rudest people.
Here but you are out there especially.
For an american yeah i'm definitely out.
There but i have a i'm self aware of.
Myself a lot more now than i have been.
Before.
Right well i'm i'm aware like oh to that.
A little bit if i'm being rude yeah like.
To you guys or whatever it's a joke.
Right it's acceptable do you think is.
Not acceptable no i think it's fine.
Because we know you exactly but most.
People i think we see it from a.
Third-person perspective when you're.
Like at a restaurant or something and.
You do something you think is funny i.
Order for example what i don't know just.
Like yelling and joking with the waiter.
That who might not be having a good day.
And you're just assuming that you're.
Making their day i'm making you could be.
A waiter that's why and so like you go.
Through repetition all the time and so.
To have someone like like cuz usually.
When i joke with him it's like a.
Compliment type of thing - uh-huh.
Let me ask you this right and when you.
Introduce people to paco do you have.
Like a disclaimer to a certain degree.
Yeah depending what i mean i'm not like.
A very like oh he's different.
Mm-hmm um a lot of people say oh i met.
Paco epic oh and then when they see.
Their reaction to how they felt about.
You because of everything oh he's funny.
And it's like okay yeah i'm he's stupid.
He does dumb things but if it's like.
Yeah i met paco and they don't and they.
Stop there it's like yeah i'm sorry it's.
Like the three dots.
We don't know lady did he get naked in.
Front of you we don't know like who.
Knows what he's doing i'm predictable.
Yeah i do a lot of dumb things but.
Usually it the situation is right i'd.
Say within was it within the past year.
I'm a lot better but in the past you.
Have a lot better better when we first.
Met you you were very wild no i was i.
Was i was actually very conservative in.
The very beginning he was it was like.
That brief like when you're shy.
Yeah with entering the group funniest.
Funny story about entering that when you.
Were and entered the group.
Derek we found out like only this past.
Year when paco first came here three.
Years ago we didn't know this but derek.
Didn't like him for a year i didn't know.
That it was like two years yeah derek so.
Quiet and polite he won't say anything.
No the thing was derek was like even.
When he didn't like me he came up he's.
Like hey you want to do the show with me.
It's called wild card and i was like oh.
Cool so i was like yeah derek likes me.
He wants to do it show it me he must.
Have liked him by then what to do wild.
Card yeah i mean i guess what didn't you.
Like what didn't you like about him.
Mm-hmm it's not so much that i i don't.
Know man it's just hard question yeah it.
Is kind of a difficult question because.
I'm awesome you think to me more you.
Just think you hate me but i'm just all.
He said we nobody said they hated you.
Derek i just didn't know who you were.
I didn't know like what your intentions.
Were with the group i guess i was kind.
Of being like the protective guy of the.
Of the group you know like kinda like.
The guard dog you know i mean we've seen.
Tons of people come in the group and.
Leave the group for different reasons.
Maybe they've asked for stuff and maybe.
They wanted something like personally.
But with paco i just i had no idea with.
Him no idea what his intentions were.
Mm-hmm but i mean like over time he.
Became a cool guy but you know i did i.
Did have to make a disclaimer for him -.
Who did you talk to everyone so you're.
About to be my friend but just just he's.
Different like your disclosure mine's.
More like mine's more like crazy.
Paco he's a cool guy but he does some.
Shocking stuff so the thing is if people.
Know you it's not a big deal.
Because they know like most of time.
You're doing it as a joke yeah.
For whatever reason even if it's not.
Necessarily you know their style of.
Comedy you'll still do it yeah but but.
Also i'll do it you do things in front.
Of people sometimes that you might make.
Us laugh but they might be like well.
That's rude yeah.
They don't know you're joking yeah yeah.
But that's fine but i say my i say my.
Disclaimer not not to hate on you or.
Anything like i say it's for your sake.
Yeah yeah i know you guys looking out.
For me he's like oh he's just joking i.
Want them to experience like the good.
Side of you too you know i think i think.
Okay i'm the one that does like all this.
Crazy stuff maybe in public where it.
Could be a little bit more dangerous but.
All of us do something crazy to an.
Extent i mean within our group within.
Our most viewed groups do that though.
Yeah a lot of friend groups say things.
And do things in front of each other.
That they would never do with you know.
Out in public i'm not the only one who.
Gets naked in the group yeah well you're.
Not yeah say who it is but you.
Definitely get naked for no reason the.
Most for sure i would say and we don't.
Ask you to but it makes you guys laugh.
It's more like a shocking kind of thing.
Yeah yeah but it's like if like during.
Set you know and it's like oh man.
Everyone's like a little bit down i.
Noticed we'll make people laugh you know.
Give them a little bit that's not what i.
Am a little bit of energy i mean maybe.
It helps some of the guys hey you laugh.
Do though sometimes brightens your day.
Most the time i see him do this laugh.
You know no but he laughs after his.
Forehead a little bit rub his eyes kind.
Of like looks around in the corner i'm.
Like is this really happening yeah this.
Is gonna be over derek no see so bad.
It's not that bad i mean yes we want to.
Be unlike derek was literally almost i.
Think your opposite i think so dude.
Quiet guy who's like always like not.
Gonna say what he's thinking necessarily.
Gonna be polite and respectful yeah i.
Think it's an interesting dynamic that.
Kind of really relationship usually.
Works if you have two of you in a group.
Oh you know end up fighting yeah that's.
Annoying and they end up trying to top.
Each other and it becomes competitive.
Yeah i don't know if there's other.
Friend groups out there that have that.
Usually friend groups have like one guy.
Like that mmm but also my experience is.
Idea of two people who are like that.
They have to have like a good.
Understanding of each other in a.
Relationship where that it isn't too.
Much of a competition you know when to.
Stop cuz there are there are very few.
People who can do that that is true yeah.
You know what though on based on.
Entertainment you're the character.
People like though cuz you're like the.
Not at first.
Well you're like the naruto basically.
Sorry not at all i say right i didn't.
Understand recent i wrote oh dude he's.
Like the crazy guy who's like that does.
Things that people might shake their.
Head at mmm but that's like funny to.
People you're like the ralph from.
Simpsons there you go yeah i don't know.
Who that is but it's a guy that picks.
His nose okay all right you also should.
Give disclaimer for derek derek is a.
He's a troll he is a troll.
Yeah let's miss derek now no he's not.
It's not really a dislike derek time.
He'll pretend to be more confused and.
Confusing than he really is mm-hmm i.
Think and it's not for see i do things.
Usually to make you guys laugh derek.
Does things to make himself laugh oh i'm.
Gonna turn on the ac okay i got it.
Laughs man did what why why do you do.
That though is it is it purely just for.
Your own entertainment sometimes and.
You're just like dude this is i'm gonna.
Make me laugh mmm.
Sure yeah for sure i mean you know i.
Don't even do it on purpose i just.
Naturally do it you know what i mean.
Do you think he doesn't i think it's.
What i think it's your upbringing it.
Right you said your dad does that to you.
Yeah my dad and my dad likes to joke a.
Lot too maybe that's where i get it from.
But i don't know i mean i just i just.
Talk man i just do mean do you this that.
Great nothing crazy man that is true.
Derek just does derek regardless of.
Who's around so and how about you ryan.
What mmm what whoever disclaimers oh you.
Have a disclaimer for ryan i have a.
Disclaimer for ryan.
And it's i'm gonna is basically adding.
On to what david and arden said mmm-hmm.
So whenever people are like hey man do.
You think brian would want to come out.
To this event or to this party or.
Something like we're trying to push this.
Thing and be real cool.
I don't know ryan's in vegas it'd be.
Real dope my thing is is if you get him.
Out of that house that's amazing so.
That's that's shit-talking that's i'm.
Doing my disclaim we're doing our.
Disclaimer to help so that when they.
Meet you they're not like oh i should be.
Offended yeah for saying this guy does.
Not like people he stays home and he.
Does not want to meet you oh you want to.
Take it in that they're saying no.
There's been a lot of times where we've.
Had paco say like something crazy.
Outlandish about ryan that ryan's never.
Said before to other people like what.
There's a lot of times hmm where i i.
Mean it's it's just happened so often.
I'm just like what did i say that or.
What did i do that.
And i'm just like and then you wouldn't.
Go would you okay yeah but i wouldn't.
Tell it to them i'm being honest man.
That's not necessarily being honest.
Sometimes shooting yourself down this.
Became a therapy session hey you know.
What every episode i mean is a therapy.
Session i know but it's fun they're a.
Piece of gator we could all have therapy.
I mean there's there's no um you should.
Be a stigma on that oh is there a flare.
Up piece enos of the week not bad come.
On don't owe me thinking it was a penis.
Thing actually like therapy's actually i.
Think is really helpful because i i had.
A heart-to-heart talk with you yesterday.
And it's actually like really good to.
Just air out everything rather than like.
We did that in private yeah but now you.
Can tell the podcast in the world like.
Why you bring that up are you gonna tell.
Us i mean we you know like i've just.
Been going through some rough times and.
Off-camera like i may i may look like.
Pretty sad and stuff on camera but off.
Camera i really got to talk to ryan.
About some personal stuff that's.
Happening in my life and yeah it was it.
Was really good to air it out and you.
Gave me some like helpful information.
And direction and just advice that i.
Feel as i.
I need to hear so and that's good i.
Don't want to pry if it's too private.
You know but i guess for viewers that it.
Could be going through something similar.
You you know maybe you can give them.
Like some general advice that would you.
Guys spoke about you know if you don't.
Feel comfortable talking just bring up.
To the point that you want to talk about.
It i mean to summon up i'm basically.
Going through a breakup and you know.
It's real tough you know coming out from.
A long relationship and i just you know.
I felt lost i felt confused felt like.
Inadequate and this guy over here just.
Like really like instilled some some.
Good words back into me and i think if.
Anyone is having like some similar.
Trouble like that it's probably best.
That's turned your friends and talked to.
Each other rather than just holding it.
In because those thoughts can go deeper.
And deeper and deeper and that stuff can.
Manifest into something like real.
Negative well i think the reason why i.
Even said anything is because i mean we.
Could i mean i could see it that there.
Was like something bothering you and.
Then i'm like you and that i like to.
Hold in my own feeling like i'm like i'm.
Not gonna bother someone else yes and.
Like it's not gonna help me you know.
Even though it does it does help even if.
You're like me or derek where you just.
Don't like to talk about your feelings.
And i don't know that's a bringing thing.
Or just personality thing but it's.
Literally the opposite of some like paco.
It when you have issues you literally.
Hey can we talk yeah like i would never.
Say that derek would never say that you.
Know but unless i unless i go to him or.
You know vice versa and i feel that i.
Feel that like like of course i'm going.
Through some stuff and like in my head.
What's the point in calling someone else.
Too everyone's got their own problems.
You know like why would i want to bring.
My problems on to someone else or yeah.
But it was actually really helpful to.
Just kind of like talk it through right.
So i would recommend that yeah yeah and.
I think from my perspective because.
We're very different like you guys said.
The reason why i bring up my problems.
Because i know other people have.
Different perspectives and that they.
Have a view that you know maybe could.
Show me oh i didn't consider this you.
Know maybe you know and sometimes we get.
Too caught up in our own thoughts and we.
Overthink situations and we start going.
Down a 10.
That's like not even logical or possible.
But it's because we're so consumed in.
This that having someone else from an.
Outside view speaking to our lives.
Especially someone who cares about us.
And will be real with us and not.
Sugarcoat it like that that's always.
Helpful and that's what i think and.
That's why i like i appreciate you guys.
Well i think the number one thing that.
We came to as a conclusion yesterday and.
I don't i don't mean without having to.
Say too much you can talk about it if.
You want but i think the number one.
Thing that i think i learned not.
Yesterday would i was telling you and i.
Think i told you too in the in the past.
But it was that it's okay to feel shitty.
Like you should feel shitty because we.
Were i mean we were talking over like a.
Couple of drinks and i was just worried.
Like i've seen people when they go.
Through that kind of stuff they you know.
Whether they smoke or they drink or they.
Do whatever they can to kind of escape.
It but it's not you're not really.
Escaping anything like you're just.
Putting it off and it's gonna let it.
Build yeah like it's just gonna get.
Worse and worse and worse and the worse.
It gets the more you drink your smoke to.
Cover it up and it just keeps building.
It's not going anywhere.
You might feel fine because you're high.
Or you're drunk but it's it's just.
Building so at some point you got to.
Face it and you're if you let it build.
More it's just gonna be worse later down.
The road yeah that's the way i see it at.
Least and i think it's okay to just like.
Like you should be feeling like.
Like don't try and like avoid it because.
You got a face at some point yeah yeah.
One thing i learned over in china was.
Actually like something that i the whole.
China trip felt like fate to me with the.
Conversations i had with people and the.
Things that i learned and one of the.
Things i learned over there was that.
Like you know i was taught like a 10 a.
10 rule 10 rule a week kind of thing.
Which is uh if you have like a lot of.
Stresses in your life you have like a.
Lot of depression or issues that you're.
Going through like you know try to.
Maximize that to ten and what do you.
Think is really worth that effort to.
Stress over so for example if you're.
Stress about money you're stressed about.
Like you know your situation your living.
Situation that's already two things you.
Know and you only have eight left and if.
You give that a week you know you could.
Pile on a lot of things in in a list of.
Ten you know so what really deserves.
Your time.
What really deserves like your energy to.
Really feel negative about something.
So you're saying like the you only have.
The capacity to care about ten things is.
That what you're saying yeah and those.
10 things should be very valuable like.
It should really be something that makes.
That list rather than like you know.
There's tons of little things that.
People are always stressed about you.
Know yeah finance.
I don't know social media the right.
Shoes i don't know you know like.
Everyone's got their own problems but is.
It really worth like to make artists.
Smart where did you hear that from like.
It sounds like a therapist john it was.
Actually from a girl that i met out.
There and she told me like you know.
That's how she copes with stuff she also.
Told me like you know she has like this.
Five year rule or something like that.
Where if something is not gonna affect.
You in five years and you shouldn't put.
That much effort into it i was like.
That's pretty interesting either.
Something's not gonna i've never really.
Thought of it like that so it was it was.
Kind of cool to hear your different.
Perspectives kind of like how you said.
You know yeah yeah and i i think just.
Where the sake of it that for the.
Disclaimer and everything like just.
Because you're going through a breakup.
And everything doesn't mean you have any.
Ill-will towards eric alright like oh no.
Yeah i think that's something we should.
Bring up yeah i would never like wish.
Anything bad upon her we've had you know.
We've had a good relationship and i.
Don't want nobody to tweet negative.
Things to her right bad comments we you.
Know we had a clean break up is just.
Tough yeah yeah yeah such a long time.
Too.
Yeah and if you like respect like derek.
And and erica or even just derek or.
Whatever or ryan guys like you would not.
Go after you know someone like that.
Especially if you still like care about.
Them she's a friendship yeah for sure.
We're definitely friends i mean we still.
Talk sometimes we have lunch you know.
It's just it's just a different page now.
Which is okay yeah yeah yeah i went we.
Went deep therapy session we did i mean.
Early into the podcast how was it for.
You when you made that video you know.
You made a video on your youtube channel.
About a breakup did that help.
It uh it helped me a lot and i'm very.
Lucky that you know i didn't come out.
With my relationship and see like who it.
Was and stuff and show but it was very.
Therapeutic to me because like you guys.
Said i'm somebody who like really i'm.
Very i wear my heart on my sleeve i'm.
Very.
You know i'm not soft though but uh like.
You're pretty soft i mean you're like a.
Definitely more emotional than both of.
Us i think you're like the most common.
Toilet paper yeah the most emotional.
Person in the group.
Sure one person who's spoken to my life.
A lot every instagram picture i post.
Since that podcast he puts toilet paper.
Emojis soft who this guy collide that's.
Funny yeah that's um but it helped me a.
Lot because it got me to i guess be.
Transparent with who i am and say like.
This is the mistakes i made this is how.
I was viewing a life and her and clearly.
I was i had a lot of clouded judgment i.
Was infatuated and it was kind of just.
Like because it's something that.
Everybody goes through everybody goes.
Through that like that first.
Relationship or you know one of the.
First ones and it just does not go well.
And everyone has to go through that but.
A lot of times people will be like all.
This first relationship was suppose to.
Be everything they over romanticize it.
Is all my fault and for me i felt that.
Way too but i also learned things from.
It and i was like this is like not just.
The advice that i have to give but it's.
Kind of advice that you all like pour it.
Into me and like spoken to me you know.
So in a way i was just like.
Regurgitating a lot of things that you.
Guys have told me she basically stole my.
Video then and like our videos and yeah.
Oh okay good and i made money off of it.
So that's nice nice student someone is.

Derek is one of those hardcore marvel.
Errs what do you call yourselves marvel.
Errs.
Yeah marvelous oh really he's all those.
People who watches like every single one.
When it comes right in theaters when it.
Comes out and whether even he he'll go.
By himself.
And watch it.
And you know i've seen some i mean i.
Would say about 50%.
Paco's seen one movie one just iron man.
Iron man and it's funny because we're.
All coming at you from perspective i'm.
Kind of excited i know you're you could.
Care less yeah absolutely careless and.
Then derek you're just hyped because.
It's the last one right oh i mean it's.
Not gonna be the last avengers ever game.
Cuz they're like that that letter that.
Was on twitter and everything did you.
Guys see that letter yeah no yeah so.
Basically are the directors right you.
Talk about it since you're the fan i.
Mean it was more so than actors you know.
Their contracts are coming to an end.
They've done the character for like 10.
Plus years you know they're also uh you.
Know who knows where they're gonna take.
The storyline i don't i don't know since.
We haven't seen the movie yet but who.
Knows like iron man could be finished.
Captain moore uh captain america could.
Be finished who knows you know maybe the.
Originals are done but i know that.
Avengers will still live on through like.
Spider-man and like the other characters.
Like bucky or whoever you know right.
Like panther basically also the twitter.
Letter was saying like that their.
Journey has come to an end and like you.
Know every all the hard work that.
Everybody's put in like don't spoil it.
Like don't be one of those douchebags.
That spoil things.
I suck yeah yeah i mean just just like.
The game of thrones just premiered yeah.
And that's like i took a meme in itself.
Like oh if you spoil like i've seen more.
On those in actual spoilers mm-hmm like.
Of people putting like well if you spoil.
This you're and then it's like a picture.
Of someone dead or you know yeah.
Something something like that yeah.
People really eight spoilers i mean i.
Can relate to it there's a reason why i.
Didn't watch the what was it there's a.
Big thing oh oh the um the firt the.
Avengers that uh the most recent one.
That came up oh yeah with thanos so i.
Saw that only when it came on netflix so.
We're gonna watch it in in theaters but.
I knew the ending i was like okay well.
Something happens and there's a meme and.
People disintegrate or something like.
That's no boilers dude i don't get to.
See it if okay here's my thing if you.
Haven't seen it by the time it's out of.
Theaters that is your problem like for.
Real like if people do that about naruto.
And when that was like coming out live.
And like people would get mad because i.
Would talk about stuff they came out.
Like maybe about like a month or two.
I'm like well if you're not gonna like.
If you're not gonna keep up then you.
Don't really care that much and that's.
How i felt - i didn't care that i knew.
The ending but i didn't go watch it no.
It was on netflix yeah manatee war was.
Dope they packed like tons of different.
Storylines and characters into one movie.
That was just like just blew your mind.
You know like they've been doing this.
What for a long time like over a decade.
You know just planting seeds and letting.
It letting it grow watering in and.
Getting everyone together it's just it's.
A dope movie marvel knows what's up see.
So i have always been like excited that.
It i was excited because i thought i was.
Coming to an end not because i don't.
Like those movies but because it's like.
Oh all these talented actors and.
Talented like screenwriters and all.
These people putting all this i feel.
Like every movie that comes out these.
Days are like a recreation of something.
There's nothing really original anymore.
That does box office like records other.
Than stuff that like jordan peele is.
Doing with gale you know yeah what does.
The recent one us yes yeah he's only.
Part like i mean there's there's some.
Others too that are doing original stuff.
But everything else like oh they're.
Making a live-action disney movie yeah.
They're doing omar because they know it.
Makes money yeah but like i just miss.
The days when like you miss them every.
Yeah there was like something original.
Oh that's a unique idea or it's like.
Kind of like this but it's kind of.
Unique it's not just a recreation of.
Something that's already been told so.
Who do you blame you blame the studio's.
You blame like audience retention it's.
Both pretend it's it's the audience it's.
Our fault for buying into it like it of.
Course the studio's gonna make what they.
Want to make right yeah but it is also i.
Think the studios because they decide.
Who they're gonna fund there's tons of.
Talented writers and scripts constantly.
Being you know i'm sure pitch to these.
Studios but why would they make those.
Movies and take the risk of putting in.
All this money for something that they.
Don't know how it's gonna do verse make.
Something that's already has a proven.
Fan base and for sure milk the benefits.
You know it's have to say it's a studio.
It's just money billions yeah but it's.
Like money kills creation like.
Creativity for sure i think for the most.
Part it's anything for it with youtube.
Like that's what happened to you too.
Because people like a formula like they.
Like knowing what's gonna happen when.
Money gets involved yes yeah i mean.
That's.
Yeah you know yeah so yeah i was excited.
That it was coming to me for that reason.
But i guess it's not i mean i'm excited.
Yeah i want to know what happens yeah -.
Thank you i already got my movie tickets.
For days yeah - yeah seriously yeah i.
Got my movie ticket for the premiere and.
Then i bought another movie ticket so.
For imax are you going to the one here.
Is there one here in vegas yeah yeah.
It's premiering everywhere oh so i mean.
Like every city has their own premiere.
Well i mean like i just bought a movie.
Ticket to regular tea and your skies.
When you say premiere i was thinking.
Like red carpet and oh heck no oh sorry.
My bed oh no no i was just i'm not i'm.
Not cool like that.
All right well um on that note i didn't.
Know we were already at that point but.
We have to take a shishi break so uh.
We'll be right back we'll be right back.
Why did i snap thanos half of us can go.
Shoo birdy.
And we're back that was louder than.
Usual was it yeah usually and you're.
Still eating oh.
Make it loud slurping noise i guess we.
Didn't give you enough time or hmm okay.
So do we should we just wait for you or.
Like are you good now we can start okay.
I guess and and now we're back so what.
Else we got on the agenda today um that.
Derek can't bring it up still on the.
Avengers nay i can't believe he did that.
To the world do you like yeah okay so.
The one thing i did like about avengers.
That infinity war it's very similar and.
I tweeted something like just as a joke.
That it's so similar to like a lot of.
The villains in naruto naruto just for.
The people who get mad at me for seeing.
It wrong right i'll fight you i'm from.
America okay that's how i speak actually.
You're from now retail i'm from hawaii.
Gets america yeah a lot of people don't.
Think so but the thing i like about that.
Thanos and the villains that they have.
Um you know in like art or other a lot.
Of enemies actually they actually.
Believe that they're doing good for the.
World.
Mm-hmm like it's actually like thallus.
Is like as much as he did like horrible.
Things like he destroyed half the world.
Right population wise it was out of in.
His mind mercy right and he actually i.
Mean it's kind of like a not an analogy.
But it's kind of like the whole it's.
Very much so related to the thought.
Behind like the conspiracy theory or on.
The illuminati in the new world order.
But like this world is being too.
Overpopulated we're all gonna suffer at.
Some point because you're gonna run out.
Of resources so if you were to reduce.
The population right scientific i mean.
This is not saying that i agree with.
This or that we should do this but what.
They're saying is if you reduce a.
Population it's actually mercy on the.
People like the human race will still.
Survive cuz at the rate that we're.
Growing everyone's gonna die mm-hmm huh.
What are your thoughts on that i think i.
Think you should happen you think half.
The world should be but no not.
Necessarily half the world but i don't.
Think start to be we should die i think.
People who type that's a hot take i.
Think people type first on youtube.
Videos and dislike videos even before.
They watch the whole thing should die um.
I think so we were trying to make a.
Serious conversation when you're just.
Naming people that annoy you.
I think people annoying me should die i.
Think people who i don't know i'm not.
Someone to be like you know oh these.
People should die just think like there.
Are ways that we can go about making.
Sure everybody's okay cuz you guys heard.
About the whole like uh no no turd on.
The yeah the fire yeah right and it did.
Like i think couple millions it's not.
Billion dollars of damage to it and.
People are donating money to get it.
Fixed already but a lot of a lot of.
Catholic people feel like why are we.
Donating money to a building when we all.
That money that we're spending could be.
Used like feeding homeless people or.
Helping people who have been through.
Naturally so i mean like that yeah and.
How rich the church actually is ready.
Like they could easily afford to build.
It back but if you think about it it's.
It's cuz it was covered in the news.
Right uh-huh.
Like.
And so people feel so distraught by it.
Because it's like a monument is a symbol.
Yeah it's a symbol but so it's like if.
They were covering like this huge event.
That happened to kids you know starving.
Recently if it was just a news thing.
Like something that was just on the news.
Mainstream media everywhere like in the.
Same way that that fire was covered.
Something kids are always starving but.
If there was some big event where all of.
A sudden tons of kids were being covered.
On the news for starving i guarantee you.
That same thing would happen yeah it's.
Just a matter of people get take action.
When they're emotional ah majora not.
Everyone some people actually help.
Because of you know they they really.
Care about what's happening yeah but.
Some people are just going based off.
Emotion like oh my god this is awful i.
Need to do something which is a good.
Thing like it's a good thing to feel.
That way but that brings me to my point.
Like they're only caring about that.
Cause because it's covered in the news.
So much i mean that's why i think but i.
Mean you're i was just talking about the.
Aspect they're like we could not have to.
Kill and necessarily a bunch of people.
We could just figure out how to solve.
That issue in a different way because we.
Do have like a lot of resources that.
Could help that out well tell that to.
Thanos maybe maybe people can like stop.
Eating meat like they could stop eating.
Me and like start eating like more.
Greens i mean that is that that i know.
What you're talking about yeah but it's.
Not are you are you gonna actually stop.
Eating meat derek they should call.
Themselves vegans.
There's vegetarians yeah i mean well i.
Mean what he's talking about.
I think is another solution but what.
We're talking about is an alternative.
Like for coming from what you're saying.
From the thanos perspective right i'm.
Giving an analogy why did he if he would.
That gauntlet thing i don't know what.
Does it have you can do anything with it.
Right pretty much she's got some stones.
So instead of killing half the world why.
Didn't he just create a second world or.
The population yeah or if here you live.
Here everyone lives or he snaps and just.
Doubles the food he doesn't what end the.
Land yeah we need right why could i do.
That he doesn't work like that man why.
Why it so he is evil the net that.
Defeats my first point like he's not.
Doing it for pr see ant-man should go in.
His butthole and explode him nina.
Mmm danish theory yeah i mean in his.
Storyline like he's doing that for years.
Like going to galaxies and just like.
Wiping out half of it already to help.
Him it's c but it's not really he'll.
Like if you have that kind of power you.
Don't need to kill half the world right.
You could just if you can have if you're.
Like a guy why not just create like you.
Said more resource or maybe when he.
Snaps he's sending them to another world.
And that world has enough resources for.
Everybody.
Man maybe we misjudge stano's i mean.
Yeah i would see it actually that one if.
It's the last one i'll see it yeah but.
It's three hours long holy.
I know it's types like titanic though i.
Know i don't think i could sit through.
That now but titanic had some nipples.
And that was i remember that i was a.
Little kid my nipples in avengers.
There's tons of nipples and avengers.
Girl nipples though mmm yeah now you're.
Talking game of thrones you don't watch.
That i have seen i watched a little bit.
Of game of thrones acts pretty much.
Anything that's mainstream and people.
Like you don't really know not.
Necessarily is i i just like video games.
A lot i know but enough time for that.
Stuff i watch james i watched game of.
Thrones man it's not so bad but i watch.
Game of thrones with his girl who i.
Liked i know you're already laughing.
Look at that what but and then when we.
Kind of like stop talking i'm somebody.
Who associate stuff that i do with.
People with them you know so i can't.
Watch game of thrones without thinking.
About her i mean we're cool now and.
Everything but back then i was like well.
I can't watch this anymore because then.
I just feel sad it's so emotional yeah.
Poor guy hmm you what you want to watch.
Game of thrones with me you gonna break.
My heart.
Probably then oh yeah i got asked to.
Watch the game of thrones that season.
Premiere one huh and and then and then i.
Got an ass.
What do you mean uninvited yeah i got.
Asked to go watch it and then we went on.
Me my friend we went to trader joe's and.
Bought hello snacks cookies and freakin.
Some water and some like ice creams to.
Bring to the party yeah and then and.
Then it.
Didn't work out and they told you not to.
Come she was just like is this is my.
Friend he's cool and she's like well i.
Don't really like the homegirl it was i.
Don't really want like a random guy to.
Come to my house she was just inviting.
You.
Yeah you think he was about to have his.
Own game of thrones love story.
Damn okay cock-blocked yourself no no i.
Didn't she the friend just didn't want.
Me to come over cuz we never never met.
Oh so it's a her thing.
I'm probably just like a random guy no.
Not tinder but there's some kind of.
Acquaintances yeah yeah friend all right.
Did you have any game of thrones love.
Stories in china well i never seen game.
Of thrones so what does that mo did i.
Have she make love with your sibling.
Yeah see you know you know what do you.
Say.
I didn't hear which is yep insist oh.
Yeah you know what that was about no i.
Mean the thing about game of thrones and.
Always made me wonder too cuz you know.
Back in the day wasn't the whole idea of.
Like being royal and you know keeping it.
Within the bloodline yeah aren't they.
All product of incest yeah technically.
Aren't we all.
It's in some way i guess it depends on.
Your religion yeah but but yeah i mean.
It's like in the whole like the.
Christian thing or whatever right cuz.
Then it's like it starts up at the top.
Of the tree there's adam and eve and.
They are they related then no they're.
Not related but still like you know.
Where do they make how do they make how.
Do their babies make babies yeah there's.
No there cuz no they're siblings right.
Yeah yeah well now we know let's talk.
About the season the hell up bad about.
Christianity okay i should not even as a.
Joke sorry to my christians out there.
That's we we're digging ourselves a hole.
Right now and man's gonna jump in and.
Explode us there you go.
And that's kind of funny though that we.
Can even like not that i said the joke.
But we can even like talk about it.
Because if this was another religion.
Specifically like something in the news.
Yeah i was talking about like muslims.
Uh-huh we were seeing someone about that.
We'd be in way more hot water.
Oh yeah christianity is like so popular.
Here that we can make fun of because.
It's always like punching up as.
You're bunching up it's okay sure that's.
Why like you know black people like when.
They do comedies that they can make fun.
Of white people true sure what a white.
Person can't make fun of of yashin or.
Even an asian really yeah yeah yeah that.
Makes me think where do we fall on the.
Chart we're kind of like below white.
Above or below black do you think so.
Yeah i think so.
Because i feel like a asian couldn't.
Make fun of a black person for being.
Black no we can that person could make.
Fun of an asian for being i think i.
Think it's kind of like similar levels.
Yeah it's pretty close i think it's.
Close yeah no i was just thinking about.
That sorry random tangent it's tough to.
Say you look like you were trying gonna.
Say something derrick i mean it's just.
My opinion.
Asians don't really get casted that much.
To be lead role son true though true i.
Don't know where they stand on the on.
The food chart but the food is.
Definitely on the lower and i would.
Think yeah yeah that's true but i mean.
Like like i said in a previous video.
Like steve harvey making fun of asians.
And it cost him his career mm-hmm but if.
You've seen like an asian guy make you.
Know fun of black people for being black.
And singing by people are undateable.
Then that guy's career is probably done.
What did you think an asian guy's saying.
That i don't actually see more asian.
People do this self-deprecating thing.
Where they make fun of how like asian.
Guys yeah but i'm saying i know they're.
Made i know i think we're i think we're.
Still punching up though but they don't.
But asian guy can't make fun of a black.
Person yeah for being black but i think.
Also it's because like black people have.
Kind of taken like though we get to make.
The race jokes it's everything because.
They've been so proficient in it they're.
Very good at it they're very good at.
Their jokes that is true yeah i'm just.
Trying to figure out the totem pole.
They're just very observant and they.
Know how to make it fun right but then.
Where does that leave everybody else.
Struggling we got to talk about politics.
And stuff okay well i somehow we we went.
From avengers to like penis of the week.
The week see we got back that we didn't.
Do that in a while we haven't yeah yeah.
But now we're back i started.
So anyways in china yeah what about game.
Of thrones any any good love stories you.
Had uh yeah i met some people out there.
It was definitely some fun interesting.
Experiences and did you know some people.
Just listening derek just smiling the.
Whole time.
Music.
I love living through derek man cuz.
There's way hotter and like sexier than.
Me and stuff and he's just like he.
Always does cool stuff with like very.
Pretty girls some house like hey derek.
What happened but they're all down plays.
Everything you know cuz he's very humble.
And stuff so he's like you know he's.
Hung out and kick it as like just hung.
Out and kick it and it takes like 15 to.
40 minutes to get him to say like he's.
Cuz you're asking him like that maybe.
Yeah i'm kind of creepy.
Yeah i wouldn't want to tell you.
Anything either if you're asking me like.
That it's alright you kiss already like.
Ignoring you yeah you know what is a i.
Guess for you was the most fun thing you.
Did in china though probably just meet.
People just meet different people around.
The world experience different.
Situations and stuff out there compared.
To here performing again was was amazing.
That felt really good but you guys went.
To china together before and that sounds.
Like a completely different situation.
Yeah i was yeah we went to beijing yeah.
We met and it was i'm not gonna lie it.
Was not a fun experience i was one of my.
Least favorite trips and it was uh not.
No it's not not because of derek it was.
Um.
We none of what i mean derek's chinese.
Right yeah but it's just the trip was.
Rough for one every place we went.
Because we couldn't speak chinese we.
Didn't have somebody like normally when.
We go out for events people accompanying.
Us thick tape set us up with like a.
Local or somebody we had no one so we're.
On our own for one just getting a taxi.
To go somewhere that we needed to be was.
A struggle because if we don't have.
Somebody telling us this they're.
Constantly we didn't know this at the.
Time but they constitute our to rip you.
Off like it's not like hey this is the.
Set rate yeah they try and negotiate.
With you and we're like what it only.
Costs us like i don't know what the.
Currency was like 40 bucks to get there.
Why are you saying it's gonna and we're.
In the middle of nowhere right because.
We don't know where we are.
Why are you gonna charge us like a.
Hundred bucks to go back like how was it.
Gonna cost that much more and then we.
Found out like oh you have to negotiate.
Or you can negotiate and i think they.
Knew that we couldn't speak chinese so.
Like yeah he texted her we were talking.
To you because there's a line of them.
Just kept telling people to skip us oh.
Yeah so we were like stranded there with.
This one guy and note we couldn't go to.
Any other taxi driver so we ended up.
Having to walk like hella far to get.
Home taxi yeah and even that taxi was.
Like where's your hotel we would say the.
Name and he wouldn't know like yeah.
Where that was and we didn't know if.
We're being scammed again so we end up.
Getting dropped off in the middle of.
This like downtown area yeah and we had.
To just walk and look for it like on.
Google matt we are phones don't really.
Work ray can't call anyone yeah we we.
Saw like a map on the street no wi-fi.
Yeah and we just kind of like this looks.
Like something familiar yeah kind of.
Like that friends episode you put the.
Map down you stand and yes i didn't have.
A good experience but apparently macao.
Is like the opposite of that.
Well yeah where i was at it was.
Definitely like the las vegas strip or.
It was a las vegas strip some of they.
Had some of the same hotels from here.
Out there and you said it's like there.
Because whatever what i've heard is that.
Bad place is like stacked with cash like.
Oh yeah hell of money they told me that.
Um macau is richer than dubai and they.
Told me that the ratio from las vegas to.
Macau is one to seven so any time an.
American spends a hundred bucks out here.
Someone in macau is spending seven.
Hundred equal vient to that damn yeah.
It's pretty crazy yeah.
Do they bet on fights and stuff like.
Even watch that stuff i didn't see too.
Much sports betting i saw just a lot of.
Table games mmm a lot of table games.
Yeah that is true and just crazy too.
Rich asians like it's like a whole.
Nother level of wealth yeah in china it.
Is yeah you know yeah there's weather.
That's why they're taking over that is.
Did you know that yeah i know i know.
That we owe them like hella money we.
Need to learn which one is in mandarin.
Or manners man yeah i think it's which.
One's cantonese then is that in taiwan.
No cantonese.
In hong kong hong kong yeah i know i'm.
Being careful cuz i know that people get.
Really offended yeah i like i'm going to.
Hong kong.
Okay what was it when we when i went out.
There i met up with this i'm in it with.
A couple people out there i meant this.
Like super rich poker player that i does.
Just play poker and that's like his life.
Out there.
We and again like a table and a couple.
Bottles and stuff and just partying all.
Night i met this other guy who was super.
Rich and he picked me up in his porsche.
And he took me to some really dope local.
Spots where i ate some really good food.
Took mia's really dope desert spot some.
Like touristy kind of local attraction.
Spots and then the end the night when he.
Was dropping me off we parked in this.
Parking lot and i smashed his porsche.
Door into another car door and i felt so.
Bad he looked at me and i don't even.
Know why i reacted this way but once i.
Open the door went bing.
He looked at me and i immediately closed.
My door like i didn't even do it.
I don't know why i did it that way i.
Yeah i don't know why but i just like.
What do you say he just kind of like.
Chuckled and i'm just like i'm sorry do.
Like it was a complete accident like if.
You want me to fix your chip or your.
Pain i'll i'll go get a sharpie from the.
Concierge phikul you answer i'll get a.
Sharpie and color it in or something.
Damn but now he didn't mind i mean he.
Was he one of those crazy rich people.
Are just pretty rich crazy rich asian.
Yeah dang that level of that level of.
Money it's just like such a like there's.
Rich people yeah then there is that you.
Know that's what that movie is about.
It's like a whole nother level of.
Richness it's like everybody a bunch of.
Like bill gates out there like rich and.
Then your wealth yeah yeah yeah but i.
Felt bad i felt really bad because he.
Gave me such like a cool day like you.
Know like kicking it with the local and.
Stuff and showed me around town just.
Getting out of the hotel or off the.
Stage and then i freaking ding his door.
It was it was a bad feeling i mean i.
Know most people like they think that's.
The dream right to have that level of.
Wealth yeah but like i would never i.
Don't think i would ever want to live a.
Life where i'm that rich like.
In the billions i really don't think.
That would be you you're not you're not.
The same part in the same way like i.
Would never want to be like justin.
Bieber famous yeah or like at that level.
Mmm because at that point you can't live.
A regular like some people might enjoy.
It some people do fine with it but.
There's a reason why a lot of those.
People who have everything still kill.
Themselves they're still like depressed.
Yeah because you can't live it's a whole.
Nother way of living you got to change.
Your whole mindset everything and you're.
Almost it's almost like you're couldn't.
Find to certain areas in a way because.
You lose your freedom yes you're too.
Famous right and and just being that.
Rich to everybody you meet is gonna.
Treat you differently yeah for one you.
Can't trust almost anyone that's true.
Not even family at that point right on.
Time yeah yeah for the most part usually.
It is that way um unless you're just.
Born into it and everyone around you is.
Rich i think a lot of times it's you.
Can't trust anyone because there's such.
A big it's such a powerful thing and i.
Don't i don't think i would ever wanna.
Live that life i think you for like a.
Day i like a week yeah i think i saw um.
I could be wrong but somebody who.
Recently like won the lotto like had a.
Mask on right so nobody would like their.
Family wouldn't know that they're rich.
You know cuz like what you know it's.
Hard to turn down family and it will.
Change everything it would change.
Everything if you have the nicest family.
Members they know they know like oh you.
Didn't even we got dinner and you're not.
Gonna pick up the bill yeah like it's.
Just a hundred two hundred bucks like.
What is that to you like it just because.
It changes the dynamic between people.
And i know that i mean like even i've.
Met like hundreds of millionaires.
Billionaires and i feel different around.
Them like oh i know they feel different.
Like i'm already thinking like how do i.
Act because this is like a different.
Level and it's hard to even treat them.
Like a human being sometimes yeah even.
Though you know i know i should i know.
What they're thinking like they have.
Like a trust issue thing and yeah i.
Don't know like i think that's an.
Interesting dynamic uh and i think a lot.

Dude i mean i've been trying to well i'm.
Not trying i haven't been i just thought.
About growing it out okay and then i'd.
Also thought about shaving it because.
Paco made fun of me before you came.
Really what do you say hey mimi low self.
Conscious but he's like not like he was.
With his friend and they came over.
Earlier before you got here and he was.
Like oh can you take a picture of my.
Friends like oh oh yeah i guess i.
Couldn't say oh you're not gonna shave.
It was even before that you said oh.
You're gonna really grow it out like why.
Who are you trying to appeal to like.
What dumb are you trying to appeal to.
Cuz you can't even with all those.
Patches oh like i was like yeah i get a.
Roasted first thing in the morning when.
I see to it there's context to it.
Oh shaver picture no because so whenever.
I ask him to be in my videos yeah if i.
Don't let him know in advance and i ask.
Him day of and he did his shave he's.
Like aw do you shoulda let me know.
Before so i could have shaved.
Okay so every time i ask him he's always.
Like i should have shaved so when he did.
It she only do that's why yeah i was.
Like oh you're not gonna shave dude and.
Then mmm that was he's trying to make.
Himself some no making fun of me like i.
Think i'd maybe i should shave that's.
Right at first was like you're not gonna.
Shave he's like i'm thinking about.
Growing out and then i went to get host.
And then he was like oh yeah but you got.
All those patches like you know cuz i've.
Talked about it like i can't grow full.
Beer no sir.
Yeah but maybe if i grow it long enough.
At all like cover up the spaces yeah but.
He just really didn't want me to do it.
Dude saying things like well what damn.
Waiter can't you like your fans are.
Gonna like that and i was like you're.
Right no but that's our friendship man.
It's always like roast each other's.
Stuff i mean the patches look cool bro.
Thanks to you yeah it makes you unique.
Yeah it gives me like some error over.
Here why you so mad dude i thought that.
You know if you shave it more i think.
This is a myth when people say they.
Shave it supposed to grow back thicker.
It doesn't work i shaved this i let grow.
And shave all the time hoping i'm gonna.
Fill these patches one day and it just.
Doesn't work dude i know how sean did it.
And you're egging on well gregan will.
Have always hey that's true actually but.
You can't grow a beard huh that's a girl.
Any hair anywhere the three of us can't.
The three of them can their real hair.
It's just patchy yeah it doesn't look.
Good you guys can't grow hair and i.
Think that's like almost a blessing.
That's you don't have to shave as much.
Or i'll have to shave cuz then mine will.
Come out real quick and then chill there.
For like a little bit what like like.
Mustache hair would like come out like.
The next day oh yeah well then just stay.
That length for like five days right.
Like this people who are listening they.
Can't see it's like stubble that is not.
In every spot so it looks stupid but if.
It was filled out it would look you know.
It look doh but to start it off you have.
To start from somewhere i know i know.
Sochi it's a life lesson for people emo.
Is like even like when you're growing.
Out your hair there's that phase where.
You look like an idiot and you will look.
Like an idiot but if you commit to.
Something you you might still look like.
An idiot but at leaders a chance you.
Might not yeah people respect you a.
Little bit anyways you have chess here.
Though yeah i i do but it's like even.
That it's not like a like how you see on.
Like a movie yeah like that like an.
Actor who has like nice like i don't.
Know it's just like still it's like my.
Face is sporadic yeah and it's just like.
I could easily just wax it and it'd be.
Gone and like a you know it wouldn't be.
Like a steve carell situation i got.
Three hairs like i look like a cheek.
Like a cat's cheek you know like just.
Whiskers that whiskers coming out that's.
All i got nothing else there mmm.
You know you know it's like a long.
Desert real flat a little bit concave.
Cuz i have no muscles and then like.
Three hot and pine trees sticking out of.
The ground.
What are those pine trees doing there in.
The middle the desert what people tell.
You that no that's me girls what i'm.
Just wondering no i actually had a girl.
Tell me the other day she's like wow you.
Don't have any hair on your.
Back or your chest lucky and i'll just.
Like oh what am i supposed to and then.
She's like well my last boyfriend was.
Russian known to be harry i don't know.
They're a little bit i don't know what.
That mean they're like a human loofah.
But he's russian he's not asian so damn.
Dude are you trying to you know that's.
The one kind of people you don't want to.
Upset dude.
Russians are dope though they're freakin.
Tough there hello let's uh yeah it's a.
Different breed out there dude no but.
Derek i gotta ask you this then if you.
Want to know how to say kiss in russian.
Or no i'm sorry ukrainian you say the.
Song you say what to some just saw is.
That the name of a watch just song is om.
But the one watch i do have is to slant.
It in church.
Anyways i still wanna know saw this so.
That might be french i think there's 20.
Parker's sponsored oh it's light um.
Sorry what were you saying.
Derek what's that i was a girl seeing.
Your shirtless back and chest oh it's.
Just like wrong with that there's.
Nothing wrong i'm getting a massage did.
You have to pay her something about the.
Bass that i have to turn on my.
Headphones it's like it makes me like.
Earwax wiggle something i don't like.
About when you do that i think your.
Voice is so deep it ii dude it's.
Bothering me i think is just the basin.
Might hit my headphones in japan though.
Yeah like people said like i had a.
Really nice low voice you do cuz i would.
Do like out speaking like japanese to.
Them but they'll be like walkley cucuy.
Which means cool yeah voices your voice.
Is naturally very low thank you doesn't.
Mean you need to force it or thank you.
All you talk about the weird things you.
Were gonna do in japan but dude i was in.
Doubt i did chicken out man i was gonna.
Do new do new do massages i was gonna go.
So plan explain is they even illegal.
Like what is that what is that is legal.
You can explain i think it's okay to.
Talk about it cuz you didn't do it yeah.
Essentially it's like it's a massage.
Parlor but.
The oil brothel they all you themselves.
Up i think and then they just rub their.
Bodies on you it's like an erotic.
Massage so they're massaging you with.
Their whole body yeah that sounds like.
Porn that's not really am assault like.
Do they actually massage you i don't.
Know i was hoping for a massage board.
That's my favorite thing that's cool.
Yeah but then there i i didn't do that.
Well yeah yeah why mostly because i was.
Streaming the whole time and you can't.
Like do that kind of stuff that's.
Against tos what's to us terms of.
Service oh yeah you can't do that yeah.
Cuz it's not like family go there though.
No mmm.
To an extent to an egg's what does it.
Mean like they can rub themselves on you.
But as soon as like they touch like.
Genitals and things and you're paying.
Them for that that's like supposed to be.
Not allowed that is silly to me like.
It's you're already rubbing a naked.
Person's body on you and you're naked.
I'm assuming uh i don't i don't know i.
Didn't really do performances that's so.
Interesting.
Yeah how do you guys feel about the.
Legalization of we're not prostitution.
But i guess that is prostitution like.
Sex there's a lot of people recently.
Coming out like i saw in like even like.
Joe rogan's podcast or like this has.
Been around for ages since like early.
Times prostitution yeah paid service.
Yeah and it should be legalized in text.
Mmm guessing the same with like like.
Weed yeah.
But weed is becoming that yeah right and.
Then like it's not even legal here.
Prostitution but people think it is.
Actually in different parts of las vegas.
There are really running brothels yeah i.
Thought that was illegal yeah i've heard.
That before.
Yeah there's certain ones in vegas and.
Really nevada sorry none of that oh yeah.
Yeah hey gaston yeah people think it's.
Are you i think clark county is not.
Legal but there are other counties that.
Are right why i know this it's not.
Because i've been to one it's just doing.
A research oh yeah jokes yeah what was.
It like no i didn't go in i said do mine.
He learned a lot of like sexual related.
Stuff because of paco and he always says.
Research quote-unquote like the how.
About the fact and the weird is almost.
Like hey remember one time oh actually.
Guys the age of consent.
Sixteen and like why do you know like.
Why as a 27 year old or 28 year old man.
Why do you need to know that like it's.
Just like so so for me like i was a.
Virgin until the age of 26 okay yeah.
Just maybe we'll put that out there in.
Your 28 and i'm 28 now that's cool and.
Uh so like a lot of times because people.
Make stupid jokes you know sure but i.
Want and they're like um paco is like.
You know he's so desperate whatever like.
He like probably knows and like they.
Said like he knows that the legal age of.
Consent is 16 in las vegas and i was.
Like what like i thought it was 18 you.
Know throughout the entire country but.
Apparently it isn't like different.
States have different ages consent.
Supposedly like in japan like a.
Prefecture has like the legal age of.
Consent is 13 what yeah.
Damn 13 where i don't know exactly where.
Now this is all word of mouth of course.
I could be wrong so simple google search.
A simple google search good work all.
Right go on um but yeah and then there's.
Like uh like if they're under the legal.
Age of consent but you're within five.
Years of their age in certain states.
Like that's okay you know because if.
You're 18 and your boyfriend or.
Girlfriend is 17 and you guys make love.
Or whatever ah and that person like it.
Would be weird if that person went to.
Jail for that it's 13 in japan 14 in.
China yes the age of consent is 12 in.
The philippines oh my gosh.
Wow that's crazy yeah they i don't think.
They had drinking ages out there any.
They're you could drink it like any age.
Out there i heard something about that.
Though like was it like france or.
Something where they don't have a.
Drinking age or just like really young.
And because that's allowed there there's.
Like significantly like less alcoholism.
And do you i really like alcohol-related.
Incidents i don't know if that's true it.
Was really good they know i did.
Something like maybe i'm a younger age.
Or you just don't crave it or maybe it's.
Just less reported because there's less.
Underage drinking since there's nothing.
Maybe they get.
Their system earlier true so you don't.
Know they don't have to be with it later.
Whereas here in america you know you.
Can't drink 321 so people who want a.
Drink once it hit 21 and they wanted to.
Wise yourself yeah that's that was kind.
Of me i really went crazy 20 even like.
Clubbing and stuff like that although.
I've been to clubs cause of like events.
And stuff but at 21 i had like a six.
Month spree of just like doing little to.
No work and just like going straight.
Clubbing and stuff yes and i've always i.
Learned how much i hated it like that's.
And now and now i got it out of my.
System i don't have any craving ever to.
Go again we should go again okay yeah.
You love going out did you look i like.
My eople i like going out i don't like.
Clubs do your weird bro you'll be at a.
Party just a wallflower.
