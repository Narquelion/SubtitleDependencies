Hey guys so my birthday just passed a.
Couple weeks ago and to me that's.
Usually a sign and a reminder that a.
Bunch of kids just graduated whether.
It's college or high school and it's.
Only a matter of time before we start.
Seeing a bunch of those you know.
Graduation speeches go viral all of like.
Some celebrity or some successful.
Business person seeing something really.
Inspirational to the crowd mate to be.
Able to inspire a bunch of people with.
Just your words especially live in front.
Of thousands of people and then.
Eventually millions within that video.
Goes viral that's that's the dream some.
People just have a natural gift with the.
Words unlike people me i have not much.
Skill and it's not like i haven't been.
Given the opportunity to do it my old.
High school asked me to speak a bunch of.
Times at their graduation or some reason.
Other high schools that i even go to.
Wanted me to speak at there's even some.
Colleges which is pretty ironic.
Considering i'm a college dropout and.
I've turned them all down it's not.
Because i didn't want to do it or.
Because i hate public speaking i can.
Force myself to speak in public i turn.
Them down because i honestly believe.
That if i were to give a speech at a.
Graduation ceremony.
I would probably ruin it or so i've been.
Told by people that i've showed my rough.
Speeches to most of you guys already.
Know but i am pretty realistic and.
Honest and that's not the best qualities.
To sound inspiration like you know those.
Sports movies like read at the end of.
The movie where they have their biggest.
Toughest opponent and then the coach or.
Like a player stands up and gives some.
Inspirational speech to just get.
Everybody pumped up and fired up and.
Just ready to go and beat this team yeah.
I could do that too but at least i'll be.
Honest about it i personally think that.
Being realistic and honest is more.
Inspiring so you're not being lied to.
Look i could tell you guys that we're.
Gonna be the best team stepping on that.
Court tonight i could tell you guys that.
We worked way too hard to be going down.
Like this i could tell you guys that it.
Doesn't matter that they're bigger.
Faster stronger more athletic that even.
Though the entire city the entire state.
Has already counted us out that we don't.
Need to believe it because if we play.
With heart if we play as a team if we.
Play like we want it more than they do.
There is no way we can fail.
You know what it's like to be the ones.
Who are passed on we know what it's like.
To be the ones to start at the bottom of.
The pit and work our asses off to get.
Back to the top no one who's never been.
On the bottom can keep up with people.
Who have and overcame it tell you all.
That cuz we all know it's not accurate.
What i can tell you the truth we will be.
The second best team on that court.
Tonight we will play as a team but so.
Will they and they've been playing.
Together longer than us yes of course we.
Will want it but probably just as much.
As they do because they want to win too.
Right because one thing something does.
Not war getting johnson yes no when you.
Ask that girl to prom that night did you.
Want her to come with you.
Yeah and did she exactly.
Callahan yes coach you're the shortest.
Guy on the team maybe the entire school.
Did you want to be four - mmm and yet.
You still are aren't you mr. ghoulies.
Jolly yes coach when i picked you up.
With a game tonight did you want me to.
Run over you can't wait what i said when.
I picked you up for the game tonight did.
You want me to run over your cat and.
Throw it's half dead body in the bushes.
By your house i do answer the question.
Mr. cooley shall they go of course not.
Exactly see the lesson here is you can.
Want something more than anyone else in.
The world and you still don't get it.
Because the world does not revolve.
Around all of you do you understand me.
What was that yeah so what we gonna do.
Tonight how bad are we.
We went to the state finals that year we.
Didn't play but we cheered really good.
Well but back to the whole graduation.
Speech thing when i would get these.
Graduation speech inquiries i would.
Start writing down a bunch of ideas in.
My phone like how i would plan for a.
Video not planned very well i was just.
Trying to be completely honest and just.
Be me and it turns out that me being me.
Trying to give advice to a bunch of.
Graduates is not only not inspirational.
But borderline inappropriate according.
To some people not that they would know.
Anything they haven't given high school.
Graduation speeches i still think those.
Speeches are decent and not.
Inappropriate at all in fact i still.
Have the drafts on my phone so i can.
Read you guys some of the lines that i.
Had in these speeches that i was told to.
Take out because they're inappropriate.
You guys will see if people are just too.
Sensitive these days i mean like.
Seriously it's a high school graduation.
They're not teenagers and all jokes.
Aside these are actual lines that i.
Wrote for these speeches that i was told.
To take out and i still don't see why.
There you go gotta get into the whole.
Graduation speech voice burning.
Suppression or inspiration robins 20.
Robin antin robin robin burt robin hood.
Batman what am i doing.
Do whatever it is you want to do in life.
If you want to be a drug dealer go be a.
Drug dealer.
People need college as much as they need.
Hair conditioner you can do it you don't.
Need it you already shampoo there are.
Gonna be times that you become so.
Overwhelmed by everything that you might.
Even get to the point where you're.
Thinking about killing yourself nobody.
Likes to study unless you're some kind.
Of freak it doesn't matter if you never.
Reach your goals or accomplish any of.
Your dreams you are going to fail.
Whether it's a test or a job interview.
Or even a relationship you will fail.
Life is like playing a video game.
Life is like a sane and dragonball life.
Is like a box of chocolate some of us.
Have nuts and some of us go yeah i can.
Understand why i was recommended take.
Out some of that stuff not everyone is.
Gonna get the dragon ball or video game.
References let alone the forrest gump.
Thing i don't see what's wrong with the.
Rest of it if i'm hearing it back now i.
Can see how out of context it sounds a.
Little inappropriate but it really isn't.
In reality it's not something that high.
Schoolers haven't already heard they.
Have the internet i just feel like.
People these days are so quick to get.
Upset over every little thing and if.
They were to just take the time to.
Really listen to what's being said they.
Might find that they're getting mad and.
Raising an uproar over pretty much.
Nothing something that is not even being.
Said something that's being created in.
Their own head and for the exact reason.
That's why i would never give a high.
School graduation speech even though.
It's one of my life goals and one of my.
Dream i'm not willing to censor myself.
Some of us have nuts and some don't.
What's wrong with that i mean when i was.
Writing those speeches i was just.
Thinking what i would say to my high.
School self and he he was fine with.
Everything okay he didn't have any.
Problems even though was not the most.
Inspirational he got it he appreciated.
The honesty and honestly he got all the.
References because he is me that's it me.
I need to go to an actual graduation.
Ceremony i need to give some beautifully.
Crafted well-written appropriate speech.
To the class of 2018 i can just give a.
Poorly written not appropriate yet on.
His speech to the class of 2008 mieze i.
Mean not like 2008 different means i.
Meant like me from 2008 so i would be.
Speaking to myself as a high school.
Graduate and you know i'm not gonna.
Waste the time to clone a thousand.
Different means and now please welcome.
Our next speaker mr. ryan higa.
Now before i get started i just wanted.
To say that i'm gonna do my best to keep.
This clean and appropriate for all of.
You while still being honest mmm good.
Evening class of 2000 and actually it's.
Still afternoon there's just really.
Cloudy right now so it looks kind of up.
Sorry let me just good afternoon class.
Of 2008 mieze now i know because i was.
All of you ten years ago that you don't.
Like long speeches because of the whole.
Adhd things so i will keep this short.
And straight to the new iphone yep.
Before not even know you hey come on.
Bunch of freaking idiots or swear oh you.
Really think we're gonna get that fat oh.
Look i'm just gonna get straight to the.
Point and start this off by asking the.
Simplest question you can ask a person.
What is the meaning of life so many.
People young and old have a tough time.
Answering that question but wouldn't you.
Think that should be the first thing.
That we figure out the purpose of our.
Lives the reason why we're doing.
Everything that we're doing there's no.
Right or wrong everyone can have their.
Own answer but to me the meaning of life.
Is happiness i really believe that.
Everything that we do throughout our.
Lives is because we think it will either.
Make us happier or less unhappy than if.
We didn't do it even things that we.
Don't want to do like studying for a.
Test all night you're not gonna gain.
Happiness from studying nobody likes to.
Study unless you're some kind of freak.
You do it because you think it will.
Eventually lead you to happiness just.
Like everything else that we do studying.
Will help you pass a test and you'll be.
A lot happier if you pass a test and if.
You fail passing the test will lead to.
Better grades better grades leads to.
Better colleges better colleges.
Increases your chances of securing a.
Better job and oh sorry my phone locked.
Quick just 6-9 6-9 6-9 better colleges.
Increases your chance at securing a.
Better job that makes more money so you.
Get a nicer car or a nicer house or eat.
It fancier restaurants whatever it is.
You want to do later in life everyone.
Does what they do because they think.
It's gonna make their overall lives.
Better than if they didn't do it and the.
Reason why i bring this up and why i.
Think it's so important to understand.
The meaning of life is because life is.
Gonna become more and more hectic when.
You go off on your own there's gonna be.
So many more things that you have to.
Think about that you never had to think.
About as a kid and there's gonna be.
Times that you get so overwhelmed by.
Everything that you might even get to.
The point where you want to kill.
Yourselves i know i have because life is.
Like a box of chocolates it can be sweet.
It can be.
It can get a little nutty and you no.
Longer have your parents around anymore.
To eat those disgusting raspberry ones.
For you you got to deal with those on.
Your own now when also life is like a.
Box of chocolates because the more you.
Get into it the fatter you get as well.
So these low points in your life are.
Going to happen to you if you want to.
Grow as a person maybe not to the point.
Of considering suicide but just know.
That if it does get to that point that.
It's not happening for no reason and.
There can still be a benefit from it.
Because if you survive and figure your.
Way out of that situation and that.
Mindset you'll have the mental strength.
To be able to deal with anything in the.
Future and you can't acquire that kind.
Of strength without going through.
Extreme adversity it's like a saiyan and.
Dragon ball the more you beat up a sin.
Without killing him stronger he gets.
When he recovers yep i understand that.
Is the first point i understood so far i.
Watched a bunch of those inspirational.
Speeches because i had no idea what.
Possible advice i could have for a bunch.
Of graduates and i want to get an idea.
What those other speakers were talking.
About and a common theme that kept.
Coming up that they were all giving.
Advice on how to strive for greatness or.
How to reach your goals or how to become.
Successful like they are and it's.
Inspiring because they're telling you.
How they were just like you when they.
Were younger and they weren't anybody.
Special and they failed over and over.
And over before they found any success i.
Agree with that message like i mentioned.
Earlier you are gonna have low points.
Failure is a part of life whether it's a.
Job interview or becoming a parent or.
Starting a family whatever it is you're.
Going to fail i completely agree with.
That a lot of these speeches were very.
Inspiring and they are helpful to help.
You reach what our society defines as.
Success but before we figure out how to.
Reach success in life shouldn't we at.
Least try to figure out what success in.
Life is we spend so much time thinking.
About all these goals and dreams that.
We've had since we were little kids and.
How we're gonna reach them that we.
Sometimes get so distracted that we.
Forget why we're trying to strive for.
Them in the first place you can set and.
Go after all the goals you want in life.
But it all leads back to the same thing.
The meaning of life happiness that.
Should be your primary number one going.
Everything else should come after and i.
Know that sounds super obvious and.
Cliche and easier said than done at.
Times but i personally think it's very.
Important to have that in the back of.
Your mind and keep reminding yourself.
That way when you start to stray from it.
You'll recognize it you'd be surprised.
How many people including myself focus.
So much on how to reach our individual.
Goals or what our society defines as.
Success that we don't even realize that.
We're not even happy anymore.
Most of the time that unhappiness is.
Caused by ourselves it's fixable but we.
Don't even recognize it.
So caught up chasing after these goals.
And stress ourselves out so much to the.
Point that we're miserable but yet we.
Just suck it up and we just keep going.
Because we think that once we finally.
Reach these goal is that all this stress.
And unhappiness is gonna go away and.
We're just gonna live a happy jolly gay.
Life well i can tell you from personal.
Experience that's not how it works if.
You're not happy with your life on the.
Journey to your end goal you're most.
Likely not gonna be happy even after you.
Reach it it's like playing a video game.
You don't play a video game that you.
Hate just because you think it's gonna.
Be fun once you finally beat it it's.
Almost the exact opposite of that the.
Best part of the game is a journey the.
Moment you beat it the fun is over but.
It's exactly that it's a moment of.
Happiness and that feeling will fade as.
Soon as the end credits come rolling by.
Then you're bored and it's time for a.
New game my point is don't let society's.
Definition of success dictate your goals.
And dreams and contrary to most.
Inspirational speeches i personally.
Think that it doesn't matter if you.
Never reach any one of your goals or.
Accomplish any one of your dreams if.
You're enjoying the journey don't waste.
Your time playing a game that makes you.
Miserable just because you saw the.
Glorified trailers or because you heard.
All the hype around it we're not having.
Fun playing it it's not gonna get any.
More fun just because you beat it.
There's a lot of other games out there.
And the night is still young you guys.
Have the time find the game that's meant.
For you and have fun playing that's the.
Whole purpose of playing the game that's.
The whole purpose of this journey that's.
The whole purpose of life that being.
Said once again congratulations class of.
2008 mieze i hope you guys have a.
Wonderful journey and a happy afternoon.
Thank you.
Applause.
I just have to say that speech was.
Really long so it's not afternoon now.
It's actually evening you can disrespect.
With peace i hope you never find your.
Game yeah this is also my way of saying.
Stop sending me graduation inquiries.
Because clearly i've already mastered.
That so why would i do it again.
