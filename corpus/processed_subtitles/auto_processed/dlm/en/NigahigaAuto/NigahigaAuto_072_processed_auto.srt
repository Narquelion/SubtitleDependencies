Hey guys so for those of you that don't.
Know i've been making youtube videos for.
About eight years now and a lot has.
Changed since then both good and bad but.
Today i'm gonna be talking about one of.
The bad ones because i'm a pretty.
Pessimistic person i'm pretty negative.
Some people see the glass half full some.
People see the glass half-empty for me.
I'm so negative i don't even see the.
Glass anymore oh no wait it's still have.
Full mmm i just realize what this looks.
Like the letter c anyway i'm gonna be.
Talking about one of the bad changes.
That i've noticed that is definitely on.
The rise on youtube which happens to be.
Yeah you guessed it it's in the title.
Easily but hold people i mean but butter.
Hurt be easily butthurt people in the.
They're hurt what beep-beep-beep-beep.
Ooh but hurt people people who are.
Easily offended and reacted an overly.
Dramatic fashion usually starting with.
The word wow here's some examples of.
Easily butthurt people tune i love nicki.
Minaj she's bom look she's alright you.
Don't think she's bom i mean she's not.
Really my type i kind of more into girls.
That actually wear clothes wow man i.
Can't believe you're just lucky i'm not.
Into slut-shaming she's just not that's.
Not my preference lust shaming is a big.
Problem because it's all over the news.
No i didn't mean that.
You are me made in china hey derrick.
You're chinese right wow.
Oh are you serious what i'm taiwanese.
Man there's a big difference oh i'm.
Sorry man i didn't realize no you didn't.
You're right.
One here funny joke sure alright what do.
You call that asian person i don't know.
What a chunk good okay i don't want fur.
You know alright what do you call a.
School bus full of white people twinkie.
Wow dude what i can't believe you just.
Said that well i thought because you.
Made a racist no my father was killed by.
A tweet you get the point.
Don't get me wrong easily butthurt.
People have always existed they're also.
Known as overly sensitive people i'm.
Sure you know exactly what kind of.
People i'm talking about and maybe it's.
Just me but i feel like over the years.
People have gotten more and more easily.
Butthurt over everything especially on.
Youtube youtube used to be a place where.
You could upload whatever you wanted we.
Uploaded things that we are passionate.
About we could say whatever you wanted.
To say it was like the opposite of.
Television it was freedom but over the.
Years i notice that youtube is becoming.
More and more like television where you.
Have to be really careful with what you.
Say because everything you say is gonna.
Be used against you and it's.
Fend something we can't say or do.
Anything on youtube anymore without a.
Bunch of people being so dramatic thing.
Is i don't even think these people are.
Actually offended half the time i think.
They believe that it's supposed to.
Offend them so they act that way but.
Really doesn't even bother them or maybe.
They just say these things so people.
Agree with them for example i posted a.
Video a couple weeks ago and there's a.
Joke in it that mentions ebola and the.
Thing is if there wasn't so much news.
And articles about ebola right now.
Nobody would have cared about that joke.
At least majority of the people wouldn't.
Have been offended but because it's a.
Turning topic and scary to people it's.
All of a sudden so offensive and for.
Those of you who haven't seen that video.
This is what the joke looked like if a.
Girl that small were to kill me how what.
The hell do there.
Ebola now you really have seven days no.
Why i even told you and from that little.
Mention of ebola i got so many upset.
Comments saying things like that is so.
Offensive people are dying from ebola.
Now it's not a joke yeah making fun of a.
Deadly virus is so funny you're such a.
Bad example for kids see i understand.
When you first see this how you could.
Think it's offensive cuz it's a serious.
Topic in a comedy video think about it.
Does that really offend you or do you.
Just think it should first of all it's.
One joke in a fictional scene on a.
Comedy video on youtube and even if it.
Did does that joke honestly hurt you or.
Offend you in any way because if it does.
I apologize sincerely i did not mean to.
Offend you in any way it wasn't meant to.
Be offensive but if you really do get.
Offended that easily you should probably.
Stay off the internet because you're.
Gonna have a bad time ebola is not.
Something new it's been around for a.
Long time just because something is all.
Of a sudden in the news it doesn't make.
It any less or more deadly than it was.
Before i made that same joke a year ago.
I'm pretty sure nobody would have cared.
Because it wasn't a trending topic there.
Or if i were to switch out the word.
Ebola with something else that's deadly.
Like arsenic people wouldn't have even.
Mentioned it and injecting arsenic is.
Just as deadly if not more deadly you.
Would even have seven days to live you.
Died that day and last if mentioning.
Ebola in a youtube video is a bad.
Example for kids just because it's a.
Deadly virus and what about children.
Shows like tom and jerry that entire.
Children's show is about a cat trying to.
Murder a mouse but i guess attempted.
Murder is not that bad right because.
It's not in the news but it is or what.
About pokemon that's a bunch of people.
Who are capturing wild animals and.
Keeping them captive in a little ball.
Raising them until they're strong enough.
To fight other animal sounds like animal.
Cruelty to me or even spongebob there's.
Not much violence in that one but it's.
Very sexually inappropriate for kids.
Come on they live in bikini bottom and.
There's somebody named sandy cheeks in.
Bikini bottom and also there's a mr.
Krabs in bikini bottom don't even get me.
Started on squidward's nose.
Childhood ruined and like i said these.
Are all children's shows burt.
And me because i watch them occasionally.
Sometimes okay i watch them all the time.
So well you easily butthurt people out.
There the next time you feel like.
Something is offensive to you asked.
Yourself this does this really bother.
You does it actually offend you or are.
You just thinking that because you feel.
Like you should be offended even though.
You're really not and also because you.
Want to make a point to the rest of your.
Butthurt friends can thumbs up your.
Comment because if that's the case.
You're one of the main reasons why.
Youtube is becoming a butthurt place and.
It's a real pain in the ass pun not.
Intended but intended seriously let me.
Just go back to the fun youtube.
Community that it once was i know that.
Was a long time ago about eight years i.
Was like 15 or 16 i'm getting old now.
I'm 24 i'm about to die wow that is.
Really offensive what you just said.
You're 24 and you're about to die that's.
Really offensive to everyone older than.
It was a joke that is not something you.
Should joke about you should never never.
Joke about that.
Never say never.
Oh so now you're supporting guns and old.
Outdated justin beiber references that's.
Even more offensive than before you.

Africa because you're all in the first.
Rogue country where you even have to.
Care about what everything what's up i.
Didn't even shoot you that time but i.
Did let me guess i said something.
Offensive to you now what no those guys.

Getting butthurt over every little thing.
Thank you that is what i've been trying.
To save this whole time thank god.
Someone is finally wise okay you know.

The moment you bring religion into this.
That's the moment you know what i give.
