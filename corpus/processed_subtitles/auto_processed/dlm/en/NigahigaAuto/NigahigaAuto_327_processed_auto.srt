Here you are.
Oh thank you oh oh my god that's not.
Here let me mug you instead don't even.
Worry about it.
Well man with a knife.
You think pretty genius huh.
Well maybe not ingenious but definitely.
Ingenious do you see how irritating that.
Is this video is actually nothing like.
What the title says well i mean.
Technically it was about a woman trying.
To mug a man who happens to have a knife.
And what he did next was kinda genius.
But definitely more gina sh do look this.
Video is about something that i've been.
Irritated with for a very long time now.
And even more so because i feel like.
It's happening more and more these days.
As you can probably already tell i'm.
Talking about misleading titles i don't.
Know about you guys i get really upset.
When there's articles that have really.
Intriguing and interesting titles but.
Then when you click on them the story or.
Video or whatever it's supposed to be is.
Nothing like the title basically these.
Websites and post these articles and.
Videos try and come up with any single.
Title that will get you to click on them.
Even if the article or video is barely.
Related they'll still try and exaggerate.
The title just so you click on i mean i.
Guess it's kinda exactly what i did in.
This video the sad part is this video is.
Actually more relevant to the title than.
Most articles these days you know which.
Ones i'm talking about.
You'll be on facebook scrolling through.
Your newsfeed and all of a sudden you.
See an article is saying something like.
This man boom the secret to a living.
Forever exclamation point exclamation.
Point exclamation point but really it's.
Just about a 95 year old man who can.
Still run a mile or something or maybe.
You're on twitter and you see a tweet.
That says something like click on this.
Link to see the most amazing 5 year old.
Kid that ever lived and then it's just.
Like a video of a little boy on x-factor.
Who can sing amazingly well for his age.
But it's still like pretty average in.
Comparison to most singers maybe you're.
Even on youtube and you see a video.
Called woman tries to mug man with a.
Knife but what he did next was genius.
But really it's just a video about a.
Stupid asian kid sitting in a chair in.
Front of a camera with no pants on but.
It's not like you can see his bottom.
Half in the frame anyway what anyway.
I've been tricked so many times into.
Clicking links that i'm almost at the.
Point where i just don't click them.
Anymore which actually sucks because.
Sometimes there are really good articles.
And videos that actually do live up to.
Their title so again i'm sorry for.
Anyone who actually got tricked by the.
Title of this video i'm just trying to.
Make a point and spread this message so.
That people stop using misleading titles.
Or if they do people at least call them.
Out for if you're like me and you're.
Consistent victim to these misleading.
Titles then help me spread this message.
Please i know for those of you who've.
Been watching for a while you already.
Knew this video was gonna be nothing.
A woman bugging a man with a knife and.
It definitely wasn't gonna be genius at.
All or dot dot dot is it you think.
Pretty genius huh.
Well maybe not ingenious but definitely.
Ingenious yeah dumb pun.
Empty your pockets give me everything.
