Hey guys so i like to think of myself as.
A pretty positive thinker but at the.
Same time a lot of the closest people.
Around me seem to think the opposite i.
Always have to hear things like why are.
You so pessimistic don't be so negative.
All the time why can't you see the glass.
Half full instead of half empty for once.
By the way that saying is not always.
True because it depends on what the.
Glass is filled with if the glass is.
Half full with spoiled milk it's.
Probably more positive to see it half.
Empty just saying but moving on i'm not.
Gonna live in times the things i say can.
Be a little negative for example.
Whenever i took final exams in high.
School i would always assume that i got.
The lowest grade possible just so i.
Could mentally prepare myself in case i.
Fail or when i was wrestling for a state.
Championship i told myself before the.
Match means second place is still good.
Or especially when it came to girls.
Whenever i will try to prepare myself to.
Ask what a girl i would think of every.
Single way that i would be rejected so i.
Would know how to react in that scenario.
Which consequently made me not know what.
To do when they said yes and that made.
It super awkward but anyway whenever i.
Voiced these opinions to my friends or.
Family they would always criticize me.
For being negative and i'm sure you guys.
Can relate to this we all know that one.
Friend or a family member that's mr. and.
Mrs. positive and gets on everybody's.
Case whenever you say the slightest bit.
Thing that's a little bit negative but.
What people don't know about me even my.
Closest friends and family is that i'm.
Actually a really really positive.
Thinker like all really positive just in.
My own head in my head i see the glass.
Half-full even when it's empty i pretty.
Much taught myself how to see the good.
In every scenario no matter how bad it.
Might look i just don't say these things.
Out loud because when bad things happen.
To people and you're overly positive a.
Lot of times it comes off as insensitive.
Or rude thinking like this actually.
Helped me through a lot of tough times.
And rough situation but again i'm just.
Giving you guys these examples so that.
You can see how i try to stay positive.
In my own head i would never say these.
Things out loud and you shouldn't either.
Trust me you do not want to say these.
Things out loud my thought process is.
That no matter how bad things get even.
In the worst case scenario wherever.
There's a negative there has to be a.
Positive you just have to find it.
Hey what's wrong man i just found out my.
Girlfriend's been cheating on me what.
I'm so sorry that's terrible and that's.
Probably what i would say in that.
Scenario but that's not quite what i.
Would be thinking like i said i'm an.
Overly positive person in my head and.
This is what it would look like if i.
Said what i was really thinking hey.
What's wrong man.
I just found out my girlfriend's been.
Cheating on me that's a wonderful bro.
You don't have to waste any more time.
Wondering if she's the one hey what's up.
Man my grandfather just passed away such.
A great guy so unfair.
So sorry bro that's so sad again that.
Something i would say but my mind is.
Messed up and i would search for the.
Positive even in that it would something.
My grandfather just passed away such a.
Great guy so fair sorry to hear that man.
But i guess everyone has to die sometime.
Right i mean if everyone lived forever.
We'd all be dead due to the exponential.
Growth of the human population we.
Wouldn't have enough resources so in a.
Way it's not the worst thing in the.
World what happen somebody stole all her.
Clothes from the laundromat like.
Literally a hundred dollars worth that.
Sucks i mean like who would even do that.
You know the drill what happened.
Somebody stole all her clothes from the.
Laundry.
Like literally a hundred dollars worth.
Hey good for you that's a compliment.
That means you have really good taste in.
Fashion see technically these are all.
Positive things but now you probably.
Know why i'm telling you to keep this in.
Your own head having these overly.
Positive thoughts didn't necessarily fix.
Any of the scenarios but they definitely.
Helped you to get through them and i.
Know sometimes it's hard to think.
Positive when you're sad or upset but.
When you do have those moments you tend.
That i'm they're giving you positive.
Thoughts oh my god.
I'm only 16 what are they gonna do now.
You don't have to worry about getting.
Pregnant for another nine months i could.
Never fall asleep i hate having insomnia.
It's better than not being able to wake.
Up and being in a coma damn it they.
Forget my chalupas every single time wow.
That is really courteous of them to be.
Helping you with your diet like that oh.
There's a dog poop all the places i.
Could have stepped hey man it could have.
Been worse at least i was in human poop.
Or like the dog itself or like hiv.
Contaminating or lego damn my stomach.
Hurts so bad.
Maybe if i fart just a little bit you.
Won't smell it and i'll feel better oh.
Music.
God.
At least you didn't wear your white.
Undies today undies today undies today.
Undies today you can't believe my cat is.
Gone forever at least it wasn't your dog.
You can't believe my dog is gone forever.
At least it wasn't your cat you can't.
Believe i lost my cat and dog on the.
Same day well at least you can still.
Watch cat dog online to make yourself.
Feel better.
What's cat dog you don't know what cat.
Dog is and i feel so old now if yours.
I'm gonna get that reference or you.
Could just get rid of this scene and not.
Put it in the video ah but i can't take.
The scene out now the video is already.
Online so you can take it out we're.
Still filming it and it's not even.
Edited yet man the scene is so confusing.
I should just take it out or maybe some.
People will get it my cat and dog were.
Still gone well at least this scene made.
The video don't ask i don't even know.
Anyway you see no matter how bad things.
Get or how bad things may seem there's.
Always a positive in everything because.
Our world runs on balance and there.
Can't be a negative without a positive.
Life may give you a glass that looks.
Half empty at times but it's you and.
Only you that has the power of choice to.
Make that glass half full and if you can.
Do that there's nothing in this universe.
That can ever bring you down again.
Cheers oh yep that's definitely spoiled.
I should probably go to the bathroom.
Before i oh god well at least i'm not.
Wearing my white undies today.
Applause.
