I am not infocus sorry guys i'm sick i.
Have to deal with the nays on these.
Nasal ness nasal enos hey guys so today.
I'm gonna be talking about one of my.
Biggest pet peeves and that pet peeve.
Just so happens to be you know when.
People text message you one word at a.
Time rather than putting all the texts.
Into one text message so now you have.
Like 20 notifications yeah i hate that.
Oh and also overdramatic oh come on.
You gotta be kidding i'm not even gonna.
Redo this i'm just gonna let it go oh.
Drama dick um so as i was mentioning.
Earlier we probably all know at least.
One overdramatic person and if you don't.
Have anyone like this in your life it's.
Probably because it's you and you don't.
Think that you're being overdramatic.
Because more dramatic situations are.
Like normal situations too overdramatic.
People and it's not necessarily a bad.
Thing it's just people like myself.
Warned vonda's drama get a little.
Annoyed sometimes when you guys know.
What kind of people i'm talking about.
Right these are the people that can.
Literally make a big deal out of.
Anything no matter how small it is oh my.
God what dana posted a picture on.
Instagram 20 minutes ago so so that.
Means she's on instagram and that's bad.
Yeah she didn't like my post no tiger.
Not like 3 hours ago yeah that's awful.
And by making this a bigger deal these.
People actually create drama that was.
Never there who's something you're not.
Actually nicole over there i have to.
Confront her she's my best friend what.
If she just didn't see it okay i tagged.
Her and i know she keeps her.
Notifications on so she definitely saw.
Him chose not to like it so there's.
Something a hundred thousand percent.
Wrong i have talked to rich and even.
When they come to realize that there was.
No drama in the first place hey where's.
Your problem with me huh oh yeah i know.
So why don't you like it i think i know.
You posted yeah right i tagged you in at.
Like three hours ago.
See i mean come on we always like each.
Other's photos and like i don't even.
Know what why you you tagged the wrong.
Account me why yeah yeah mine is i'm.
Over the underscore but being the.
Overdramatic person that they are they.
Somehow find a way to create even more.
Drama out of that because what's life.
Without drama.
I'm so sorry no no don't even worry.
About it i would do the same girl i know.
Like totally overreacted so crazy.
Oh look ryan even warned me that you're.
On your way oh right that's so funny oh.
My god it's so funny you know when.
People text messaged you one word at a.
Time rather than putting all the texts.
Into one text message so now you have.
Like 20 notifications yeah as you can.
Probably see overdramatic people or some.
Of the most annoying people in the world.
But if you want look on the bright side.
While being annoying they're actually.
Some of the most interesting and.
Entertaining people to be around because.
They're never bored bored is an emotion.
That overdramatic people will hardly.
Ever feel because their mind can make.
Anything and everything seem important.
And interesting they have the power to.
Basically take nothing and turn it into.
An incredibly important big deal it's.
Basically like clickbait she has a.
Pretty good sing overdramatic people are.
Basically like limbing click babies come.
Here rocket come here come here what's.
Wrong nothing just on my period come on.
Aren't you being a little overdramatic.
Excuse me how would you know what do i.
Feel like if you never had one before.
Wait a second wait no you're right i've.
Never had a period before okay obviously.
I exaggerated but that's kind of the.
Whole point that's a textbook example of.
An overdramatic person taking a.
Situation that barely happened and then.
Making into something that you would see.
In a youtube thumbnail it actually got.
Me kind of interested in got me thinking.
Like what makes over demand people want.
To do this is it because they love drama.
Or maybe they just want more attention i.
Just couldn't figure it out then i.
Thought maybe i'm wrong you know maybe.
It's not for attention or because they.
Love drama some people are just.
Different i mean there's two ends of the.
Spectrum there just like emotional.
Thinkers and logical thinkers and i.
Think if you're on the emotional side.
That's like the overdramatic people.
People like myself are more on the.
Logical side and just to be clear i'm.
Not saying either side is wrong we're.
Just different people emotional people.
May see things completely different from.
A logical person and it's because they.
Literally see life in a different way i.
Mean if that's the case it's actually.
Pretty amazing because like for over.
Today people are always exciting their.
Life is like a movie it's a drama.
You see i presented all those skits.
Earlier from my perspective the you know.
The boring perspective the logical one.
But imagine what those little situations.
Would look like from the point of view.
Of a overdramatic person take a look.
I don't know how to tell you this i.
Don't even know how it happened i'm.
Pregnant.
There's no legality.
Go.
Pregnant i have a baby inside how is.
That even possible.
You know what build what are you talking.
About.
Button nipples rjp who don't even have.
Don't you ever talk my nipples a kid.
Anyway the moral of the story here is.
That there are just different types of.
People in this world yes those overly.
Emotional overly dramatic people who.
Might seem incredibly annoying to.
Someone like me and i'm sure a bunch of.
You as well i mean it's not their fault.
That's just how they think that's just.
How they see life so if you ever get.
Annoyed or you have to deal with an.
Overdramatic person in your life don't.
Even bother trying to be reason that.
You're never gonna win in trying to.
Convince a overdramatic over emotional.
Thinker to think logically because.
That's just not who they are my advice.
To you and the only thing that you can.
Do is to just accept them for who they.
Are admit defeat let them be there or.
There's also one last trick you could.
Also speak their language be even more.
Overdramatic than they are so how long.
Have you guys been sleeping together.
What don't you lie to me i was texting.
You the whole time on the way back from.
Our house i know you know what i'm.
Talking equate a second you were texting.
The whole time yeah and you weren't.
Responding so i know you were talking to.
Her you were texting and driving yeah my.
Sister died from a man who was texting.
And driving you don't even have a sister.
You're gonna bring that up didn't know.
You wanted a sister i had no idea i did.
And now you know.
Music.
