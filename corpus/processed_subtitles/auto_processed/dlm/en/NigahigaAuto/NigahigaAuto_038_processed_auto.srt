Dear ryan what came first the chicken or.
The egg hey guys so i don't know why.
This has always been such a popular dear.
Ryan i mean it always has been i get.
This one all the time i mean look how.
Many likes this one comment has i'm.
Finally just gonna put this ridiculous.
Question to an end once and for all i'm.
Gonna scientifically prove what came.
First the chicken or the egg using the.
Power of math i'm not gonna lie you're.
Probably gonna need to know at least.
Basic algebra to follow along it's not.
Algebra it's like my version of ryan's.
Algebra algebra you have to learn how to.
Brian to understand this so in order to.
Answer the most famous question of all.
Time what came first the chicken or the.
Egg we're gonna need to start with the.
Most famous equation of all time e.
Equals mc-squared.
In school they teach you that einstein.
Meant that e equals mc-squared is energy.
Equals mass times the speed of light.
Square that's completely wrong in.
Algebra what it really means is egg.
Equals matter times chicken little.
Floating number two and in order to find.
Out what came first we have to figure.
Out the matter at hand which is m we.
Have to figure out what m equals.
Basically we have to find out what m.
Equals by getting m by itself this is.
Where basic algebra comes if you take.
The square root of both sides of the.
Equation the square root gets rid of the.
Little phone number two leaving you with.
The square root of e equals m times c.
And now to get rid of c you divide the.
Chicken on both sides leaving you with.
Square root of b over c equals m now.
This may look even more confusing but.
Bear with me a little floating number.
Two and the c that we got rid of earlier.
Will help you to understand c if we were.
To write this out we're left with.
Chicken little floating number two.
Notice anything familiar exactly chicken.
Little and the nursery rhyme nursery.
Rhymes were trying to tell us the whole.
Time chicken little as the one who said.
The sky is falling and falling is the.
Opposite of floating so if we take the.
Opposite of chicken little floating we.
Get egg big falling big egg falling what.
Big egg is most famous for falling yet.
Another nursery rhyme humpty dumpty the.
Same one dee dummy that was on a wall.
And had a great fall get it on a wall.
Great fall he was on the great war the.
Great wall of china which means humpty.
Dumpty was tiny in fact his name wasn't.
Even humpty dumpty it was just who but.
They added the humpty dumpty to make it.
More pleasant for kids i guess but who.
Was indeed a chinese egg which means he.
Came from a chinese chicken explains why.
Chickens go bock bock bock.
They're trying to say bock is in bok.
Choy like a chinese cabbage and since.
Eggs are the opposite of a chicken in.
This equation if the eggs name was who.
The opposite of that is on that was the.
Name of the chinese chicken ah ah the.
Chinese chicken gave us who the chinese.
Egg but as you know as much as chickens.
Do lay eggs.
Do hats chicken so uh doesn't just give.
Us who who gives up because chickens and.
Eggs are one but don't forget we still.
Have the number two one to twelve.
You see if we go back to our original.
Equation square root of e over c is just.
Twelve because the square root of an egg.
Where eggs come from is a chicken and if.
You're left with the chicken over a.
Chicken that's two chickens that become.
One one to twelve.
We all know that in egg terms that.
Twelve eggs is it does a dozen equals.
Matter so if you really want to know the.
Truth and put an end to the most famous.
Question of all time.
All you need is basic algebra and the.
Answer is simple it doesn't matter who.
Gives us so thank you guys so much for.
