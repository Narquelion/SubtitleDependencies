For 40 minutes crying like a baby.
Bikers joggers tourists runners they.
Went by me police officers searching for.
Suicidal people want bobby twice i'm.
Standing at the ledge leaning over the.
Rail with tears flowing down to the.
Waters and i thought to myself.
Absolutely nobody cares and then the.
Voice in my head said jump now and i did.
And the millisecond that my hands.
Cleared the rail my legs flew over it.
Was an instant regret the depression was.
Wiped from my mind and all i wanted to.
Do was live and i thought it's too late.
Kevin hines was 19 when he jumped off.
The golden gate bridge he is one of the.
Many incredible people that i've been.
Grateful to meet over the past three.
Weeks as i aim to further understand the.
Complexities surrounding suicide i know.
I've made mistakes i know i've let.
People down but what happens when you're.
Given an opportunity to help make a.
Difference in the world the backlash.
Against the social media star very.
Popular guy called logan paul is in some.
Honkies are complete and utter.
Insensitive idiot i'm gonna break from.
Daily vlogging he says his latest.
Content was his biggest mistake.
Apologize to the victim and his family.
It's time to learn from the past as they.
Get better and grow as a human being i'm.
Here to have a hard conversation so that.
Those who are suffering can have easier.
Ones so i've never been so humbled in my.
Life by a single event were you kind of.
Shocked but i was shocked to discover.
Just how big this is you've never known.
Anybody that killed themselves no one no.
One that was know as that was part of.
The problems just my ignorance on the.
Subject i didn't ohio where you come.
From it's the second leading cause of.
Death.
And i know while i'm not able to solve.
The problem by myself i want to be a.
Part of the solution and that solution.
Began across the country in new york.
City.
We sat down with dr. chandra the.
Director of the national suicide.
Prevention lifeline we have to change.
The conversation publicly from just.
Focusing on suicide and how something.
Bad is happening and say well what do we.
Do about help people understand that the.
First thing they need to do is reach out.
And talk to somebody when they're.
Feeling in despair because you're not.
Alone with anymore they've done studies.
With people who are who are experiencing.
Any kind of pain including hanging off a.
Cliff you can hold on a lot longer if.
Somebody is right there with you i think.
As a society as human beings we just.
Have to be more compassionate and that.
Includes me too that's something i'm.
Learning along this journey and.
Something else that dr. draper told me.
Where the five steps that anyone can.
Take to help prevent suicide.
Step one is simply just ask and ask.
Yourself ask others are you thinking.
About suicide and i know that sounds.
Like a daunting question but literally.
That question can save lives.
Step two accordingly would be to listen.
Be present don't make any judgments and.
Then step three would be be there for.
Them even after you've already asked.
Because dependability is key step four.
Is then help them connect whether it's.
With a friend a family member or local.
Suicide hotline therapist but help them.
Reach out to someone so they don't have.
To deal with this alone lastly step five.
Is just checking on them show them that.
You care call them up say hey i want to.
Make sure you're okay can i check in.
With you over the next few days so one.
Of the things that is so important about.
Reducing stigma is getting stories out.
There about people positively coping.
With suicide do you guys know anyone i.
Could talk to.
With the lived experiences absolutely we.
Have quite a number of people that we.
Could deliver over to you yeah.
That'd be great yeah and that's how we.
Got introduced to kevin hines seventeen.
Years ago kevin jumped off of the golden.
Gate bridge and survived.
These are individuals whose stories when.
People hear them they say you know maybe.
I can get through as opposed to hearing.
The stories when people happen and those.
Unfortunately those are stories that.
We've heard before now we're hearing.
More and more stories of people being.
More open about it as i was saying.
Before logan for every one person that.
Dies by suicide there's 287 other people.
That think seriously about it but don't.
Those are stories again that have not.
Been told if we told those stories of.
People who got through it as opposed to.
One who didn't imagine what kind of.
Influence that would have on people's.
Behavior when i found out that one in.
Six high school kids seriously think.
About suicide that's that's stunning.
Yeah this is such a common problem logan.
All i wanted was for one person to look.
Me in my eyes say hey kid are you okay i.
Am so grateful to be alive and i'm.
Grateful today for every millisecond i.
Get to breathe cuz it was almost all.
Ripped from me by me what's one thing.
You would have said to your younger self.
To the kevin who was 19 sitting on the.
Bus if you were next to you and instead.
Of the guy who pointed and laughed what.
Would you say i would just put my hand.
On this.
I'll just put my hand on my shoulder and.
I would just say i'm here for you.
I got you we need to be a society that.
Comes together for every person in the.
Community that's going to hell and in.
Order to do that every person that's.
Going through hell whatever hell has to.
Be honest about their pain and if.
They're gonna be honest about their pain.
We are going to collectively answer the.
Call and be there for that individual.
Because if you don't see beauty and the.
Next person you meet you're not looking.
Hard enough you're incredible dude this.
Is not it's an honor for me to brother.
Music.
From this point on i want to make an.
Effort to contribute and immerse myself.
In the conversation so i'm pledging to.
Donate 1 million dollars to various.
Suicide prevention organizations with.
The first $250,000 going immediately to.
The national suicide prevention lifeline.
So they can increase their capacity to.
Help those in need for anyone watching i.
Want you to know you are not alone and.
Most of the time crisis passes so if you.
Or anyone you know feels alone we're.
Trapped i encourage anyone to call or.
Even text a suicide or crisis hotline.
Both of those numbers over lo and.
Although this is a tough conversation.
It's important because things can and.
Will get better it's time to start a new.
Chapter in my life as i continue to.
Educate both myself and others on.
Suicide i'm humbled and thankful to say.
This is just the beginning.
Music.
