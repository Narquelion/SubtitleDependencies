Scientists can't explain it right the.
Moon emits its own light i guess casey's.
Really rubbing off on me.
What could possibly be happening in that.
Area pam is there anything else we could.
Do at this point besides go to the same.
Parking lot we've been to a million.
Times i'm sick of this    pam i'm.
Literally with you pam it's greenbox.
Storage and chicken focaccia.
Every friday like let's do something.
Different we gotta switch things up but.
We're getting a divorce i hate you.
You pam you stupid    i wanna go.
Back to that    parking lot again.
Yeah man that    was crazy okay the.
Tell-all how do we do this how do we.
Trick the entire internet and the flat.
Earthers and what was the process behind.
It where do we even start.
I would definitely say that logan paul.
Movie and that's another thing that he.
Outright lied about was the fact that he.
Was going to be doing a documentary that.
Was a movie with acting.
Full-on acting the entire thing was.
Scripted he's right it was scripted.
Five pages actually page one page two.
Page three page four page five there was.
A lot of thought that went into this and.
When you guys asked this question.
Muhammad said how did you get the idea.
To make this masterpiece one day i was.
Watching i got sucked into like the.
Youtube like conspiracy rabbit hole as.
Like we all do.
And i was fascinated this group of.
People called the flat earthers that.
Actually think the earth is flat and i.
And i heard about this a while ago and i.
Actually like referenced it in one of my.
Vlogs yo if you think the earth is flat.
You seriously do you think the.
Earth is flat yo let me give you a.
Little science lesson spencer all right.
The earth is round and then i heard.
About this uh flat earth international.
Conference where like all these people.
These crazy people gather in one spot.
And i knew.
It was an opportunity for golden content.
So the first thing i did.
Was buy tickets and it sent mike an.
Email i was just about to move here i.
Got an email that said congratulations.
You're going to the flat earth.
International conference oh i didn't.
Even tell you i had no idea and then you.
Called me and you're like hey you ready.
For your first acting gig guy.
And i had no idea what was going on and.
It was literally like the first project.
That we worked on.
A lot of people wanted to know how like.
You were good bro for your first acting.
Gig ever where does that come from i.
Don't even know dude i think right after.
We talked i started working on that.
Story.
Oh my god that's right came up with the.
The story about his dad being a.
Contractor.
For antarctica i think that was your.
Idea yeah and then you would sit like.
People would come over and you would.
Tell them about your track your dad.
And pete rest in peace i really truly.
Believed.
Uh what the storyline was and i think.
Mike his best friend really helped play.
It along.
That's because mike lost a a friend.
All right pete didn't die pete doesn't.
He's not even a real person.
He never existed i don't even know where.
Like the the like inspiration came for.
Him the flashy.
You you that was on the spot yeah.
Because like i was trying to think of.
Like how someone could fall over the.
Side because by the way i have really.
Flat feet yeah they're like big paddles.
With bunions and there's flats that.
Scene was so hard to film.
I mean they saw it in the bloopers that.
Was broke a thousand times.
And i practiced it so many times in.
Front of so many people and then once we.
All sat in here like we are right now is.
In this exact room yeah guy just.
Couldn't.
Hold it together i was worried that at.
The end of the dock.
When mike flipped and said he was.
Spoiler alert that he was not a flat.
Earther that people wouldn't believe.
That that people would think that was.
The joke so we overacted it.
With the little underlying hint that.
Like.
You're    around with everyone i.
Think well i think once people heard.
Pete go over the side.
That they like the majority of people.
Right there were like yo there's no.
There's.
Absolutely no    way this is true.
Logan paul was.
Punking everyone at flat earthers.
Expense this was a great big punk on the.
Entire internet.
Because everyone was falling for this.
That oh my goodness he's he's becoming a.
Flat earther.
This is my favorite part about this.
Documentary like.
Part of the reason i made it it sounds.
Bad it was kind of like a.
Like a    you in a way everyone in.
Today's society is so quick to hop on.
The train whichever way it's going.
Especially if the terrain involves.
Hating logan paul that's like a.
Fun thing to do nowadays so this was my.
Way of tricking.
Every single person who wanted to hate.
Me we did dupe the internet i got duped.
Too.
Seriously i did by the real logan paul.
He's over there.
Gotcha dumbass i even got comments a lot.
Of these actually i feel like you.
Finessed youtube and i have.
Much more respect for you now like you.
Guys saw at the end of the dock so many.
People logan paul's an idiot he's a flat.
Earther.
Actually even like it was so hard to.
Stay in.
Flat earth character for so long like i.
Was just getting railed by everyone.
For being a flat earther this part's.
Interesting the flat earth society.
Tweeted at me this went like viral on.
Reddit disdained me.
And refused to acknowledge me as part of.
The.
Society but the flat earth society what.
The real flat earth is called we found.
This out.
Controlled opposition the flatter.
Society aren't even the real flat.
Earthers but now i'm sucked into this.
Like weird spot where do i try to.
Explain to like the real world.
That the flatter society is separate.
From the real flat earthers and.
Even be involved with these people.
Anymore like i don't know it was just it.
Was so confusing it was like you got.
Uninvited to a party that you didn't.
Want to be at yes exactly.
Yeah they were just like yes i don't.
Want to be part of the    group i.
Want to talk about.
The backlash we're getting it's minor.
The backlash i thought i was going to.
Get.
Was the media coming out and saying.
Logan paul is perpetuating.
Ignorance by even spreading this fable.
That the earth is indeed shaped like a.
Pancake floating through space.
Thank god that did not happen the.
Backlash that we are getting you tricked.
The flat earthers you know you lied to.
Their face.
Why did you do that how do you feel.
About that like the doc was awesome but.
You haiky lied used and took advantage.
Of those people and they genuinely.
Trusted you love the doc though.
Thanks dude my logic was this if they.
Were if they're willing to lie to.
Themselves.
And lie to the world try and perpetuate.
This movement of idiocracy.
I was willing to lie to them about.
Something that i really.
Really don't believe in like here here's.
Me coming clean i.
Really really dislike this movement not.
The two my own horn.
You guys may know i got a full academic.
Ride to college for engineering i got a.
Five on my ap physics test science.
Biology.
Facts i guess you could say is kind of.
My thing in math too like i was a.
I was a geek in high school but i.
Promised myself that i was going to go.
To the conference with an open mind as.
Much as.
And you two remember when i told you.
That you were going to become a flat.
Earther.
You were like no i was worried none of.
These people were.
Like mean in any way like they never at.
Any point were like rude tossed they.
Were all really nice people and to be.
Honest with you like coming out of it.
I've made a couple of comments to you.
That like i actually did there were.
Times where i actually started to feel.
Kind of bad about the situation there's.
Just like a part of me that like just.
Didn't feel.
Great about it but at the same time like.
They are like perpetuating a lie.
To like not only other people but also.
Like kids.
I i can't i can't fully wrap my head.
Around it and i was willing.
To stand behind my actions for the.
Satire that we created.
To hopefully spread the truth about how.
Like honestly really    stupid this.
Movement is and to be honest i don't.
Even want to call it a movement.
I don't think it's a movement i think.
It's a group of like-minded people who.
Simply refuse education and refuse to.
Believe.
The truth the flat earth gathering is a.
Thing.
Because a lot of the stuff they say like.
Does make sense.
Because what they do is they cherry pick.
They work backwards not.
Trying to prove that the earth is flat.
Instead trying to disprove that the.
Earth is round.
And they cherry pick the facts that they.
Want you to see.
To get to point b while skipping point a.
They are so tied into this belief.
That the earth is flat no one in this.
Massive group is willing to actually.
Go prove it right like they're like oh.
We can't go to antarctica because.
There's this rogue.
Nasa force that will stop us at the.
Border so we can't go there to.
Prove that there's this ice shell but if.
You've devoted your like this robbie.
Davidson has devoted his entire life to.
It.
Like go like go there someone do.
Something someone with a camera.
Be the patriot with a with a hidden.
Camera and and show us that you've been.
Stopped by this rogue.
Force of of government you know that.
That won't let you pass.
Here's why it gets tricky like these.
Flat earth believers.
It's bigger than just them believing in.
The flat earth they don't believe in.
Anything they.
They question everything but this is the.
First movie all scripted.
All acted from start to finish the.
Entire thing was a comedy that's what.
I'm saying.
That's proof robbie was we wrote him in.
He's our protagonist.
The way it works is there's a few of.
Them can speak well.
And articulate and do have like a really.
High.
Functioning level of intelligence and.
They're the ones that are the speakers.
For example this guy rick hummer he was.
The master of.
Ceremonies he introduced all the guests.
And sort of ran the show the dude like.
Many of the flat earthers is just out of.
Touch we were um.
In the parking lot talking with uh.
Robbie and rick and the dude.
Throws out yeah and he's such a such a.
Bag because yeah he went from the cubs.
To the reds like that.
So i'm gonna reiterate the dude said a.
No-no.
When i heard it i was like oh.
And i'm like you don't see the cameras.
In your face you can't really the dude's.
Not gonna get canceled the flat earthers.
Don't care they're not they're i don't.
Know what i'm saying.
Percentage this wasn't like a a.
Hit piece per se i just wanted to show.
How ridiculous.
All of this was quite honestly just.
Crafting a story around them they did.
The work for us.
And that's why it worked so well why do.
You think flat earthers.
Are flat earthers and is there going.
Back say they changed their mind from a.
Flat earther back to around earth.
I'm sure like they're just like a.
Movement of people that.
Do what they do to kind of like feel.
Like they belong to something like a.
Club.
That was that was the conclusion i.
Reached yeah like just like anything.
Like that.
Anti-vaxxers like there's just a whole.
Different a whole bunch of different.
Movements of people that i feel like.
They.
Are able to like come together it's.
Almost like not in the same you know.
Vein obviously but like a comic book.
Club.
Dungeons and dragons like people coming.
Together obviously this is much.
Different than those but for some.
Common purpose and like they've been.
Probably cast out by.
By reality social anxieties they have.
Or like social like the ineptness they.
Have and they come together and they.
Feel like they belong to something.
Together.
More so if they were to leave.
Like if robbie davidson all of a sudden.
If the earth was.
Proven for the millionth time tomorrow.
To like.
Be round robbie davidson is no longer.
The ceo of this non-existent movement.
Like what does he do what do all the.
Speakers do what do they all do.
At this point they're locked in like.
Sure stick with your guns roll with it.
You're making money selling.
200 tickets by the way to a flat earth.
Conference like go for it i read this.
Quote today actually i have this book.
Upstairs i'm reading this book it's.
Called how to win friends and.
Influence people this was crazy i came.
Across this today on the plane some.
Authorities.
Declare that people may actually go.
Insane in order to find.
In the dreamland of insanity the feeling.
Of importance that has been denied them.
In the harsh world of reality how.
Pertinent is that they think this thing.
People call them crazy.
And the only safe spot is around the.
Other crazy people.
The only thing however that they didn't.
Fall through with was coming to.
The mixer yeah and and danny his.
Assistant apologized profusely said.
Logan had some other plans i did not.
Have other plans.
No we had to get the.
Out of that place the conference.
Was attached to the hotel so even when.
We went up to our rooms we were.
Surrounded.
We had to like live come flat and live.
With the people there was always times.
Where like they started to.
Seem like they might be catching on to.
Us like the second day.
One of the lead speakers that was the.
Biggest thing his name is mark sargent.
He was in the.
Behind the curve uh netflix documentary.
Which by the way.
If you haven't seen that it's incredible.
It pretty much sums up everything we're.
Saying he was on to us he found out that.
I was there and he went on a podcast and.
He's like.
Logan paul is a troll he's messing with.
Us i can't be around he didn't call me.
He was one of the main speakers and he.
Left he backed out yeah that led us into.
The third day.
When that happened like the last day and.
That's when people started to look at us.
Like.
We didn't belong there and as soon as.
That started to happen like i felt like.
Yo we're in.
Enemy territory we have to get out of.
Here like it was it was getting bad like.
People were starting to like say things.
To us yeah.
I was getting like    talked and.
Everything so so so we dipped we didn't.
Stay for the dinner we actually.
Moved hotels we went to uh downtown.
Denver to a.
Hotel there should we tell that story.
Yeah of course yeah.
So uh the whole documentary was made in.
Like three or four days it was so quick.
Filmed in three or four days but there.
Was so much thought that went into it.
And i was so stressed i mean we all were.
I'm so stressed out right now i'm.
Overwhelmed and i'm scared i'm scared.
For my life.
Remember the uh the clerks bro they were.
Flat earthers yeah at the new hotel.
You couldn't you couldn't escape them at.
That point we were asking everyone in.
The city what.
What shape do you think the earth is i.
Think it's what and she was like i think.
It's flat.
And then we went to that bar we went to.
The restaurant and he kept watching.
Videos of like flatter adamantly focused.
On this video and he was sweating like i.
Looked over at him he was just.
Completely like drenched in sweat and i.
Was like yo man like are you all right.
He was like i think i'm gonna go back to.
The room and he stood up and he started.
Walking down the hall.
You know when you stand up and you blood.
Rushes to your head yeah and.
There's like little clouds circle clouds.
Around your eyes but normally it goes.
Away the.
Circle of color kept getting smaller and.
Smaller and smaller.
And i'm walking down this long hallway.
Eventually i can't see i cannot.
See i'm still conscious.
But i'm blind and at this point like.
This has never happened to me so i lean.
Against this wall and i had.
Enough strength in my body to to muster.
One.
Final word and i'm leaning against this.
Wall and i go.
I ran over he was like leaning against.
The wall he was like.
I don't know man i don't feel good flat.
Earth like just started like saying.
Things and he was just so.
Up i think like just all of it.
Like the elevation like lack of sleep.
Like all the stress of like making the.
Film like everything we made it around.
The corner from the bar.
And literally as soon as we got around.
The corner he just face dived into the.
Ground like flat on the    ground.
For the first time in my life it like.
Was.
Out and so i picked them up i passed.
That big ass off pulled them into the.
Elevator.
And we were on the way back down like.
The door opened some guy tried to wheel.
A cart and he's like i'll just get the.
Next one.
I like dragged him all the way down here.
Like dragged all the way down your room.
This    took a toll on me is what.
We're saying like yeah i have never.
Passed out.
In my life the flat earthers made me go.
Unconscious and headbutt it was just.
Like so much it's like any time like.
You're like.
Trying trying your brain like that and.
Like expanding it and like i wouldn't.
Say expanding.
I don't hate the people i hate the.
Movement it's almost even.
Dumb to talk about like nasa astronauts.
Will not give this conversation the time.
Of day.
Neil degrasse tyson he hates it there's.
No point talking about it.
Well there's also that uh theory called.
Occam's razor which is uh the simplest.
Explanation tends to be.
The right one the flat earthers will use.
That in their defense and they'll be.
Like if they brought proof.
Of any of the stuff that they claim to.
Know like i feel like there's been.
Enough proof to show that the.
Earth is round do you still talk to the.
Australian girl that was in the movie.
She seems really nice k spoon she's a.
Good friend of ours and how did you find.
The girl who was also willing to pretend.
To ruin her reputation for the joke.
She trusted me i told her and like you.
Know sometimes when people trust me you.
Get.
In this scenario it worked out pretty.
Well she was good too.
She's never acted before the majority of.
Times it was you believed it too much.
You're like i need you to actually tone.
It down because no one's gonna believe.
It at the end yeah you know what's funny.
Hearing robbie describe our storyline.
Yeah after the fact but really it was.
Part of the storyline.
He was literally coming out as a flat.
Earther in his character.
Because he loved this australian girl.
Right that's another question we got.
Were you nervous to speak in front of.
The flat earth society they aren't the.
Flat earth society that's.
That's the difference like it's i just.
So dumb explaining i was a little.
Nervous and not because of public.
Speaking aspect i actually love public.
Speaking i love being on stage i was.
Nervous because.
That was the culmination of the entire.
Five-page script.
That was the big moment and i had one.
Chance to not    it up and not to.
Mention not only do i not think the.
Earth is flat.
I'm adamantly against this movement so.
500 eyes.
On me people who like live and die by.
This belief i couldn't    up.
And i i knew i had to nail it so yeah i.
Was nervous.
Penguin you guys are oh my god the.
Human-sized penguin.
We implanted the human-sized penguin in.
A lot of spots in this movie somebody.
Asked like what the relevance was.
There's no absolutely none whatever yeah.
I don't know what i don't remember what.
It was that got you so hung up on.
Because i was just hyped bro i think.
That was when i really started to.
Realize like how good this project was i.
Noticed all the throughout the through.
Lines.
Yeah between that applebee's so many.
Different like callbacks to applebee's.
Oh this was actually funny you'll notice.
On this script some things are in blue.
That's because this project was alive it.
Morphed and adapted.
So much based on what happened at the.
Conference we shot most of the stuff.
All of the stuff surrounding it after.
The conference because we had to know.
What went down for example the first.
Time.
The very first time the human-sized.
Penguin was mentioned was in my.
Interview with robbie just randomly set.
It off the top of my head.
In the ancient like jurassic times there.
Were penguins the size of humans.
Absolutely i was like yo i like that.
Let's    implant this and.
Everything so it's in the scene in the.
Woods there's a human.
Size penguin head in the background of.
The classroom scene in the music video.
The easiest way to put it about this.
Project was it just felt like what.
Happens when.
A group of people all start cooking on.
The same.
Wavelength all of us were just so dialed.
In to always be thinking about like what.
The next like.
Big thing could be we had prep the whole.
Team there was like seven of us.
We said yo do not break character ever.
Do not show these people that we are not.
Flattered don't talk too loud.
Don't say anything like we don't    we.
Were we were so serious about.
Not    up here like yo if you drop.
The ball and you're the one that.
This up do you have any idea how mad.
Dude we're gonna    be at you y'all.
Almost got caught.
Uh the one day i think it was a.
Publication called the daily beast oh.
Yeah that girl.
This girl came and she interviewed me.
And she's with her little camera phone.
And she.
Was asking me if i thought the earth was.
Flat and i wasn't sure.
Whether or not to come out on the media.
Yet as believing it.
And so like you like halfway there i.
Have waited.
Like crazy you're like the earth is flat.
Because our feet are flat.
And like let's see the curve just look.
At it and she was just like this dude is.
Such a       you know.
She's just the ending of that was tragic.
I was like yo the earth is flat.
Obviously and she's like do you have any.
Numbers for that and mike goes.
Are there any numbers in there or two.
Two two.
It's more just one in one when you.
Combine them yeah i broke.
Because that's what i hear yeah when the.
Flat earthers talk that's what i.
Hear them saying for their explanation.
That was like the first.
Piece of press that came out because.
Like i think a lot of people asked us.
About like the marketing for it as well.
The idea was.
To use the haters in the media give them.
A little piece of.
Something to snack on yeah some logan.
Paul hate the snack promote our film for.
Us.
And then make them eat their words when.
It came out and they did it.
By the grace we also did a little bit on.
Our end you know we talked about on the.
Podcast pretty much every podcast we.
Asked every guest yeah for the most part.
Is basically just seed the story.
And like let people run with it they.
Went live we had    ksi.
Tweeting about it bro like driving with.
A link.
Bro with a link to his six million.
Twitter fans and i was like yo this is.
One i knew you know like.
Yeah he said something like uh did i.
Really hit you that hard side no.
No you i mean i've said this before you.
Hit like a little.
How hard was it not to laugh on some of.
The scenes all the years i've ever.
Watched saturday night live.
And watch them struggle through scenes.
And like you see their like lips start.
To quiver and they're like starting to.
Fall off like.
I don't know how you did a lot of it.
Because a lot of your stuff was.
With the flat earthers and me too but i.
Think you had more because you had the.
Interviews with them it's like when you.
Asked robbie about the.
The human-sized penguin like i don't.
Know how you didn't break down this.
Here.
I could break and it would be okay like.
If you started cracking up when you were.
Asking robbie that    he would have.
Known well no what happened was when i.
Every time i would.
Want to laugh physically i was in pain i.
Was in pain it was so hard i.
Tried to empathize with these people but.
I just couldn't.
How long did it take to shoot the scene.
Where we were outside the restaurant.
So long in case you really rub it off.
Every time every time you said that.
Everybody that watches this movie has.
Like a different.
Line that makes them fall out dude it.
Makes them start cracking the pete line.
Or whether it's like when you when you.
Would say to the dude about masturbation.
And we like oh no but like yo literally.
The one.
Thing i could not stop breaking on was.
You saying.
Casey is really reeling off on me every.
Time you said it that was another random.
Improv.
Yo let's just have you start speaking.
Australia yeah that was that was not.
In the script you've only spent two days.
With her and you now have an australian.
Accent.
Are you gonna do more documentaries in.
The future absolutely we have ideas.
They can't be like this one cat's out i.
Mean sasha sasha obviously continues to.
Trouble people sasha baron cohen uniform.
Or whatever but like more than anything.
Like the thing that this hit me on was.
Just like it doesn't even feel like.
We're talking about documentaries we're.
Talking about filmmaking you know what.
I'm saying like we we sat.
Down we concepted we came up with the.
Storyline we wrote we had a script.
We acted in it we took things to the.
Next level.
For me the success was achieved i said i.
Was gonna get.
This i was gonna be happy this got 5.
Million views which is going to.
Yeah i also think it's this is going to.
Be a slow burn this project like in a.
Year.
I bet we'll check back it'll be at like.
10 20 million because it is a solid-ass.
Piece of content and.
It was exciting and fun to make so yeah.
Definitely want to do more i don't want.
To say the ideas yeah no.
Definitely not but look in conclusion.
Here's what you need to know uh.
P p p was real.
And he was i'm still    trolling.
I'm still in character they're uh we.
Don't we we don't think the earth is.
Flat that's the most important one and.
That's the only true one out of the.
Three he just said.
Well actually you know what again i said.
It in the dock like out like.
There's probably no earth if you think.
About it might as well not be.
Might as well not be but honestly like.
With the amount of    that i still get.
In my comments and dms i do not think.
That the earth is flagged say that with.
100 he had promised me i was going to be.
Able to break character.
Sooner he was like yo we go to the con.
We go to the conference you get out and.
Then literally you could go on the.
Podcast to talk about how it was all.
Food.
We get back he's like all right we gotta.
Film like two more months worth of.
Content i need you to hold character and.
Like people are attacking me i'm getting.
Up by the media whoever like.
People are coming on the podcast i got a.
Whole character.
But literally the whole from the.
Beginning of impulsive mike was yeah.
Yeah just if you notice during the.
During the impulsive scene.
The wall of pictures is one picture on.
It like this that's it this has been.
Yeah it's going for so long but i'm so.
Happy to come back out right now and say.
I'm not flattered one last thing i don't.
Want you guys to bully the flat earthers.
And i mean that like.
You don't have to agree with their.
Movement i guess make fun of it if you.
Feel like because it is.
Like quite honestly    stupid but.
Don't bully the people and.
Once again to the flat earth people to.
The flat earth community to robbie get.
Some proof for me dude like go.
Show me something show us something go.
To the go to antarctica next.
Don't have the 2019 conference take your.
Whole group of people.
And go to antarctica and find this ice.
Shelf.
That you tell everyone exists or find a.
Way to show us that the moon is its own.
Life give us.
Something to chew on because as of right.
Now you've got.
Absolutely nothing except for a group of.
People that.
Everyone is is doesn't believe like i i.
Don't know.
It's the blind leading the blind he's.
Not gonna.
He's not gonna go back you know how much.
Money he made off that conference you.

They were like two to five hundred.
Dollars and there's seven of us bro and.
The conference had like a thousand.
