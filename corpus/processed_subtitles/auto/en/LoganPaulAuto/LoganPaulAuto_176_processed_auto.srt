Be even a pro box at all.
I've never boxed before last year there.

The first fight i ever did there's.
15,000 people watching and a million.
Plus at home i went in there essentially.
Beat him up there wasn't a time to fight.
Where i felt threatened i'm ten times.
Better of a boxer an athlete than him.
I hate harder than unfossilized.
Everything better than him in the first.
Fight i should have won it i want to.
Fight most people thought i want to.
Fight if there was another round i would.
Have finished him for sure i'm going to.
Knock this kid the    out on november.

Life.
Music.
He's suggesting.
Both these guys clearly have a personal.
Disdain for each other they got very.
Heated.
Loden as the maturity of a 12 year old.
The kid wanted to eat my face.
And i felt that that cycle still the.
Look yeah right now they don't know what.
To do.
I noticed off the top that you know my.
Guy he knows how to throw punches he had.
A good job and he was quick no he's not.
Logan paul what you saw was him starting.
Really really fast this is where i.
Started to get cocky because i knew i.
Was faster than him right and i was.
Landing punches that he he wasn't robbed.
One i felt like the greatest boxer in.
The world i literally couldn't believe.
How much better i was in this man.
So i started taunting him cuz i'm an.
She's hoping to.
This is this is where it gets good.
Applause.
Applause.
Best combo in internet history.
Bro this is one china muscles don't.
Equal power it's out there look just out.
There look what you're gonna do what was.
That slightly win the respect buck.

Wasn't focused on like hey i should.
Probably end this fight as quickly as i.

I was just having fun being his first.
Right we never did it before you know he.
Didn't understand about stepping up to.
The plate after you know in combination.
He kinda i was looking at his work and.
I'm saying admire his work reach above.
It just just so important on the boys.

Round he said hey you won that round by.
The way stop showboating showboating i'm.
Winning this fight i'm fine.
Turns out i wasn't fine.
In this box.
Round three started zero all of a sudden.
I had nothing left i had no energy i can.
Barely pick up my arms and i couldn't.
Wrap my head around what just happened.
And why a little bit tight now i'm jj he.
Loves his job.
Applause.
In 6 min chicken hips now the question.
Is how do you get tired from only.
Flickinger i felt like it turned round 3.
And that's when i was like i need to get.
In his face and beat him up london.
Imagine those are straight oh my god i.
Was too stationaries a smart guy i let.
Him i let it set up for everything thank.

Ksi around because the pace changed.
Applause.
Applause.
There's so many times i could they just.
All finish their mind.
It's suck to like just see him getting.
Punched in the face but i know him.
Logan's not going down like that we're.
Tenants guys i promise you those new.
Damage this is a ton this is here i'm.
Unloading you know this right here when.
We know it means and we know what to do.
He gonna be tired from swinging like.
That yeah but logan this is a one two.
Around fight yeah i'm gonna keep it real.
If you just hit him with the jab the.
First ride he's gonna be so busy looking.
For that he gonna be frustrated you're.
Gonna be doing like this you already.
Doing like this it's like a small cloud.
Over his head you just calm down with.
Thunder.
Applause.
42 you stay on him you gotta stay here.
You go stay inside he don't like it no.
One can question your conditionals or.
Your chin yeah yeah he's conscious.
I'm telling you now if he hit hard you'd.
Be able to tell me i said come on come.
On stop there was a point in the fight.
Where case i got hit by like four.
Punches and i'm like okay he's gonna.
He's gonna beat this kids ass i don't.
Know what i thought i just knew he was.
Showing signs of weakness so i went for.
It as you sure champ in the fifth round.
I thought you know logan kind of got.
Control of himself and he was back to.
Straight punch and the atlanta some.
Great shots i thought was great for.
Frankly gt6 it up as if it's nothing.
Shockingly good with puppets i'm.
Changing this.
I literally do not remember my corner.
Telling me anything i went i blacked out.
I'd have no idea what they said i think.
At this time i said boy we need this.
Round we need to win this round this is.
When jj goes to tongue round six i'm.
Like this is gonna be the longest three.
Minutes of my life this is uh he's gonna.
Be tricky.
Applause.
Good shot good shot.
Keeping top of him whether his fitness.
Wasn't quite the same level over the.
Rounds he started to actually empties.
Ten in case i came back into the fight.
Times i thought case i might look to.
Stop him in the contest this was such a.
Crazy experience fighting with no energy.
For like two by two rounds now believing.
I'm winning the fight by the way and.
Just knowing that i got one more round.
To go just hold up and follow today.
The only rounds i give him was three and.
Six if that i can't really do a six shot.
It's really swinging the swinging.
Tell me he won the fight he finished.
That fight so strong logan had.
Absolutely nothing left 25 seconds she.
Was talking if there was another round i.
Would have finished him for sure not.
This year i couldn't believe what just.
Happened.
He's actually gasps these they're like.
Yes so many different thoughts are going.
Through my mind.
Milton whispered to me he goes it's good.
You didn't lose i'm like but i didn't.
Win okay so what's the point the.
Point is dissolved it's gonna be big.
It's gonna be very different and let's.
Hope he's prepared for it looking back.
In the fight you learn last year i kind.
Of knew what i was doing this year.
There's an animal inside me there's a.
Killer that i i suppress because he's.
Evil but on november 9th he's.
Gonna come out and it's not gonna be.
Pretty.
Last year i was just a white next five.
I'm ending his career you're gonna see.
Much better technique i'm gonna see look.
Like a professional fire it's a.
Different ballgame now you know i'm.
Seeing ksi doesn't respect a little bit.
I think i'm gonna come out you're gonna.
Stop on punished on november this is a.
Big moment i believe for professional.
Boxing we've seen the biggest stars in.
The world in a rematch said we need to.
Lose the head cuts and you got to use.
Tennis clubs the ones that really crack.
It might be a little bit surprised at.
Just how big some of those punches feel.
When you're not wearing headgear and.
You're wearing those 10 times closer.
Fight night they're like weapons dude it.
Feels like i'm holding lethal firearms.
In my hand one right hand and i'm.
Putting logan to sleep.
If someone is gonna step in the ring.
With me i'm gonna do everything in my.
Power to take over this person mentally.
And physically this is like a death.
Match he can punch me in the face and.
I'm still going to be that and then he.
Can punch me your face again i'm still.
Gonna be there and when he realizes i'm.
Still that it's gonna scare him the.
First fight is any indication these guys.
Are coming for each other and coming to.
Finish each other off.
Someone will get knocked down it won't.
Go six rounds lists amish rule and it's.
A real fire people curiosity want to see.
Who the hell is gonna win jj's.
Leadership is not just his physical.
Shrine.
It's the things you can't see and.
Measure great hunger the will to win yes.
He's a strong competitive man i'll guess.
What logan paul is going not clear sigh.
Oh cold.
I can't wait let's go champ you had.
People there's fans of both scott's at.
Fighting they're gonna watch a roofer.
There gosh.
That brings attention i know absolutely.

Spectacle i'm gonna beat the    out of.

Great's is knockouts of all time.
