Happened in the past four years or so i.
Just who i'm a rebel rouser so what are.
My prayers for my young stars or dear.
God don't let me be famous before my.
Brain is finished developing cuz fame.
Just does a whole number on.
Yes it does since the chronic stress and.
The whole world knows about it it's hard.
They diagnosed you with a vd as a child.
Never officially diagnosed i'm almost.
Positive i have some mild form of it but.
We never saw it as a bad thing you know.
A lot of my creativity is fueled by that.
Have you ever been treated for your.
Brain i had a skull fracture.
I have a millimeter skull fracture when.
I was in the seventh grade.
So anything that fractured her skull.
Generally hurts the right so her my.
Brains i have a titanium plate in my.
Head ashes i'm really glad you're here.
This could be a would be helpful really.
Do so we'll look at your brain i'll put.
The information in the context of your.
Life and if we get your brain better.
Your relationships are better your.
Judgment is better everything is better.
When the brain is not good.
You're not good so come with me this is.
Amazing this is great.
Music.
Oh yeah like open that yeah yeah hot.
Chocolate can you explain what this is.
Actually doing is gonna make a nice 3d.
Model of your brain showing us on the.
Inside what parts are active what parts.
Aren't which one should be which one.
Shouldn't be see if there's been any.
Damage from trauma chemical exposure.
Like that amazing.
Music.
Looks good oh great.
That's kind of nuts i could see it i.
Could see my brain from here all right.
Well we're truth we have some answers oh.
We do oh come in oh so the study we do.
Is called suspect and speck looks at.
Blood flow and activity it looks at how.
Your brain works and here's you see you.
Had actually a very significant injury.
He broke his skull he was in the seventh.
Grade and he goes but i didn't hurt my.
Brain and you see these holes.
I know parts of my brain are missing.
Well but this is it's not missing but.
It's hurt and this is really important.
Because right here is the most human.
Thoughtful part of us shut the it makes.
You human shut up so it's called the.
Frontal cortex was in humans than any.
Other animal so it's 30 percent of the.
Human brain and you heard it which means.
You're gonna have trouble with focus and.
Forethought and follow through an.
Organization planning empathy so for.
Lazy god and learning from the mistakes.
You make we need to fix us if we don't.
Fix this no matter how successful you.
Are it's going you're not going to make.
The decisions you need to move your life.
In the direction you go so there's there.
Is a reason yeah we either letting the.
Rest of your life with this brain is not.
Going to be a lot of fun for you or for.
The people who love you okay because.
You're gonna have trouble connect this.
Is the possibility that your brain could.
Look like just a fat full brain thick.
With 2 c's type of brain starts with you.
Have to love it it's like no i have to.
Care about my brain because if i don't.
I'm not going to.
You have to avoid anything that hurts it.
Drugs alcohol are you doing anything you.
Shouldn't be doing i drink a lot yeah i.
Drink like once a week but what i do i.
Go hard alcohol is not your friend.
It actually takes this and makes it look.
Worse imagine mike's brain broke we.
Don't do the right oh my god.
I don't want and when you drink your.
Brain probably looks like that and.
That's why people don't act right when.
They drink because they're damaging.
Their bra are you doing any high-risk.
Behaviors quite often yes so why don't.
You really think about it your problem.
Is i need click me yeah no you're gonna.
Be smarter about getting clickbait if i.
Fix your brain ah because i tell you to.
But you already know some of the things.
That work how can you be more thoughtful.
Blue is average red and white are the.
Most active parts of the brandon and.
Your cerebellum which is right here is.
Really good and this is the area right.
Here that according to a study from ucla.
It goes with intelligence they're smart.
Ah you're just not making the kind of.
Decisions help you yeah that sounds.
About right.
Our question is well can we make it.
Better are you like permanently messed.
Up or can we make this better.
We've got to fill in these holes i think.
It's more traumatic brain injury really.
Needs to be rehabilitated get rid of any.
High-risk behavior this can put you at.
Risk for another head injury because.
This brain is not going to tolerate a.
Lot more brain injury what about boxing.
Not if you're getting hit in the hat i.
Do have to kick one other youtubers ass.
And i have to box him one more time i.
Don't want you hurting your prey right.
So if you fight that guy you have to win.
And you have to protectors yeah oh yes.
I'll win for you doc i'm gonna win i.
Promise i won't damage my brain any more.
Than it already is and very few people.
Know that the trouble they have in life.
Is related to a head injury that.
Happened years ago every year he's in.
The united states there two million new.
Head injuries like the chronic effect we.
Shouldn't let kids hit soccer balls with.
Their head or play tackle football when.
I have kids i'm gonna make sure they.
Know like how dangerous football is.
American football what position did you.
Play linebacker and running back i was.
Always getting like his hiddenness you.
Didn't tell me that i thought this was.
Just the trampoline thing oh no i am i.
Was like the the katie with the coaches.
Like when the coach types me up about.
Basically sacrificing my body for the.
Sport i'm like okay high school coach.
And i'll never see again after these.
Years of my life and i listen to him and.
I offer up because of it and so the high.
School coach is not really thinking.
About what kind of husband you're gonna.
Be oh yeah dad you're good he cares.
About the game yeah people aren't.
Thinking about them yeah you have your.
Brain for the rest of your life yeah and.
So if you don't do anything this is just.
