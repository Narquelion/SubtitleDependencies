Applause.
Where's no juice.
Music.
Hey what's up that's me load money good.
Night i used to be a regular kid from.
Ohio you know i love sports i paid.
Attention in school it was always a bit.
Awkward but then when i was about 10.
Years old i picked up a video camera and.
Became logan paul butt heads yep i've.
Always been a bit of a troublemaker fast.
Forward this was me in 2016 which ended.
Up being the best year of my life.
Music.
Then this was me in 2017 which was an.
Even better year of my life so what the.
Happened in 2018 that made the.
World quiver when they heard the words.
Logan paul and paul logan paul and paul.
Logan paul obviously you know the answer.
But let's rewind for a second.
After becoming one of the top vine stars.
In the world the prestonby's vine by the.
Way i hopped from platform to platform.
Shooting viral sketch comedy bits some.
Of which you may have seen after about a.
Year i have gained about 25 million fans.
Between facebook instagram and twitter.
And then i heard about this thing called.
Daily vlogging.
Music.
What people of the internet my name is.
Logan paul and welcome to my vlog.
Channel that's right i'm vlogging now.
You get to see more of me i began my.
Youtube journey with a bulldoze.
Mentality i was gonna work my ass off to.
Overtake this platform with fresh.
Explosive quick pace and outlandish.
Content i wanted to conquer and destroy.
Sometimes quite literally everything in.
My path the bigger the faster the louder.
The better i wanted to make noise so i.
Did.
We became the fastest channel to hit ten.
Million subscribers in the history of.
Youtube and i told myself that i was.
Gonna blow any competition i had out of.
The water which at one point became my.
Own brother.
And that got ugly.
Applause.
And slowly but surely in my endless.
Pursue of more views and more.
Subscribers it was becoming clear that.
The vlog mentality was getting out of.
Hand.
But i did not see that here's what i saw.
Oh mamma mia take a look around.
Oh joey look so good at night boy just.
Dropped 40k on a presidential role.
Within the bags eleven thousand six.
Hundred dollars worth of gucci clothes.
Oh is this solid gold solid gold twenty.
Thousand dollars it is yours that's my.
Board the machine was beginning to take.
On a mind of its own as my hunger for.
Success was growing exponentially so was.
My ego the line for what was acceptable.
It became more and more foggy and the.
Disrespect began to skyrocket.
And it's not that i felt the rules.
Didn't apply to me i knew they did i.
Just didn't care about the consequences.
If i broke them i didn't even consider.
Them no god i wanted to entertain my.
Audience every single day without of.
This world content and behavior that.
They could only find on local vlogs.
Consequences were rarely even an.
Afterthought.
And not to mention i was the 22 year old.
Blond-haired blue-eyed kid from ohio.
With 45 million followers on the.
Internet every single day my actions.
Were validated by five to seven million.
Viewers and as long as i wasn't doing.
Any harm no one was trying to stop me.
Now my peers not my family not even.
Members of my own team.
Music.
Applause.
And then in december of 2017 i went to.
Japan it was the perfect storm of.
Circumstance ignorance ego and downright.
Stupidity the backlash against the.
Social media star who posted video of an.
Apparent suicide victim is intensifying.
The video viewed over 6 million times in.
Just 24 hours in youtube star logan paul.
Is facing the fallout after posting a.
Video that showed the body of an.
Apparent suicide victim in the backlash.
Was massive people and creators of all.
Sizes denouncing logan paul and this.
Video actor aaron paul sang logan paul.
Go to hell so many people sharing.
Stories of people they lost due to.
Suicide and some specifically hanging i.
Obviously as a person as a human being i.
Was frustrated and pissed off and.
Offended by his actions a hero for a lot.
Of kids is to logan fans and when i see.
That i care so much.
I'm so disgusted how could somebody now.
Realize how    up this is this.
Crosses the line and i am not surprised.
That he would do something like this it.
Doesn't make any sense to me whatsoever.
As a human being how about a little bit.
Of empathy like a normal human being.
Instead of being a    go to a morgue.
If you're that    more big he.
Thought that that was a key thing to do.
In less than 24 hours i became the most.
Hated person on the planet i had made an.
Inexcusable mistake completely destroyed.
My image lost every professional.
Relationship that i had became the.
Internet's favorite meme and most.
Importantly had my eyes opened wide to.
The consequences of my actions.
I felt every ounce of disappointment and.
Hate directed at me and while it was a.
Hundred percent my fault it was critical.
That i felt all of it now here's where i.
Made a significant mistake i went into.
Panic mode.
Music.
Being disliked was my biggest fear in.
The entire world so and is scrambled to.
Try and reverse the past i asked myself.
How do i fix this when instead the.
Question i should have been asking was.
How do i fix me.
I took a month break from the internet.
And attempted to bounce back with an.
Anti suicide psa in a donation but i was.
Still moving too fast i didn't fully.
Understand the significance of my.
Actions the depth of the pain they.
Caused and was literally becoming my own.
Worst nightmare.
Pretty much i know for a fact everything.
I do from this point on will get.
Criticism it will get backlash so.
Internet please don't use me bro crucify.
Me vilify me as i fell more and more out.
Of touch with reality i couldn't trust.
Myself i wouldn't send my team the.
Videos for a review i didn't listen to.
My friends and i refused to adapt my.
Content it was the highest degree of.
Self-sabotage.
Music.
But finally after nearly running the.
Rest of my life into the ground.
I received a blessing in disguise.
You said before this fight you have.
Something planned is there anything you.
Want to say to someone out ose matt's.
Got this bout right now and the youtuber.
Wants it you can come get it take paul.
No can porn and there's a port i don't.
Care i saw this as an opportunity to.
Turn my disoriented emotions into fuel.
After everything that had happened since.
January this was my chance to truly.
Truly take a step back from the internet.
And focus on something else with the.
Unrelenting passion that i knew i had i.
Knew that i had more to offer in this.
World and i did not want to let my.
Failure define me.
Little did i know i had been preaching.
This message the whole time and if you.
Lose if you fail fine in fact please let.
Me fail let me let me lose if you can.
Take a hit in the face and get back up.
And learn from it that is a win consider.
That a win because you are now better.
And stronger than you were in the past.
It's just like working out you work out.
You work out you work out you deplete.
Your muscles you take your protein shake.
And then your muscles heal and you're.
Stronger than you were before it's the.
Same exact thing.
During the six months of four hours of.
Daily training i rekindled my.
Relationship with my brother i fell in.
Love with a girl who absolutely changed.
My life and i restructured my business.
And focused on my mental health and.
Emotional growth.
Music.
Thank god for the people around me in.
The support of you guys because i don't.
Know how else i would have gotten.
Through this year or out of my own way.
And although the fight was a draw.
Whack is    it turned out to be the.
Biggest event in internet history and.
I'm looking forward to the rematch next.
Year.
Applause.
Music.
Applause.
As i've matured this year i've gotten to.
Exercise my creativity in different ways.
With the number one podcast in the world.
Called impulsive a documentary about the.
Flat earth which is coming in january.
And i'm hitting 2019 hard by releasing a.
Show called best friends that i shot.
With evan an animated storytime series.
About crazy    that's gone down in my.
Life as well as reviving the vlogs i'm.
Growing into who i am and what i want to.
Make versus trying to fit into the mold.
Of youtube personality or be someone who.
I'm simply not the things you've been.
Went through this year have you shared.
Yet on this podcast or on your vlog -.
Three biggest lessons you learned from.
This year what's that what's the one you.
Share the one is slow down it is the.
First thing that comes to my mind and i.
Can not point to that as the reason for.
What happened the singular reason for.
What happened but that is a that is huge.
What would be less number two the.
Biggest lesson of the year lesson number.
Two.
Music.
Listening happen what way listen to the.
People around you listen to what they're.
Saying listen to your audience listen to.
Your friends listen you're family you're.
Not right about everything or logan will.
Be a third one biggest lesson that you.
Think will transform not only your.
Business your brand your empire but also.
Your life in 2019 and beyond i think.
Empathy i think i think being aware of.
People beyond just yourself.
Granted i'm still young and i still have.
A lot to learn and by no means am i.
Saying i've learned everything and i'll.
Never make another mistake because i'm.
Far from perfect and i'm nowhere near.
The man i want to be but the best thing.
I can do is keep striving to listen.
Learn grow feel and adapt.
Now one year later although i can't say.
2018 was the best year of my life i can.
Absolutely say this has been the most.
Cathartic and important year of my life.
This year and how i move forward will.
Forever to find the type of man that i.
Am in the mission i'm on i'm blessed to.
Be able to continue doing what i love.
And i want to thank all of you for your.
Support and if you're like me and you're.
Ever feeling low like the weight of the.
World has been stacked on your shoulders.
Even if it is a fault of your own just.
Remember it could always get worse but.
It will always get better.
Music.
Who knows 2018 might end up being the.
Best year of my life but i got a lot.
More to go.
Music.
Music.
You.
