To enjoy i'm a space geek bro and when i.
Found out there was a solar eclipse.
Happening this year i was like oh you.

A bit hot outside if it gets too hot can.
I use that rolex to say i is mom boy the.
Boys are getting scientific yul brynner.
What are you doing bro building our.
Filter cuz guys the sun is so strong.
That you need something to protect the.
Lens it would melt the inside of the.
Camera.
That's scientifical actual factual guys.
This is josh by the way he's gonna be.
Helping us hold up bro.
Is that jake palmer shine you know okay.
The water broke localized oh yeah yeah.
Yeah okay we're gonna test this.
Concoction so it's crazy because in real.
Life this looks like a solid piece of.
Foil when you pointed at the sun it.
Doesn't look like a solid piece of foil.
This is funny because we're gonna be.
Doing a bunch of scientific stuff today.
We don't know what the hell we're.
Talking about yeah science.
Resonant.
What do you see i think i see the sun.
Where's this damn it cliff it's coming.
Bro we have like an hour of speaking of.
That colby bro we got to get going soon.
We're gonna miss ya as usual guys we're.
Running late yes i refuse to mr. solar.
Eclipse i would rather my brother lose.
All his subscribers actually kind of.
Happen the other day i'm just gonna.
Here's the deal low gang i must be some.
Facts it's actually factually the last.
Time a solar eclipse like this occurred.
Was in 1979 it was pretty cool to see.
Here check.
While the footage isn't that amazing the.
Last total eclipse of the sun for north.
America for the year 2017 well guess.
What mr. newsman its 2017 also i'm not.
Sure if this is true but this is what.
I've been saying solar eclipses like.
This is only gonna happen once in our.
Lifetime what that means i don't know.
Maybe just like across america again i'm.
Not sure i think that is what it means.
It is america so a solar eclipse like.
This probably will happen elsewhere in.
The world this one is the great american.
Solar eclipse and it's only gonna happen.
Once in our lifetime u.s. totally we are.
Headed to a private airport apparently.
When the eclipse happens there's like a.
360 degree sunset so this particular.
Airport has like a lot of space we're.
Going to see all of it hopefully not.
Sure whose idea it was to run up in an.
Airport senator hasn't so much as we.
Love you heather and you know you but.
You sound.
Music.
All probably hebrew set up dogs that are.
$14,000 lamb shot whatever.
Brendan made this morning don't i think.
I'm gonna chase you solar eclipse and.
I'm gonna get you engaged or slip and we.
Can show these doors i too easy to be.
Blasted amazing as cochran oh my god yes.
This is a little sketchy i love it.
Okay guys does the reason we chose the.
Rooftop obviously like i said so take a.
Look around guys.
Everywhere that we can you the sun will.
Be setting it is curly up there i decide.
I'm margot paul okay we can see anything.
That's my boy.
I got you of it yeah we are going to go.
Back up there later that's the viewing.
Flooded part i will say yo it's really.
Hot and i heard when the moon covers the.
Sun the temperatures drop a little bit.
Some wait for that because you are.
Freaking burning that bro i'll be a.
Jonas brother did it that's if you get.
That reference.
Thanks also most people don't know.
That i majored in engineering in college.
What does that have to do with space.
Nothing nothing but here's our solar.
Eclipse or logan i'm a teacher of.
Science in a fun way.
Evan call me come here okay so this is.
What we do so let's pretend evan is the.
Moon and colby is the sun normally if.
The moon ever crosses the sun it doesn't.
Matter because it doesn't completely.
Cover it so that rarely happens but.
Today given our current location on.
Planet earth the moon is going to cover.
The sun in such a way that it completely.
And fully blocks out the sun so normally.
Maybe the moon possibly sound like this.
You think nothing of sometimes the moon.
Crosses the sun like this again still.
Nothing where you saw we're like partial.
Solar eclipse.
But today the moon is going to did i get.
Ya edgar do that where it completely.
Covers the sun for a duration of two and.
A half minutes during that time the.
Earth will get pitch black like it's.
Nighttime.
Apparently you'll be able to see stars.
And the planet venus animals will start.
Acting differently that's why i brought.
Kong i want to see what he does.
Apparently able to hear like crickets.
Chirping because you know they all think.
It's night time to quit idiots it's just.
A neglect sigh to all the animals who.
Wants to have logs just to remember just.
Gives you merch link in description logo.
Balkon  shot one thing i forgot to.
Mention is during the eclipse we yeah we.
Get to wear these really cool-looking.
Eclipse glasses mmm these are these are.
Super cool look at eyes this feel like.
I'm at the premiere for spy kids 3d it's.
Crazy guys because i can't see anything.
It's absolutely pitch black the only.
Thing i could see is the sun oh evan oh.
That is oh i know what evan we're not.
Yet.
Sure look brendon can you see through.
Them nope i told you pitchblack that way.
We don't burn our eyes when we look at.
The sun that would be bad.
Hey guys so life wouldn't be life.
Without problems one we are experiencing.
Right now this lens is like breaking of.
The brendon what's happening bro it just.
Says it won't communicate with this.
Camera no oh.
$14,000 lady we tried that camera we.
Tried brendan's camera that lens was.
Going to capture like an extreme closeup.
Of the moon covering the sun the worst.
Part about this is that it's 1151 or an.
Hour's point of contact with the moon.
Touches the sun is in eight minutes so.
We should just speed this is the third.
Camera body and still in air this is no.
Bueno.
Stop dog do you know how to fix it i.
Don't know what happened so i can use on.
How did you find this game ran out on.
Time accident lenzburg brendan oh yes.
So what's the delay $14,000 then it.
Works anything nah don't want to rush.
Anyone but we got about four minutes.
Look i literally just got the.
Notification or its contact in two.
Minutes you guys thank you rose we have.
One minute climbing up this ladder i do.
Not want to miss first contact i'm.
Reckless and i'm crazy but i'm also a.
Geek my awesome solar glasses are going.
On i don't know where my people are.
Maybe i'm the only one that wants to.
Appear playful a journey for we make of.
It brendan.
It'll roll on it anyway okay doctor felt.
Their first contact about the habit you.

59 a.m. is it if you come over the.
Top right.
Oh snap yo so we're all just sitting.
Here waiting for totality to happen we.
Have about one hour.
Yo this lens think its not good try to.
Figure out what we can do so we can see.
The moon covering the sun like way close.
Up that footage you saw earlier was from.
This camera and it just doesn't do it.
Justice kind of santa bro.
Pitch fortune does no such look at this.
One i wish i could just grab the lens.
Like oh you good boy.

This one over here not as big as the big.
Lion slide is going to have to work in.
Fact right now you can see that the moon.
Is covering maybe more than like.
Three-quarters of the sun when the moon.
Completely covers the sun a couple.
Things are going to have one there's.
Going to be like i heard anyways look.
I'm not a scientist brahma blocker but i.
Heard there's going to be a ringer on.
The sun and if you have a lens that can.
Get close enough to see the moon you can.
See the sun shining through the ridges.
Of the moon there's going to be like a.
Big flash when it like finally happened.
At which point it will get dark will see.
The stars the blah blah blah blah yeah i.
Think it's good time guys i'm aware this.
Might not make sense but this its.
Physical weird energy right now it's.
