I've made a severe and continuous lapse.
Of my judgment and i don't expect to be.
Forgiven i'm simply here to apologize so.
What we came across that day in the.
Woods was obviously unplanned and the.
Reactions you saw on tape were raw they.
Were unfiltered none of us knew how to.
React or how to feel i should have never.
Posted the video i should have put the.
Cameras down and stopped recording what.
We were going through there's a lot of.
Things i should have done differently.
But i didn't and for that from the.
Bottom of my heart i am sorry i want to.
Apologize to the internet i want to.
Apologize to anyone who's seen the video.
I want to apologize to anyone who has.
Been affected or touched by mental.
Illness or depression or suicide but.
Most importantly i want to apologize to.
The victim and his family for my fans.
Who are defending my actions.
Please don't they do not deserve to be.
Defended the goal with my content is.
Always to entertain to push the.
Boundaries to be all inclusive in the.
World i live in i share almost.
Everything i do.
The intent is never to be heartless.
Cruel or malicious like i said i've made.
A huge mistake i don't expect to be.
Forgiven i'm just here to apologize i'm.
Ashamed of myself i'm disappointed in.
Myself and i promise to be better i will.
Be better thank you.
