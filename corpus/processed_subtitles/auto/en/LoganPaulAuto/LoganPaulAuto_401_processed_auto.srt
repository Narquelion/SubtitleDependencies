Hey everybody.
It's me youtube's bad boy i know i need.
To shave my beard i know i look like a.
Homeless man i know i've been gone for a.
While but i'm back with bad news um my.
Appeal got denied i can't say i did not.
See this coming and for those of you who.
Do not know my appeal i appealed the two.
Points that the ref took away from me.
And my boxing fight against ksi which is.
The reason i lost so ksi has officially.
Without a question or doubt won the.
Fight against me you know it's not great.
I mean you know if i'm being honest it.
Stings i hate to lose it mostly stings.
Though because i shot myself in the foot.
Like i quite literally only lost because.
Of my actions shoutout to andy foster in.
The california state athletic commission.
For giving this the due diligence that i.
Think it deserved but even they said in.
Their denial of the appeal i followed.
Some of your comments in social media.
And you stated that you don't feel like.
You lost or something to that effect.
This may be because you won the rounds.
With points by two judges you lost this.
Boxing contest due to the files.
Committed in the subsequent point.
Deduction ksi won the match under the.
Rules of the commission you were ahead.
On two cards thank you for the chapstick.
Danny.
But ksi won the net points due to point.
Deductions from the puf productions from.
The files you committed just yet another.
Case of like literally it's i took an l.
In life only because of me and i even.
Said this before the fight i understood.
That case i was in the ring with me but.
The only person i was really fighting.
Against was myself and i lost that fight.
So i'm optimistic for the day where i.
Can stop being my own worst enemy and.
Become my biggest supporter because once.
Again i've shot myself in the foot you.
Know it's disappointing but i'll move on.
I'll live and i will be fighting again.
And next time hopefully i don't make.
Myself lose the fight so ksi congrats.

What i was thinking on the night of the.
Fight i knew if i don't make this video.
Now i probably never will and for.
Everyone wondering what it's like to.
Compete in what might be the biggest.
Internet event of 2019 boxing.
Professionally for the first time in.
Front of like what like 15,000 people at.
The staples center it's absolutely.
Insane also there's some things that.
We're going through my head that you.
Definitely didn't know about that i'm.
Gonna tell you about now and just kind.
Of iterate my thoughts so i go to do my.
Ring walk bieber's behind me but somehow.
He gets like drowned out because every.
Everyone's so tight it's such like a.
Tight walkway and i'm trying to like.
Stay focused but at one point i'm.
Literally almost walking sideways not to.
Mention if you look in my eyes you can.
Pretty much see death i'm sick as.
Like under my eyes like blue and.
Purple ksi does his ring walk he's got.
This big big red cloak and a face mask.
He's got you can barely see him i'm.
Literally out here first professional.
Boxing match representing my country.
Wearing red white and blue and i'm.
Getting hella goosebumps and also.
Wondering how the    am i about to.
Pull this off given the fact that i can.
Barely breathe this is super telling.
Right here and i didn't see him at this.
Point but just looking back right here.
It's so obvious to me that he was in the.
Zone like my man is in flow state he's.
Focused he's locked and he's even.
Talking to himself right now.
It looks like he's saying i want this i.
Want this and i've always said this.
About ksi the dude just like he's got.
This like sick mental toughness that.
Probably contributes to a lot of his.
Success and his success on this night.
But this man just wanted it and look.
It's just evident how focused he is so.
They bring us to the center and i'm.
Definitely locked in it i'm not not.
Focused like i'm.
Looking at his body i'm trying to figure.
Out where i'm gonna pick my shots and.
Where i'm gonna hit him and then this is.
It dude this is the big moment months.
And months of talking the first fight.
Was a draw this is the moment that the.
Whole entire world has been waiting for.
And then i just went i can let everyone.
Down i was just kidding not really.
Anyway robbed one who's the king of.
Social media man comes off jabbing right.
Away.
He keeps jabbing at my body he lands a.
Couple good ones trying to feel each.
Other out a little bit right there that.
He throws a big big overhand right which.
By the way is what we trained for we.
Know that's his that's his bread and.
Butter punch and it misses and and as.
Soon as it missed i realized that not.
Much really has changed with his.
Fighting style last year i had one hand.
Down that was fought with my hands down.
And this year you know i'm a little more.
Up a little more like cat-like ready to.
Take on punches but he was still.
Throwing these big wild punches which i.
Think is actually why he got tired much.
Quicker than i did finally these two can.
Get it on faking a little bit and he.
Keeps throwing in my body which made me.
Think he was he was setting something up.
A little bit and yeah just getting a.
Little scuffle here i'm trying to hit.
His kidneys in his liver.
Again just can't side with them with the.
Big overhand right not much is really.
Happening here this again this round was.
Kind of slow but i gotta say it's crazy.
This is my first time actually watching.
The fight in full and it is crazy to see.
How packed this arena is just watching.
Two youtubers beat the    out of each.
Other i knew that when i would throw.
Case i would throw too so i was a little.
Hesitant to use my right hand cuz every.
Time i did he would go crazy and i'm not.
Really an emotional fighter on more.
Strategic so i didn't want to get caught.
With some stupid yeah i mean this dude.
Is everywhere it's like you you you go.
For something and he just starts.
Flinging his arms everywhere.
Yeah so i was while i was looking for.
That check hook a lot and he managed to.
Avoid it but uh i got close a couple.
Times it's clear to me that ksi is.
Getting tired and to be honest i like.
That i like that but yeah it's the end.
Of the first round and i noticed he was.
Breathing heavy and in the press.
Conferences he was talking about how.
Hard he worked and i did that last year.
I worked incredibly hard but i was.
Cognizant that he might have over.
Trained and i think he did cuz he got.
Tired after like three rounds and i.
Think you start to see it there but he.
Definitely won that round for sure he.
Was more active than i was before the.
Fight actually i told my team i was like.
Hey guys i have to start slow like i.
Need my adrenaline to kick in probably.
Around like around 2 or 3 because i just.
I don't feel good and i'm not gonna be.
Able to like go hard right off the bat.
So ya know first around the cavitation.
Braun 2 begins kind of the same old like.
Still figuring each other out i'm still.
Slow i'm using my jabs sometimes and i.
Connected a couple really good ones this.
Boy.
Swings who big punches and he shows them.
So they're pretty easy to dodge but i'm.
Telling you if he hits me with one of.
Those you know my head's flying off so.
Just a little jab there let him know i'm.
Still here like don't another jab to the.
Face another jab my friends made fun of.
Me that in for my right hand in there.
And watching back there absolutely right.
Like i'm literally only using my left.
Hand so i'm aiming for the body right.
Now kind of tricking him and then a nice.
Jab to the head and like i said i landed.
A lot of jabs in this fight there's a.
Lot of pictures that came out of his.
Face just like crumpled up and my left.
Hand just planted right in his noggin i.
Just wish i would have done that with my.
Right hand.
No i'm saying so it's starting to heat.
Up a little bit again i'm just i'm jab.
Central just jab as much as i possibly.
Can cuz it's like i'm still waiting for.
My body to wake up.
Music.
Bro i'm barely barely missing these.
Punches which is my style i'm a counter.
Puncher kind of and so when i slip or.
Move i'm purposely like you're missing.
Me by like this much watching it back.
Announcer set it right there i know i.
Know he keeps throwing these wild.
Punches and i don't care who you are you.
Cannot do that for six for six to twelve.
Rounds he's not using his energy well.
And i see he's getting tired that's true.
I'm a believer now it's in my instagram.
Bio thank you justin i love you bro so.
In the replay yeah check that out that's.
It just that just to just two real good.
Jabs and a third one and then we're just.
It's just a swing fest.
And then this punch right here that was.
The first punch where i was like i was.
Like ah ten ounce gloves no head guards.
I see round three starts this is where.
It gets interesting case i just missing.
Punch i could see him running out of.
Energy he's breathing heavier that was.
Weird he looked to his coaches for some.
Reason which i've never seen any boxer.
Do in the middle of the round he just.
Like looked at his coaches and i don't.
Know why i didn't like punch him in the.
Face but it was also like a body.
Language thing like it was a sign of.
Retreat and assignment that he was.
Exhausted and even like he's against the.
Ropes and everything i like i literally.
Hate myself for not capitalizing on that.
I know i got in trouble for the foul.
Later but this kid kept hitting me in.
The back of the head when we would lock.
Up and here was the ears i think one of.
The first time she did it like just.
Laying in the back a head so i tell the.
Ref jack reese i'm like yeah hit he hits.
Me in the back of the head and his.
Response was in hindsight completely.
Inappropriate and jack reese i.
Want you to know bro i'm not happy with.
You that's wrong it at all oh yeah he.
Yells he yells at me in the middle of my.
The biggest event of my life he goes.
Relax.
Did he kill you i got you relax box he's.
D treated it like two youtubers fighting.
Instead of like a typical boxing match.
But anyways i'm being a whiny.
Let's watch.
Not looking too good here okay so right.
Here right here yes i swings in me and.
Then he swings again and he hits me like.
Kind of in the back of the head and i.
Grab his legs and he pulls back and i'm.
On the floor it looks like i'm about to.
Take him down and obviously this has.
Never happened to me before.
So i look up at jack reese oh my god was.
That a knockdown i'm not really sure and.
He's like no get out cuz like i was.
Waiting for him to start counting but he.
Did it and i got up and i was fine but i.
Was just sort of confused at what just.
Happened.
Knuckle i am i'm holding a lot did.
Boxing boxing is tough for me dude i got.
It i said i still have a lot to learn in.
Boxing i'm just like an mma guy and i.
Think my wrestling background lends.
Itself really nicely to just like.
Clinching people so as round 3 is coming.
To a close ks eyes movements are getting.
A little slower he's breathing heavier.
He's not punching as fast and then it's.
Live this happens in practice all the.
Time i have long legs i took a step too.
Far back and there was nothing i was off.
The the mat but yeah round 3 is clearly.
Not not a great round for me so check it.
Out i get to the corner.
Shannon cook you can see he goes he goes.
What are you doing i'm like what the.
Are you doing and i tell him i'm.
Like i don't know i just still like.
Wasn't quite present but i knew he was.
Tired and i knew i was gonna have to.
Capitalize now so yeah this was the.
Knockdown yeah he got me like in the.
Back of the head and i sort of grabbed.
Him it's so funny i go i go immediately.
Back to my wrestling roots yeah i'm.
Actually to be honest to be surprised.
That jack reese did not count that as a.
Knockdown you know i'm not the ref but.
Also like like i'll um i don't know how.
You make that mistake all right.
The controversial round for.
Applause.
You know in the corner nothing wrong.
With it ah that was literally i think.
The first right hand that i threw in.
This fight it took me four rounds to.
Throw one right hand.
Anyways i can tell jj's getting a little.
Sloppy with it he's getting a little.
Tired he throwing lazy punches lazy jabs.
Okay so right now i'm setting him up and.
I'm waiting for him to do something dumb.
And he does right there connect with a.
Beautiful uppercut and then k scy gets.
Up he stumbles to the corner he's.
Complaining cuz i i had tapped him in.
The back of the head jack reese he.
Brings me to the neutral corner and yeah.
This this is this is was the most.
Beautiful uppercut thrown that night.
Just like absolutely devastating and i.
And i have done this in practice a lot.
You slip a jab and come underneath and.
That one connected my left hand was like.
Happened to be around his neck because i.
Think i threw a hook that failed and i.
Just kept it there and then hit him.
Again with our uppercuts which by the.
Way that's like a legal punch we've seen.
In boxing it's probably not it's.
Probably frowned upon but if you do it.
Like once in the heat of the moment like.
This i shouldn't be penalized for it.
This is the one he goes down and he's.
Like still on my legs so i tap him in.
The back of the head.
It wasn't crazy hard but still i did it.
And yeah that did that quite literally.
Is what cost me the fight so jack freese.
Tells me he's waving it off and and by.
The way when he does i'm i i i'm i see.
Jj recovering sucking air and i also saw.
Him get up and stumble to his corner.
Like this was my opportunity and i know.
Time is ticking he's probably still not.
Quite present and this would have been.
My opportunity to to finish him off but.
Yeah myself two points jack reese the.
Ref is apparently one of the best in the.
Game but uh you know quite honestly i.
Beg to differ.
Jack i'm sure you're a great guy but you.
Missed ksi is knocked down earlier and.
This two points thing was.
Music.
I know you're a realtor bro and i want.
You to know i will never be buying a.
House from you yeah so the fight the.
Fight picks up again and and to be.
Honest with you i should have gone balls.
To the wall here i know for a fact case.
I was not fully recovered and for some.
Reason i was still holding back i will.
Quite literally never forgive myself for.
The rest of my life for not just.
Unleashing on him yeah you could tell.
Like his movement he's just he keeps.
Walking back and back and back and uh.
Girl yeah bro this uppercut oh boy you.
Got    up oh my god i just have a.
Problem with okay so boxing right it's a.
Fight but also not really there's some.
Rules there's a lot of things you can't.
Do which is why i truly believe i i need.
To do mma so you know dana white.
Bellator the zone set it up here we go.
So round five starts you can see i'm.
Picking up the pace a little bit and.
Throw some more punches but still not.
Enough not like i should be and my.
Conditionings pretty good to be honest.
With you like i'm okay.
I noticed he's tired and he's probably.
Still not really 100% there whew jab jab.
Jab okay aside with the big punches he's.
Missing i know he's getting tired and at.
This point it's hard for me to get over.
The mental mountain that the two points.
Were taken away like that really me up.
Which is a lesson for me like i can't.
Let i can't even if an obstacle is.
Thrown in my path and you think i know.
This by now i can't let it get to me and.
I still got to keep fighting.
Yes sir round 5 ends sorta uneventful.
We're at around 6 the championship round.
So yeah in the corner before the the six.
Round.
Shannon's telling me he's saying yo you.
Want to go home tired and he told me.
This in the locker room too no matter.
What happens tonight go home tight don't.
Go home with energy know that you you.
Left it all out there in the ring and to.
Be honest with you i didn't and i don't.
Know why because it's so unlike me to to.
Half-ass something but quite literally i.
Was half-assing this fight this is one.
Of two moments in my life where i felt.
Like i was watching my life happen like.
A movie and there was nothing i could do.
About it like an out-of-body experience.
Almost last round championship round.
Round six do we get the stoppage it well.
Just start swinging for the fences it's.
Crazy we both know we gotta activate.
Pretty solid in the money that punch.
Right there i remember it was it was a.
Body shot and i really liked that punch.
It's a hook to the body but i remember.
It connected he goes kind of like i did.
Last year but he did a good job of.
Hiding it i know i know he felt that one.
See this is like right there it's clear.
That ksi just he wants it more that's.
All there is to it that's what it came.
Down to like we're both moderately good.
At boxing.
We're both we both got massive egos but.
This night on november 9th case i wanted.
The win more than i did so there's about.
10 seconds left in the fight you know we.
Both just kind of like start lazily.
Swinging holding each other waiting for.
It to be over and then.
He's gonna have to do it bell rings.
Round six is over and i i knew i didn't.
Have it to be honest with you i looked.
At jake and i was like yo he he won that.
One right and he's like nah man you did.
Great i was like yeah but he met he won.
It and he was being weird with me and so.
Like oh look watching this fight right.
Now even is making me extremely hungry.
And like people warned me about the.
Dangers of boxing but like i really do.
Love the sport and i unfortunately i.
Can't end on a loss so i mean whoever.
Wants this smoke who could come get it.
In case i is a tricky person to fight.
Because it's it's hard to train for.
Someone who doesn't really have any.
Technique he's just got a big heart.
Logan wall so the one judge had me.
Winning by one point another judge had.
Ksi winning.
Scores the contest 5655 and the last.
Judge decision victory ksi so just a.
Hella hella emotional celebration he.
Falls to the floor and and you know.
That's super cool to see like this man.
This might work just as hard as i did to.
Get this victory and i i'm incredibly.
Happy for him and i i'm like i said i'm.
Excited to see what he does next and.
It's weird like you can see me like.
Register the loss and i think at one.
Point i like grabbed my chest and i'm.
Like how how cuz i literally just like.
If it's stung especially cuz i i was.
Doing the calculation in my head if i if.
I did not get the two points taken away.
From me i would have won the fight but.
Again what a shoulda coulda next time.
I'm not gonna be an idiot and then you.
Know everyone saw ksi and i we'd apt up.
At the end we settled the beef although.
It still might be half i don't i don't.
Know dude i'm on the ready to move on to.
The next portion of my life which will.
Most definitely include fighting because.
It's super exciting and i think you guys.
Like it but i'm being honest with you.
Come on back to vlogs dawg come 2020.
