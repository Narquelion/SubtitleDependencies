Changed my life that was a gunshot.
Oh it's fireworks no there's no problem.
Okay here's i need i have something to.
Say if you guys remember every piece of.
Merch that we sold during the month of.
April we were gonna do a one-for-one.
Giveaway so you buy a maverick hoodie.
And we give one to a kidney okay i'm not.
Gonna lie dude being around kids like.
Just perpetuates my want of a kid wanna.
Kid well you have to get on my toes job.
Failed are you gonna judge the kids by.
What they choose the ones that you get.
Pork rinds i can't really like takis how.
Much money was on google preferred whoo.
Crazy mom now i would say like enough to.
Buy like two bags of funyuns.
Girl whose name i still don't know.
That's right kid.
Me minnie that's who i am.
I forgot to get a snack we bully a kid.
To give us a snack completely counteract.
Everything i love seem you get life.
Lessons from little girls i wish i had.
The empathy you had.
Music.
Wow.
Yeah remember when i said i wanna kiss i.
Changed my mind.
Oh right biting extremely underestimated.
Exactly what it is that we're doing.
Today i thought we were giving away.
Hoodie i know you they go for my dick no.
That would hurt no why can't we all be.
Friends the world works the world's a.
Cold place full of dick shots in.
Half-court shots figures up oh my god.
It's terrifying dude they're stand.
Around kids i have something to tell you.
I came here today expecting to make you.
Guys a little happier and expecting.
Maybe to leave a little happier doing.
Something good for the world but you've.
Ruined my life and i've had a horrible.
Time and i want you all to know that the.
Duck he's gonna chase me.
Don't worry kenny goes faster than that.
You guys are the watts empowerment.
Centers right what do you guys do yeah.
So everything from after-school tutoring.
Music arts dance theater sports teams.
Everything this is one of the only.
Neutral zones and watch it this place is.
Kind of readathon you've never had we've.
Been here every week for 13 years.
Providing mentoring yeah haven't had one.
Person hurt in 13 years i think that's.
The most important question i was gonna.
Ask is like who are the kids or these.
Magical beings running around and.
Beating my ass.
This is watts after-school tutoring.
Music arts dance theater all the sports.
Scenes if we don't provide it it doesn't.
Exist but it's because the community.
They really run the center they protect.
It so when the average age here is 21.
And the largest age group is 10 or.
Younger.
So it's kids that are raising kids and.
The dropout rate at schools little over.
50% to less than 3% even make it to.
College and i'm like guys i love you but.
I got no money and they're like figure.
Something out what is the gangs that are.
Asking you to figure it out you guys.
Have incentive to try so this is.
Government housing so basically everyone.
Just lives here this is all they know.
And this is all most of them have ever.
Gone within a two mile radius.
Most of them have never been to the.
Ocean that they've never been to a.
Sporting event they've never been.
Outside a little circumference so it's.
Like you guys showing up like you're.
Bringing a little bit of the world to.
Them i think a big thing for us is like.
A dream right now what i want is i want.
Us to be able to build a recording.
Studio and a film studio for like i saw.
A couple of kids running around like.
Andre will give him the camera yeah i.
Was like yo what are these kids like cuz.
Andre given cameras like you all want to.
Be ographers.
Hey we're just hustling for the hood out.
Here so like honestly if there's any way.
You can help us hustle for these kids.
Because they deserve the best and they.
Aren't second-class citizens and i'm.
Tired of them thinking.
Why did you do this and they've changed.
My life honestly it's just i don't know.
I came just because one of my friends.
Was hanging out here one day and i.
Wanted to see him but 13 years later.
Every week i'm still showing up for some.
Reason and they understand that the.
Future is bright but it's not because of.
Some system that's in place but because.
They're going to write history.
I've never done anything like this in la.
Or ever in my life.
And i like i really do like kids and.
Like being here makes me like realize.
That i think i definitely come by it.
More often or however i could help go.
Sailing i want to get behind something.
Man and i really appreciate you guys i.
Really appreciate you guys allowing me.
To come in and.
Music.
It means a lot because lots of people.
They talk a big game and they'll apply.
To africa but they won't even come to.
The other side of town thank you for.
Actually caring about this side thank.
You i think it might be it's not a dream.
Confirmed wow you are quick you are a.
Quick young man wow i'm actually.
Impressed by wow i said it to you back.
There.
You cried why i don't know i got had a.
Moment bro what was it i don't know if i.
Haven't had to tear my eye probably like.
15 years dude you're lying.
Ah cuz the girl said that there were.
People that said i like people calm here.
Like for one-time visits and they sit.
Tell the kids that they're coming back.
And no one ever comes back and it like.
Made me so sad we should do our best to.
Not be one of those no we are we got to.
Go back bro and like as i wasn't lying.
When i talked to that guy as much as i.
Did get hit in the dick like i enjoyed.
Myself too that was a lot of fun i felt.
Like i was finally around people my age.
Yeah you looked like it dude you're in.
Your full element those kids have so.
Much energy and there's so many of them.
Which is actually also like kind of sad.
So many kids i mean i've never done.
Anything like that in my life and i feel.
Like it really puts it in the.
Perspective how much different someone.
Else's quality of life can be i'm.
Incredibly fortunate and thankful for.
What i've been blessed with with but if.
I can help them do whatever it is they.
Want to do achieve the goals they want.
To achieve by inspiring them motivating.
Them whatever it is i really i really.
Want to do that and i made a point to.
The guy i said i don't want to be one of.
Those people that says he's gonna come.
Back to the dissenter and not come back.
To just abandon the kids forever i.
Really did have a good time with them.
Today even though i can't feel my penis.

Look to develop further further.
