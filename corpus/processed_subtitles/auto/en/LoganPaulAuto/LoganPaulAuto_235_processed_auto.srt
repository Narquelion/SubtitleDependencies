Thirty thousand maverick pandemic masks.
Gone in three hours first off thank you.
Guys it seems like you guys are really.
Digging the new design the second off.
It's cool that we actually provided.
Something good like these will help you.
And give you that extra layer of.
Protection that you might need there's a.
Lot of people working really hard to.
Restock these so we do have more and.
We're saving some for the first.
Responders here in la nurses doctors.
Police officers firefighters etc who.
Keep checking the site it's mad for.

About to get even better it's not cook.
Bay i'm getting a new bird you guys know.
About the tragedy that was maverick the.
Parrot on my    evil evil tibetan.
Mastiff ginger the giant ate him now his.
Legacy is preserved in cloth it's.
Actually kind of sad i am a bird guy.
Like i'm ag admit it i'm a dork bird guy.
Is equivalent to cat lady like it's.
Weird i'm not proud of it i.
Don't know why i just like bird so for.
The past two months i've been looking.
For this breed of bird i think is this.
Coolest    bird ever it's called the.
African grey they're so smart they have.
The intellect of like a five-year-old.
And they could say up to a thousand.
Words i couldn't find one so finally i.
Took the social media you guys may have.
Seen in my instagram i was asking like.
Does anyone know someone with an african.
Grey one of my friends reached out.
Pointed me in the direction of this.
Family who had an african grey and it.
Needed a home so i figured who better to.
Adopt him than the owen one youtubing.
Boxer he's about to be here i'm really.
Nervous but also excited so let's do.
This he's so beautiful.
Music.
Hi buddy.
What's up logan nice to meet you yeah i.
Feel that oh my god i'm already doing.
The thing oh my god bro there's gonna be.
A moment where he says his first word i.
Love it i love him so much.
Oh this is so weird and oddly kind of.
Uncomfortable but i guess if this is how.
You do it that's how you doing he's like.
Deep throating this syringe is actually.
Kind of horrifying lana wrote scene am i.
Right i'm just kidding come on guys it's.
A job so that's it the new member of the.
Family holies.
Music.
My heart is melting right now good boy.
Yes of general rule of thumb if you see.
This dog who is also that dog just stay.
Away from her got this weird thing which.
She like eats parrots no no stay away.
From her to think that if things go.
Right and he stays away from that dog.
Will be boys for fifty years 50 years.
That's half of mike's age i'ma be honest.
With you bro you better start getting.
Used to me in my pale thighs tommy it.
Was like everything else in my life my.
Bird is    on me welcome to the.
Family.
Sweet so sweet crazy right well this.
Birds doe probably it has a bright.
Feathers i'm like actually gusto it's.
Like when your dad approves your.
Girlfriend so we put his cage in this.
Corner and we actually kind of like the.
Location of it so i think we're gonna.
Try to find a custom cage build or to do.
Like a curved one right here that way.
He'll be around people he'll be social.
And everyone could see him from the.
Kitchen someone's jealous he's never.
Given me this much attention oh why are.
You so jealous bro this bird can eat his.
Own ass i've been trying to do it for.
Years that's cool as you can see this.
Bird is extremely uncoordinated he looks.
Like me attempting to run in the.
Challenger games i have never seen an.
Animal this uncoordinated but it's cause.
He's still a baby we're gonna work on it.
We have a lot of life training to do.
Music.
It's our first morning together are you.
Kidding me is he perfect or my tripping.
We're having pillow talk and everything.
Well be honest he's a better color than.
Most of the girls i thought homie for.
Life he's been kind of jumping around on.
The bed testing his wings a little bit.
Think if he keeps on doing this.
Eventually he'll be able to learn how to.
Fly look somehow this bird has become.
What i like to call the instant homey.
It's funny cuz with maverick you know.
When i talked when we put subtitles but.
Since this bird will legitimately be.
Able to speak english i don't think.
We'll need subtitles here's what i'm.
Teaching him to say    i love.
You was bob yeah does it look like a.
Flying am i about to take off.
Hahaha they told me his wings were.
Clipped i think it's like half true he's.
Been flying around the house he's ran to.
The fridge a couple times i think cuz.
He's a baby he's been sleeping a lot.
It's kind of funny i don't know if you.
Noticed about birds or not but when they.
Sleep they tuck one leg up and somehow.
Balance on the other but they also put.
Their head like on their back so if you.
Look from the front they can look like.
They've been decapitated but don't worry.
He still has a head i think oh my god he.
Almost went in the fish tank holy sh.
Look at the fish broke they're animals.
They're like a lion pack just waiting to.
Eat the near spirit period with the word.
Dysfunctional he's stuck dude if it's.
Good look at him this is the dumbest.
Never.
Music.
Now after spending a few days with my.
New son it was time to give him a name a.
Name that would make a statement a name.
Worthy of carrying on the legacy of.
Maverick the parent a name so epic that.
It causes tremors in the earth every.
Time it's uttered and i finally got it.
Ladies and gentlemen introducing sir.
That's right his name is sir the african.
Grey hooking it above on instagram at.
Sir the grey or don't i don't really.
Care this loves oversubscribed by where.
He says his first word.
