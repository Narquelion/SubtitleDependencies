Everything as a group we sat down we.
Thought to ourselves what is the one.

Thought humanly possible for him to.
Possibly possess as a human in this.

He became the butt of the joke welcome.
To la home of the fake tits and real.

The pressure of like gift giving and.
Receiving it just gives me so much.
Anxiety like for two months for all mike.

Different person because of the gifts i.
Asked you for your birthday you might.
Cry like these are like to kind of guess.
They're gonna make you like well i'm a.
Little bit beyond us with you bro i.
Don't really care about that shrimp is.
Dealing why it's not a really a mantis.
Shrimp dude like it's it's a part of the.
Reason i i think i'm obsessed with the.
Mantis shrimp is because i'm colorblind.
And the real mantis shrimp is so vibrant.
It's kind of just like a monochrome like.
Shrimp on over.
