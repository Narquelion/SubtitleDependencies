14 years old.
Freshman year basically consistent of.
Getting beaten up popping pimples.
Getting beaten up trying to fit in.
Begging not to get beat up and getting.
Beaten up more let's just say this was.
Not my year i could compare it to a 2018.
Logan paul anyways i had not hit puberty.
Yet i was the shortest one out of all my.
Friends my voice was still high and my.
Dick was still small fabulous but still.
I remember freshmen logan was so.
Intrigued by some of the senior girls.
They were so hot how did they have so.
Many curves and womanly features it.
Didn't make any sense.
Well the hottest one her name was sarah.
Campbell let's call her she happened to.
Be in my study hall this girl was a dime.
When she walked by us it was fireworks.
Baby the booty the boobies the beauty.
Sitting behind her for half the year was.
One of the greatest experiences of my.
Life.
One day after getting beaten up i.
Decided i was done looking at the back.
Of sarah campbell's head for 45 minutes.
Every day i was gonna march right up to.
Her and make her my wife while i still.
Had the chance.
So i give my battle call hannah and i.
Say okay look i literally don't know.
What's yours i take your bread meanwhile.
I'm sweating bullets i'm a rock hard for.
Some reason and i feel like my lungs are.
About to explode oh thanks but are you.
Okay she must have noticed that i wasn't.
Breathing on the floor well my tactics.
Work and she must have thought me being.
Unconscious was cute because from that.
Day on sometimes sarah would initiate.
Conversations with me and i even helped.
Her.
Homework once but i knew that our.
Relationship had to go to that next.
Level and to do that i needed her phone.
Number so i asked my freshman friends.
For advice and lucky for me my one.
Friend jamie was actually family friends.
With sara and he had her number so i.
Took it from him because i did not feel.
Like passing out again in front of sara.
Not my brand.
That night moment of truth phones out.
Fingers ready to texts ears so.
Good she marries me on the spot tomorrow.
So i go hit send and then i wait ding.
Hey what's up oh but of course i play it.
Cool damn i was killing it these types.
Of riveting conversations went on for.
About two weeks straight of course the.
School i'm bragging to my boys talking.
About how smooth i am none of them.
Believe me so i show them the text and.
She's sending like pictures of things.
She even told me what part of town she.
Lived in and what her favorite movie was.
All of us were losing our minds finally.
One day sara and i were texting and she.
Asked me for advice on what to wear to a.
Nice family dinner a dress all right.
Scary huh i don't know i like dresses.
Not me though not like for me like not.
For personal reasons like i like dresses.
On girls sometimes good you as you can.
See i was still pretty nervous as.
About this girl but then she hits me.
With the text that would change my life.
Forever hey can i send you a picture of.
Me in the dress darn what the    did i.
Just read that right can i send you a.
Picture of me in the dress oh my god i.
Knew at that moment i was in she wanted.
These virgin lifts and it was undeniable.
You don't just send someone a picture of.
You in a dress unless you finished smash.
And that's just facts so i respond all.
Cool is    yeah why ii completely.
Dropped the a in the h to show.
Confidence so i wait and again i'm rock.
Hard i do not know why but five minutes.
Go by 10 minutes go by 30 minutes go by.
It felt like i had lived five lifetimes.
And then.
Incoming picture message from sarah.
Campbell my hands are shaking.
I opened the message and oh my gosh what.
The    was i looking at that first is.
Looking to chuck or maybe a pokemon.
Potentially that pokemon that looks like.
A duck side but no after further.
Inspection i realize i'm looking at an.
Extreme close-up of a man's face and.
Then it hits me that man is jamie my.
Friend jamie the one who gave me sarah's.
Number in the first place except now.
It's very clear to me it wasn't sarah's.
Number i had been flirting with my.
Friend jamie over text for the past two.
Weeks and sure i'm embarrassed but what.
About jamie who keeps a joke up for this.
Long what the    man you got some real.
Life identity problems next day at.
School.
Jamie the boys are all making fun of me.
Poor thing laughing all making the duck.
Faces he see sarah and study hall but i.
Can't tell her what happened or show her.
My face forever.
My heart was shattered and their dignity.
Was gone so i did what any heartbroken.
Post catfish freshman would do nothing.
Except go get beat up again the end.
