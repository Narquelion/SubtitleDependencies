Did together i saw justin bieber walked.
Out with you did you think he wrote the.
Song one less lonely girl about you or.

Huge strides for boxing as well brought.
A ton of new eyes to it and took it.
Seriously like we gave the the sport the.
Respect that it deserved see we put on a.
Sick show like that that was it's.

Win like i like yeah i lost i lost the.
Fight wink face and quite possibly one.
Of my favorite moments of the night and.
I said this in my win speech i i don't.
Like being a dick i'd like i'd do the.
Press conferences and i turn into this.
Like witty    to put on a go to a.
Good show and entertain you guys i don't.
Like beef or drama and at the end of the.
Day ksi and i we made up we shook hands.
In the ring and we settled it you know.
It's weird how it took bashing each.
Other's skulls in to do that but we did.
It yeah that was a sick moment for the.
First time in my life when the announcer.
Told jay jay he's like oh is the beef.
Settled then and i remember just looking.
At him like you look at a girl when you.
Ask her on a date and you're like.
Waiting for the answer and i was just so.
Excited when like we'd apt up and and.
Squashed it and then also bieber came to.
The event like wiz khalifa rick wob'.
Rick ross dan bilzerian like you guys.
Gotta understand i am at the end of the.
Day like call the followers not you guys.
Like i love you guys like the number.
Like the fact that i have a following.
That all this like stuff i have money.
Friends girls like all that i'm a kid.
From a town in ohio who planned on being.
An engineer for the rest of his life and.
I thought that until i was 19 years old.
I'm 24 all this has happened in five.
Years of my life like a small-town kid.
Like like frogger almost like i'm like.
Jumping through traffic.
I just keep making it to the next level.
And next level and so this is so surreal.
For me all of this is so surreal for me.
And like bieber came into the locker.
Room beforehand he said a prayer with us.
And then he walked me out one of the.
Coolest things ever and his public.
Support for me is like that means the.
World the fact that he's able to to put.
His neck out there for me and like just.
Keep supporting me no matter what he.
Posted me on his instagram tour twice.
Now which is crazy bieber i    love.
You bro i changed my bio it's just as.
Belieber now and it's because i believe.
I believe dude like how is any of this a.
Loss like what cuz i didn't get my hand.
Raised yeah yeah okay here's the new.
Think a new rule i'm making it right now.
Winning is for losers and losing is for.
Winners you think people would buy that.
But yeah nah i just don't feel like a.
Loser there's a lot of content i want to.
Do around the fight like a proper.
Breakdown behind the scenes stuff that.
Happened it was quite the day like this.
This whole training camp has been.
Absolutely crazy like i said this before.
And i know it's been memed but i woke up.
Sick that day and if i'm being honest.
Completely destroyed my morale trust i.
Do not want to be the guy that's making.
Excuses but i'm gonna make excuses if.
You guys saw the fight the whole two.
Points thing was one of them and okay.
This is that kind of delicate and a bit.
Sensitive so i didn't like prepare.
Anything like i do for normal videos i.
Normally have like beats to hit so i'm.
Just gonna speak from the heart i asked.
My videographer andre to leave the room.
Because i don't know where this is gonna.
Go but you know i've been saying i i.
Don't i don't feel like i lost because i.
Really don't like i'm i'm smiling i'm.
Not like depressed i don't feel like my.
Career is over like which was the big.
Threat or like i was made into a meme.
The only mean that happened was because.
I said it sneeze three times so like i'm.
Going out i'm enjoying my life again and.
Every day i get passed by people i get.
Phone calls i get taxed tagged in some.
Video online that that says like y'all.
Logan you didn't you didn't lose that.
Fight that was    the ref made an.
Erroneous call or it was like and.
Misinterpreted by the judges i thought.
You won the fight.
The fight whatever just like a slew of.
Extremely one-sided opinions about the.
Outcome of the fight being 100% honest.
With you i have not heard or seen one.
Comment not even from ksi side or like.
The british fans that have said the two.
Points was the right call and to give.
You guys some context as to why this is.
Such a big deal i'm gonna try not to get.
Like too technical with boxing scores.
But we might have to so bear with me the.
Fight was a split decision the two.
Points that were deducted from me in.
Round four let's say he let me off with.
A warning by the way i think he should.
Have done because he had not given me.
Any prior warnings to prior to that if.
That had happened i would have won the.
Fight it would have been a split.
Decision with two judge's ruling it in.
My favor now let's say the ref deducted.
Only one point for the tap in the back.
Of the head on jay jay it would have.
Been a majority draw but the two-point.
Deduction was the reason that i full-out.
Split decision lost the fight to the.
Winner by split decision from the united.
Kingdom.
This is tricky for me because i my.
Initial reaction was and i sat with this.
For a little bit my initial reaction was.
To fight it and and contest it and you.
Know try my hardest to make this right.
But i decided to let it go and give jj.
The benefit of the doubt kind of go.
Hands-off give the man his his win like.
He deserved it.
So fighter he's a    warrior a true.
Animal and so i posted on instagram.
Publicly i'm like yo congrats to the.
Champ and so i took the back seat and i.
Was gonna let life work itself out and.
Then i'm just getting bombarded.
Thousands of people fans boxing fanatics.
Friends random people on the street i'm.
Driving by me in cars or it's the.
Restaurant that i'm at telling me that.
The outcome of the fight just wasn't.
Right i did some research and the last.
Time two points were taken away from a.
Professional fight was like over a.
Decade ago doesn't happen a lot one of.
The times that it happened was when mike.
Tyson bit evander holyfield's ear off.
And spit it on the floor which is one of.
The nastiest thing that's things that's.
Ever happened in boxing and here i am.
Getting two points deducted from me for.
Like a like a like a love tap in that i.
Was like a heat-of-the-moment just like.
A pissed off i'm in fight mode it's one.
Of those situations where the punishment.
Just simply did not fit the crime this.
Is pretty funny this is a still of the.
Rough deducting two points and i'm.
Standing there and i know this is like.
Probably ruin the fight for me it is my.
First professional debut to be honest.
With you i have no like real ideal what.
I'm doing and it's a six round fight you.
Know how hard it is to earn back two.
Points in a six round fight.
Assuming no one's gonna get knocked out.
Or knocked down it just put me at the.
Bottom of a mountain that when i looked.
Up i wasn't sure i could overcome it and.
Horrific ly i was right and jack reese.
Who is the ref is apparently like one of.
The best the california state athletic.
Commission has and one of the best.
Boxing reps so i don't want to like i.
Don't want to dog the guy and i don't.
Want.
I don't want you all to blow up his spot.
He even said it in the locker room after.
I spoke to him at length he said if he.
If he if he's made a mistake he's down.
To correct it and that's i wanted you.
Guys to hear this from me first my team.
And i have decided to file an official.
Appeal for for the fight because we just.
Don't believe that the outcome was right.
And that that is it strikes me resonates.
With me to my core and one of my biggest.
Fears with this whole thing is being a.
Sore loser and that's why i'm making.
This video a week after the fight is.
Because i really had to check myself and.
Make sure i wasn't doing this because i.
Was afraid of losing and historically.
We've seen guys like i've taken big l's.
Massive elves by no means am i afraid of.
Losing i've in fact i welcome it because.
It's the only way i tend to experience.
Growth in my life but i truthfully 100%.
Believe i did not lose this fight if i.
Am harassed and belittled for speaking.
My mind or speaking out about something.
That i think is right like again god.
Strike me down for doing this horrible.
Thing but i have to ask myself often in.
My life because like i i've reached this.
Weird point where i like you too.
Nonchalant about things sometimes like i.
Just like don't give up to be honest and.
At first i was definitely like this and.
Then my stomach just started turning.
Over the fact that like i don't believe.
The outcome was correct on this and i.
Think if i stood by and didn't do.
Anything about it or at least i cry i'd.
Be i'd be way disappointed with myself.
I'm making this video for two reasons.
One to man up and say i'm doing it.
Versus standing by and you guys finding.
Out via twitter and it becoming some.
Sort of meme like logan paul's a sore.
Loser like i'll tell you right now like.
I just don't think i lost and i would.
Like for the outcome of this fight to be.
Dictated the way it should be and then.
Be this is a just a a plea to the.
California state athletic commission i i.
Would just hope that you guys give this.
The weight that i think it deserves.
Because i fear that since we aren't real.
Professional fighters it may be.
Overlooked but i know this means a lot.
To me i know this means a lot to my team.
My fur.
Most importantly my fans and the fans.
That watched the great sport of boxing.
In the event that we put on on saturday.
Andy foster i'm talking to you man i.
Know you're a good guy and if even if.
The outcome does not come back in my.
Favor please treat it as a normal boxing.
Appeal to be completely transparent with.
You guys i have gone back and forth on.
This video for this whole week i've been.
Losing sleep over this it's tough.
Because like i don't.
Again i don't mind losing especially to.
Jay jay like that is a worthy adversary.
That dude is of is a g he's an animal.
And like i said in my tweet like i.
Cannot wait to see what he does next i.
Wish him only the greatest success but.
If i don't stand up for something that i.
Feel is right what kind of can man am i.
That is not the type of man i want to be.
It's not the type of leader i want to be.
That's not the type of father i want to.
Be so yeah i'ma fight for for what i.
Believe in again i think i think i said.
Everything like i said this video is.
Delicate and it is just super.
Unfortunate a split decision and we're.
Back here with this with this.
Controversial wind that jay jay had i.
Said i was done with controversy and all.
The headlines are like open paul.
Controversial split decision loss like.
Why can i just not avoid some sort of.
Controversy ah life dude this is a weird.
One for me it is tricky this is tricky.
Regardless we put on a    good show.
You saw the beginning of the video like.
You know i'll be alright i'll be back in.
The boxing ring boxing it's where i'll.
Be in the ring pocket all right dude we.
Passed 20 million subscribers that's.
Dope but if you're not subscribed.
Subscribe and i'll be doing a proper.
Boxing breakdown review later and maybe.
A mini doc about the day the whole day.
Leading up to the fight cuz it well i.
Mean it is it was horrible but we'll.
Talk more about that later all right.
Um i think that's it i probably just.
Stay here until i decide to stop the.
Camera from the.
Okay.
