There was really nothing to do in ohio.
We were always like bored and kind of.
Like trying to find like fun little.
Things to do we kind of just made do.
With with like whatever we could.
I remember them just fooling around with.
The camera i didn't really think a whole.
Lot about it so let me start i just want.
To ask what is this documentary the.
Backlash against the social media star.
Who posted video of an apparent suicide.
Victim is intensifying viewed over 6.
Million times in just 24 hours people.
And creators of all sizes denouncing.
Logan paul and this video but he insists.
That he only did it to raise awareness.
About suicide prevention he starts.
Laughing and his friend starts me.
You said before this fight you have.
Something planned lads got this bout.
Right now come get it.
No get born.
So i'm ready.
Wanted into second.
Is is you know just like ask directly.
Is this a fluff piece to make people.
Feel better about logan fall.
Music.
