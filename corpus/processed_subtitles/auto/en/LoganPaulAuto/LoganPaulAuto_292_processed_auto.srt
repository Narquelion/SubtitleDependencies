In the 2019 challenger games thank you.
Guys for joining us for a very special.
Event this has been the challenger games.
2019 we'll see you next time.
That a mad star yet a rough race.
Whenever i start in a plastic chair for.
Four half hours have a drink of water.
Nothing i was treated like somebody i.
Was fasting and some sort of hindu.
Ritual here we are rebecca so the.
Problem was i shouldn't have ran on it.
At all but my pride and my ego a little.
Bit was sort of affected and i was.
Embarrassed and i wanted to at least.
Complete the race and so i did i ran.
Sort of the hundred meter dash and.
Phousi actually carried me i'm sure you.
Guys saw across the finish line which.
Was awesome but i think the real problem.
Was me trying to run the relay with.
Summer charlie and jake and hopping down.
100 meters just like hold and reap old.
And reap old and then next thing you.
Know slowly but surely turning into.
Thanos but everyone got hurt at the i.
Made a list here the challenger games.
Literally just collected hamstrung king.
Batsh a sensei charlie morally model roz.
A sensor daisy key joseline and austin.
Mcbroom everyone in some way or shape or.
Form got hurt related to the challenger.
Getting one of the hundred meter mens he.
Three people in this same race got hurt.
Like just ridiculous we're all right.
We're getting tools for this next year i.
Don't think the challenger games are.
Gonna be a track-and-field me it's gonna.
Be a different type of epic event so.
Comment below what you want to see think.
Like maybe american ninja warrior think.
Like gladiator type war a nice friendly.
Harmless game of golf with that said.
