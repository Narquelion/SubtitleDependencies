An evil okay this is actually impeccably.
Tweeted uh august 25th would be the day.

Bro got my tentacles spread out in a lot.
Of industries third of all bro if.
Anyone's gonna end my career.

Did it once twice not anymore.
Anyways guys it's time to go pick up the.
Big yeti oh she's my baby i'm missin'.
Earth's the moment you've been waiting.
For an actually speaking of it's a.
Little yeti right there was good a part.
Back you see into the alleyway ivan just.
Took a spin and in his yeti i can see.
Everything i didn't think that was that.
Steep alright and go two miles an hour i.
Thought i could get it i went up on the.
Ramp.
Okay this is great fun the mini is.
Absolutely amazing but it is time we.
Gonna pick up the visual.
Music.
Just be careful now heaven wouldn't want.
Your crash in this car to go up a hill.
Then flip this car i'ma sit here in.
These car rides i'm thinking too.
Literally the only thing that's bad.
About this maverick much time to do it.
Different shirts you can't see cuz it's.
On the bottom what do you we have tilted.
Over backwards probably not yeah just a.
Foot flip i must have missed that.
Music.
Hey evan do you think i could try mm-hmm.
Hey spence read the title card for.
Always it's a dry me whenever i drive.
You to spins.
Music.
Oh hey there guys i don't think this.
Would be a logan paul vlog if something.
Didn't go wrong yeah yeah the audio cut.
Out in the car so here's a voiceover but.
It's not that big nothing really amazing.
Happens here except oh my god what is.
That oh it's my baby the yeti okay this.
Is me reacting to seeing the yeti for.
The first time in forever that's just.
Like when you break up with a girlfriend.
And you meet up to have makeup sex.
That's how i'm feeling right now anyways.
Guys it turns out that the tires were.
Literally almost bigger than evan this.
Guy a victor he told me that my g wagen.
What's the only g wagen with tires this.
Big in the world 40 inch tires.
Oh man not to mention the ladder on the.
Back evan climbed up on top of the roof.
Rack which we also now have and even.
Came with an axe and a shovel for.
Whatever reason you're gonna use a.
Shovel for but anyways this cool also.
Has these these wires these cables on.
The front of the vehicle for extreme.
Effort actually have no idea what.
They're for but i could talk about how.
Cool this is all day but i just think.
It's better if we doin a bit more job.
Music.
Music.
Music.
It's like spinning a wall right now road.
No it's just showing nothing and.
Combined with the little voiceover mic.
Issue we had that we literally just.
Found out about that because we went.
Back and look at the footage and you can.
Hear i leave it over here this one out.
Well we got good news oh it's that way.
All right that driveway and climb up in.
There i think we can find it bug sick.
All right so who wants to do the.
Trespassing me are you ah okay so you.
Got a lock on that signal but we're.
Closed i think if you stick your ass out.
A little bit more it'll elongate the.
Signal i know just clearly until we're.
In jurassic park.
Baby what's that when t-nuts saw these.
Music.
Do you think that has something to do.
With the problem you like that would.
Affect like probably we got the footage.
Though let's go got it do it dude.
Perfect trail we gotta get the yeah guys.
I want to you know talk about the title.
Of the vlog and everything i want to get.
The yeti up here doing a cool spot.
There's just one problem i'm seeing.
Spencer you see it down there.
All right you referencing that huge pile.
Of dirt yeah put in the divot find it's.
A big old pile of dirt here the divots.
Right here and i definitely see how it.
Could be a problem to get over we're.
Forgetting something specific follow me.
Here cuz i got a shovel i was like i'm.
Never actually gonna use it it's been 30.
Minutes.
Like they put dirt here so people.
Wouldn't do this most vehicles don't.
Have a shovel included with them there.
You go keep going i think you're about.
Two and a half percent there i think.
That's good.
Nothing to it but to do it there's a.
High chance that the same thing that.
Happened to evan in his mini yeti today.
Could happen to me right now i.
Definitely don't want that that's a.
Steep hill bro chances are this could.
Work i don't 90 69 percent something.
Like that you.
Music.
Okay pro hockey.
Music.
So top-heavy on this thing yeah go slow.
Hey.
You need more speed.
I know my baby could do it.
Whoa.
Oh yeah.
Let's go.
Music.
The view right now is absolutely.
Breathtaking.
If we overcame that little hill pushed.
Ourselves a little bit oh forgetting the.
Challenge we would be gifted with the.
Universe with doll that oh baby look.
Around.
Golden our goals and our bro life is.
Beautiful right now.
Music.

Movement in the form of maverick i joke.
And i and i make jokes about looking.
Bald like i was shot but i attribute.
Most of my success a lot of my success.
To not only working hard to not only get.
Up over the hill but to do it different.
To look at a situation and be like ok i.

Little spice on it a little salt bay to.

Passion so basically where i'm going.
