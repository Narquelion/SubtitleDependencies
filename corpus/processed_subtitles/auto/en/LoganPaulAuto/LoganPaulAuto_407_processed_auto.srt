Your boy is undefeated i also have zero.
Wins that's right oh oh and one oh and.
Water what is that a draw was a draw oh.
My gosh ah i hate that so much i hate it.
So much when they raised our hands you.
Can see by my face my mouth dropped i'm.
I was absolutely stunned ksi has the.
Exact same reaction on the other side.
It's weird because you don't know.
Whether to celebrate or be disappointed.
Like you didn't win but you didn't lose.
And after talking to you guys in public.
At the airport's the general consensus.
Seems to be if you wanted ksi to win you.
Think he won and if you wanted me to win.
You think i want it's it's split i.
Personally think i won and i'm gonna be.
Doing a fool round by round analysis in.
The upcoming weeks so guys if you're not.

Calm slash shop or a link in description.
Now finally i'm going to dive into this.
Video let's talk about something i would.
Like to skiing address some people are.
Saying the fight was raped or that it.
Was staged or that it was faked from the.
Bottom of my heart literally suck my ass.
Jj and i put our hearts on the line.
Everything we had we were warriors out.
There beating the    out of each other.
We all worked so hard so and for anyone.
To say that was fake also another thing.
In addition to that last one oh god made.
New you the doll about the fight so rick.
I've read articles that have said ksi.
And i have walked away with 30 to 40.
Million dollars each i cannot stress how.
False that is and how each one of the.
Fighters involved was absolutely not.
Doing it for the money.
Let me explain i might make an entire.
Video on this if my team lets me but.
Between all the expenses on god i am not.
Just saying this for the internet i am.
Not a hundred percent sure i came out.
Positive.
On this event that means i'm not sure if.
I made money on the event think about it.
There is no this isn't like an official.
Boxing league the pay-per-view unlike.
Boxing pay-per-view events and ufc.
Pay-per-view events was not $100 right.
It was $10 there was no official major.
Big sponsor there's no al heyman checks.
Coming in this is a couple youtubers.
Doing this four year entertainment who.
Are yes trying to make money i think we.
Severely miscalculated the expenses.
Examples including 30% of the revenue.
Goes to youtube right away then i split.
The remainder with team ksi then i split.
That with jake accordingly then out of.
That another 30% goes to my managers.
Lawyers agents everyone involved from my.
Team we paid for venues our full-time.
Boxing coach we flew like 30 to 40.
People out to manchester and provided.
Them with lodging for like two weeks i.
Could go on and on and on and like i.
Said i might make a full entire video.
About this in the future if you guys.
Want to see it so yeah again subscribe.
And let me know in the comments below.
But okay as far as the fight goes let's.
Talk about the fight oh oh man my first.
Ever amateur boxing fight with really.
Only four months of training under my.
Belt good i want to say i was pretending.
To be a boxer cause like i had the.
Fundamentals down but people you know.
They worked their whole lives to be good.
At this one thing good to be good at.
This sport and i was going in there.
Right as a youtuber first not a fighter.
Or not a boxer and no one told me how.
Different it is from sparring in a gym.
To competing inside a ring in an actual.
Fight with 20,000 people watching and.
Millions on the internet night and ski.
Day and i am pretty sure that's why i.
Gassed out in the later round but i will.
Say after leaving the ring that night i.
Finally now feel like a fighter i.
Finally feel comfortable saying i am a.
Boxer and the sport is so fun dude like.
Just two dudes seeing the shot of each.
Other it's a beautiful thing that.
Experience is valuable but i did walk.
Out of the ring that night finally.
Feeling like a boxer and if if i got.
That good after only four months of.
Training i cannot imagine how good i'm.
Gonna be by the time i fight ksi.
Or whoever i fight next now with that.
Said i thought i won the fight i thought.
I won 4-2 i thought i won rounds 1 2 3 &.
5 ksi hands down took the fourth round.
And obviously the 6th round where he'd.
Just he    me up back in a line that.
Was me just trying to stay alive i was.
Completely out of gas and i was a little.
Disappointed that his cheap shots his.
Throwdowns his fouls like you guys.
Remember when he hit me after the bell.
Dog thing to do man like that was just.
Shady fighting ksi is like fighting a.
Dog dude became animalistic not a boxer.
After the first two rounds something his.
Coach must have said stuck in his mind.
Because he turned it on but he was just.
Throwing haymakers from down here none.
Of them were like legit boxing punches.
And you guys can imagine when i spar i'm.
Sparring professionals not dudes who are.
Head down just swinging for the fences.
So again first boxing match on my part.
Great you can get away with the sloppy.
Bulls but for the second match i promise.
Not a single one of those is going to.
Land so yeah i think he was able to get.
Away with the cheap shots because we.
Were in his country his hometown not.
Gonna be the same when he comes to.
United states in fact i'm not going to.
Leave it to the judges i just simply.
Won't and now that i know what i'm.
Missing.
And i know what i'm good at the.
Improvement is only gonna be there i.
Think you can sort of see can't sighs.
Demeanor after the fight and during the.
Fight there's like a underlayer of.
Disappointment i think it's because he.
Knows he missed his chance like that was.
It you had a chance to beat me and you.
Almost did if there were more rounds you.
Might have beaten me i'm not sure you.
Might have beaten me cuz i was.
Completely out of gas but there wasn't.
And it's over now like i'm only gonna.
Get exponentially better but regardless.
Again it was a phenomenal fight ksi mega.
Kudos to you dude you have the heart of.
A skiing warrior and i told you that.
After the fight both you and i know that.
Six round a bro you took me for a ride.
That round my goal was to just stay.
Alive which i did my issue at not issue.
But when i get hit and case i was.
Hitting me a lot that round with.
Lot of big strong fast powerful punches.
This happens in sparring - i don't.
Register it i don't mind getting hit in.
Fact i like it unless you knock me out.
Like i am not falling to the ground.
Which is good but at the same time.
There'd be times in sparring where my.
Coach is like yo what the    you doing.
Like we we have to stop because i'll be.
So tired my hands will be down and i'm.
Only using my face as as a weapon and.
It's not a weapon literally i'm just.
Getting hit in the face repeatedly i'm.
Sure i'll suffer brain damage later in.
My life for for doing these things.
That's part of it i guess but i gotta.
Say i think the warrior blood runs in.
Chaos eyes family cuz deji tangi you.
Impressed me bro you impressed everyone.
I don't think a single person thought.
You were gonna last five rounds bro good.
Job to you.
Hats off i think you proved a lot of.
People wrong that night including myself.
But of course brother jake came out with.
The victory i love jake it was so nice.
To see all of his hard work these past.
Couple months pay off and jake man it.
Must be nice having a belt like that and.
Having an official win you.
I'm just kidding kinda anyway the best.
Part about this event hands down was.
Afterwards the sportsmanship the fact.
That we four dudes are able to get in.
This little square and beat this of each.
Other and then shake hands and look each.
Other in the eye afterwards that was.
Invaluable.
Those were the special moments those are.
The moments that i'll never forget.
Cuz as much as i like fighting it's the.
Last resort always why would i ever want.
To do that i'm all about spreading love.
And positivity and happiness and the.
Fact that we were all able to squash the.
Beef one night right them right there.
Was incredible and then for me obviously.
This year has been obviously you guys.
Know like what it's been after the fight.
Jordy asked me a question and i was able.
To answer it in a way that i felt.
Encompassed and represented what this.
Fight was about for me.
Music.
Music.
That was definitely the most important.
Part of the fight for me just just so.
Many emotions and yeah crazy crap i.
Don't even know this is it's a crazy.
Life man 23 years old youtubing acting.
Singing writing producing rapping boxing.
Vlogger chat boy who knows what the list.
Will go on to say but overall um i don't.
Want to say i feel cheated or.
Disappointed i think the word is.
Slighted i feel slighted but that tells.
Me that i have to work that much harder.
The taste of not winning is absolutely.
Disgusting i promise the next time i set.
Foot in that ring i will be so scary.
Good i will be an actual boxer and i'm.
Not going to leave it up to the judges.
