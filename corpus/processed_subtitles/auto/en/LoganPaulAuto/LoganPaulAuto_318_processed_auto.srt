All my friends are much smarter than me.
We're working on the cygnus i look like.
A freaking mess right now hello gang.
Let's dive in for a second i do owe you.
Guys an explanation you guys are my.
Family you inspire me the reason i make.
Content is literally for you guys so i.
Felt like this needed to be said ha.
Vlogging a daily vlogging i did not vlog.
For the past two days because that was.
At coachella and in combination with me.
Being sick and having low energy like i.
Made a conscious decision to put every.
Ounce of energy i had into like dancing.
And just having fun in like my real life.
And you guys don't know this at.
Coachella you're not a lot of film.
Professionally and even though it is.
Just a couple of us running around like.
Idiots with the camera technically it is.
Like professional and again you guys.
Don't know this but we had this issue.
With burning man after the festival was.
Over we ran into some difficulties with.
Filming inside and whatnot even at your.
70 national park and we were there the.
Forest rangers they're like yo you you.
Cannot monetize any of these videos i.
Don't know if you guys noticed none of.
Them are monetized there were no ads in.
The u.s. 70 videos over my birthday.
Weekend which was fine but when it.
Basically when it comes to filming in a.
Large environment like coachella there.
Are so many things that i just didn't.
Feel like worrying about in combination.
With being sick in combination with the.
Fact that it's a music festival so every.
Time there's music playing in the.
Background which was all the time.
There's gonna be a copyright complaint.
And then the video would just be either.
Taken down or not monetized just the.
Storm of us and i did not really feel.
Like dealing with but the reason i bring.
This up is because i want to dive a.
Little deeper into the conversation.
Because it is it goes beyond just.
Coachella you guys know this i read your.
Comments whether it's me on a live.
Stream whether it's on twitter at logo.
Ball instagram alec and paul or just i'm.
The youtube channel and a lot of you.
Guys are commenting logan or uploading.
Today where's the daily vlog are you.
Even daily vlog anymore you've done in.
The past why how come you're making.
Excuses now i'm at the point where i've.
Vlog i've done i've done the daily.
Vlogging thing for literally 460 days in.
A row and it is fabulous but my goal and.
You guys know this i've said it before i.
Say it all the time with the vlogs is to.
Give you guys an escape from your daily.
Life just come to this channel and have.
Fun you get entertained you get ideas.
You get inspired whatever it is that's.
My job and me.
Personally i am uninspired when i feel.
Like i cannot do that.
To my full potential whether it's me.
Being sick whether it's me wanting to.
Allocate my time to branch out and do.
Other things guys i i know you don't.
Like to hear the sentence but i'm not.
Gonna be vlogging for the rest of the.
Mile i have so many other projects i'm.
Working on you guys know about him like.
We just built a $90,000 podcast set in.
My garage because we're gonna be doing.
Podcasts live podcast it's called.
Impulsive for you guys just as another.
Source of entertainment even this room.
This gaming room is something i just.
Wanted to branch out and try it just cuz.
Like i my goal is to be the biggest.
Entertainer in the world i don't want to.
Be locked down to one little thing.
Whether it's youtube daily vlogging.
Sketches on instagram making music we're.
Putting a studio i think the studio is.
Like two weeks out from being done in my.
Front guest house gaming building.
Businesses the maverick enterprise the.
Merge the oddest merged in the game.
Maverick my logan paul all of these.
Things combined i'm testing sort of i'm.
Dipping my toes in the water to find out.
Not only what i like as a 23 year old.
Human being what makes me happy on.
Planet earth but what you guys like.
Because as you know i didn't i didn't.
Get on youtube until like a year and a.
Half two years ago before that i did.
Vine they have to instagram than have to.
Facebook and then got on youtube i like.
Trying different things i want to do.
Everything like a full 360 degree circle.
Basically i'm rambling right now but.
Your guys's patience will unlock the.
Universe for us when it comes to content.
By logan paul most importantly guys.
Something i've realized even this past.
Week in the coachella this vlog as silly.
As it is is so much bigger than me and.
My team i had a fan come up to me at.
Coachella you know who you are you dog i.
Told you inspire me a person and i'm.
Saying it now i hope you're ok with it.
The low gang is gonna know so he had.
Lost someone very close to him they were.
Like this and he told me he was broke.
The only reason i got out of bed the.
Next morning was because i was looking.
Forward to watching your vlog and i.
Literally got goosebumps the person he.
Had lost was his father and mmin i'm.
Like probably even you you this is why i.
Made content you are the reason i'm.
Inspired to make vlogs so i take that.
And it just re-energizes me and is a.
Positive confirmation for me that i need.
Keep working on how i can use my.
Platform and our strength as a family on.
Youtube to make a positive impact on the.
World very soon i have been itching to.
Go like just just help people and maybe.
You guys can help me figure out what.
That cause is whatever attendant it.
Turns out to go to them whatever it.
Turns out to be look i don't know what.
It is okay and i know it's not cheesy.
But someone's got to do it the point is.
Low gang i freaking love you guys and.
Your patience with me is going to unlock.
