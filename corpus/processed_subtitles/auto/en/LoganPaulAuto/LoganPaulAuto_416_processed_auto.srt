Music.
Music.
All right a lot of cool stuff going on i.
Got something to say and not to get.
Cheesy but might get a little cheesy.
Guys i put out an instagram story the.
Other day explaining how i feel and.
Where i'm at in my life when it comes to.
Being a youtuber and an internet star i.
Don't love it i don't love this stigma.
That comes with being a youtuber when i.
Was on vine.
I was the vine guy right when i was on.
U2 or facebook it was like the facebook.
Star now i'm the controversial youtuber.
And not that i don't love youtube i.
Think being a creator on the platform is.
Absolutely amazing we are we are.
Extremely blessed as youtubers to be.
Able to build an audience on a platform.
That is incredibly dedicated to to be.
Able to create and do what we want.
Whatever we want but i just have this.
Deep desire to do more like i see people.
Doing stand-up comedy like i want to.
Dive into stand-up comedy i want to do.
Music i want to do acting writing.
Producing directing and i'm just not.
Sure if being a vlogger for the rest of.
My life will allow me to do those things.
I don't believe you can become the.
Biggest entertainer on the planet by.
Just being on youtube does that make.
Sense and and i'm 23 years old i.
Definitely don't want to fall into the.
Trap of instant gratification which.
Social media provide you make a vlog you.
Get views you get likes you get.
Subscribers and you get money and i.
Don't want to keep doing what i'm doing.
For those reasons i'm looking for a bit.
More of a creative fulfillment and like.
It's so funny because every vlogger i.
Feel like reaches this point and they.
All make this video i like i've seen.
Casey do it i've seen i think    do.
It it's me now god dammit i'm lost guys.
And i'm not hiding it i'm literally.
Capturing my instagram photo before like.
I'm long and i'm just looking for the.
Next step the next thing that i want to.
Do we did the flat earth documentary and.
As crazy and weird as that was i loved.
It i loved making films i love doing.
Long-form content so we're probably.
Gonna do more of that but i don't know.
What it comes down to is it is cheesy as.
It sounds at the end of the day i have.
To live what i've been preaching from.
Day one and that is do it different and.
Be a maverick and again i know it sounds.
Cheesy but it's true if i can embrace.
And not try to run away and go do.
Stand-up comedy or try to like be an.
Actor if i can embrace what youtube and.
The internet has blessed and given me.
With and innovate and make content in a.
Way that people haven't seen before.
Awesome different.
I think that's the key i think that's.
The key to the success and fulfillment.
As a creator that i am looking for logan.
In the past two and a half years we have.
Built one of the strongest families on.
Youtube it's not the strongest family on.
Youtube i don't want to let you guys.
Down you know when i see you in the.
Streets it's love baby i dig around i.
Treat you guys like friends your family.
Like i say it and yeah it's cheesy but.
We're family and i do not want to let.
You down so embrace and innovate that's.
That that's the conclusion i think we're.
Coming to hear with that said yo what a.
Fun trip this place is absolutely.
Beautiful live your life do something.
Crazy push the boundaries and be a.
System maverick low gang i love you guys.
And i'll see you next time.
Take it easy.
Music.
