Warmed up all right we have now seen the.
Ice swim so now it's your turn the fire.
Water how you feeling.
It's gonna be hot nina it was it was.
Mind over matter right.
Right all in here exactly so i think.
It's kind of a similar thing here with.
The with the fire right.
I mean i could burn but yeah mine over.
Here.
At this point i think the best way to do.
It from what i've heard is to put a.
Blindfold on that you don't actually see.
The fire and then cover your ears as.
Well for right now because kind of like.
Like sensory deprivation you basically.
Won't feel the flames if you can't see.
Them or hear them okay okay.
Seems legit right yeah yeah yep you pop.
The blindfold on okay.
Yep just like that and if you want to.
Cover your ears that way you won't be.
Able to hear anything.
All right yep so jacob keeps like.
Sensory deprivation come on come on come.
On come on.
Come on up here come on over here all.
Right so here's the game plan we've got.
A second board that's completely safe.
With no fire no flames no nothing it's.
Not hot at all so do not worry she will.
Not be stepping on anything hot but.
She's gonna think that jeans we're.
Pulling a crazy prank on her right now.
All right let's do the call actually.
You can take you can take the ears off.
Right now you uncover yours if you want.
To if you want to walk over here.
Oh my god it was hot right it looks oh.
That looks so hot on the count of three.
You can feel the heat.
Here we go so on the counter you're.
Gonna take your first step and remember.
If you feel uncomfortable any time you.
You can stop it if you make it all the.
Way down you've got a chance of a.
Thousand dollars you ready.
