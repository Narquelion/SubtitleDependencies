You and me.
Everything that we've been through has made us strong.
You won't believe.
We've had our grey.
But somewhere there's a light inside of us.
It shows the way.
Not looking for no, no, no heaven or gold.
'cause i got you, i got you.
Don't wanna show, show us off.
But you're my all, all that i need.
I'm telling you why.
This ain't no madness.
The smoke and the mirrors are memories now the sun has gone down.
Like a river rushing way up above.
This ain't, yeah this ain't.
No sugar coated love.
Yeah this ain't.
No sugar coated love.
This ain't, yeah this ain't.
No sugar coated love.
I stay in bed.
I still got the feeling that you're next to me.
Stuck in my head.
When lights go off.
You're everything that i could ever want.
Your touch so soft.
Not looking for no, no, no heaven or gold.
'cause i got you, i got you, i got you.
Don't wanna show, show us off.
But you're my all, all that i need.
I'm telling you why.
This ain't no madness.
The smoke and the mirrors are memories now the sun has gone down.
Like a river rushing way up above.
This ain't, yeah this ain't.
No sugar coated love.
Yeah this ain't.
No sugar coated love.
This ain't, yeah this ain't.
No sugar coated love.
Not tryina' sugarcoat but i'm flying so high.
I don't even know if i'm coming down.
You rock my boat when you hold me so tight.
The world just disappear in front of my eyes.
You and me.
Everything that we've been through has made us strong.
You won't believe.
