Crowd hi sisters.
James charles here and welcome back.
To my youtube channel.
As you guys can see i'm joined.
With quite a few sister special guests, the vlog squad.
Crowd woo hoo.
Oh my god you guys i am so beyond.
Excited for today's brand new video.
Because i feel like we've been trying to plan.
This for a long period of time.
I'm surprised you got all of us in here.
I know.
That's tough.
And jonah was almost on time.
He was earlier than all of you.
I know i just wanted to make him look bad.
So for today's video i have a very fun and fresh.
Make-up challenge planned that i just thought of a few.
Days ago and i was like wow,
I think this needs to happen.
And that is a new challenge that we're doing here called.
Make-up relay.
Crowd oh.
Thank you so much for all the special infatuation .
So basically you're all working together as a team.
But you don't really get to actually work together.
And you just have to hope that it all comes out good.
In the end.
So like you're only as strong as your weakest link.
Oof jonah.
Basically what we're going to do is we have nine of.
The vlog squad members here,
We're gonna put everybody's names in a hat.
And pick everybody at a random order,
And each person is going to have five minutes alone.
With me.
Crowd aah.
Jeff gets 10.
Jeff gets as much time as he needs.
I'm gonna lay out all the make-up products that i have.
In my everyday make-up routine,
And you all will have five minutes to do.
As much as you can.
Done.
Easy peasy baby.
Let's do it.
Five minutes that's nothing.
Everybody will rotate in and out while i ask everybody.
Questions about being in the vlogs.
And that's about it.
And also just glamming me up, but hopefully.
By the end of this we'll see if the vlog squad is able.
To work together,
To put a beautiful make-up look on me.
You're gonna look like a clown.
I actually want you guys to try really really hard.
To make it look good.
Uh huh.
How does everyone feel about their skill level.
When it comes to make-up.
I'm a solid seven and a half.
I'm a three and a half.
He's just really good at painting.
Okay.
I feel like out of the entire group i'm the worst at it.
Really.
Yeah, because jeff does like beauty stuff.
Did i tell you guys i'm the number one stylist.
On famous birthdays.
Holy shit.
You're so famous.
You said it like four times on the way over here.

Sorry i'm pushing really hard.
It's okay, how do you think you're gonna do with.
This make-up portion today.
Like, are you excited.
I think i'm gonna do good,
I feel like i would really shine in the like.
Color popping, getting around the eyes you know.
Okay.
But, i mean you know this is the.
Key starting point right here.
Ow.
What.
I think i just broke my toe.
I really think i just broke it.
Oh a little dabble here and there.
We don't wanna cake it on.
No.
We want a nice simple clean look.
Of course, of course.
So right here we're just gonna go around the brows.
Yeah.
Just tying that in, we don't wanna get to far in there.
But then kinda blot it,
You don't want it to smear.
Right, heath.
Yeah.
How long have you been in the vlog squad for.
Literally since the beginning, i was in.
David's first video.
Really.
Yeah.
So who was in the original, original.
Like who were the first ones.
It was like me, zane, alex.
So you're an og you've been there since day one.
Mhm.
We used to vine together and then all of a sudden he got.
This camera and was like i'm gonna start making.
Youtube videos and we were like oh wow.
He's like i don't know how long i'm gonna stick with it.
But i'm gonna try it out.
Yeah.
And then he just did it.
What's great is that we're all actual friends.
Yeah.
And we would stay friends, even if we weren't doing.
Social media which is really cool.
That's so good.
Even from being around you guys for a few minutes it's.
Very obvious that it's not just an act.
Yeah, i love my friend group, they're the best.
Go.
Very nice.
So you were telling me you watch all of those instagram.
Videos.
Yeah i just like scroll through like and not even on.
Purpose i don't look to find them but,
I'll just be going through and like one will pop up.
Then i'll get sucked into this world of like 30 minutes.
And like, wait, what.
The make-up videos on instagram are stone-age.
Yeah, i like seeing like a start and a finish.
Shit.
Speaking of finish.
Oh that's so good, okay well heath.
Your work here is done.
Thank you so much for your five minutes of time.
Oh my god, thank you.
Unfortunately we now have to move on to team member.
Number two and let's see where they start off.
Thank you for having me.
Thank you.
I can't wait to see the finished product.
See you in a little bit.
Number two has arrived.
Welcome sister.
Hi.
What do we think so far.
I don't know.
Okay.
I think he did your foundation,
Well he definitely did your foundation.
Okay, so analyze your canvas, this is what we have.
Going on so far.
You're about to start in the relay race.
Carly, we're putting five minutes on the clock.
Okay.
Are you ready to go.
Yeah.
Okay.
Me doing my make up every morning, five minutes.
Would love to relate, okay ready.
3,2,1 go.
Oh god bitch.
Okay, so he did your foundation i think i need to.
Do concealer after.
Okay great.
Is this true or are you not gonna tell me.
I can't tell you.
Oh, that's not concealer.
Where is it.
Oh, i've never seen something so beautiful in my life.
Okay, love that.
It is a too faced born this way we stan lady gaga,
I don't know if she made this, i would assume.
Yeah.
I don't even know if i'm doing this right.
So you and erin are kinda like a duo.
Yes.
So like how long have you guys know each other for.
And what brought you into the vlog squad.
We've known each other for like five or.
Six years probably.
Okay, cool.
And we started on vine.
Okay, love that.
So that's how we know everybody.
So everybody in the vlog squad started on vine.
Most of us, like.
I don't think jeff,
I don't know if jeff did,
I'm sure you wanna know all about jeff.
Yes i do.
Sister snatched, like this probably doesn't look good.
In real life but to me i'm killing it.
All that matters is that it looks good on camera.
I don't know i was really close with zane,
Like i'm so close with zane, he's probably my.
Best friend out of,
Like besides erin.
Is this, am i doing this right.
I can't tell you.
But does it feel right.
Yes.
Like in your bones.
Yes.
And on your face.
Yeah, my face feels amazing.
What would you describe the filming process of the vlogs.
Looking like.
What i've noticed is that even from being with you guys.
Quickly like everybody's very very quick on the spot.
Yeah.
But i also saw david redo a few takes which,
Duh, happens all the time in production.
Right.
So like how would you say the filming process goes and.
Like how's being funny on camera.
It's weird.
I'm so bad at it.
So like, it's weird because everyone vlogs so differently.
Yeah.
David is very like funny, quick and then.
Super fast.
Like honestly, most of the things happen actually happen.
It's just that he didn't like catch it on time.
Yeah.
Or like someone's interrupting, so we do it again.
Yeah.
And then if it looks scripted, that's probably why.
Well yeah.
I dunno, it's kinda stressful cos he's like.
Can you say that again.
And then everyone is looking at you and you're like,
I don't want to, i won't sound natural.
Yeah, it's always awkward yeah.
I think i need to bake you but i don't,
I've never baked.
Okay.
Well not in this way.
You got one minute to figure it out.
Um, okay.
Oh, this is probably it.
Laura mercier come through girl.
Come through girl.
I watch a lot of your videos i always see this.
Happening so i'm just gonna do this and pretend.
I'm on the same level.
So you're already a sister.
I'm such a sister.
I always see you guys tweeting me and it's.
Always so cute.
Oh my god i'm obsessed with you.
Like this is like stressful for me,
Like i'm nervous.
Why.
I don't know.
I'm just like a fan too.
So it's just like what am i doing right now.
Aw, do you watch a lot of make up videos.
I do, i think they're really soothing.
I like watching cos it's so interesting what people can.
Do, like it's literally an art form.
Yeah.
And so cool.
And i like how yours is like no.
Can i finish my sentence.
Yeah please.
I like how you're.
Very like, you don't need make up.
It's just like something to.
It's funsies.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's just art.
Alright, well thank you for doing step number two,
But alas, your time is over.
So we have to move on to vlog squad number, number three.
And continue this make-over.
So we'll see you in a little bit sister.

How've you been.
I've been the best in the last two days.
Since i haven't seen you.
Good.
If i do the eyebrows i'm safe because.
You don't have to really do anything to.
The eyebrows before you draw in the eyebrows right.

Stand still, stand still.
So after we did our collab did you feel a little bit.
More prepared for this makeover today.
Where you paying attention at all.
Well i can't really pay attention to my own face really.
Okay.
Because when i was editing the video i didn't know.
What you where doing so like it was just i was looking.
For the funny moments.
Right.
Or like the very genuine moments no really what.
You was doing to my face.
Okay.

I don't want to touch your face but.
I need to touch your face.
Go for it , go for it.
Okay.
I don't want to touch your face, i don't.
Want to fuck it up.
Why don't you just put your hand around my regular neck.
So we have been bonding recently because i am in love.
With jeff i think.
Yeah.
If you think there's the possibility of me hooking up.
With one of the vlog squad members who would you say.
It would be and why.
Hmm.
I don't know about jeff, i wouldn't put jeff on the.
Top of the list.
But, i know somebody else.
Who.
Want to make a guess.
Dirty dom.
Yep.
No you know though when i went to your birthday party.
Which we talked about it your video.
Yeah.
Dom tried to make out with me.
He, are you serious.
Yeah.
That's really funny but did you, did you let him.
No.
Why not.
Its disgusting.
I know that's disgusting.
You have standards.
I have standards.
You know james, you know what this is starting.
To look like how you used to do your eyebrows.
Like three years ago.
Zane.

I thought you where actually going to be kind.
Of like stand offish.
Really.

Wow you didn't come prepared, i can't believe you didn't.
Come prepared, kind of very just like not mean but kind of.
Very very businessy and like alright come on zane.

That did not happen though.
No i thought you where going to be like that.
That is what i was saying. it though you where going to.
Be like that.
Oh.
But you ended up being the complete opposite and.
I felt really comfortable when i was in here and.
I was really happy you are very nice.
Oh you are.
I remember on the way home i was telling natalie.
Dude i can't believe he was that nice, i thought he was.
Going to be the complete opposite.
Really.
Yeah just like seeing how much you cared about what.
Was on my video, i don't know you just like cared.

There's a lot of powder on your face.
Okay.
It looks good to me.
Okay.
I've got a feeling i gotta make it look better.
This is so true.
Okay.
I remember when everybody said you were gonna be the.
Weakest link in the intro you can't listen.
Did they say that.
You where right there.
Who said that.
Everybody.
What do ya mean.
Did you miss that.
Did they actually say that about me.
Yeah.
So like, you're only as strong as your weakest link.
Jonah.
Just, just run your clock and i'll tell you what.
I'm gonna do.
Okay, ready.
Yeah.
Jonah, you've got five minutes on the clock.
Oh jesus, don't hate me, don't say it like that.
Ready.
Yeah, ready.
3,2,1 go.
Okay i have to tell you something funny okay.
Okay.
When i first saw you in david's vlogs,
I never watched any comedy ever.
So i really thought you were jonah hill for a second.
No.
I was like oh my god, david has jonah hill in his video.
You actually thought that.
Yeah, swear to god.
And then i realized, not jonah hill.
He's a cool guy, jonah's a cool guy.
Never met him but he's cool.
Okay.
You know what else is cool.
Only having four minutes left.
Four minutes left.
Are you serious.
You started the clock.
I told you.
No, you're cheating.
You were literally just in conversation with me.
You were supposed to be going.
21 now, come on.
Do we use water.
No.
Is this perfume.
No.
What is this stuff.
Your face just melts.
It says.
Go, go do something.
You know what bro, i honestly do think you wasted.
My time.
And you asked me questions.
And you really tricked me into this.
I told you i was gonna ask everybody questions.
So what would you say was the worst thing you've.
Had to do for the videos.
Jumping the moped over the pool.
That's dangerous.
Good, good, good choice.
Why do you think.
Is it.
Yes.
Why do you think you're so down to be.
To do crazy things for the videos.
I don't know dude,
It's just like to the camera,
My blood just boils and i just wanna get really really.
Good content.
Okay.
It just happens,
This is for the eyes.
Uh huh.
It feels like it is, cos there's like a little brush.
On there.
Is it.
Yeah.
You just didn't wanna say.
I'm scared.
Okay, from what i've noticed from a lot of the videos,
Is that, out of all the people i feel david tends to.
Surprise you the most with pranks and bets.
Do you live your life in constant fear.
Absolutely.
I feel like this is a prank right here dude.
What do you think is gonna happen next.
I'm not sure.
Oh my god the audition prank was,
Broke my heart.
Yeah, that shit prank broke me as a human.
So you actually do do acting right.
Yeah i'm an actor.
Really.
I do comedy act, i mean yeah,
It's what i'm trying to be i guess.
Okay.
A comedy actor.
Okay.
But no, the um.
No, are you serious.
I was almost done.
Stop, give me the make up.
Oh my gosh, who.
Oh no.
That's not good to hear.
I don't know i'm really a bit concerned about.
They eyes, i don't know.
I'm guessing jonah did the eyes before this.
You'd be guessing correctly.
Oh no.
They're terrible, i feel so bad for you.
Okay, i'm nervous, but i think i know what i'm doing.
I like to convince myself i know a lot about make-up.
Okay, so what, where you paying attention during.
Me and zane's video.
Yeah a little bit.
Okay, professional mua.
So, i'm looking at you now,
I don't think you've done bronzing or contouring,
Or even highlighting.
But, i think we have to start with bronzing first, right.
Right.
I can't tell you.
I think what, i think bronzing is when you focus.
On the areas where the sunlight hits your face.
Or like where you.
Am i right.
You're a professional make-up artist matt.
So you have five minutes on the clock.
Okay.
Ready to get started and get as much of my glam done.
As you can possibly can.
Alright.
Are you ready.
Yes, yes.
Are you sure.
Yes james i'm ready, i'm ready, i'm ready.
3,2,1 go.
Okay, i'll open up this palette and,
Okay, well it seems like you use this one a lot though,
So actually i'm gonna go with this one.
Okay cool.
Alright.
How long have you been in the vlog squad for.
I don't know, like two years.
Are you shaking.
Yes, i'm shaking.
I don't wanna mess up, i don't wanna make this any worse.
Than what it already is.
Okay, okay two years now.
Yes, two years.
And how would you say it's changed your life.
It's changed my life,
In many ways.
I'm so happy that i'm surrounded by friends,
Who have such a great sense of humor and like love.
And support each other.
It's honestly like one big family.
Yeah.
And i can't complain.
Well speaking of something good like what's your.
Favorite part about the blogs, cos i noticed.
David likes, you guys definitely like to do lots of.
Positive things too.
Yes.
Lots of free cars, lots of makeovers, fun things.
Yeah, i think.
I guess my favorite thing is just having everybody laugh.
I don't know.
Yeah.
All the laughter and stuff, it's just non stop and.
A lot of people say, oh no this is all fake it's just.
All about the laughter.
No this was a genuine quick comedic.
Quick quip.
Yeah.
Everybody is, i mean it's like straight up like improv.
And i love that the vlog squad keep you on your toes.
And stuff.
Yeah.
There's so much footage in one video.
It's always entertaining to watch.
I feel like i'm wanting to do bronze but i'm like.
Contouring you with bronzer.
It's okay.
So don't hate me, don't hate me.
I love you.
I like that face, i keep thinking you're trying.
To kiss me right now,
But you're just.
That's number nine.
Maybe like a little bit of your chin.
It's important to also contour your jawline right.
To hide double chins.
Definitely.
We need to teach zane that.
I've done like okay on this side,
This side is looking pretty rough.
Okay you have six seconds to fix it.
It's not balanced, it's not balanced out.
You have six seconds to fix it.
Okay, okay, okay.
There we go.
Are you, ok.
Time.
You know what i'm proud, you know.
Dare to fail.
Right.
Thank you james.
Thank you so much matt.
Thank you.
Okay bye, will you grab the next one.
Yes.
Number six.
Clean up crew is here.
We need it.
I liked you better without the make-up.
Are you ready.
Yeah.
Okay, analyze your face.
Oh, it's kind of a mess.
I didn't realize it was gonna be this bad.
Who screwed this up this bad.
A lot of people.
Okay.
We started pretty strong.
This is why i didn't wanna go after jonah.
Yeah, i have a lot to do, well.
I'm glad i'm here.
Me too, thank you so much for joining us here today david.
I see the foundation is set.
Yeah.
A little bit of eyeliner.
I don't even know anything about make-up but i know.
This is completely wrong.
Is there an eraser.
Where i can just erase it all.
We do have make-up wipes if you want something.
Okay, i'm going to.
You're gonna have five minutes on the clock.
Do you know what you wanna do next.
Yeah, yeah.
I wanna put something under your eyes.
Okay.
Because there's a lot going on,
And i kinda wanna balance it out.
Cos right now i don't know where to look but i wanna.
Just be looking in your eyes.
Okay.
Well david dobrik, you're about to have five minutes.
On the clock for this make-up relay.
I only need two.
Great, are you ready to go.
Yeah okay.
Your time starts now.
This is what i need.
Oh the james charles x morphe iconic palette.
I use this at home actually.
For what.
For everything, every morning.
I'm glad you have it here because.
Okay, great.
Oh wow, yeah.
David, what made you wanna start the vlog squad.
And do daily vlogs with everybody.
I mean.
Well almost daily.
I didn't go in thinking starting we're gonna make.
A vlog squad.
Really.
This is so funny, i'm about to screw this up even more.
No don't, make it look good.
Cos we were all doing vine together.
Yeah.
So then we kinds just started youtube just naturally.
Yes.
Liza actually got me into vlogging,
Because she had a vlog camera so i like wanted to.
Give it a shot.
When i started vlogging, like,
It wasn't really forced.
Like i didn't feel like i had to do youtube,
To like survive.
So like, we were just literally just having fun.
And filming everything, so it was great.
Then it just turned you into a big squad that films.
All the time.
Yes, 100%.
Speaking of, what does your normal filming schedule.
Look like and also how long does it take you to.
Edit your videos.
This is interesting to me, because you seem to film.
A lot.
Sure, sure.
Yeah, so i have three, three and half hours of footage.
Every vlog.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go up top a little bit.
Okay.
I love going up top a little bit.
It's also so crazy having a serious conversation.
With you while i'm literally going.
Yeah, so about three to three and a half hours of footage.
Of vlog, then it takes me like 12 hours to edit.
Maybe 14.
This is so intimate.
Yes.
Like doing somebody's make-up is like,
I feel like i'm on date with you.
Oh hey, i love that.
It feels like we're having sex.
Oh.
I don't know about all that.
Suddenly your time is up.
What was i saying before it got so hot in here.
You looked like you just got socked in the face.
David.
I screwed it up, i'm sorry.
It's okay.
Let me fix it real quick, how much time do i have.
Keep going, don't worry about it, just keep going.
You have about two minutes left.
I just need to blend it in that's honestly,
All i need to do.
Okay, okay.
So it seems like when you're filming skits you tend to.
Just record everything and take the best footage, right.
100%.
So how do you even plan all the stuff out in the videos.
Like what does the creative process look like, that's.
What i wanna know because as a beauty guru it's hard.
Sure, sure.
To come up with new ideas all the time, but i feel.
Like you all do the craziest things every single.
Time it's a new vlog.
Yeah, no there is no creative process.
We literally have no ideas going into every video.
Okay.
It's kinda just like you record whatever and then.
You turn your days into a trailer.
Yeah.
So you just put the best moments in.
Okay.
That's such a fun way to look at it actually.
It's like, it's like.
I always say if you edit the movie titanic down to.
Three minutes you can turn it into a comedy movie.
And that's like what my life is.
It's not necessarily, we're not like funnier than any other.
A sinking ship, but you can make it funny.
Friend group.
Exactly.
We're not like funnier than any other group, but , i.
We just know how to put a funny video together.
Sometimes, and sometimes they suck.
Cool i love that.
Honestly, i think this is better, do you know why.
Why.
Cos when i walked in it looked like you messed up.
Your make-up on accident.
Yeah.
But now it looks like you messed up your make-up.
On purpose.
I have a very quick question for you by the way.
Yeah.
How's the adsense.
Brutal.
Brutal.
I mean brutal.
I love how the first time i met you by the way.
At zane's birthday party you asked me what does your.
Adsense look like.
Dude, because.
And then you saw it.
Yeah, i saw your adsense.
I wanna see yours.
I went home and started crying.
I'm gonna show you right now.
James charles reacts to how much money i make.
Oh god. perfect way to end your segment.
Here you go.
Yeh, it's not good.
Why is it that low.
I don't know, can i have a job.

This look ok it's you.
Well my biggest thing was i felt like i could do.
Everything except for eyeshadow.
Okay.
But now i'm coming in here feeling like i have to help.
The eyeshadow but i don't do eyeshadow.
Okay.
I'm gonna wing it.
You're gonna have, okay great.
Just like jonah did.
Oh so he did.
He's the weakest link.
He's literally horrible.

On the clock get as much done as you possibly can.
Are you ready for this make-up relay race.
No.
This is bad, i'm sorry.
Three.
You look the worst.
Go sister.
Okay, i'm hoping this doesn't stain.
I'm just kidding, i'm just kidding.
I have a real question for you.
Okay.
So, one of the kind of running jokes in the vlog squad.
Is that you hook up with boys.
Okay.
How many of the vlog squad members have you hooked.
Up with.
But like hooked up as in.
At least like made out.
Okay so, one, two,
Three, four.
Four, i think.
It could be more.
Okay.
I'm trying to think.
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
I'm looking at you and like this is the worst.
There's like, someone that i'd ship you with.
Okay, who, who.
I'd ship you with jeff so hard.
Okay.
But i don't know,
Wait, can i use this beauty blender.
Yeah.
I feel like i made this look even worse.
Oh god, okay.
Oh no.
Okay, question two because obviously people do make.
The jokes about you hooking up guys a lot too and.
Obviously i just made a joke, but.
I don't know if anybody even remembers but we used to be.
Really, really close friends and we hung out for a long.
Period of time. - we did.
Obviously me and your friends make those type of jokes.
All the time, but is there a limit to what type of jokes.
You let people make in the vlogs.
Like, is there even a limit.
I don't really care that much because like i know.
Who i am and i know that,
They're not true.
They were probably true at one point.
I'm not gonna say there's also stuff like he's been like.
Please let me put it in, and then like paid me.
To put it in.
What's the most amount of money david has paid you to.
Put something in the vlog.
You have to tell me that.
I don't remember, probably like a thousand.
Or two thousand dollars.
This was like, this was like when i needed money and.
I wasn't making money.
Okay, no i love that though.
Now i'm not.
You gotta do what you gotta do.
Now i'm gonna unleash my inner artist.
Okay, please do.
I actually bought this palette.
You know that right.
Did you.
Yeah.
Did you use code james for 10% off your purchase.
That's a thing.
Yeah.
Oh no.
Wow.
I'm so fake.
That was good timing, i can't believe you were that fake.
Yeah, i'm kinda fake.
This collab needs to be over right now.
I'm sorry, wait i didn't know that.
Well, i mean i just gave you extra money.
Yeah, thanks girl.
I did not even contribute other than like fixing.
Other people's mistakes.
You always contribute.
I'm sorry, i'm sorry.
It's okay.
At least i took the bottom off.
Hey, it's a team effort at the end.
Yeah.
The end product is all that matters it's not.

Any of it but i.
You know what i remember when you was living in miami.
That you were a member of the bad girls' club.

Gonna come to right.
Oh definitely.
Yeah, do you trust me to cut your hair.
I don't know.
It's not like make-up you can't just was it off.
That's true.
I'd trust you with anything at this point.
Anything huh.
Yeah.
Do you wanna just, do you have any like oils.
Maybe we could do like a full body massage here.
No but we can definitely find one.
Okay, we'll save that for the end.
Okay, great.
After the video ends when we cut.
So we'll put this on and then that's it right.
Yeah.
The make-ups done.
I guess so.
You look like you're going out to the grammy's.
Are you going to the grammy's.
No.
You would be doing something its,
Like a crazy event after you've filmed this video.
I, with this make-up on.
Yeah.
Do you wanna be my plus one, my date on the red carpet.
I would love to.
Wow, that's really cute.
I've never been to the grammy's.
Me either.
Who's your favorite person that you've gotten to.
Cut so far.
Oh that smells nice, can i have some too.
Sure.
Oh wow, that's so refreshing.
Yeah.
So my favorite person i've got to cut so far.
That's a good question.
I actually gave a homeless guy a haircut and it.
Was awesome to see how happy he was after.
Aw.
But also you know, i'll drop a few names since.
I'm here.
I did give amber rose her shaved head.
You did.
Yeah, she's so sweet, she's the nicest person.
Yeah.
Then next up there's you, that's all i care about.
After that i'm retiring.
I'm giving my clippers away,
That's it i'm wrapping up the show.
Okay, i love that.
Yeah, that's it, we're done.
You look great.
Thanks jeff.
I hope i didn't mess up too much.
That's okay, you could have done anything.
And i would have been happy with it.
Are we done.
So can we cut and do the massage.
We can cut and do whatever your heart desires.
Yeah, what do you say we get out of here and we.
Can talk about that massage a little more.
We can get out of here and talk about.
Whatever you want.
Let's go, hop up here.
I'm so ready for this.
You must weigh about 80 pounds.
Wow jeff we're going to get married.
Okay are you guys ready to see.
Crowd yes.
That you all did as a group.
Crowd yes.
3, 2, 1.
Crowd oh.
You look so different.
It's okay.
It's definitely not that bad at all.
It looks like you got,
It looks like you got bad lip injections.
You look like you're 20 years older.
I'm just, it's weird seeing what it went to after me.
That eyeshadow looks a lot better than when i saw.
Okay.
Can i say, can i say something.
After i did the coloring to your eyes,
A lot of people came down and was like,
Someone really fucked it up.
I guess it was me.
But now what they did with it, it looks really good.
Oh yes, professional.
It's like lighter, i love it.
Who did the worst.
Do you actually want me to tell you.
Yeah.
Don't get offended.
Who was the weakest link.
Crowd jonah.
Who was the best.
James is like the best kisser, that's jeff.
Is that why the lipstick's messy.
Okay, so i was really impressed with heath, zane and matt.
All knew what exactly what to do.
They all knew exactly what they needed to do,
Like heath was i'm gonna do primer, then foundation.
Looks like there's a new sister squad.
I was actually really thoroughly impressed,
