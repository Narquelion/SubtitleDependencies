What's up.
It's collins key and welcome to the thursday vlog.
Now for today's video, i'm coming back at you guys,
With a brand new challenge,
But of course i can't do this alone,
So i've got someone to help me out,
My little brother devan key.
Eh, what's up.
He was under that table for a long time.
Yeah, my knees really hurt right now.
Yeah, for today's video,
We are doing a brand new challenge.
And it's the whipped cream, pie in face challenge.
And so basically, how this challenge works,
Is it's like a russian roulette game,
Used with whipped cream.
We have this little spinner thingy right here,
So you spin the spinner, whatever number it lands on,
You put your head in this little thingy here.
And you kinda twist and you go one, two.
Ah, geez.
It will pop up, at some point, randomly.
Hopefully, you don't get pied in the face.
Now were going to be doing a whole bunch of rounds,
Starting off of course, with the classic whipped cream.
And then we're going to be moving up.
To even grosser and grosser things.
And for the final one, he doesn't even know what it is,
But it is going to be our least favorite thing,
In the entire world.
So make sure you guys watch this entire challenge,
To find out what the last item is.

Together let's jump.
Right into the challenge.
Challenge.
We never get that.
Let's try it one more time.
Three, two, one.
Together let's jump right into the challenge.
Oh.
Awkward and everything.
Alright, to determine who goes first,
We're going to be using this spinner right over here.
We're each gonna give it a flick, give it a spin.
And whoever lands on a higher number,
That person has to go first, so devan, take it away.
Devan yeah, that that was all good.
That was a good spin.
Collins that was a good spin.
No.
Oh, so you're probably gonna go first, for sure.
No.
So i just have to get-.
Please be a five, please be a five.
Collins if i just get like a four or a three.
Yes.
No.
I got a two, alright, so devan, you have to go first.
Let's see how many times,
You're gonna have to click it.
Devan please don't be five, please don't be five.
Four.
Alright, so devan, put your head on the special thingy.
Okay.
Yep and we're gonna put some whipped cream on here.
And this is the first one, so we really wanna -.
I'm terrified.
You have to do it four times, so go for it devan.
Okay wait, i have to make, okay wait.
Okay.
Together oh.
Ah.
Okay, okay.
Oh, sorry.
I didn't mean that.
I can't open my eyes.
Are you, like, okay.
Well, i'm not opening my eyes.
I can't open my eyes.
Well since devan is incapacitated right now,
We're gonna take a quick break.
To make sure that we can get him,
I don't know, some paper towels.
We'll come right back at you guys with some brand new stuff.
Done.
Is this underneath the nose.
Oh.
It's like shaving right here.
It's on my neck.
Is that you're finger.
That was round one, so devan takes an l,
For the first round and.
Together literally on the first one.
So you got cat food here.
I'm just gonna give this a spin, so let's see what we got.
Alright.
I got five, no.
Together oh.
Put it all on.
Alright, go.
One, two, three, four, five.
Ah.
Oh. he got it on-.
My eye.
Yes.
Tissue to the rescue.
Poor collins.
I feel like you're wiping more into my eye.
Alright, so devan, you finally get your first point there.
Yeah.
Take that, spin it.
I take that w, bro.
That win.
I take that w.
Oh my god, that stuff is so gross.
What did i get.
Together a four.
So, i'm just gonna use what's on the table already.
Wait, what.
And here we go.
Woah, i thought we doing one round of each thing.
No, no, no.
Now it's your turn.
Two of each.
One, two, three.
Go, okay.
Yeah.
Let's see what i got.
Five, no.
Oh.
One, two, three, four, five.
This thing is broken.
This thing didn't even come close to my face.
Well, i think that we figured out.
That cat food is kind of a fail for this thing,
Cause i don't think it can leverage.
It just looks so gross, dude.
Oh.
This whole thing's just nasty.
Voiceover 20 minutes later.
Alright, to be fully honest with you guys,
This challenge is not going, at all, how we expected.
We tried to get crazy with it.
And throw in some, like, cat and dog food.
And just can't handle it.
We wanted to make it really fun and funny for you guys,
But this thing is just failing miserably.
And so, you know what.
We still want to make this video amazing for you guys.
Slammed it down.
Well i'm kinda frustrated with it,
Cause it's not working.
We still wanna make this video amazing for you guys.
And so we are switching it up.
We are making a brand new challenge.
So, disregard everything we've done so far.
Here is how the brand new challenge works.
We are still going to be using this thing.
And the spinner over here,
But since this thing cannot handle.
This awesomeness of this video,
What we're gonna be doing is were using these pie shells.
We're basically gonna fill them up.
With the different things that we would be putting on here.
Exactly.
So round 1 is going to be whipped cream,
So we're gonna fill this whole thing.
With whipped cream, spin a number.
Still the same thing where we put our heads here,
But instead of this thing hitting us in the face,
Because it cannot accomplish that, unfortunately,
We're gonna be smacking each other with a pie in the face.
So, let's jump into this brand new pie,
A real pie in the face challenge.
Alright, so wound-.
Wound 1.
Wound 1 is whip cweam.
Alright, there it goes.
Here's pie number uno.
Gonna spin.
And let's see what number i get.
A five.
No.
Here we go, let's see,
One, two, three, no.
Yeah.
You get a pie to the face, you get a pie to the face.
Don't hurt me.
Ready.
Yep.
Three, two.
Oh.
Hello, i literally can't hear anything out.
Of this side of my head.
That went in my ear.
Literally every time i do a video, it gets in your ear.
No it's in my ear, dude.
No, i don't like it.
No.
It's what you get bro.
What.
Dude, it's in my ear.
It's in my nose.
Alright, here we go, round 2 is going.
To be whipped cream and dog food combined.
Hey, i get to fill it up.
No, i like filling this stuff up.
Alright.
I'm gonna get the dog food here.

Okay, quick pick a number.
