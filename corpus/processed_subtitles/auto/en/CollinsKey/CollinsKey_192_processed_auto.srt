Dude, listen to the bread.
Hold on.
That's like, hard as a rock.
I just realized the stuff on the top,
This is actual squid.
What is this at the bottom.
They look like crushed up peas.
In the reviews they did say.
That this was a little over seasoned.
Ooh.
Ooh.
All you have to do with the noodles.
Is peel them apart just like this.
I don't know if this is normal but i see a vein.
I don't wanna eat my veins.
It's like a nerve.
To try out mine i wanna get a little bit of everything.
I wanna get a little bit of the rock bread.
And i wanna put a little bit of noodles on here like this.
Of course we gotta get some bits of the squid.
Alright, well it's time to find out what.
My squid ink noodles taste like.

Gotta put some of this green stuff on here.
I still don't even know what that is.
Alright, ready.
Set.
Go.
No, you can't just bite it.
That is a bone.
I guess i just gotta use a spoon.
It's so weird.
It's kinda like gelatinous in a way, man.
Whoa.
Three, two, one.
The texture is shuddering.
This is not a favorite of yours.
It's so greasy.
It lives up to it's one star review,
And i give it a half a star.
Whoa.
Alright, we're gonna add this to the blender.
Let's spin the wheels and for this one .
Not again. - whoah.
You challenged us to try the.
Worst reviewed chinese food.
Devan wait, what.
Stinky tofu.
Collins what, i got tripe soup.
I don't even know what this stuff is, man.
Looks kinda like a brain.
I'm confused.
Alright, time to see if mine lives up to it's name.
You ready.
Yup.
I don't smell anything.
Yeah, it's not bad at all.
Ooh.
It's like dog breath.
Just take a whiff.
I can't imagine ordering this, bro.
I feel like this would linger for a week.
Alright, look at that.
Look at that hat stringy looking .
Agh.
Oh boy.
Alright, time to see how this thing tastes.
So here we go, man.
Wait, you know what this is, right.
No, i don't.
It's the inner lining of a cow's stomach.
Nope, done.
That's it.
The mystery wheel picked it though.
You gotta do it.
I guess i'll put some egg on mine.
A little bit of this rice here.
And your stinky tofu.
I didn't choose the stinky life.
Dude, i'm about to eat dog breath that's food.
This is gonna be rough.
You ready.
Yep.
Three, two .
Oh man. - one.
Trying not to breath.
Is it a little bit tough.
Oh boy.
It's spicy.
Devan doesn't like spice.
Man, the eggs.
Mixed with it, man.
Oh.
Oh.
Ah, hey.
Does it smell good.
Not at all.
My review for this would be a zero.
The taste is not worth the breath.
You're gonna have for a week.
I can attest to that.
Your breath's pretty bad right now.
Here we go.
Let's see how this tastes, bro.
I don't even know how to .
Aah.
That perfectly describes how you must feel right now.
So it i guess we just gotta go for it.
Three, two, one.
I have psyched myself up for this one, bro.

Collins it's stuck on there.
Devan stuck on it.
The weirdest thing is that the mac and cheese.
Doesn't look creamy at all, man.
It's just like noodles.
No.
Dude.
It's got lobster meat in it,
But look at this.
It's also got lobster shell.
Dude.
You gotta watch where you eat.
There's other pieces of it too.
Look at this.
Devan guess i'm gonna try to cut mine up.

Dude, how did you now that.
Bro, i study these things.
Alright, it's time to open up mine.
Both whoa.
Devan is that a soggy pretzel.
That's got to be the worst looking pretzel.
I've ever seen.
Can we even call this a pretzel.
I didn't even realize the main event.
These sausage looking things.
Ooh. - hey.
You can literally peel the skin off of it.
Collins ugh.
It's like sludge, bro.
Devan yikes.
Do you have any clue what these are.
Yeah, they're egg noodles.
Well, now it's time for you to try your white sausages.
It's such a weird combo with the pretzel, bro.
I'm just going to put that on the end, there.
We got a kabob.
Or shabob.
I dunno, kabob.
Shabob.
Three, two, one.
Ugh.
It's way too spongy.
I would give it a zero for the soggy pretzel, bro.
Alright, well now let's see how this thingy tastes.
You know the first step, gonna have to.
Pull it apart a little bit.
You just gotta pull it apart.
And get some different textures.
Ooh.
Dude. - ooh.
You pull one little bit.
And the whole thing comes apart, bro.
It's hot.
I think we kinda harmonized there.
Yeah we turned into a siren.
Oh dude that's kinda cool you can.
Pull it apart like that.
Both ooh.
Devan it's steaming.
I'm gonna put that on there.
It's like a little hat.
It's going out for traveling.

They're a little bit oily.
Yeah, that what it said in the reviews.
Dude, this is liver pate.
Wait.

So, oh boy.
Alright, i guess i'm gonna take a bite of this.
So devan, you ready to take a bite of yours.
Now it's time to grab some noodles.
I also gotta get some of this asparagus on here.
I heard it was not the greatest asparagus.
Maybe a little bit damp.
Look at it.
It's a little soggy.
Three .
