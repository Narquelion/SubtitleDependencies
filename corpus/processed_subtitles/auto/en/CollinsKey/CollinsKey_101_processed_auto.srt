What's up guys.
It's collins key.
What, you all laughing at me already.
Them hoodlums.
Not at you, we're laughing with you.
Really, though.
So i'm on my super trippy penny board,
And i just got here to the frickin' queen mary,
Which i just found out this place is haunted,
And she, frickin' maddie over here, troll maker.
Sorry, i knew you weren't gonna come,
So i didn't tell you. - she didn't even tell me.
This place is haunted.
She was like, "yeah, it's like this cool ship hotel.".
I was expecting like suite life on deck 2.0 on this thing.
And apparently people die in the boiler room.
Yo, and i've already been dropped off.
My dad, he's long gone so i can't get back to him now.
This is terrible.
Please tell everyone at home.
Why would you do this to a brotha.
Okay, okay.
A brotha.
I knew you weren't gonna come.
Uh huh.
Because you hate scary things.
Uh huh.
So i just didn't tell you.
I didn't lie, i just didn't mention the fact that.
People have died. - people been dying in there.
I'm actually really uncomfortable with this whole thing.
Worldstarhiphop.
They're on this ledge thing and they're not supposed to be.
There's no one coming.
Maddie collins, scary.
What. - your penny board.
Girl, if you die. - give me your penny board.
No, i'm sorry. - no, no, no.
This is an intervention.
Girl, if you fall off that edge--.
I'm not gonna fall.
It's extremely wide--.
People die here.
That's, very good point.
People do die here, so i'm not gonna.
Give you my penny board. - we're not on the boat yet,
So technically--.
Collins girl, it don't matta.
You finna die.
Give me the penny board, please.
Collins no.
Please.
Collins that penny board will not be going to you.
Someone's gonna come, you need to give it to--.
It don't matta.
Dude, okay, do you think it's gonna be any better.
If you're scooting on a penny board across this.
Says someone coming.
Oh my god.
Yeah.
Ninja status.
So that happened.
What do you not understand about people die on this boat.
You're gonna be like this,
I'm scootin', i'm scootin',
I'm scootin', something goes down pootin',
I'm over to the side, and i'm like trippin',
And then it's like off the edge.
Off the edge.
What happened.
I went-- - yo madison, straight up.
If i could just go-- - you hit some oil.
No, no.
I could just go straight--.
Collins this is a ship, they spout oil.
And i would come back and i would be fine.
A boiler spirit comes pushing you.
I would be fine.
I am a perfect combination of stupid and brave.
But you also told me you're clumsy,
Which does not help your case at all.
Why would i give you a means of death.
That's what my penny board represents right there.
It actually kind of looks like a ghost too,
Which is kind of weird.
Somehow, she convinced me to frickin' come inside.
Of this scary place. - because you love me.
Collins we ran into him.
He's cool. - i am worth.
The possibility of ghosts. - which floor i am on,
By the way.
Maddie you're on my floor.
I am.
Girl in leopard print that's not the cool floor.
Bro time.
I just got to my room.
My hat looks super swaggy right now.
My room's pretty dope.
Ow.
I keep hitting my head on the ceiling.
Ooh, what does this button do.
Oops.
Well, glad we figured that out now.
Did it take off my hat.
Okay.
These goats are tripping with me.
I mean these goat, ghosts.
Ghosts.
Maddie it's three in the morning.
If you can't tell, it's three in the, yeah,
It's three in the morning. - nothing's making sense.
It wasn't that bad, i don't even--.
Were you stuck in your backpack.
Maybe.
Is that even a problem.
Hey guys, like this video if you've ever been stuck.
In your backpack, yes, #thirstyforlikes.
So there's this beautiful view of death.
There's probably been someone who lived in this room.
And like, died.
Why are you so obsessed with people dying.
You're obsessed with your death, collin.
Because that's what this boat's all about.
That's its mo.
Look at this.
This boat was obviously made before people were tall.
Fun fact, did you know that if you're over six foot, two,
You're taller than 94% of the population.
So you. - that's me.
Watch out, i'm gonna be runnin'.
If you're runnin', get out of my way.
Shoot.
Collin. - why would you trip me.
I felt a leg.
Girls no one tripped you.
Ain't my leg. - are you kidding me.
I kid you not, there was a leg.
There was no leg. - there was no leg.
Was this a motherfreakin' ghost.
Maddie now it gets collins,
Out of all the people that it could get.
I made up something cool right now.
Watch this.
Maddie no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
That has to be the coolest thing.
I've ever done in my entire life.
I'm like a giant burrito right now.
Maddie like you're wearing a toga.
I'm like a chipotle burrito.
Burrito is going to bed.
Farewell.
No, no, no. - no, no, no, you have a bed.
Girl in leopard print collins.
Maddie look at him, he's--.
Girl in leopard print he did compact himself.
Into that small group of space.
Collins now i'm like a frickin' ratchet casedilla.
Maddie collin.
Chick, please.
I'm like a chipotle superhero.
So sexy.
Ow, my face.
What's under my bed.
Nothing under my bed.
He's so acrobatic. - maddie collins.
I'm good, i'm good.
I think i have like polar bear disorder.
Maddie bipolar. - yeah.
Maddie oh my god.
Did i mess that up.
Girl in leopard print yeah.
It's the best thing that you've ever said.
Maddie i think i have polar bear disorder.
Girl in leopard print i have polar bear disorder.
I don't like this bed anymore.
Maddie collins, there's another bed.
That one's quite sexier.
This is my side bed.
My main bed.
I'ma chill with my side bed for a minute.
Girl in leopard print is this a metaphor for your life.
Maddie side chicks, main chicks.
I ain't got any chicks.
Come on. - who wants me to be a ninja.
Maddie no, this is gonna end so bad.
Pants, can't do that.
Three, two, one, go.
All right, so i found this piano.
And i'ma try and play it right now.
Woman sir, you can't play the piano.
Collins oh, i can't play it. okay.
