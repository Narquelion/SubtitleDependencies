Who is that.
I don't know.
Maybe you should check.
Look up.
Back right pocket.
Oh.
What is that.
Open door.
Open the door.
That was lame, dude.
Yeah.
Well, i need to go anywhere but here.
So why aren't you in malibu.
Well, i was.
I'm back now.
I've been thinking a lot about what i said, and i mean it.
I want you to be happy and if i thought eddie was right.
For you then i wouldn't be standing here.
But i don't think he is,
And i think,
Maybe i could be.
So your magical pixel girl didn't work out for you.
And i'm like what, your consolation prize.
No, god, it wasn't that at all.
Okay leone was great.
She was funny, she was cool.
Then why aren't you with her right now.
Because.
She what.
You're going to say it's lame.
No i won't.
I promise.
She wasn't you.
God, collins that isn't fair.
You had years to tell me that.
Years.
And now you pick the day i'm moving in with my boyfriend.
What.
Yeah, he's been asking, so i decided to give it a shot.
Look, i understand that you haven't really gotten along.
With him or even liked him, but he loves me.
And he knew what he wanted.
What.
Okay.
What's up baby.
Hey.
I wanted to show you this.
What's up.
Check out this video.
Oh.
Yeah.
Wow.
Okay, i have to go study.
No.
I know.
Babe, i have a test tomorrow.
Yeah don't touch that board, i'm gripping it.
What's up guys, it's collins key and first of all.
I know it's late at night right now.
But i just had to post this.
I had to get this off my mind and yeah, i am aware.
That things have been really crazy on my youtube channel.
For the last few days and there's one more crazy surprise.
That i've got for you guys and i'm doing a meet-up in l.a.
So first of all, even if you don't live in l.a. i still.
Have you covered because this is going to be live-streamed.
On my youtube channel.
So, it doesn't matter where in the world you live, everyone.
Can take part in this, but if you are in l.a.
I would love to see you there.
So, i'm going to put all the information.
You need to know in the description.
It's happening this weekend.
This weekend.
So again, make sure you guys go check out all those details.
And again, we'll be live-streaming it.
So i've got you covered.
I just wanted to do this to say thank you because you guys.
Have been with me throughout this entire process.
And just showed me so much love and support throughout.
This entire thing and i've had a ton of fun.
You guys were figuring out so many clues and i don't know,
I feel like we got closer throughout this entire process.
For me, even though things didn't go exactly how i thought.
They would, but i think what i've learned is that if you're.
Brave enough to just take risks.
And try out new adventures and new experiences,
They don't need to go how you thought.
They would and a lot of times they won't, but that's okay.
That's not the point.
The point is you get to learn about yourself,
About who you want to be, and who you want to be with,
And i think--.
Hey.
Cool if i study here.
Uh so yeah, like i said,
I'd love to see you guys at the meet-up and yeah.
