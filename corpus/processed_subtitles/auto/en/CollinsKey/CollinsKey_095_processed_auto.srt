It looks like a cabbage.
I gotta calm it down and just enjoy kimchi.
I mean, clearly it's being sold.

I'll just count you down, ready.
Three, two, one.
Alright dude, that's enough; that's enough.
I feel so bad for you.

You know what i mean.
Collins the ice cream sundaes, guys, are coming together.
And right now we are on to the next round.
Alright collins, do you want to keep it or switch it.
See, this one is very important because.

This one here, is the one with the ice cream under it.
Okay. three, two, one.
Yeah. - no.
What even is this, what.
Devin hot pickled jalapeno slices.
Dude that's going to be so hot.
My superpowers are on point.

It's not just normal cookies, it's like oreo cookies.
Oh.
Three, two, one.
So jealous man.
Dude what are you doing, you're gonna break through the,
Dude, don't, what are you doing.
That was amazing and i bet yours is going.
To be even better, devin.
Oh yeah, i'm sure it will collins.
I can't wait to see your reaction to this.
Alright, here we go.
I don't think there is anything that could.
Prepare me for this.
Alright, here we go.
Three, two, one.
Oh, it's so hot.
It was just the juice,
You didn't even get any jalapenos in your mouth.
Collins it's almost the same face as.
Your brain freeze face.
Uh huh.
It burns so bad.
We're coming up to the finale and then.
We're gonna be eating the biggest ice cream sundae.
In the entire world and maybe even making a milkshake.
I don't think anything can help me.
Ice cream.
Yeah.
Bro, it's all empty.
If only devin had ice cream to soothe the pain.
This is an important one for you, devin.
You can keep them or switch them.
And if you get ice cream, it will soothe the burning.
In your mouth but if not, it will make it even worse.
So right now, do you want to keep it or switch it.
Bro, i am very aware of the situation.
I'm gonna do your technique of this x-ray vision thing.
Okay great, go for it.
Alright, here we go.
Okay, got it.
I'm gonna switch it.
Here we go. - okay.
Three, two, one.
Yay.
This is what i needed.
Holy cow, that looks delicious.
Dev, watch out for the elbow.
It's like sweet relief.
What flavor is it.
Devin pumpkin cheesecake.
Ah, i feel so much better now.
I'm glad you do, because i don't.
'cause i got cat food.
Friskies, it's like, liver and chicken.
I don't wanna eat it.
Ew.
No matter how many times i've ate cat food,
Doesn't get better.
Smell it. - i don't want to.
Collins i don't know what flavor, i don't know.
What chicken is all blended together.
It looks like a flippin' sponge.
I eat with my face, it's like ha.
There's like, little like, looks like bones in it.
It's all the stuff i'm sure a cat doesn't care about.
A cat is like,
"a bone. give it to me.".
That's my impression of a cat.
Time to eat some cat food.
I'll see you soon my feline friends.
I don't think any cats are watching this collins.
Are you sad by that. i'm sorry.
Yo, if you got a cat, bring a cat.
And the cat can watch this right now,
Cause i'm about to eat some of your food, kitty.
The kitty is like, "no.".
Three, two, one.
Your face right now bro.
The time has finally come to mix up our ice cream sundaes,
So get it in there.
Collins ohmygosh, the wasabi. i forgot about the wasabi.
Devin i forgot about the spam.
There's so much extra stuff in here.
At least i got some sprinkles in here, that's kinda nice.
And this is definitely the weirdest ice cream sundae,
But you know what.
I wanna be able to experience all of these flavors.
At the same time, and just with a big spoonful.
What.
And i won't be able to do that.
So we got one of these blenders here.
We're gonna blend it up into a milkshake,
And then drink them.
Oh, i'm not hype.
Yours looks way better than mine,
But mine has way more ice cream.
But i also have something called spam in mine,
And also jalapeno peppers.
Oh.
You added some to mine.
No, no.
Devin splash guards, splash guards.
All that kimchi.
Oh that looks so gross.
Oh my gosh.
I'm already feeling queasy.
Devin mine does, on the surface,
Look a lot better than yours though.
Oh my gosh, you good.
No, what, how could it be good.
Collins dude, it's gonna splash.
Ah, it's on my fingers.
And the spam, the spam is coming.
Oh snap.
Okay, time to pop on the top.
Pop the tops.
Look, it's like dripping down the side.
Full blast, we're going max.
Ready. three, two, one.

Feel like it's good.
Mine is up to the max, here we go.
Oh.
Collins all the pig skins, ohmygod.
Done.
All the clear bits in there, and it's the pig skins.
You know what devin.
There's actually one more.
Wild card i want to throw in this right now.
Wait, no, why.
This is already a wild card.
Collins anchovies.
Devin no.
Collins here's how it works right now.
Rock, paper, scissors.
Whoever loses, has to put anchovies in.
Bro, it's going down.
And we're going three rounds.
Each round the loser has to put this in, okay.
We might both get it, you ready.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
Bam. - no.
Devin got one anchovy, you gotta pop in right now.
Oh, it got on my fingers.
Ew, it's like oil.
It smells so bad.
Collins alright bro, pop it in. pop it in.
Alright, next round, here we go.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
Yes. - no.
I'm so not happy, how do i get this off.
Collins dude i do not want to do this.
This has turned into an oily, slippery mess.
Collins alright, here we go, three, two, one.
Oh it's not coming out.
Final round, here we go.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
No. - yes.
Collins ugh, the oil's everywhere.
