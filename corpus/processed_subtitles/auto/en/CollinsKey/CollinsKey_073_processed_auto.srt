In a nice little, nice little sample of juice right here.
Collins. - what.

All in all that went a lot better than it could've.
Devan all right, finished up the boba,
This is gonna be perfect for frankenstein's brain cell.
Collins luckily i was able to collect.
All the berry juice, i've heated it up,
Mixed in a whole bunch of agar agar,
And now it is time to cool it down on some dry ice.

Spider webs here man. - whoa.
Who knew, all you need is a power drill.
And a head massager to become a superhero man.
This is legit.
This hair is coming out and it's coming out nicely man.
Devan that is looking good man.
It's a big chunk of hair.
Right here dude. - wow.
Holy cow, could you imagine finding this in your drain.
All of us enjoy lovely luscious hair like this.
It doesn't make me wanna eat it.
That's the whole thing about pennywise,
You don't wanna eat pennywise cause he's goal's scare you.
Devan all right, for my next thing,
I'm making frankenstein's brain tubes.
Now, all i need is to just pour this in.
Collins whoa.
Yes.
Look at that.
Look at that.
Look at that. - collins it's not going in.
Devan it's not going in.
I think i should squeeze it devan,
Cause my hands,
Yup, they're made for squeezing.
So here we go, woohoo.
Oh, yeah.
Collins there we go, just thought.
I would just give it a quick little squeeze like that.
It didn't do anything. - i don't think that worked.
All right, filled up some tubes,
Now it's time to blow the noodles out from the tube.
Here we go, three, two, one.
Both oh.
Three, two, one.

Are you kidding me.
It got all over me - you just,
Blasted me in the, there we go.
And now you're red just like me.
Got some balloons here and now it's time.
To stick them in some liquid nitrogen.
Collins now tell me.
You aren't a visionary, at first,
I had no idea how i could use balloons for pennywise,
But now i think i can actually use it for his forehead.
So here we go. - well before you do that.
I have my frankenstein head right here.
That's actually exactly frankenstein's head devan.
What, no it's gonna take a ton of work.
What are you talking about. - no, no,
I mean that can looks exactly like frankenstein's head.
We're gonna move the liquid nitrogen.
Very carefully. - devan you're really.
Serious about this.
Oh i'm very serious.
And here's the thing devan, seet.
We're gonna be moving frankenstein's head right here,
And devan, - it's just a can.
Grab my finger.
What, okay. - grab my finger,
And pull the lever.
What lever.
The lever devan.
What.
Pull the lever. - when did that get there.

Wait so, - no way.
How do you feel right now.
I donno, i'm still pretty new to this.
Yo, franky.
Where'd he go man.
You pulled the lever.
Yeah dude, it was getting weird.
Pull the lever. - you didn't think.
You just pulled the lever - that was weird.
On your bean frank.
He doesn't even really have a brain yet.
Without any further-a-do, it's time to drop a balloon.
Into the liquid nitrogen.
Do not try this at home.
So here we go, are you ready.
Both three, two, one.
Oh.
It's just bouncing.
It's floating.
Here we go, just gonna push it in.
Oh my gosh.
Look at it, it's deflating.
Now freezing the balloon will make it perfect.
For pennywise's forehead.
Look at it bro. - what, i got avocados.
Look at it here we go, we'll place that.
Right over here like this. - oh,
Look at this. - so close to the avocados.
Collins look at it man.
Devan no.
Collins holy cow. - devan it's refilling up.
It has a mind of it's own.
Collins this thing is alive right now man.
Oh my gosh.
Flip it over, flip it over, flip it over.
Collins that's a lot of avocado's,
You're making quick work of it.
What're you doing that for.
Devan this is for frankenstein's head dude.
This is rapid rise,
Instant yeast. - that's rapid rise.
Collins you've gotta have - devan yes.
Collins the instant yeast.
Well i gotta say i was hopin the liquid nitrogen.
Would help me out, but unfortunately it popped the balloons,
It ruined the integrity, so now,
We're gonna take this bottle of water,
And then gonna fill it up.
So here we go are you ready.
Three, two, one.
I'm just gonna squeeze like that.
So here we go just gonna have to do.
A couple, couple powerful squeezes,
So here we go, power up.
Perfect.
All right there we go, tied off the balloon,
And this thing is looking fantastic.
You can't do this with guac.
Why is it so hard.
Because this is frankenstein's head.
All right, now i'm gonna add this into the can.
Look at my balloon man, you fling it like this.
Devan all right, filled this thing up,
Now i've gotta pop it in the oven.
I'm gonna place this right over here,
And we gotta wait a second for that to finish, don't we.
Yup.
Man twenty minutes later.
All right just popping this thing.
Outta here just like this.
Collins holy cow.

Oh my gosh.
It's so satisfying. - devan wow.
I'm telling you devan, you have no idea,
How awesome my pennywise is gonna be.
Boom, okay ice-mold is done.
Now i've just gotta core the center of it out like this.
This is a perfect cavity for his brain.
When i start putting it all together,
My pennywise is gonna be on another level.
Yo these monsters are getting very close to being done,
But there's still one more big thing we gotta add to them.
I'm making the dye for frankenstein's skin,
And you might be wondering why it's purple,
And that is because it's about to change.
Please hold this open for a second,
All right here we go, just gonna place a pretzel.
On the inside.
This pretzels gonna act as the front of pennywise's face.
All right devan, here i'm just gonna.
Suck up some of this good juice like this.
Both three, two, one.
Oh it had the squeach.
Devan so i got some vinegar right here.
And we're gonna pour this in.

Are you kidding me dude.
Look at you.
Look at this.
It hit the pineapple.
Look at that.
I'm sorry.
For the first time, i was unscathed.
Yeah, i act like a giant blast shield.
Collins now we gotta coat the pretzel.
In a whole bunch of yogurt.
That way it's perfect for the front.
Of pennywise's face.
All right now, it's time to turn this thing green.
Both three, two, one.
Devan it's supposed - collins keep going.
Devan to be a dark green, - collins keep going.
Devan look at that. - collins oh my gosh.
We've got all the elements,
And now it's time to compile them.
Into the ultimate edible art sculpture.
All right, status update,
I'm still single. - it's been about.
Two full days, yeah, devan is still single.
And so am i, so yeah.
It's been two full days of working on our art pieces,
And this is all we've come up with.
I've had a whole bunch of friends help me out.
With this thing, which was very nice.
Devan i'm gonna pop my frankenstein head.
On there, this is still a work in progress.
Collins all right, while you do that.
I'm gonna paint the mouth with some edible paint over here.
All right, so we've just gotta.
Keep putting these things together man,
No other way then forward if you know what i mean.
Sure.
You can't go backwards.
We've got the finished monsters,
And these are the most incredible art pieces.
We've ever made on the channel ever.
And i've gotta level with you guys.
This wasn't all me, i had to get some friends together,
Took about a week, all ten of us put this thing together.
I have to say, i'm not even mad,
That thing looks amazing.
Collins before we reveal, it's time to find out.
Who the puppies think created the better art piece.
Dude look and they're so excited,
They're so excited to pick the art piece,
So here's the thing guys,
Frankenstein, or pennywise okay.
So here we go, fluffy, i want you to,
Just focus right here. - devan i think they like.
Their toy.
Collins right over here, so which one do you like.
Are you gonna go pennywise, frankenstein, pennywise, oh man.
Devan that's a leaf.
And you know leaves are green,
And frankenstein's green. - collins but that's.
A dinosaur and dinosaurs are like a scary monster.
Like pennywise is, that is green,
I don't think this is very conclusive,
So i don't think they have a clear opinion,
So you know, let's just do the reveal.
We put a tone of work into this,
So here is the big reveal.
Both three, two, oh.
Five second subscribe challenge, we want to see.
If you can subscribe to this channel.

Right now.
Both three, two, one ta-da.

We got the edible monsters and now its time to find out.
How they taste, as well as reveal their secret surprises.
I gotta say mine, the hair, is just freaking me out.
It looks so weird.
Dude, your whole one is freaking me out.
I'm gonna have nightmares about this thing.
And as mine was drying it got a little cracked.
But i actually think it helped the aesthetic you know.
I donno man, he needs some moisturizer bro.
We gotta lotion this man up.
But that's not the point man.
He's frankenstein, he's made.
From all these different pieces you know.
All right, it kinda helps it out.
So which one do we want to eat first.
Devan oh man, it's such a toss up,
They're both so amazing,
I donno, i think lets eat mine first.
All right, so we'll eat your frankenstein first.
Then we'll come down to pennywise.
And mine has a very special surprise.
In the top of his head,
Yeah that's right it was hollow,
So i was able to but his brain in there.
And some other fun stuff, you ready for this.
Wait, so you're just gonna.
Peel back the top of his head.
Yes, i'm just gonna peel open his head and you'll see.
What.
I was already kinda creeped out by your guy.
But knowing he has a hollow head.
I'm like lowkey scared that he's gonna like jump out at me.
Boo. - hey.
You can't do that, you can't do that.
Whew, i need to walk that one off, holy cow, okay.
Devan i'm just gonna peel off the top of his head.
Yo be gentle, you gotta be gentle.
His neck is like,
I built this monster, i know how it works.
Whoa.
No looking.
Don't look in, it's a surprise.
Now i've just gotta take one of these things.
And drop it in to see the activation, you ready.
When you drop it in, is it just gonna like,
Shoot out top like a volcano.
Or what's gonna happen. - it very well might do that,
He might come to life, he might jump at you,
You know, who knows.
The last part, what.
His eyes might glow you know,
A lot of things could happen.
You ready for this.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, lets,
No you gotta come close.
No i think, let's,
You've gotta come more this way.
Okay, oh man all right.
Both three, two, one.
Drop it in.
Both whoa.
Collins his brains are bubbling bro.
What on earth.
Beat that.
It doesn't smell so great though.
Man, his brains are stinky.
Whew.
Sharp.
Yep.
Very tangy, goes to the back of the throat.
Holy cow.
So we're just gonna scoop out some of his brains.
Devan yes we are.
Both oh.
Man it's just dripping, it's all gloopy.
That's some good stuff.
I'm gonna take an ear right here, look at that.
Oh that's kinda cool, okay.
And then i'm gonna take one of these bolts.
You know what, you've got a bolt,
I'm gonna try get some of this eye here,
Let's just scoop in here like this.
All right boom yeah, here we go,
We've got an eye on top of it all.
Should i go for his nose do you think.
Go for it devan, it's very rare you get to eat a monster.
I gotta say, there was a lot.
Of elements that went in to making this,
Like first of all, that is the most amount.
Of sodium alginate, poured in the calcium lactate.
That i have ever seen.
Devan and the brain was the best.
Collins i know and when you popped it too.
I can't wait to see how the popping boba tastes as well,
I wonder if it's gonna be different than the other stuff.
Both all right here we go,
Three, two, oh hold on.
We just launched some brand new merch.
So if you click the top link in the description right now,
We've got a whole bunch of crazy new designs.
So get yours before it all sells out,
Click that link right now and lets se how this tastes.
Both three, two, one.
That is terrible. - that is so bad.
But i kind of admit it's.
Probably what brains would taste like.
For realism, your monster gets an a+,
But in terms of taste, worst thing we've tasted yet.
Devan it's so bad.
Collins now it's time to taste my pennywise,
And i really hope, it tastes better than yours.
The first thing we're gonna do is break open.
The forehead devan, it's very domesque.
Sorry pennywise.
Oh.
That's a hard head.
He's resilient okay hold on.
He's wearing a hard hat.
Holy cow.
Devan that is harder than i expected.
Actually really this is disturbing.
Is it working, is it working.
Both oh.
In my eyes.
In my eyes.
Oh my gosh, it's the entire ambrosia salad.
Devan he's like ten time more disturbing.
Than he was before.
Oh my goodness.
Yeah, i did not pop the head off enough.
Devan what have you done.
Collins i'm sorry.
Devan this is terrifying.
Collins now it's time to see how.
The inside of pennywise's head tastes,
Just remember devan , it's vegan.
We did a whole bunch of crazy stuff,
I smashed a pineapple with liquid nitrogen,
And a yeet hammer.
That was a first, we've never done that before,
We then made some delicious whipped juice full,
That is probably going to be.
The best tasting part of this whole thing,
And of course, we cannot forget the pretzel in the balloon.
Can i take more of him.
I wanna take off like the ears.
Collins yeah you might wanna take off.
A little bit of the hair over here.
All right here we go.
Both three, two, one, oh wait.
