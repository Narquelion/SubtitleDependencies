Alright, three, two, one.
But not really.
Yes.
This is the one i got last time.
What even are these.
Ugh, the sardines.
I hate sardines, i hate 'em.
Like i really don't like sardines at all.
I've had them dumped on me, i've had them.
Blended up in a smoothie.
This looks like a turd and fish.
I've had them shoved in my mouth.
Fish smells so bad.
Ugh, these are horrible.

Ugh, they're not even gutted.
Dad, you didn't even gut 'em dude.
Oh, it split down the middle.

Let's go to another one.
And that's why you never let an 800.
Pound gorilla give you a bowl cut.
Alright, so next round.

Sorry, that beginning was so stupid.
Three, two, one.
Hey, yo, it's just a burger.
Oh.
That looks awesome.
Boy in white shirt it looks like a crabby patty.
Devan it really does.
Can i pull it apart.
Bro.
So i say we do this.
We're gonna make a burger commercial ourselves.
You turn that way, i'll turn this way.
And we can do our sexy like bite into the burger.
Three, two, hit the music, one.
My mouth is--.
What happened to you.
I don't know.
I don't know.
That was not supposed to happen.
That was good.
My mouth is stuck.
Whatever you guys suggested for this one smells nasty.
Ugh.
After this round one of us is going to be.
Eating a real frog, but first, time to find out.
What is underneath here, and i gotta say,
It smells pretty nasty.
Devan, your turn, do you want to switch 'em or keep 'em.
Well it smells incredibly nasty on my side.
So i think i'm gonna switch 'em.
Oh no.
Well i guess we're gonna go this way.
You ready, three, please, two, one.
Yeah.
Yes, bro, yes.
Boy in white shirt they're chicken feet.
Devan oh.
They're like walking in a line, like little chicken feet.
These are like chicken in a can.
This does not sound good so i'm gonna be very civilized.
Oh, i feel bad for you.
Did they like strip it.
Ugh.
This is like whatever weird meat that is, that's not cool.
Bon appetit.
Yeah bro, i ain't eating a sausage fam.
And like out of a can, that's just weird.
I'm gonna opt for the chicken feet meat.
Okay, i guess devan reffed, eww, eww.
Ah, it melts in your mouth but not in a good way.
That smells so gross.
Can i get food poisoning from chicken feet.
You might be able to.
Dude, let's just move on.

Oh no, no you guys, no, next round.
Okay you guys, let's go to the next round.
