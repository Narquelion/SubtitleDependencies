What's up.
It's collins key and welcome.
To the second annual pie eating contest.
I started this last year during thanksgiving time.
And basically, how this contest works is i have.
To eat a pie in one minute.
So last year i ate this kind of pie,
Which was massive and there was no way.
That i could eat it in a minute.
And so this year, i've got a slightly smaller pie.
That gun sucks.
You blame it on the gun.
So this year i have to eat this pie in the one minute time.
And for those of you guys who are wondering.
Why devan's here, besides trying to shoot me with nerfball.
Basically, devan's only job is to make sure.
That i don't eat this pie in one minute.
So he's gonna do everything he possibly can.
To distract me from eating this.
So we're gonna give this a shot.
And whoever loses this is gonna get smack cammed.
By the other person with a handful of whipped cream.
So make sure you guys watch until the end to see.
How this whole thing turns out and yeah, let's get into it.
Alright, so we have one minute.
Here is the pie.
Devan,
Okay, great.
We're gonna get a little bit of whip on there first.
That was not smooth at all.
Three, two, one.
Okay, so you know this round.
You didn't say begin.
I have to say begin.
Yeah, go.
Alright, begin.
Okay, so this round i'm not even actually worried.
Because my strategy this year, as opposed to hitting him.
In the eye a ton,
I'm actually just gonna add a bunch of volume.
To his meal, so--.
I'm already halfway done, dude.
I actually added a ton of grapefruits.
And of course, some lifesavers.
So enjoy that. - what.
And now, to hit him in the face.
Ow.
Try another one, oh.
And the socks attack.
Oh, snap, get him.
There's no way you're gonna do it.
Tape those ears around.
Oh.
Well, the competition is over and the results are in.
And it looks as though devan won--.
Again. - that's what.
I'm talking about. - i don't know.
How it happened.
I don't know how it happened-- - i do.
But-- - i'm just a beast.
At doing this, man.
I'm really good.
Okay, ow.
It's like on my hair, okay.
It's time i guess for devan to smack cam me,
So if i can just get out of this stuff.
That actually hurts my hair, hold up.
Oh god, ow.
Dude, why'd you put it like all in my hair.
Okay, hold up.
I've untaped myself--.
I missed.
I just have to do it again.
What was that, bro.
No.
That doesn't work.
Not smart.
My ear again.
No.
My eye.
Bro, you're crazy.
