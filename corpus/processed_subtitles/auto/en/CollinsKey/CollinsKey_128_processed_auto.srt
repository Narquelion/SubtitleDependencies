We're kicking off right now.
With the most requested one and that is, yeet.
It's a me, mario.
Oh. - let's go.
Yeah.
I'm going for the arm first,
Because no one ever does that.
Okay, boom.
We got the blue.

Now i got the full body, oh my gosh.
My dude's starting to look more.
Like spongebob than he is mario.
I'm making spongebob.
I got buttons.
Button.
Button.
You're only on the little face, bro.
Bro, he looks like wario.
What, no, whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
And now, for the mouth.
It might blend in with his mustache,
But we're going with it.
I'm even gonna add so many details,
He's gonna have little knuckles.
Where'd my spatula go.
Yeet.
Oh okay cool, i'll be right back.
.
The flip of mario.
I didn't know my voice actually could go that high.
How high can my voice go.
What.
Ow.
It's-a me, mario.
It's-a me, mario.
Bro, what are you doing.
I need to flip my pancake.
No. you're interrupting me.
You're interrupting my flip.
Alright, here's comes the flip.
Three, two, one.
Oh.
His arm flew off.
Yeah but look at that face.
Yo, i think i might have taken the win on this one.
Where did my arm go.
Bro, look at those knuckles.
Oh dear.
I'm not excited for this one.
I think this might be the worst one i've ever made.
Alright, three, two, one.
Oh no. i ripped off his leg.
Well you ripped off his leg and his arm.
I only lost an arm, so i basically won.
Because i got one more limb.

If you guys didn't know,
That's for winner, winner, chicken dinner.
I think my bb-8 quite honestly is almost done.
The only last thing to do is just --.
Oh man, this is getting tricky in these little parts here.
Ahh.

To pull this whole thing off.
I believe in you, collins.
The force is with you.
Thank you.
What are you saying.
Ah. did it.
So i'm gonna do a little kylo ren,
And then last but not least.
You can't forget the iconic saber.
There we go, boom.
Kylo ren.
Time to flip bb-8.
Three, two, one.
Oh snap, it looks like a burnt egg.
Whoa, dude. what.
Alright and now for the one of course.
You've all been waiting for, kylo ren.
Alright, let's see if i can get, oh my gosh,
His little light, his little saber.
Kylo ren's very powerful,
And therefore he's gonna have a very powerful flip.
Three, two, one.
Oh, he's hot.
There's stuff on the ceiling now, bro.
Oh.
Alright it's time for the final part,
And that is adding the white.
This is gonna be the flip of the millennium falcon.

I was adding like, little sesame seeds.
I thought that's what you were doing but i wasn't sure.
I forgot that sesame seeds,
Well, they have black sesame seeds, right.
Next up, i'm doing some lettuce.
Bro, my lettuce is starting to look more like a starfish.
Bro, what are you doing.
Cheese is orange.
Not my swiss cheese.
What the heck, is that face on your tomato.
Just a tomato.
Pickle.
And then one little baby pickle.
Alright guys now the most important thing about a burger,

It looks like mold but it's actually chocolate chips.
Wait, really.
Yeah, i got a chocolate chip bun, patented.

It's a stem down the middle.
You know how lettuce has that stem down the middle.
You know what, creative points.
You got the base, you're gonna wanna.
Pop your let-tass on top.
You gotta put the burger here,
And then you got the cheese directly over the burger.
That actually turned out pretty good.

I like that, swooshy hair.
I messed up the swoosh.
I messed up real bad.
