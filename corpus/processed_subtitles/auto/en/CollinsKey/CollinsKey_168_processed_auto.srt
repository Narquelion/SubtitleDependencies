What's up.
It's collins key, and welcome to the thursday vlog,
And for today's video,
I'm gonna do something that i haven't done.
On this channel in, it's been about a year.
You guys really enjoyed the last one i did,
So today, i'm going to be doing.
A brand new truth or dare video.
I had you guys tweet in a whole bunch of truths,
A whole bunch of dares,
And also, you might be featured at the end of this video.
Like, your picture on the screen.
So make sure you guys stick around 'til the very end.
Without further ado, let's jump into these truths and dares.
"do a standing back flip.".
Hopefully, i don't break my neck, but let's give it a shot.
Oh, snap.
That just happened.
"have you dated a girl before.".
I think it all depends on your definition of dating.
Because when i was 12, i "dated" a girl,
But most we ever did was, we talked on the phone,
And i hugged her one time, which was pretty serious,
And so, i don't know if that's considered "dating" or not.
"do you ever wear tank tops.".
Definitely, all the time.
"i've watched you for two years,
And i dare you to do a smack cam.".
Under normal circumstances, i would not do a smack cam,
But because you've been supporting me for two years,
I love you, so, smack cam, here we go right now.
Alright guys, smack cam.
Ah.
"do you have a crush.".
Low key. right now, i do actually have a crush on someone,
And i don't wanna say who it is,
Because it'll make things kinda awkward.
I'm a magician, okay.
I'm good at keeping secrets.
"put devan in this video.".
Let me see what i can do.
Hello, bye.  - and there're your dose.
Of devan for the video.
"would you ever date a fan.".
Yeah, absolutely, why not.
So, if you're watching this right now,
Me and you, we can be relationship goals.
Yeah, next question.
Jesus christ, holy mary.
"send an ugly selfie to the last person you texted.".
Alright, here we go.
Alright, i'm sending that to gabriel from vine, and send.
"take three bites of an onion.".
Here we go.
I am done. done with that onion.
"for you, what is the most beautiful thing about a girl.".
Well, right off the bat, there's a couple things.
That stand out to me.
One is when a girl has a really pretty smile.
I'm instantly attracted to her.
When a girl has pretty eyes.
I would say the most beautiful thing is.
An amazing personality.
That is the most attractive thing to me.
"have you ever kissed another youtuber.".
Nope.
"shower with your clothes on, or no shirt.".
Alright guys, here's the fully clothed shower,
And to make this even more fun,
I'm gonna go on super cold water.
So yeah, let's go.
Yup, there you go, hope you guys are enjoying this.
Yup, this is a great time. so cold.
Alright guys, i gotta take a shower, bye.
"when are you planning on getting married.".
I don't have a set age of like,
At this age i wanna get married,
But it more has to do with the girl.
When i find the right girl,
I think that'll be the right age.
"if you could make up a law, what would it be.".
Law number one, every one must cover their mouth.
When they cough or sneeze.
"how much money have you spent on eggs.".
Most i've spent on eggs, for a video, was the glozell video,
Because those ostrich eggs,
They were $50 dollars a piece.
And i had seven or eight of them.
But, if you really look at it,
An ostrich egg is $50 dollars,
Cracking it on glozell's head.
Priceless.
"i dare you to eat a pickle covered in marshmallow fluff.
While doing the whip.".
Alright, so i've got the pickle.
And i've got the marshmallow stuff, so yeah,
I'm just gonna dip it in here like this. i guess here we go.
Ehh.
So gross.
"tell us some embarrassing moments you've had.
Trying to impress people.".
Honestly, the amount of embarrassing moments i've had.
Trying to impress people could fill an entire book.
One that happened actually very recently is,
I was on the flight back from playlist live dc,
There was a very pretty youtuber,
She was sitting a row behind me,
And i was sittin' all the way on the window seat,
And i had to get up and use the restroom.
I was like, oh, i'll impress her.
I'll hop up on the seats and walk on the seats.
And get up into the aisle,
As opposed to just walking out like a normal person.
And so i jumped up on the seats.
And then the cushions on the seats slid out,
So i fell over the row in front of me,
Hit this guy in the head,
And everyone laughed, and, oh my gosh.
#thestruggleisreal.
"if you could kiss any youtube girl, who would it be.".
Actually, i wanna get you guys' opinion on this.
So, comment down below what youtuber you'd ship me with.
You never know, it could actually happen.
"what's your middle name.".
What's my middle name.
It's still joseph, still joseph. swag.
So, yeah, my middle name is joseph. swag.
"would you consider your keypers friends,
Or even closer to family.".
You guys are definitely my family, without a doubt.
The keyper family, when i say the keyper family,
I really mean that you guys are my family.
You guys are just the most amazing family.
I could ever ask for.
"truth, do you like pickles.".
I guess, yeah, they're okay.
"i dare you to drink a jar of pickle juice.".
Awesome. alright, well let's do it.
So, i could just drink it out of a glass,
And be a normal, boring person,
But brought along this jar, so, cheers.
Let's try again.
Oh, it went up my nose.
Yeah, there's no way. sorry guys. i tried.
I really tried.
