It looks like a real rat.
Oh but wait, where's the remote at.
That sounded so bad.
Geeze alright here it is, hold on.

Yeah, yeah, of course. - alight cool, i'm gonna-.
Ugh.

I'm gonna go for the head.
It tastes weird.
I don't know how to describe it.
What the hey.
It's not good.
Ew, like almost like has.
A sewer rat taste to it.
Like i don't know what that tastes like.
But it just tastes like that.
It's weird.
I wonder if that like actually has rat in it.
Well,the pickle had pickle juice in it so.
I got to spit it out.
Oh yeah we gotta go spit it out.
Oh my god.
For this round devon you can either.
Keep em or switch em,
So what do you wanna do right now.
I wanna make the decision of keeping it.
Positive.
Yeah sure, yeah.
Alright here we go. - both three two one.
I think it's gonna break the plate.
I thought the whole table broke.
Dude. they're little tiny little brains.
Devon whoa. dude, that's a massive brain.
Yo, this is perfect we can use this as.
Like a loaf of bread for the sandwich.
Ooooh.
Just cut it in half.
But you can cut it in half.
That's a great idea.
We're gonna be eating.
The largest gummy sandwich.
In the entire world at the end of this video,
So make sure you stick around for that.
We'll i'm excited.
I wanna try one of these.
But that's my gummy.
I missed anyway.
That's my gummy.
Bro is it good.
Dude like i think i'm getting smarter.
Because of these. it's so delicious.
Alright so before we cut it in half,
I am actually gonna get it off the plate.
Holy cow.
And then i'm gonna eat--.
What are you doing.
Trying to balance on my nose.
Oooh.
It's so good.
It tastes like cherry.
It doesn't taste like a brain at all,
Not that i'd know what a brain tastes like.
Whoops.
How is that going over there.
Not good.
I can balance on my forehead.
I'm a little unicorn.
Bro, how are we gonna cut it.
Oh man.
How we gonna cut it.
If you do this at home please be careful.
You should not do that.
Parental supervision this is.
Not a smart idea.
Oh my gosh.
Holy cow. - bro what are you doing.
I'm nervous.
Why are you doing this.
It's so difficult.
Look it didn't even make it.
All the way through yet.
This is so difficult man.
Okay i gotta say - be careful.
As an idea for a loaf of bread,
Not the smartest.
We couldn't figure out how.
To cut this thing in half.
But luckily somehow our dad cracked.
The math on the whole thing.
Yeah how did he do it.
Now we have two separate halves.
So this is going to be the bread.
And the first ingredient is the gummy rat.
This is a good kind of base here.
Ugh. i would say it didn't have to be added.
Ew, ew that's so gross.
And then we'll kinda add.
Little gummy brains in there.
Nice.
And we are making the largest gummy sandwich.
In the entire world.
With all these different foods.
Perhaps the only gummy sandwich.
This is probably gonna.
Be the most delicious sandwich of all time.
I am like could not be more excited.
Where does this go. boop.
Right over there.
Move that off to the side.
We're popping this over there.
Yeah. - no.
You can not do that. - yeah.
This is a glass bowl.
That is a wood floor.
I can't wait to see.
What other ingredients we get.
To put on our gummy sandwich.
Hopefully none of them are gross.
But right now lets go to the next one.
Alright collin it is your turn,
