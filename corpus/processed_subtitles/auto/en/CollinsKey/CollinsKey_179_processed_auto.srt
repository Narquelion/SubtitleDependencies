And welcome to the thursday vlog.
And also happy st. patrick's day.
Turn up, we're gonna have a great time today,
And to join me, i have a very special guest.
All the way from ireland,
I have captured a little leprechaun,
His name is devan, yeah.
I wasn't sure, you just said his name was devan,
I was like "that's not a hype intro.".
It's devan.
Yeah, what's up.
Welcome, my little leprechaun buddy.
For today's video, in honor of st. patrick's day,
We are going to be doing our very own.
St. patrick's day challenge, and we really want to test.
Our knowledge, go head to head right now.
And see who knows more,
I know nothing.
Yeah, i really don't know that much.
About st. patrick's day.
So we're gonna see how this goes,
And basically how it's gonna go.
Is we have a third party  my dad.
And he went up and he looked up.
A whole bunch of different st. patrick's day.
Trivia and questions and he's gonna be reading them off.
And whoever answers it first correctly,
That person is awarded one point.
And the loser has to do a punishment.
And we have our little punishment bucket right here.
With these little scrolls inside,
Which is kind of cool.
So you have to pick one out at random.
And you have to do whatever is on the scroll.

.
Do leprechauns get angry,
He said leprechauns, we got leprechauns.
Do they get what, do they get what.
I'm crying, do leprechauns get what.
Do it again.
No no, what's the questions.
Dad do leprechauns get angry.
When you make fun of their height.
Both yes.
No.
I don't know. - they get happy.
I've never met a leprechaun.
A little bit.
I don't know.
Dad it's actually only a little bit.
That's so stupid.
So i just got a point now, so devan,
You have to remove from the leprechaun pail of not-gold.
Just get something out of there and let's see what it is.
Eat as many gold coins as you can in one minute.
Three, two, one, go.
Ow.
Ow. what hurt.
Are you okay.
What just happened.
Dude, you're running out, man, what are you doing.
He's so ticklish.
It's so gross.
Dad what is a shillelagh.
Is it like a,
.
Oh, okay.
Dad there's four choices.
I know, what are they.
 a big stick.
 a four leaf clover.
 a pot belly pig.
 a mode of transportation.
I think it's a big stick.
I think it's d.
Final answer, big stick.
Is it.
It's a big stick.
I was totally joking.
Pick out your punishment, dude.
Alright.
Get pinched in the cheeks, aw.
By me.
Bro, chill.
Oh my god, you were way too ready for that.
Oh my god, dude.
There was no hesitation.
You saw that, you were like "this can only mean one thing.".
Alright, here we go.
Boop, boop, and then,
Alright, and then stand up, you asked for it, bro.
I did not ask.
You did, you literally stood up.
And put it right in my face dude.
If you want to do it, i mean go for it.
Now you're making this really awkward, bro.
I don't necessarily,
I don't either, man, it's up to you.
This is so bad.
We're flipping a chocolate coin to find out.
Whether or not i'm gonna pinch his butt.
That's the easy way out. - what do you want.
That's the easy way out.
Heads or tails, which one's your butt, heads or tails.
Tails. - tails is butt, of course.
Flip it.
Heads, so i don't have to pinch your butt, congratulations.
Oh thank goodness.
Yep, okay, that was close.
Alright, so let's go, next question.
Dad the official emblem of ireland is.
There's four choices.
 the shamrock.
 the harp.
 the barley stone.
 the leprechaun.
The lepre, no, no, stop, i know it's not, sorry.
The shamrock.
No it's not, it's the barley, the sharley, the darley.
I'm going with a, whatever a was.
C, what c, i'm going with answer number c.
Dad a is the shamrock.
Yes. - dad wrong.
What. - what.
C is the barley stone.
Woman blarney. - dad blarney.
Blarney. - dad the blarney stone.
Wrong.
Oh, what was it, was it the leprechaun.
Dad it's between the leprechaun and the harp.
It's gotta be the harp, it's the harp,
It's gotta be the harp.
Leprechaun's just kind of weird.
It's gotta be the harp, it is not the expected answer.
What is it.
Dad it's the harp.
Whatever this is, we'll do it together.
We'll both take the punishment.
Cause we didn't know what it was.
Peel a potato as fast as possible.
So that was the initial punishment.
But since we're gonna be doing this,
We're gonna take the challenge up to another level.
So what's gonna happen,
We each have our own peelers right here.
Woah, woah, woah.
Yours is smaller. - oh yeah, nevermind.
I'm trying to give you somewhat of an advantage here.
Here's what's gonna happen, we have to peel our potatoes.
As fast as possible, whoever peels the full potato first,
That person wins and the loser has to take a bite.
Out of their fully peeled potato.
Begin.
I feel like i could cut my fingers off.
You're on the table, that's very smart,
You're very intelligent, devan, the way you did that.
Oh thank you.
Oh three, two. - no no no no.
Peeled, i'm done, yes.
No, i had like two little bits.
I had like two little bits left.
Alright, here we go, take a bite of my potato.
What.
Take a bite out of it, don't swallow the whole thing.
It was stuck, it was stuck in my teeth,
I have to dental floss after this.
It doesn't taste good. - no, it's a raw potato, dude.
Wait, you didn't say i have to chew it.
That didn't work.
Dad when is an irish potato not an irish potato.
When it's in devan's mouth. - when it's a seed.
When it's not in ireland.
Oh, when it's an american potato.
When it's a french fry.
Is that right.
That is so stupid.
Eat an entire bowl of lucky charms in under one minute.
No.
And you know what devan, this a matter of fate.
That you did get this one.
Because you're gonna have to eat it.
Out of the bowl that you spit all your,
We don't have another bowl. - no.
We don't have another bowl. - this is the only bowl.
You're telling me we have only one bowl.
I am telling you we have only one bowl.
In our entire house. - this is it,
This the only bowl in the neighborhood,
Quite even possibly in the town.
Looks like you're gonna have to make do.
With what could be turd or chocolate, you never know.
We've got lucky charms right here.
I am feeling lucky.
You are apparently lucky.
This is how i do my cereal.
Did you see like, what the heck.
You act like you've never poured a bowl of cereal before.
You have one minute to eat this whole thing.
Oh i have, the whole thing.
Did you not read it.
I kind of glossed over it when i saw i had to eat.
My own chocolate that i already spit out.
Okay, here we go, go.
His mustache has gotten,
The mustache is like right in his mouth.
He's literally eating his mustache, oh my god.
Bro, i don't want to be close to you, take your mustache,
Take it, dude, my god bro, no, stop it.
I just wanted a hug, what the heck.
Oh my god.
No hug.
No, no no.
Dad this is a question.
Okay.
As opposed to an answer.
That is shocking.
Can't believe it.
Dad why can't you borrow money from a leprechaun.
Because they got none.
Because they're too small.
Because they're a little broke.
Because they're a little short at the moment.
They're short.
Alright, drink green water till your tongue is green.
What.
Oh, we have food coloring.
No.
No, it's gonna turn my teeth green.
I'll do this with you, i'll do this with you.
Whoever gets their tongue to turn green first.
Doesn't have to drink the entire thing, go.
What.
Dude, literally,
You just took like the most highly concentrated.
Food coloring in the world and put it directly.
On your tongue.
It's pretty messed up, bro.
The whole thing.
Drink some more.
Woah, hey.
You gotta drink the whole thing, bro.
I know. - i ain't playing around.
Obviously.
Oh, what.
That's in my freaking eye.
No.
Why. i'm freezing.
No, what, you had to drink it, you can't do that,
You had to drink it.
Fine, fine.
What. - i drank it all.
That wasn't,
Chill, bro.
Alright, next question, let's do it,
Let's wrap this thing up.
Dad what do you call a fake stone in ireland.
Shamrock.
Yes, i got one.
Yes.
Choose it.
It says speak in an irish accent.
Okay, that's a punishment, really.
I guess.
I won one so he would have to do that.
Dad wait, here's one.
May the dust of your carriage wheels.
Blind the eyes of your foes.
I like that one.
Eat all my lucky charms there boy.
It's like a pirate.
May the dust of your,
It's a pirate.
An irish pirate.
May the dust of your carriage.
Kick them in the enemy of your eyes.
The eyes of the enemy.
That's not even right.
Make up your flaming mind.
Make up your flamer.
May i keep flaming till the day i die.
What's this.
It's the irish, the luck of the irish.
It's my shamrock.
It's my bloody shamrock necklace.
Look at your shamrock hat, you shamrock fool.
This isn't a punishment, this is awesome.
Sorry, i got a little bit too lit there, boy.
Well that wasn't a punishment.
