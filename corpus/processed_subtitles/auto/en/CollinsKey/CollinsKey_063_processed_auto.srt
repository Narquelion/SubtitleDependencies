So without further ado,
Collins key .
Oh.
What's up, bro.
I'm not gonna edit that.
You're gonna look as stupid as it looks in real life.
Hey.
Today's video, we're going to be doing a challenge.
This one is called the questions only challenge.
And i thought on the tv show.
Called who's line is it anyway.
And how the challenge works.
Is we have to have an entire conversation.
Asking only questions,
And whoever messes-up.
Or uses a statement or something,
They automatically lose that round.
There are three rounds,
Whoever wins the majority of those rounds.
Gets to tweet something inappropriate off.
Of the loser's twitter account.
Okay.
Okay, so at the end of the video,
I'll put whatever the screenshot of that tweet is,
So make sure you guys stick around to the end.
To see what that inappropriate tweet is.
And without further ado,
Let's just jump right into.
Dive right into.
Just dive into this.
We're diving into this challenge.
Whoa, sharks.
Just diving each way,
Just diving.
Are you ready.
Yeah.  all right.
Oh.
No, dude, it did not start yet.
It did not start yet.
For those of you guys who don't know what just happened,
He used a question and i did not.
We did not start.
Round one did not commence yet.
Round one is gonna be really easy,
We're just gonna have a regular conversation.
So round one, begin.
Are you ready.
Are you ready.
Does it look like i'm ready.
Your eyebrows look kind of.
Oh my god. did i lose the first.
I went down in an eyebrow joke.
Oh no.
Turn it up, turn it up.
I can't believe i lost that fast. okay.
I'm so bad at this game too.
I know.
Round one, devan is the winner.
Okay. how the heck did that happen.
Round two is actually a little bit harder.
We're just gonna do random questions as fast-.
As fast as-.
As fast as possible.
Begin.
What's up dog.
You see that.
Oh man. what's up greg.
What's up. is this as challenging as family.
Is that a high jump.
Why are we jumping even in the first place.
Is my head completely out of the frame.
I don't think.
Darn it i lost.
Yeah. woo.
Pretty nice, party dance, pretty nice.
Why are we yelling.
Round three.
This is the determining round,
Whoever wins this one.
Gets to tweet something inappropriate.
Off of the loser's account.
Oh snap.
So this is a big one,
And this round is all about relationships,
And go.
Have you been in a relationship.
Do you have a girlfriend.
Why do you wanna know my personal life.
When was your first kiss.
Why don't we talk about you.
Why not.
