This is unprecedented for a video,
So first of all i want to please welcome,
All the way from his bedroom right now,
My little brother, devan key.

There we go.
Devan needs to work on his.
Teleportation skills, - yes.
Just a little bit.
So, for today's video, we are going to be tasting.
A whole bunch of super, super sour candy.
But we thought, you know what.
If we just do a whole bunch of sour candy,
The entire time, that's no fun.
Because it's going to be a whole bunch of.
What we thought we'd do, we would break it up, do.
Super sweet candy in between the sour candy.
So that way our taste buds.
Are in complete confusion the entire time.
Now, since this candy is so sour,
It's going to be extremely painful,
So please give this video a big thumbs up.
For some encouragement because.
I don't want to be in pain.
So yeah, if you guys give.
Wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on.
We're gonna be in pain.
Yeah.
I think so. - you're telling me.
I came all the way from michigan.
I can't make you go back now.
You saw how bad i did on the way here.
Yeah, you're right, you've just got to do it, bro.
You can give me a little heads up next time.
Alright, cool, will do.
If this video gets enough thumbs up, you know what.
We might make him teleport.
All the way back from michigan and do another video.
So yeah, make sure you give this video a big thumbs up.

So, whoever can blow a bubble first, wins.
And the two losers have to do one more.
Of these really crazy lemon ones we just did.
Ooooh.

And then i'll post that picture here on the screen,
That way you guys can see what it is.
If you guys haven't already added me on snapchat,
You might as well do that right now.
If you thought that one was bad,
You should seriously see mine.
What's yours.
Look at this.
What.
I'm going to take a picture on my snapchat.
If you guys don't have devan on snapchat,
You might as well add him right now.
Alright, i'm gonna like pop it inside out.
It's like an oyster, right.
Oh, you're right; an oyster.
Okay, the oyster.
Three, two, one.
Mmm.
Wow.
Mmm.
That's pretty good.
That was really good.
Wow, that is good.
That was delicious.
I like this one, very good.
This next one i do not know what these things are.
They are something warhead.
Hey, it actually looks like this red thing could be sweet.
Yeah, i guess you're right.
Yeah.
So this is - i'm hoping.
I guess, ow.
Oooh.
First of all, you must lick the red thing.
Dip it in.
Oh, okay.
Oh my gosh.
Three, two, one.
Ha.
Ooh.
It's lit.
Alright, i'm gonna go for it again.
It's on my lips.
Hoooo-oooh.
I'm doing another one.
Ho.
Yeah, i just inhaled it.
We're doing one more guys, you ready.
Wait, we're all doing it.
Ha.
This is a choking hazard.
I hurt my lips.
My lips are burning - ha.
Ooooh.
It's hot.
It's hot.
I'm sweating.
Dude, your teeth are all green.
Yours are too.
Am i.
Alright, next one, let's go.
After that horrible experience,
We're gonna eat some pina colada cotton candy.
Take a pinch each.
A pinch.
Alright take it.
Alright, here we go.
Hm.
I love cotton candy.
It just like dissolves in your mouth.
It's not bad.
I don't like this flavor, though.
Cotton candy is cotton candy, bro.
Here, you want some more. - yeah.
Here, want some more.
That's adorable.
Back to the sour - no.
With this blue stuff.
Sour punch straws.
Alright, here we go, you ready.
Three, two, one.
Oh, that's sour.
Ahhhhh my word. - woah.
Oh it's sour.
Alright, so our reward now - oooh.
Is pop rocks.
Oh sweet. i've done these like.
One other time. - so.
Three, two, one, go.
God.
Still popping.
It's not even in my mouth.
It's in my throat.
They're popping in your throat.
We're just gonna be popping for a little bit now.
I can feel it right there.
That is so funny.
Alright, cool, so let's try the next sour one.
Next up, we have toxic waste.
Toxic waste.
I actually have prior experience with these.
I did a video with mel and - wait, really.
These were also involved, so how were they.
They were great.
Three, two, one, go.
No.
Oh.
Oh.
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo.
Oh my god.
It hurts so bad.
Oh.
These are way, way worse than i remember.
This one doesn't get sweet.
Mom.
It keeps going.
Okay.
It finally got sweet.
It really wouldn't.
Little devan is in pain.
Are you okay.
I'm all sweating, so much.
You know what, all my like water ducts are full.
Your water yucks.
These are horrible.
The worst ones yet.
We gonna need some sweetness to compensate for that one.
And you're literally crying.
I am.
Oh.
And these are called macaroons, i believe,
So they are blueberry ones.
Macaroons.
Macaroons.
Take a macaroon.
Oh wait.
I got you, devan, don't worry.
Three, two, - i'm popping the whole thing.
Yep.
Mmm.
Wow.
It is really good.
It is so soft.
It's like eating cloud.
Yeah.
Alright, so we're gonna try these ones,
Which literally look like organs.
I'm not even kidding.
Cheers.
These look really weird.
They remind me of something body-ish, but i don't know.
Eat it.
Ha.
Woo.
Ew.
It actually got better.
Just a little bit.
I touched my tongue to my lips.
Hoo.
These are just little licorices,
Which should be delicious, so.
I hope they're sweet.
Yeah.
Ah.
Oh.
These are good. - very yummy.
These are yummy. - yeah.
I like these a lot.
I dig these a lot.
These are really delicious.
Let's get more of these.
So these are called sour twists.
Nooooo they're made by warhead.
I'm not excited about this.
At all.
It smells wrong.
Oh, singed my nose hairs.
Dude, such babies.
Two at once.
Woah, chillax bra.
Fine, i'll take.
Five.
Handful, bras.
Well, yeah, you can't.
Come at me.
You're anteing up for me.
I give up.
Yeah, you can have the rest.
Three, - this is it.
Why are we doing this.
I don't know, go.
Two, i wanted to do one.
Okay.
That was nothing.
There's no  at all.
Hit me again, bro.
I can do another handful of these.
Right.
These ones are rather clever because they look like.
Little raspberries and blackberries but apparently.
They're supposed to be sour.
So you're gonna toss it up and then catch it in our mouths.
Three, two, one, go.
Ow.
Three, two, one, go.
Ayup.
These aren't gummy at all.
These are awesome.
Wow, these are really good.
Or really tasty.
They were supposed to be sour, but they.
Are the most delicious ones.
The most delicious.
The most delicious.
Okay, so these are not honey sticks,
These are chocolate.
Brothers sweet.
Honeysticks.
How do we open them.
Just bite it.
It's gonna explode.
Oh, hey it opened.
Mm.
Do they taste good.
Not my favorite but, okay.
I don't think i like it that much.
Eh.
Eh.
Uh-uh, i don't like it.
Well, i got a taste of it.
Yours isn't even open yet.
Yeah, i'm struggling.
Oh man.
Alright, you ready.
Mm-hm.
Oh, it's weird.
It's so strange.
Yo, i can't get enough of that.
So this one here is called cry baby tears.
Extra sour candy.
If they're more sour than the toxic waste ones,
I'm scared for my life.
They're like made in the shape of tears, as well.
That's how bad these things are.
Oh gosh. you cry on this one,
You the cry baby. - i'm fumbling.
Three, two, one.
Oh, man.
Don't you cry baby.
Hold it back devan.
You're on camera.
Be a man.
Or a line about the cry baby.
There he is.
This one right here, is fish of some sort.
Starfish.
Starfish.
They're just stars.
I don't know why they assume they're starfish.
Please be sweet.
Please be sweet.
Yeah, these are sweet ones.
Wait,
Oh no, i dropped it - oh no.
No, in the trash.
Oh, pick it up.
It got a little bit dirty.
Oh god, it got really dirty.
Augh.
I'm gonna eat it anyway.
I can't taste anything.
It tastes terrible.
I've got a super sour one.
I literally can't taste anything right now.
Oh, really are you not.
It's sour.
Oh.
Why. - no.
Tastes like salt.
I . it tastes like tar.
It's stuck to my mouth.
It's stuck to my mouth.
This is the worst.
Tastes like i'm eating dirt,
Salty dirt.
It was supposed to be good.
Ew.
I'm gonna throw up.
Please give this video a big thumbs up.
For the fact that we ate some of the most sour candy.
Yup.
And we were in some serious pain,
Yeah, that was intense.
Any thumbs up would be much appreciated.
Go check out them both,
I'm gonna put both their social media links.
Down in the description below, go follow them.
So go do it.
Right now i'm gonna eat - can we eat now.
Yeah, i would eat the whole thing.
Bye.
Hold on, now let's make him teleport home.
Alright there we go, and you gotta go.
Bye-bye. - wait, what.
Bam.
I'm all alone.
