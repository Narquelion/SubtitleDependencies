She's like this is so great.

Agh.
That's a throw-up.
That's absolutely ridiculous.
Oh my god oh my god.

I literally had to avert my eyes.
It just kept on going.
Yeah.
That was a lot of contents,
He had a lot of stuff in his stomach man,
That's all i can say.
Wow, did he have like 10 sprites or something.
Geez.
I don't know.
I hope that none of you guys are sympathetic thrower-uppers,
Cos that video would have triggered you.
For sure.
I'm like hugging myself right now.
Your whole body just is like.
Full body cringe.
Okay, next clip.
Let's do it.
Oh, but those moves though.
Oh my god, i thought that that fell on his leg.
That would be me while i'm trying to dance.
In the kitchen, i'm not even joking.
Yeah, that wasn't too cringey,
It was just kinda.
Yeah, it was just like a fail video.
My wife kelly is a freaky eater.
A freaky eater.
Is that like--.
Narrator 33 year old kelly eats nothing.
But cheesy potatoes, morning, noon, and night.
I love cheesy potatoes.
No we cannot.
Gooey and just, yum yum yummy.
Each and every day, kelly eats a minimum.
Of eight potatoes and four cups of cheese,
Amounting to a whopping 8000 calories,
And 176 grams of fat a day.
Husband well i want you to try this.
Because it's a green vegetable.
God this is gonna be good.
Tried to cook her a little something extra,
She just refuses.
Aww.
Husband just try a little taste.
Both oh man.
I was about to say they need to put some cheese.
On that vegetable, like maybe some cheese and potatoes.
Yeah, just to disguise it or something.
Wow.
Wow.
Right, well, i think, i low-key wanna try it now,
Cos if she loves it that much,
It must be really delicious.
All being thrown down by jake dub,
As he's now gonna go by.
What a name.
He's definitely been running well.
Two straight tournaments off to a great start.
In this one.
Thanks so much dude, i appreciate it.
Feel like a gangster handshake now,
Show me how it's done in compton.
What was that.
Alright, cool, alright.
Let's just, we're gonna put our heads down in shame.
And walk away from that one.
Bro like, the worst part is i've done that.
I think every guy has had an awkward handshake.
Cos there's so many.
You've got like just the normal handshake.
You've got the, this one.
Like a bro.
You go in for a hug, too, so it could be like.
You're going in for a bro and then your hands.
Get like caught.
And it's awkward.
Hey.
And then you got this, where you get extra fancy,
Like this.
Yeah, like that.
And then some people have like special releases,
Where they go like this, and it's like bom,
And they blow it up.
You gotta blow up.
Or the time when i seem like this.
Where they go, bom, and then they go back to this,
All i'm saying is there's a lot.
Endless variation.
There's endless variations.
So, i think that was pretty bad though.
But that was really funny.

As a businessman and casino owner,
During a speech in atlantic city, new jersey today.
Donald trump.
Donald trump.
There we are.
I don't know what's going on.
I definitely know his political views, that's for sure.
And he went live, on accident, i'm guessing.
Donald trump.
I don't usually bathe,
But when i do,
I use pepsi.
Whoo.
Have you guys seen what pepsi does to your teeth.
What's it doing to your whole body at this point.
Ah, gotta love it.
Gotta love it.
I keep the bathtub lined with pepsi,
Just because you gotta still wait here,
And leaks out a little.
No, i think it's just for aesthetic.
This guy's not a coke guy.
Oh my gosh.
I knew it, i knew he was gonna do it.
That would burn your eyes so bad.
Is the dirtiest part.
Ooh, that angle though.
That angle though.
How'd they get the camera at that angle.
Is the real question.
He's holding it.
He had it in his hand.
I thought another guy crawled in the tub, was like--.
That was my first thought, yeah.
I wish i had those skills, bro.
Yeah.
Was that it.
No, he's back.
Is he gonna do two at once.
No, oh.
What kind of--.
Can't do two at once.
His legs just gave out.
Collin oh there's slow motion.
Both oh.
You know that's bad when you do the head like, bounce off.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Alright, let's move on.
Narrator peter boyle is a tough, ill-mannered cop.
Who has run down a lot of dudes.
But, that's not the end of his story.

He's reincarnated.
Ah.
Surprise.
Narrator as a streetwise bulldog in poochinski.
Oh, no.
Is this a real thing.
Narrator the talking dog teams up.
With his astonished former partner--.
Yeah, i'd be astonished if a dog was my reincar,
Oh no.
It's a guy doing that, that's not a dog.
Nice life.
That dog is on some next level stuff right now.
I'm a cop.

Put that loud.
You got it, daddy.
I like calling you daddy.
Well thank you.
Both hmm.
