I'm leonie.
I'm collins.
I thought you'd given up.
Yeah, after the art show, i thought.
You were messing with me, or maybe this.
Was some giant, elaborate, prank or something.
That's not it.
Actually, i can't believe that i pulled it off.
That you're here, it's crazy.
I wanted to give you something.
What.
An adventure.
I used to be like you, but i was.
Always so determined not to be normal.
Not to fit in.
I spent half my life chasing this, like,
Need to keep trying new things.
To collect experiences.
I spent a year in rome studying architecture.
Worked as a sous-chef on food truck.
Modeled in new york, and of course magic.
Which is how i found you.
But art, photography, that's what stuck.
It made me realize the only thing.
You have, is the moment you're in right now.
A picture isn't real, it's what's.
Left over from something real that happened.
And people see what they want.
When they look at it, it's an illusion.
Just like magic.
You know, for me, magic is real.
Because, growing up i was always a bit of a loner.
Magic was that one thing that i could do.
And i could connect with these people,
And it was like it was just me and them.
And there was nothing else in the entire world mattered.
I was able to make people feel something.
The first time i saw you do.
Magic on tv, you were so honest.
And you cried.
No, no, it was amazing.
I don't think i've ever seen someone.
Want something so badly.
I'd always imagine.
What.
What it would be like to be that.
One thing that you want so badly.
Why now.
Because i'm leaving la.
Wait, what.
I left you all of those messages,
So you could know me, even just.
A little bit, before i asked you.
Before you asked me what.
To come with me.
This week is just the beginning of our adventure.
We can go anywhere, do whatever we.
Want, and just see what happens.
I can't.
Collins, this is what i've been trying.
To tell you, you can do whatever you want.
No i can't just leave it all behind.
Yes, you can, because none of that matters.
The only thing that matters is right here, right now.
Yeah, but that does matter.
It's my life, magic, my fans, my friends, jacob and.
Oh.
I just, i.
I should probably get going.
Yeah, get back to your life, i get it.
What about you, where are you gonna go.
Oh, probably some other city,
To leave clues for some other guy.
I'm just kidding, i don't know.
I'm not sure yet, but i like it that way.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
There he is.
Yeah, hey martin.
My star clown, my magical clown.
I was just at the studio man, they love it man.
They cannot get enough of you.
Collins i don't want to do the show.
Wait, what you talking.
It's just not what i want.
What do you mean it's not what you want.
You don't know what you want, you're like 12.
Martin hello.
Are you serious.
No.
Hey, jacob.
