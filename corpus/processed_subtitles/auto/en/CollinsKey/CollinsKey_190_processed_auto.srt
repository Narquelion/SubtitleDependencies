Yo, i can't believe we are actually doing this.
Oh my gosh.
They have it, this is the exact same one he drew.
No way.
I don't know man, should we buy it.
You challenged us to the you draw it,
I'll buy it challenge, but with a pancake art twist.
We're drawing six expensive luxury items,
And we're kicking it off with our dream tech products,
So let's go.
Devan, i've wanted these things for years,
So i really hope you actually buy it for me.
Wait, what kind of tech is that bro.
If that's the new iphone i'm going to freak out.
Could you imagine that little robot head.
Popping out the top of your phone.
And delivering messages like.
Hey you got to get up for school.
Can you give me a hint, devan.
Can you fit this in your pocket.
No, this could fit you in its pocket.
What.
Yeah.
Devan, how would i actually buy this for you brother.
It's like a giant robot, so how about this,
I'm going to add in an extra element, devan,
This is very important, this extra element has nothing.
To do with the actual product itself, there we go, alright.
Devan it's got to be some sort of face.
Collins yo, that thing is looking insane bro,
There is no taking pictures with this guy.
He can't fit in the selfie.
Oh.
Even with a selfie stick, he couldn't fit in the selfie.
Definitely not.
Collins all right, dude next up here we go.
We're going to add some details in the mind,
These are going to be very important.
He's got loaf of bread eyebrows.
I want to eat those eyebrows.
Hold on guys, this just in, youtube star devan key.
Admits to eating eyebrows.
Yes, this is very bizarre, but he has admitted.
To eating eyebrows, back to you patricia.
Your guy looks pretty aggressive, i've got to say.
He does not look like a friendly guy.
You would want to meet in a dark alley way.
If this doesn't give it away, i don't know what will.
Upside down p.
Are you kidding me, devan.
Dude how am i going to be able to buy that for you.
That's why your pancakes are better than mine bro.
Cause your always in my space, look at your elbow bro,
Devan what.
I have no room to move over here man.
Devan i think you're over exaggerating.
Here a little bit.
I am not. - you have enough space now.
No, okay see. - how about now.
I'm just going to get this little tooth right over here.
Yeah. - i can still make a pancake like this though.
That's actually really impressive.
Look. - collins all right here we go we're going.
To have to fill in these lovely teeth right over here.
Devan wait, dude does that guy have golden teeth.
Collins no, he doesn't brush his teeth.
Yo, yours looks so amazing man.
I am so happy we're not choosing the pancake.
Off of which one looks better,
Because that looks like your best one you've ever made dude.
I'll give you final hint about my guy, devan.
Okay.
He's not a fan of pancakes in the morning,
He's making waffles.
Donkey's not green.
Collins you know who this is.
Devan yeah dude, it's shrek.
Then you've known this whole time this was shrek.
Even though you're mainly using blue,
It's crazy how much depth you're able to achieve with that.
Where would you buy this.
What. did you touch it.
I told you not to get close to it.
I'm sorry.
Devan good thing it was on the chest.
In a part that doesn't really matter.
Are those earmuffs.
Cause if they are why aren't they on his ears.
Yeah i got to think about the anatomy of this.
Devan now it's time to fill in the background.
Before we flip the pancakes it's time.
To find out who buys what.
But if we're going off which pancake looks better,
I've read the comments, and apparently,
You guys don't think i would win.
So we have the coin of destiny.
Each side has one of our faces on it.
So right now it's time to flip the coin.
And whoever's face lands on top, that person wins.
And the other person has to buy whatever they drew.
So let's see who wins.
In unison three. two. one.
Yes i won. whew. - yes, dude.
That's actually probably for the best.
Yo, that is a huge relief bro,
Cause could you imagine if i had to buy you a full blown man.
But right now, it's time to flip the pancakes.
All right, here we go, time for the flip,
So you got to get up underneath it,
In unison oh boy.
Three. two. one.
All right devan, so this right here.
Is what you're going to be buying me.
Dude, i have no clue.
I can't wait to see what yours looks like, man.
Looks like there is a cheese filling around it right now.
Devan time to flip mine.
Collins dude, you are so close.
In unison ready, set, go.
In unison oh. dude.
Devan what.
Collin devan, you're going to have to try to find.
What i drew.
And we'll find out if he does at the end of the video.
You challenged us to make our dream jewelry, so let's go.
I got to be very careful with mine,
Because i really, really, really want this piece of jewelry.
Devan right now i'm adding the diamonds.
And this is what makes mine extremely expensive.
Is that a coffin.
What. no.
Do you want a luxury coffin, devan.
Is that your ideal piece of jewelry.
Yes, but that's not what this is.
Dude, can you imagine a coffin with wheels,
But you roll up to the club,
And then resurrect yourself out of the coffin,
And then at the end of the night, you're dead tired,
So you lay back in your coffin and zoom off.
Oh my gosh, this is coming together man,
This is gonna work.
Devan dude these designs are crazy.
Collins those two last little gems.
Are the most important.
So there's gems on it.
Ye- oh- maybe.
Devan now its time to fill it in.
Collins why does yours look gray now.
It looks pretty scary.
Now if we choose yours, i won't know what it is.
I might think you tried to make a basket, or a coffin.
Devan got to add some blue right here.
Collins boom. and there we go.
Mine is all done. now i just got to let it cook,
And devan are you almost done with yours.
Devan i'm actually almost done.
Collin} that's looking really good for a party coffin.
We're going to be using the coin of destiny.
Each side has one of our faces on it.
So right now, i'm going to flip it,
And whichever side lands face up that's who wins.
So here we go, are you ready.
In unison three. two. one.
Dude, oh my gosh. - what, no.
I don't even know what that is.
Oh dude it is that.
Collins oh it is super expensive.
All right, well here we go, time to flip mine.
Hopefully, the moment it flips over.
You'll know exactly what it is.
In unison three. two. one.
In unison oh.
Devan wait a second.
No.
What.
What.
I moved it and it wrecked it a smidge so here we go,
Hold on, we got to lift it up, oh my gosh.
Devan you did a really good job though.
No.
Devan it looks actually really cool.
Collin pay close attention to what you think.
It could be.
I gotcha.
Dude, this is gonna look insane.
When you actually flip it bro.
Oh.
I can't wait to see what it is,
And i'm very happy i don't have to buy it,
Cause it looks super expensive.
In unison three. two. oh wait.
Three second like challenge.
We want to see if you can like this video in three seconds.
Are you ready.
Here we go,
In unison three, two, one. done.
Ready, set, go.
Collin oh my gosh.
You can comment down below how.
Much money is devan going to spend when he buys this.
And we'll find out at the end of the video.
You challenged us to make our favorite fashion items,
So let's go.
All right, here we go, gonna start out.
With this shape of mine, so we're gonna go here.
Devan i've kind of made it a little far in mine.
Collin and then we go up and then we go over.
And then down like that.
Collin these aren't yeezys devan, they're keezys.
Oh.
Key bro special right here.
Whoa, don't drag me into this dude.
I think i'm going to go for some details now.
Collin and now it's time to fill it in with color.
And this is really where mine starts to comes life man.
This is really going to look amazing.
Really. all right.
Oh abso-flipping-lutely dude.
If you try to buy this thing man it might max out your visa.
I've got a vision in my mind, and it looks good.
Oh, no.
For the liquid man, i gotta dab it up real quick.
See if i can fix it, okay here we go.
Devan oh dude what did you do.
Collin now that i'm looking at it i think it might.
Be a shoe.
But it's a very specific shoe that i'm looking for.
Devan here we go, just gonna add some blue.
Back in over here like this.
Collin a blue heel i've heard is very important.
On a shoe.
From who.
I hear it from all the designers.
Devan, trust me when you go to.
The store you'll know exactly what to buy.
Which store though. that's very general.
Collin i'll have to give you a hint.
For the store somewhere in this.
Does that does not make any sense.
It's like two keys.
No. you know what store this is.
Chanel.
Collin no. in what world is that a c devan.
Devan crocs.
You are not buying me crocs.
Devan well you should know what mine is by now, right.
Collins yeah, it's a robe.
No, no, it's a very specific robe.
Collins oh its a snuggie.
Devan no, it's like five times the price of a snuggie,
Dude.
A snuggie is like 29 bucks.
Maybe, i didn't know how much snuggies were.
How much do you think a snuggie is.
I don't know, like 150 bucks.
Man, what kind of snuggies have you been ripped off by.
Before we flip, it's time to find out who buys what,
So we've got the coin of destiny right now.
Here we go, just gonna give it a flip, three, two, one.
And whichever side lands face up,
The other person has to buy whatever was drawn.
So here we go,
In unison three, two, one.
I won, oh yes. - oh man, i wanted my robe.
You're going to have to buy me these shoes.
Devan it was a versace robe.
Collin what. - devan yeah it was versace.
Yo that would've been super expensive.
All right here we go, time to flip mine man,
And when i reveal it, dude,
I'm hoping this is going to be my best pancake yet.
Three, two, one.
Oh no.
Well the leg, the leg just kind of fell apart.
Dude, i think i nailed the shoe from every level.
Devan yeah man.
All right here we go, here we go, here we go,
Coming underneath, oh yes, all right pull it, pull it.
Pull it, side, side, side, side, side, side.
Team work makes the dream work.
Where.
I thought it was going to be screwed up for sure.
Nice.
Now it's time to flip.
Ready, set, go.
Collins that looks like a very high end snuggie.
It's not a snuggie dude.
Collins you get to comment down below.
What store you think devan will be able to buy this at,
We'll be finding out if he's able.
To find the exact shoe at the end of the video.
You challenged us to make our dream gaming equipment,
So let's go.
To kick mine off i'm starting with a shape,
Wait.
So here we go, so it's going to go up and around like this.
Devan what are you making.
That's not good.
I'm trying to play with perspective on this one,
Get a little bit more artsy.
But it looks like a very sad porpoise man.
This is his tail and his head .
All of his friends swam away with him,
He's like but guys i can't swim as fast.
All right, next up here, time to give my guy some detail.
So this is really where i think it's going to start.
To bring it together-.
Wait your guy, so you're making a guy.
I didn't say that.
Devan do you have any guesses as to what mine is.
Collin i think yours is a man wearing.
Some insane wrist bangles on him, devan.
Could you imagine a guy, like a classical concert,
And everyone's like oh what a beautiful set.
And he's like.
In unison ahh hey hey hey hey.
I love it.
Does he have a piece of lettuce going across his torso.
Devon he does, he just recently went vegan.
Collin i'm going to add some extra elements around it.
Devon okay.
Collin so here we go-.
Two bowling balls.
Alright so next up we are going to use some white-.
Look at that directly to the center of the face.
Oh geez.
It has to do with what this is.
Light saber boy.
Collin  what.
Alright i'm going to add a very distinct symbol here devan,
And this should really get you going on what this is.
What does that look like.
Devan it's a spider.
Yeah.
Okay.
You're getting close.
Yeah, but why is it white.
That's a telly tubby, dude, that's not a spider anymore.
Collin i got to say man your guys got a super flowy cape.
For shooting gas.
Its how you can tell every time he shoots gas,
Cause his cape will go flutter flutter flutter.
Devan all right now i'm just filling it in.
Collin next up, here we go,
I'm going to add some contouring to mine here at the bottom.
Which should really give it shape.
Oh. nice artwork.
Oh, thank you.
I thought you were about to say nice this.
Cause i need you to guess this.
You went pink on the cape.
Devan it's on the highlight, so he's got a little bit.
Of a purplish pink cape.
Collin all right here we go.
We're going to add some finishing touches to mine.
All right now we got all the lines down.
So we gotta fill it in right now.
So first of all got to fill in my little dudes over here.
He's wrapped in a blanket devan, just a little sleeping bag.
Okay.
He's just trying to enjoy a night when this character.
Shot things out of his hands to grab his face.
Oh my gosh.
Is that a clue.
Yes, that was a huge, that was the clue devan.
That was a huge clue.
Oh, i have no clue what it is.
Oh my gosh.
Finishing touches are done on mine.
Now its just time to cook it, let it roast.
And wait for this to finish.
Devon one last spot right here and done.
Before we flip the pancakes its time to find out.
Who buys what.
So we've got the coin of destiny and remember whichever.
Face lands up that's the person who wins,
And the other brother is going shopping.
Lets see who the winner is, here we go.
In unison three, two, one.
Yeah.
What.
I win, i win.
Good for you, good for you.
Okay devan, this is very important,
You have to know what this is to buy me the right game.
Devan i have no clue dude.
Oh, okay well maybe when i flip it,
It will become more apparent.
In unison three, two, one.
Okay, devan, focus.
Devan when i go shopping i'll try to figure it out.
But now it's time to flip mine.
Collin this one is going to look insane bro.
I think this is one of your best pancakes you've ever done.
Devan oh yes.
All right, all right, all right.
Collin oh my god.
All right devan you're doing great.
You're doing great.
You know what, i think might need to stand up for this.

To buy.
Hopefully its exactly what i drew out of pancake batter.
We will be finding out at the end of the video.
You challenged us to make our favorite movie character,
So lets go.
I'm going to start with a large inaudible right here.
It looks more like patrick's star.
Did you give her a mustache.
Devan no, no. it won't be a mustache i promise.
All right next up, i'm doing the hand.
Collin my pancake really comes all down to detail.
I think i am crushing it right now.
Devan this next part should give it away.
If you haven't gotten it already.
Who do you think it is.
Tell me if i am right devan, i think it is.
He just whispered in my ear.
If you don't know who this character is,
You probably don't know movies.
That's a lot to say.
Im going to take that back, that whole sentence.
We're going to put that away.
Its now gone.
Devon all right now just going to add a line.
Right over here.
Collin going to fill in these large pink things.
On the side of his head, which may or may not be ears.
Oh my gosh yours comes along so fast.
Devon right now i am reinforcing lines i made earlier.
So that the pancake flips better.
Collin so just going to start filling in the pancake,
But there's still a couple extra elements to add.
Devan right now i am doing her face diamonds.
Collin you call them face diamonds,
I call them grills devon.
I think you gave her some grills on her forehead.
This looks like an assortment of food man.
You've got the arm burger,
You got a little bit of ketchup here.
Looks really cool though man.
The colors are all so vibrant on yours.
I can't wait to see what it looks like.
When you flip it over.
Devan same.
Now its time to fill in her multi tool.
Collin maybe its one tool, cause it only does one thing.
Do you know what it is.
Can i take a guess with sound effects.
Oh no, not really.
Is it-.
Not quite.
Your guy has gotten really crusty.
Collin well yeah, cause i am waiting for you bro.
You are taking forever, and you know what.
I will join him in crusty solitude.
Oh, oh wow.
So that's crusty collin.
I've always been crusty, i just used lotion.
So why is it white on the inside.
That kinda throws me off,
Cause i thought i knew what that was but why is it white.
Devan you shall see.
Maybe you're making a giant stick of string cheese.
Devan got to add the green light rays around it.
Collin looks like like a tea,
Like a matcha tea or something.
Devan mine is done.
Now its time to let it roast and flip.
Collin i can not wait to see how these look.
Before we flip the pancakes its time to find out.
Who buys what.
We have the coin of destiny.
I'm going to flip it up in the air and which ever side.
Lands face up, that is the winner and the other person.
Has to buy whatever they drew.
So here's the reveal.
You ready.
In unison three, two, one.
Oh what.i have to buy that for you.
All right, so devon won.
In unison three, two, one.
Nice flip.
I nailed it, art is on fleek.
Dude it's pumba from the new lion king movie.
Devan now its time to flip the pancake.
And that thing is going to look crazy man.
Here we go.
In unison three, two-.
Oh, oh, wait.
You want to win a fifteen minute video call.
With devan and i text the word draw to 81800 right now.
So pause the video, and text the word draw to 81800.
You'll automatically be entered to win,
And lets see how this looks.
In unison ready, set, go.
Oh my god,
That is the greatest pancake you have ever made devan.
Wow.
Because devon won the coin toss its time for me to go out.
And buy what he drew,
And we'll be finding out what i buy at the end of the video.
You challenged us to make our dream super car.
Lets go.
Starting off with my car, it's got a very distinct shape.
So, i hope you guess what it is.
I don't know what that is, its a burger.
It's two patties.
You know what, you've been winning most of the coin flips.
So i really hope i win.
Already devan, so what is this that i am making.
What do you think this is.
You are making a smaller loaf of bread.
Collin i am making myself in a matching shirt to my car.
This is me on the inside, self portrait dawg.
Devan looks like you put like cheese on your head.
Collin you know what, i'm done with conversation bro.
You're not even in reality right now.
So i'm going to fill my face in as red,
Because a lot happens when i laugh,
Which is kinda just in general,
My face gets very red very often.
There's a new arm right here devan.
This arm is-.
Your arm is really really high,
No he's waving get out the way.
Collin he's got a brochure for the car.
Devon instead of focusing on the brochure duty,
You should focus on the actual car.
Oh, the head lights are very distinctive,
They go like this, and like this.
And then like that.
Close enough.
Wait, why are you're windows blue.
It looks like your car is underwater right now.
It's suppose to be like reflecting the blue sky.
What car have wheels that pop out like that.
Collin it makes a lot of sense,
If you really think about it.
Like hard.
Devan now for the yellow break caliper.
Collin oh snap.
Now you maybe asking yourself devan,
In unison.
Collin where are all the door handles.
Devan what is that.
What.
No, no. i'm going to draw a very special someone in here.
All right, i'll give you a hint.
Devan wait what.
Do they have their hands on the dash.
Collin they're holding on for dear life like.
Devan is your car used.
Collin our nan says that its actually better to buy.
A used car devan, cause when you drive it off the lot.
It looses a lot of its value off the bat.
Depreciating assets.
In unison yeah.
Financial jokes.
We're doing all blue interior and sky.
I want my interior to match the sky.
You don't know if your looking straight at the sky.
Or into my interior.
Before we flip the pancakes it is time to find out.
Who is getting their dream car.
To do this we have the coin of destiny.
So right now time to flip up,
Whichever side is face up,
That is who is getting their dream car.
In unison three, two, one.

I got nothing against hello kitty,
Its just not quite my style.
Going to put that off to the side.
All right devan so its not its time for your big one.
Yeah, been kinda wondering why the whole car is missing.
And just the tire.
The reason is because i took your pancake around.
As like a shopping list with me.
I went to a lot of different places because i had.
To find the exact same car that you drew.
Dude, no way.
I don't want to blow the surprise, so here we go devan.
I have a blind fold right here.
All right i am ready. i'm ready. i'm ready.
So we got the blind fold here.
Going to pop it on like this.
If i can figure out how to tie this.
Its sliding around, what are you doing.
I untied it.
It's in my mouth.
What are you doing.
I'm just trying to tie it.
You're not pulling in the right direction.
I am sorry.
All right devan its time for you to get up right now.
And find out where i got my sunburn today.
So lets go.
All right devan so keep walking forward.
Okay.
Just like that.
Dude what is going on.
I swear there's going to be some sort of toy car,
Or some sort of prank.
All right stand right there, face just like that.
On the count of three you're going to remove the blindfold.
Three, two, one.
What, no way.
Holy cow.
This is like exactly what i drew.
