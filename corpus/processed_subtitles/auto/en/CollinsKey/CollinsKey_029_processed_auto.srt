What's up guys.
It's collins key, and welcome to the thursday vlog.
Now as you guys know,
April fools' day is right around the corner.
And you guys don't really know this side of me,
But on april fools' day,
Ever since i've been a little kid,
I've always been crazy mischievous.
I've always planned these crazy elaborate pranks.
To pull on my parents on april fools' day,
And it was the one day, no matter how crazy it was,
I never got in trouble.
It was awesome.
Today i'm actually doing something that magicians,
We're not really supposed to do.
I'm actually gonna reveal to you five.
Of my top favorite april fools' pranks.
These are easy things, fun things.
You can do this with stuff around your house.
Don't have to go out and buy anything.
Oh, and one more thing,
I just saw a screening of dreamworks home,
And it was such a cute movie. oh my god.
It actually comes out this friday, march 27th, in theaters.
So you guys gotta go check it out.
But without further ado,
I'd say let's just jump into these top five crazy pranks.
Let's do it.
Prank number one.
I call this one the die in toilet prank.
Now this one doesn't actually have to do.
With you dying in the toilet because that would suck.
This one actually has to do with food coloring.
Remove the lid from the toilet,
And i found that jell-o works the best for this.
Open up a pack of jell-o and pour it in.
This might not be enough, so open up another pack of jell-o,
Pour that in, and one more pack,
Because you know, we're awesome.
Grab out a whisk and whisk away.
Whisk, whisk, whisk. it's pretty fun.
Now you gotta put the lid back on and you're ready to go.
Now when someone goes to flush the toilet,
They're gonna be in for quite a surprise.
And let's just say the people coming in after,
They might be, um, wondering what just happened.
Prank number two.
This is a fun prank to do to someone in the shower.
All you have to do is just take the bar of soap,
And paint it completely with clear nail polish.
That way, when they go to use the soap,
It will not sud up at all,
And basically they're going to be left.
With not being clean after a shower,
Which kind of defeats the whole purpose of taking a shower.
Prank number three.
This one i actually learned from demi lovato.
When we were on tour together,
And it's quickly become a personal favorite of mine.
For this, you're gonna wanna grab your friend's phone,
Go into settings, general, keyboard, shortcuts, new,
And then type in a funny word like poop,
Or use your imagination,
And then type in a word this person uses a lot, like hey.
Hit done.
Now when this person types in hey,
It will autocorrect to.
Prank number four.
If you've got a friend or family member who.
Is always watching tv,
This one will be perfect for them.
Grab your remote and look for the led on the front of it.
Then, cut a piece of tape that's approximately the same size.
And cover the led with the tape.
Whoever tries to use this remote is going.
To be really frustrated to find out.
It doesn't work at all.
And, prank number five.
Now this one is great if you're lazy,
But you still wanna scare someone really bad.
Leave a note warning someone they're getting pranked,
And then don't do anything at all for the rest of the day.
And those are my top five april fools' day pranks,
And if you thought any of these pranks were clever.
