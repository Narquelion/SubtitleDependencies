What's up guys.
It is collins key, and welcome to the thursday vlog.
That's by far my favorite intro i've ever done ever.
Ever to a thursday vlog.
Now, for today's video i want to do something.
That i haven't done in quite awhile,
And also i'd love for you guys to find out new, cool,
And fun things about me.
Today i'm going to be doing a "ask collins key.".
And you guys sent me a ton of questions with the.
#askcollinskey, and we actually trended worldwide,
Which is absolutely insane.
Power to the keypers. you guys are amazing.
And reading off all the questions for you guys is.
Gonna be my alter ego joseph.
"are you the real slim shady.".
I think the question really should be.
"will the real slim shady please stand up.".
"uh. i'm gonna stand up cause i'm the real slim shady y'all.
Oh. oh.".
Just kidding dad. it's me, joseph.
Ha. swag.
"how excited are you for christmas.".
Yeah. woo. woo hoo.
Oh yeah. woo.
Turn it up. it's a christmas tree.
I found, a christmas tree.
So, yeah.
I guess you could say i'm a little bit.
Excited for christmas.
"are you a night person or morning person.".
Well, that one's easy. i'm definitely a night person.
"if you were a burger,
What part of the burger would you be.".
The most important part. the buns.
"sum up life in one sentence.".
Waffles.
That's a pancake, and it's frozen. perfect.
"are you going to release a magic video soon.".
Yes. there's gonna be a ton of new magic videos comin.
Out very soon, and i kind of want to take a little bit.
Of time to refresh my material so i can bring you guys.
New magic with new people and new, crazy reactions.
Hit the thumbs up button if you guys are excited for.
A lot more magic videos comin up in the new year.
"have you ever picked your nose in public.".
Probably, when i was a little kid.
But, the one time where i got called out on it,
Like i was in a class and the teacher was all like.
"collins. stop picking your nose.".
And i was just like, "huh.".
"do you curse.".
No flipping way. i don't use freaking gosh dang cuss words.
I keep it clean.
You know, i'm all like "mustard on the beat, yo.".
"can i hug attack you if i ever get to meet you.".
Yeah, for sure, like whenever you guys meet me feel.
Free to like jump, tackle, hug me.
It's really fun and.
Yeah. i just love meeting you guys in general.
"justin timberlake concert or eminem concert.".
I love both of these artists, but if i had to choose,
I would probably pick an eminem concert because.
"i'm the real slim shady yo.".
Just kidding guys. it's still joseph.
Swag.
"how many times do you blink a day.".
Well, during the day i don't think i blink that much,
But if i had to guess i would have to say maybe like.
5 or 6 times during the day.
"can you say yes to this question.".
Um, sure. yeah.
I will not answer this question. that's a no.
"i really wanted to watch your live streaming magic.
Show, but i am so broke.".
The live streaming magic show was so much fun.
It was insane.
And i'm definitely planning on doing a lot more.
Of those coming up here in the new year.
And i was really bummed to find out that some of you guys.
Couldn't make it to the show because you guys said.
You had no money.
So, afterwards i spent quite awhile researching and.
Trying to find easy ways for you guys to make some money,
And i came across this website called opinionoutpost.com.
And it's like, it's super cool.
Like, literally all you have to do is you take opinion-based.
Surveys and they give you cash and gift cards.
Anyone can sign up.

"what's 9 + 10.".
21.
"what's 9 + 10.".
21.
Wait, wait. didn't someone just ask that question.
I can't use the same joke twice.
Next question.
"how old is devan.".
Devin is 21.
Okay, i'm really done with that joke. let's move on.
I'm gonna be dropping my first rap album coming up here.
Very soon, but i want to make sure it's really good because.
"you've only got one shot. do not miss your chance to blow.
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo.".
Oh. hey guys. it's, uh still joseph.
Swag.
"what is your favorite thing about your keypers.".
I love how you guys are always so supportive.
And not only supportive of me, but like.
Supportive of each other.
And you guys are always quick to bring in new keypers.
And tell your friends about the family.
"what type of styles do you like on girls.".
I don't know.
I think it's something that's really up to you.
Whatever you feel confident and good in.
I think that's what you should wear because it comes across.
Oh, but there is one thing.
When girls, wear like those high socks. haaah.
"you gotta bae or naw.".
One hundred percent single right now.
No bae for the holidays. oh. turn up.
"if you had to change your hair color what.
Would you change it to.".
When i was on tour with demi,
Like every day she would come to me and be like.
"hey collins, you want to dye your hair today.".
And i was like "i don't know what to dye it to.".
I'd probably go with, like, dark blue.
"who is your favorite rapper.".
I mean, well you guys, you guys already know what.
I'm gonna answer for this.
Chief keef. just kidding.
"it's slim shady y'all. what'd you even think.
Uh ha, uh ha.".
It's still joseph. still joseph. swag.
