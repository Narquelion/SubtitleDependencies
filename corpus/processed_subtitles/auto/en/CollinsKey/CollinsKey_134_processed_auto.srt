Both three, two, one.
You guys challenged us to do the pancake art challenge.
We're kicking off with minions.
That's not a minion.
It's like a very long yellow worm.
First things first, we're just going to forget i did this.
Oh whoa these are kinda like bouncy, bro.
I just shook this thing up.
Dude, what did you do.
Devan already.
It blasted my thumb, bro.
Oh no, this is terrible.
We haven't even started yet.
Devan's already creating art over here.
Devan i know, i got my little overalls, i'm ready.
I'm not good, this is not going to be good.
You guys know devan is like a professional artist.
I'm not.
My minion, he got very wide in the hips all of a sudden.
My minion, he's like wearing a dress bro.
Like a skirt or he's hula hooping bro.
Dude, my minion is swole.
I thought you got like batter all over me.
At least it's not as bad.
As the first time you did this to me.
Collins devan, what just happened bro.
So i was told to shake up this pancake batter.
Oh nothing will happen.
It'll be fine, devan.
Another one, boom.
Winning.
Now the last thing i want to do,
My minion's awesome and trendy.
So he's going to have purple hair.
Got me again.
Devan you'd think you would learn.
Oh no, what are you doing.
Collins making little hairs bro.
I want to get him so he's got some little ear hairs.
What.
Collins boom, full heat, roast 'em.
This dude's arms look like a second pair of legs.
No they look like nice stiletto high heels or something.
Collins bro my minion looks more like a scary monster.
Than a character from despicable me.
It really does.
Collins can we just appreciate the attention to detail.
That devan's doing.
Time to flip my minion, here we go.
Dude it's smoking.
No it's sizzling bro.
We're going to eat all of the pancakes at the end.
Of this video, and also after each round you guys.
Can judge us and let us know who you think won each round.
Alright let me see if i can get my stiletto high heels.
Oh there we goo, boom.
The flip, three two one.
Burnt toast so bad.
His face is like, "i got roasted.".
Three, two, one.
Oh that one looks so good.
Devan he has no eyes, but--.
Collins bro, mine looks like he hits the gym.
Way too much and skips leg day every day.
The big reveal.
Both three, two, one, ta da.
So you guys get to comment after each round.
And let us know who you think won,
But right now we're on to the next one.
Y'all suggest--.
Y'all.
We'll just start with the y'all.
Y'all suggested that we make.
Did yours not fire.
I didn't know we were doing it for real.
Yes.
Y'all suggested the laughing crying--.
Whoa.
What.
I got it all over my shirt.
Three, two, one, go.
I need the black stuff.
Get it to me.
Devan okay have fun.
This is going to be the laughing crying emoji.
And it's going to be legendary.
Yo this guy's got brows on fleek man.
His eyebrows are the biggest part of his entire face.
Currently at the moment.
Yeah, yeah his eyebrows are massive.
Ah, his eyes are too small.
Oh well.
Bam, nailed it.
Oh my god dude i'm crushing this bro.
Devan oh my gosh, those teeth though.
Call me an artist.
I really made this way too big.
Way too big.
Ah it splattered all over me, not again.
Oh no, something moved.
That was not good.
The pressure's on.
Here we go, three, two, one.
Devan that's kinda weird but.
It turned out pretty good.
I'm using red.
And even though it's not exactly what we though it would be.
That's what life is all about.
Devan i want to get in on this action.
This looks like fun.
Collins let's go bro.
Devan going for the long distance shot.
Collins boom.
Oh man.
Look at that.
Oh no.
Are you kidding me.
You got it on my face.
Here we go, three, two, wait wait wait.
First i've got a challenge.
I want to see can you subscribe to this channel,
Turn on the channel post notifications.
And give this video a thumbs up in seven seconds.
Here we go, you ready.
Both seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, done.
If you can do that comment down below keyper squad.
Right now and let's flip this pancake.
Both three, two, one.
No, no, no.
You ruined it, my beautiful pancake.
It's ruined no.
Devan wait you flip it, i'll flip it backwards.
No.
Hold on your elbow's in my face.
Sorry.
It's a catastrophe.
Flip it.
It looks so scary.
It's like evil bro.
It's like the laughing, crying, angry face emoji.
I'm literally crying, like my face is this.
Because when i laugh my face turns red.
Well we are laughing, we are crying about this emoji.
Both three, two, one.
Yeah, this uh--.
I don't know.
It touched my finger.
It's so hot.
I'm going to flip it back on.
Next up, a rainbow.
The dude's literally spreading his oil.
I am picasso.
I must make my pancake batter look awesome.
My  oh it got me again.
My hands are just a mess currently.
Your hands are more like a rainbow than your rainbow.
Yeah.
Alright.
When is enough.
This is one of those moments where i'm taking a risk.
It's a creative risk.
You'll have to wait and find out what it's truly become.
You left it all over the base of the thing so it dripped.
It's not my fault.
Yes it is.
It is my fault. it's all your fault.
Collins yeah this did not go according to plan.
I tried to turn it into a rainbow mushroom.
A what.
A mushroom that's a rainbow.
What is that.
I thought it was going to be very cool conceptually.
It didn't work.
Yes, we disconnected successfully.
And here comes the flip.
I need the green.
Oh no, i broke you my rainbow.
On a casual flip, no.
My rainbow, help.
I have an idea.
I know how i'm going to win this round.
It's a double rainbow.
It's a double rainbow all the way.
Victory is mine, i've clearly seized the win on this one.
In the meantime i'm going to work on my pancake flippery.
No, yeet.
I've fallen.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue devan.
You hear that.
What.
I don't know.
You mean the song.
I cracked my knee.
Alright.
I don't know if you heard that but it was powerful.
Time to flip.
Yes.
Devan three, two, one.
Oh my gosh.
It looks great but there's no yellow, so yeah.
It's my no yellow rainbow versus his--.
Collins double rainbow.
Both three, two, one.
Ta da. - yeah.
It's tough on this one.
I don't think either of us really won.
What.
Clearly definitive leader here.
Let's go to the next one.
You're right, you're right.
Next up.
Spiderman, spiderman.
Does whatever a pancake spiderman.
What. - let's go.
Devan alright.
The sizzling as it knows my spiderman.
Is going to be awesome.
Now for the moment of truth.
Flipping mr. spidey.
Ooh i can't wait.
I'm going to go for like a slide and.
Technique.
Three, two, two, here we go, one.
It looks like spiderman got mixed with like a basketball.
It does.
Collins he has like a little freckle.
Alright here we go.
And this was suggested by the instagram keyper of the week.
So shout out to you and if you want to be featured.
As the instagram keyper of the week,
Check the description down below to find out how.
And let's see how this turned out.
Devan three, two, one, whoa.
That actually kinda turned out okay.
Collins that looks so good.
Devan that turned out better than i expected.
Basketball versus face mask.
It's fine, you can vote for his.
I won't be offended.
This is by far the most requested one.
And it is a fidget spinner.
So right now devan, back at it again.
Making another fidget spinner, this time out of pancake.
So let's do it.
Will it spin.
Uh probably not.
I've really got to get some wins coming here.
In this home stretch because--.
Ooh.
Things have not been good so far coming up to this round.
But hopefully this last one will be redemption.
See devan has just begun his while mine is being flipped.
If that gives you any metaphor.
For how devan and i are different, that's how it goes.
Mine looks like a weird glob with like hands.
With eyes on it.
It looks like everything except for a fidget spinner.
It looks like a flying saucer with eyeballs all over it.
Three, two, one go.
Yeah it works.
Alright now time to see if they actually spin.
Here we go three, two, one.
Ooh, ooh it's hot.
It's not.
Should we eat it now.
Now it's like a weird ring bro.
For the final freestyle round we have 30 seconds.
To create our masterpiece.
Begin. - oh no wait.
Really.
Collins oh man i'm going way too big.
Devan why are you bumping me.
Why are you bumping my arm.
Collins i'm going way too big.
I had a brilliant idea.
Devan that actually kinda worked right there.
Okay alright.
Collins oh that was such a good idea.
Devan i need purple.
Collins nope, oh my gosh this is not enough time at all.
My masterpiece is not a masterpiece.
Devan take the blue.
Collins i need the blue.
