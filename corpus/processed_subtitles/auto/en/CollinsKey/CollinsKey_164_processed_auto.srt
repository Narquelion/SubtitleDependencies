Popped out the womb first.
Hey fans, i'm flexing.

Funniest memories of each other.
I peed on someone.

No, not really young. i was a baby.
I was like a few weeks after being born.
No, you were like five bro.

Apparently babies have like uncontrollable bladders.
Or something like that.
I don't know.
My grandma, she was changing like my diaper and stuff,
I guess i drank a lot of milk, so i was like yo, bro.
I gotta let it out and i was like.
And it hit my grandma smack in the face.
And she was just like woah.

But you weren't born yet.
On to the next one.
All about aggression, devan will be arrested.

Everybody clap your hands.
Are you competitive.
Both yes.
Whenever we play like team games,
We can never be on opposite teams.
We'll get too upset at each other.
If one of us wins.
It's terrible.
Favorite memories of devan.
Once i was like, i'm a ninja man,
Like i'm a freaking ninja.
And so i was like, bro, i'm going to stand over here.
You take the ball, shoot it at me.
And i'm a dodge and catch it.
Then collins was like no man, i'm not going to do it.
I was like yeah dude, you got to do it.
And we were like home alone and everything.
And i was like bro, i'm a freaking ninja,
And he was like, no way.
So i guilt-ed him into it and then he's like.
Standing there.
I was like aiming at him, so i don't hit him.
Yeah.
I'm going to like, go to the side and then shoot.
Sure enough, which way did he decide to dodge.
Bam.
He nicked my finger, because i had to like grab the lever.
I was just like oh my god.
I was the freaking one who got in trouble.
I know.
Mom got home and just went ham on me.
It was the greatest thing.
And he was just like, yeah i don't know why.
He would shoot an arrow at me.
Literally was the best.
