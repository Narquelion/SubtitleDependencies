What's up, it's collins key,
And welcome to my brand new life hack video,
And for this video, to follow along,
All you're gonna need is just a soda can and a quarter,
And i've actually signed my quarter on both sides.
So you guys know this is the exact same quarter.
Throughout my entire life hack.
And what you're going to do,
Just start tapping your quarter on your soda can,
You're looking for a soft spot.
Doesn't make sense.
But right there. yeah, that's it.
So check this out, if i take this quarter right here,
And look at this, we go, one, two, three.
Looks pretty crazy, right.
And check this out, from the outside you can't even tell.
That anything's happening, the outside is totally fine.
Even the bottom,
You can't tell that anything just happened on the bottom,
And the top of course is still factory-sealed.
But this is where it's crazy.
Because if you take your can and if you shake it,
I don't know if you can hear that, but listen to this.
Now, i just shook it out.
So i don't want to splash you guys at all,
But check this out, if i take, if i open up here,
Oh my gosh.
Let's see.
I actually brought along a cup right here,
We'll just dump it out.
And check this out.
Look at this.
I want you guys to see, check it out.
You guys can see right there, you guys can see the quarter.
With the signature on it.
So, this life hack right now blew your mind.
If you can't wait to try this out,
Make you guys share it with your friends right now,
