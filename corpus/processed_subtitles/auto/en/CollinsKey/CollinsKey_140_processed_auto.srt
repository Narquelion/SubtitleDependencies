That you can make new voices with it.
Hello gabby.
Yeah.
All right, well, that was worth a shot.
All right.
Thank you.
Have a good night.

That was great.
That could not have gone better, in my opinion.
Perfect.
Nailed that, from top to bottom.
I'm calling bruhitszach or zach clayton.
So i hope that this goes well.
Yo, what's up bruh.
I just got the new iphone 7, dude.
There's this new setting in it where i can like.
Make my voice in like family guy.
Right, give me a line to say.
You look like a monkey.
You.
Look like.
A monkey.
Right, bro, it's crazy.
Dude, it's nuts.
Even like peter.
Give me another line to say.
You smell, okay.
You smell like cheetos.

If you feel yourself sinking in the cold, cold water.
No, bro, i'm doing a prank call.

All right guys.
The next person i'm calling is chloe couture.
Voicemail you have reached the voice mailbox of.
This is chloe.
She called me back.
Hey.
So with the new iphone 7, like i just got one.
You can manipulate your own voice in a cartoon voice.
So just give me a sentence to say like i'll show you.
Chloe is the best youtuber of all time.
And she is awesome.
Yeah.
It just manipulates my voice into that.
Let me just try something, hold on.
I think you're great.
You're so pretty.
You're always pretty.
Right. it's so.
Yeah or even if it's just on a call like this.
Here's another one too.
If you sneeze, make sure you use a tissue paper.
Yeah, i know.
It's really, really, really cool.
And there's even patrick from spongebob and stuff.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Like i don't have to go to the bathroom.
I was just saying that and stuff.
So my idea is like if we prank call youtubers,
And use the voice on them.
Cause what would happen would be like we would call.
The youtubers and prank them and they would think.
That i am actually calling them to set up a collab.
But in fact, i'm actually calling them.
To prank call them with these voices.
Kinda like right now.
No, this is a prank call.
Yeah.
Yeah i'm here with my friend, mikey,
Who does voice impressions.
Sorry for pranking you.
No, it's mikey.
Nope, all me.
My bad.
Yeah, no, i'm so sorry.
Have a great night.
All right.
We're going to give rachel a facetime.
Is that a thing when you give someone a facetime.
I'm gonna give her a facetime.
One facetime for you.
Do you know family guy at all.
Okay, well you can do a family guy voice.
I'm gonna try this one.
I like cheese a lot.
Right.
And i can try a peter voice too.
And it's like.
I like.
Whipped cream.
On my waffles.
Tell me like something to say.

I don't know how else to say it.
That's just yeah.

That does voice impressions and stuff.
Hi, sorry for pranking you.

All right, so we're calling jake foushee right now,
And he has a new number so i don't have his new number.
Mikey does.
There'll be a couple of hooligans doing voice prank calls.
Yo, brother.
This is  collins.
Why.
I appreciate it.
You're the man, bro.
Do you have the iphone 7.
Okay dude, i just got one.
There is an e-straight feature on the iphone 7.
That will manipulate your voice.
Into any cartoon voice or something.
Give me a sentence to say.
All right, i'll try it like peter.
Let me see if the peter one works.
Ah,
I just started a fire.
Right.
Even if it's like making noise, you can turn it.
To kermit the frog and make weird sounds.
Hip hop hebop sneerop.
Kermit the frog here.
Hap ho up keep up.
I know, man.
Apple took away the headphone jack.
But they gave us the voices, man.
It's like crazy.
Yeah and it even works with song lyrics and stuff.
And it will sing popular songs like.
