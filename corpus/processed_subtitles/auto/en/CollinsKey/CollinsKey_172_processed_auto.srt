When you have macaroni and cheese duct tape.
On your envelope.

By liking this video and comment down below.
What part of the world should i taste candy from.
This one's got leopard print on it.
So it kind of caught my attention.
And i'm not sure where this is from,
I'm not sure who it's from.
I'm sure we'll find out inside.
But, yeah let's do it.
Alright, so we got some newspapers.
I'm like, low-key more excited about the fact.
That these newspapers are in another language,
And i don't even know what's inside of here yet.

Will you go to prom with me.
This is, i gotta admit, this is pretty legit right here.
This next on here is from sienna,

What it is.
Like i gotta be super secret with it.
But in the meantime i've been binge-watching a ton.
Of the other hello labber's shows.
One of whom is grace helbig and it is freaking awesome.
She has a show called writing with grace.
And it is absolutely crazy.
It's a love story, but there's flying cats and dogs,
There's a crazy group chat,
And i believe there's no gravity as well.
Like the whole thing is just completely out of control.
So this week i challenge you guys.

And the best part of this.
Is that grace is gonna be reading her novella.
