We are kicking it off with something called.
Mustard greens. - ew.

Oh. - oh.

So i definitely want to win round number one.
Somehow i got the girl cut-out.

Oh. what. - what.
Dude, you must have done something wrong.
Let me try it like this.
Whoa. - whoa.
Why is it doing that.
We've gotta go quickly.
All right, here we go.
So put our head in.
Two, one, go.
No.
I actually got so panicked.
During that first round.
I forgot which way it needed to go.
And so i saw it going that way.
And i'm like,
It's going to hit me in the face.
All right, here we go, devan.
You are going down.
It's time to add this nastiness.
No. no.
And bro, you have to keep your mouth open.
As this hits your face, remember.
That's part of the rules here. - what.
Oh. - oh.
All right here we go, we're just gonna to mix it all around.
Oh, jeez.
Oh, no.
I think i'm gonna throw up.
Oh, this is so gross.
Round number one.

His foot's shaking, you guys can't see,
His foot is shaking on the ground right now.
Two.
One.
This is gross.
No, get off me.
No.
I think i might throw up.
Those two tastes just do not go well together.
All right, and now the first ingredient.
Goes into the massive pie right here.
I really hoping you get this.
The mustard greens-- - i'm hoping you get this.
Remember, whoever loses the most.
Has to get hit in the face.
With a cocktail of everything.
I'm literally crying right now.
Round number two.
Let's get it.
Now you know this wouldn't be a key brothers.
Challenge without some eggs involved at some point.
So we have some eggs here.
That's true. - so the next pie is gonna be.
Whipped cream and eggs.
And we've taken off the faces because, just, no.
Wait, i want to do this.
Okay fine, yeah, you kinda get to.
Oh, jeez.
Bro, that last one looked so nasty.
So i do not want to lose this at all.
I don't either, three, two, one, go.
No.
No.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
I'm so ready.
Oh.
Collins this is going to be so gross.
So nasty.
Wait.
Oh, what.
That's not even part of the challenge.
What are you doin'.
It's the anticipation.
Dude, what was that.
I'm sorry. - bro.
Uh uh.
Like, whenever i see eggs.
There is just this feeling.
That i need to crack it on someone's head.
Ew, it's all yolk-y.
The yolk's on me.
We are now naming this the jackpot pie.
So, before i hit him in the face with this pie.
I'm going to take a little bit of this.
Since we don't have enough eggs left and just.
Ew.
Collins it's like eggs that are like, half scrambled.
So we've got some eggs shells as well.
I'm just gonna add that for some flavor.
Is that gonna hurt if that hits your face.
Do i have to do this.
It's just such bad-- - it has to be open.
Bro, open.
All right, three, two, one.
Ow, my nose.
Ow, my nose.
No, you can not hit me.
I did not hit you with that.
You can not hit me with that. - okay.
Okay.
All good.
I'm all good.
All right guys.
This is round number three and we have.
Oh. - oh.
We have a whole sardines.
Like, we have a whole sardines.
I need to win this round.
I need to win this round.
I don't want a full sardine goin' in my mouth.
Here we go.
This one, that one's done.
All right, devan if you could please reposition.
It back to the middle.
All right.
May the best hand win.
High five.
Psych. okay, here we go.
Three, two, one. - three, two, one.
Oh no, it's too close to me.
No.
No. yes. - no.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes. no.
No.
No. - no.
You have two hands.
You had two hands, devan.
I used all resources to my ability.
I don't want a full sardine in my mouth.
This is so nasty.
I'm so not excited.
That's a huge one.
I'm already. dude.
With the sauce.
That was unnecessary.
First he went with the two hands.
Now he put the sauce in there.
Bro.
Bruh.
The smell of it.
This looks bad. - it's quite overpowering.
This looks really, really bad.
Ready. - no.
You gotta open up your mouth.
You have to, bro.
That's not open enough.
Bro.
All right.
Three.
Two.
It burns, it burns my eyes.
Okay, let's get paper towel then.
I've got some paper towels. - rescue.
Rescue my face.
It's actually burning my face.
It went to my eyeball.
I think it's making it worse almost.
Yeah, it is, i know.
Oh. - what.
What.
Oh, it smells. - what.
I didn't realize how bad it smelled.
You just wafted some my way. - i know how bad it smells.
I didn't do anything.
You did this to me.
Now we are on to round number four.
Kimchi.
Devan what.
How do they fit all that kimchi in there.
You can't even put the top back on.
For those guys who don't know,
Kimchi is one of the.
Nastiest ingredients i've ever used in a challenge.
I first discovered it when i did a video with glozell.
We did a smoothie challenge and it annihilated us.
It's very important that i win this round.
Number one, so that i don't get that dumped on me.
And number two if i don't win this round.
I lose the entire challenge right now.
It is very important that i win this round.
This is a make it or break it round right now.
Put it on the hands.
That's good.
Okay, ready. - nope.
Three, two, one.
No, no no no no.
You're moving it.
You're moving it. - yeah.
You're moving it.
No.
Yeah.
Here we go.
No.
Yes.
I like this one.
That's just way too much now.
That's excessive.
First i'm gonna put a little bit of kimchi into this.
Devan that's perfect.
Oh that's great, nice.
Great, nicely done.
C'mon kimchi.
Work with me.
Oh. - oh.
No. - dude.
I actually would take the sardines over this any day.
No, i'm glad i didn't get the sardines.
The worst thing about this one.
Is you know you're gonna get a piece of it in your mouth.
Collins all right, here we go.
Okay, i might actually throw up this one.
Mouth has to be open, remember.
Ah.
Are you okay.
No, i'm not.
I did get it all in my mouth.
What do you need.
I have some sardine juice. - no.
Get that away.
Any time i breathe i'm just getting kimchi everywhere.
You guys, give me a thumbs up.
For the fact that we have taken a lot of,
We have taken a beating in this video.
Round number five.
This is chopped clams in mystery liquid.
One of 'em goes in the, ew.
Why you gotta do it like that.
Collins it's just chunky.
Devan you're going to get some on me.
Ew. - it smells like decay.
Right now it's a tie game.
Devan.
Let's do this.
All right, here we go.
All right, devan. - yeah.
May the best man win.
We start on the count of tree.
Shrub.
Bush.
Tree.
You started early.
You're pushing it my way.
No.
No.
Yeah.
Yes.
Oh no.
It's just all liquid. - bro here we go.
Here we go.
Can you like, not do the liquid.
Maybe just the clams.
Like just need the clams. - oh, i'm doin'.
All of the liquid, bro.
Collins it's the mystery liquid of the clams.
Devan oh, i gotta do this fast.
This is goin' on your face right away.
All right, bro, you ready. - no.
You gotta open-- - just be careful with it.
Three, two.
He hit my hand.
Oh, i got your hand.
Yes.
Can i get some paper towel.
Ow.
I'm not happy.
And we're on to round number six.
For this round we've gotten creative.
And taken all the things you would.
Normally put on a hot dog,
Mustard, relish and pickles.
And we'll be putting them in a pie.
This is the most important round of this entire challenge.
Because if devan wins it's game over and he gets to.
Hit me in the face with this pie.
And if i win this round then it goes to the tie-breaker.
For round number seven.
And then who knows what's going to happen.
We're going back to the one hand only rule.
What.
No more of this two-hands shenanigans, all right.
We're goin' back to the basics of the old school.
Okay, fine, all right. - one hand.
So place your head down.
All right, here we go, three, two, one, go.
No. - yes.
No. - yes.
No.
Yes.
Wait, it didn't even get you.
I know, you were pushing it that way.
Wait, no.
I got you. there we go.
This is actually better than what was about to be on me.
Here we go.
That looks really good.
Why don't we just leave it at that.
And i'll just kinda - no.
Take these.
No. you sure.
I'm pretty positive.
Oh.
Yeah, that looks pretty gross.
All right, here we go, so we've gotta add some into.
The jackpot pie here in the middle.
Oh. - oh.
This stuff disgusts me.
Devan oh, why.
I'm gonna try to do a long shot with the mustard.
Oops, i can get this, i can get this.
Then we've got the pickles last.
Okay, the smell of it.
Devan there's like, no whipped cream in there, man.
This one is making me sick just lookin' at it.
Devan, you ready.
I'm ready, let's just get it over with.
This thing is just overflowing with goodness right here.
All right, devan, open your mouth.
I actually apologize in advance for this one.
Because this is disgusting.
Ready.
Three. close your eyes.
Make sure your eyes are closed.
I need to see it comin', man.
Two. really.
If this gets in your eyes it's game over.
One.
Dude, don't do that.
I need a paper towel.
You know what.
It wasn't as bad as i expected it to be.
I'm not going to get you again, i promise.
You can feel my hands, i have nothing in my hands.
Just give me a paper towel.
Okay.
Now this is burning my eyes.
Ow, it hurts the eyes.
Did you get it in your eyes.
Ow, i opened my eye for like, a second.
Here. - whoa.
I'm good.
Dude, your eye is so bloodshot.
I'm good.
This is it.
Round number seven.
The round you've all been waiting for.
The tie-breaker.
Whoever loses this is getting a pie.
With all the nastiest ingredients.
From this entire video.
In their face. - i'm so nervous.
So much on the line right now.
Protocol on this one devan is of the utmost importance.
Head on the game.
Hands on the button.
