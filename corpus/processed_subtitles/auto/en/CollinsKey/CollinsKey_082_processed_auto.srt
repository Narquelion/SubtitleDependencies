Three, two one.
What's up, it's collins key,
And welcome to the thursday blog.
Now for today's video, i've got an insane.
Holiday-themed challenge for you guys.
We're going all out, we're going extreme.
Just like these ridiculous blow-up things.
We got in the background.
But i do need someone very special to help me out,
So everyone please welcome back to one of my videos,
My little brother devin key. ayy.
Don't fall on the dinosaur.
Oh no.
That was close, we almost killed the dinosaur.
For today's video we are going to be doing a gingerbread.
House building competition.
You're a little bit too far away from me right now.
Am i.
There we go, now we're in an uncomfortable place.
Where we can just kinda tickle each other.
But you gotta ask yourself,
What makes this challenge extreme.
Two things, thing number one, we are not just using.
One gingerbread house each, we are combining.
Two gingerbread houses, and we are using.
Mega gingerbread houses.
These things are massive.
So we got them laid out in front of us.
You guys can really tell who's the neat sibling.
And who is.
No comment.
The next part is that the loser of this challenge,
To make it even more extreme, their gingerbread.
House gets destroyed-- - yes.
With a sledgehammer.
So that is going to be happening at the end of this video,
So make sure you guys stick around to see whose.
House gets completely annihilated.
I can't wait for that part, it's gonna be.
My favorite part of the entire video.
And also i'm doing a holiday giveaway.

And without further ado, let's jump into the extreme.
Gingerbread house building competition.
And actually, there is one more thing before.
We get started and that is.
I've got some presents here for you devin.
Oh, i have some presents for you too.
Oh, you do.
How sweet of you. - yeah.
So here we go, yeah, there you go.
Let's do the big on first 'cause we love presents.
And let's see, oh snap.
We've got-- dude this is so.
Look at my reindeer, what is up.
So we are gonna to be wearing ugly christmas sweaters.
That we got for each other.
Hey, this guy has some swag going man.
Mine does not, look, he's wearing a bow tie.
What the heck.
And then let's see, what's in the smaller one.
This is-- i'm a little bit concerned right now.
I have no idea.
Whatever it is, we're going to have to wear it.
What the heck.
What.
I'm not-- what.
I don't wanna wear this.
And now it's time to try these on, so yeah, let's go.
Yo dude-- - what.
You're actually kinda rock that.
Oh, these shorts are ridiculous, check this out.
Look at this.
Oh man.
Mine's got a little fly.
Yeah, do a little wiggle, there we go.
Ay, making jingle bells.
Begins now, go, go. - what.
All right--.
I don't even know where to begin.
Where do we begin with this.
Well i think actually i need the frosting first.
Taste good.
It's probably just like pure sugar.
Eh, tastes okay.
Now i think if i just push it all down.
Yeah boy.
Let me just double check, triple check.
Yep, it's working, okay.
All right.
You've already got a lot going on there, so i think.
Oh no, i've been putting it all on the wrong side.
So, i put all this on there, but it's not working,
So i have to remove it now.
Now it's been removed from the outside,
Now i can put it on the inside where it's suppose to be.
Dude, you're on top of this game.
I don't even know what i'm doing here.
I'm gonna steal devin's idea, low-key.
Okay, here we go.
What are you doing.
What am i-- what.
Okay, that looks--.
You have nothing over here man.
All right, actually, you know what.
I'm gonna make a cube, a cube of joy.
Okay, what did i need.
I need watermelons.
What.
You're almost done, what the heck.
I'm just too good at this.
Just too good at this.
Yeah, devin's got some natural talent at this.
Where i have none.
I'm building like a little illuminati house guys.
That's what i'm doing.
Oh no.
It almost fully broke.
Get some cool whip.
Why are you using cool whip, what the heck.
What. - yeah.
So it's more sturdy on the inside.
No.
Sorry, it almost-- my house is so bad.
I've actually never tasted cool whip before.
You haven't.
No.
I don't know how to do this, that's the real issue here.
It's pretty cool.
I've realized that just applying this.
In a pastry manner is not my specialty.
So i'm gonna go with what i'm really good at,
Which is just kinda like playing with my food.
So, i'm just gonna grab a glob of this stuff,
And i think i'm gonna go gorilla mode.
All right, whatever.
Ah man.
This is some cheap, cheap stuff right here.
Look at this.
It does not stick at all.
Give me a tip or something 'cause i'm just going.
Down in flames over here.
I'm just trying to-- i don't know.
I can't figure this thing out.
If you can't precision, just do it every way.
Yeah.
I need another thing, a triangle 'cause.
Always got keep it illuminati in this.
Don't, don't.
I will give you one of my people from my village.
If you can hold this just for a second.
I don't need your people, but i'll do it anyway.
'cause i'm a nice brother. - all right, thank you.
Wow, your house is.
Yeah, it's interesting.
I think this piece will go like this here.
Oh, yeah, it goes on this side here.
Oh, there we go.
This is brilliant.
I should of gone into architecture, dang it.
No, no, no.
Here we go.
All right, so now i've got some cool whip.
For added structure on the inside.
Just gonna grab a handful of this.
Let's see, just gonna put that in there.
Get another handful of this, gonna put that right there.
Okay, this is all for added structure as well.
That's a lot of cool whip.
Since my little gingerbread people will probably.
Be abducted at some point, i'm gonna put them.
Inside my house.
That way, they will remain safe at all times.
So my little gingerbread people--.
Oh, there we go, inside the house, okay.
In the house.
And then we have another thing of cool whip.
Over here just 'cause i wanna make sure that my.
House is really fortified on the inside.
This is what i do for snow, to really just make.
Sure that there's snow happening all over it.
All right, there we go.
So that's good for the snow part of what's happening.
This is the decorating part.
See how i can just tip my candy.
It is beautiful. - it is literally green.
This can not be--.
All right now for this part here.
Okay, now see these green ones on.
They're pretty big too.
Sprinkle them on there as well.
Actually, know you, i do want to build a secondary.
House to what's going on.
This is the time of captain jack sparrow.
A pirate so brave on the ocean blue.
A mystical quest to the isle of tortuga.
Brave, something, sway on the da-da-da.
I can use some of this stuff to glue my illuminati.
House together.
I love your illuminati house.
What the heck.
I think this challenge actually perfectly describes.
Us as siblings, like the difference between our houses.
And the sides of our tables.
This pretty much describes the way we go about things.
Yeah, i'm just a mess.
All right, here we go, more cool whip.
For my illuminati tee-pee.
Kinda, there we go.
It's on the hand right now, then it's like.
And you just plop it in.
And now it's time to take part three.
Of the illuminati cottage.
Illuminati cottage.
All right, so now i've got the candy canes,
And instead of putting the candy canes.
And taking them out of the wrapper, i want.
To make sure they stay fresh throughout the.
Holiday season, so i'm just gonna adorn it.
With the wrapper still on there.
There we go.
I'm gonna take a thing out of his book,
And i'm gonna do that with these little guys.
Who would want to eat another man's gingerbread house,
And he knows that these things have been touched.
Yeah, i don't wanna do that.
That's no bueno.
Keep in the wrapper folks.
No bueno.
I really just want to create the atmosphere.
Of just snow, and so i'm gonna turn my place.
Into the wonderland of snow right now.
There we go.
Now it's like a snow kingdom if you guys notice.
My reindeer got decapitated in the process of all this.
I just know what i'm doing.
How is that even possible.
How. i don't know.
That's crazy.
My reindeer is gonna be rudolph.
Bro, devin is straight up a savage when it comes to this.
He nailed this on so many levels.
I think i'm just gonna kinda, just add a giant.
Grinch spice to what's going on.
Is that my person riding.
That's the grinch.
You've got a door.
Yeah i have a door.
That's so cool.
So nice.
Mmm - how is it.
I need a christmas tree.
Five, four, three, two, one.
The christmas tree fell into this area.
And stop.
These are the final houses.
Devin, would you like to describe yours.
My house is a luscious house.
It has these mint-condition mints on the top,
And we have some snow on the top as well.
And we have rudolph perched above.
Saving the day from this avalanche that has.
Struck the right side of the house.
We also have a door and a window sill, but no window.
Because windows are not cool.
They're mainstream, windows are mainstream.
My house, i really went for the environment.
You have the basic illuminati household right here,
Which is the large illuminati household.
And then you have the smaller illuminati--.
It's like a little cabin or like a little hut over here.
And then you just have all the great holiday goodness.
Thrown up into the front yard.
You have a decapitated reindeer.
You've got just all sorts of holiday fun and cheer,
And that is my house.
So we're gonna leave this up to you guys.
You guys get to decide who won this.
Did devin's house win, or did my house win.
So comment down below, let us know who you think won.
And now it's time for the part you've all been waiting for.
It's time to destroy both of these gingerbread houses.
Woo. can't wait.
So, yeah, let's get started.
All right, here we go.
I've got my sledgehammer.
We've got devin's gingerbread house, and yeah,
Let's get started.
Three, two, one.
Now it's devin's turn to destroy my house,
But instead of using the big sledgehammer,
That's for the big brother, devin,
You get this little sledgehammer right there.
Really.
Yup.
This is it.
That's it.
I don't wanna use this, this is weak.
Weak.
I have a much better idea.
What are you doing. - yep.
I'm getting out of here guys,
This is not going to be good.
Oh my gosh.
Where'd you even get that thing at.
It does not matter.
Yo, this is crazy.
All right, hold on.
Wait, wait, wait, i wanna film it in slow-mo.
I want to film it in slow-mo, hold on one second.
All right.
Three, two, one.
Oh. - oh.
So now that you've dropped that thing on it,
What do you say we just beat it up.
Oh dude, you almost hit me in the face.
Watch out bro, i got this, hold on.
I'm gonna hit that rock.
Watch out, i'm going for the rock.
Oh.
I feel like thor right now.
We should of got the eyewear.
This is not safe.
Oh, i hit my finger.
What are you doing.
You are crazy.
