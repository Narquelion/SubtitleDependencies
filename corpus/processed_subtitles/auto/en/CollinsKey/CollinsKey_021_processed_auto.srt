What's up, it's collins key.
And i'm here today at the 5th wave premiere.
With my little brother devan key.
Hey.
We're live here at the grove doing a live challenge,
Which is something that we've never done before.
And this is in honor of the film coming out on january 22nd.
And today we're going to be doing the seven second challenge.
And the reason we're doing this is because in the film,
Things are happening so fast.
They're having to just react.
To all these different things happening.
So right now we're gonna try to test this in real life.
We've got seven seconds to do some crazy stuff,
So yeah, without any further ado, let's get into that.
Jump into the video.
So the first one is, tell us an alien joke.
Seven, six, five,
Four, three.
Oh, an alien walks into a bar.
Ow.
Yay.
Alright, a lot of fun guys,
I'm gonna go just cry now.
Let's do this,
You guys wanna see us do a little competition right now.
Audience yes.
And you were asking about muscles, right.
You wanna see some muscles.
Okay, we're gonna see who can do.
More push ups in seven seconds,
But you guys have to count them down, okay.
They have to be real push ups.
They can't be like the weak ones, you know.
They have to be real push ups.
You're putting me on blast already, alright.
One, two, three, go.
Audience seven, six, five, four.
Three, two, one.
Audience member devan.
I did eight.
I think he did eight.
Who can drink a water bottle the fastest.
Three, two, cheers, go, go, count.
Audience seven, six, five, four.
Three, two, one.
I wanna see how many little,
I don't know what they're called.
What is this over here.
Woman skip-it.
Looks like a medieval nun-chuck or something.
Seven countdown, here we go.
Starting right now, go.
Audience seven, six, five, four, three.
Collins no.
You good.
Alright cool, devan won.
He won, i didn't even get, i didn't even do one.
Dude, i literally almost just died.
I just literally cut my finger up just now, on that.
That was just great.
Did you really. oh i'm sorry bro.
Hashtag blood, sweat, and tears for these videos bro.
Do an interpretation dance,
As though your body was taken over by "the others.".
So basically, just dance how i normally dance.
Yeah i guess.
Whoa, give it up for collins key, what.
Next up devan, you have seven seconds.
To successfully do a cartwheel.
Seven, six, five, four.
High five as many fans as possible.
Guys, put up your hands like this,
So we can see if we can do this.
Here we go, go.
22.
No, i lost.
22 hands.
No.
So i see we've got some weights over here.
And you know what, we don't usually get to do.
A challenge live, so we don't get to see.
What do you guys want us to do with these weights right now.
Just yell it out.
