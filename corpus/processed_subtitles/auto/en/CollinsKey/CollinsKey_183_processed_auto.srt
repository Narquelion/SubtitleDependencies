You challenged us to mix flaming hot cheetos with milk.
Oh, this does not look good.
This is such a weird food combination.
Ugh; are you ready.
Three, two, one.
I thought the milk was supposed to make it not spicy.
It's still spicy.
Why would anyone do this.
That tastes so, ugh.
You guys challenged us to a whole bunch.
Of crazy weird food combinations that people.
Actually seemed to love and so today, we are going to be.
Trying all of them, right now, let's go.
Time to find out what the next food combination is,
Here we go, three, two--.
Oh wait i think we're forgetting something i think we're--.
Oh yeah yeah yeah, sorry, at the end of this,
We're mixing all the foods together.
Into the weirdest food combination of all time.
So this is the bowl of doom, we're going to.
Leave it over to the side.
Alright now that we got that out of the way,
Three, two, one, oh, wait what.
Doritos, marshmallows and nacho cheese.
Oh my gosh.
Alright, that looks good. - i think that's enough right.
Oh, i have an idea.
Ooh, what.
I think we should dip the marshmallows in the cheese.
But first, we juggle.
Oh no. - that's not even juggling.
I completely failed, hey.
Four ball juggling fam, yeah that's lit.
Back to three balls.
Distractions.
Suh dude.
Alright i'm ready, going to dip it in,
Wait, stop stop stop.
That actually looks pretty cool.
I'm just gonna just plop it in.
Devon nice.
So let's do this, actually i think.
We should just pop the marshmallows on here because.
We've got to melt them as well.
Devon and now we're going to drizzle.
The final step; i have no idea.
How this is going to taste though.
Boy dude this actually looks amazing.
It smells phenomenal.
Oh it smells 10 times better than this other cheeto thing.
Like the chips mix with the marshmallows.
And then the nacho cheese, heavenly bro.
Oh, oh oh oh, cheers.
This is gonna be so good bro.
Wait wait wait wait wait but first.

Maybe.

Yep yep yep haters gonna hate devon,
And then for the win, pickle mania, yeah boy, woo.
