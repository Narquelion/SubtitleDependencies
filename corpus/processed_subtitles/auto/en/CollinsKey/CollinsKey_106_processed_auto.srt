Hey, you look great.
Fantastic, really.
Collins i don't think it's the right look.
Collins, let's just see what it looks like.
Under the lights, okay.
Pose is good, on your mark.
What's up, it's collins key,
And for today-- - that was great.
Let's reset for the trick.
Get the fire marshal in here.
We're shooting this with the pyrotechnics.
Has anyone seen martin.
I mean how did you do that thing.
With the handkerchief and the egg.
That was like insane.
I almost forgot my lines.
But like seriously, how did you do it.
One second.
Oh, hey.
Woah.
Yeah, i know.
I didn't think you would come.
I know how important today is to you, so.
Eddie told me you dmed him to apologize.
That was really sweet,
But i came here to actually talk to--.
Hi, i'm ashley.
I'm playing his best friend.
Would you mind giving us one minute.
Sure, but i'm gonna get that secret out of you.
One way or another, collin.
Actually, it's.
Do you wanna sit down.
I'm really sorry i let you down man.
I've been an absolute jerk. - no, don't.
I get why you're mad.
No, you don't.
I,
I've been thinking, you know about.
Me and eddie and,
And you.
No, and i get that because.
You want to be with eddie,
And i'm going to be.
Way more supportive. - no, no, no, no, no.
That's not what i'm trying.
To say. - no, i know.
You're trying to say.
What you're trying to say.
What you and eddie have is,
It's a real relationship,
And i think that's why i've been.
So crazy these last few days.
Because it's the first time in my life.
That i've actually.
Had even the opportunity to have.
What you and eddie have.
I think i was really falling in love back there.
Now she's gone.
And look, it's just a picture of a trailer.
There's no clues, no puzzles.
Time's almost up.
I just didn't realize.
How much you actually cared about her.
What would you do if.
You loved someone so much but.
You knew something that would mean.
That they would be happy,
But it would also mean.
That they-- - but what.
If you love someone, you want them to be happy.
Yeah.
I know where she is.
What.
She hasn't left l.a.
It's just another clue.
The trailer, you can rent it.
See, now you know.
God, i love you, you're amazing.
Thank you.
But before you go, i need to tell you something.
What's up.
I um.
Ashley collins.
Collins, they're ready for you.
You know what, nothing.
Just go.
Go, go, go.
You're the best.
I love you.
All right guys, i'm coming.
