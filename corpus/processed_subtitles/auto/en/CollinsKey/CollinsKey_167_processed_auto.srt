What's up guys, it is collins and as.
You guys can tell, today i am outside.
I would love to say i just came out here.
Because it was a lovely day, but.
What really happened is i spent like.
Two hours today trying to light.
This one area of my house.
It was not looking right.
I got really frustrated with that,
And i took the camera outside.
And i'm like, you know what.
This actually looks amazing right now.
For todays video i thought it would be.
Kind of fun to do some truths and some dares.
Basically i went on twitter and.
I asked you guys to tweet me.
A whole bunch of truths and a whole.
Bunch of dares, because the last vlog i did,
My brother and i, we chucked eggs at each other.
And they really hurt and you guys.
Seemed to enjoy that, so today i'm.
Gonna do some more crazy dares.
Let's get to it.
When was the last time you cried.
I don't really know how to answer this.
Because i am, i guess, like a more.
Sensitive guy.
It happened a few days, no i think it happened.
About a week ago.
Have you ever streaked.
I think i was like a baby i streaked a lot.
I think that's kind of a thing that a lot.
Of babies do.
Crack a raw egg over your head.
I brought along more than one egg.
Because let's face it.
I can't be basic like that.
Egg number uno.
Uggghhhh.
Two.
Three.
All right, there you go.
Check it out, i got a mohawk.
What.
Oh yeah.
Next question.
Oh yeah, chipotle.
I've been rejuvenated.
Thank you for the chipotle by the way, bro.
Is there a person of interest in your life.
I think i know what you mean.
I think i'm pickin' up what you're puttin' down.
Sorry, that is a really weird way to phrase it.
By person of interest if you mean like a bae.
Or a girlfriend, no i don't have a girlfriend.
You know i just dropped my new single.
It's me.
I'm single.
Do a backflip.
Wait a minute, i gotta keep it real though.
How did your parents come up with your name.
My great-grandpa, he was some big-time stock.
Investor who predicted the great depression.
And did a lot of cool stuff, so i was named.
After him.
If you ever see someone type, like, colin keys,
Like, be nice, but feel free to correct them.
I was at the mall, i forget where i was,
I was on tour somewhere with demi, and this girl.
Runs up to me and she's like, oh my god,
You're keys colin.
From the x-factor.
And i was like, yes.
Who was the last person you texted.
Well, let's take a look here.
Jake paul, and i said, okay, sounds dope.
Mix a spoonful of ketchup with water and then drink it.
You know what, that's just not enough.
I thought maybe i'll use a bigger tablespoon.
'cause i think this will work.
A little bit better.
I still don't think that's enough.
You know what, this is extreme for an.
Extreme-dare video.
This is like 80% ketchup.
That looks so disgusting.
Eww, that is so nasty.
This is so gross.
It smells so bad.
I would literally throw up if i drank a couple more.
Have you ever been rejected.
That fly is crazy.
If you're talking about being rejected by.
Like a girl, no, but that's only because.
I've never really asked a girl out.
I'm kind of shy in that way.
Like, i can't just walk up to girls.
And be like, hey, i'm collins.
You should give me your number.
Let's go on a date.
That's just not me.
I'm finally getting over my awkwardness around girls.
I've been rejected by a couple girls,
Like nonverbally.
There was this one girl i had a crush on.
We were at the movie theater, there was like.
Eight other dudes and one girl and like.
I'm sitting next to her, i was like.
Oh yeah.
I should probably put my arm around her, right.
I went yawn.
And she just went.
I'm like yee.
You know, just yeetin' over here.
Just not even trying to do this yee.
Look at your timeline and retweet the first.
Thing that you see.
Bam, just did it.
I'll put the screenshot of the tweet.
Right around over here.
Do you creep on your fans' twitter and instagrams.
If you guys tweet me a lot, if you guys.
Constantly are tagging me in photos.
There's a really, really, really good chance.
That i've probably visited your profile before.
The moral of the story is, if you guys tweet me.
A lot and tag me in a ton of photos.
I creep on your profile.
Yeah.
That's kind of how it works.
Tweet nick cannon and call him beautiful.
And, done.
The bromance has been renewed.
Why are you not using vine anymore.
I'm definitely going to start making.
A lot more vines.

And i'm not gonna say when, where,
Any details like that.
Yeet.
