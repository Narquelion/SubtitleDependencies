With your hands like that.
You will ruin the wheels.
You got your hands clean so let's spin the wheels.
For the next ingredients.

I just spun it bro.
I'm going to predict that it's going to land on purple.
Oh so close.
Deven i got liquid starch.
And i got thermochromic pigment.
Both what.
I guess this is a thermochromic pigment.
A thermo what.
Slime.
Dude, this stuff is wild.
I can literally see, it might be like temperature changing.
If i put a finger in it, i want to see.
If it'll change colors.
Deven alright.
Collins put it here.
Both oh.
Deven oh my gosh.
No way.
Collins that is so cool.
Deven no way.
We're going to add three teaspoons in here, just not.
Too much at all.
Yo, this looks super cool.
One, two.
I cannot add any extra.
Otherwise it will be very, very, very bad.
So here we go.
We are going to go there and done.
I mean how bad could it be.
Deven no.
Oh my god dude i told you.
Not any more.
Alright, now its time to mix it around.
Oh snap.
I'm hoping i get some sort of like bonding ingredient.
To put this together because its not slime.
Devan, pn the count of three.
One, two.
You were about to say three.
Three.
That's not my fault, come on man.
Alright here we go.
Yellow, let's see what it is.
Please, please, please be something good.

Aye, aye, aye, let's go.
I was so close.
Time to add sta-flo.

Too much, too much.
Whoa, that looks super duper cool.
I think its my favorite slime i've ever made.
Dude this is awesome.
Bro, this looks so cool.
Collins yo, that looks insane.
Oh my goodness.
For once i thought i was gonna win.
Its like blue marble.
Oh no i got it on my thumb.
Ah i almost got it in my eyeball.
Oh snap.
This looks like an alien man.
Like look at this, it's like all stuck to the bottom.
Whoa, this looks so cool.
Whoa.
Three, two, one.
Let's see if it changes colors.
I can see it already.
Is it changing.
Yes, a big flip.
You ready.

There is not enough sta-flo.
This is too slimy.
I got you, here we go.
Oh no i'm so sorry.
That was so much sta-flo devan.
Oh man that might have been too much.
I think there is definitely too much sta-flo man.
It was so beautiful.
I'm so sorry.
I think i might have saved it.
It's like yellow right now but you guys remember how it.
Was all red.
This is all due to heat i guess.
If it's thermochromic, chrom--.
Chromic.
Chromic.
It will literally change--.
Deven dude that looks awesome.
Collins so it's on the table.
Alright.
Let's see if it changes colors.
Alright.
It looks like a giant blob right now.
Let's sped things up a little bit.
Yeah see it starts to go back to the red.
Now's the fun part.
I want to take a cool pack and put it on and see if it will.
Change the color.
I can see it.
Yo hold up look at this.
What.
Look at this.
It's like red because it's changing the color of it.
But it's stuck to the pack.
It's like lava.
Holy cow.
Look at it, you can see it changing immediately.
Alright we'll take a little piece of the yellow.
Gonna pop it on like this.
Then look, it's gonna change red.
Wow that's so cool.
Dude.
Alright now, i've got a hot pack right over here.
Alright here we go.
Let's see if the hot pack can heat it up.
Kind of at the top and then it goes right back.
The cold is definitely winning.
Alright, now mine might not change color but mine.
Is extremely soft so i bet you if you use this as a.
Pillow you'd be able to fall right asleep.
There's no way dude.
Oh yeah there is.
Just watch.
Collins.
That was like loud in my ear.
So these are the final slime.
But you guys get to comment down below.
Whose slime do you think won.
And right now it's time to make that.
Next mystery wheel slime.
So right now, let's go.
Alright deven, time to spin the wheels again.
Why would you do that.
We need that.
Alright don't worry i'll get it back.
So right now, let's spin the wheels, you ready.
Both three, two, one.
Let's see what i'm going to land on.
Green.
Red.
Bro, i got iron.
How do you make stuff out of iron.
I got foam beads.
No, no, no.
You cannot just handle that regularly.
Set it down.
We need to get you some protective gloves.
Okay, so let's try this.
Yo, those look great.
What.
Those are perfect.
I'm pretty sure these are not the right gloves.
No you'll be completely safe now.
There is no way the iron is getting through those gloves.
I don't think i can even open up the bag dude.
Just open up this for me.
I can't but i can punch it.
Well i needed that.
We'll get you some other gloves don't worry.
Oh there we go.
Dude that's my glove.
There, two, one.
Bam, there you go, you got your other glove.
You couldn't have put it on better dude.
Deven look at that.
Collins oh my gosh.
Is that legit iron.
Deven yeah.
Three, two, one.
I hope it's something good because right now i have no.
Idea what's going to make this work.
Ooh we've got blue, let's see what it is.
Deven liquid starch for me.
And i got clear glue.
Here we go, got the clear glue.
Just gonna add a whole bunch in.
That's gonna be a ton of slime.
Gotta be very precise.
I don't want to mess this up.
I have a feeling with such a rare item like iron.
This has gotta be some sort of special slime.
What did you do.
It almost flew out.
It kind of reminds me of like dna strands.
Like how they are all clumped together like this.
Oh yeah.
Ready to give it a spin devon.
I'm ready. - three, two, one.
Spin.
Ah yellow.
Ah, ah, ah.
Alright i've got cornstarch.
Deven and i got white glue.
Nice.
Wow.
So time to add in my sta-flo.
Oh i think i need more glue.
Okay.
Alright, there we go.
Mine's turning some sort of gray.
That's kind of crazy.
Yo, mine's actually turning out really good.
Holy cow.
It looks like a slime cereal.
You know when you run out of milk and then you have to.
Use water instead of milk.
I wonder if yours like actually gonna be magnetic.
' cause its iron dude.
Oh you're right.
Whoa.
This is so cool.
Wait i want to grab some.
Oh snap.
It's like the longest slime stretch i've ever had.
It's stuck to my glove.
Get it off, get it off, get it off.
It's the infinity gauntlet and i'm thanos.
Wait dude, it totally is like the infinity gauntlet, bro.
Check this out.
Oh devan, devan, where'd you go.
Gosh oh man this infinity gauntlet thing is not for me.
How do i get him back.
I guess the only way is to like use the time stones.
I got a little green one right here.
So i'm just gonna turn back time and now.
Wait dude it totally is like the infinity gauntlet, bro.
I think it worked.
What. - nothing.
Alright, you're all good.
Yeah, totally good.
Knuckles.
Wait no, okay no that was not in the movie.
How did this one happen.
Maybe if i put the infinity gauntlet on my other hand.
And do it to myself, let's him back.
Three, two, one.
Oh no, it didn't work, hold on.
Oh geez.
Okay we're good.
Wait so from the beginning i could have just clapped and it.
Would have, never mind, welcome back.
Alright i got my magnet.
Right there.
So i'm gonna lift it up here.
But it's dropping though.
Dude, i'm not even.
Dude, look at that.
Three, two, one.
Whoa.
The slime is like turning it off.
Collins it's just like devouring it.
Deven that looks so cool.
That is so cool.
So you get to comment down below who won this round.
At the end of it, one of us is going to be getting.
Slime dumped all over us--.
What.
So right now, we are on to the next round.
Time to spin the wheel right now.
Here we go.
And spin.
No countdown this time.
No countdown.
I'm gonna try to count now.
Wait, how did it stop.
It's like stuck in the middle.
I'm confused.
Oh snap.
Alright, i guess red it is.
Cornstarch.
I've never used cornstarch ever for slime.
Interesting and i got.
No.
I got glitter.
No.
No.
We are not using glitter.
Dude.
It's not happening.
So i'm gonna put this in here.
This cornstarch i forgot from the oobleck video.
This should be a good amount i guess.
This glitter is gonna get everywhere.
There is no chance that's it's going to be contained.
No, i will be very precise.
Ooh no, okay.
Uno.
Deven alright, alright we're good.
And now it's time for our next ingredient.
So let's spin the wheels.
Yay.
Deven i got clear glue.
Collins alright, i got water.
So, wait water.
This is gonna turn into oobleck.
Oh.
I love oobleck. - this is awesome.
Oh my gosh.
Alright here we go.
Gonna add two cups of water because i added.
One cup of corn starch.
So here we go.
Cup number one and this is cup number two.
Time to mix it up.
Let's get funky.
I forgot how weird this feels.
Alright my strategy is gonna add a ton of this clear.
Glue so i don't have any glitter on my hand.
Yes, it's turning into oobleck.
I forgot how cool this stuff is.
Guys, the thing about oobleck is that it's a liquid but.
If you squeeze it, it becomes solid and then it melts.
In your hand.
Like it's so cool.
Or if you punch it, you just.
Look at that.
Nothing come off. - oh my goodness.
Check this out,
If i put my hand in here and then i'm gonna try to pull.
It up on the count of three and you'll see what happens.
The bucket will come with my hand.
You ready, one, two.

Here we go.
And red.
I better put a dig on yellow.
Both oh so close.
I got plastic beads.
And i got clear glue.
I call this one, walkin' the plank.
See you just put a little bit of clear glue on the plank.
What, that seems incredibly inefficient.
Yeah that was way cooler in my head.
It was gonna be like wooo and then it didn't do it.
Because it sucks.
That's loud.
What.
That's a little more like it.
Having some troubles there.
I got to take the top off of this thing.
It's like you sneezed glue bro.
Party time, alright clear glue.
Now we've got the clear glue.
Clear glue added in.
Are you taking some of it out.
Yeah i think i used too much.
Yeah probably the best.
Alright now guys, time to spin for the next ingredient.
Here we go.
Both three, two, one.
You got blue.
Hey, wait, which color.
Ah, different color blue.
I got clear glue.
Collins and i got paint.
Oh.
That's a lot of paint.
Alright so i'm just gonna try to kind of gently mix it.
Together, you know.
Deven alright.
Just enough to tint it.
Deven my glue is in.
Alright let's spin for the next ingredient.
I'm calling it, blue.
Oh snap, i got it right.
What.
Alright let me see what i got.
Baking soda.
I got baking soda.
And i got water.
Really.
Alright i'm gonna add my baking soda.
Oh there we go.
You know you could have just opened it beforehand.
But it's okay.
Got it, bloop.
Time to take another stick and mix it all together.
That looks pretty bad.
Kind of like slushy.
Alright let's spin again.
Did you just hit your hand.
Yeah i hurt--.
It sounded like that hurt.
Red, let's see what i got.
Contact solution.
Oh, i got blue.
And i got, ooh, liquid starch.
Just what i needed, yes.
Collins i'm gonna do like a teaspoon at a time.
And see how well it's good.
This slime feels really weird.
It's actually kind of working out man.
Is it really.
It doesn't look like it.
This doesn't look like it's binding to you collins.
'cause it does to me.
Look at this.
It's literally a shlime on a shtick.
I'm gonna try to use this to catch my bucket.
You ready.
How about this.
We both for the first time get to choose one ingredient.
To add to finish it off.
So what do you want to pick devan.
Um, food coloring.
Okay, and you know what my choice is gonna be.
A little bit random.
I'm gonna pick some cheetos.
What.
I think this would be perfect for cheetos slime.
Hot and spicy.
Alright let's get the bag open.
Alright so i think i'm gonna take a couple of them.
Kind of like break them up a little bit.
And add 'em in like this.
It'll be kind of crunchy.
By the way, even though this may look delicious.
Don't eat it, not good.
You know i'm gonna take a handful and just kind of like.
Yo my hand is like all red from cheetos.
Wait.
Please.
It looks like.
No.
I've been caught.
Don't do it.
Red-handed.
Oh he did it.
Really bro.
I'm gonna add more cheetos to it 'cause yeah.
Deven you got way too excited about that.
Geez.
That's a lot of cheetos.
Wow.
Yeah, this is super crunchy.
It smells like a flaming hot cheeto in here bro.
It legit flaming hot.
Both dude.

And then just in like the middle of it.
How's it goin' over there.
Oh, not good.
It looks really gross.
This is disgus.
It's all slimy, slippery, and lotiony.
Deven it was so much fun before.
Holy cow.
It's like it, it's ruining my clay.
If i get another bad ingredient.
It's just done.
So i'm just gonna find some white glue and add it in.
Okay.
Eww.
Man lotion makes it really hard to open things.
Devan, can you open that for me.
Pour it right in that little pocket.
