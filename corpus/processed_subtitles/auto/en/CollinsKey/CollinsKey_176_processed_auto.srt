Collins i had overspill.
Yours is huge.
I know.
You're not gonna have enough yellow.

Comment down below who won this round.
This next one is super funny, you guys wanted us.
To make donald trump.with pancakes.
Let's do it.
Mostly the hair that matters.
Collins the hair is the main part of this whole thing.
You got some stylized art going on there bro.
Quickly, fill it in.
I'm laughing.
I can't fill it in because i'm crying.
Already looks a little better.
Oh my gosh.
Sorry mr. trump, wow, it looks like a terrifying.
I'm literally crying i'm laughing so hard right now.
You did a phenominal job keeping those wisps in place.
Just like donald trump.
Flip it.
Now comes the flip.
Most importantly is the hair.
His hair's comin off, it should never do that.
Trump's hair should never come off.
Oh.
It defies all logic.
Together nooooooooooo.
.
We'll flip the face first, we'll get the hair done.
Individually.don't worry trump,
We'll put you back together.
No, what just happened.
Flip it, quick.
Which way.
You gotta get that.
Oh no.
Oh no.
It's not in the flick of the wrist, i can't get this.
Collins there we go, okay.
Mine looks like a clown too.
Next is the hair, put the hair on like that.
Now we know how he does his hair.
Donald trump.
Or the joker.
Devan did not do too well on his.
The red mouth was a mistake.
This hair is not really attached.
It's an accessory.
It's an attachment.
Comment down below who won on donald trump.
Next pancake, let's do it.
 you guys suggested that devan and i.
We make each other out of pancakes.
 begin.
Collins i gotta give him some brows.
He has freckles and stuff, i'll give him green for freckles.
I didn't even add a nose for you, i'm sorry.
Yeahhhh.
 the flip of devan's face.
Sounds kinda weird.
I don't know how this is gonna go.
I don't think i have the proper leverage.
To do the proper flip.
Oh, yeah.
That actually looks really good.
Actually looks really good.
Collins it gives you a general line, relax.
No, no no.dude help me, the ear, get the ear.
