Collins you challenged us to make.
Iron man out of a watermelon, so let's go.
Devan time to peel the melon.
And i've got the spatula peeler, so here we go.
It's gonna peel it off like this.
You always wanna peel away from yourself like this.
I got it.
What.
I got the melon, bro.
It's dripping a little bit, you know, but here we go.
Just gonna try to gut my melon out, 'cause devon,
I have a completely different process.
Than what you're doing--.
Oh.
It's going over the edge. it's going over the edge.
Devan i've peeled the entire melon,
Now i'm gonna chop off the bottom,
So i have a sturdy base.
Ta-da.
It's all peeled and now it's time.
To shape the head.
This is what i'm gonna use for iron man's mask,
So here we go, we're gonna place it down,
As you can see, through my perfect art skills,
It literally has the eye holes already right there.
So next up, i'm just going to accentuate those,
You know, bring out his eyes.
You want to make sure you.
Shave it down very gradually,
Because you don't want to lose too much of the red.
See, dude, i can look through the mask, bro.
I'm becoming iron man.
Right now i'm scoring the side of it.
So i know where to stop cutting.
Now it's time to start shaping the head.
And i'm gonna be very careful,
Do not try this at home, but i'm gonna be shaving off.
A whole bunch of watermelon here, so here we go.
You made it look so easy when you were doin' it, man,
But this is, i gotta say devan, not quite as easy.
As you made it look.
And done, there we go.
Devan look at that, dude.
Yo, that actually looks really good, bro.
I got it fully peeled and now it's time.
To fasten iron man's face to this,
So here we go, we're gonna pop it like this.
First skewer's gonna go in and then all the way down.
And then just go straight in, alright here we go,
Goin' straight in--.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where are you goin' with that.
Right now i'm defining the neck.
And separating the helmet from the body.
My guy here, i gotta make the tongue,
But i gotta be very precise with how i do this.
What if i take a little bit of this.
And then pop it in here like that.
Bam, now we gotta perfect little clump tongue.
Devan finishing up the head shape.
And now it's time to make the mask.
Now, for the mask, you kinda wanna draw.
On the surface before you cut it.
Collins and i gotta give my iron man.
Some nice buck teeth.
You know, he's gettin' that real authentic tony stark look.
Devan now i'm gonna use the paring knife.
For the small eyes.
Wait, what step are you on.
I'm on the same step as you.
Collins i'm on the step of creating.
His face and his eyebrows.
You're definitely not creating eyebrows.
Devan pullin' off the side here, a big chunk.
Collins oh. how is that gonna help you shape.
Wait. what. oh my gosh bro,
Right now it looks like an alien though.
Devan now all i have to do.
Is just take off this back stuff.
And do that, i'm gonna give my guy a neck.
Really quickly just core out the center.
Of it, like that, boom, see.
Dude look, it like literally created.
A perfect ball of watermelon, man.
Devan i'm scoopin' out the face now.
To make room for the mask.
Collins and i'm scoopin' out the inside of mine,
Because it's very fun and i just, i enjoy doing this.
Got all my pieces and now it's time.
To assemble them and add the finishing touches.
Devan i'll be revealing mine at the end of the video,
And we're on to the next round.
Collins you challenged us to make giant pancake art,
So let's go.
Big 'ol head right there, like that, perfect.
Devan alright, so we're gonna give godzilla.
Some arms right here, so we're gonna give him.
A little arm over here, like yeah, what's up.
And then another arm over here, like yeah, what's up.
Devan i'm a little concerned,
'cause he's looking like a plump baby right now.
Collins devan look, my godzilla's lookin'.
At your godzilla he's like, he's like,
"what are you doing.
"why are you crushing all the buildings.".
Devan gotta get this crazy lean,
'cause godzilla's really leanin' forward.
Collins i'm gonna give him his little eyeballs.
Right here, and by little eyeballs i mean big eyeballs.
My godzilla's trippin' out, he's like,
"what is going on.".
Devan look, he's like a duck.
Collins your godzilla's lookin' like he's gonna quack.
While he's spittin' flames.
Does godzilla spit flames.
I think he does.
I think it's broken, yeah, it's broken, yep.
Devan i got his chest in place.
Collins alright, now i'm gonna give him little scales,
You know, this is very important.
I know that devan did this a lot on his,
He gave his guy a whole bunch of scales.
Devan now it's time to add the little spikes.
Collins i'm gonna give my guy some little red shoes,
Like he's little red riding hood.
No, who is it that has red shoes.
There's someone who goes, "dorothy the explorer.".
No.
Collins there's someone with red shoes.
And my dude's got red shoes.
Devan mine's grabbin' a car.
Collins that's not fair.
We can't add extra elements into it.
Yes, i can.
How would my guy grab a car.
Look at his arms, man, he's like,
"why would you grab the car.".
Devan alright, my guy's ready to add color.
Collins just gonna go all around like this.
No, dude, it's leakin' out the top again.
Shoot, this is not what i want.
You know what, this thing is ruined,
It's done, man, this is over.
Canceled.
Devan i'm taking some creative liberties here.
And adding some purple into his spikes.
Wait bro, you got that idea from me.
Mine have purple spikes.
Devan wait, you do.
Collins it's right there, bro.
Devan alright, this is the easy part,
Just fillin' it in.
Collins last but not least, i'm gonna give him.
A little welt on his forehead,
Because unfortunately he got bonked.
With the car that your dude threw.
Devan alright, the finishing touch is done.
And now it's time to let it roast.
Pancakes are cooked and now it's time.
For the flip, but is gonna be way too small, so yeet.
We gotta get the giant flipper.
Oh no, okay, here we go, here we go,
Get the arm.
Hey, hey, stop it, it's goin' great devan.
Here we go, so let's see, let's keep goin'.
Underneath like this.
Three,
Two,
One,
Oh.
Oh my god, bro, first try with a massive flip.
Dude, look at my guy bro, he's so good.
Devan alright here we go, gonna try.
To get underneath it.
Collins oh man, it's so brittle.
Are you sure you're gonna be able.
To do this without breaking it.
Devan ready, set, go.
Very delicately.
Together oh, yes.
Bro, that looks so crazy.
Devan he's actually kinda scaly.
Collins you get to comment down below,
Who won this round, you challenged us to try pizza art.
Devan and we're makin' spiderman from avengers endgame.
Together ohhh.
And we're off to a messy start,
Well, i got my dough, the thing is devan.
I think you made a large, round, mistake.
You have a round pizza, which is a big no no.
In creating spiderman's head.
But a big yes yes when creating pizza.
Yes yes.
Collins all right, well you know what, here we go.
Just gonna stretch it out like this.
Devan right now i'm just addin' the cheese.
Yo yours is way farther along than mine.
Yup.
I'm movin' right along to adding the pepperoni pieces.
Collins next up, time to apply the tomato sauce.
So i've got this tomato sauce applying stick right here.
It's in all the top restaurants in nyc right now.
Just take an even distribution of the tomato sauce.
On your crust, just like this.
Just roll it out like that.
Devan i really didn't think that would work,
But it kinda does.
Collins it absolutely does.
Devan now for the webs on spiderman's face.
I've cut up a whole bunch of nori sheets into small strips.
Collins just like you devan, time to add.
The white layer base.
I'm gonna add a whole bunch of onions right now.
Boom.
Wait, did you just say onions.
Exactly, just like you devan.
No. no no no, i added cheese, hans.
Wait, what.
Here we go, got some parmesan right here.
Devan hans, that is onion powder.
What.
That is powdered onion.
Devan putting in the final little touches, and--.
Collins oh, snap.
Devan wait. - what.
Oh. nope. totally good.
What are you looking at. - nothing,
There was nothing there.
I'm just wearing the merch.
Yeah, it looks great on you devan, oh it's nothing.
What. - oh boy.
No. - yeah.
How did that.
It was you.
It wasn't me. - it was this thing.
Collins that's not me, devan, do i look like this.
Devan but you put it there.
Face to face devan, do i look anything like this.
Actually the resemblance is uncanny.
Just doing the finishing touches.
On the outline of the eye.
Collins all right, now it's time for me to create.
My base, so i'm gonna use pepperonis, just like devan.
Devan got some sliced up bell pepper in here.
And i'm actually adding it around the side as.
A nice little frame.
So to kick it off with his eyes, i've got.
Two little olives over here, so go bloop.
You need some garlic powder to make the rest of his eye,
So here we go.
Now we gotta make the mouth.
I wanna use one of these bell peppers.
I mean, is this a bell pepper.
Really wanna find out if this is a bell pepper,
You do this, here we go.
Three, two, one --.
Well, the stem was kinda weak on that one, so yeet.
Devan i'm also on the bell pepper step as well.
Collins i'm adding it on his face here for his mask.
Gonna use my bell pepper as two little eyebrows.
You don't even know if that's spiderman or not, man.
Devan do you see these eyes.
Collins i dunno man, i think mine are much.
More expressive and emotive.
He's good.
Devan background's done, face is down,
And now it's time to add the onion eyes.
Collins if that was on a pizza hut menu bro,
I would buy it in a second.
Oh my gosh, your eyes are looking so good.
Now he's gotta put a few finishing touches,
Then time to pop these in the oven.
Pizza's are fully decorated and bro,
That looks just like spiderman,
So here's the big reveal.
Together three,
Two, - oh wait.
Collins five second subscribe challenge,
We wanna see if you can subscribe to this channel.
And turn on the channel post notifications.
In five seconds, you ready.
Here we go. - together five,

Go, ta-da.
Collins dude, that looks just like spiderman.
You get to comment down below, whose pizza.
Turned out better.
And we'll be eating them at the end of the video.
You challenged us to make pumbaa from the lion king,
So let's go.
Now that i've got the face down, it's time to shape.
Him into that pumbaa shape.
Collins and i've got some blue here to turn.
These potatoes into the night sky in the background.
Of my art, so here we go.
Collins, collins. - i'm sorry, i'm just trying.
To make it mashed, bro, - this is everywhere.
That's the reason why i wore blue, devan,
So this would not affect me at all.
You couldn't have given me the memo.
And movin' on.
We're gonna continue to.
Create the sky right now.
Devan grabbing some black beans for some details.
Collins you're very delicate with this right now.
The sky is the most important part of pumbaa.
Next up, time to make the body of pumbaa, so.
Boom again, we got some sweet potatoes.
Well, then.
Collins now just gotta get in here and just kinda.
Mix 'em up a little bit.
Oh yeah, try to extract the good, sweet juices.
Devan his tongue is done and now it's time.
For the cheese.
Wait, the what.
The cheese for his tooth.
Got the tooth cut out and now i'm gonna.
Make a space in the watermelon.
At what point are you gonna start shaping.
That into pumbaa.
You don't see it.
I thought i was pretty far along already.
You don't see it for real.
I mean, maybe that's the eye there.
No.
Gotta finish up all the hair around pumbaa's.
Head right now, so here we go.
Next up we gotta create the eyeballs,
So here we go.
It's gonna go down like this. - devan nice.
Collins now we gotta carve it around, so here we go.
Just gonna go kinda like this.
You're learning, young padawan.
Boom, there we go, look at that.
Eyeball is done.
This is pretty perfect, devan.
Are you gonna ignore that.
I mean, just the fact that it even is.
Remotely round when it started off in this.
Very clear square shape.
Even little bit of color is stuck to the side.
You know what i call this devan.
Blue cheese.
Devan ah, there it is. - collins yes.
Devan i'm adding in a second layer here,
Just adding more 3d elements.
Oh boy, he's looking kinda scarier and scarier.
By the moment, i gotta say.
Devan next up i'm using some strips of eggplant.
For the eyes.
Your guy is terrifying right now.
If that's what pumbaa looks like in the movie dude,
I gotta get my tickets right now from fandango.
Collins dude, look.
He's balding, so not a hair on the top.
Devan filling in the rest of the face,
Then i'm moving back to the eyes.
Collins and i'm gonna make some stars.
For my night sky 'cause i really wanna add.
Some depth and texture to my image here.
There we go, star number one.
Devan all right, the face and the nose is done,
Now it's time to add the nostrils.
All right, well now i gotta add in my round moon.
Shoot the moon.
Devan time to add in the blue sky and.
Put on the finishing touches.
Dude, your pumbaa looks just like a warthog,
And here's the big reveal.
Together ready,
Set,
Go, ta da.
Collins oh my gosh. - devan dude.
Collins that looks so good.
Devan and yours looks--.
Amazing. - collins thank you.
You get to comment down below who won this round.
And we'll be eating them at the end of the video.
You challenged us to do a bento box art pikachu,
So let's go.
Devan i'm startin' off with the yellow rice for pikachu.
Collins add some blueberries in just like that.
Perfect, so yeet.
Pikachu's done now, it's time for bulbasaur.
I gotta say, this blue works a lot better than.
The blueberries, man.
It's almost like too much, it's almost turning.
Too dark right now.
It's like those guys with those crystal balls, man,
They just go like --.
Yup.
Now it's time for the plop and drop,
So time to activate my bulbasaur --.
Devan you're who.
Collins my bulbasaur.
Three, two, one.
There we go, perfect.
So here we go. - devan wow.
Collins bulbasaur is in.
The thing my bulbasaur is missing.
Is his bulb, so i'm using an artichoke.
And i'm using an eggplant and an artichoke.
Next up, i gotta make pikachu, so i gotta get.
Some rice here, i gotta turn it yellow.
So here we go, add the yellow color in like this.
Devan i'm thinking this is gonna be more 3d.
Than my art normally is.
So i'm gonna actually have his foot coming.
Outside of the box.
And i'm going to use these carrots.
As little chopsticks to grab the chunks of rice.
Here we go, this is going to be pikachu's head.
So here we go, the next one.
Doing pikachu's body like this.
The issue is i got too much yellow rice.
For pikachu, so i got a different idea.
I'm only going to make.
Half of pikachu's head over here.
So half of the mystery is.
Where'd the other half of his head go.
I think it's time to move onto the background.
I've got the base done, so now i just gotta.
Add this lettuce in here like this.
Hey devin, i want to suck your blood.
Take those legs out.
Why not.
Yeet.
Excuse me, devan, that was a fleet.
If you're gonna fleet my teeth,
You gotta fleet them correctly.
The key to the background is to take this lettuce.
And we'll roll it up just like this.
And then place it in.
Next it's time to place pikachu's eyes.
Underneath the mushrooms right now.
The first represents his eye.
Once the background's done,
Now just gotta do pikachu's tail.
And bulbasaur's face.
And i got a mango here.
Just giving me the front of bulbasaurs, man.
Here we go. it's going to -.
Bulbasaur, collin, bulbasaurus.
I'm sorry, i'll get it right at some point.
Here we go.
I've got the mango stars,
So here we go, i'm gonna get this out right now.
Let's see.
Goin' in for pikachu's tail.
I kind of wanted to twist like a lightening bolt.
For a piece of art, bulbasaur's belly.
So, there we go.
Bam, look at that.
It's like, "check out my cute belly button.".
Now i'm using two kiwis.
One is for the top part of his head.
And now i'm using the other half.
For the lid of the hat.
My bulbasaur i'm gonna add.
A whole bunch of vines.
So that's a big part of his personality.
I'm gonna have a whole bunch of different types.
Of shrubbery pointing out of him here.
So, here we go, gimme a prickly fella.
Time to add his rosy cheeks,
And i'm actually gonna use these cherry tomatoes.
Cut in half and those will be his little cheeks.
Second cheek is done.
Man, my guy is looking really cute.
Yo, imagine if they had a pokeman bento box's lunchable.
That would be insane.
So next up, gotta a mango here,
And the mango is going to be charizard.
Wait, no, no, no.
What's his name.
Bulbasaur.
So, that's it.
Bulbasaur.
I'll pop it here like this.
Isn't mango pikashu's hat or bulbasaur's head.
Yes.
I guess i'm not gonna get an answer to that.
Yes.
Next i'm adding in the black part to his ears.
With the nori sheet.
Oh no, i think i added a little goatee on accident.
Gotta take it off.
Now detective pikachu would be nothing.
Without his magnifying glass.
I'm using this pretzel here as a stock.
The stock.
For the background, i've got.
A whole bunch of nori sheets right here.
Detective pikachu only works at night man, so here we go.
It's gonna crumple it up a lot--.
Only at night.
Just put a little glitter here.
Exactly, devan.
Yours is not only look like detective pikachu,
It looks like defective pikachu.
Mine is looking defective, dude.
Yeah.
What's goin' on with your guy's eyes.
He's just havin' a weird night, man.
He's a little bit of a tough case to crack, you know.
Now for the magnifying glass,
I'm actually using this agar-agar.
Whoah.
Look at that, dude.
Mine is holding a whole bunch of pretzels,
To make it look like i'm doing something.
'cause i have nothing to do right now.
So for the eyes, i'm cutting a raspberry.
In half and putting them on just like that.
Now it's time to make this thing look saucy.
The bento box art is facing.
Dude, yours looks so good, bro.
So, here's the big reveal.
Unison three.
Two.
Oh wait.
Three second like challenge,
We want to see if you can like this video.
In three seconds.
So you're ready.
Here we go.
Unison three.
Two.
One.
Done.
Ready.
Set.
Go.
Tada.
That looks so good with the magnifying glass.
And everything, man.
You get to comment down below,
Whose ding thing turned out better.
We'll be eatin' them at the end of the video.
You've challenged us.
To make a guardians of the galaxy bowl,
So let's go.
Step number one, we're melting down.
The organic unsweetened taro.
And i'm adding in the yogurt chips right now,
Some of the food has been kind of questionable.
And how delicious it would be.
But this, this looks like it's goin'.
To be amazing.
And now it's time to mix in the colors.
So, here we go, just gonna add.
A couple of drops right here.
I got my premade colors right here.
You are always one step ahead of me.
I gotta get better at this whole preparation thing.
I got my spoonful here and i'm gonna.
Start drizzling it onto the little bowls.
Going in just like this.
Oh my gosh.
Done with the blue, time for the pink.
I don't think i'm drizzling quite right, man.
How did you get your drizzle so nice.
While you're drizzling,
I'm gonna do the next step.
Which is painting the inside of these little bowls.
I don't think workin' out.
As well as yours does.
You gotta finesse it, collins.
Is this how you finesse it.
I'm switchin' up to the spoon technique.
No more brushing.
Next, i've actually got a different technique,
One where i'll be usin' balloons.
You just dip it fully in.
Lovely.
Now that it has a little bowl cut,
Just like devan, when devan and i when we younger.
Yup. that is actually us.
Yeah.
Time to pop this in the cup here.
So here he goes.
Oooh, he looks like a funny little dude.
Now that i've got the dollops in,
I'm doin' the finishing touches with a brush.
We blended up a whole bunch of bananas,
And this is going to act as the creamy base.
Now, it's time to create the galaxy.
Time to add in all the different colors.
First i've got some spirulina here.
I'm startin' with blue, you're startin' with green.
Power's all there man.
This is gonna amazing.
It looks like a whole bunch.
Of little stars and planets, man.
Yeah.
And get all of the grains and textures in it.
That yeah that didn't sound too confident.
Yeah, i don't know man.
Next up i'm goin' with black.
Oh, to represent, like, space.
Yup.
Yo. that got real dark, real quick, man.
This looks like some magnetic slime.
Now it's time to construct the bowl,
So i'm putting down the granola base.
I got granola bars, man.
These are granola bars,
You gotta mash them down.
In the granola you want it to be, just like that.
I gotta get some of this granola.
Are you serious, dude.
It didn't quite add enough, so here we go.
Gives it granola, so yeet.
You wanna add each color one at a time,
Right next to each other.
Next, i'm tryin' to add some of the edible glitter.
And oh man you gotta be careful with this stuff, i guess,
Just kind of give it a little sprinkle.
There we go.
This is your chance to add a different color.
Than you had before.
Exactly, time to do the swirl.
Unison three,
Two,
One,
Oh man.
Yeah.
Yeah, this multi-skewer approach is,
Oh boy, wrapping it very badly.
This looks great, man.
What about the one skewer.
Maybe his would be a little better.
A little dainty swirl, just like this.
Man, you're is looking way cooler.
Why's mine not turning out the same way, man.
Cause we both do the same process but--.
Yours is looking crusty.
Excuse me.
Now it's time to add the carrob balls.
And the awesome finishing touches.
Yo, dude, that was just like the galaxy,
And here's the big reveal.
Unison ready,
Set,
Go.
Ta da.
Collin bro, that is so crazy.
Devan it turned out so good man.
You need to comment down below.
Collin who won this round.
And we'll be eating them at the end of the video.
Devan we got all the foods.
And now it's time to see how they taste.
And mine's got someone's garlic powder.
And onion powder, bro,
It's going to be an intense experience.
Three,
Two,
One,
Oh.
I will warn you, it definitely has the ability.
To wreck your entire arm.
Oh yes, i am figuring that out right now.
Oh, no. my favorite part, the mouth,
I just wrecked his mouth.
Well, my guy just lost half his face.
That was his face.
I gotta get the slice right over here.
By his head, man.
And there's my slice.
All right, there we go, we got all the ingredients --.
Oh, oh. yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
I wanna see if the art tastes as good as it looks.
Ready.
Unison set,
Go.
Whoa.
You okay.
No.
Oh my goodness, this is one of the best.
Pizzas i've ever had.
That is an assault on the taste buds.
Yo, dude, that was so intense.
And right now, we're on to the next one.
We got out our detective pikachu bento boxes right here,
And time to see how these taste.
I got squirtle and what's this guy's name again.
Bulbasaur.
Bulbasaur, there we go, i got bulbasaur.
And pikachu, but just the top half is pikachu.
Oh, dude, it's going to be a mask.
Yeah.
I'm detective pikachu.
Whoah.
I'm going to--.
You're dropping everything.
I'm sorry, i--.
Great, i got the face of bulbasaur,
And i'm using the magnifying glass as the plate.
I got some blue rice as kind of a base right here.
It's like his nose.
Oh my gosh, yours looks way more.
Appetizing than mine, to be honest.
Can i just eat your pikachu.
First, you gotta grab and take.
The pikachu's hat like this.
Just like this over the kiwi.
Ready, set, go.
Devan what was that.
I bit the whole kiwi.
What.
That was not the best.
Mine tastes just as good as mine looked.
And mine tastes just as weird.
As mine looked, so right now we're.
Onto the next one.
We got pumba, now it's time.
To see how pumba tastes.
Bro, yours has got some weird flavors.
Going on like with the watermelon.
And the black beans and the cheese.
You know what.
I got to try them all.
So i guess for me, i'm going to start.
Off with my, with my shooting moon over here.
So it's going to slice right into it,
Bulb out just like that.
There's half of the moon right there.
Whoa, dude, it looks like it's bugging right now.
Its eyes are like, popping out.
Oh my goodness.
This is kinda scary, man.
If it wasn't scary already.
Exactly.
Oh.
Going right underneath and just like that.
I got pumba's face.
Oh my gosh, bro, that's like a pizza slice right there.
Yup.
All right, well, i got mine, you got yours.
I got mine.
And let's see how these things taste.
Ready, here we go.
Three, two--.
Oh, wait. if you want to win.
A fifteen minute video call with devin and i.
Text the word pizza to 81800 right now,
So pause the video, text the word pizza.
To 81800, you'll automatically be entered.
In to win and let's see how it tastes.
Ready, set, go.
I wanted the watermelon to make it better.
That's a terrible idea.
Why the heck would you do that, bro.
That was actually the key to this whole thing, dude.
Really. mine dish wasn't too bad.
Right now, we're onto the next one.
We got the galaxy bowls in time.
To find out how they taste.
Dude, look at mine.
It looks nothing like it used to.
Look at mine, bro.
What happened, bro.
I think they melt super fast.
You know what.
I got a finishing touch up for mine and here we go.
We got mine balloon and my bowl.
Oh, yeah, the bowl cut.
Yeah, so, maybe, excuse me.
We do it together on the count of three.
Here we go, ready.
Three, two, one.
Yes.
Now we gotta flip it up, gotta flip it up.
Oh my god. - nice.
Don't break it, don't break it.
All right, there we go.
The bowl cut is rather good but not yet really good.
Luckily, we got an even bigger one here.
Oh my gosh, look, oh.
What.
Oh my gosh, bro.
Time to scoop up some of mine here.
I'm trying to break one of these in half.
Why don't you take the whole thing.
Yeah, i'll take the whole planet.
Get some granola in there, yeah.
All right, well here we go.
Ready, set, go.
Whoa.

Maybe one of the best things we've ever made, man.
All right, right now we're onto the next one.
Got the pancake art, time to eat it.
And i gotta say, man, this is probably.
The crispiest pancake art we've ever made, man.
I know, it's about to break into ten pieces.
Just as i hold it right now.
Dude, i don't even know if i can get mine up, bro.
Okay, here we go.
Oh snap, bro.
Look it up.
He's coming for us, he's like.
That was a little close.
The leg came off.
No, it snapped in half.
My guy's not necessarily scary it's more awkward,
He's like, yo wassup.
He lost an arm.
Oh. and you knocked off my face.
You know what, how about this,
I'm gonna take off his head right now, boom.
And this is what i'm going to be eating.
So devan, ready to take a bite.

Yeah but other than that, it tastes really good.
We're onto the next one.
We got the watermelon sculptures.
And time to find out how these taste.
Those teeth are insane.
It's something special.
So, here we go.
