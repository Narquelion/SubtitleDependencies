First there was the board.
Then, there was the skateboard.
Then, there was the skateboard with steering.
And now for the first time ever.
It's here.
The cardboard.
The cardboard also know as the cybord, airbord, rolling device.
Is the future of transportation.
Why walk when you could be not walking.
Step, after step, after step.
Aren't you sick of it yet.
Don't you rather just be on wheels all the time.
Well, with the cardboard,
You will never not, not be on wheels again.
So what will it cost.
Similar products will cost you an arm and a leg.
But thanks to the cardboard's advanced design.
It won't cost you any body parts at all,
Just cash.
And did we mention that the cardboard is completely customisable.
Of course we haven't, we're only at that part now.
Well, the cardboard is completely customisable.
You'll never have the same cardboard as someone else.
With are crazy selection of colours, such as,
And for the really daring, you can even get it in, red,
Yellow,
Or, blue.
All mixed together to create a nice, prominent brown.
But that's not all.
You'll also be able to customise the safety straps aswell.
And not to mention the headlights and tail lights too.
So, how does it work.
Now i know what you're thinking,
The cardboard literately defines gravity.
So does it really work.
Well the answer is simple,
Definitely maybe it might.
You see, gravity is nothing more than a science word.
And so is the word oxygen.
Also know as o2, to most scientists.
Meaning there's two o's,
Tools.
And tools are what makes things work.
Meaning that the cardboard, indeed works.
The only place that the cardboard wouldn't define gravity,
Is in space.
Because there is no oxygen.
So how could you get the cardboard.
Well, unfortunately it is not available yet.
We've been having a really hard time funding our kick starter campaign.
Because all of the homophobic commenter trolls,
That keeps saying the cardboard is fake and gay.
But before you type that in this video let me ask you this,
Does this look fake to you.
Exactly, fake and gay.
More like real and gay.
So how can you help.
Now that you know all of the facts and information,
You know have a choice.
Nae.
A decision.
Nae.
A responsibility.
Nae nae.
To help us make this world a better place.
By bringing the cardboard to a reality.
All you have to do is go to our kick starter campaign and donate as much as you can.
Whether it's just a little bit or a lot,
As long as it's alot,
We'll take it.
Because without you, the cardboard is just silly nelly.
It's only just a dream.
So donate now and bring the cardboard to life.
And before you know it, we could all be looking like this.
Oh yeah, it's a transformer as well too.
