Hey guys so after much request i finally.
Played minecraft for the first time and.
I know a lot of you out there that don't.
Like minecraft probably gonna be like oh.
Minecraft is for little kids well it's.
Not it's for big kids too and yeah i'm.
Not ashamed to admit it i enjoyed.
Playing it sure there's no storyline or.
Objectives and maybe it isn't meant for.
People in their 20s in fact it's so easy.
A five-year-old to play it and maybe it.
Does have the absolute worst graphics.
I've ever seen in a game that's still.
Around today but i where was i going.
With this but seriously the graphics are.
So bad though i mean again the gameplay.
Is great it's just it's 2015 and the.
Characters look like this i feel like.
Just looking at them i can tell what.
Their voices sound like pretty normal.
What were you expecting some kind of.
Primitive caveman type of voice dudes.
Versus anyway i played it i liked it and.
I'm not afraid to admit it i enjoyed.
Playing minesweeper is so fun what's up.
Man dude i'm in the next room i can hear.
You oh sorry about that keep the.
Minesweeper falling down pardon me added.
Version doesn't even have sound right.
Minority report the movie does and.
That's probably what you heard me.
Talking about in the room next don't.
He's still in the cage because i was.
Going to watch it later after i finished.
Watching my minor league football.
Baseball team play in the playoffs which.
Is being held in my neapolis - oh no see.
Where the mining apple is 40 miners look.
I don't care if you play minecraft just.
Keep it down i'm sick i'm trying to.
Study not lying i would love to be there.
With my fellow 40 miners but i have a.
Torn meniscus in my knee and i can't get.
It fixed because i have no my knee see.
Whatever man just keep it down alright.
Yeah whatever.
As i was saying for those of you that.
Don't get minecraft at all i think it's.
Stupid i was just like you until i.
Played it how i understand it's actually.
Pretty deep it really makes you think.
About life i mean the graphics still.
Suck so the gameplay is amazing and it.
Has such deep meaning and by the end of.
This video you'll see exactly why with.
That being said here is my first.
Minecraft experience in real life in the.
Form of a movie movie trailer not a real.
Movie trailer but a youtube video skit.
Trailer just take a look.
I was spawned into this world with.
Nothing but the clothes on my back and.
Legs and feet i actually wanted to be.
Naked but the clothes wouldn't come off.
So whatevs i discovered so many.
Mysteries so many things that were just.
Physically impossible but then again who.
Decides what impossible is in this world.
Not me i never really believed in the.
Gods mo yang blizzard eval none of them.
The ancient tome or terms of agreement.
Manuscript had all the answers but it.
Was way too long so i skipped it and as.
The sun went down there was still so.
Many things i didn't understand about.
This world all i knew for sure was that.
This entire day this entire world was.
Just beautiful it was perfect.
I i had no idea what was to come at.
Night as a neck stickers tickle stick.
I will continue to survive with no.
Purpose will continue to exist not live.
What is life no purpose why are we here.
All respond in this world to do how did.
I know that i was gonna be dude oh hey.
What's up man it's just a game game what.
Game are you talking about you were just.
Playing minecraft minecraft i don't play.
Minecraft that's for little kids and the.
Graphics are so bad in that game i don't.
Even want i don't want to get into this.
Again good because i'm trying to watch.
My 40 miners play it's the bottom of the.
Ninth bases loaded we're down three and.
Whatever just keep it down okay okay.
Sick and tired how did i know that i was.
Gonna be interrupted these are all.
Questions i'll never know.
Just maybe maybe that's okay.
