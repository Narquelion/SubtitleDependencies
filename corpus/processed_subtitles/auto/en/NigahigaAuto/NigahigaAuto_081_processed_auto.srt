Hey guys so throughout my life i've been.
Called a lot of different things you are.
Amazed you're like the coolest dude man.
You're the greatest friend anyone could.
Ever ask for both man you're great and.
What he goes talking about golf loser no.
Not me the one thing i can't stand is.
When people call me lazy i am not lazy.
If anything i'm the opposite of that i'm.
Not late i'm on this lazy i'll figure it.

P.m. and i still have my pajamas on but.
It doesn't mean i'm not a hard worker oh.

Just uh turned into a lamp wow if you do.
Wanna go you said so sure well looks.
Like it's just you and me buddy okay so.
Maybe i can be a little lazy sometimes.
But i don't really think that being lazy.
Is a bad thing yes maybe i didn't learn.
That much in high school because i was.
Too lazy to study and i cheated to get a.
Good grade but i wasn't too lazy to.
Cheat right and i know most parents and.
Teachers that see this would be like if.
You're cheating you're just cheating.
Yourself you won't learn anything being.
Lazy that's not true at all if you're.
Cheating you're learning on a problem so.
For example the problem is that you have.
To pass a test to get a good grade sure.
You can spend hours and hours studying.
And actually learning things you sure.
You could be lazy and find a faster and.
More efficient way to pass the problem.
I'm not trying to encourage you to cheat.
On the test i'm just saying that if.
You're able to cheat and get away with.
It and get a good grade then you kind of.
Deserve an a because you helped smarter.
Than teacher but also goes the other way.
As well the teacher does can't do.
Cheating on the test you deserve an f.
You deserve an f because you're not.
Smart enough not smart enough to cheat.
The right way i'm just gonna go ahead.
And say i believe that lazy people are.
The smartest people lazy people are the.
Reason why we get to live life so much.
More comfortably today i mean i'm sure.
Back in the day people called the guy.
Who invented the dishwasher lazy as well.
Wow they're so.
You can't even wash dishes or what about.
The guy who invented the washing machine.
Wow you're so lazy you can't even wash.
Your own clothes or what about the guy.
Who came up with the idea of the car.
Wash wow you're so lazy that you can't.
Even wash your own wait what is that.
It's a car i got tired of walking so i.
Invented the car those are all people.
That follow lazier way of completing a.
Simple task and i don't know about you.
Guys i think they're absolutely.
Brilliant so for all of you lazy people.
That are tired of being belittled and.
Criticized for your brilliance i'm.
Standing up for all of you sitting down.
Sit just i think it's tiring you know so.
The next time somebody calls you lazy.
Whether it's your friends your teacher.
Your mom your dad don't get mad don't.
Get sad.
Be glad be proud say it out loud from.
The brightest cloud and even you one day.
That's that's all i got i didn't feel.
Like writing anything else i just.
Watched the video too lazy to light a.
Simple candle he found a way around it.
They were too lazy to drive so they came.
Up with a new way to get places faster.
Music.
Cut from his high school basketball team.
He locked himself in his room and cried.
Because he was too lazy to go back to.
Playing basketball his girlfriend broke.
Up with him but instead of chasing after.
Her he stayed in his dorm and created.
Something that would make her come back.
To him he was studying to become a.
Doctor but didn't finish and yet still.
Became one of the most successful.
Doctors of all time when their movie.
Series were coming to an end instead of.
Not being lazy and starting a new series.
They spit their last movie into two.
Parts and made way more money that way.
They didn't know how to end their movie.
So they let you do it for them you.
Wanted to make sure thomas edison was.
The one who invented lightbulb and not.
Benjamin franklin because he was too.
Lazy to pay attention in history class.
If you've never been lazy and done.
Things the easier way you're probably.
Not that smart.
