One of the bodyguards tried stopping me.
And i threw him across the stage and.
Just ripped his suit but i would always.
Like going google how to talk to girls.
And like they don't what to say off the.
High copy claps yeah all right so you.
Just clap in front of mike welcome back.
To another episode of off the peel.
Podcasts oh it's really quiet there you.

Applause.
Today we have a very special edition we.
Have a special guest well we have paco.
First of all in the moderator seat and.
We have a very special guest que si jj.
In the house visiting for actually how.
Long have you been here so what are you.
Hearing we just did a collab so yeah.
Little were just here as a sideman doing.
Collabs of everyone you'd say i'm out.
Just a clap yeah oh literally just a.
Week of collabs well i guess that's good.
I mean that's that's a lot of work who.
Else did you guys come up with face.
Faces yeah we did a few videos of them.
And yeah that's that's gonna get lazy i.
Think we've in total recorded main.
Channel videos like four which is four.
Yeah we really don't like full main.
Channel videos wow so now we're just.
Like enjoying ourselves and then you're.
Filming in tonight yes and tomorrow and.
Tomorrow is filming yeah it's crazy yeah.
Well i think this will be out before.
Your video but we will probably let you.
Know on other social media when that.
Video comes out just did some we did.
Some stuff today mm-hmm so we found out.
This is your first podcast in the you it.
You've done podcast but in the u.s.
Claiming it you've taken my virginity.
There you go that's the one thing we.
Wanted to do okay sighs podcast sherry.
Yep sweet delicious nutritious all right.
There goes our money like so what else.
Have you been working on your album just.
Came out right so yeah all we came out.
Two weeks ago.
And managed to get a 17 and the official.
Charts and number one on r&b charts.
Which is insane for us we've been.
Working on this album for so so long and.
To finally put it out and for people to.
Absolutely love it it's just.
Unbelievable so yeah we're just yes.
That's awesome all right now so i think.
For listeners who don't really know who.
You are it's not you and a side minutes.
Use randolph right yeah mia right now so.
We did the joint album and we released.
Ten songs and you have people are just.
Going nuts over us i think the most.
Interesting thing about it that really.
Grabbed the headlines as well is you.
Guys i think talked about how you're not.
If people use your songs in their videos.
And stuff you're not gonna like.
Copyright strike that yeah right.
Nothing literary will like why i mean i.
Grew up being able to use cover music.
Before the youtube started like clamping.
Down on everything but i was just like i.
Wanted to essentially go back to that.
And for me like it's not all about the.
Money i just want to just do use it cuz.
I just enjoy it's just the hobby for me.
So to be able to allow people to use.
That means use my music in their videos.
I think it's just i guess well it's the.
Whole new age yeah i'm trying to never.
Work with a label yeah that's why i'm.
Independent.
Yeah i'd literally the best thing yeah.
To be able to be independent and let me.
We'll just use your music and you know.
Just literally go against the system.
Essentially and yeah i think it's i.
Think it's a nice move.
I mean you were signed i guess we can go.
A little bit deeper on this because.
You're one of the few youtube musicians.
Who are actually signed to a label right.
So maybe you can i was signed to ireland.
Yeah and then it kind of just went a bit.
Self i don't know if you're allowed to.
Talk to it maybe nda's or whatever but.
What was your experience i guess pros.
And cons with it you know i i guess pro.
Was you can be honest dude you don't.
Have to say think of any pros.
I guess they allowed me to collab with.
People i wouldn't be able to collab with.
So waka flocka.
I was able to do a song with him and not.
Like i wouldn't have been able to do.
That yeah so they were able to get that.
Connection but uh.
Besides died that they didn't really.
Push me like as much as they could have.
So i don't know i mean they guess i.
Guess they helped a bit but i'd say con.
Wise they they didn't really focus on.
The music that much this way they focus.
On everything but the music they just.
Saw my marketing they just yeah exactly.
I saw my audience and were like okay.
Let's try and make an app for him and.
Let's try and monetize the app so that.
We can get money through that let's try.
And get a clothing line for him and.
Let's try and make money through that or.
Let's try and do this or this thing i.
Was like wait let's focus on the music.
First like i have music let's you know.
Push that and they then they never.
Really got behind it so eventually i did.
My did my term on the contract and then.
Peace down right so they were just.
Basically milking you yeah their.
Followers me so was this during the.
Whole like like when you were like a.
Like having the fight and stuff like no.
No this is way before okay so this was a.
Like around - yeah - out 17 haha 2017.
But you know 2017 maybe in a bit of 2016.
Yeah.
So essentially like when i had my break.
Like my long six seven month.
I was still signed to ireland so they.
Were still expecting like an ep so i had.
One more epa of just like five songs to.
Give to them so i put out space what.
Because for me i want i thought space.
Cuz i was just like it's important for.
Me and then i put down and i thought.
Okay island do you want to take this not.
Know otherwise like now we're not gonna.
Take that one.
And then the whole dish strikes.
Happening right right and then i made an.
Ep of that i know like yeah we'll take.
This uh-huh because i saw the bars and.
They're like oh yeah we can capitalize.
On this yeah i think so i it's actually.
Crazy i can't like put little boy in my.
Video else i'll get claimed on it oh.
Sorry i sold all my discharge i can't.
Like use what they actually own the song.
Yeah yeah yes it's a bit annoying wow.
Yeah labels well you you mentioned diss.
Tracks and i this was something that you.
Know it is older drama but it's kind of.
A it's what really brought a lot of eyes.
You know to you and your music and stuff.
So you had diss tracks with like sideman.
And stuff yes and that was huge you know.
There's a lot of heat between it and you.
You made a video where it talks about it.
Was all real right yes and uh i guess.
How do you cuz there's a lot of internet.
Drama that goes on between people so how.
Do you solve that off-camera you know.
Because these are your friends and stuff.
And you guys did end up settling it i.
Think it's it's time time like like with.
Me and harry it was a bit cagey like.
Especially after his second decide on me.
Like i was pissed yeah now one is just.
Legitimately yeah so like you guys are.
Just exaggerating we are friends right.
But like the stuff we say is real like.
Everything we're saying it's like truth.
So it still like sucks right i got you.
Well i said like it took some time to.
Like go over that boy that's nice issue.
It's just time who extended the olive.
Branch like who was the first one to be.
Like oh that's not a saint yeah like a.
Peace thing got it got it i think it's.
Just it's just a thing that just.
Happened because obviously we do videos.
Together so we have to eventually like.
Sort out we couldn't have can just be.
Enemies forever yeah you and logan never.
Become friends who would you be more.
Friends with logan or jake that's like.
Cocaine before jake.
Come on that's it wait so you're are you.
Are you fighting jake no i'm fine logan.
Okay because i saw something i didn't i.
Was just trolling oh okay yeah so i was.
Just trying to be like on the yj because.
Logan's falling off of this right i was.
Always in the fallopian like yeah we've.
Literally been training to fight logan.
Right why would you just switch it to.
Fight jake but yeah i know well i mean i.
I mean you already talked about like.
Your beef that you had with the simon.
And stuff but i always wondered i mean.
We talked about it last time you were.
Here but um just i mean i to a certain.
Degree how real is that like how much do.
You not like each other i just i see.
Somewhat me enlighten yeah i think it's.
More like an ego thing like oh see he.
Did the whole forest thing but it's like.
Precise i don't really have any real.
Like anger towards him i think it's more.
Just to show that i'm better than him.
Right right yeah like even though he's.
Had all of this all of the athletic.
Background and you know he thinks he's.
Mr. tough man i'm there like even after.
Your slice well no yeah go first yeah.
You're fine so we have this so we could.
Just be ourselves like even your fight.
That's why afterwards like he said he.
Talked about how he messed up and then.
The fight kind of like you know gave him.
An opportunity to reinvent himself and.
He gave a lot of credit to you and then.
When his dog died like you were like a.
Man like sorry to hear about it so it's.
Not like you guys have like it's not.
Like you're like ha good for you you're.
Not the worst for you some people are.
Like that like i am human as well yeah.
Right who's your dog it's like losing a.
Baby yeah it hurt so i'm not gonna just.
Be like how you did your dog died low.
Yeah i exact it's just stupid it's just.
It's inhumane so you know i was just.
Like and so you got a soft side then.
It's just being.
Empathy isn't it like yeah yeah just.
Certain things like you've gotta be like.
Okay oh sorry so like and i don't mean.
To bring it back to the music but this.
Is something i was like interested in.
Stuff because i wanted to continue like.
You had the beef with the seidman and.
Everything and then you had a beef with.
Logan and you had his dish track towards.
Him for the fight and then you had a.
Diss track with quad deca hmm and you.
Guys were popping off on each other.
Alive yeah and then when new age got.
Released he was actually on a track with.
You which a lot before he wasn't on the.
Trouble man he's gonna travel randolph.
Oh see i'm not on it.
Oh you just didn't want to do it but so.
The beef there's it's pretty real i mean.
It's still kind of heated it's not it's.
Like i think we both respect each other.
But it's more like we think we think.
Also like we think we're better than the.
Other so it's essentially like you and.
Logan but now in rapping table yeah kind.
Of seems like writers like the way.
Fighters interact with each other yeah.
They have respect for each other and.
What they do they weren't fighting each.
Other it would be you know respect to.
You but i'm so better than you that's.
That's what it's like it's really okay.
Right it's not at that conor mcgregor.
Level of like i'm gonna throw up.
He would laugh at the dog dying yeah.
Like i feel like you put a tweet out you.
Like a little too far but i mean it draw.
It if you pulling back the punches now.
Just what what about jake i mean i.
Haven't completely followed every detail.
And i only see headlines you know like i.
Don't know that for details like what.
About jay is so much worse he's just.
He's actually a    like yeah i know.
Like he's actually about person like.
Logan.
Right logan i mean jake is an actual.
Like prick he's an actual bad person.
Like his whole demeanor everything about.
Him just stinks man and i just don't.
Like it.
And is it toward a direct interaction.
That you had with him like between me.
And him between just my people around us.
Like no none of my friends liked him.
Like some of my friends are still like.
Logan right even though i'd find him.
They still like like yeah it is like.
This somehow no one likes jake jake i've.
Never met him.
So i can't and i never i don't wanna say.
Anything cuz i never met him i've never.
Met him either.
When i met logan honestly it was and i.
Said this before it was only once and it.
Was short but he was seem like a normal.
Dude like he didn't wasn't like acting.
The way he does in videos and stuff.
Um-hmm but i don't know i i don't know.
I'm well enough but that's interesting.
You have real beef with jake that's in a.
More logical foot i mean are you guys.
Alright so pretty much the plan is once.
I get through logan through drink was.
Logan tricks that it wasn't logan and.
Drake like talking or something though.
You know jake and drake oh my god drake.
And jake yeah so now you gotta fight.
Drake definitely yeah and you got our.
Rap in one round you guys are fighting.
That's a good title for the fight there.
Are some punches she pitch it to him oh.
I guess cut i guess i'm good at one all.
Right now taking oh man that is uh well.
That i didn't know i didn't know i even.
Though i know you i mean that's not.
Something we've ever talked about but i.
Didn't know that that paid as well so.
Yeah i didn't really see that i mean i.
Know you guys were having issues and.
Stuff and yeah yeah i mean my bow.
She's you guys good oh we're good now.
Yeah we saw that in some of their videos.
Like they bet they do together or.
Whatever like he'll straight-up punch.
Dead you like to punch him in the arm.
With nettie.
He'll punch him in the stomach and he's.
Just like you know it's like oh you can.
Get away oh brotherly love at the time.
Of his life.
Oh really living it it's nice right yeah.
Okay well we established it all that.
Stuff is real i'm coming from another.
Perspective really follow everything but.
I'm just and i know behind the scenes a.
Lot you tubers are over i mean not that.
It's fake i mean there is fake a lot of.
Fake stuff too.
Yes but a lot of the drama and stuff.
It's kind of mutually understanding like.
This is working for us both yeah so.
Let's i mean you know it's like oh it's.
Like two fighters like let's melt this.
Yeah i kind of struggle to do like fake.
Things the answers yes then i call it.
Just doesn't feel authentic right right.
I don't know i can't really lie put my.
All into it where ever it's real and i.
Can just go to freaking moon and just go.
Ahead and so but i guess i guess what i.
Was leading to you because you are a.
Personality you know a lot of youtubers.
Are like oh i'm a tech youtuber or i'm a.
Diy you know and and they try to you.
Know eventually their personal and.
Personality comes out but you've always.
Been just like this is me that's just.
Yeah raw genuine like because when i.
Started just going back all the way back.
I start with fifa i was just like oh my.
Gosh like i i don't want to do it fee.
For the whole of my life like i'm.
Eventually gonna get bored and then what.
So i always made that an important thing.
To words and the point thing for me.
You're a good rapper and for me.
Was to make sure that i showed my.
Personality through all my content so.
I'd always not just do the same thing i.
Do other things like music acting skits.
And with just all other games always.
Just trying to show people like oh this.
Is me like you know get used to me so.
That me so that in the future whenever i.
Wanted to do anything i'd be able to.
Just do it and be like oh    yeah.
What's he doing next okay that's cool i.
Got to do this so speaking about future.
I mean like what i mean like you said.
You're into so many different things but.
Uh what is uh i mean what's next i mean.
Not next actually there's a lot of.
Things coming up but like what's like.
Future what's end goal um is it ideally.
Music it seems like um well there's.
Quite a few things like i like to say.
I'm like jack of all trades but master.
Of none.
Oh damn that's the first time you've.
Ever dissed yourselves exclusive in.
Person yeah there's quite a few things i.
Want to do so at the moment i'm doing.
Like little skits on my main channel.
Just i guess get my audience prepared.
For what like ready from to see me.
Acting that make sense just to see like.
For them to get comfortable with me.
Acting and you know eventually i want.
You know to improve the content make it.
Better and better and better so.
Eventually in the future this could be.
Like a year two three years i can create.
My own movie right so that's one of my.
Angles to do that but i know like it to.
Make a movie you know takes so much like.
Four and there's so many things you have.
To deal with i'm nowhere near that point.
So i'm like let me start with just.
Little like 10 15 minutes skits and.
Eventually create a movie through that.
Music i want to obviously do my own.
Album but i know with the album join.
Amor me and ran off like that's cool.
But it's like okay.
I want to take my oven to the next level.
But for me to get to that part i still.
Need to i guess prove myself i feel like.
Well i mean like i feel like i proven.
Myself i mean like prove myself.
Musically like show that i am like on.
Another level right if i miss i mean.
Your albums did i mean it did well.
Though yeah isn't that it proof to.
Yourself - oh yeah i mean it's it's i.
Know i already know i'm sick.
There we go confidence back where you.
Went why it's like i i need a literary.
Show people and it's just like sharing.
People with different ways and.
Eventually once my album comes out.
People be like oh my god like holy crap.
He is a monster so that's that's my plan.
With that with the boxing fight logan.
Fight jake and then do a pro fight and.
Then just go from there trying to a pro.
Fight yeah yeah i think i'll be sick so.
Just train up for that and obviously.
Side men as well do side men videos a.
Lot of things yeah so much time and.
Energy in the day i mean that is i mean.
You've been doing it though that's it.
Like yeah like pretty much most of my.
Life it's just been this so yeah it's.
Just like you just keep going and just.
See see what happens so yeah i just i.
Know for me it's a it's exciting but.
It's not easy it's it's if anything it's.
Stressful.
I've had several breakdowns off-camera.
You saying.
Well what do you mean breakdowns in.
Terms of what oh just wanting to quit.
Things.
Oh no no just like mentally like oh my.
God like i can't do this i'm doing too.
Much oh my god this is crazy bah bah bah.
But uh my girlfriend is lit you been.
Like so helpful throughout through my.
Years essentially helping me out so yeah.
It she she she's just calm me down.
Several times and i just put up put up.
With me as well because i i'm a bit of a.
Handful.
But now she's been seized she's been.
Amazing and she's always amazing so yeah.
She's helped me loads of that i guess uh.
To follow up on that when you say yeah.
Like mental breakdowns cuz you almost.
Seem like somebody who like would never.
Have that you know oh yeah hundred.
Percent like so for you to say there's.
Like scum something completely that you.
Would have never fathom oh yeah i think.
I mean i don't know how often i haven't.
Seen everything you've been in so i.
Don't know is that something you talked.
About or oh no no no i never talked.
About yeah and that's why why i don't.
Know i i'm just like i guess maybe it's.
Maybe people might want to hear about.
I'm just for me i'm sure like i'd like i.
Don't need to put this on them yeah yeah.
Alright let me just do what i'm doing.
And show that i'm you know it's still.
Alright you still doing well yeah and if.
I do freak out or if i have a mental.
Breakdown i just do it off camera you.
Know behind closed doors.
No one's affected nothing happens i yeah.
I don't get there oh you know i'm there.
For you blah both not like no not simply.
These stuff i'm just there like this is.
Yeah this is what i'm doing etc and just.
Leave it at that yeah i respect that.
Yeah yeah i just it's kind of like why.
Would i put my burden on someone else.
And i sense a lot of people especially.
On youtube use that for themselves yeah.
Yeah yeah i guess it's not really my.
Thing.
Yeah i mean i don't think there's any.
Right or wrong yeah it's just.
Interesting for us to hear yeah.
Especially like you said you're ultra.
Saw you know he came with gifts today a.
Bunch of waters i know i'm such a good.
Guy man between each round he's like is.
Everybody hydrated i'm just telling.
People down human no yeah.
Like i'm not like superman i'm right i.
Mean i i i've seen a decent amount of.
Your videos hmm and i think this right.
Now is probably the most human that.
You've ever looked on camera okay so in.
A long time you know so to see this is.
Very different and it's very interesting.
It's very unique that they get to see.
This side of you and it's almost like.
You know wow he's not like just this.
Egotistical god who's like just laughing.
At everything like like it's crazy.
Because like literally every podcast i.
Go on they all say the same thing they.
Always like when i went on chat mates.
And he was like oh i thought you'd give.
Me a       yeah he was just like.
I thought i was expecting to be an.
Absolute.
Yeah but you're just down to a normal.
Guy i was like yeah i want to go that.
Far i wanna go but i it's just like i.
Don't know i.
Yeah i don't know i just whenever the.
Cameras on i'm just like whatever it's.
Like it is what it is they're trying to.
Be entertaining yeah yeah i don't like.
That right yeah i know for me there.
Isn't really a wall logic to what i do i.
Kind of just do and it just works i.
Guess.
Gotten you this far that's what people.
Like you're just doing whatever comes to.
Your mind that's it like it's great it's.
Crazy like people just so like screw it.
So my bro says he does everything for.
The fans like he's like he lets the fans.
I guide him right where to go and for me.
I'm like that's a terabyte you two have.
Like yeah you know my fans are cool and.
All that but i did youtube for me.
Essentially i did youtube to just well.
Just because i thought i wanted to make.
Entertaining videos and the people like.
It cool people don't like it all right.
Yeah like it's just it's it's my life.
Essentially like i always feel like i i.
Don't want to be led by people if i make.
Sense i always want to just lead.
By my siddeley leave myself into what.
Direction i want to go in and i i feel.
Like it's it's what what yeah i mean i.
Think that's like to me that's what i.
Think is the secret to longevity yeah on.
Youtube or any any platform because then.
You're doing it for yourself exactly i.
Can relate to your brother in that i.
Used to the reason i'm doing this.
Podcast is because i had to figure out i.
Had my own version of a mental breakdown.
Yeah i was like man i keep making these.
Same skits and i'm like i know people.
Like them and people think they're smart.
But i'm so sick of it like it's not that.
I don't want to make skits anymore just.
I got so tired of doing the same thing i.
Just wanted to do something more real.
Yeah so i mean that's why i want to do.
This and it's super-new only dude and i.
Knew i was gonna suffer in terms of like.
Viewership and stuff but like it's the.
Only way i could have continued it's not.
Like losing my mind.
Ya know so i think that's why you're.
Able i mean you've been around like free.
When did you start youtube i think was.
On 2010 2010 a long time started yeah.
Right like i mean i'm not gonna count it.
Like yeah i asked seven videos of.
Churches was in school just played fifa.
Seven i just posted that i'd say i did.
It properly around like 2010 he took it.
Serious that's what i wanted to really.
Go home on this so yeah look how far.
You've come in and now you're fighting.
Logan the thing is like that was huge.
Though oh my - nice to meet you just.
Coming yeah like i just come and i just.
Grasp it yes that's pretty much how.
Essentially i'm at this point like.
Whenever i see ya an opportunity i'm.
They're like yeah i'm going you know.
Smashing through that and just gonna.
Obliterate it and it's annoying i didn't.
Be logan because i was like oh this is.
Gonna work then i can do this bah bah.
Bah but i mean we just got tattoos wrong.
So make sure also you injured your hand.
Right or something all right.
Yeah why lose like it wasn't too bad.
Like it's just like just the left a bit.
I was kind of shocked how much bigger he.
Looked.
Yeah you know he's huge dude he's a big.
Guy yeah like both he's so he's like i.
Fled it background yeah yeah it fully.
Shows so yeah that's why we we do we.
Didn't even expect the stance we didn't.
Expect anything before he was just gonna.
Be conventional and he just switched on.
Us so we're like alright cool right so.
We need to make sure we cover all bases.
Now and that's what we're doing.
Are you still training with we're down.
No i'm trying i'm training with another.
Trainer leone okay out here.
I know so he he sometimes trains in.
Vegas yeah but uh right now he's.
Training in the uk and he's got a fine.
Tube i think i believe next week yeah so.
We bring a lot of boxers up in here but.
I i think i just want to follow up with.
One thing before we take this gg break.
Yeah.
And just talking about the longevity of.
Your career because uh in the beginning.
Like you're really popping off you know.
A lot of your videos did really well.
Harlem shake.
Definitely and then you took this long.
Break mmm you know to kind of focus on.
Your music and stuff mm-hmm.
Do you feel like that kind of helped.
Regain your sanity or whatever you need.
It yeah and 100 100 100 percent.
Literally thought 2017 break like.
Essentially saved my whole career like.
With everything because i was just.
Knowing a good spot i was i was just.
Doing old types of things yo i went to.
Where like oh i wasn't romania to see a.
Girl like that's just crazy for me like.
And i only met her like once and this.
Isn't uk and then i flew all the way to.
Romania in like not even like the.
Capital some like random area brush off.
And literally just to see and just day.
Her and i was like.
After outside what's wrong with me like.
I'm literally just no i thought i just.
Didn't feel like right with myself and.
Eventually i just you know time to just.
Travel find myself oh my god find myself.
But it's something you have to do and.
Eventually like you know i home did.
Mycroft i figured out what do i want to.
Do with my life and i was like okay i've.
Got it all figured out and then just.
Things happened and it just wiped.
Perfectly and and what is i guess what.
Is one thing that like your eureka.
Moment that hits you you know was there.
A specific moment where like i know what.
I need to do or this is where i regained.
My sanity i think time just the break.
And time was the best thing for me me.
Just separating myself from social media.
And everything and just you know just.
Being with myself i think was the best.
Thing and if it took six months for me.
To be like okay i'm good now but i feel.
Like it was necessary like it's just one.
Of those things like if you're so social.
Media this this data and it's just it's.
Just too much and i was just not happy.
With like my content i wasn't happy with.
Where my music was i wasn't happy with.
Just everything i was just i just hate.
Like what i was at the time and now i'm.
Just so happy and i feel right now i.
Understand it more and now i know when.
To take a break now i know okay.
I've been going ham i need to just relax.
Here for a bit and you know i do have.
Those times where i just don't go on.
Social media and i just you know just.
Relax and i feel like that's just.
Important i feel like yeah time and just.
Separate yourself from this whole social.
Media buzz is important yeah that's a.
Brave thing i mean being a especially if.
You're doing well you know online and.
Suddenly in anything for like even.
Instagramers everybody when you're on.
That wave it's really hard to justify.
I'm sure you can relate i'm gonna take a.
Break especially.
Know how long you renting that yeah.
Exactly it's it's a scary decision to be.
Like i am going to i mean you never know.
If you fall off you're never coming back.
So that's that's it but i feel like even.
If i did fall off i would have just.
Still don't usually not just being a.
Happier place but for me it's not like.
Oh i need get this mile views and you.
Get this this that that right for me.
It's like okay i want to make this type.
Of content and make it this good and i.
Want to put this out and you know i.
Won't make a track like this or i want.
To you know put something out like this.
Like it's just for me like i just like.
My music videos i just spend like this.
Stupid amounts i think when allah i.
Spent like 90,000 pounds on yeah and i.
Think the videos on like 2.8 million.
Views and like people look at that like.
Well that was a flop but for me i was.
Like now i'd like that's exactly why i.
Wanted to put a video out like that.
Right and i wanted to spend that much on.
Something like that because for me it.
Was sick it was and that's what i mean.
Like for me i just want to make sick.
Stuff and do sick stuff right for me.
It's it's never been about the money.
It's always just about me enjoying what.
I'm doing and i feel like a lot of.
People just get caught up with the views.
And the stats and all this and that yeah.
It's good to always just separate.
Yourself from that and just be like okay.
Today i want to just make this type of.
Content made this type of song etc and.
Just you know enjoy it that's it like.
That's youtube is all about for me.
Having fun and if you're having fun and.
What's the point exactly.
Yeah but like i told you i mean i'm sure.
He liked your you understand as well.
That's that's what i was doing even you.
Know and i get it - i was like okay this.
Works so i'm gonna keep doing it yeah.
And it's it's a safe spot ya know.
Especially if you see views dropped and.
All of a sudden like okay i got to do.
Even more stuff i don't just lucky if it.
Happens to be something like what you.
Did you found what you wanted to do and.
Luckily that is something everybody.
Wanted as well yeah i think that kind of.
Comes through with i mean that's that's.
Great for you people just like you for.
You yeah you could be doing almost.
Anything.
Yeah you sure they'd be watching yeah.
Which is.
Yeah but just puts me in a really nice.
Spot and yeah i'm forever grateful but.
You know ultimately i'm just gonna just.
Keep doing me and we're gonna call them.
Soft jj's emotional one do we need to.
Take a shishi break yeah we're gonna dig.
His cheesy break-in then after that.
We'll discuss him fighting dex.
Quick she break let's clap again and.
We're back you should put that part in.
I'm going i always put the claps in now.
The second half i do.
Oh cuz sometimes we say dumb stuff sorry.
That was a longer break than usual that.
Was not a shishi break that was a.
Horrible though this was kind of a.
Shishi break for me pretty sure i had.
Food poisoning last night sorry guys um.
Yeah so where did we leave off we left.
Off talking about uh you know boxing and.
What he wanted to do in his future plans.
What'd you think i was gonna say darks.
Yeah that's what that is what text.
That's kind of like it's good you don't.
Know no really i mean i throw when i.
Hate well if you want to explain a.
Little bit more yeah i don't in your.
Community that's kind of like a really.
Big joke yeah yeah it's just he's.
Becoming me so essentially he's just.
This rapper.
Cult acts he wants to fight me.
Physically yeah okay.
Was he big i don't even know yeah i.
Don't know it's like way old sighs he's.
Ripped i'll give him that.
But he thinks he could beat me in a box.
In my she's six-foot - fix it - okay so.
He's fairly tall yeah i think he thinks.
He could beat me in the boxing match.
And i'm like what if he's really good no.
No i've seen i've seen him like punch.
Okay and no no do you only starch i mean.
You were boxing even before all this.
Started happening right or did you just.
Start wars all right all right.
That weller joe willis yeah were you.
Boxing before the fool not no literally.
Started when i was meant to fight joella.
Uh-huh what how did that even come to i.
Mean i remember scene i was like oh this.
Is brilliant uh long story short i he.
Fought someone else is one of his mates.
And i put it as a joke uh i'll fight the.
Winner and then he took that seriously.
And then that's how you said it you said.
Something else you must have made it.
More no that's lily yeah and as you saw.
Like oh yeah yeah fight me then let's go.
Let's go.
And i said no it's a joke claire i don't.
Want you want to fight you and he's like.
No no no and then we had a whole press.
Conference and then they go ahead and.
Right if i happen so yeah and that was.
Real too i was impressed cause that.
Wasn't planned i was very real for me.
It's like because i know you you know i.
Mean so when i see these videos and.
Stuff like i don't know he'll be asking.
Me and stuff i'm be like i i don't know.
I'm gonna ask you that's not how i.
Usually i got the one with the head the.
Fire i mean the press conference right.
Especially like that girl yes so like it.
Was like it was a right between me and.
Him but it wasn't because like we more.
Like friends friends but you know we.
Knew of each other we different deals.
Together and then it just not personal.
It just turned mine like he just you.
Know switch something to try and i guess.
Just ruin room my career essentially i.
Know i just call it so angry and then i.
Just like lost my    and i just went.
Red i am caught so angry to the point.
Where i was trying to like grab him like.
Hurt him.
Yeah so because he pushed me he did no.
He nudged into me and i just as i do.
What the    are you doing.
We're meant to just have this press.
Conference and then box didn't leave her.
At that but he just you know took it way.
Farther with like what was said and why.
He's the what he did.
I just lost my    to the point where.
One of the bodyguards tried stopping me.
And i threw him across the stage and.
Just ripped his suit the body goes yeah.
Fully ripped it and then they got more.
And more people just to hold me back.
And i thought boy i was like i'm going.
To do this man i mean yeah yeah for.
Tomorrow i think is the referee stopped.
Early yeah it was taken who started the.
Side men who stir so it it kind of its.
Kind of just for former side man i.
Didn't make sure you this right it's me.
Simon josh and ethan yeah no no i'm toby.
So it was all well pretty much we.
Started the gta group and we were just.
Like i we should just make videos.
Together why why this would be good so i.
Think at the time there was another.
Group and we were just i wish she'd do.
Something similar it was it was do you.
Know like speedy and them all right so.
Those youtubers i forgot what the group.
Is called but they had like a little.
Group and like oh yeah we should just do.
Something similar so we had that and i.
Think then vic wanted to join vic was.
Quite interested so he did a few videos.
With him and we weren't called the.
Seidman at this point we were just doing.
Videos together and then we i think it's.
So long ago um.
So harry was in the community but he.
Wasn't like like we knew of him but we.
Were told by another youtuber i don't.
Know if i should be saying this.
Oh    it's not it's not too bad it's.
Not too bad it's not too bad.
We were told by another youtuber knapp.
To pretty much take harry under our wing.
We take harry under our wing because he.
Was going down like a bad rule with.
Other youtubers which i won't say who.
But he was going down a bad route with.
Another other couple of youtubers so.
Knapp was like oh you should definitely.
Like put her in your group just you know.
To steer him in the right direction so.
We're like yeah yeah sure we'll do it.
And you know he was steve's jokes you.
Know we divisions with him and.
Eventually just like i would you know we.
Should call ourselves something and um.
Yeah we decide seidman was pretty jokes.
Like just seidman is kind of like an.
Insult it's not anymore it's right now.
It's like it's crazy like you'd you get.
Rapped it's always like calling like it.
Would be an insult to cool someone aside.
Man okay so you have rappers always be.
Saying like my mind's aside manland or.
Your side man this this that you know.
I'm the main man your side my neck.
Cetera it's now no no rapper says it.
Because of us later because if so many.
Need something else now yeah but.
Literally it's like if you mean the side.
Menu like oh wait you mean the youtube.
Group sorry it doesn't work it doesn't.
Work is watching more so it's crazy so.
We're literally turning the word the.
Insole into just just our group name now.
But um yeah we decided to just call.
Ourselves the side man this we thought.
It just be jokes like well assignment of.
Each other's of each other just what i.
Said she's just dissing each other and.
Yeah over time we just just grew and.
Grew and grew and it's crazy yo the.
Simon almost like wasn't a thing i think.
Is around 2017 is legend when i when i.
Left.
During that whole period like the.
Sidemen were just like oh just in limbo.
Right like you know simon and josh and.
Toby and a few others.
We're still doing videos.
You know did a few simon videos here in.
Nab like gta and etc but it was like.
Getting to a point where we were like i.
Was might have to and this some point.
Died say yeah just like move on from.
This whole simon thing and then the.
Whole dish strikes happened and then.
From then it was like a huge boom but.
After that we were like okay we're back.
To you know the point where we were.
Before.
Right like yeah we've got all these.
Views but it's like what do we do is.
Each other like what's what's going on.
And the thing that saved the sideman was.
A youtube originals youtuber youtuber.
Original saves the sideman because.
Because of you two originals we needed.
We had this seidman channel but we.
Didn't we hardly ever posted any content.
Uh-huh we didn't have the symbol we have.
Where we have now we post every single.
Week we just had a thing where we would.
Just post like charity matches and.
That's pretty much it and just you know.
What i was pretty yeah that's pretty.
Much it we didn't really post anything.
Else so we we had the salmon channel.
Like okay you two were like you guys.
Need to have more traffic on this.
Channel for us to like do this side man.
Originals series so okay we have to.
Think of a plan so we're thinking okay.
What would work and we decided would do.
Videos together every week and post it.
Every sunday at the start of 2018 just.
To get some traffic right you know onto.
The channel and you know over time it.
Just popped off like it got bigger and.
Bigger and bigger and then youtube.
Originals happened and now it's like i.
Was alright it didn't really do much but.
We gained so much from it not through.
The views of the u2 original like the.
Youtube regions didn't really do much.
For us.
But the stuff around it that helped so.
It made us do videos every sunday right.
Hey gosh like a rotor you know it goes.
Our.
Paso manager to like so all of like.
Stuff it just got a six lead in the.
Group we kind of all take charge that's.
The political answer no no no we always.
Take charge like take turns because it's.
All like he could like the shares equal.
Everybody just gets the exact same out.
So we all have to pull our weight yeah.
So sometimes you're so on this and.
Pulling that weight we just get on them.
And we're just like yo you know put that.
Weight and then they'll pull that weight.
And then that's it and saw it yeah how.
Does a large group like that cuz wrong i.
Think from what i've heard i could be.
Wrong.
Everybody has to come up with a video.
Idea yeah well and they're in charge of.
That we kind of we kind of come together.
And we think of ideas and so yeah some.
People are better ideas than others but.
We were like i you know for me i had an.
Idea to do it in the video real-life -.
In the video where us seven side men.
We're in the line and we have a girl.
Several girls come in and they would.
Just rate us so they would like swipe.
Right or swipe left and if they swipe.
Left.
We asked them why and we thought it'd be.
Funny just you know see what reason for.
Why girls would want to swipe swipe left.
To us think so it's so like just stuff.
Like that and then i'll just set it all.
Up i'm you know make sure the studios.
Are sawing tanya who's our personal.
Manager helps so much she is literally.
The rock in the side man like she just.
Makes sure makes everything work without.
Her we just be all over the place so she.
Is like the best and we got her from the.
Youtube originals she was already she's.
Working with a company that was working.
With the whole you to originals and we.
Were just like yo like do you want to be.
Our personal manager and she's four by.
It it's just like    it let's go let's.
See what happens and now she's like over.
The moon.
And yeah like just stuff like that's.
Well that's that's probably partly why.
The sidemen is just thriving like and.
Why were in just such a good position.
And it's crazy like in 2017 we were.
Close to like just ending it yeah yeah.
That's crazy.
It's something that like seems so small.
It's just like the catalyst for like.
Great yeah youtubers who will follow.
Youtube originals yeah save the seidman.
They're gonna take that quote and like.
Use it out of everything like we did.
This you're welcome but they can't use.
This you know because then you can.
Copyright strike them yeah.
Monetization i wouldn't be surprised if.
This gets copyright actually i that's.
That's an interesting thing.
Copyright monetization copywriting.
Things and monetization because both of.
You guys your demographics are that's a.
Pretty different and the content that.
You put out is very different you're a.
Lot edgier yeah i yeah ryan is is more.
Safe you know like on the fence and.
Stuff um how do you deal with.
Monetization on things cuz without the i.
Dare you that we all did together you.
Just said that guide to monetize right.
It i well first i think it got age.
Restricted and then i mean a lot of the.
Ideas i mean i get it because it's like.
Now they're trying to say like if.
Anything that is considered dangerous.
Even though we have a disclaimer in the.
Beginning i mean they're just looking.
Out for themselves.
Mmm yeah but um well i like so i have.
Two channels on my main channel i don't.
Really get to monetize or claimed much.
Because a lot of content there now it's.
Just original stuff and i we make sure.
Like there's no like operates yeah but.
You like swear and you're just like yeah.
It's i think i doesn't get to monetize.
Though like i think um so i think.
Swearing is alright if it's you know.
Like - if it's not too crazy and i think.
Youtube definitely like the whole skits.
And like music when it comes to music.
And skits they're quite lenient yeah.
Whereas my second channel i've.
Like i get destroyed yeah i because i'm.
Just like myself and youtube they're.
Like nope s'alright don't be yourself.
Yeah yeah i do.
One question go i get to monetize and.
You know like i do reaction videos and i.
Get copyright claims and the monetize so.
It's literally like it's hard to like.
Make any money on my second channel i.
Like i just that's what the second.
Channel for yeah it's just waiting out.
Stuff i just want i just want to just do.
Like and i feel like for me it just.
Makes so much sense i it just works in.
My head to have like premium content on.
My main channel and in my second term i.
Can just sit back and just not care and.
Just do a    out one right so i think.
It's just like ai just white's me so.
Well no we know yeah we need to swear.
And not be ourselves and do original.
Things do original things there's a.
Second channel we just got to start.
Dropping bombs.
I know get more that's so inconsistent.
Though cuz yeah i heard that i don't.
Really get like we get but like even.
Like in the negative right now if you.
Have homeless oh this is like fake set.
Yes all green screen after this we have.
To go to the strip we have to put on our.
Homeless gear by the way you have any.
Extra dollars for us oh pound sorry.
Euros whatever take anything what your.
Scraps dude wherever you're going.
Tonight.
Lose your food oh i will for you'd be.
Like untouched ah a lot of stuff got.
Claimed is it just like copyright claims.
There's some call a lot of a lot of.
Copyright claim from previous like stuff.
In the past yeah pretty good about that.
Now yeah we have to be you know and a.
Lot of things like is it's it's.
Debatable and i could you know maybe.
Fight it but it's like it's such a.
Process yeah you know at that point i'm.
Just like i'm just gonna stop doing that.
But yeah i mean i get it a lot and then.
I heard i mean that had a title once.
Where it has like f asterisk asterisk.
Asterisk in it mmm and that gets like oh.
It's demonetised yeah and it's old video.
Even a podcast that had m om oh oh yeah.
Oh yeah yeah well because when that was.
Going on we talked about it we're not.
Promoting it because the title that.
Podcast got like instantly did yeah yeah.
I don't even think it was a person it's.
Just the system yeah yugi would just.
Turn the cover there oh yeah yeah all.
Those type of things i see their.
Perspective because people are coming at.
Them but they're it's i think if they.
Keep going down this path it's just.
Gonna ruin it i think it's gonna be so.
Boring all the contents gonna be so.
Tense 'red yeah yeah it's crazy like.
Compared to like where youtube was years.
Ago is now it's it's if anything it's.
Becoming really like tv yeah yeah with.
The censorship and what you can and.
Can't say right well when money gets.
Involved then people start caring about.
This that's a all right well i mean we.
Had a really good talk so far so why.
Don't we include some audience questions.
We have twitter question oh yeah.
So we have some twitter questions if you.
Guys have any questions for future guess.
You can always follow us at off the pill.
On twitter or on instagram at off the.
Pill podcast so a comment or yeah or.
Leave a comment oh one of the questions.
That we have from twitter today is from.
Two cents spencer which is kiss i what.
Does the team look like creating your.
Videos is it just you you and an editor.
Give us a picture what would you mean.
Well because like you you kind of have.
Like different people for different.
Stuff like you worked with randolph.
Right here the cameraman and then you.
Also have con yeah and then who edits.
Like you edit i mean there was one video.
I one video no two videos i've edited.
This year and usually you can kind of.
Tell which ones there were so the t food.
Versus ninja i added that and that to me.
Like through three days it's like.
Edit.
Is a long process so she's away i had it.
I'm just so particular and it just.
Doesn't work for like especially with.
The second channel because then your.
Daily almost and what one your job yeah.
I've slowed down a bit just because.
Things have just got really really busy.
But you get really hung over.
I just use as an excuse i was just there.
Like yeah i just got too much going on.
I'm still okay i'm all over guys sorry.
Oh my i go after we yeah but uh yeah.
What if like yeah so i i have various.
People so i've been who shoots certain.
Types of videos so he does quite a few.
Well he does most my skits sometimes he.
Does music videos i've gone he does my.
Music videos and he also does like simon.
Videos i also have me i guess i film.
Myself when i just chuck the hardest -.
Yeah i ask for me yeah the most work but.
Uh besides that no i don't i don't.
Really have any other i i mean how many.
Editors diab usually just one yeah i've.
Just just like i was crazy i mean like.
Remained my main channel like if i was.
To do a music video like i don't have.
Different random editors for that but.
It's like i'm mind control of that at.
Uncon and been so i've combed once the.
Edit he whether if condos weren't out.
There he'll find someone else to edit.
And say my bed so and how do you uh i.
Guess how do you have you how did you.
Get into working relationship with all.
These people here literally just through.
Just youtube just mutual i literally.
Like everyone we meet it's just all.
Natural it's just i i never go out or.
Reach out to people unless i'm dead like.
Yo we have to do something so with.
Quackity i don't know if you know crack.
Is he is but he's a youtuber who i look.
To his video sounds like this guy's.
And his videos are so well edited i have.
To do something with him so i reached.
Out to him and did something with him.
And it's not like i was like ah i wanted.
Now you have to do a video for my.
Channel but i just did a video for him.
And he put on this channel and that was.
It and i just left and he hit me up.
Saying like if you ever need me you know.
Just holler.
And i was like yeah cool like of course.
You know i'll let you know but it's like.
I'm never a guy who's just like ah you.
Know you i scratch your back you scratch.
Mine.
Like i need to get something from for.
Doing something i'm there like if i.
Think you're you're sick is held and i'm.
Gonna do something with you so where was.
I going with that that was good that's.
Very that came a lot from one question.
But that's good we got a lot of we got.
More another side of you yeah just do it.
For you because he doesn't expect.
Anything in return good guy i'm just.
Kidding yeah i mean you came out and you.
Kicked the cactus for me and we didn't.
Even we filmed the video today yeah yeah.
I guess yeah you came all the vegas but.
It's like sleeping for my channel yes i.
Was like damn thank you you have to do.
It welcome to london eventually yes i.
Haven't actually i've been all over.
We're not all over but is there any i.
Guess places uk like conventions or.
Anything.
Damn i get a lot of enquiries like josh.
Trey leah and southeast asia india even.
But not that many from the u and we have.
A decent viewership out there but we.
Have we have a vidcon in the uk yeah and.
I guess the final twitter question is.
From andy tien it's better be a good one.
Andy who it is as oh jeez of youtube.
Oh how difficult old was it to.
Transition to a different kind of.
Content from the one you've started with.
We talked about that i mean you did.
Right it's going does mommy did fifa yes.
I saw a fever and then i was just like i.
Don't be doing fifa with my life's i.
Just i mean you have to be a bit more.
Tactical with it you have to like slowly.
Feed in all the content to the point i'd.
Still like release the main content that.
You're putting out just so people like.
Oh what are you doing no this is all.
Like no go back to what you're used to.
But i yeah a lot of time you just have.
To ignore people like people always.
Gonna say    until eventually like.
They just go away or you just find new.
Audience yeah love both things that.
You're doing and then you find an.
Audience i love all the things that you.
Like you want to do etc so and i think.
For you because they're there for your.
Personality yeah so you know it doesn't.
Really mother yeah they're there for you.
No matter you could watch paint dry and.
Make that exciting no it's true.
Yeah that's just your person on and.
That's something that you have like that.
You're one of your talents you've.
Definitely grown that and push that side.
Of you yes i feel like just youtube has.
Slight helped tremendously with that.
Yeah over the time look just.
You always charismatic as ago no i was.
Very into red really extremely.
Introverted as you were when you were.
Growing up yes i mean i didn't talk to.
Girls like i remember there was a time i.
Think it was like yeah what year was it.
Year 12 so i was around 16 17 i think so.
18 and a go came a girl just walk past.
Me and i really liked her so i said hi.
And she said hi back and i just shot.
Myself.
I think seriously hot was being and.
Everything i didn't i was like oh god.
It's gonna sound so lame but i would.
Always like go on google how to talk to.
Girls and like what to say after hi and.
Yeah literally is the worst i didn't.
Know what i remember i went on a date.
And i like wrote stuff in my hand like.
Things to say so you know like oh mal.
Just get so nervous non-web i said what.
Did you learn that how do you talk to.
Girls uh well it was the most important.
Thing i guess.
It's not like it's you kind of just have.
To experience it you can't like there.
Isn't like it go - yeah like before i.
Always looked a simple pickup and stuff.
Like that and just be like okay how how.
Do they pick up girls and how they make.
Make it look so easy unless you just.
Experience and just you know you build.
Up the confidence or would you like.
Failed a lot you made a lot of guys.
Saying you just have to fail yeah just.
Have to go in and fail to the point.
Where well i felt so many times i can't.
Get any worse than this and then.
Eventually just go up from there and.
Yeah you just i just got more.
Comfortable and then yeah i started just.
Going home with look at you know you got.
A girlfriend and yeah six guy friends so.
Clearly something is working right.
