Soul david is so like hesitant review on.
The podcast now since he's since the.
First podcast so he's afraid of things i.
Mean that's gonna get him like i'm a bad.
Comment i'm afraid of people.
I know internet you've changed you.
Afraid of internet people internet could.
You imagine what the world would be like.
If olson and the internet was gone now.
What the world would be like at the.
Internet lism yeah if it suddenly just.
Disappeared i think life would be great.
And it wouldn't be great how so is it.
Because like you couldn't just watch any.
Movie i mean out driving i can't i.
Wouldn't be able to listen off the pill.
Podcast disgusting you're disgusting you.
Know what though really like.
Realistically i think a lot of people.
Would be to like become depressed i.
Really think like people are super.
Addicted to the internet i think i am.
Right i think most of us are but there's.
Some people especially kids growing up.
Who only know the internet life who are.
They would be lost i think it would be.
Like where's my memes how do how do i.
Know what to say or think who do i copy.
Now you know not to change the subject.
But ninja milk i am i'm a big fan like.
Congratulations in paying me for this.

Because it's actually really good i.
Bought two cases i know to support i.
Appreciate it yeah no no we sent you.
Something i appreciate ya ninja mel calm.
In jammu calm a lot of people bought.
Actually yeah and i'm michael over 2000.
Cases or ordered sweet yeah so i mean i.
Could say oh we sold tens of thousands.
Of cans but it doesn't sounds good when.
You say the cases yeah so i mean it's.
It's doing well i mean it is yeah that's.
Great but yeah you know we could do.
Better.
Yeah thanks for bringing that up i.
Wasn't going to well actually but it's a.
Lot a lot of people's concern was that.
Oh there's milk in it you know so do i.
Have to shake it or like emily be.
Lactose intolerant oh not to shake it.
Yeah we know where people keep asking me.
That because i guess they think it's.
Milk i mean there is milk in it but it's.
Not don't shake it yeah you should you.
Don't have to shake it you know like i.
Mean like i think you guys are somewhat.
Lactose intolerant right and then dude.
When i eat cheese cakes bro the next day.
The toilet is my best friend do my.
Cheeks are making out with that toilet.
Room.
She cakes cheek cake dude but you don't.
You drink you drink a couple cans yeah.
Diarrhea.
Yeah i drink a couple like and i don't.
Have diarrhea i just have caffeine.
Headaches that's the thing that i like.
Isn't caffeine a from this not from.
Coffee you get caffeine headaches a.
Little bit yeah from coffee i don't get.
That i think you don't drink enough.
Water no i drink a lot i actually carry.
A jug with me and i made sure to drink.
Like at least half of the jug so i'm.
Pretty healthy person except for the.
Fact that i eat like fried foods every.
Day and sheet cakes and cheat cakes you.
Know you know just like janae aiko says.
Dude eat the cheek cakes like groceries.
But just to sorry we change the subject.
Three times in this short segment but to.
Change it up again because we are doing.
Something different i would like to.
Announce and this is our 20th episode.
We're gonna change up this podcast a.
Little bit and even more so thanks to.
People like skillshare people who.
Sponsored this so we can finally afford.
We're opening up another podcast natalie.
Yeah oh i was waiting for it is that.
Play.
That doesn't fit hold on you're about to.
Get me opening up another podcast in la.
Music.
So why are you guys opening uh what i.
Mean it was always kind of the plan if.
Once we could afford it things to.
Sponsors and stuff but because most of.
Our i mean i thought i could get guests.
Out here everyone we know is in la.
There's very few hot here and yeah i.
Think i want to change that up a little.
Bit and also this is supposed to be.
Temporary this room is very small yeah.
Looks big on camera though it does.
Surprisingly but it's it's not yeah i.
Can't wait for all the equipment to.
Leave so i can finally move in what yeah.
This is my room in your part of the.
House yeah anyway speaking of changes.
Though what we wanted to do is try out.
These new segments kind of like shows i.
Guess within the podcast kind of.
Inspired off you know what you like.
Radio stations to do right they have.
Like a little like sometimes they do.
Pranks and sometimes they do like no.
Games and stuff so we have a few little.
Games that we wanted to try out who.
Knows if you guys don't like it we.
Probably won't do it but we have fun.
Doing it so we're gonna try out this new.
Game that we made up called don't dudes.
The bit where we supposed to say we.
Didn't actually plan this out we just.
Made it up before before this like in.
The kitchen so i say clearly three to.
One should make yeah i think let's cut.
To a graphic right sorry well we'll.
Improve it paco explain the rules for.
Dumb dude dumb dude's debate it's hard.
To say true not that different debate is.
About basically you have two options of.
A either goofy topic or more serious and.
Two dumb dudes have to debate it one.
Person gets to pick which side they.
And then the other person has the.
Leftover side no matter if you believe.
In that or not you must support it with.
Any sort of logic or just do your best.
Logic best yeah but wait should it be.
Like you get to choose which side you.
Want or should like someone else i know.
Whoever's like the middle - i can is.
I'll just try i don't want to do this.
Right i want to watch youtube you're.
Gonna have to do this guy's already we.
Can be okay we already do this i give.
You guys lee can i give you as a topic.
Okay i'm dudes debate all right let's.
Just start one because okay here we go.
So i'm gonna start off with should dance.
Be considered a sport i want paco to say.
That it should not be okay i believe it.
Ryan to say already i want ryan to see.
You know wait wait no i want ryan to.
Believe yeah say that you do support it.
Okay okay you don't sir paco doesn't.
Support it.
Ryan supports it and i wish i had more.
Time to think about this who should be.
Considered this sport maybe paco can go.
First then they should not be a sport.
There's no ball involved okay start with.
Something okay it's fine but there's a.
Lot of sports that don't have a ball.
Involved like well unless you're gonna.
Make a joke wrestling is a sport women's.
Wrestling is a sport i agree so but you.
Know.
So you're saying every sport needs to.
Have a ball involved well swimming more.
Likely it's a sport there's water polo.
And if you can water polo yeah but.
Swimming in it and therefore it requires.
Balls but swimming itself that's a sport.
Yeah yeah yeah your arguments invalid.
I'm talking about most sports most.
Sports need balls alright okay we're.
Gonna move on to dance dance is more of.
An art - it's more of an expression you.
Can dance with balls no yes you can't.
Dance with balls but even if you could.
Dance the balls how are you supposed to.
Score it like i think what makes a sport.
If you're doing a school okay so tell me.
This then tell me this when people do.
Ballerina or when they do uh like those.
Talent shows and they hold up numbers.
Yeah they were symbols well regardless.
They do that right hmm that's a score.
But it's also it's based off.
Technicalities also losing kelly i'm.
Using all the a lets mmm that's what.
Dance is most fatality cuz i'm going to.
Kill it with this topic right here go.
Ahead.
It's known that even in those words.
Judges are biased only for all sports.
Judges are biased don't reaser bias - in.
Basketball yeah but it's very difficult.
When there's a actual physical score.
That you can see progressing throughout.
The game i don't know tomorrow but i.
Don't know if i said i don't know we set.
A time it we probably should do that in.
The future because i don't we could go.
On for days based on what we just talked.
About who won this debate in your.
Opinion i'm or the time i'm gonna base.
It off of passion which is which doesn't.
Really mean anything well i like passion.
Passion i think for this particular.
Round i'm gonna give it to paco you have.
Three points yeah okay the points don't.
Matter just like in yes okay i got.
Another one okay how about this one.
First of all wait all the dancers are.
Gonna handle a hate on no but that's but.
That's the point is you don't have to.
Actually believe it but you have to.
Argue it they're trying to make it.
Delicious they're trying to make it in.
The olympics you do believe it huh i.
Mean cuz i'm i kind of went out of the.
Dance community so it's really up to.
Them actually you have yeah he used to.
Be a dancer no thank you he's a great.
Dancer no way i was in the top 16 of.
Freestyle session humblebrag.
Anywhere was was are you better than i.
Gave you something no no eric was like.
Talking the world yeah there's an animal.
An actual animal i've seen him eat it's.
Disgusting next dumb dude debates dumped.
Next dumb dudes debate question what's.
Better dogs or cats mmm.
What do you do you have a preference.
Yeah what do you have a preference i.
Have a preference what do you i well.
Clearly your dog you know but what's.
Your record.
I'll take cats okay all right guy that.
Makes a head this job easy okay go ahead.
Right dad we should do that we should.
Get to pick if you really want to argue.
The other side are way more dope in what.
Way do cats are way more cool down there.
They're low maintenance you don't kind.
Of walk them you literally can just.
Throw.
Anywhere anywhere and they'll just be.
Like walk up super slow take care of.
That eat it boom okay good.
Sure also you know they teach you.
Real-life interactions and that.
Brain-dead like dogs dogs will just come.
Up to you and show you love no matter.
What okay.
Sometimes a catholic i don't really want.
To talk to you that's like how humans.
Are man it teaches you you know the ebb.
And flow did you hang of relation you.
Think having cats is a learning.
Experience that's why people get pets.
People don't get pets because they they.
Want to learn about life they get pets.
Well you can learn that from dogs as.
Well but you get pets because for well.
For one you know you can't use a what is.
It blind blind eye cat there's no blind.
Eye cat so there's actually real uses.
For dogs right there's actually uses for.
Dogs you can also use dogs to smell out.
Drugs cash can do that there's real uses.
And then there's also like you said the.
Loving side the reason the most people.
Get dogs because they want love cats.
Don't give you that love cats can give.
You lay don't you know what they give.
You a bunch of fur balls everywhere.
Whoa have you ever had a cat in your.
House yes it's crazy.
Roku does the same thing he does nobody.
Imagine what imagine roku times three.
Four times four that's how much fur cats.
Leave are on all over the page is that a.
Fact.
They leave way trust me i had it he had.
A cat but there's ultra hyper allergenic.
Cats really so they don't shed yeah you.
Have to groom them.
Well baby hypo they don't there's.
Cats and don't oh you get those.
Really bald ones but be real dude yeah a.
Little bald looking cat i know people.
There's a whole thing for people that.
Really like that be real would you want.
A cat like that.
No i win no you want a dog eats babies.
There are small dogs too right are there.
I haven't seen any that look like those.
Cats but there are okay i'll give you.
This there are blogs that i kill people.
Then there are cats who kill people very.
True but let's say that you know you.
Need those dogs to kill people let's say.
They're helping protect people like.
Those canines that work for the police.
You might need that too are you there.
Are they trained to kill i thought.
They're just trained to me well they are.
Trained and they're trainable you can't.
Train a cat to do that you can train a.
Tiger can you siegfried and roy believe.
We got yeah what this debate is over and.
You wanted the cats i think it's dope i.
Think it's over no disrespect to any cat.
Owners out there.
I am personally am a fan of dogs but.
It's a lot of i know for others that it.
Might be offended i like cats man cats.
Are cool i like cats - i also like dogs.
But i like dogs more i think i like cats.
Is because they're more just like just.
Super chill about a lot of things so you.
Like them because they're easy to take.
Care of because you're lazy well no i i.
Would want a dog - yeah but he had to.
Pick yeah would you like this is this.
Outside of the debate which if you had.
To pick would you rather have a dog okay.
I think you would want a cat because.
It's easier to take care not to say i.
Would want a dog i think i know because.
You would want a dog but like i think.
You would enjoy a cat because it's so.
Easy yeah but then i would fit but and i.
Want a dog because like you said they.
Just blindly give love yeah that's all i.
Want man all people want different pets.
Yes we take the best part yeah if a cat.
Starts you know i'm not all cats like my.
Cat was actually like wasn't my cat my.
Brothers cat was actually like really.
Loving cuz it grew up with three other.
Dogs i think that's why but it would.
Come to you let you pet it but i've seen.
Cats that just you go to reach for it.
And just runs away or they claw you yeah.
They claw you thank you i got again.
There's there's some dogs that do that.
But most times not yeah well that's that.
Concludes these i thought we already.
Concluded we will yeah i guess it.
Concludes the the topic of dogs and cats.
I think the winner of this debate i'm.
Unit i'm gonna go with ryan all right.
How many points you get cheers for you.
Ready folks don't matter there's one.
More oh we got another one yeah i got.
One more i got one more for you if you.
Guys are if you guys are open to it if.
You want to hear you do this maybe yeah.
All right sure or a three-way.
I love three ways.
Well there goes our money story skill.
Oh yeah go ahead.
Skill shadow just go share what did you.
Really have another one though yeah i.
Did i did um what is what is the most.
Salad.
What fruit salad or potato salad come up.
With this what is the most salad i don't.
Even know right right uh try to argue it.
This is hard this is a hard one are they.
So this just because we don't have any.
Rules in this game.
Let's all just argue this right now okay.
Someone pick it doesn't matter because.
This is your random one did you make.
This up no found online yeah what is.
Salad what is the more so it is most.
Salad yeah fruit salad or potato so what.
About macaroni salad sure that could be.
One of all the options to salad what is.
The fruits what i'm trusting sure a bowl.
Over fruit and then and then potato.
Salad is i tell you the mayo and potato.
Yeah not just that there's other.
Ingredients what is more salad they're.
Both equally not salads yeah but you.
Have to pick one i'm gonna go with.
Potato okay i'll explain why i would go.
With potato as well but all right i'll.
Go fruit then yeah then i think the.
Variety of a fruit salad is too much.
When you think of your traditional salad.
It's it's all green and it's all lettuce.
For the most part as a lie and a half.
We'll go ahead what else you got i think.
There needs to be a vein you ever heard.
Of a chef's salad that thing is all over.
The place never has every piece of.
Culture everywhere they got ham.
They got egg they got cheese they got.
Olives they got dressing pick whatever.
Dressing you the lon whatever chef you.
Want dude he can bake what and he like.
You want balsamic vinaigrette with ranch.
That's a weird combination but you can.
Have that chef's salad all right mmm so.
That's a lot of mixture.
What about fruit so we got fruits from.
Around the world different things things.
To spice up your taste buds all right.
What are you gonna get oh is that.
Watermelon is that cantaloupe or is that.
A turkey in terms of water you when you.
Think salad i'm being real technically.
You're thinking real like when people.
Think salads right you think lettuce and.
Or whatever like there's different stuff.
In it and dressing okay they're dressing.
For fruits.
Yeah i don't know i'm asking i don't.
Know i mean no need for salad i don't.
Think there are yeah it's just fruits.
Together right bunch of different potato.
Salad i mean potato salad has a dressing.
In itself already right well let's.
Define what a salad is like that most.
People think about it's just lettuce and.
All there's a lot of things it's lettuce.
Right there's no lettuce you could and.
You could add other things.
Ya know but the main ingredient it's one.
Main ingredients your point yeah it's.
One main ingredient not a bunch of rent.
Equally among both is is there a potato.
In most salads no is there there fruit.
In most sell it yes.
Tomatoes tomatoes is what there are.
Tomatoes so there's we're already.
Invading the salad we're pretty much.
Half the salad moses a dumb one this is.
A real argument that people looked up.
Yeah salad we're already also present.
Their song called berry vinaigrette dude.
That's a dressing true and we put the.
Dressing on the salad we already put the.
Fruity sweet sup with the salad that's.
The salad baby i think there needs to be.
One main ingredient in his salad potato.
Salad is potato normal salad is lettuce.
Macaroni salad is macaroni nobody puts a.
Salad there's macaroni as well there's.
More macaroni than there's potatoes so.
The so if i have to choose between.
Potato salad in a fruit salad i would go.
With potato salad because there's one.
Main ingredient.
You can't moderate and pick for your own.
Side dude i'm moderating this one i.
Thought no i thought we were all.
Debating yes you're gonna debate.
I moderate this and i say you guys are.
Equally dumb we're even talking about.
This i think it's a stupid one i think.
This is stupider than the other stupid.
Ones that we have this is the dumbest.
One i mean why the segment's because i.
Don't i don't get it yeah we're dumb.
Guys dumb dudes debate damn one of those.
Dumb dudes do two dumb debates that's a.
Lot of dumb dudes do tend to play just.
Don't do to dumb debates while.
Doo-dooing we could we use the outro.
Thing to cut off cut us off at any point.
So but also uh if you guys have any.
Other suggestions for dumb dudes.
Debate leave them in the comments below.
Or if you wants to stop doing this show.
Within the podcast please say bit.
Outside of that we'll keep it in the.
Kitchen where we normally do anyway save.
Save save on the show yeah let's get.
Back to just being us yeah like that.
That was justice being us though that.
Kind of we'd already do like kinda way.
We just formed it into a show um but.
It's fun it's fun to do stuff like that.
Is pretty fun yeah we do do that though.
Yeah i kind of feel lost now i don't.
Know what to talk about i think we.
Should be fighting over something that's.
Mom we talked a little bit about the.
Podcast movement to la yes so we're it's.
Gonna be um can i say it it's at your.
House whose house your house oh is it's.
At what yeah i'm gonna put it in your.
House i don't have a house there where.
Am i yes well once i get all the stuff.
They're like you know put it in my house.
Yeah we're gonna have a podcast in your.
House specifically your bed i would have.
It in my house but i don't have a house.
There i go i guess it's at my house now.
Yep we're gonna have a podcast at.
David's house i'll be out there a little.
Bit more and we're gonna get some.
Already have a lot of people who are.
Willing to be on the show name have to.
Do it you don't have to do when i go out.
There a whole tour of people's podcast.
So i always say like alright when i come.
To la then.
Through the pot there's so many i have.
To do are you doing them all in one day.
I don't think this possible is only.
Traffic right it's not possible these.
Podcasts are like hour to two hours long.
There's some podcast though that i'm.
Like a little intimidated by like what.
Like ethan's podcast mmm.
83 yeah they get their fans are very.
Like they're vicious harsh they will.
Destroy you yeah that's why i'm like i.
Don't i feel like david on here like i.
Feel like i have to be that's why i mean.
To you because i'm getting you ready oh.
Is that why you're harsh critiques yeah.
I'm definitely shaving for that one.
Definitely i don't want people make fun.
Of me you know what they're does but.
There's not much controversy from your.
Side thank mean they don't they don't.
They usually have guests that are.
Controversial in essence not always but.
The comments are just kind of harsh on.
That podcast yeah another one somebody.
Keeps asking me they're like you know.
Life it's not somebody people keep.
Asking me like oh what paquette like.
What podcast would you want to do and i.
Don't want to do the ones that i listen.
To because it's like man that's.
Intimidating you know like paula rogan.
Joe rogan i would never do that i would.
I mean that would be an honor but no.
It's great what i've heard about his.
Podcast like he's had like like famous.
People on it mike tyson like but he only.
Interviews people that he's interested.
In yeah yeah.
So could you imagine if you asked like.
Hey i want to be on the podcast he's.
Like i'm not interested in you i would.
Now i hate you hard no not at all i.
Would make no real sense cuz i'd be like.
What would we talk about his pockets are.
So like he's like scientists on you know.
Like what am i gonna contribute.
Oh joe i'm just not talking as myself.
I'll wake up and then i write oh joe i.
Was just picturing myself on joe's.

Cuz i want to i want to use it but i'm.
Not going to hold him back thank you we.
Appreciate that brian he get to see.
Better do you guys hear about that.
Straight parade straight pride straight.
Pride pride pride pride parade straight.
Pride parade you sure about it yeah yeah.
I saw it artic with justin this morning.
Actually and i thought it was a joke but.
It's not.
I realized it wasn't you know as it was.
Opposed by a lot of my gay friends and.
They were very upset i don't really know.
What it was about i thought it was just.
Like people trolling i assume is people.
Trolling right nope knowing well i know.
It's a real thing but they're trolling.
Like they're obviously like what what.
Are you gonna be proud about like.
Hugging you.
I mean can you be pride later prideful.
Of that like oh i'm so straight yeah but.
Where the.
Isn't that the majority of people do use.
More straight people and it's more.
Socially acceptable that's the whole.
Point of having gay pride right its gay.
Pride month it is yeah so your birthday.
Month it is today.
Mm-hmm birthday happy birthday ryan dude.
Too bad you weren't gay because then.
We'd be like happy birthday and it's.
Yeah it's same time a month yeah that'd.
Be great.
Oh sure birthday dude eve all like like.
Gay people this month can say happy.
Birthday that's a that's a night one.
Dude you really kind of run far with.
This joke no i really wish some was like.
Happy birthday did that be amazing i.
Would go to a birthday party just come.
Out dude just come out of the closet or.
You know who'd want to go to it's so bad.
We know just come on cause gary dude.
Straight straight pride parade is not.
Gonna be it's one of the gay pride.
Parade if you think about it what is.
That even do you even look into this are.
We just talking about nothing what do.
You do i'm like well i mean so what is a.
Gay pride per well gay pride parade is a.
Place where like homosexuals go and they.
Celebrate and their diversity and raise.
Awareness and they have colorful flags.
And way too much glitter and maybe you.
Know a lot of touching and high-fiving i.
Would assume straight pride parades have.
To be the opposite of that what would.
That look what is the opposite black and.
White flags that's it welcome to shades.
Of grey different yeah it would be the.
The gay pride parade flag but just like.
Without any color like you put a black.
And white filter on it i wonder why the.
Rainbow became the sign of gay yeah.
That's good one as you know in hawaii we.
Are our like uh-1 or like our college.
Team is closing the ring we wore the.
Rainbow where the rainbow warriors we.
Were just the rainbows at fir oh yeah we.
Were the rainbow were just a rainbow and.
Then it became because it's white.
There's a lot of rainbows right makes.
Sense and then it just became this like.
Gay symbol and well now we're just the.
Four years really the warriors but you.
Still got people throwing rainbow.
Warriors that's where we were yeah so.
Maybe hawaii's homophobic hmm or were.
The rainbow warriors so.
Hawaii's fighting for gay pride could be.
That's here yeah yeah well i just i.
Don't know i don't see what the rainbow.
Has to do with gay yeah i'm just i'm.
Just curious ya know there's probably a.
Reason that's a great question i i don't.
I don't even know ya what do you think.
It means that you think it means like.
Just accepting every color yeah more of.
A race or like it could be like a.
Diversity thing you know like i like.
Roses.
Rainbows should be like for i'm against.
Racism because i like yes color.
Absolutely versus so so what would the.
Gate we're like changing the simple.
About what would the gate like if we had.
To make a new flag right that represents.
Like i think for yeah well i'm not a.
Racist straight men make a flag but.
We're using logic like we're literally.
Saying i accept every color and it makes.
Sense right if you're not racist yeah so.
How would you wouldn't you want to with.
The same colors yeah i mean that's true.
Actually like i'd like a maybe like a.
Pink and a red versus or like a yellow.
In a orange like pink pink something.
Blue so no like yeah traditional not be.
Were gonna say oh so you're assigning.
Colors to maybe that's why they didn't.
You so they could stay away from that.
Hmm and that was pc this out the week.
Damn you didn't do like a synchronized.
In do anything do it go be seeing it.
Softly he's a singer so you like.
Imitates really well mm-hmm but um my.
Topic at her i'm actually really i like.
Kind of can you look that up real quick.
Cuz i'm actually really curious what the.
How did the rainbow become a symbol of.
Gay yeah it is right like it is it's i'm.
Not like just.
Otherwise they all just like got.
Together and just real smart about their.
Branding yeah.
You know what i found the answer here.
What says the rainbow flag was.
Popularized as a symbol of the gay.
Community by san francisco artist.
Gilbert baker in 1978 and know that no.
Because he actually has a collaboration.
With nike for their shoes coming out.
Okay.
The be true selection guy okay so some.
Guy did that but why like why what does.
It mean the different colors are often.
Associated with diversity.
Yeah it's like a community.
But actually have literal meanings oh.
Look into those literal meanings i think.
You think uris mother said i am i was.
Wondering yeah what does it have to do.
It just became a common like common.
Knowledge if the run was a success eh.
Mm-hmm right the lgbtq probably one in.
78 sorry red life orange healing yellow.
Sunlight green nature blue harmony peace.
And purple violet spirit it sounds like.
You're just naming things that sound.
Like the color yeah so what does that do.
With a movement though you know what we.
Should probably add 74 head no word.
Baker did come on the show because well.
We could yeah you know if he comes on.
Though ask him if we can get some those.
Be true shoes though they're pretty.
Clean dude they weren't she's really.
Nice be true what is it he true i.
Believe that's what's called be true.
It's a collection that he does with nike.
And i think i think every year they're.
Having a release during this month.
They're dope how do you guys feel about.
This is kinda edgy oh honey how do you.
Guys feel about when you would i mean.
Just i'm only bringing this up because.
It's gay pride month yeah how do you.
Guys feel about people telling you not.
To eat at chick-fil-a oh man wait you.
Gotta go there with me.
Bro i don't i know you guys love i love.
Chick-fil-a too but there's some.
Articles that i read and i'm like and i.
Feel so guilty.
Well let me sum is i don't more recently.
Like how do i make up for that so that i.
Can still hey you know more recently i.
Heard that chick will actually donated a.
Lot of money like to the you know.
There's that big shooting in the club.
And yeah long time ago but they did well.
They do.
They did donate argue that that's kind.
Of a pr thing right cuz i mean they had.
That reputation right the whole the.
Whole drama there for people who don't.
Know it's because they're a christian.
Company and i guess in the what what is.
The whole drama there there's a lot of.
Drama there but i'm not exactly sure.
What incidents it was that they.
Supported christian organizations that.
Support anti-gay laws right something.
Like that probably i that too and also.
Just like the way that they said.
Traditional traditional marriages right.
So the.
So i understand that and obviously like.
If i'm you know i've been in a situation.
Where i was we were trying to figure out.
What to eat and i was with a gay guy and.
He like we all decided let's go.
Chick-fil-a he really really felt.
Strongly so we didn't right yeah and i.
Don't mind that but and i think that's.
Right and i think that's fine that we.
Still wanted it but like we didn't go.
Because out of respect but is it still.
Wrong because i read articles that make.
You just feel like a novel person is it.
Still wrong to go to chick-fil-a on your.
Own because you're supporting something.
That doesn't support like your friends.
Are like you know i've read articles.
That make me stay i see they're like i.
Don't go there all the time but like i.
Like i like the food you know like i.
Can't i'm not gonna pretend like i don't.
But am i supporting something by going.
There do i'm saying like yeah for sure.
It was kind of like the whole like thing.
We talked about me being not being.
Vegetarian even though i feel bad for.
You know how all animals are slaughtered.
And stuff it's it's a selfishness yeah.
The vegetarian one is a little bit more.
Understanding that's because gabe gay.
Pride month it's a little hard to say.
That but i'm not gonna i'm gonna be.
Honest like i like their products yeah i.
Mean i was gonna come in agreeance with.
That like when you tie it into the whole.
Like vegan or vegetarian thing but.
That's what i'm trying to say it's like.
I read those articles like last year.
When that happened and like i was like.
Yeah this makes sense i'm just not gonna.
Eat there i don't need to but then i you.
Know i used sometimes a whole year goes.
By i know you kind of crave sometimes.
And yeah i know i went there and i have.
Gay friends and i have respect them and.
I understand it you feel like i'm not.
Trying to sit like i'll still support.
Them but like i don't i don't know there.
Are also a lot of agree with the.
Correlation yeah there are also a lot of.
Gay people who do still go to.
Chick-fil-a i know there are but i'm.
Talking about the huge amount of people.
Who will be really mad at me even saying.
This ball so i'm a question i have a.
Question how much of my spicy chicken.
Deluxe meal is going towards gay hate.
How much if you could get an yeah of how.
Much hate you're contributing what would.
That affect you what if it was fractions.
Of.
Penny oh but it's still that's the.
Principle right is the principle it's a.
Principle but what if there was a dollar.
Amount do you think that would make.
People gonna be like oh maybe i.
Shouldn't oh sure.
You know do this or would you think.
People are like oh it's fractions of a.
Penny you know or like what they could.
Do right hear me out.
You have if i know what the value is.
Right they find out what that fraction.
Of a penny is right yeah and you say.
They offer you hey would you like to add.
Pay an extra dollar to support gay gay.
Rights and equality it would never do.
This but they say okay i'm going to.
Chick-fil-a i'm gonna donate $1 to.
Support equal rights for gay people.
That's just to make myself feel better.
Dude what make you that would be i think.
A organisation really cool with that cuz.
In there getting something not they.
Would have never got it like yeah out of.
Guilt in their movement like they're.
Like you know i like salvation army yeah.
Whatever yeah they're outside they're.
Ringing the bells or people who are like.
Save the whales they have you sign a.
Petition so like people ask you like how.
Many times have you had chick-fil-a this.
Year and then you tell oh yeah so you.
Can do that and then you don't have that.
Guilt exactly now i think organizations.
Should think about it because there's a.
Lot of people like me i think who really.
Like their products and don't wanna you.
Know yeah upset that community yeah and.
Then you be like well this everybody.
Wins.
Mm-hmm they get my money and you get my.
Money and i get my food those delicious.
I don't know what i really went well i.
Think we're gonna get i like chick-fil-a.
I i love i know you i think they're.
Really the service is great you know.
It's it's hard yeah they're one of the.
Nicest like the workers yeah the best.
You know i know there's a bunch of.
Towards the towards the like the.
Co-founders and yet a company but the.
People who work there are literally like.
Have you ever been there they're like.
The nicest they're trained to be though.
Yeah they're supposed to be that way.
Yeah what's they have to say something.
All the time.
They even oh they say my pleasure my.
Pleasure instead of like you're welcome.
Because they're there to serve people.
And and have.
Yeah no faster there's like really like.
Small things like that that just make.
You feel like oh nice nice p some people.
In relationships don't even hear that.
Yeah i think i think everyone should be.
Able to eat wherever they choose to.
Whatever the organization believes.
Because it's its food but it doesn't.
Mean you don't leave in it right it you.
Are supporting it is what the articles.
Yeah i write are saying but you know.
I've also seen like in because i go to.
The the chick-fil-a in hollywood i see a.
Lot of gay people there too i do too i.
Even saw a before they're all gay pia is.
Here's the thing like nobody really.
Knows what the companies generally stand.
For in general like for example we don't.
Know if the manufacturer of this table.
Right now is like a racist a racist or.
If there's a person who you know some.
Supports gay marriage or doesn't support.
We don't know these things for majority.
Of the products that we use in this.
World i guess the the question is like.
If you're if you know that they do that.
Is it bad to support even if it is a.
Great product you know and i think.
People should still be able i mean.
People should just make that choice for.
Themselves you know and shouldn't judge.
If someone else.
I have chooses to like but there's gonna.
Be there that's exactly the point there.
A lot of people are being very much so.
Judged especially gay people then they.
Should they're like oh yeah that like.
How dare you yeah like this is going.
Against what you are and i mean it's it.
Was actually the article is more.
Targeted towards gay people who go to.
Chick-fil-a and people who support equal.
Rights like the act like active people.
Who still go there yeah.
And they made a very compelling are i.
Don't know what where that article was.
From yeah there's it there was a couple.
Because it's you know gay pride ones but.
I mean look if me if i found out that.
Mcdonald's promotes wars or like putting.
Sends money to terrorists it'd be really.
Hard for me to not eat filet-o-fish when.
I'm craving it but when you say supports.
You know wars and stuff like we'd have.
To see what exactly have they done yeah.
Like is it.
Oh they support like like nobody's gonna.
Support i support war you know there has.
To have some like even when you're when.
They're supporting their religion yeah.
And it just so happens that their.
Religion has that clause and you know.
Like it's not like there's trying to.
Support i just don't like gay people.
Or a certain type of people it's because.
It's in the religions whatever they.
Believe i don't think any like.
Mcdonald's be like hey i support war.
Unless it's like in the religion or.
Simply did right right but what i'm.
Saying is it's not like they're just.
Supporting that for that reason i don't.
Think anybody does things just for the.
Fact of like hate right it's because of.
What they it might be hateful but i.
Don't think they intentionally do things.
To like be hateful yeah i don't think.
It's more often i think the the.
Protection of their own beliefs and.
Values or their rights type of thing or.
Their like it's a lot of times like oh.
Like people just being selfish because.
They're worried about oh how is this.
Gonna affect me you know so a lot of.
Times like when a smaller minority group.
Who's been oppressed when they're like.
Trying to raise awareness or ask for.
Equality a lot of times the higher.
Higher groups in quotes you know will be.
Worried because they're like oh well our.
Privileges or our lifestyle have to.
Change you know and in the it's in the.
Same way we're like if this is gonna be.
A stretch of a metaphor but in the same.
Way with divorce how women wall is if.
They're married to a successful in rich.
Man and when they get divorced the the.
Money that they get paid they get paid a.
Lot more because they're used to the.
Lifestyle you know.
That's what they say the argument is.
Used to the lifestyle so a lot of times.
That in that same aspect the the people.
Who are in power they're worried like oh.
Well i have to adjust my lifestyle you.
Know and how am i good how am i gonna be.
Used to this new movement this new wave.
So that was our topic on chick-fil-a.
Happy i just thought it was interesting.
You know i thought guilty i'm sorry i.
Have to say i'm sorry no support eat.
Right you want yeah i support equal.
Rights but i don't i don't feel like.
Even if i if they have enough money.
Right those foundations what do they.
Really what can they really do i guess.
They can change laws that's what they.
Can do.
But i don't really know i don't know.
What.
Like i don't know enough i don't know.
The truth i'm just hearing one.
Perspective to person like i mean i'm.
Hearing the perspective of gay people.
Yeah who are mad at me for going there.
Not me specifically but us i don't know.
I think there will be a lot of gay.
People who are okay with you going to.
Chick floyd because there's a lot but i.
Mean there's a very huge majority and.
Articles like that cuz i read it and i.
Was like i can go there by the time i.
Finished reading it i was like oh man.
People this is compelling like i i don't.
Need to go there and then throughout the.
Year i was like there all the time don't.
Worship the place no it's just a chicken.
Sandwich come on.
I know just a simple some people are.
Just saying would like to get upset i.
Get it.
I get i get their reasoning i get their.
Reasoning going just get it to a topic.
That's not gonna get us in trouble.
Should we go to check for this okay.
Let's get let's change topic this wasn't.
A heart i know i know but you know what.
I'm laughs i like talking about this.
Because it's interesting it is other.
People relate to it no no yeah because.
It's a cop it's a it's a thought that.
People have people only may not voice it.
Because they're worried like oh if i say.
This does it make me a bad person.
I think it's a common thought to have.
Like oh will i offend people see what.
They're having is what i think too is.
Like a lot of people might have that.
Thought but once they read that article.
And they see the majority they see what.
Most people find like what's the easiest.
Way to not upset people there they trick.
Themselves to being like i'm not gonna.
Think twice if this is right there's no.
Right or wrong like this is what's right.
I'm saying that it isn't or it is i'm.
Just saying people there's a lot of.
People i think who don't even think.
Twice they just follow what's exactly.
Like if that was a less common opinion i.
Think it would be the opposite like if.
People like to go with what's working.
And what gets you.
I guess less hate some people like.
Getting more hate i don't know where i'm.
Going with that.
Hhor-- pinion i think it what's.
Beautiful is that lyman has it of their.
Own have their own beliefs values and.
You're trying to not get hate comments.
You're trying to do all right i eat a.
Chick flick all the time i actually went.
There last week did you really i did.
Yeah wow.
You know what you should do those but it.
Doesn't make me a bad horse what about.
This what about this yeah kind of going.
Back to what we said maybe there's a.
Sale you donate load that who will say.
That you are a bad person for going last.
Week you know what those people are.
Whacked how about if not let's.
Compromise okay it's it's gay pride.
Month i will not go there for the month.
Of june mmm i don't even go every month.
So that's not even how about this how.
About someone how about someone in the.
Gay community create something better.
Than chick-fil-a and all yes exactly.
That's difficult all i care about is.
Having a good chicken set is true and if.
It tastes good i'm gonna go or what they.
Chick-fil-a should do well i guess their.
Whole thing is like based on religion in.
Principle they should just bring in like.
A gay ceo but he would they would never.
Do that yeah wow so hateful something.
That would not get us into trouble for a.
Change.
You're right over there oh sorry i'm.
