Warning the following videos very.
Serious and based on true events it is.
In no way super for men to be funny.
Comedic or taken as a joke however i.
Didn't take my adhd medication before i.
Started filming editing this video which.
May cause this video to seem less.
Serious and more confusing and.
Invisibles to be viewer discretion is a.
Word we are good to go first vlog of the.
Year and i well that's what i'm supposed.
To do today i'll supposed to cut my hair.
Like so poofy on so this video was.
Supposed to be the first video of the.
Year but as most of you know i fell.
About 3 weeks behind schedule because.
The last video took over a month to me.
Never ever doing that many effects in a.
Video ever you'll probably do another.
One but i wanted to start the year with.
Something a little more personal and.
Today i'm gonna be talking about.
Something that i've never really said.
Publicly and it's something no one other.
Than my closest friends and some family.
Know but first let me start off by.
Saying my new year's resolutions this.
Year were pretty much your typical.
Resolutions exercising more and dieting.
Baby more mature the main one was i was.
Gonna keep making youtube videos without.
Having to sacrifice my health most of.
The time really goes into write i read.
Them all on my laptop in my phone but if.
I were to print them on a paper the.
Stack would probably look something like.
This ya know i didn't sell too many.
Scheme' whose back in all night i don't.
Even make like 99% of these ideas cuz.
Most of them make absolutely no sense.
Out of all these there's probably only a.
Few worth filming like dragon ball z.
Fight in real life what a great idea.
That doesn't sound overly time-consuming.
Difficult and all-around stressful to do.
At all.
Ducking dragon i don't want to pick that.
All up so i'm not gonna push it but you.
Know how mad i am anyway as fun as it is.
And looking the behind the scenes and.
Whatnot you know just trying to keep up.
With everything last year i was skipping.
Meals losing sleep feeling exhausted all.
Day and i ended up developing what was a.
Minor addiction i don't know where these.
Feelings come from or what they mean.
But there's just something about doing.
Crystal meth finding the smallest animal.
You can find and just strangling up to.
Just give you that rush you know yeah.
Doing a lot better this week thank you.
Guys let's run to ryan hello everyone my.
Name is ryan and why ryan hi then over.
The years i kind of developed an.
Addiction to energy drinks and caffeine.
Why freaking kidding me man.
I do meth okay and i strangle animals.
For fun.
You see wes over there he hooks up in iv.
When he sleeps so he can drink alcohol.
247 ted shoots up heroin just because.
He loves the movie twilight that much.
You're like my own personal brand of.
Bella and phil i don't even want to tell.
You what he's still just what is he i.
Still on myspace oh where'd you go see.
You see these these are real problems.
Why don't you come back to this cutaway.
When you have a real addiction no no.
Don't strangle him what no i wasn't.
Going to do that this is my dog he's.
Only here because he's addicted to.
Making immature people laugh what yeah i.
Don't know why i kept going with that.
That was supposed to be a quick cutaway.
Anyway okay yeah it's not like i'm.
Addicted to anything crazy like crack.
Crystal meth though i did just start.
Getting into breaking bad and crystal.
Meth does look kind of interest now on.
This on a joke do not ever do meth kids.
They're not even once yes that long.
Cutaway was supposed to be a joke but.
Caffeine addiction is a real problem.
It's a real thing and so was my space.
I'm a real drug addict yes caffeine is.
Legal but it is a drug i think is it a.
Drug see i wouldn't know because i.
Didn't graduate college because of the.
Caffeine caffeine not even okay i didn't.
Graduate because i wanted to make.
Youtube videos making youtube videos is.
What led to the caffeine so you could.
Say that youtube is a gateway drug.
Youtube is a gateway drug youtube the.
Gateway to caffeinated meth but.
Seriously the caffeine thing got pretty.
Bad last year i was literally drinking.
About four red bulls every single day we.
Were filming the candy chris video last.
Year which by the way if you watched.
That video again and replace candy crush.
With caffeine that's actually what i was.
Really talking about curse symbolism i.
Don't even know simple.
Zone is the right term because i didn't.
Graduate college because of the caffeine.
But during that shoot i remember i was.
So exhausted and burnt out just to.
Finish it up basically i ended up.
Drinking nine rebels in one day and that.
Night i ended up crashing from all the.
Rebels but i woke up like an hour later.
With my hand like trembling and my chest.
Was like in so much pain and i knew i.
Had to stop drinking so much caffeine or.
At least cut down so i told myself after.
The last min of the year which as you.
Guys know is that one ahh i just need to.
Take a break from youtube so i could.
Just stop drinking energy drinks for.
Like a month or so because i was.
Starting to get worried that i was.
Addicted to energy drinks which i didn't.
Think was possible before so why am i.
Telling you guys all this i know a lot.
Of you guys are younger than me and you.
Know when i was younger in high school.
In college i was surrounded by people.
That did drugs and i never did so that's.
Why i thought addiction could never.
Happen to me because i thought i won't.
Happen to weak minded druggies i guess.
What i'm trying to say is that for all.
You innocent kids out there you're gonna.
Be addicted to drugs.
Just kidding sorry this is a serious.
Topic addiction can happen to anyone so.
Be careful in terms of me i honestly.
Still do drink energy drinks but it's.
Definitely not for a day like it used to.
Be maybe one or two at the very most.
Baby steps all about the babies people.
Always make new year's resolutions and.
They never follow through because i.
Think once they break it or slip up.
They just say screw it and they just let.
It go but it's all about the baby steps.
I don't know why this babies moonwalking.
Like if your new year's resolution was.
To be nicer to people because you are a.
Dick every single day last year try and.
Be a dick every other day and then once.
A week and then once a month and then.
You relapse and go through this all-out.
Dick week and that's came out wrong so.
Did that never give up just take baby.
Steps because nobody likes a dick and.
Nobody wants to have an addiction.
Especially if that addiction is to being.
A dick which in that case makes sense.
Because nobody likes both those things.
That's why the word dick is in the word.
Addiction but that doesn't have to be.
You you can beat that addiction you can.
Beat that dick yeah my other resolution.
Was to be more mature that's clearly.
Working oh anyway i made this video.
Pretty much as an update at the start of.
The year i don't know a lot you guys.
Don't even care what the personal life.
Stuff and i probably like just drink.
More energy drink so you can post more.
Videos like your goddess thank you guys.
So much for watching i know i got off to.
A slow start this year but i am back in.
It and ready to make 2014 not just good.
Not just great but pretty average it's.
Gonna be another let's give me another.
