The body positive movement has evolved.
So much over the past several years that.
Now if somebody wants to lose weight or.
Lose fat all of a sudden you are an.
Antibody positive and you get kicked out.
Of the community the great thing about.
Problems is it makes me my most creative.
Shall we clap e claps yep welcome back.
To another episode of multiple podcasts.
You're a little premature there we got.
David in the moderator see pock was.
Right next to me i'm ryan and we have a.
Very special guest miss cassie home aka.
I was gonna say the other one i was.
Telling them earlier i don't know why.
But for the longest time this doesn't.
Make any sense i don't know why i bring.
It up.
I thought your youtube i called you bio.
Gates bio gates i thought for the.
Longest don't know why okay that makes.
More sense because it looks like that i.
It's like a little bio games is like a.
Little like bio hacker ii don't know i.
Just wasn't reading i just don't read so.
Anyway for people who don't know you are.
Probably if not the biggest fitness.
Youtuber or blogger or youtuber you are.
The biggest fitness youtuber right right.
And primarily i mean you do you do kind.
Of like vlog stuff it's not just being.
An instructor right started out with.
Instructor and then people wanted to.
Know what oh well what do you eat what.
Do you do and so it got which is better.
Cuz they care about you more right yes.
Sometimes it's not just you yelling at.
Them no but sometimes they care too much.
What does that mean you know i don't it.
Means it means that you you feel.
Obligated to know everything that's.
Going on in your life and they feel like.
They have control over what you do and.
If you don't do something that's.
Quote-unquote on-brand.
And all of a sudden you're wrong and.
You're a bad person and all this kind of.
Stuff i sense some tension there.
I feel like is i mean something on your.
Mind she's like you know what let's just.
Get right in yeah i know i like this or.
Anything open up.
Goods already right now did you want to.
Warm up no we're going wherever so this.
Is caught off the pill because it's.
Pretty much off the adderall at off the.
Ritalin.
Basically just our minds will go.
Everywhere so wherever we want to go and.
We're gonna start right there so just.
Get right to it.
No calisthenics we're going straight in.
Okay well yesterday was the end of my.
90-day journey so let me tell you what.
That is it started on august 16th and i.
Decided that i wanted to get to an.
Athlete level body fat percentage and i.
Wanted to lose some weight along the way.
Because that obviously is what happens.
And when i announced that because i was.
Gonna be blogging the entire time people.
Went crazy why yeah why exactly right i.
Preach eating healthy i preach working.
Out and that's exactly how i was going.
To attain these goals and i got called.
Out for being not body-positive.
For hating myself for being a bad role.
Model for women for being psycho and.
Needing to go see a mental health.
Specialist like the craziest things and.
The meanest stuff but i told myself that.
I wanted to go on this journey because i.
Needed to find my authentic self.
Throughout this journey i wanted to blog.
Every day for 90 days which i hadn't.
Done for a long time because i've been.
Getting a lot of you know opinions and.
People wanting to shape me a certain way.
In their head and so i over the past.
Several years have become a vanilla.
Cupcake trying to be what everyone wants.
Me to be and so the beginning of this 90.
Days was me speaking my mind again and.
So of course when i speak my mind with.
Very like tame stuff it's not only doing.
Anything crazy you know women's health.
Writes about it about me being.
Controversial buzzfeed daily mail and it.
Was it became this thing anyway i was.
Like oh my god like i'm literally gonna.
Lose a little bit of weight and i'm.
Doing it in a healthy way this all.
Happened yesterday no no so that.
Happened on august 16 yesterday was the.
End of my 90 days see congratulations.
Yes that's awesome that just very.
Coincidental we weren't playing.
Just do this after that yeah but okay.
Well how has the since that happened.
Kind of a while ago how is the response.
Been since like i'm sure people have.
Kind of come to their senses right like.
I'm sure they i mean i'm sure there's.
People who are still just like they.
Don't even read what your explanation is.
They just know oh she's not for was it.
Body-positive body-positive.
Music.
Yeah but i feel like that is that's been.
Your thing i don't know i guess maybe.
That's why they might have jumped so i'm.
Gonna i'm gonna cuz i've tried to.
Analyze this so much because i know that.
If other fitness youtubers are bloggers.
And now it's the same thing they.
Wouldn't get the response that i got so.
I'm gonna go back about to like 2013-14.
Or something i released this video where.
I was photoshopping myself to look like.
What the comments were telling me to.
Look like why don't you have a smaller.
Waist why don't you have a bigger butt.
You don't have abs you're not a real.
Fitness instructor which is really mean.
Because it doesn't matter what you look.
Like when you're teaching fitness you're.
Just teaching anyway so the video was me.
Photoshopping myself and that went viral.
And i was on good morning america and.
All these things it was crazy i really.
Didn't expect it but it was way for me.
To battle the haters and after that.
Moment any time any media outlet spoke.
About me it was body-positive fitness.
Influencer cassie ho body-positive.
Youtuber cassie ho it became like my.
Thing.
Yes the the the media branded me that.
Way but the reason why i even made that.
Video was because i was just a pilates.
Instructor and i was doing videos but i.
Just didn't have visible abs and.
Literally that caused the comment which.
Caused the media which now cause me to.
Be labeled as a body positive person or.
Something which is fine like that's fine.
But the body positive movement has.
Evolved so much over the past several.
Years that now if somebody wants to lose.
Weight or lose fat all of a sudden you.
Are antibody positive and you get kicked.
Out of the community and so that's kind.
Of like what happens that's so.
Hypocritical though because it's it's.
Your you can be positive about a skinny.
Body right or you can be positive about.
I mean it's not like you're saying hey.
This is what the standard of beauty.
Is i mean like if you want to lose.
Weight and you're happy about it then i.
Mean i don't see why that's an issue.
Yeah and i mean that's how i feel about.
It - as long as you're loving your body.
Along the whole journey whether you're.
Trying to gain weight or lose weight.
Like who cares even if you're trying to.
Get plastic surgery and you just like.
Love yourself you want it like that's.
That person's choice and we shouldn't be.
Here to judge them but yeah it's just.
Really changed the the evolution of.
Body-positive you have changed over the.
Years and when i announced it people.
Went crazy they were like unsubscribe.
You're terrible human you need to get.
Psychological help you're mentally ill.
Like these words kept repeating over and.
Over and it was interesting because this.
For me was a blog journey so a lot of it.
Was writing i didn't release a video on.
Youtube and the meanest comments.
Actually came from youtube not from.
Facebook or instagram youtube was really.
Critical because they didn't go over to.
Read my blog i think and just like judge.
Me based on like you know a little.
Caption and then go read here for the.
Rest they just like went wild and so.
Anyway it was lots of drama in the.
Beginning towards the middle still drama.
Little less a little less i just like.
Actually stopped posting on the youtube.
Community tab as much because it just.
Fired people up for some reason even if.
When it was positive stuff and then.
Towards the end now i'm about to do my.
Finale recap and i think that's gonna be.
Drama drama - but i am happy to tell you.
That i did reach my goals which is.
Really cool because yes who's in the.
Beginning when i announce my goals here.
Are so many people saying oh you're.
Number yeah you're so irresponsible for.
Announcing your numbers you make me feel.
Bad and all the kind of stuff and it was.
Just like insane yeah but you know what.
I kept going before you even did this 90.
Day challenge did you expect that sort.
Of response or at least think like maybe.
I'll get this or was that like not even.
In your thought process well i knew that.
It was gonna stir something but i didn't.
Know it would stir as much as it did it.
Was like i there was hatred like actual.
Like you are a bad human i did not.
Expect that so that was a lecture i was.
Actually really hard to deal with and.
Still is right now because i thought for.
Me with diet and exercise diet would be.
Hard because i like to.
Everything i can like literally eat.
Forever but dealing with the negativity.
That's been pushed on me that's been the.
Hardest thing yeah.
Well it almost seems like you're just.
Another victim to cancer culture.
Somebody who's just like you know.
Fanning the flint that people just like.
To be upset about something and i mean i.
Think if people actually took the time.
To hear what your side of the story was.
And not just i mean i'm assuming they're.
Just seeing things in a very broad scope.
Like reading up like reading a headline.
In an article and not reading the.
Article exactly and it just seems like i.
Don't mean i personally can't see how.
That's negative like i can't i can't.
Understand that you just wanted to go on.
And die it how is that gonna i don't.
Know there's some mind blowing to me.
Well i think like i i read the comments.
And you know there's hateful ones and.
Then there's constructive and i.
Understand where some of these girls are.
Coming from because some of them may.
Have an eating disorder i myself had an.
Eating disorder like way back then where.
I was scared of bananas and things like.
That and so mentally there was a time.
Period where i needed to heal myself.
Luckily through lots of work i am healed.
Now and so i think some fans were.
Generally concerned that i was falling.
Back into something dangerous so i get.
That but after explaining myself and.
Them seeing me being on this thing for.
45 days i'm totally fine like and still.
Getting that it's like you really just.
Don't want to see that i am better and.
I'm getting better so and i think maybe.
A lot of people look to influencers to.
Validate what they're doing because it's.
Like oh i look like her and it's okay to.
Eat like that or work out like that and.
Whatever and all of a sudden your idol.
Is now changing it's like i'm lost who.
Do i follow now you've betrayed me i.
Kind of think like that's probably what.
Happened yeah i could understand that i.
Guess when you say eating disorder does.
That mean eating too much or eating too.
Little so there's a lot of forms of.
Eating disorders there's you know.
There's anorexia where you don't eat.
Anything you eat very very little.
There's bulimia where you throw up the.
Food that you eat.
I had orthorexia which means i only ate.
Healthy food and i was scared of.
Anything that wasn't healthy it's a.
Disorder you know i.
I hate it is i don't know if it's like.
Medically a disorder but like something.
Just made it up like i like only healthy.
Food so i'm going to call it this is it.
Making me was it unhealthy well it was.
Because the fear of food so i always.
Felt like i was in food jail so i wait.
So i was in a bikini competition and for.
That i was super high protein low fat.
Pretty much eating just like egg whites.
Protein powder counted my almonds and.
Like very very low calorie during that.
Period when i was getting lean and after.
That period i was terrified of eating.
Bananas and apples i just thought they.
Were gonna make me fat and so mentally i.
Was messed up and i it took me a while.
Like actually a few years to break out.
Of that cycle because i also messed up.
My body and had metabolic damage meaning.
That sometimes i ate pizza and i would.
Lose weight and sometimes we eat salad.
And gain weight and nothing worked and.
So yeah kinda messed up my body when you.
When you talk about like the people who.
Are complaining about like the the fact.
That you're not body positive right.
Are these if are these types of people.
Are they a certain type like do they.
Have a certain type of disorder or is it.
Because i'm thinking that maybe the fact.
That you're trying to lose weight.
There's the the people are saying that.
You're not positive about being.
Overweight is it is that what they're.
Basically saying vice are you asking if.
The people that are commenting that are.
Overweight people yes basically i did in.
A very peaceful yeah because i.
Understand that i understand that like.
You should love your body even if you.
Are overweight and i know there may be.
People who have issues with being.
Overweight and it's tough for them to.
Lose it but i mean i think it's general.
Knowledge that being overweight is.
Unhealthy right here's my problem with.
Terms like overweight and obese it's.
Based off of a standard yes a healthier.
Nose what was it a bunch of caucasian.
People or what was it like what was it.
Like do you like our asian standards the.
Same as whatever the standards in the.
You know these medical textbooks are so.
I i don't feel comfortable with.
Standards i think they help doctors make.
A decision.
And i think when it comes down to it.
It's a very individual thing do i know.
If the people who are mad at me were.
Overweight or not i literally have no.
Idea but i can say that there they are.
People most likely with insecurities i'm.
Gonna say whether it be that they're.
Overweight or not yeah or or whatever.
Yeah or something and so i mean i don't.
Want to say that they're just projecting.
On me or whatever but it very much felt.
That way and it was interesting to have.
Your own fan base kind of just judge you.
So hard and yeah but it's all good right.
Now internally because i don't ever.
Regret going on this i feel amazing i.
Have so much more energy i'm stronger.
I'm faster and i'm just glad i did this.
To prove to myself that i could make.
Some goals and then reach them i asked.
What diet you did and what did you do.
Exactly what change.
What did i change so um the first month.
I did keto have any of you guys done.
Kido yeah okay cool i did keto but i i'm.
Lactose intolerant but i wanted to eat.
The cheese and the yogurts and stuff and.
I started breaking out a lot but i did.
Lose a 5,000 the first month but.
Anything i do in the first month i was.
About five pounds then i ate so many.
Nuts that i kept gaining weight steadily.
For a couple weeks and is like oh my god.
What's happening and then i realize okay.
Cassie like let's be honest with.
Yourself you are just overeating and.
Like i told you i can eat forever like.
Take me to a buffet and i will out eat.
Anyone i actually want to be a.
Competitive eater but i'm not gonna do.
That but i really want to have a burrito.
That's as big as a baby have you seen.
Those no no okay i kind of bit that's.
Not a normal baby right there are like.
Three footballs well something about.
Your dieting oh dieting yes so.
Overeating realize that i was probably.
Overeating even though as eating healthy.
Things um so the thing that really.
Changed it for me was tracking my food.
In my fitness pal and writing down okay.
I had this much and this and it really.
Taught me you know i feel like i know.
Portions but you can always feel your.
Hand a little extra make your tablespoon.
Like.
Twice as much and so really logging.
Everything weighing my food kept me.
Really strict in in a good way because i.
Knew exactly what i was doing what was.
Ingesting in my body i knew the macros.
And everything and so that really.
Changed it for me.
Yeah and workouts though i mean for the.
Most part i did like one rest day a week.
I started dancing more towards the end.
Of my journey and that made me less.
Stressed and were happy i feel like if.
You didn't work out you wouldn't be as.
Hungry i think you're so hungry because.
You work out so much people work out eat.
More right i mean you need more energy.
Okay so i did this blood test a genetic.
Fit test and i've also done 23andme have.
You guys done that okay so in my 23andme.
It says that i am genetically more.
Predisposed to be overweight and my.
Sister has fetus - predisposed to be.
Underweight also my dad i think my mom.
Was like normal sam my husband is.
Predisposed to be underweight so or the.
Same weight so i already have the genes.
That make it difficult for me to be able.
To have a lean body which is interesting.
Because i'm in the fitness industry and.
Almost everyone has a lean body so where.
Was i going with this i lost my train of.
Thought again well that's fine i mean i.
Think i was just saying that i.
Personally the people i need to work out.
The most eat the most right because you.
Need energy and anyway so i took at this.
Genetic fit test that not only confirmed.
That but it also said that i had like.
Some genetic variant that said i like to.
Eat a lot so i know that was you know.
The thing i mean i probably have that.
Too i can eat a lot well you also seem.
To have high metabolism i think no i got.
Gained a lot really gained a lot of.
Weight really quickly and then he was a.
Lot of weight really quick oh wow i used.
To wrestle so i did really unhealthy.
Crash diets i say you know yeah a couple.
Days and were you doing like this mostly.
Water weight but yeah but yeah i mean.
There was this like when i start myself.
It was like the worst i mean you know.
Wrestlers yeah i'm sure you know those.
Weight classes yeah yeah so that was a.
Thing and we did the whole you know they.
Would do the whole body fat testing.
Hydration test we'd have to measure your.
Fat yeah yeah yeah all that stuff and.
And there's always people that there's.
Ways around it like it's a very.
Unhealthy do you tell me about it.
I mean i don't want to encourage other.
People wrestling right now i'm sure they.
Have better ways but they would.
Essentially the hydration test would.
Measure how much it your body fat is.
There's a minimum right i think it's.
Like for guys it's like 7% or six six or.
Something like that i don't know what it.
Is the healthy body fat and then they.
Compare that to your weight and how.
Hydrated you are see pee in a cup okay.
So i need people that would just use.
Like little visine bottles and just use.
That to hydrate their pee a little bit.
More oh so they'd be completely.
Dehydrated but they'd pee a little.
Add some water to it and using that that.
I don't know what that thing is where.
They look into this like a little.
Crystal tube thing and they see how.
Hydrated you are it basically that's the.
Way a lot of people cheated that stuff.
Oh wow okay so yeah resting is a very.
Dangerous sport.
We're spitting into a bucket what that's.
What that's what they did with my i did.
Wrestling as well oh you didn't there.
Were some people who spit into a bucket.
Like they would chew gum just to lose.
Weight i mean it was like not much.
Weight obviously oh if you keep doing it.
All day long you'll you'll have some.
Water weight that could you cry it out.
I'm sure we watch some sad movies you'd.
Be surprised i mean we did some.
Dangerous stuff like we used to like.
We're trash bags uh-huh and then go.
Running and then just sit sit in a hot.
Car choke the heaters and then you know.
Take x lacs and all that stuff oh my.
Gosh so you think you did damage to.
Yourself i think i did a good good.
Amount yeah that sounds like you used to.
Make weight and just bad habits i think.
Over it and i started like you know we'd.
Eat so much and then like see you our.
Weight increased by like 10 pounds and.
Then just crash and just lose it all and.
Then.
Mentality kind of stayed with me so.
Surgeon degree i don't do that as crazy.
But like i think it's a very dangerous.
Habit to get i mean i think it's a habit.
Because i think i still do that to a.
Certain degree not start myself like oh.
I'm gonna just lose it in a couple weeks.
And then if i gain it back i'll just.
Lose it again huh yeah that's crazy and.
It's interesting because we never really.
Talked about been dieting or men's view.
Of their bodies and how they feel about.
It.
Yeah and a lot of i mean i don't call it.
Names a lot of people they god guys they.
Care about that stuff too oh for sure.
Yeah getting bigger getting ripped yeah.
You know being skinnier you know stuff.
Like that.
Yeah normal i would say i think.
Especially when you're in front of a.
Camera you can notice like i notice if i.
Even gained like three pound i mean is.
That a lot if i can't like even three.
Pounds like you can see yeah so you know.
I feel sad and then i'll be like okay.
I'm not eating for the next three days.
Wait so do you guys like struggle with.
The way that you look in the mirror ever.
I don't oh not really not me safe for me.
I yeah i would i would say like there's.
Days where like man i don't want to take.
A picture today you know or like in and.
Then there's times when all like lose.
Weight and i feel not because i feel.
Like skinny is beautiful but like i just.
Feel like that's the right weight for me.
Like this is what my face should look.
Like or this is what my body should look.
Like you feel comfortable yeah yeah yeah.
And then i'm it's not that i don't when.
I'm bigger like i don't mind yeah but.
It's just like this is like what it.
Should be for me for like what i want.
Right so yeah i mean i would say there's.
Definitely days where i'd be like i.
Don't want to take a picture today yeah.
You were just talking about this today.
Uh with what you you said you do you you.
Were working out more and oh yeah just.
Like cuz you never work out i never work.
Out but like for me um.
Just noticing like when you look a.
Little bit more out of shape for me like.
I just want to look skinnier mostly.
Because i know if i'm skinnier that.
Means i'm more fit.
And it ought to be able to perform.
Better when i play sports right and see.
It's like performance based yeah that is.
True.
Yeah but i don't know is it about.
Halftime that's why yeah we're about.
There shall we take a two-hour shishi.
Break yeah let's do it.
All right so routine shishi break right.
Now and apparently this is a new thing.
So what do you have prepared for us.
You're gonna serenade us or perform.
Something where i have potential i don't.
Even know what she is where we take a.
Bathroom break and we are half time half.
Time break so what talent do you have.
That you can perform in 30 seconds oh i.
Can sound like a pigeon okay for 30.
Seconds what 30 no you just go ahead i.
Don't know what a pigeon sounds like.
About that is in hawaii i've had friends.
Do that and then they have their uh flip.
Flop or slip via slipper loosely on.
Their foot and they slap it okay so like.
The wings core yeah we didn't we this is.
Literally our first time asking someone.
To do that so you do that we're gonna.
Just start asking halftime show all.
Right we'll be right back after our cc.
Break.
Music.
And we're back i got a question okay.
Have you ever fasted like a straight.
Fast with just water no i have not.
I've read a lot about that and.
Apparently it's very good for you to do.
That once in a while like a straight up.
Fast so i've never done that i've done a.
Juice fast but that's still like calorie.
Like 1,200 calories a day so i was never.
Actually 1200 calories of juice juice i.
Just pressed juicery but like they're.
Beginners pack it was too sweet though.
But it made me lose straight-up seven.
Pounds in three days but it was just.
Water weight yeah in wastage instead of.
Stuff like that mm-hmm yeah but i've.
Never done a water cleanse but yeah i've.
Heard like monks can do it up to like a.
Month like i don't know i just really.
Like chewing yeah i love food too but i.
Tried it for three days it was thinking.
About food i will say that it did give.
Me a lot of clarity is weird okay how.
Did that happen i don't know that i mean.
I hear that that's what happens when.
You're on keto to my your brain.
Functions a little bit differently and.
You do get like this weird kind of.
Energy that's not your like normal.
Physical energy we do you like this like.
Your it seemed like my brain was not.
Tired.
It didn't seem tired yeah exactly i felt.
Pretty sharp actually when you don't.
Think about food then then your thoughts.
And the things that you have to focus on.
Actually are very clear so i don't know.
I noticed that for myself just want to.
See if you when i was on keto though for.
That month it was it was definitely not.
The diet for me like i was constantly.
Thirsty drinking like hmm you're.
Supposed to be though right i almost.
Like that - i was super thirsty i.
Started getting these keto like flu.
Headaches did you get that - i'm out.
Right yeah so then my friend who wrote.
Like a book on keto he was like oh you.
Need to take like you put salt in your.
Hand and actually like eat it plus you.
Need all these supplements and i was.
Like what that's not my thing like i.
Just really like to be food is my.
Medicine medicine was my food so i just.
Decided that wasn't for me yeah i don't.
Think i did it the right way.
We're like you check your key i just do.
That i didn't want to prick my finger i.
Hate needles i cry still as an adult i.
Didn't even know you could do that but i.
Didn't yeah yeah you like you're.
Supposed to prick your finger check your.
Ketones and be like oh am i in ketosis.
Or not yeah i didn't do it dad i did it.
Back before keto was keto before iya was.
A thing like i did it wrong but it was.
Like before it was a fad i would say.
Back in like 2010 so then you're doing.
Like atkins basically kind of but no.
Carb yeah like even down to like well.
Low-carb yeah down to like okay this has.
One gram i'm not gonna eat it wow yeah.
Because i didn't know i didn't know.
Anything there was no real information.
Out there i just knew that by starving.
Yourself with carbs your energy will.
Come from your fat that's all i knew i.
Didn't know anything else and that's not.
Quite the right way to do it but it it.
Works i mean you lose weight you just.
Don't feel great no you don't you know.
Any time you take out an entire food.
Group you're probably gonna lose weight.
From the initial shock anyway right.
And then you'll plateau yes uh-huh.
Uh-huh yeah yeah so i was wondering when.
Like what got you into the fitness thing.
Like were you when you were young where.
You always make into sports and were you.
Very active and is that what kind of.
Triggered that or was it was it.
Something else okay so my dad trained me.
And my sister in tennis when we were.
Really young so i started playing tennis.
When i was like five or six.
He's a usta coach and oh man it was like.
Asian dad yelling at you on the court.
Situation but he he was a good coach i.
Suppose because i made varsity my.
Freshman year as team captain from.
Sophomore to senior year but i hated.
Tennis so much because it had always.
Been about it being for my dad for.
Winning for the team so i didn't.
Discover fitness until i was 16 because.
When i was 16 i wanted to do a pageant i.
Wanted to do the miss teen chinatown.
Pageant and i wanted to you know look.
Good for it and like you know when.
You're a teenager is 16 and it's like.
2002 like i didn't know anything about.
Fitness but i saw an infomercial for.
Mari winsor pilates and i asked my.
Parents to find me a dvd because it.
Looked really cool like these women just.
Lifting their leg i was like that's.
Really fun you bought it for me and then.
I did those videos real.
Justly and fell in love with like home.
Fitness and it's crazy because now girls.
Do my videos just like that on youtube.
In their bedroom so when i was 16 i.
Discovered pilates i ended up getting.
Certified as a sophomore in college and.
Then i started teaching just on the side.
And then i didn't start my youtube.
Channel until after college and really.
It was just i was moving from la to.
Boston for my very first job and my.
Students at 24 hour fitness are like oh.
Cassie who else is gonna teach us this.
Because my format is pop pilates pilates.
Pop music it's kind of like a dance on.
The mat no one else was teaching that.
And so i said okay i'm gonna record this.
10-minute video put it on his website.
Called youtube it's just for you guys.
Like 40 people then i left and that's.
How the youtube channel got started.
Because i wanted to continue teaching.
From a distance which is crazy because.
That's exactly what i'm doing right now.
Except the world yeah that is crazy.
You've done in person i've seen pictures.
Of like you with like hundreds of people.
Like in person yes like this the dance.
Routines and stuff that's insane it's.
Crazy my biggest one was singapore and.
We were on the empress lan and we're all.
Doing like plie squats and i could.
Barely see to the horizon but i later.
Read that there were three to four.
Thousand people they had a plie.
Squatting with me and i was like in.
Singapore where it's like 90 degrees.
With like a hundred percent humidity.
Singaporeans are so like perfect like.
They were all on beat i don't know how.
But yeah i mean everything about them is.
Perfect it's like school for that.
Everything by the book yeah well a.
Couple of questions because you said you.
Graduated college right yeah but what.
Did you graduate biology so i majored in.
Biology and minored in business and then.
You are also like fashion buying at some.
Point yeah that's right so i had always.
Wanted to be a fashion designer i've.
Drawn dresses ever since i was a little.
Girl but when i told my dad and my mom.
That he wanted to become a fashion.
Designer.
They were like you were definitely not.
Doing that because you're gonna be poor.
And have no friends and.
I don't know all the other mean stuff.
You just see well you won't be.
Successful ever so i decided to not do.
It he said you should be a doctor.
Because you're doing well in bio and.
Chem right now so just go do that and so.
I did that but my heart was just not.
Into it my soul was gone and so i always.
Drew things on the side and while i was.
Teaching pilates in college i i had to.
Hold my yoga mat my cd my keys.
Everything was all over the place like.
This and so i decided to design a yoga.
Bag for myself and when my student saw.
It they really wanted to buy it then i.
Found a local manufacturer to make some.
Of these bags and before i left for.
Boston i remember sending out a few bags.
To some magazines but at this time you.
Know every bag that you make is like.
Gold because it's all you have about.
Eight months into my new job as a as.
Training to become a fashion buyer so i.
Really was like no i'm not doing this.
Whole biology thing my parents were so.
Mad at me because i dropped out of.
Organic chemistry last minute to make.
Sure i could not make it in time for my.
Mcat i had to sabotage myself because i.
Was such an obedient child that i just.
Went through with everything that they.
Said i wanted to be perfect and so i.
Really had to sabotage myself anyway so.
Eight months into my fashion buying job.
My sister is texting me and her fingers.
Pointing to something on on in the text.
And i noticed that it's my yoga bag in.
Shape magazine and so i took it as a.
Sign to quit my job and go for this 100%.
Because you never know if you're gonna.
Make it if you don't give it your all.
Right and so i quit my job.
I bought a ticket to china on friday and.
Left on sunday went to the canton fair i.
Found a manufacturer and then let the.
Bags develop i came back to boston and.
Pretty much just kept making youtube.
Videos cuz now i had no job and i was.
00 a.m. 12 p.m. and.
00 a.m. like every day and it was.
Weird 12 times a week barely making any.
Money and just trying to hustle wow.
So yeah that is a you don't i don't know.
If people realize how rare that is and.
Crazy and risky yeah especially because.
It seems like your childhood seemed to.
Be almost like a like a very your.
Stereotype like the tiny you for chinese.
Chinese being.
Okaywell asian parents say become a.
Doctor don't do this other nonsense and.
You decide to walk away from that.
Pissing them off in the process yeah and.
Going all in but everything's good now.
With the family they don't like that.
You're you know it's one of those things.
Where it's like never enough okay so.
Like even even if it's like i think they.
Are proud of me because it's this whole.
Landscape they don't even understand but.
It's always more like well why can't you.
Sell more you know just like those.
Little questions here and there like.
Yeah you know it doesn't make a follow.
Up question to that yes a lot of people.
You know they constantly want to know.
From their idols or people that they.
Look up to what made you make the jump.
Because you've made several different.
Jumps what gave you the courage or what.
Was the signs and what allowed you to.
Persevere through the hard times like.
Especially when the only thing paying.
Your bills was doing pilates and you see.
You had it rough yeah what made me take.
The leap was that if no one was gonna.
Believe in me i needed to believe in.
Myself and if i were gonna fail i wanted.
To fail hard and know that and be like.
Okay we're good with that i don't want.
To ever regret that i never tried and so.
I'm always willing to take the risk on.
Myself and you know back then as a.
College kid i just wanted to follow my.
Passion whatever that meant but.
Following my passion follow my gut has.
Gotten me to where i am today because i.
Know what feels right and what doesn't.
And my whole motto is do more what makes.
You happy do less of what doesn't and so.
Following that has allowed me to get.
Here do you think though uh because a.
Lot of people like yeah nice but uh you.
Did in a way your parents instilled a.
Lot of hard work ethics into you it.
Sounds like just because even with.
Talking about your 90 day you're just.
Like yeah i studied all this stuff i.
Know yeah and just everything you've.
Talked about so far it just seems you.
Extensively done research you take notes.
And you put work into it right so it.
Requires a lot of that as well.
Maybe if you want to speak on that.
Yeah i mean clearly it's not like follow.
My heart la-dee-da everything's gonna be.
Fine you need to have a plan.
You know like plan a plan b and but when.
But but i do believe that when you go.
For something you have to go all-in it's.
Kind of like i don't know have you guys.
Ever rock climbed or you know whatever.
Okay dude doing something we're pretty.
Much if you don't go all-in you're gonna.
Fall off you have to just make the leap.
And so for me that's what i needed to do.
In real life to see if it was gonna work.
Or not and i don't know maybe it is.
Something innate maybe it is well not.
Maybe definitely my parents trained me.
To be a very studious person a very.
Disciplined person but also i'm a high.
Achiever and i like progress i like.
Results and i like it and that a i mean.
Like that's just who i am it stressed me.
Out throughout school but i really liked.
It and i liked reaching my goal this.
Time it brings me a lot of joy so yeah i.
Mean you just got to be smart about it.
Cuz like it's not like i went for my.
Dreams and invested all my money or.
Their very little that i had that time.
Into these bags i didn't know what's.
Gonna happen i was still teaching i was.
Still hustling i was still i was doing.
Like craigslist jobs like i think if it.
Were back then i probably would have.
Been driving ubers and delivering post.
Mates like i would have just like done.
Everything and been very humble about it.
Until i could get where i wanted to be.
Right mm-hmm what do you tell yourself.
Like do you ever think about what could.
Potentially go wrong and do you try to.
Convince yourself like if it goes wrong.
Then this will happen or are you just.
More like kind of stubborn when it comes.
To those types of you know scenarios in.
Your head and you're like i will never.
Let that happen well things are always.
Gonna happen i'm so many terrible and.
Things have gone wrong in my life but i.
Immediately switch into problem-solving.
Mode there's no time to be sad about it.
It's like how do we fix this now so you.
Just got to be ready anyway if you're.
Not ready just start thinking really.
Hard how are you gonna fix this because.
I think the great thing about problems.
Is it makes me my most creative right.
True absolutely that's interesting you.
Say that you in the beginning that you.
Were very sensitive and emotional person.
But it's.
Your very logic base when it comes to.
Work that's a thing when it comes to.
Work i'm super logic base and super pom.
Solving but when it comes to people.
Judging my character i become like this.
Like really soft thing that just melts.
And dies that's so interesting to me cuz.
It's usually it's more almost one or the.
Other but it's kind of both yeah so like.
I think back to school and i feel like i.
Had a hard time socially because i don't.
Know like i i my high achieving self.
Made it hard for people to like me.
I guess i don't know but it definitely.
Wasn't cool.
It definitely wasn't cool and i always.
Struggled in the social scene and i.
Think that's where that whole the.
Comments affect me so much thing comes.
From because that's a social thing yeah.
But work-wise i've always been like i.
Don't care i'm just gonna go for it i'm.
Gonna do it whatever and that's.
Something you're confident i'm very.
Confident in my skills but when it comes.
To social stuff what about the social.
Stuff were you kind of uneasy about like.
Is it was it hard to make friends was it.
Regarding to regarding dating or was it.
Like interacting with teachers like was.
It okay teachers have always been fine.
Because like stood friends yeah i mean.
Like i don't know i i just see i'm even.
Struggling with it now i just like i.
Don't know okay i'll tell you about one.
Time so i i ran for a student government.
Freshman year of high school and um and.
Here's the thing i'm not well liked but.
I am well known back in that scene.
Because of all the things that i did and.
All the clubs i was in or whatever but.
When i was in student government which.
Is super clicky and super popular kids i.
Remember we were making a float for.
Homecoming and i was in charge of the.
Budget obviously and so we got walmart.
And trying to buy hairspray to like.
Spray down thing to make them stick up.
These like tissue papers and so i'm like.
Okay we should buy the generic brand.
Because it's cheaper than this like.
Tresemme or something like that and the.
Kids like they videotaped me and then.
They sent that video around it's telling.
Everyone that i was cheap.
Like i don't just like stuff like that.
Happening scars me and like i still.
Remember that so i don't know what that.
Is but i just have always struggled.
Socially so do you now buy the more.
Expensive okay like home goods marshalls.
Tv but i want saving money you know when.
It's time to buy a luxury you you can.
Splurge but like be smart when you can.
Be smart mm-hmm so we have some.
Questions from fans here oh wow okay yep.
We got one here from marianne she asks.
Would you ever consider running a.
Marathon no easy answer i ran a half.
Marathon that's still freezing.
I hate running like i hate it like i'll.
Do it but i do not enjoy it in any.
Aspect my legs hurt my mind's numb i.
Just like really don't like it yeah so.
No do you like it though no see i don't.
Like sports either because i don't like.
Being competitive physically like that i.
Guess like internally i'm like semi.
Competitive just based on my work stuff.
But not like that it overtakes my life.
But that's why i do really didn't like.
Playing tennis because it's always about.
Winning or losing and i just hated that.
I don't mind competing against myself.
But competing against other people's.
Stresses me out so what are other ways.
You compete against yourself oh you know.
Just like okay it just works for example.
Like the 90-day journey like i want to.
Hit this number how do i get there how.
Do i get there faster like what kind you.
Like that kind of stuff or like you know.
I lifted this much yesterday how much.
Can i squat today like that kind of.
Stuff but yeah when in computer why.
Don't you want to like i mean like you.
Were you valedictorian no were you.
Striving to be of course yeah that's the.
Best is that be stuff sats gpa i have no.
Idea yeah we weren't close clearly yeah.
Not even close.
Oh wow wouldn't it because i would have.
Assumed you're just incredibly.
Competitive yeah i think i i don't know.
Why i said that a lot of things about.
You baby yeah i think i am.
But i don't like you don't like making.
Other people lose basically no no and i.
Don't like losing you do like board.
Games or stuff like that.
Let them out a little bit not too much.
Not in portuguese i think it has to do.
With like work and stuff like that work.
Or like beating sales from last year and.
You know stuff like that.
Okay yeah i'm just confirming with the.
Gentleman that back because he sat up.
Straight when we started like talking.
About you being competitive.
You got another question here from.
Potter freak tips on always staying.
Motivated when working out okay you get.
This a lot oh yeah important one here's.
The thing you're not motivated if you.
Don't like what you're doing so like.
Pick a workout that's fun so i love.
Dancing i love pilates like when i go to.
My workout it feels like a treat not a.
Chore so that's number one.
Secondly maybe have an accountability.
Partner like a friend a sister boyfriend.
Whoever do it with you so now it becomes.
Like a date so that makes it fun again.
It's all about finding the joy in.
Working out and that to me is the secret.
And also finding something that you can.
Constantly get better at something that.
You can increase your skill in because.
It makes it exciting to come back me.
Like oh can i do this handstand am i a.
Little straighter did i run like 1.
Second faster than last time.
Like i think that's incredible yeah.
Having having being able to see.
Improvement yes is is very addicting.
Yeah it is progress is addictive but to.
Counter that a lot of people don't.
Improve very quickly and they get bored.
Or they get there just not patient or.
You know i think that's also evil yeah.
Most people if they don't stop seeing.
Results they just quit right so then it.
Happens a lot for a lot of people it.
Does and that's why i love doing all.
Sorts of workouts so sometimes we were.
Like oh why do you do yoga and pilates.
And dancing and all this other stuff.
It's because i like to it would be so.
Boring if i just did one thing all the.
Time but i think you just gonna find.
That level for you that makes it.
Exciting and interesting so whether.
That's the right variety or increasing.
Your skill level just find that thing.
That keeps you.
Coming back mm-hmm yeah okay well we got.
One more here from daniella she asks if.
I want to get in better shape not just.
Losing weight should i focus more on.
Workouts or on eating so in my.
Experience she waits you wonder she.
Better shape better workout right not.
Just losing weight just better shamp by.
Working out or eating okay so i guess we.
Don't know what she means by shape like.
Physical shape or just like healthy fit.
Shape i'm assuming she means like a.
Six-pack okay leaner so if we're talking.
About leaner you know i think when.
People say that abs are made in the.
Kitchen have you guys heard that it's.
Because all of us have a six-pack is no.
It's covered by a layer of fat so in.
Order to get rid of that fat it's gonna.
Be a lot of cardio a lot of hit workouts.
And then of course um a creating that.
Calorie deficit so that you can start.
Losing the fat on your body for me and.
My experience especially on this 90-day.
Journey a lot of it was food because.
I've always been working out i'll enjoy.
Working out but the food i had always.
Been overeating so focusing on the food.
I do a lot of lean protein along with.
Vegetables cauliflower everything that's.
How i replace my rice with and that's.
Helped a lot i know i know i know.
Cauliflower is great though i take a.
Cauliflower cauliflower polka yesterday.
For sweet finn oh my god you have to try.
It you have to actually i mean i would.
Try it.
But i've tried the cauliflower rice and.
From where uh well i mean i've had.
Pre-made ones i okay and you i mean the.
Thing is if you want right it's not.
Right it's not it's it's something it's.
Definitely something you know i will.
Replace rice dish in clarke rice no.
You're right it's just cauliflower just.
Cut yum nice.
Minced cauliflower it's not bad as a i.
Like it i think i think cauliflower rice.
Helped me on my journey yeah yeah yeah.
No i love rice but i can really easily.
Overeat that and it bloats me mm-hmm.
Unfortunately as an asian yeah yeah so.
Basically saying having a.
Better diet a diet is more important to.
Get apps and it is to get well i mean.
Everyone has abs to get rid of the layer.
Of fat it's not just working on it's.
Your diet it's it yeah it's both.
It's totally both because ironically.
Though couldn't you just not workout and.
Just starve yourself and you would get.
Abs but you'd probably die but i mean.
Like over time you see your abs right.
Like that's like starving people right.
There and you'll see ribs you know so.
That's like it's like that's not our you.
Know what i mean theoretically yes what.
About african children though because it.
Comes it starts to eat the muscle there.
Well that's what i was trying to see you.
Starve yourself okay you're canceled no.
Just kidding anyway yeah i think i've.
Heard that before though yeah you need.
To i've i mean i know for a fact that.
You don't lose that you can work out all.
You want but if you're eating bad it.
Doesn't really it no it totally counters.
It yeah it's so much easier to just eat.
A thousand extra calories and to burn a.
Thousand extra calories just how it is.
I was always like had the issue of like.
I think i'm i don't know if you.
Mentioned or not i don't know if we're.
Similar like i've always had like this.
Issue where i i like quantity of food.
Like you said you like to eat a lot yeah.
Like i would rather go to a place that.
Has like a twenty dollar like 16 out.
Like a big steak then to go to like a.
Fancy place that's like a filet mignon.
Kobe beef it's like this big like the.
Size of like a scallop i agree with you.
100%.
I love volume i want to fill my belly i.
Think it's a issue that i like the.
Feeling of feeling full me too.
That's why it's dangerous though guys.
Don't you think because i know i know i.
Can stop like a lot of times i'll go to.
Dinner have a appetizers and be like i'm.
Good but i'll keep going because you're.
So high achieving you just keep going.
You know i don't like to waste either.
He's also the asian in you right now you.
Guys are going with the generic brand.
What when the filet mignon is name brand.
What we want to save money that's what.
I'm saving.
Okay when you go to buffets uh-huh what.
Did your parents used to tell you how to.
Eat go to the get the expensive stuff.
Yeah.
Don't touch the rice crab legs only yeah.
Yeah yeah they would yell at me if i.
Want to talk but i still get rice like a.
Buffet that's how much i like rice it's.
It's not it's a baby rice is amazing.
I love brown rice though like i.
Naturally like brown rice is chewy and.
Good.
Do you like brown or white white but i.
Could eat i eat rice mexican rice even.
Forbidden rice cool well um we learned a.
Lot learn a lot good yeah we learned.
That everyone has abs deep down.
Laughter.
Different ways to achieve it and you.
Lost 16 pounds and it's harder for girls.
