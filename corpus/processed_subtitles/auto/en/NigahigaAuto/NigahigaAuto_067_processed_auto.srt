Is ryan higa and i'm going to be.
Surviving all by myself in the arctic.
With nothing but the clothes on my back.
And chest in arms and pretty much all my.
Clothes while teaching you the necessary.
Tips and techniques to survive in the.
Freezing arctic with nothing but the.
Clothes on my back right now we're in.
The arctic this is no place for fun and.
Games hold on you don't know what are.
You lost out here the arctic terrain is.
Completely unforgiving if you get lost.
Out here you'll be sorry the arctic.
Terrain won't forgive you because of the.
Unforgiving this do not want to get lost.
Out here trust me if you do up.
Whoa one of the toughest parts of the.
Arctic is actually just just walking.
Around because of all the snow you're.
Gonna need something to help you not.
Sink into the snow while you're walking.
Right now i'm going to teach you how to.
Make your own homemade snow shoes we're.
After get this big ski off when you're.
Lost in the wild you have to be.
Resourceful and make do with what you.
Have so let's make your snowshoes what.
You want to do first close your two.
Daily tennis racquets from your jacket.
I place them beneath your feet this is.
Gonna be like the base of your shoe and.
Actually gonna need something to tie the.
Rackets to your shoes you're gonna take.
The laces from your big ski and well.
Unfortunately for me it seems this big.
He has no shoelaces and you definitely.
Don't want to use the shoelaces from.
Your actual shoe because that'll make.
Your shoes look weird and you definitely.
Want that in the arctic so what you're.
Gonna want to do from here is put the.
Two extra shoelaces you can't run in.
Your jacket and use these to tie the.
Rackets to your shoe like so this.
Technique may look very complicating and.
Difficult to understand and it is.
All right now you made your snowshoes.
Nice and snug.
Time to get moving because we got a lot.
Of ground to cover let's go.
The ancient natives traveled great.
Distances with their snowshoes some say.
They even went as far as going to thee.
And that's about enough for today you.
Don't ever want to dehydrate yourself in.
A snowy terrain like this one.
Well the biggest parts of survival if.
Not the biggest staying hydrated.
Contrary to most belief in other.
Survival shows when you're thirsty and.
Desperate you never want to drink your.
Own pee.
Because it's sterile and absolutely.
Disgusting what you want to do is just.
Eat some snow from the ground it might.
Sound crazy.
The ancient natives really believed that.
Snow acted is a good substitute for.
Water when in desperate times eating.
Snow in a terrain like this may bring.
Your body temperature to an unsafely low.
Level that's a good thing because then.
You won't sweat and you won't dehydrate.
Again don't want to do is just eat.
Random snow because it might be dirty to.
Be safe always look for the yellow snow.
Like this one right here chances are.
This is someone's pea and as you know.
Pea is very safe to drink because it's.
Sterile so what we're gonna do here is.
Just scoop a little bit out from the.
Middle and uh - okay that's not penal.
Never drink from an open carton because.
It may have mono i'll have to find.
Shelter soon because night is coming and.
It's only gonna get colder from here the.
Cool way to tell how much time you have.
Left before nightfall is by knowing the.
Temperature see the ancient natives.
Didn't have watches like you and i so.
What they would do is use temperature as.
A measurement of time the colder it gets.
The later it is basically the technique.
They use is actually pretty simple what.
You do is you pull out your cell phone.
And what you're gonna do here just find.
The weather app it's already it's not.
Really moving because of my gloves -.
You're getting really it's pretty.
Difficult right now my gloves are making.
It nearly impossible to open the weather.
App and i can't take off my gloves.
Because my hands are cold and the last.
Thing you want in the arctic is to be.
Uncomfortable you're still unable to.
Open your weather app because your.
Gloves what you want to do then is pull.
Out your daily jacket thermometer and.
Basically use a thermometer as a sort of.
Stylus or writing tool so you can open.
Your weather app the ancient natives.
This technique from the nintendo ds as.
You can see yeah almost no problems at.
All it's working phenomenally.
Phenomenally is a big word there you go.
As you can see it actually this is the.
Coldest i've ever seen it before it's.
Negative 1 degrees celsius at for you.
Americans i believe that anywhere.
Between 20 to 75 degrees for googly.
That's really cold so we really need to.
Get moving but as a day drags on i find.
Neither food nor shelter my feet are.
Starting to bark my nipples meta parting.
And i'm going to think i bit off a.
Little more than i could chew this time.
You know being out here all this time.
And it's only been like 30 minutes but.
I'm starting to feel like giving up it's.
Hard to lose hope but then i remember.
Well my grandfather's only son of my.
Dad's side always told me son it's an.
Ice box you open it get what you want.
Close it i'll stop poisoning electricity.
And after all this time i never really.
Understood what he was talking about.
Until right now he was talking about.
Here he was talking about the arctic how.
I should never give up i should.
Persevere how i need to never back down.
And just never give up get out of here.
Buddy get out of here get it out of here.
Yeah.
