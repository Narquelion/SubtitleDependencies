Hey guys so as many of you already know.
I am not the most musically gifted.
Person but i do love music and recently.
I've been trying to teach myself how to.
Play the piano not with real lessons or.
Like with a teacher or anything i've.
Been just like youtubing people playing.
The piano and i just like copy their.
Hands pretty sure that's how people.
Learn right honestly i don't even know.
How to read notes but anyway whenever i.
Try to practice playing the piano my.
Dogs for whatever is it it doesn't.
Matter where they are in the house they.
Come and they just they just go crazy.
They just start barking so loud that i.
Can't even hear the piano i mean that.
Literally like scares me sometimes it.
Makes me not want to play it see i don't.
Know if you can tell how loud those.
Barks are from the video but trust me it.
Is loud and the thing is if i ignore.
Them and i keep playing roku for.
Whatever reason it gets even louder by.
Doing this like you just like turned.
Into this really high pitch like cat see.
I don't know if it's because i play the.
Piano so well that they want to sing.
Along or because i'm so bad that they.
They want me to stop probably probably.
That but regardless they will not let me.
Practice so one day i decided if they're.
Not gonna let me practice the piano then.
I'm just gonna turn them into one so.
Everything you're about to hear is 100%.
Marlee and roku barking and doing that.
High-pitched cat scream thing i'm not.
Sure why i did this but it's um it's.
Done this is the dog piano.
