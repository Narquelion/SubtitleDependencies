Hey guys i recently got pulled over for.
The first time in a long time for going.
Six miles per hour over the speed limit.
True story when it comes to being pulled.
Over i'm either really lucky or really.
Good at getting out of getting a ticket.
I've been pulled over a total of four.
Times now and each time i got off with a.
Warning this last time was probably the.
Stupidest reason i've ever gotten pulled.
Over but i have to admit the first three.
Times i kind of deserved it the first.
Time i got pulled over it was because i.
Just didn't completely stop at a stop.
Sign okay something that didn't really.
Stop at all at the stop sign i kind of.
Drifted what tokyo drift was big at the.
Time yo all right i mean the second time.
I kind of ran a red light and i come on.
It was an emergency i had to poop there.
Should be a special light for that there.
Should be a brown light well i mean i.
Guess sometimes green does work yo all.
Right and the third time i mean it was.
Even a big deal i just kind of stole the.
Toyota oh my god go go go we wasn't even.
Chasing i stole this toyota.
Yolo i deserve a ticket right now for.
Saying yolo three times in one video for.
Now anyway i've had a lot of reasons to.
Hate the police just like everyone else.
I'm not going to because could you.
Imagine how much it already sucks to be.
A policeman i mean everyone hates on the.
Net cake wrappers for example they're.
One of the most influential people in.
This world and yet they're always.
Hitting on the police in their song.
Especially for whatever reason at the.
End of a verse right before the chorus.
Music.
But i'm not a rapper clearly back to the.
Top like i was saying before i got.
Pulled over a few nights ago and gotten.
That up with a warning once again i know.
So many people who still get tickets for.
Stupid reasons like this so like i said.

Probably just doing it wrong so i'm.
Gonna be giving you guys some tips on.
How not to get tickets these are the top.
Three things that you shouldn't do when.
You get pulled over don't ever try to.
Convince him that he's wrong or you made.
A mistake.
Do you know why i pulled you over dope.
Actually i really don't because i'm very.
Sure i was waiting 35 do not make any.
Excuses unless if it's an emergency like.
Your cat is flying do you know why i.
Pulled you over me i mean it's not my.
Fault i couldn't see the speed limit.
