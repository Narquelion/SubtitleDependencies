Muster up hey guys and happy new year so.
This is the first video of the year i.
Know i'm a little bit late but as usual.
I went back home to hawaii for the.
Holidays and i had a lot of time to.
Really reflect on myself like most.
People do around new year's and i.
Realized that i need to make some.
Changes most of you guys already know.
I've been doing youtube for such a long.
Time and during that time i would say.
95% of the content was always relatively.
Clean i mean not like disney channel.
Clean but i've never shown like drugs.
And alcohol or anything too sexual i.
Haven't even cursed on this channel.
Without getting bleep at least recently.
I'm gonna done something when i was.
Younger i mean i can't even see the s.
Word and they say that on tv now you.
Know the word see what i'm talking about.
It's a bunch of bull this is what.
Happens when i try to curse here not.
Even my choice son of one holy oh.
Surprise mother i guess i can curse see.
What i have to go through it's time for.
A change you see this this is why i get.
Censored this is p g mo that's what i am.
On right now it's on look at justin.
Bieber miley cyrus even selena gomez.
They all switched off their pg switch i.
Went from clean innocent stars to these.
Drug using bucket peeing sexy sexual sex.
Superstars and at first everyone thought.
Including myself well that they're just.
Ruining their career and now they're.
Doing better than ever because that is.
What people want which is why it is my.
Time to break for you by the end of this.
Video i'm gonna be switching this off.
For good i'm gonna kill myself i don't.

To be a average welcome to how to be.
Edge i'm rich yeah i introduced myself.
Twice but that's the first lesson of.
Being edge you ain't afraid of the rule.
Edgy people will do its normal we don't.
Do what society tells us to do i mean.
Look at me.
Look what i'm wearing right now see this.

I'm most importantly if you want to be.
Edging you gotta have tats rather sleep.
Thank you every edgy person you can.
Think of as tats and i know you guys.
Think you know what i'm gonna say but no.
These tats these are real these are real.
Temporary tattoos and they're all edging.
These are tattoos that nobody gives but.
This chinese character right here it's.
In japanese i can't even read korean.
Tell me how many people are brave enough.
To get something like that.
How about this one a lot of people get.
This tattoo because they love their mom.
But i got this one from when i punched.
My mom in the heart pinch or even all of.
These so angie the story behind these.
Tasks didn't even happen yet it's the.
Story of when i got a copyright claim in.

All right now as you look the part and.
Dress the part here's the final step.
Before you can turn this stop lay off.
And start saying words like well you got.
To do is act the part is angie people we.

Change for all the people that thought i.
Was serious look the truth is i am.
Getting older and usually with people in.
The entertainment industry as they get.
Older they intentionally trying to get.
Edgy or so that they can appeal to an.
Older audience and honestly i just i.
Don't want to do that look if my stuff.
Gets edged ear over time because i'm.
Getting older that's fine but i'm not.
Gonna force it just to appeal to a new.
Audience i'm not getting edgy i'm not.
