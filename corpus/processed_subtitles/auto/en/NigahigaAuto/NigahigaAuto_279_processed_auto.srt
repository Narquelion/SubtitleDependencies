Okay so this video is something i should.
Have done a very long time ago but what.
Can i say i'm a procrastinator i'm sure.
You've noticed but almost every single.
Youtuber other than me has like really.
Good branding on their channels you know.
Like they all have those really nice.
Channel banners and updated playlists.
And logos and tuka but most importantly.
They all have this channel trailer that.
When someone new comes to their channel.
They can see this really cool epic.
Trailer of what their channel is all.
About so that people get excited to.
Subscribe to them yeah after nine years.
Of being on youtube i still don't have.
One of those i think for the longest.
Time i had my draw my life video as the.
Trailer i'm just terrible at branding in.
Fact my banner is still one of the.
Default banners that youtube offers you.
When you first make a channel i mean to.
Be fair it is a nice banner i mean those.
Autofocus colorful light ball things are.
Actually really nice that's why i picked.
It because it's a new year i'm gonna.
Start the year off right after 9 years.
Of youtube procrastination no more i.
Finally have a channel trailer confetti.
I mean it is two weeks into the year so.
I guess i kind of procrastinated on this.
Video and actually i still don't have a.
Logo yet i haven't been updating my.
Playlist and as for my channel banner i.
Know you know what my channel banner is.
Fine who cares if it's a default banner.
It's nice i love those autofocus.
Colorful ball things.
Thanks ryan we love you too what the i.
Started making videos in o six didn't.
Think much of it just did some lip sings.
Random skits you know it was just me and.
My friends having fun.
I had no idea other people will be.
Watching i still don't know why people.
Watch but i'm thankful for it you know.
It changed my life you know i went from.
Being this depressed bullied kid who.
Just wanted to be someone else to being.
Confident just happy to be me and that's.
What this channel is all about you know.
Being yourself being different being.
Weird if you want to put on a wig and.
Lip-sync to the song barbie girl you'd.
Do it if you want to go and share.
Command me out of your hands but it's.
Always been your childhood dream then.
Make it happen if you want to be a.
Singer even though you've been told.
Countless times that you can't sing it.
Doesn't matter because the only person.
That can stop you it's you because it's.
Never too late to be yourself are you.
Done because i mean nobody really asked.
You for your whole life store what do.
You mean i thought this whole thing was.
A clip from an old interview or.
Something nope just part of the trailer.
And you're still talking over all the.
Best parts well i mean i was just trying.
To make it a little more inspirational.
And didn't even make sense it just means.
That it's not too late to do what you.
Want to it's also not too late for you.
To leave because i mean i'm the one.
Doing the things so you know if you.
Don't mind hey you want to press it.
