With him like ten minutes ago so kind of.
Just like a whole big waste of time you.
Know i guess we'll see what he has in.
Mind.
Right now with the shortage in the all.
The mountains hide you think where to.
Pull it up with his location right now.
Oh all right i'm here at the spot and i.
Have no idea where he is all right here.
We go.
Like they say in french adios amigos ah.
Here we go.
How you doing sean that's it yeah what's.
That you're not even gonna wear like a.
Fake parachute i'm not even gonna wear a.
Fake pair of shoes really crocks crikey.
Mate.
It's not even the same accent sean and i.
Have a long boring uneventful walk ahead.
Of us before we reach our first stop so.
It's a good thing we have multiple.
Angles beautiful shots of nature and.
Very important life-changing questions.
To feel that time hey you know the.
Survival shows where they cuts a bunch.
Of shots of and angles of people walking.
And whatnot yeah why well don't you.
Think like in that one wide shot that.
They have don't you have a one like wait.
Where's all the cameramen you know do.
You think with all the different angles.
And whatnot you'd see like a few people.
Here and there and hey look we're at the.
End of the wide if we can just walk in.
Silence now yes you're right you could.
Catch johnny boy yes.
So we've been out here for about three.
Or four minutes now and i think i'm.
About ready to go home now all right.
Sean here's our first challenge what we.
Got to keep heading in this direction so.
What we're gonna need to do is climb.
This cliff right here make it to the top.
And push forward he's there hiss that's.
So dangerous i'm not gonna climb that.
Sean we have to climb this you just told.
Me that we're gonna go on looks like a.
Little hike i didn't think we're gonna.
Do anything crazy like this can't we.
Just like walk around it i mean if you.
Want to hike another 20 miles that way.
And spend another day out here i suppose.
We could do that but if you don't want.
To do that we have to climb this cliff.
This is crazy sean i've been a survival.
Expert for about four five maybe even.
Six minutes now i'm not gonna let.
Anything bad happen to you you have.
Nothing to worry about.
Would you trust me no oh well then we.
Are in quite the cucumber dipped in.
Vinegar aren't we that's a pickle by the.
Way you know what a pickle is the.
Ancient natives had pickles god i really.
Don't want to spend another day with you.
Fine yeah let's do it.
Oh all right johnny boy that's a spirit.
Climbing a cliff is no easy task it's.
Incredibly dangerous and should not be.
Attempted without a professional however.
If it's your first time rock climbing.
You'll have beginner's luck and bad.
Should be enough all right i guess all.
That's left to do is to just go in and.
Climb this mountain then shouldn't we.
Like for a rope or something up there to.
Like give us support in case we fall you.
Know what gonna be a survival expert.
Yourself good cat sean i almost forgot.
About this all right so whenever you're.
Climbing a cliff or a mountain or any.
Kind of really dangerous heights where.
You could possibly fall what you want to.
Do especially if you have a bunch of.
Rope like so pull it up like this bunch.
It up just like that and then you're.
Just gonna what but yeah just like that.
And and then you should be good to go.
Because the last thing you want when.
You're climbing a cliff is using any.
Kind of rope you don't want to mess with.
It and then all of a sudden you get all.
Tangled and then you know you might.
Mistake it for some kind of snake and.
You're like oh no snake let me let go of.
This club yeah i'm about a hundred.
Percent sure that he's never climbed.
Anything ever in his life but what are.
My options.
I either i'm this cliff and possibly die.
Or not climb the cliff and have to spend.
Another day with him so.
Yeah i think i'd rather risk dying so.
John has no idea but uh i've actually.
Never climbed a cliff before i mean i.
Didn't lie i have rock climbed but it.
Was one of those cliffs with the.
Colorful rocks and the people voiced you.
Up and stuff so it's a little bit safer.
But i've never actually climbed a cliff.
Even with that rock wall i only made it.
About a quarter of the way up then i got.
Scared.
I do have an uncle named cliff though.
There's that all right so i'm gonna go.
Up there first just remember whatever.
You do do not look down and do not panic.
That's one of the biggest mistakes.
People make in the wild so just follow.
After me let me go up here we go never.
You're rock climbing you must always be.
Patient and take it one step at a time.
Make one wrong move and it could all be.
Over i was a really close one oh almost.
Fell on all the way back oh oh god.
You okay i look down i don't like.
Heights i should have looked down what.
Do i do john i know i should have done.
This sean hill but you're not even that.
High right now he can just walk right.
Back down you're not even at the steep.
Part okay i just hurry up just calm down.
Just calm down okay come here help okay.
That's a hug me it's okay okay we'll.
Just slide slide down the hill okay.
We're here right here okay okay just.
Give me a minute okay all right a new.
Plan i just thought of it.
Since the rope is still up there you.
Know actually only one of us needs to go.
Up there andy and once you get up there.
You can help pull the other person up.
With the rope okay sounds good.
Right so when you get up there what i.
Want you to do with me yeah why do i.
Have to go up because i'm heavier what.
You're not even that much heavier than.
Me and even if you were how is it better.
For the lighter person to pull up the.
Heavier person science look i'll tell.
You what okay as you're going up.
Whichever way you go i'll be right below.
You so just in case you fall i'll be.
Right there to take off my bag and throw.
It on the ground so you have something.
To fall on and you'll be fine sound good.
I guess let's just get this over with.
All right let's do this good luck my new.
Plan seems to be working almost.
Perfectly.
It seems shawn historian to fatigue as.
He approaches the talk well i have to.
Think fast and come up with a back-up.
Plan just in case you get stuck.
Music.
Oh oh oh my god i made it thank god.
Yes well that was awesome sean i was.
Absolutely phenomenal how'd you get up.
Here yeah you're just down there oh yeah.
See things so funny you're gonna laugh.
At this so at the end that i thought.
You're gonna fall i went to go gather.
Some leaves and you know brush and some.
Rocks for you to fall on and in the.
Process on the side of the mountain i.
Found this trail that comes all the way.
To the top this is not funny we didn't.
Need to climb at all.
Yeah funny hey you have to check this.
Out this view is amazing.
Get over here sean and i enjoy a moment.
Of nature i realized that it's the.
Perfect time for a deep and emotional.
Part of the show.
I got father would have loved to see.
This right now all right yeah before he.
Passed he's to always take us camping.
And fishing and he just loved everything.
About nature so i really wish he could.
Have been here yeah i know i can.
Definitely relate to that you know i've.
Always wanted to bring my own father as.
Well he's the he's the same way as a.
Grandfather and you know recently he.
Passed so sorry no it's it's fine it's.
It is what it is but i just i really.
Wish that one day he could really just.
Be out here with me.
See this hey i think he already is what.
What you're not my father.
No not me i meant like his spirit its.
Spirit what are you that's not funny you.
Trying to say that my father's dead what.
You just said he passed yeah i asked him.
To come out here and he said thanks son.
But i'll have to pass i would spend an.
Entire day with you in the wild for your.
Stupid little show but i'd much rather.
Be dead than do that something like that.
I don't know i'm not a good impression -.
So he has a weird accident but my point.
Is is that he's not dead it's a really.
Messed up thing to say actually your.
Comedy is a little bit too dark for me.
Anyway we better get moving before it.
Actually gets dark out we don't want to.
End up like your grandfather right right.
You get it cuz you're because if when he.
Gets dark the predator might attack us.
Anyway my dad um yes i get it.
No i don't think you get it because you.
Didn't want laughing isn't funny - okay.
Then.
So we're mad sometimes in the wild.
Things can get a little frustrating and.
I'm starting to suspect that sean's.
Getting a little irritable mean yeah i'm.
Pretty annoyed i mean aren't you guys.
Sean's irritable nurses probably due to.
The hunger settling in if we don't find.
Nutrients for him soon he may catch a.
Bad case of the hangers and literally.
Starve to death.
All right so we're actually really close.
To the extraction point we just got to.
Climb one more hill but if we're gonna.
Make it all that way we have to find.
Some food in nutrients for sean before.
He starts to death what i'm not even.
Starving i'm not even hungry but luckily.
For him i know exactly where to look and.
I'm not gonna let that happen so come on.
Ate like two hours ago before we started.
This and you're in the wild you have to.
Be resourceful and know where to look it.
May take some time but you have to be.
Persistent and keep your cool can expect.
Food to just magically fall out of a.
Tree check this out.
Right here and that is how you do it see.
A lot of people don't think to look up.
In the tree for food but it's actually.
Very common for people to just get a.
Bucket of chicken bring it out to the.
Forest and then just sit no oh what's.
Wrong no why who the f one of them has.
No skin who the greedy but just comes in.
Here.
He's all the skin illegal you know the.
Driest late pointless pointless what.
Kind of rock really upset i guess that's.
Just like his pet peeve or something i.
Don't know maybe the dude just really.
Loves fried chicken skin i mean it's.
Common sense it's common courtesy basic.
Manners you know like if you're gonna if.
You're gonna leave a bucket of chicken.
On a branch and a tree in the middle.
Than the matter mountains tell me all.
The skin or just the skin or at least.
Leave some gravy or something why ask me.
Hey you're right yeah no i'm i'm good.
Now so i'm i listen i am so sorry about.
That showing off no no it's fine that's.
A totally reasonable way to react to not.
Having chicken skin on your chicken no.
No no i know it's a natural reaction.
That everybody anybody would have but i.
Should know better than to overreact you.
Never want to over act in the wild.
That's one of the basic rules never lose.
Your cool and i did so for that i'm.
Sorry.
What come on now what we really don't.
Have to we got to do this shawn.
If you want to go home let's just get.
This over with come on i'll bring it in.
Fine.
Hey hey what what are you doing i had to.
Be sure sure of what you didn't take the.
Skins and you didn't and now i can trust.
You for life come on let's go.
The nevada mountains are incredibly.
Dangerous but with the right technique.
And knowledge and maintaining your cool.
Your pressive ear choppers right over.
This hill this is the end.
Shawn really really impressed me today.
And he's definitely under my respect not.
Because of the bravery he showed or the.
Endurance that he had the entire trip.
But because he didn't take the skins and.
In the end that's all that really.
Matters isn't it.
I'm ready i can't believe we made it.
Well you guys got an extra battery or a.
Charger what's all of this where's the.
Helicopter oh yeah you know about that i.
Don't think you know this but you know.
The very beginning with the whole.
Helicopter dropping me off yeah we faked.
That yeah i know yeah there was no.
Actual helicopter there's no helicopter.
Wait so you're telling me that we're.
Gonna have yeah we gotta walk back.
