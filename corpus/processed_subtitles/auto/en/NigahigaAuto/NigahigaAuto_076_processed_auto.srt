Hey guys so valentine's they just had.
And once again for the third straight.
Year i spent it by myself.
Thank you thank you thank you don't stop.
Stop i know i know it's i'm just kidding.
Guys like i tell you guys every single.
Year there's nothing wrong with being.
Sing every single year around that day i.
Always see the same pose on twitter.
Facebook myspace is about myspace about.
People complaining about being single.
I've been single for a long time i'm not.
Gonna lie sometimes i miss being in a.
Relationship actually around valentine's.
Day or when one of my friends starts.
Dating someone new or if i watch like a.
Really good movie action movie because.
I'm a man i don't know who nicholas.
Sparks is i mean romance and movies.
Always makes it seem so much better than.
It really especially in movies like the.
Notebook i'm gonna be reading these.
Stories about our love and hopes that.
You remember them i walk to remember.
We're gonna get everything on your list.
Done before you die dear john here john.
Hi okay so maybe i didn't watch to your.
Job but i'm assuming it's somewhat.
Similar this is how those movies were.
Look in the real world.
And i know those are just move the.
Example but that's what a lot of people.
Think romance is really like like you.
Know move so if you're single and you're.
Sad about it i'm here to tell you that.
You're not missing out on much because.
This is what romance looks like in.
Reality oh my god i i'm so sorry you.
Like cactuses it's crazy i love cactuses.
Like cactuses whatever loser i went back.
To the very spot that we'd run into each.
Other and waited there hoping our paths.
Would cross again but she never came.
Until one day hey it took me four whole.
Minutes to find her on facebook at the.
Same time 1 2 you didn't either okay.
Okay bye.
Music.
So um everyone gets their girl flowers.
But i remember the first time we met oh.
You remember that i'm gonna put this.
Cactus right here so that every time you.
Go to sleep you remember the first time.
We met remembered what.
When we first met i was spitting cacti.
Practices cacti but it's still sweet.
That you remember i'm gonna put this.
Cactus right here so you know what it.
Feels like to see nice to somebody with.
Prickly legs shave them.

No no how long should i wait to start.
Dating other people at least oh i love.
You youtube but i'm still gonna date.
Other people.
Taylor tea tea okay so that last one was.
Obviously a joke i would never say.
Teehee in real life that's so lame look.
In all fairness to all those couples out.
There this is coming from a single.
Person's perspective and in all honesty.
I'm probably only saying these things.
Because i haven't met the right person.
Yet i truly believe that once you find.
The one and you really do fall in love.
Every single expectation you ever had.
Will become a reality so to everyone out.
There that is looking for real romance.
Don't give up just yet just give up.
