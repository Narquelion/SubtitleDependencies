You guys are like like sisters well you.
Know he gets jealous when you know.
Ryan's friends are here and you guys and.
You know and you know what too though i.
Knew this is gonna happen because.
Personality-wise that's a lie.
Oh man this is just like a roast session.
I don't get jealous and when his friends.
Come over just you.
I think it's cool it's cool i think it's.
Cool you know you sound real jealous.
Right do what was that what i saw.
What do you mean i saw dan show us yeah.
This is me excited about today okay so.
Let's get into it before you guys start.
Fighting again let's start with the.
Easiest question that and the most.
Common thing that we got online since we.
Announced that you're gonna be here oh.
No is there gonna be a broad question.
It's it's not it we gotta go are.
Specific okay let's go into specifics.
Then okay and you know what i'm not even.
Ask you that until later let's talk.
About something really current yeah.
Let's talk a little bit about how we.
Started talking again recently and that.
Is about the playoffs you asked a ball.
Player yes.
So i told ryan i've been watching my.
Basketball and i said you know you flirt.
With the idea of talking about sports on.
Your podcast so not just basketball i.
Know you're a fan of wrestling i am but.
I'm not a fan of watching it of watching.
Wrestling yeah you're only okay i like.
To wrestle right i don't like watching.
Wrestling but you like i like like watch.
Yeah yeah okay i mixed i sorry yeah you.
Like watching and then a you like.
Watching nba yeah and there you know.
Sports kind of niche your fans that.
Don't watch it don't really relate when.
You're talking about correct they don't.
Usually relate yeah yeah so not a lot of.
Them at least right so when you tweet.
About it you talk about it there's like.
Crickets you.
Most people i would say especially on.
Twitter that's not the audience for it.
There's some people especially because i.
Came out as a spurs fan a while ago so i.
Have a bunch of like certain followers.
That are spurs fans that respond but.
Other than that it's like nobody cares.
Oh yeah kauai just hit that game winner.
In game seven.
I could tweet it but nobody on my feet.
Would carry would care if i tagged like.
Raptors and canadians or something like.
There's no nobody would care i mean what.
You wanted me to talk about that here.
And i told you that i don't think most.
People care about that stuff here i at.
Least so i'm convinced that people would.
Care maybe not paco but but playoffs are.
Coming because it's so big everyone's.
Talking about it like yeah regular.
Layout sir i don't think people care.
Right like yeah you know there's 82.
Games in the regular season that's a lot.
Of games yeah and sometimes they play.
Back-to-back and to be honest i check it.
Every day even during the regular season.
I said oh i'm a big fan and and i guess.
You know ryan's also a big fan um but.
The conversation was more like you know.
People might not track the stats or as.
Much or like follow certain teams.
Because not every city as a team yeah.
And you know youtube is global luckily.
Nba is becoming a little bit more global.
But what i want to say is like sports in.
Itself can be relatable maybe not sure.
The data or or certain players.
Franchises but just the what you can.
Learn from sports how sports can inspire.
You you know to work hard and so it's.
More of a reflection of like our culture.
Our you know our daily life and how we.
Can succeed right paka.
Yeah i just don't like that you said can.
Inspire you and you looked at me and.
Then said to work harder you try to pick.
A fight again i'm sharing eye contact.
And it just so happened that i wanted to.
Give you some inspiration i knew this.
Was gonna happen.
I just michael i know you work hard i.
Don't know what it is when he puts his.
Mind to something he gets it done it's.
Just getting him to put his mind into.
Something yeah but does he put his mind.
On a lot of too many.
Things is better not really i'm i have.
An addictive personality so if i really.
Like something then i just go hundred.
Percent into it that's good yeah i mean.
It's good if there's no gets bored.
Easily.
Yeah jump he jumps into different things.
Like he'll be into basketball one week.
Or maybe more than a week then you'll be.
Into stand-up or whatever it is yeah you.
Don't know me alright if you know me.
When's the first time we met internet.
Icon nope that is a no what are you why.
Yeah movie man uh-oh my name is continue.
With your sports analogy it was getting.
Somewhere good it sounds like you're.
Being most sarcastic no it's um we're.
Good.
It was getting somewhere good i mean.
What i said what i need what i said.
About it but you know i get what you're.
Saying.
I just think like even like when i'm if.
It were like me and paco and we'll right.
We're i mean the most regular people on.
It unless the guess is somebody like you.
They don't even watch basketball it's.
Hard to like even bring it up and talk.
About it when even though i as much as i.
Like it it's like they probably didn't.
See any of the games or really know.
Who's on whose team right i mean you.
Don't really know i mean i know only.
Like the stars names none of them yeah.
But you know when in the playoffs like.
When kauai hit that yeah did you know.
That everybody move memes pape up for me.
Yeah means like when damien hit that.
That three-pointer up from like 35 feet.
I mean people are gonna see that yeah.
And you can talk about that but you know.
In the playoffs there's more of those.
Happy accidents where people are like.
Hidden big shots and the pressures on.
That's the thing about sports it's.
Competitive there's high stakes you know.
These these players go through crazy.
Amounts of pressure they're playing back.
You know on monday wednesday.
Friday-sunday like they're playing four.
Games a week and it's just like you're.
Seeing people at the top of their game.
Go at it and like whether it's be sports.
Regular sports you know you watch movies.
Tv like you're getting the top athletes.
Or performers and they're just there in.
The moment and it's it's transcendent of.
Just.
Oh i'm not a basketball fan like you can.
Respect and appreciate yeah you know.
Seeing like transcendent performers like.
Kawhi leonard yeah for instance because.
Like no matter what you do to be like.
The top 1% of what you do requires a lot.
Of hard work and dedication and you know.
A lot of hours people don't see right at.
Like a few seconds of glory yeah that.
They all do see ya so i guess trying a.
Segue into that you know you were one of.
The top 1% of youtubers thrown amount of.
Time yeah but like you know i mean you.
Still had a very solid foothold in the.
Youtube game you know like a well-known.
Amongst a lot of creators and fans and i.
Guess you know out of nowhere it kind of.
You kind of just like fell off the face.
Of the earth were yeah you like.
Disappeared i didn't know that yeah.
There's people were starting to put your.
Name right next to the like you know.
Bigfoot and loch ness monster jumba.
That's when you started acting right.
Right so it it went through many stages.
Of like you know from you to to wanting.
To do acting yeah and then transitioning.
From like you know i'm gonna take a.
Break from this career chase and and.
Just focus on you know family and in my.
Life so from when you were like at the.
Top of your game cuz you didn't it's not.
Like you became all like although some.
Kev's irrelevant and he's gonna stop it.
Was when you were still getting tons of.
Views you were still very popular you.
Just want to go a different direction i.
Would say so and and um and this goes.
Back this is gonna be like you know a.
Friend moment for us - but you were.
Doing youtube and you like we had.
Private conversations where you're like.
Yo i'm committed to youtube like this is.
My bread and butter like i don't need to.
Do the whole la thing i don't need to do.
Movies i don't need to act.
I just love youtube and i was like and.
That's that's amazing like well i i.
Wanna like see like like what's you know.
On the other side right like i i had so.
Much enjoyment on youtube.
But i i felt like i felt a sense of like.
Harmony.
Some may not be the best word but it.
Felt like that you were gonna be able to.
Walk that path and because i was like.
Your quoteunquote brother like best.
Friend at the time i was like or one of.
Your best friends i know you know so i.
Was like yo i i get to still like.
Experience it through you so like if i.
Don't do that at least i like i know.
That you get to live that life and i.
Could still like connect with you and be.
Like dude what's it like and so i was.
Able to like confidently go this other.
Direction right adie i mean i didn't.
Know that but i mean i thought i'm at.
The time like i remembered that we.
Talked about it and you did seem a.
Little like oh no you were just kind of.
Tired of being kept in a box like kind.
Of like you had this persona on line.
Right you you i mean you had a surgeon.
Persona i mean the same way i did up.
Until very recently where you felt like.
You couldn't say certain things and you.
Couldn't act a certain way and then you.
Kind of wanted to get away from that.
From what i remember.
At least i i mean there was a there was.
Some of that um i felt like i had.
Youtube i was making videos trying to do.
It with other things that i was.
Interested in i was in la so there was.
There was a lot of influences right like.
Meeting older actors and getting their.
Perspective and and just seeing you know.
I'm i grew up in houston as an asian.
American which we'll have a conversation.
About because you guys are from hawaii.
But i was always a minority and i was.
Always like told i can't do things like.
You know i played soccer so i was always.
The only asian kid and i was i tried out.
For club my first year and i was on the.
E team that's the so they have a b c d e.
So e is like division three or four it's.
Like the lowest division and i didn't.
Even like there were so many kids i.
Tried out so there did they're basically.
Just grouping kids and like you know.
That they had their favorite so they put.
Them on a and b but i was on the e team.
Mike and i was like dude i don't even.
Think they saw me play uh-huh and i was.
Like the only asian kid at the trial and.
You know fast forward six years i'm on.
The eighteen.
Like i'm on the a-team i've built a.
Relationship with trainers that are.
World class like well not world clap but.
They played professionally and they're.
Now training and they were like kept.
Mentoring me and eventually i became on.
A team and it was just through you know.
Like proving that i'm not just you know.
The scrawny asian kid like that needs to.
Be a class but but going into like.
Entertainment doing youtube like a lot.
Of my videos were about being asian.
American and stereotypes and and and you.
Know i grew up in a culture where we.
Were you know especially asian men like.
Do you masculine you know so so i think.
Wanting to like like as a youtuber like.
My audience was growing up as well i was.
Growing up and just wanting to have a.
Presence on on a more traditional.
Platform so that like people who are.
Like oh asian americans don't belong in.
Hollywood or asian americans don't.
Belong on tv or if you're gonna be on tv.
You're just gonna happy the quirky best.
Friend or like the token asian and i was.
Like i'm i'm not cool with that i'm not.
Cool with that but but that's that's all.
That's a that's a whole nother i mean.
That's fine i mean that shows it's just.
Interesting cuz you you saw that issue.
Right and then you just said you know.
What i'm just gonna go do it and that's.
Something that i've always kind of.
Admired about you is when you set your.
Money you're kind of like hit that's why.
You guys fight a lot you guys are very.
Similar when you really set your mind.
Something you just do it put us in this.
You're like him with but with work ethic.
No honestly i'll let paco speak okay.
I'll correct and paco is people who is.
Naturally he's like like we talked about.
This before like in sports and stuff.
He's naturally gifted.
Yeah like wow you were on the e team i.
Was already a team and i was out.
Practicing what i do like scrawny agent.
Down there dude yeah i was crying he was.
Huge.
He had the arms but what i was saying is.
That i mean that's what you've always.
Been like when you want to go into.
Acting you went full-on into acting i.
Did i loved it and you know we did like.
I said we could do a whole park.
About like you know just like the craft.
Of youtube and the craft of paco being.
Podcast host and entertaining himself.
Like there's a there was a there was a.
Process to it that i i i really enjoyed.
Huh and i mean like it would be cool to.
Like talk about that on another podcast.
Cuz then you could come back and then.
You know bring the view yeah i mean.
You're you're welcome back yeah sure.
You will be like honestly no it'll help.
I mean whenever we have guests it's.
Interesting and people want people have.
Been asking for you you know that's.
Great no i mean obviously you're welcome.
And after this time after this podcast.
Maybe you can try out this youtube thing.
You know i mean you kind of cool got it.
Still it's being and i told you earlier.
I think you should do a podcast i mean.
You have like a radio voice and you're.
Really good at interviewing people i.
Mean you're naturally a host so like i.
Mean you could essentially be yeah be.
Fun what me and poc would do but in one.
I'll just take paco's job you could do.
That i don't need that ik my own i mean.
I i mean he's good but he doesn't you.
Know keep up on friends and he's not as.
Funny as i am his haircut is wack we're.
Not coming after your lame-ass job right.
But this is a dope podcast i'm just.
Talking about specifically you're wrong.
Laughter.
Actually that is something that uh ryan.
Was talking about was like the.
Challenges above you because you're so.
Charismatic and on camera you're just.
Like a really likable and relatable.
Person and i think that's something that.
A lot of people enjoyed and so to get.
Out of that shell when you went into.
Acting everything did that prove to be.
Something that seems to be a huge.
Obstacle because you were so used to.
Just you know being you on camera that.
If someone saw you in a different light.
Or in a different role they're like.
That's kind of like being typecast yeah.
That's not that i nodi i feel you.
That's a good question paco you did your.
Research like that's awesome i always do.
My research that's why you ain't taking.
My job that's true that's sure no so i.
Think.
With with that with acting right like.
The format is a little bit longer so if.
You like play all your cards you know.
People are gonna like lose interest.
After a while so you kind of have to.
Like internalize a lot of those like you.
Know the charisma or you know people.
Don't want like charismatic characters.
On screen like you they do like in the.
Right moments but like not all the time.
Whereas youtube you have to be turned on.
All the time and it's yeah it's the.
Thing that i was talking about was with.
I was like with ryan earlier i was like.
You know i think maybe kevin just came.
At a point where maybe it was a little.
Too early because now they are hiring.
People who are just like charismatic in.
Just themselves like kevin hart or ken.
Jeong or the rock you know yeah this is.
These people who are truly themselves.
Where if you you know try to do your.
Right with you right if you came at the.
Right time it might have been just like.
You know so like ken jeong kevin hart i.
Would put them in the comedian category.
Yeah i mean you're funny too you know.
Sometimes i know he knows dude you have.
To tell him yeah we're talking about.
Like putting them in categories of the.
Actor yeah union but and the rock is i.
Would say he's an actor and he's been.
Doing like dramatic and they're all.
Really super high level talent eeeh 1%.
Like you're talking about but just the.
Category you know like yeah like a.
Communion needs to all as well always.
Just like more so bring a certain energy.
Right so i mean speaking on that is.
There any just cuz i'm sure people gonna.
Ask what do you what are your plans like.
What do you want to do next.
Wow man okay so people are gonna ask.
Yeah sure yeah.
No i came on this cuz we were gonna you.
Know get deep and talk about anything.
That the fans want to hear and you guys.
Want to hear so the question being like.
What do i want to do next.
Um i i've enjoyed i i would say i've.
Enjoyed having a more private private.
Life definitely last you know half.
Decade it's been it's been really tough.
Really challenging.
So if i if i tried to like maintain.
Youtube and like do a career at the same.
Time i think i think i wouldn't have i.
Wouldn't be here right now you know i.
Would probably just like given up and.
There were times where i like felt like.
Giving up and and so just to answer your.
Question in a broad way like i'm just.
Kind of cultivating myself and then i.
Feel like at some point there will be a.
Period where i'm like i would love to.
Reconnect with with the people that i.
Collaborated with that we're part of.
This community of creators and also with.
With audience subscribers viewers that.
Supported me and grew up with me like.
That's the ultimate goal right but i.
Want to be at a good place before i i do.
That right i make that connection with.
Them so is that like that sounds like a.
Comeback yeah.
I'm not calling it a comeback i'm just.
Saying i'm trying to work on myself.
Yeah but eventually i mean you'd like to.
Reach back out to that audience right.
Well i'm not gonna sit here and be like.
Eventually i'm just gonna like like just.
Chill at home like i don't care about.
Them no like i eventually would love to.
Be in that position right but you know i.
Do like setup maybe i set a pretty high.
Bar like i you know cuz i i see you know.
This we can i can change the topic but.
You you see a lot of youtubers that that.
They represent something like being an.
Influencer and i like i just read the.
New yorker article with the makeup you.
Guys know i mean you're the trending.
Curator of the yeah yeah yeah so like.
That's a that's like a case study for.
Like you have celebrity you have status.
You have millions and millions and.
Millions of influence and followers but.
Like are you saying the right things are.
You being the right person and i feel.
Like there are there are really good.
Role models out there that i can like.
Support and channel my counter my energy.
For and.
Until i can like look at myself and be.
Like okay i can i can be that role model.
To on that on that very big public level.
Maybe not anything as close as like the.
Heyday you know back in what 2010 to.
2012 but like even i had a small level.
Like yeah what i would love to do that.
Night.
I do do that you know i'm coming on here.
To talk to you and yeah my family feels.
Like i've been present you know but it's.
Just maybe the the audience on that saw.
Me on youtube there's like there's.
Definitely like an absence there and.
It's it sounds it so it's almost like a.
Relationship type of thing where it's.
This what it sounds like to me at least.
Where you're like you know you're not.
Ready to come back to youtube just yet.
You know you're trying to find yourself.
Be securing yourself and everything and.
When everything i right yeah right you.
Know it's definitely relationship just.
Like our relationship yeah our you know.
We see each other once every three years.
Yeah and was just but you know i'm.
Dipping this is like me dipping my toes.
In and like i said i'm doing this.
Because i respect ryan and and i'm also.
Like friends with paco i don't know.
About france i don't know say friends.
But no i just i came on here you know i.
Couldn't turn down an invitation to be.
On the show and i actually was like.
Watching the show from back home in.
Houston and was like man be pretty funny.
To reconnect with ryan and just talk.
About mba which is what i requested paco.
Request that i feel more might like.
Rocky's shirt yes why isn't this the.
Conversation because you guys lost okay.
Well you still we got a problem.
Um just just to get a little i know you.
Didn't want to get back into it a little.
Bit but wait you're gonna you're not.
Gonna let me i mean we got a lot of that.
But go ahead when you're a true fan you.
Never lose its a growing period yeah you.
Don't lose weight you are on the team.
What's that boy.
Very touchy subject for him this just.
Happened yeah but this i hey don't make.
Me what am i doing right i don't even.
Know what i'm doing but don't make don't.
Open pandora's box breath what there's.
Nothing you your shirt says clutch city.
But it's automatic that y'all gonna lose.
Oh word yeah what's up i come with the.
Bars too boy oh we're gonna talking.
About that you guys actually made music.
Together and some really i know you know.
It's all plan fire you has been really.
Like successful songs and i kind of want.
To know before we go into the shishi.
Break how was the collaboration process.
On that i mean i think it though it.
Stemmed from the joke of being like hey.
Can we get away with doing something.
Like make a love song almost about.
Something while being douchey mm-hmm the.
Joke was being douchey yeah essentially.
But then us getting away with it giving.
A a reason to do it being that were nice.
Guys because we don't i mean we wanted.
To play the nice guys we didn't want to.
Be actual douches so it was a way for us.
To do those jokes without having to i.
Guess be real douches because it's not.
Funny if you're actually being a douche.
Right yeah it's yeah it was like a so it.
Was ryan myself and also chester yeah.
And he wanted to do a song like you use.
It he's a musician so he was like like.
Pitching us song ideas all the time i.
Feel like and it was great his.
Creativity was very motivating and and.
Then he kind of had this hook he was.
Like mm and he would just sing it and.
Then and then like when it finally.
Clicked for him for him i give a lot of.
Yeah i do give credit to chester for.
Coming up with that kind of hook and.
Then and then because we did shed it.
Tear like it was a lot of circumstances.
That went into it and ryan has a.
Specific humor where he likes to like be.
Hardcore and like but then like there's.
Some heart to it so it was a it was a.
Good combination and and shout out to.
Wong foo cuz like they they started like.
The asian being nice guys thing and we.
Was just like a lot of things coming.
Into play and and yeah i wish we were.
Able to like incorporate more of the.
Community in that but we ended up going.
And shooting the video like the same we.
Pounded it right i mean we'd happen.
Really fast we thought it was a.
Your video but we didn't think it was.
Gonna be like no yeah zero zero budget i.
Mean but back then though like everyone.
Yeah and then if you got like even a.
Decent amount of you see because this we.
Knew i was gonna get some views because.
It was bigger bigger production for us.
At the time of youtube nobody was really.
Making like that kind of content we knew.
That if we put that out and get more.
Views back then if you got that kind of.
Views and likes and favorites you would.
Be on the front page so they just.
Exponentially just boosts everything so.

Even a real degree and a half online uh.
And like i had done so many courses like.
I would take you know riding courses.
I've done i've hopped major so many.
Times and then it was just more product.
Of like what's what's like what's the.
Most convenient for me.
And it was again psychology yeah it was.
I'm not saying psychology is like.
Convenient it's a very complex and high.
Level like science but for me at the.
Time i like wasn't always at at home and.
I didn't wasn't able to travel to campus.
Like well every week so i just didn't.
Online degree pam yeah but only those.
Last few years most of my degree was in.

So i got into a lot of trouble uh you.
Know you know i also got it actually i.
Didn't even make it to you h you didn't.
Make the ua more like everyone in hawaii.
That's like their fallback like i want.
To laugh but i'd feel no we're gonna.
We're gonna offend all the people who.
Didn't i know i don't know what it.
Really means to very common in hawaii.
You know 2.8 gpa did you just get in.
Yeah okay i didn't get that do you still.
Have dreams like about like high school.

In school like i'm like.
I've dreams where i'm retaking middle.
School and those are like are you a kid.
Dreams i'm no that's nightmare mortal.
Yeah it's more like an asian nightmare.
Yeah okay but it's like because what i.
Feel like i could probably start like a.
An a group on this yeah i i think well.
We're your parents those i mean i've met.
Your parents but were they scary.
Typically like strict like asian parents.
You know they you know regardless of.
Them personally yeah it was just like.
It's a cultural thing it was you i don't.
You want it to be know me yeah strictly.
Were you a good student no oh.
How'd you get into uc david that's a.
Pretty guys youtube when i don't like my.
Extracurricular stuff like soccer you to.
Right right right.
Got it yeah my grades were i don't think.
I was top fifty percent but i went to a.
Very competitive high school i.
Shouldn'ta liek that oh yeah i didn't i.
Didn't my grades weren't good.
You shouldn't have leaked what i wasn't.
Even like in the top fifty percent of my.
High school that's fly mints i i mean.
And then look where you are.
Em i guess so still got your degree.
Right you went on this crazy adventure.
Of eat that is youtube now licking ya.
Know you're in movies you did a bunch of.
Stuff and you didn't its you didn't need.
To get straight a's.
Right you could still do things right.
And my parents still love me there you.
Go yeah it's all your kids out there are.
Your kids out there doing really poorly.
In school we're not encouraging you to.
Do that yeah but it's it's possible to.
Make it better do well for parents yep.
For yourself but actually you know.
Talking about your relationship with.
Your parents and going into it the same.
I like it when ya going naco talks a lot.
Sounds like a dude no go ahead.
But going so the question that comes.
From twitter and it's a from tony stank.
South tony what's the best slash funny.
Memory you have while filming a video.
With your dad because you said your.
Relationship with them wasn't so.
Stereotypically asian.
You know so i didn't say that well were.
They wearing i said i was talking about.
The strictness of you know it was a.
Stereotypically agent oh really.
Okay yeah so then i guess if you could.
Explain you know because the.
Relationship with your dad was very.
Public and it's very like you know smile.
That part was not so i guess what was.
Your favorite memory and what was that.
Like - i'm trying to think of a specific.
Memory but like i mean one comes to mind.
When when we did like what we hate about.
Each other and mike there's this one.
Joke i like could not stop laughing and.
He was just talking about my like bad.
Eating habits and like where i would.
Like not close my mouth i would eat.
Loudly and the way he said it was like.
He used the example of like you know.
When you eat noodles he's like my dad.
But you can watch the video he's like.
Like a noodle when you eat the noodle.
And i was like at first i didn't know.
What he was saying but what and then he.
Just kept saying second noodles and i.
Was like yeah that one that one comes to.
Mind yeah i mean he's like like you said.
It seemed like he was having fun and he.
Did it i mean i don't i don't really.
Know i mean it seemed like he enjoyed.
That attention right yeah yeah so i.
Didn't have to like pay him back her.
Mm-hmm you know give him residual checks.
I'm sure he wasn't asking for him yeah.
But yeah and that's that was that's.
Unique to him and he just like i'm.
Grateful for that we got this might be a.
Little personal too but you have talked.
About it publicly and everything but uh.
Eddie ass please tell us like what.
Happened with the accident and like what.
Do you been up to recently you know and.
I know we can go like a full podcast.
About uh-huh because i'm sure yeah that.
In itself yeah cause a lot of.
Realization in your life right but if.
You could give us a spark note version.
You know the thing that i used a lot in.
High school okay yeah so you know.
Shout-out to eddie for you know asking.
The question and for paco to segue it by.
Saying it's just a little personal you.
Know he's just like oh it's not that.
Person yeah you know it's it isn't.
It's nice to sparknotes through trauma.
It is yeah it's it's uh you know just.
Get so like quick glance over it you.
Know we don't have to go into it you.
Know i mean if you're a relative out.
There well you talked about it yeah you.
Want me i got you i'm you're gonna base.
You're gonna make him knock oh it was.
Bad it was it hurt a lot and i was sad.
And my parents were sad and i had a like.
Walk a long way back to get back to.
Health i mean you i mean this is where.
Where did this happen um it happened in.
Norcal just so people okay yeah by.
Myself i was by myself - and you said.
You still i mean it still hurts you.
Today uh well yeah yeah i i still have.
Residual pain from but talking you want.
To go and talk about pain no no no i.
Mean you can we're asking about your.
Story so you know we want to hear more.
From you i know i know what i need.
Empathy if we're going to talk about it.
Yeah i mean i mean yeah i mean it it.
Sounds like something that you know that.
You have to deal with a lot consistently.
And it's always something that but i.
Guess because of the pain it's allowed.
You to grow you know obstacles in your.
Life for the things that either cause.
You to change and adapt for the better.
Or you either like let this toxicity.
Like just fester in you and you just.
Like are matted like situations around.
You and you know but it seems like you.
Took it in like kind of like made it.
Into a positive.
I would say i'm living with living with.
It yeah sure.
I wouldn't like put this like.
Inspirational ideal twist on it and say.
It's like been a positive experience for.
Me but it's definitely been it's.
Definitely been an obstacle and and part.
Of overcoming those things is is gonna.
Make you stronger but but i'm not too.
Focused on on the end result of like.
Coming out of this like stronger and.
Like ready to like teach the world how.
To deal with you know this kind of thing.
That would be like.
That would be like down the line but.
Right now i'm just just trying to like.
Live a normal life what do you have to.
Say on the matter ryan well i mean i.
Don't think we should keep you don't.
Want us talk about we don't have to keep.
On that so yeah i just think it would.
Take up longer than ian that's why i.
Said so we can wear em back you're more.
Than welcome to come back yeah multiple.
Top possible you have me back on the.
Show we got to see how the views are.
Come back ever you might come back as.
The moderator i don't know yeah yeah so.
Like right now you know like there's a.
Little bit like you know dissing between.
Us it's like friendly competition or.
Whatever but when you were near the you.
Know the top of youtube and stuff and.
You and ryan were kind of like like best.
Friends side-by-side did you view him as.
Competition though in a way cuz i was.
Like you're a very competitive person i.
Am but lydon i love humble people and.
Ryan's one of those and so like i think.
Before i met him like there was a lot of.
Youtube like like oh they're both asian.
And they're comedians and and they.
Should like who's better but like once i.
Met ryan that like that did like.
Evaporate it was like literally gone a.
Lot of a lot of people kind of like our.
Fans would make us have some kind of.
Beef big day would have beef and i.
Compared you know i mean you've seen it.
You've seen the comments people just.
Naturally because there wasn't many.
Asian i mean there was agents but me.
Kevin i where we were at the top at the.
Time so naturally people are gonna.
Compare us because we're both asians and.
We do comedy or yeah you're doing vlogs.
I started doing vlogs more skits you did.
Some see what you did skits to you did.
Like that vlog skit vlog and ryan are.
Also very different yeah and my.
Completely there was such a big need for.
Like asian american like there was.
Enough pie i would say for like the both.
Of us like it wasn't like we're both.
Fighting for the same audience it was.
Like he's bringing something to unique.
I'm bringing something unique and let's.
Let's just like write write write or die.
Together was the first time we met at.
Youtube live to write that was the first.
Time we did that's where i.
So we talked to david because that's.
Where i met david - you know what i tell.
Them that like the the shirt thing when.
I was like awaiting you like we were.
Gonna go to the event and i like made it.
Like a backhanded comment about what.
Your way i know you remember it i.
Remember vaguely but i was like you.
Remember it more i do oh you're gonna.
Wear that okay yeah you tell it and then.
I'll give my side on yeah i was just.
Like you know i saw ryan as you know.
Like influenced a big big deal.
And i was like you know you're about to.
See like all these people in person for.
The first time like i've been to youtube.
Events but yeah that was my first event.
It's overwhelming and there's like you.
Take hundreds of pictures or you're.
Meeting lots of people you know you're.
Meeting not just like viewers.
Subscribers you're also meeting other.
Youtubers that you follow and like or.
Maybe look up to and not to but you were.
You were just so humble that you you're.
Like i'm just gonna wear a grey.
Undershirt and like some jeans and let's.
Just go and i was like dude you're.
Behind you like are you gonna wear you.
Know i do remember like coming like.
We're about to go okay and then i.
Remember coasting oh you're gonna wear.
That i think the timing was like almost.
The most self-conscious things i always.
Say about kev is he'll say things and.
Even if it's like whether it's funny or.
If people get offended a lot of times.
It's not to be mean it's literally just.
Blunt just honesty hmm.
I think a lot of times you say things.
Even though or it's overly sarcastically.
What do you guys would have been doing.
All day and then you'll be like oh no i.
Meant all of it but people will really.
Believe that but they were i realize.
That you're joking but like i didn't i.
Had just met him that day other than.
What i've seen online so i took that.
Personally.
Oh yeah and i remembered everything you.
Told me that yeah numerous times this is.
Like 2010 was that 2010 yeah so like.
What.
Other stories do you guys have like fun.
Time between each other it's a lot what.
Can you share cuz i'm sure there's a lot.
Of like r-rated stories man you guys.
Were in ytf together sure which was a.
First probably the first big like super.
Group on youtube hopefully at the time.
It was unique so i mean like what what.
Stories do you guys have that like just.
Some idea or just anything but just.
Between youtube that you guys can.
Remember that it's always just like what.
Are you looking for like i mean are you.
Looking for what are you willing to.
Share basically lived in the same.
Building where not all of the youtubers.
Live in la and north hollywood there's.
So many of them that moved in there by.
The way into that building specifically.
Youtubers yeah wow we were the first.
Though i know we were nobody else is.
Around.
Anyway we basically lived in the same.
Building so we'd i mean there's so many.
We saw each other almost every day for.
Like years so i mean it's hard to say.
One specific thing i was your favorite.
Consistent thing then about each other.
Are it consistent yeah i mean we we.
Lived next to the dance community too so.
Like you know obviously my roommate was.
Victor his was d-trix we were next to em.
Else to do like a crew from houston that.
I'm fond of so real crew was like ryan.
Post post they were all like we were in.
The same circle and then you had the.
Acoustic singers like junior who was.
Here the two weeks ago.
Just so many talented people so like the.
Consistent thing was like just being.
Awed by like and our place was like the.
Kind of hangout spot for just all these.
People to like just kick back jam.
Sessions were crazy like we would just.
Like turn on the camera and do like the.
Spam freestyle or and then like behind.
The camera like people are like just.
Like haven't liked playing beer pong or.
Something you know so like we were just.
Having fun but it was also like kind of.
Productive because like us being.
Together like was like good for our.
Community and just like sharing talent.
And so i was like that was consistently.
Pretty cool yeah yeah i will say like we.
I mean i got spoiled by that like we.
Were surrounded by like the.
Dancers in the world the top some of the.
Top singers you know and they would just.
Be like we had a regular party you just.
Be like making up songs on the spot.
While people dance to it yeah yes the.
Most amazing like choreo you see me lox.
And freestyle rapping and it's just like.
All this talent and we would happen all.
The time that i just didn't appreciate.
It as much because i'd like the least.
Yeah we had no talent on my gym tour we.
Had to make skits because we were like.
We just announce people's names like.
Here's another good person at what they.
Do and we're just like we would slow jam.
Sessions and we just be filling up space.
Yeah like anyone could have been us yeah.
But we got to witness it and we did not.
Film that a lot of times the best cover.
You weren't even filled yeah and we did.
Not carry our responsibilities well.
That's the only thing that's all.
Contributed was like sharing it yeah.
Dang people are gonna be upset and my.
Other we just you know i remember that.
Though is because when jr. came back and.
He sang just for a little bit like we.
Didn't ask jam or anything yeah i was.
Just like damn this is so good i'm like.
A show yeah and i forgot how like i took.
This for granted because they used to be.
There all the time and sing guys to it.
Yeah we had just yeah i kind of wish it.
Was like you know i want to go back to.
Those one of those parties we're like.
There's just so much talent where and.
Then there's me and kev just just.
Watching just truth just like nodding.
Our heads and yeah oh man.
