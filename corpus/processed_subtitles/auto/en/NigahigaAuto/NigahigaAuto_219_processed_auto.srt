Do you ryan can you make a horror skit.
About how it feels to be a pokemon.
Music.
Please mom i don't know it's gonna be.
Dark soon but i'm not even gonna go that.
Far and i'll be back before dinner i.
Promise what are the rules oh um no.
Fighting stay away from the city and be.
Back before it's dark see i got it and.
And if you see a human come on there's.
Never been in and if you see a human if.
I see a human i will run away be back.
Before dinner thanks mom.
Growing up in the viridian was normal we.
Were in the deepest part of the forest.
So there weren't many other pokemon.
Around.
Was quiet peaceful nothing really ever.
Happened at least that's what i thought.
Music.
Back mom wise wise are the things in the.
Front.
Music.
Look at you.
Ridicule what which is good before.
Battle i don't want to battle you though.
Greater choice.
Music.
There we go all better.
Let me go and get your trainer for you.
This is your first time the hell's going.
On i was just all beat up and now i'm.
That human that just left she healed it.
Why would a human kind of help us help.
Us.
You got a lot to learn to make us fight.
Into the brink of death just before one.
Of us dies to heal us there we go all.
Better.
I just do it all over again and there we.
Go all better.
Why don't you guys just not fight you.
Don't have to obey them and i think.
We've tried that it break you i don't.
Know what it's like to be stuck in that.
Ball for weeks months even years nothing.
To do nothing to see no one to talk to.
Start to forget yourself.
She's moments the very war where you're.
From how much rather fight every day for.
The rest of my life with these two meter.
Three minutes and freedom i just stuffed.
An eyeball myself.
Music.
Applause.
No mom.
Never come out of that fall again.
Music.
Sorry.
