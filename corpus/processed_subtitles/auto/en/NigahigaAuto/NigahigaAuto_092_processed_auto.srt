Hey guys so just to let you guys know.
This video is gonna be a little weird.
And it's gonna feel kind of rushed and.
Yeah i don't have a lot of time to.
Explain it so i'm just gonna get.
Straight to the point sean is moving.
Away normally this would be the part.
Where i would cut to like some kind of.
Sad skit or do some kind of joke or.
Something like that but like i said we.
Have no time he's moving away in two.
Days so just for some backstory sounds.
Not fighting with anybody in the group.
Or anything he's literally just moving.
To california to be with his girlfriend.
And i don't know if you guys know her.
Now but sean has an engineering degree.
And that's one of his other passions and.
He's gonna pursue that but we never.
Really knew when exactly we didn't have.
Like an exact day so we thought that.
When you told us you know when he's.
Gonna be moving out we could have enough.
Time to plan this surprise you know.
Party or surprise performance for him.
Kinda gives us two days to come you know.
Come up with an idea and then pull it.
All off he's gonna be tough i'm like i.
Was saying it's feeling kind of rushed.
Right now so i can't spend much more.
Time here the guys actually just came.
Over so we can start planning that.
Secretly planning this video because.
Sean still packing so we it kind of.
Gives us two days to come up with an.
Idea and then pull it all off.
It's gonna be tough sean this video is.
For you we got to just get to it right.
Now we're doing the planning stages for.
Sean's we don't know what it is gonna be.
Just to reiterate i just got back from.
Hawaii right now as i was getting back.
Just texted me and said he's actually.
Gonna be moving this week versus at the.
End of the month we did northern.
California i won't say where it.
Specifically sacramento so we can get.
Started let's figure out just make a.
List of what sean likes first thing that.
Comes to mind when i say shop fujiyoshi.
He likes hawaiian food a lot of spam.
Okay okay famous bowls do the cookies.
And cream.
I know get back to the house sean he.
Likes putting stuff together yes sean he.
Does like she's always on a rubik's cube.
Yeah i love puzzles yeah no fishy you.
Like swinging it's a necklace thing that.
You got oh wait what one thing that you.
Really like some crocs.
When as sean ever wore prop that's why.
But hey you know i mean i don't i don't.
Know just do that on your own time enemy.
You know the best just like hawaiian.
Music yeah yeah reggae you should make.
Him a ho lion song okay papi how you.
Decided to it okay like a music yeah.
Might be about this yeah that's possible.
We might be able to edit it together.
Dude we got two days it's easier than.
Doing a live all dressed up like we're.
Gonna be hawaiian singers and rappers i.
Think he would laugh i think we should i.
Think everybody should know it's like a.
It's a message to sean i mean it must be.
Hard we'll just be like background.
Sounds and like ad-libs and stuff yeah.
How we're gonna get him here without him.
Knowing you has to know something's up.
Leaving that day do you have like a.
Super old screen i have a bunch well i.
Should make a really bad one so he's.
Like what the hell and then he's like.
Really good does not want to film it.
Nobody comes it'll be more you know take.
Me can get really bad so really happy.
Okay so we'll just send them this is.
Horrible script um to be there on friday.
Will arrive a few hours early to set up.
The whole surprise me video and all that.
Stuff yeah okay operation on three three.
I'm looking for beats on like royalty.
Free music.
We're not musicians i just typed in.
Hawaiian and reggae sean's favorite.
Music.
I honestly it could we could use any of.
These but i think it should be something.
More happy my type in hawaiian anything.
Comes up there's like so stereotypical.
Like listening i can't sing to this or.
It is like on spongebob.
Not like hawaiian cops that brought us.
What you gonna do bro whoa whoa doing.
Maria na na hai in the studio right now.
And as you can see.
Check out my studio you got the little.
Laptop setup right here got the mic and.
Then mount proof right here some sound.
Proofing machine the sound proofing.
Honestly don't know how to use most of.
This stuff i just know how to plug it in.
And then hit record so usually i make.
All the songs with myself i do all the.
Voices and they kind of just like lips.
But since this is a special thing for.
Sean we're going to do is have.
Everybody's voice on it i'll probably do.
Most of it but like i definitely want to.
Have everyone in it.
So hope you guys are ready i am singing.
Can't make me derek you're a senior bro.
I can tell i'm ready.
Stop this one here goes up to avoid.
Moving away movies in me meets this.
Culture of operation it is it really is.
Or is it appreciation culture.
Appreciation over from hawaii yeah i.
Grew up minnows this is part of what the.
Culture i grew up please culture.
Appreciation not appropriation.
Appreciation we appreciate cuz we grew.
Up with the culture through several to.
Do nine one six.
We got an itch.
First i was perfect.
Shawn shawn hado wait shawn every fire.

Feeling about one for sure.
Music.
Music.
Oh i see and flip the switch.
Over the past two old days the rest of.
Us here at our hpc have been observing.
Studies compiling data on a favorite.
Things from hobbies to show to smooth.
All in order to create the ultimate most.
Epic most amazing celebration we've gone.
Through countless gift ideas from all.
New fishing equipment to a trip to.
Disneyland to just straight-up giving.
You a suitcase full of cash but nothing.
Seemed right until it finally hit us why.
Don't we give shawn the best gift he's.
Never asked for a poorly made snob.
Ian rush lions laughs reggae music video.
Record by all of his best friends and.
Also paco and so we did welcome charge.
The beginning of the ultimate.
Probably somewhat disappointed.
Celebration.
Music.
Applause.
Music.
Now we barely posted let me do this i.
Just might some kinda game but the rest.
Of us in irish pc would like to see ya.
We love you we gonna miss you and if.
You're feeling lonely you can take this.
Is to show our appreciation.
Applause.
Music.
And give your final salutations what's.
Up shawn so i am pretty bummed that.
You're moving but i'm excited to see.
What's in store for your future one.
Thing that i'm gonna miss about you is.
Your ability to solve puzzles and.
Problems and stuff like that and i.
Remember specifically you actually.
Enjoyed the process of solving the.
Puzzle so what we decided to gift for.
You was a rubik's cube buzz but we know.
It's really easy for you to solve this.
This is not an ordinary rubik's cube.
Plus all we did was we colored when the.
Yellow squares white so you'll.
Technically never be able to complete it.
You'll just have the fun of trying to.
Solve it for the rest of your life and.
If you get bored of this one we got you.
This super easy one that you'll be able.
To figure it out now good luck have fun.
Shawn what's up bro you're leaving it's.
Gonna be different not having you around.
You're like basically my right-hand man.
When it comes to filming editing you.
Know getting stuff done with with ryan.
And the videos and all that so it's.
Gonna be a little different me and you.
Were always kind of like you know.
Sidekicks i guess we would even dress.
The same sometimes don't shoot you know.
We would like resting clothes they like.
The same church for some reason we're.
Always wearing hats for some reason.
Backwards hats especially so we decided.
To get you a hat actually make you a hat.
Because it's not just ordinary hat as.
You can see it's backwards but it's.
Always backwards yeah buddy.
Anyway i'm gonna miss you bro i'm gonna.
Miss having my right-hand man.
But you know i'm sure we'll keep in.
Touch and we have one out there bro i'm.
Gonna miss you peace hey shine i just.
Wanted to say thank you so much for.
Being literally the first friend i made.
And an excellent roommate for when i.
First moved to las vegas anyway as you.
Know and as you all know you're the.
Sweatiest member of rhpc but i've never.
Seen this much before and i know you and.
Ryan talk about this all the time on how.
Wish there was some sort of shirt that.
Me armpits were lighter than everything.
Else so that when you get sweaty it'll.
All be the same color.
Well now you have one so enjoy we're.
Gonna miss you good luck in all you do.
And keep in touch shawn i can't believe.
You're leaving dude it's so crazy we.
Have so many memories together you've.
Always looked out for me and i.
Appreciated that you know we're excited.
For you and we're trying to think as a.
Group you know what does someone need.
When they're moving furniture i know you.
Love building stuff i know you have an.
Engineering background so since you're.
One of my close friends i decided to.
Break all of it for you that way you.
Could have fun putting it back together.
There might be some missing screws maybe.
Some splinters and pointed edges sound.
Like a ghetto ikea but i think you'll.
Have fun and that's what matters.
Enjoy hey what a song it's your favorite.
Arts pc member paco i know you're.
Leaving and i'm happy for you man cuz.
Not only do you get to start a new life.
But i get more active parts so yeah no.
Seriously i'm very happy that you know.
You're able to make this move i mean it.
Takes a lot to be able to move past a.
Comfortable stage and move on to another.
Part of your life and i notice you know.
You always have that necklace on and you.
Also have like one word on there so i.
Thought you know in this new state to.
Your life you need a new necklace and.
Bigger is better so i got you a big.
Necklace yeah.
You can probably put the word like.
Hard-working or popco you know cuz i'm.
Someone who inspires you a lot and i.
Know that you always want to remember me.
Because i'm the best and also the guys.
Thought this would be kind of wack but i.
Know you're gonna like it good.
Yeah i got you some crocs too ready.
Definitely engineer appropriate attire.
You're gonna look fresh building.
Building all right peace dude like this.
Dire urge to start this video by saying.
Hey guys but that's not the point.
What up john i'm just gonna start this.
Off by saying that i feel very weird.
Obviously i feel sad that you're leaving.
But the same time i'm really happy for.
You but it is weird i'm not gonna lie.
It's weird that you're not here right.
Now like at this shoot that we're.
Shooting today you know how it is when.
We're missing someone from shoots it.
Feels weird but i guess we'll just have.
To get used to that but anyway i'm just.
Gonna start us off by saying that i am.
Very thankful for everything that you've.
Done you know not just for rhpc not just.
Like filming and stuff like that.
Obviously i'm thankful for that stuff.
But just as for me personally as a.
Friend i'm extremely thankful we've.
Known each other since i was five and.
You were four i think it's rare to have.
Friends that last this long i think in.
Our late 20s both of us damn world but.
It's pretty rare that we're still able.
To maintain this friendship and for me.
Personally growing up especially like.
Her on middle school high school time.
Your friendship meant so much to we're.
Making youtube videos we're making those.
Lip sync videos we were dressing up as.
Girls and you know publicly putting this.
Stuff out there youtube back then was.
Not what it is now this is like oh 506.
When you know we were the weird kids.
People didn't look at they looked at us.
Weird this wasn't a normal thing and you.
Were right there with me and i really.
Appreciate that i had somebody by my.
Side obviously we had tim and our other.
Friends as well but we were a small.
Tight-knit group and you're always there.
By my side sharing the weird burden but.
Anyway i'm not trying to make this all.
Overly dramatic or emotion or anything.
So i'm just gonna go on to your final.
Gift as you can see it's right here are.
The things i feel like we've always had.
In common is that we've always watched.
Anime final gift is themed anime without.
Further ado a beautiful piece of artwork.
That i person.
The art on the bring a little closer see.
Whole csu as you can see your finally if.
Is something i worked really hard on i.
Don't know if you're right.
You recognize this or not but this is.
When we did the anime shoot so that's.
Why i was talking about anime and how.
You know personally i think this.
Something you can hang up on your wall.
And when you move any fine you already.
Know this is not the real thing.
Oh reveal what the real one right now.
Take a look anyway all jokes aside again.
I just want to say i appreciate.
Everything you've done for not just me.
But the entire crew and oh there is one.
Last thing i know i said i didn't want.
To make this you know all cheesy and.
Dramatic but there is one thing that.
I've always been wanting to ask you and.
You know it's it's kind of awkward for.
Me to ask you like this i just know i'm.
Just gonna add let's just go back to the.
Song i didn't wanna make this song.
Emotional there's one last thing i need.
To know before you.
The one night was live with the right.
Side.
I just need to know can you see.
Applause.
This is to show our shuttle speciation.
When tirpitz and give your final.
Salutations like we said before.
