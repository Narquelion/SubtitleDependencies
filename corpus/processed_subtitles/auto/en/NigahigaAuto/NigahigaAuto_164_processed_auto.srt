So like the part like is say for sure.
That there's no scrip there's no paper.
Script on terrace house never had a.
Girlfriend never kissed a girl and has.
Never changed since the show you know it.
Yeah the more people who wants me to die.
I want to live more and the more people.
Who cost me that then i'm gonna you know.
Lose more weight alright clap claps.
Alright welcome back to another episode.
Of off the bill podcast.
Okay that's good today we got david in.
The moderator seat paco right here next.
To me i'm ryan and we have a very.
Special guest mr. eden kai in the house.
I recognize him from uh teddy's house it.
The hawaii edition was it name of that.
One aloha state aloha state let's see i.
Should know that we should know that why.
I didn't watch it huh no but i did a.
Little bit of research so i knew that.
Anyway we met a few months ago and i.
Said i was a big fan it was a mind.
Blowing for me because i was a huge fan.
Of you yeah i i am so just for people.
Who don't know terrace house is a it's a.
Japanese reality show it's on netflix.
And fuji tv in japan three guys and.
Three girls living together and romance.
Or their life focus on their lifestyle.
Just think of like a wholesome jersey.
Shore or real world kind of thing honey.
I don't know how to explain because i.
Never liked those show like reality.
Shows but that terrace house was the.
First one i could actually watch really.
Oh and i think it's because it doesn't.
Look like there's there's minor things i.
Don't know how what's so a big lievable.
It is that could be a cools you into.
Like the normalities of it's not.
Dramatic like people fighting every day.
Every episode and well i don't know.
Maybe there's some truth behind those.
Lights or something goes yeah i think.
That's interesting to hear because i.
Hear a lot of people from foreigners a.
Lot that they want to learn japanese or.
Like they're learning the japanese.
Culture and that's like the most people.
Who watch us like the show right well i.
Mean watching it just like the there's.
Things i didn't even happen ease i don't.
Even know because that's not my culture.
No i'm americanized so just like.
Watching that show and seeing like the.
Little things that get on peoples nerves.
I guess or like the way that it's just.
Such a different maybe that's what's.
Appealing to me it was japanese culture.
And how's everyone's so polite and the.
Moment there's like you stray away from.
That a little bit it's.
Offensive i mean depends what you do and.
Stuff but i think yeah well let's talk a.
Little bit about who you are.
Cuz you knows for some people who.
Haven't even seen this show they they.
Don't even know who you are in the first.
Place uh you know where are you from.
You know you're a lot younger than we.
Are twenty-one yeah.
Born in 1998 some time flowing right and.
You were on the show at the age of what.
Eighteen eighty i was a senior in high.
School and where were you born and.
Raised i was born and raised in tokyo.
Japan.
A place called hot tea oh gee and i.
Never went to international school just.
A regular public school until seventh.
Grade and after that my entire family.
Moved to hawaii about six and a half.
Years ago so went to a local high school.
Graduated so you can speak this well in.
Six and a half years well i'm still.
Learning my dad is from actually my dad.
Is japanese-american so he's uh who was.
Born and raised in portland oregon okay.
So i understood what he was talking.
About but i so my mom's from a normal.
Way too but spoke like japanese to both.
Of them it's still like pretty.
Impressive that you're being able to.
Pick it up cuz i originally just hearing.
You talk i thought you were american.
Raised that's a compliment in hawaii.
There's like no accent whatsoever.
Yeah well yeah you have the laid-back.
Kind of personality of a hawaii person.
As well well i mean i'm from oi you know.
What i mean though cuz he's even better.
Than people from is great like in.
American people probably think you speak.
Better english than the two of us wow.
Maybe you just learn the right way well.
That means you're really smart that.
Means you did well in school probably i.
Always follow my passions your position.
We can talk about that so you actually.
Even on the show you were well you do a.
Lot of things but you were primarily.
What oh cool a player i played the.
Ukulele acoustic guitar and i'm a.
Singer-songwriter currently and.
Now you're doing shows and stuff yes.
Going back and forth would you say most.
Your fans are like no you from terrorist.
Isles.
Yes i think so but oh no what is your.
Fan base like because you know ever.
Since netflix has acquired the rights to.
Terrorist house i'm sure that has got to.
New like international fans yes it was.
Pretty mind-blowing for me too because i.
Did not know first that it's gonna be on.
Netflix that i was like only for.
Japanese tv but when i first noticed.
That oh like an english comment i.
Posed and after it had like a lot of.
Stuff happen and it's i was happy you.
Know and bless and ever get to never.
Thought of like experiencing stuff like.
This and i'd say a lot of people are.
From japan or in japan your fan base fan.
Base yes but at the same time some.
People are from us canada europe.
Philippines thailand brazil i'm just.
Blessed.
You're a worldwide sensation and.
Multi-talented i was kind of shocked how.
Many people like not just in japan and.
On like how many people watched harris.
House like it's a japanese reality show.
It doesn't make sense that all of us.
Would love it so much but it's it's huge.
Like i mean if you know you know a lot.
Of people don't watch it but the people.
That do it's like they're super into it.
I agree actually you know um a lot of.
Agent people lie doesn't matter if it if.
The person is japanese or chinese or.
Korean like a lot of agent people.
Basically watches the show which is.
Pretty mind-blowing to me too or if.
Anyone's dating mazin they watch it.
Watch it like so like me my wife or my.
Husband i'm wondering like is there just.
I'm sure there are i'm bothered song.
Really racist but is there like i wonder.
If there's people who are just like what.
In a white group that watches terror.
Cells i'm fine i feel like is that rare.
Like in the midwest because it's not.
Netflix so anyone can watch it right.
It's not where i think but like most of.
Them aren't like asian people both like.
I do.
Receive some comments to like you know.
That's non-asian so what's the puted and.
Do they just like because i know there's.
Some people just like japanese culture.
Exactly like whoever likes japanese.
Culture or you know who's interested.
Yeah to see what is it like in japan or.
I'd like to live with japanese people.
Right.
I will say this is to the audience.
Anyone listening right now or watching.
It sounds i'm just gonna be completely.
Honest it sounds like the most boring.
Show in the world but then that's what i.
Thought initially watching one episode i.
Was like oh that was alright i guess.
I'll watch another one oh i got addicted.
I actually felt the same when i just.
Heard about the name before ello has.
State only knew about the name i never.
Watched it and i could totally relate to.
You cuz like that's what i thought yeah.
The description right three guys three.
Girls living in a house yeah and and.
Nothing really like it's hard to say.
Nothing happens because when you.
Compared to american reality shows right.
Like jersey shore yeah it's more a world.
That's so dramatic people are fighting.
Punching each other and stuffing and.
Then and then you watch this show and.
Everybody's so polite and nice to each.
Other then the cameras just set on a.
Tripod is like beautifully shot it's not.
Like extreme zoom ins and shaky cameras.
To make everything look more hectic you.
Know it's very calm and relaxing and.
It's like watch some people eating.
Dinner yeah it's a like you ma but it's.
Really a isn't it more so about like.
Your the the viewer is thinking about.
Like what they're thinking like what are.
They thinking when they're silently.
Eating together what's going through.
Their mind right all the little nuances.
Of like human interaction i think that's.
What's really right funny and.
Interesting and also having the.
Commentators right the what do you guys.
Call them i say well we say like studio.
Members or snowmen bah and stuff i love.
Them yeah they're super entertaining.
That's what makes the show yeah no.
Offense but i mean like it oh for sure.
No they they're the consistent people.
That there's basically for those that.
Don't know you guys have a reality show.
But in between the show there's.
Commentators commenting on every little.
Thing people say like people they don't.
Like they're celebrities right yes they.
Are like remember the guy with the.
Glasses yeah machaon yeah he's a.
Professor.
Comedian and i was so happy when i was.
You know roasted i am well i mean he.
Told me that oh you skip bet like you.
Know drink all the bathtub water like.
Girls like japanese paco and i could be.
Like i do not or did i pass the word so.
When the show is coming out it's.
Sometimes it's not finished why you guys.
Are still recording right like no you.
See yourselves like as a show a film.
That's the cringe your awkward part of.
The show cuz we're gonna see ourselves.
When that's released right inside the.
House which we did so you know remember.
The scene that oh like are you.
Interested on the you know anyone or a.
Boiler who's your like favorite like.
From aloha state mm-hmm and you know.
Blah blah blah blah and that scene is.
Out and right we watched it and it was.
Pre awkward well i was wondering cuz.
There's i mean again spoiler alert.
There's there's moments where you got.
Like in earlier episodes you guys all i.
Feel like in every season they always.
Talk about oh who are you interested in.
You know and you're just like a private.
Conversation with the boys private.
Conversation with the girls but it you.
Know you're being filmed so like you.
Know that other person's gonna see it.
Right mmm don't i mean doesn't that.
Affect i mean i don't i don't know maybe.
I feel like i would be affected by.
Knowing that that person's gonna see it.
Well i wasn't for me personally i didn't.
Know like that it'll be on that that.
Early first of all so i wasn't so i.
Don't know like maybe others like they.
Knew about it so you were you being like.
Completely just like oh these are my.
Honest feelings cuz you were very honest.
By the time that they said yeah i'm out.
Here on his human being no but uh yeah i.
Wasn't i wasn't thinking about that at.
All you're just being authentically you.
I think so like the part is that you.
Know i could say for sure that i.
Is nervous a lot for the first couple.
Weeks cuz you know like living with.
Strangers and i was like the youngest.
You know uh the other cast eric and even.
They're like you know 27 26 and that.
Time and they were like 10 years older.
Than me you know.
So i was you know a little pressure like.
And i was kind of you know scared they.
Couldn't like me or not and stuff but.
You know once i kind of got used to it.
And got close with them and stuff.
Everything is fine okay yeah did you um.
I guess i don't know if you can talk.
About this or not but like did was there.
Anything that you'd i know you can't.
Answer this i don't why i'm asking but.
Is there any way that you really didn't.
Get along with their it's got to be.
Annoying living with two other dudes in.
The same room that's like it's not it's.
Not just housemates it's roommates right.
And then three girls like right down the.
Hall i don't know if it's down the hall.
But like in the same house you know it's.
A beautiful house but there's got to be.
Some things that get that got you a lil.
Annoyed i don't know if you can say what.
You can say i could say that right now i.
Love them all today for sure that the.
Whole purpose is you know we all have.
Different personalities everyone's.
Different and for a low estate what's.
Interesting is that there's people.
That's japanese japanese from japan but.
There's also local people so there's.
Gonna be you know some culture.
Differences how they think different.
Yeah for sure.
So yeah you know like might be tough.
Sometimes but they kind of you know get.
That long i mean you've seen like eric p.
And l mean that scene to you yeah so.
Stuff like that and could you explain.
What happens between this cuz i haven't.
Seen it so well justin we were talking.
About this earlier just like japanese.
Culture in general is so different for.
Like what's acceptable and what isn't.
You don't sometimes you don't even know.
I think in that snare without spoiling.
Anything you don't even know that you're.
Being offensive to someone when you are.
In a different culture because you.
Wouldn't it's not considered offensive.
In their culture in your own culture or.
Like even you're originally from japan.
But if you you know used to the.
Environment that you're know been around.
Then you might say something offensive.
Right.
Because you just forget about it yeah.
Well so you're indirectly saying that.
There are some people in there in the.
House that may not have you may not have.
Liked what are you trying to fish out of.
Him right now i don't think you said.
Anything about that's though would you.
Say you're friends with everybody.
Mm-hmm and you're close to everybody.
Well um i'd say no cuz everyone lives in.
A different place some people live in.
Japan so who lives in hawaii somebody.
Lives in la or mainly new york yeah.
So you know we're going our separate.
Ways but i'm totally cool with everyone.
And i think everyone's cool like you.
Know we're on the most recent season as.
Well they brought you back yes.
Tokyo 2019 2020 so you're in right now.
Only part 1 of the new season is out.
There's another part are you can you say.
If you're in that as well.
We'll see yeah i have a question about.
It's like because you know not everybody.
Has the opportunity to be on a reality.
Tv show right and you know i think a lot.
Of people do wonder about the camera.
Situation like how many cameras were.
There it was it just like a bunch of.
Like webcams that were set everywhere or.
I'm nervous or just like good quality.
There yeah or just like dslr cameras or.
Whatever is i think he said he can't you.
Can't say right behind the scenes stuff.
Okay well avenger it depends i will say.
There's a reason why we're wondering.
Because no one's allowed to say anything.
On that show i feel like i tried to.
Google it before it's just because it.
Shot so differently that is i think.
That's another attraction where people.
Are like how are they filming it with.
And getting these like raw real motions.
From people that's not over-the-top yeah.
I mean i have a friend who was actually.
A director for a reality tv show mm-hmm.
And he told because i asked him some.
Questions about how reality tv shot and.
Some of the things that he mentioned.
Where it was that like he will like.
Everything's real but there would be.
Certain scenarios that he would kind of.
Create like yep.
All can say hey this person kind of said.
This thing about you and you know like i.
I like i don't know normal in reality.
Shows that right uh no we got we did not.
Have that oh really.
Um yeah so like the park is say for sure.
That there's no script there's no paper.
To script.
Oh no it's harris house hmm so but i.
Mean you know like how you guys like.
There's a camera rolling someone walks.
Into a room and then all of a sudden.
Every like the cameras or the camera.
Rolling all that time that's a lot of.
Wasted footage you know i'm saying like.
Someone has to turn that camera on i.
Mean i know you can't answer that but.
I'm just saying like that's what i.
Wondered about it's like how obviously.
I'll weed the same yes yeah yeah i'm.
Like he walked into the room there's no.
Way like the cameraman is on a tripod.
There's no way the cameras just there is.
Just waiting for him right yeah i was.
Like and if they're not filming the.
Whole time is that's high quality.
Footage there's no way they have that.
Much space hold all that footage anyway.
We'll get all away from the behind the.
Scenes stuff no you can't talk about it.
Anyway but i mean in general i will say.
I mean you kind of in a way blew up from.
The show right i think everybody like.
Different levels right like lauren.
Really blew up from the show do you like.
She's like on a tv show now right i know.
It's crazy yeah and then you're doing.
Shows all over the place which you.
Weren't necessarily doing before like.
Touring and yeah i mean i'm just blessed.
And unlucky well you're skilled i mean.
There's a reason why people were.
Impressed by you and it's also very like.
On the show they were talking about it.
Like how'd your you have such a it's.
 very um.
Introverted i guess i don't know if.
You're an introvert i'm just assuming.
Anyway you seem very like yeah sly it.
But then when you play them clearly when.
You play instruments you're like crazy.
Well i mean i'm happy to hear that uh.
You know oh another thing um i never.
Really wore pajamas before but for sure.
House and stuff i wanted to be polite.
Said that's why i decided to bring my.
Pajamas but never thought of like.
Receiving lots of like positive.
Feedbacks same for like the first.
Episode right yeah and same for my.
Personalities you know i was in.
Affecting to recede like no feedbacks.
Like that you know oh he he's acting.
Completely different way he plays a.
Guitar oh cool oh right i was like.
Really like never thought of that.
Yeah so it's it's i think the part.
That's interesting for me or like other.
Cast members is that you're able to look.
At yourself on the screen mmm from like.
The third point of view right because.
You're not used to just seeing your.
Everyday life because she'll definitely.
Learn a lot from it you know where.
There's some things in in the show that.
You wish they didn't cut out for they or.
That they are you wish that you that.
They did it did or they did yeah.
Probably you wish they did but i'm sure.
They picked the best moments yeah like.
They can't show everything yeah it's not.
It's only sure for sure what in 45.
Minutes.
In episode something like that oh well.
They cut it out you probably can't say i.
Want it to be cut or like i wanted.
Things you wish shouldn't have made it.
Well back then definitely the scene when.
I eat catfish alone good scene though.
Yeah nowadays it's super hilarious like.
It's it's funny i love can you describe.
The scene for those who haven't seen it.
Well i went out or you know that with a.
The cast one of the cast members and.
Went to go watch some some fantastic.
Piece you know the movie and after.
Everyone yeah yes it's i was it was a.
Great movie anyways comment about the.
Movie but a movie with someone from the.
Show yeah from the show.
Yeah and after the movie you know it was.
Supposed to be a surprise and i.
Reservation like at the place a.
Restaurant a restaurant yep.
And i asked her if you want to go eat.
Dinner and i khloe got declined well.
What was her excuse.
She had grandparents dinner or something.
Like that i really hope she doesn't.
Watch this it's all in fact we're gonna.
Clip it in sent and tweeted to her.
That's even better that's better.
She said that she had to go to dinner.
With her grandparents which is a lot it.
Was something like reasonable sure it.
Was just i mean but then you got to see.
The behind the scene just which is what.
I was talking about earlier of what like.
She was saying well i think she really.
Didn't have to do i don't know if that's.
True or not well i mean you know i think.
Family is important what i could say.
Family is important you know like you.
Don't know what's gonna happen like.
Anytime so i'm such a nice guy i think.
It's a nice so you're too nice so she.
Had to go have dinner with her.
Grandparents and then and then you went.
To dinner that you made a reservation.
For two with you went alone and then you.
Ordered a catfish yes that was my first.
Catfish and you know i did not want when.
I you know cancel the whole reservation.
And why not i mean i feel like most.
People would have done that but that's.
Why his he was so interesting on the.
Show you know cuz she actually went well.
It was like you know pretty close for.
The movie theaters so yeah why not you.
Know some stuff and then basically the.
What was sad about it is he there's a.
Shot and he's just eating alone after.
Being rejected essentially and it was.
Just very sick it was like a very like.
Heartbreaking but man because.
Everybody's ruined for him you know but.
Let me ask you this did you enjoy the.
Catfish i tasted a bunch of emotions but.
Actually fun story on this trip in la i.
Have any catfish for like three years.
After that and recently a few days ago.
Actually ate catfish wow that's an and.
Then what happened it tasted a lot.
Better and now he's back ladies he's.
Back on the market the bats kiichi he's.
Gone i wouldn't know i think they moved.
It or something right or it's gone like.
That.
Have more anything from it but uh i.
Think one thing that i read online um.
That they're talking about like you're a.
Virgin or something when you went on the.
Show yes what i mean the hope i think.
That what you said initially coming on.
With some or i mean it's.
I never gone in a relationship yeah yes.
So like complete then just like yeah.
Never had a girlfriend never kissed a.
Girl and has never changed since the.
Show you know it.
Netflix popularity baby one i mean i'm.
Sure you've already said everything.
Without saying anything but i'm.
Definitely still bad on it you know so i.
Want to ask you riley where i ryan any.
Tips for for me like for dating advice.
You're asking me yeah i mean i don't.
Know if i'm the best person like i'm not.
Known for picking up girls well i would.
Say right one i would say naturally your.
Your genuine kindness seems to be a gift.
And i think if you're just more.
Confident with that you seem a lot more.
Confident already from the show at least.
Just talking to i mean you're talking to.
Us like it's nothing and they con the.
Show it seemed like you were struggling.
To just talk to people initially but it.
Seemed to improve over time and i.
Haven't seen the new season with you in.
It.
I was gonna wait on to the next part.
Comes out and watch it all at once i can.
Binge it awesome but yeah i mean just.
Talking to you now is kind of shocked.
Before like because i hadn't met you.
Except for that one time and we barely.
Got to talk and i didn't know what to.
Expect to be honest i mean that's.
Another thing about those reality shows.
Like you get an idea of a person mm-hmm.
But they're not always exactly like that.
Or maybe you've changed a lot i don't.
Know well i could totally say you know.
I've been there a lot over 30 years but.
You know things about a show reality.
Show is that what they show it's it is a.
Part of me but it's not everything of me.
You know and there's always gonna be.
Like some fun parts with me and.
Hopefully i could you know show more of.
That.
My life journey is there anyone that you.
Feel like not necessarily acts but like.
They know they're on camera so they're.
Acting differently from when the cameras.
Are off.
You can't talk but yeah.
What is your break no spice we do but.
But i think before we go to the sushi.
Break you did bring your guitar here.
Yeah in case brought a guitar we should.
Add that as our she she we've never had.
A live performance here.
Really we've never no never i think you.
May be the first here let's see how we.
Can even record this properly yeah yeah.
We would love to see music from you.
That'd be amazing before she well let us.
Yeah take us away into our she she break.
No be serious eating guy this is a you.
Know a clip of my new song that i work.
With a cat mcdowell and because of me.
Some cola they're awesome and uh it's.
The song top is called outside inside.
And you know the time i get treated as.
Japanese japanese in hawaii and a.
Foreigner as a foreigner in japan i had.
That a lot and i used to think about it.
A lot but like the most importantly just.
Be you kind of song like the course goes.
Like song canon soft kitty and intial.
Goes like.
Music.
Thanks i was really nervous and we're.
Back welcome back thanks for that that.
Song it was awesome i know thanks then.
Very quick actually it's such an honor.
When did you learn to play when uh for.
Guitar i was i think it was 14 and i.
Started playing the collide from high.
School.
Oh well that's kind of recent that's not.
A easy thing to do where you found of.
Jake shimabukuro uh i know i said it.
Like that actually you know did not know.
That and uh uh and look like after all.
Like i've searched it up after i started.
Playing though clothing and stuff and oh.
My you know such a cool playstyle and.
Stuff and i got to meet him one time and.
Yeah he was super kind yeah yeah he's.
Awesome.
Yeah i never met him but everybody in.
Hawaii knew about him just because he.
Was the guy who could play they were.
Clearly a little too fast because crazy.
Man slow down dude like i'm getting.
Nervous like yeah yeah it was pretty.
Crazy yeah so what else is going on i.
Mean you're here here in la right now.
Doing what shows here or mainly creating.
The ep right now and uh so this is your.
Third it's actually my first ep and then.
What are these two things so those two.
Are albums my instrumental albums i made.
It a while ago actually from high school.
Mm-hmm and i had couple albums from.
Japan but you know it's unreal label.
Yeah and uh yeah things kind of changed.
Well you look very different i mean you.
Obviously a lot younger but you look.
Very different.
You said you were thank you you would i.
Mean he lost a lot of weight i did i.
Lost about 35 pounds after.
To tokyo serious thank you well i mean.
That's a that's a lot like what what.
Sparked it like why all of a sudden well.
You know i wanted to you know be a best.
Version of myself and i think you know.
Once i get the attention from the.
Viewers as how the show goes.
You know i love the fans and stuff too.
But you know i also try not like listen.
To some people who gives out like.
Suggestions trying to be like little but.
Really i feel like we're in a time right.
Now where people want the opposite.
They're all about body positivity and.
Silence yeah but i mean i i'm assuming.
With all that positivity there's always.
Gonna be comments that are the opposite.
Right naturally trolling and yes and.
That really affected you mm-hmm the.
Thing about this show is dad you know.
People are gonna criticize see you.
You know people everyone is different.
You know everyone has a different.
Opinion so if i do this on the screen.
People think how yourself like done dad.
Right and said you know there's like.
Everything going on everyone has an.
Opinion about you yes yes man i can't.
See a lot of negative opinions about you.
Though again what what can i like what.
Like what i mean this is one thing where.
It's just like you're too conservative.
You know you're too kind.
Where you put other people before.
Yourself which is sometimes like are you.
Really living your best life at that.
Point are you mate are you really making.
The right decisions for yourself or are.
You living for the gratification of.
Others mm-hmm so a lot of times when you.
Hold yourself back like that people can.
Be frustrated because people uh you know.
They want which is weird because they're.
Living through you in a way where.
They're like oh you should have been.
Yourself this is where you should have.
Broke free they would have done yeah.
Exactly.
So that's why i like those are the type.
Of criticisms or you know like when i.
Guess the awkward situations and like.
Being rejected like oh you got rejected.
Because of this i would've did that so i.
Mean yeah it's like those types of.
Things but it's not saying it's not.
Saying he's a bad person no i know i'm.
Saying.
Kind of surprised that that was the.
Thing they attacked you like i'm sure.
That there is other reasons they.
Attacked you but i mean to say like hey.
Lose weight or like you're too fat or.
Whatever you weren't i mean like you on.
The show you weren't that like you.
Weren't big i don't think you were.
Overweight yeah not it i don't think so.
Understand if you compare two americans.
Japanese in japan it might be over.
Without where the comments came like.
That those comments came from mostly.
Japanese fans or is it from americans as.
Well mostly from japanese people.
Immediately you know like don't get me.
Wrong like everyone has you know people.
Yeah stuff but not a spoiler but before.
Part two is out i've received like a.
Tons of more comments like that then.
When i was appearing on although his.
State oh you the current season the.
Current season sees a lot of hate i did.
Mostly regarding your weight or.
Something else.
Everything everything like you know just.
Just straight-up die and stuff you know.
Like i mean after all all the stuff that.
You know has happened for the past three.
Years and especially like this year i.
Think i have a like thicker skin i have.
A stronger mental and well not always.
But i'm trying like thinking you know.
Positively you know yeah the more people.
Who wants me to die i want to live more.
And the more people who cost me fat then.
I wanna you know lose more weight as.
Much as possible i mean not at the point.
That i'm gonna like not you know have.
Like if he's just order something but uh.
Right you know just trying to be healthy.
Trying to be myself and i mean i don't.
Feel anything about it but like you know.
For at that time it was pretty tough for.
Me that i couldn't share my emotions to.
My fans are the crowd you know i just.
Get it act like nothing is going on but.
You know that happens for everyone else.
I think it does but i mean i think you.
Have to a certain degree you have an.
Image of like real real innocence and i.
Think i mean you even just sing and now.
Like you feel like you can't really.
Express yourself completely i feel like.
I feel like you can like i think i think.
I mean.
I do like like in front of like my.
Friends or like you know but non-public.
Like face to face is that do you think.
Is that a japanese culture thing culture.
It's it's a long it's a long story like.
Well what uh what would happen if you.
Were to because you know in america.
Right like if you look on on youtube and.
A lot of these youtubers expressing.
Themselves expressing their i love it.
Like their depression and the things.
Their struggles and that they're going.
Through if you were to do that to a.
Japanese audience.
How will they generally react to.
Something like that don't wouldn't that.
Make this like feel a boo right is it.
Taboo or do they feel more like they.
Could relate to you and like oh i go.
Through that too and i want to support.
You it really depends if it's like a fan.
Fan then you know gonna be like very.
Okay or you know like i want to relate.
To you but like if it's like just other.
Everyone else then it'll be like like.
Don't give me that negative five i don't.
Want to i don't want to see that kind of.
Stuff right so it's it's not a it's.
Depends it depends on situations and.
Stuff that's what i know japan is like i.
Mean traditionally like you don't like.
Even just like naturally me growing up.
Like we don't share you don't share your.
Feelings really you know with when.
You're growing at least for me it's not.
Like we didn't have a loving home or.
Environment but if you're like i don't.
Know you i don't i never told my dad hey.
I love you like you know like it's not.
Like in tv shows you don't really say.
That at least in my household and all my.
Friends growing up around that time.
Maybe it's different now i think it's an.
Asian thing yeah it is an asian thing.
Yeah i think so maybe maybe not but i.
Feel like you're younger too but for me.
Um well the reason it started music is.
You know to make people smile not only.
Kind of sounds cheesy but i want to you.
Know bring that positive vibes and what.
I loved about you youtube watching your.
Videos too.
Is it makes me smile like you know it.
Makes me positive overall and that's.
What i want to do and i'm happy that.
It's my job and you know effort like.
This personal stuff instead i think it's.
Really no need to share that with people.
But i only want to share something.
That's happy with people right so you'd.
Like to bottle up that stuff in a way.
Which people say not to do but i mean i.
Think everybody does it to a certain.
Degree and i also think right now it's.
Almost.
People at least in the us have been.
Going in the opposite direction and.
Creating more drama because that's what.
Has become like the thing right to share.
Your depression itself yeah which is i.
Mean i like i said i think the stigma.
Should go away and i'm glad that people.
Are sharing this stuff but i think.
There's also people who are how do you.
Say like that it's being over there.
Taking advantage of the situation.
Yeah because it's almost like becoming.
Like i don't want to see a trend because.
That sounds disrespectful but it's kind.
Of becoming that and i feel like if you.
Can't get away with that it's a very it.
Just it just sees i see the difference.
In the cultures essentially if you were.
To do that i could see why your japanese.
Fans would be like no what are you.
Whining about like keep it to yourself.
Kind of thing i don't know if that's.
True i'm just like i'm top of my head.
Maybe i mean sooner or later a might.
Just be like oh whatever just start.
Showing my emotions and stuff but i mean.
For most of times i'm i'm pretty happy.
All right i try to be positive kind of.
Guy so right you take the negative and.
You use it too yeah like now i feel.
Better if i received those comments.
Because i get more you know motivation.
You know talking about the catfish you.
Know like reject me more or exactly more.
Like one more rejection you know a lot.
More haters so so that i could go like.
You know i could motivate myself and be.
A better person.
Well we all hate you here so oh thanks.
This list 10 things we hate about eden.
And oh wow i know it's surprising only.
10 there's way more to be hundred over.
Hundred we get some of this like the.
Twitter questions i mean there's stuff i.
Know we can't you can't talk about but.
It's kind of interesting oh oh sorry i.
Said one of the questions which i like.
To because uh i'm curious you kind of.
Dodged this a little bit but what is.
Your love life look like now mmm are you.
Single ready to mingle.
Are you in a relationship are you.
Talking are you dodging this question.
Well uh.
Go let's party when it's out oh wow you.
Just told us you're in it then wow.
No i didn't say he's in it yeah okay.
Well i mean well let me ask you this.
Have you ever written a song about.
Someone that you loved or interest in or.
A song for a girl at any point in your.
Life yes are all of your songs about.
Girls in your life yes no what can what.
Gives you the most inspiration though is.
It like when you get heartbroken or do.
You draw inspiration from other things.
So when i create a song you know it.
Could be affection or not affection i.
Love to like create a little small short.
Story inside my brain i wanted the song.
To start but like i wanted the song to.
End at the same time and it could you.
Know come from like a personal.
Experience to you but like it also be.
Like some kind of location or like view.
There's a really beautiful place called.
China walls and for my lot of my.
Instrumental songs i used to go there.
After high school as i went to high.
School in hawaii kai my friends and you.
Know just chilled there and the sunsets.
Are super beautiful and that really.
Inspired me a lot of creating original.
Songs so it depends but hmm yeah what.
Kind of girls do you like like if you if.
You're not in a relationship if you were.
To get into one know what kind of girls.
Do you find yourself more attracted to i.
I love well does it matter like a friend.
Or anything you know a person who's.
Really passionate about something you.
Know it really doesn't matter what it is.
But as long as like they're really.
Passionate about it you know they're.
Chasing that dream or or just a little.
Thing you know um personalities and what.
About personalities like girls were a.
Little more quiet.
A little more.
Able to have a conversation outgoing.
Loud energy low energy outgoing for sure.
I think cuz you know just love to.
Communicate with people nowadays and.
Nowadays not nowadays are for me i feel.
Like that's a skill you i mean i know.
You can mentioned it on the show but is.
That a skill that you learned from being.
On the show because it seemed like over.
The course of those episodes that you.
Were on it improved for you you seem to.
Really shy and then you slowly started.
Opening up but i feel definitely better.
Than before for sure but not at the.
Point that i'm satisfied so i'm still.
There's more to go for me did you have a.
Lot of sorry you're saying go ahead like.
When you were in junior high high school.
Elementary did you have a lot of friends.
Or did you hang out with like a few.
People just a few and you're still.
Friends sometimes i mean that's that's a.
Weird answer we this is what i want to.
Say we hang out sometimes yeah cuz.
You're busy when i whenever i'm in back.
Back in japan yeah but you know it's the.
Thing about schools dad everyone kind of.
Goes like you know there are like.
Separate ways you know everyone lives in.
A different location and i'm more.
Excited to meet new people for me who.
Has like a similar interest or a similar.
Passion well so you're in um sorry.
You're in japan how long again fortune.
Until 14 14 so what do you like better.
Like as you like where do you like.
Living better uh us why is that.
I feel more being myself in a u.s.
Meaning you can you just feel more.
Yourself because i i feel more open.
About anything in the us and you don't.
Feel that in japan no it's because of.
The culture the society yeah i just say.
This society the person if the person is.
Okay culture yeah.
Really you know something like if the.
Person is like older you have to be.
Super polite or you know if it's like.
Your boss you gotta be super flyed can't.
Be late or you know if you something.
Slade.
You gotta apologize and so all these.
Like you know tim who are like me.
Manners and stuff and i'm not saying.
It's bad at all it's really it's great.
To be polite and stuff but sometimes you.
Know when you when you kind of get used.
To the you know aloha vibe right the.
Local vibe and whenever you're back in.
Japan all the sudden you know it.
Sometimes it kind of its kind of too.
Much yeah no i mean i hundred percent.
Agree because i mean i only went there.
For like i was there like a month ago.
And i was only there for like a couple.
Weeks and i've been there maybe three or.
Four times not very long and every time.
I go it's always like everyone is so.
Polite and so nice to you that like you.
I feel brewed by just existing and not.
Following you know i mean like i'm own.
America and like i.
Oh shoot was i supposed to like just.
Little things like i read on oh i didn't.
Read i saw a video too saying like how.
To take trains and stuff like that i.
Didn't know how to how to do any of that.
And then like just just rules and like i.
Didn't know but i was doing it i was.
Like talking on the train and i noticed.
Oh wait no one talks on the train i.
Don't i didn't know that was an.
Etiquette thing i don't know if that's.
True or not but i mean no one talks to.
Each other on the train and i was just.
Big old english american accent just.
Talking to people no i mean it's just.
Like little things like that i didn't.
Even think about but like it's mmm.
Everyone is so polite and i feel like.
It's not real i don't know if that's.
True enough but i feel like nobody can.
Be sown hatt likes put on a smile and.
Treat you so nicely all the time like.
There has to be some pointed then though.
It's just like i don't like you they're.
Really suppressing like their real.
Emotions yeah and i feel like i don't i.
Can't tell because everyone's so nice.
But when you're there long enough you're.
Like this is kind of suspicious nice.
They are so that's why they're mostly.
Honest on internet but i could i just.
Say you know there.
Really committed which is not a bad.
Thing at all but japanese people like.
Their early commit only what they're.
Doing yeah but you know sometimes when.
It kind of goes too much then you know.
They're they get super exhausted or they.
You know you know the situation like.
They work too much yeah they all of a.
Sudden like blackout and stuff and.
That's what's been going on a lot and.
Yeah so i think that's you know it's all.
About the balance there's pros and cons.
That reasons yes yes exactly like.
Japanese people they have like like you.
Said one of the best work ethics but to.
The point where sometimes like there is.
Exhaustion and i think japan has one of.
The highest suicide rates to which is it.
An unfortunate fact but it does come.
With the fact of being unable to express.
Emotionally where you're at right.
Because you're you know or and the.
Expression only a correlation yeah and.
The expectation because yet to get into.
High school you have to test right yes.
And even then there are certain high.
Schools that are very good and if you.
Don't make into that it's looked down.
It's not like a ct that he could just.
Take it over and over again if you just.
Mess you get away for another year and.
There's such a huge pressure it's.
Heavily looked down on i i don't know.
How much i could say about it but like.
You know people now does its kind.
Different before people used to lay.
Judge from like what kind of school you.
Went like no matter like friendship or.
Work right you know he didn't get into a.
Good school the people who did look down.
On the other people right so for me like.
I never attended college you know.
Graduate high school yeah in gosh.
Trained into music so that what did they.
See you as scum nowadays no but maybe.
Before like maybe you know traditional.
People might think oh you never didn't.
College like you know he's that smart.
And stuff right but i'm happy that.
There's you know a lot of people in.
Japan who accepts me like of who i am.
Right well you said a lot of your like.
Half your fans are from japan mm-hmm.
Anything is a little bit of the graces.
Of the media and being on terrace house.
Yeah you get that exemption because it's.
Like oh you didn't go to college but it.
Paid off because you.
You were able to do these things well we.
Had that that was my the whole subject.
Of like you know what i when i was.
Thinking the entire time of aloha state.
Whether or not i want to attend the.
College or not i was planning to go.
Attend a music college mm-hmm and after.
You know like we seen some life tips and.
Advice i talked about to everyone and.
Decided on the show you said mm-hmm and.
I decided not to but you know like.
There's no regret of whatever i have.
Done and mostly i really want to take to.
Take care or lie when i really want to.
Care about people who also cares about.
Me mm-hmm and i think that's the most.
Important thing okay sounds great.
Sorry kind of got too deep no no that's.
Great.
So i noticed i watched some of your.
Performances and whatnot on on youtube.
Oh thanks notice that your dad is a very.
Important part of your career i you know.
I met you before this podcast you know.
With your with your dad and we had a.
Great conversation and it seems like.
He's very integrated into your your life.
Yes he has you know in fact the music.
Stuff actually came from like my parents.
To like my music interest that kind of.
Makes sense see musicians or my dad used.
To be a performer he used to work for.
Nhk for 18 years he did it.
Radio casting right yeah like voiceovers.
And he used to be actor too.
Yeah you've done like a lot of stuff and.
You know my parents loved music they i.
Think i remember like you put you play.
Like some like classical classical music.
When i was like little but most likely i.
Was heavily influenced by a michael.
Jackson mm-hmm.
Because i was just blown away of like.
How music could be powerful like how.
Much it could influence the entire crowd.
Or like you know.
The whole entirely generation like you.
Know right so since then like i started.
Actually singing first before guitar i.
Knew clay but i was like stalking for.
Like 4 years when i was really into.
Playing the guitar so that's why during.
Terrace house and so i wrote that song.
Called monogatari one will be left or in.
The forward before i left.
Yeah okay so before that song i haven't.
Sang for like four years.
Mm-hmm but yeah so for my parents so.
Your your full-time musician slash actor.
Would you say yes acting used to be not.
Used to be acting as my another passion.
I'm passionate about i used to be a.
Child actor when i was around sex you're.
A child actor when you were in japan.
Yes oh what-what were you in anything.
That's a little bit good fine um like.
Just several commercials and maybe tv.
Dramas and so nice oh like a reoccurring.
Actor yes yes starro that so that's.
Basically where you got your start then.
Right well it was a while ago but after.
Since the terrace house i'm trying to.
Like you know i found out that's you.
Know it is my passion so i'm trying to.
Get back into it right and it's it's.
Definitely fun you know doesn't have to.
A professional film movie kind of style.
But it could be like you know a really.
Casual video and stuff i just um i i.
Want to like entertain people and you.
Know if there make them happy basically.
So yeah how did you feel after being.
Rejected by haruka haruka is how you say.
It then watching the fireworks by.
Yourself that sounds like a typical sads.
It's up to you and catfish moment i mean.
I i don't know what you can say but that.
Part is clearly already out i read the.
Question and it's motive because i asked.
I was like who is haruka i didn't watch.
Dude i already know now so i mean like.
What happened yeah.
What happened you can talk about the.
Stuff that's already been out right sure.
Just tell us the scenario we want to.
Know about you you know learn about your.
Torian situation but what is this well.
This is all you know has happened okay i.
Went to the house and there's this girl.
Like alone and she looked like have.
Pretty heavy heavily weighed depress and.
I asked her what happened and she liked.
One of the guy who also lives in a house.
But one of her roommates told him okay.
That she likes you without even asking.
Her yeah exactly.
Stuff and he rejected her aha man wow.
Then i'm getting confused but yeah okay.
No keep going i'm following.
So she was she looked pretty depressed.
And i just wanted her to feel better so.
I'll be back in japan next time on july.
If you have time do you want to hang out.

Said yes and well i haven't like really.
Watched those episodes at that time and.
Came back from straight from airport and.
Went on a dinner and you know start.

Person is like really nice and kind and.
After a few days or something later she.
Wanted to learn oh cool la so i saw her.
Oh cool all eh mm-hm.
And i told her that i'm interested in.
You like for like a third liked and you.
Want to like go as a date but she kind.
Of refused she told me that she only.
Sees me as a friend i'm sorry she said.
That and i was like okay and at that.
Point i wasn't sure so earlier on we.
Were talking about the nice guy stuff.
Mm-hmm.
Lovely would the video - nice guy back.
Then and uh anyways i was you know for.
That time i was kind of like starting to.
Hate myself for being a nice guy i'm a.
Typical nice guy oh you're so nice like.

Putting on like you know on a friend.
Zone all the time so i you know ended up.
Like talking about this to avian in.
Tokyo but she told me that you know like.
It's everyone likes your personality.
Whoever at liking appreciates your.
Personally really does appreciate and.
You know there's not much people out.
There is a place don't change that's way.
She's she told me and told me and i was.
Wondering cuz i asked her to you know go.

She was interested so but she wasn't.
Sure and well for me i wanted to go just.
To clarify stuff up like i was i really.
Like moved on actually that time and you.

Personality is very unique and i think.
It's very it's almost i mean i don't.
Want to say too nice you are very nice.
But i think it's a good thing and i.
Think like she said just just hold on to.
That and wait until that right person.
Comes along that's gonna accept you as.
Because i don't think you need to be a.
Bad guy the point of nice guys the song.
Wasn't about not being a nice guy finish.
