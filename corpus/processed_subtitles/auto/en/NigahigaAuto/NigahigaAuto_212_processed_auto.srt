I don't know i don't feel very cool.
Right now why don't why don't you feel.
Cool right now dude you know i mean for.
One we're sitting in this tiny little.
Room.
I wonder people when they watch this do.
You think they think this room is big.
Because we're not like in the same shot.
That's one thing yeah for sure when you.
Watch it cuz i i when i want i mean we.
Know what the room looks looks bigger.
Does it look bigger i think so it's like.
You know when you watch tv shows and.
Then you go watch it like i remember we.
Went to a bdc.
When they saw it on tv and you went and.
Watching a live audience you're like.
Yeah dude this room is so small like how.
Do they do it like it's true you know.
Even nba games yeah when you go to when.
You go there i mean the people are.
Obviously gigantic but if you go to.
Actual if you go to an actual nba game.
Using see if you go to an actual game.
It's the court looks so small in.
Comparison to what it looks like on tv.
And the stadium itself i mean the.
Stadium is big but the court looks so.
Small and the people are just gigantic.
There's got to be some kind of like a.
Like name for that right like there's.
Something something effect is that like.
The camera adds 15 pounds to you like.
That's everything that really does that.
That does happen though no higher.
Definite i don't know why but even like.
Even in person like i remember i went to.
Go watch a spurs game and i saw for the.
First time i saw um manu ginobili in.
Person doing all the clothes because.
We're sitting behind the spurs bench and.
He looked so tall and skinny mm-hmm i.
Was like dude he looks so unhealthy.
Right now but like on tv they look.
Normal he looks skinny on tv but like in.
Person they all look so much taller and.
Skinnier yeah makes you wonder who else.
What do we really look like in person.
Actually everybody says that we're a lot.
Shorter than they thought we would be.
Yeah i don't know that's sad.
It's hard to tell with like youtube also.
Because you don't really see usually.
Like you can't see our legs yeah i'm.
Gonna.
Sitting like this in the podcast like.
We've met people that we didn't know.
We're super tall last the case i was.
Actually kind of tall okay so all the.
Big though all the really big - he.
Doesn't look tall but he's actually.
Pretty tall rice come my school yeah.
Yeah like who were there right we're.
Just short they also we're normal like.
Normal height but we're all like 4 feet.
5 speaking of which chaos is coming into.
Town again and he went to a club i'm not.
Sure what with all of us wait is it just.
Him or the sidemen aside mint - he's the.
One who you know so i think they want to.
Do some kind of collab what but um we.
Should think of something - maybe we.
Should you know what he'd do is make it.
Like a suprise because he didn't tell me.
What they're gonna do either so we.
Should surprise him and like just i.
Don't know what should we should just.
All when he walked into the room would.
Just box him all of them oh yeah he.
Loves and we just like start mauling him.
Just mob him i think i still probably.
Knock us all out yeah he's so big we're.
Only 4 or 5 no but then the the twist is.
We all lose on purpose and then out of.
Your room comes logan ooh and then they.
Just had the fight right there no jake.
He's fighting jake no i think he said he.
Doesn't know really logan we're gonna.
Find out the true details and we're.
Gonna give you guys the exclusive.
We're gonna find out what's the real.
Story here i wonder if no iii think i.
Don't know i feel like evoke isn't logan.
Way bigger than jake i think he's like.
Considerably no i don't think that's.
Fair do you think that's fair logan.
Versus jake doesn't jake seem way.
Smaller than both of them he's no wise.
Because you cuz the effect oh yeah yeah.
Anyway yeah look that up but i know that.
Logan was a wrestler was jake a wrestler.
Too i'm pretty sure they both are in -.
Yeah some kind of like combat sport you.
Know wrestling or whatever i always had.
This idea when i would i wanted to do a.
Ryan tries i want to wrestle one of them.
I mean they're really good they're.
Really good wrestlers there way heavier.
I know but it's not like a serious it's.
Just.
Like just for mr. wrestle you know it's.
Like it'd be like fun i would watch the.
Hell out of that video yeah.
But ryan i would probably spray beat up.
Oh to be titled ryan tries wrestling.
Game paul look at the paul's the paul.
Brothers yeah but i think i would it.
Would be better to wrestle jake because.
He's smaller i think like more closer to.
Your weight do you know can you look up.
His weight cuz that's a big spoke with.
Wrestling is like a weight is a big it's.
Like dean yeah because if you wrestle so.
On even the next weight class it's it's.
A pretty big disadvantage right it is.
Yeah it's i mean the 10 pounds or.
Whatever weight difference is sometimes.
Even as little as like 5 remember you'd.
Be like there's like a 119 weight class.
And a 125 130 wow or 132 or something.
Like that but it's like that little.
Amount makes a big difference so for the.
Boxing match jake wall weighed in at 82.
Kilograms which is a hundred and eighty.
Pounds how do you know that the internet.
Saw how much is uh how much was ksi and.
Logan they would be more i think there.
Are over 200 i thought kilograms i mean.
I wouldn't be surprised there he'll must.
Kill so case i weighed in oh for his.
Earlier fight against joe weller was a.
182 pounds oh oh they're about the same.
Oh i don't know where i'm still got like.
A bunch of pound yeah i guess jake isn't.
That much smaller than logan there's no.
Guess i oh well i guess i can't wrestle.
Anyone then nevermind rice gum i'll.
Still do it.
No i used to he's too light look him up.
Let's look him up i think he's like 140.
Pounds how would you know though there's.
Not like i'd say he's probably more than.
That he's tall but he's skinny dude.
That's true but he's pretty muscular.
Like is he i think so like athletic i.
Never seen he's good at basketball i.
Know that what says he weighs about a.
Hundred and forty three pounds oh don't.
You dad that's not shocking friend and.
He says that's with the three supreme.
Chains that he's wearing what are you.
Where are you getting that this is just.
The internet.
Okay yeah all right well what kind of.
Topics we got today.
I don't know but well i'm gonna find.
Somebody to wrestle we're talking about.
A lot about a youtube drama and stuff.
That's going on it's a little bit yeah.
But there's actually two different.
Things that we can talk about which is.
The shane dawson incident which you guys.
Are already familiar kind of but not.
Quite and there's another one this romeo.
Lacoste i believe was that he is a.
Tattoo artist oh i did hear about yeah.
He's a tattoo artist he's done tattoos.
For like ariana grande dolin twins ninja.
A lot more people and it's come out.
Where there is allegations against him.
That he has been messaging girls gender.
Age underage girls and also we know that.
This is true though like i mean has he.
Come out and defended himself here he's.
Done an interview that's defended.
Himself but with so many people coming.
Out and saying things and it's not just.
Like screen shots there's like videos of.
It showing that he said certain we'll.
Say allegedly yeah that's why i said.
Alleged he saw that he dm these girls.
Like really sexual stuff and at the time.
Those girls are like 15 or something.
Like that 14 15 i just it's still it's.
So mind-boggling to me that people i.
Mean you still do that and have written.
Proof like don't people learn like even.
Like a head of files don't not saying.
Him specifically but how do people still.
Like wouldn't you know better might not.
Like that is how do you get caught right.
Like what this different one you don't.
Like if he didn't know right like he.
Didn't know what she was underage but he.
Said something acknowledging it like.
Something like hey do you want to wait.
Till you're 18.
Or are you more doing it now or.
Something like that so he acknowledges.
That they're underage mmm but how do you.
What goes through your head being like.
Hey this is a good idea i should write.
Something that's probably think it.
Doesn't go through the head like this is.
A good idea.
They're just that's easily thinking with.
You know something else.
It's penis i just have mental.
Laughter.
No i just want to push the bus you know.
You can sleep you say i'll go recorded.
That on the somme board we'd never used.
It but i guess there's a reason he is.
Thinking with that and you know it's i.
Mean it's a it's got to be like a mental.
Illness right yeah i mean i'm not trying.
To make excuses i'm just saying it it's.
There has to be something wrong to be.
Out or maybe just the person's like a.
Bad person hmm you know part of me.
Probably sort of like if you were.
Talking to a girl and even if there were.
I mean obviously talking to underage.
Girls is like not okay but you don't.
Really think oh this person is gonna.
Like tell on me you know i mean or you.
Don't think of that i would think.
Because it's i mean i don't know right.
But that's kind of what i think of like.
When i if i'm sneaking from his point of.
View now see for wil and i we've had.
Experiences not maybe not directly but.
We're a friend of ours or something has.
Spoken to an underage person you know.
And and unknowingly yeah you do you do.
Well me personally knowing i didn't.
Nothing happened nothing happened though.
Whoa.
We got you exclusives all right okay.
What epochal do so see this is out this.
Is also for like my and my stand-up.
Stuff but basically this what do you see.
In your head at but it was it was on.
Tinder and to be on tinder you have to.
Be 18 and over and so this girl on there.
Had her ages 19 and then so we're just.
Talking and you know it's just talking.
Getting to know each other and then how.
Old were you at the time i oh this is.
Like maybe a couple of months ago you're.
28 okay so we're just.
Talking and then we exchanged snapchat.
And still talking on there and then she.
Goes oh by the way i turn 18 next week.
And then i said yikes.
And then she said don't worry the legal.
Age of consent in nevada is 16 and then.
I said double yikes.
Dude what so this is the scary thing cuz.
What if what if you already assumed.
Right what how old she was.
Yeah and you had already said things.
That were sexual to her yeah and then.
She said that you'd still be in trouble.
Yeah even if you didn't know luckily i.
Didn't say anything though yeah no i.
Know but i mean that that's that's the.
That's happens to people oh yeah.
Definitely it happens all the time yeah.
Well that's that's that's scary like i.
Think in your instance it was uh i mean.
You know it better so you wanna yeah i.
Mean it's not really my story to tell so.
I mean i wasn't exactly in the situation.
But essentially like i had a friend.
Growing up who yeah got in trouble and.
Got accused of doing stuff with younger.
Girls but he like pled not guilty like.
He went through the whole process and.
The system is kind of like set up to.
Like of course like favor of the victim.
In that which i guess it should be but.
It's also like you would hope that the.
System is fair and stuff like that but.
Depending on which side has more.
Resources right more family has like.
More money for lawyers and stuff like.
That obviously that's a big difference.
Within the legal system and so yeah it.
Like completely affected his life in a.
Negative way and so i have at least on.
My for my experiences and like my.
Opinions on that kind of stuff it's.
Affected by that yeah because he was a.
Friend of mine and i obviously believe.
Him that he said like he didn't do.
Anything right and so let's just say.
Like what happens if like they're in a.
Bar a place that's suppose your seems to.
Be 21 and over.
Right and there's bouncers who are.
Supposed to check ids now let's say that.
Something happens after that you know i.
Don't know who should be at fault i.
Would say i mean i know i know who is at.
Fault or ii the person it's gonna get i.
Don't i don't think it's right but i.
Think the person that falls should be.
The bar bar should be you know how to.
Accountable for letting this person fool.
Them and then that kid or whoever it is.
You know using a fake id to get in there.
Should be in trouble as well you.
Shouldn't just be the person who's.
Talking to this person unknowingly yeah.
It's different from what that guy did.
When he knew that that girl was underage.
I think like i mean i think this.
Scenario i might be completely off-base.
There might be a reason why i don't know.
If you guys can think of a reason why i.
Just think it's not.
It's not fair like sometimes girls or.
Guys even look a lot older than they are.
And then it's vice versa sometimes.
People look a lot younger than what how.
Old they are yeah so i mean it's hard to.
Say just based off looks and you're not.
Gonna go up to every person you mean be.
Like hey before we talk how old are you.
Yeah and even then it was the motion.
Illegally you're supposed to yeah and.
Then if it's a fake id then what yeah.
What do you do you just go to jail i.
Think it's different to like if you know.
If he's the person that has like if the.
Girl right is underage and the guy has.
Knowledge that she's underage yeah and.
The guy continues that's you're in.
Trouble.
Agree you should be in trouble like if.
You know like i don't know what this i.
Don't know anything about that situation.
But if he was like oh i know you're.
Underage let's wait till you're old or.
Whatever and then they kept talking yeah.
In that scenario supposedly in the dms.
Yeah that she took video of or something.
Like that he said some like will you.
Wait well he acknowledged like do you.
Want to wait to you're 18 mm-hmm so he.
Knew yeah that's probably allegedly.
Around a lot allegedly.
No but just because we don't get you.
Know yeah caught up in anything i.
Allegedly farted on this podcast did not.
That's quiet anyway speaking of well the.
Thing is that this kind of correlates to.
What we were talking about before to.
Where she ain't no shame show that to.
Shane's incident last year about him you.
Know he had that whole pedophilia thing.
Cuz he made some jokes and whether it.
Was taken out of context or not that.
Happened again this week this past week.
Where shane.
I guess he's getting something.
Resurfaced about him saying something.
About him doing something sexual to his.
Cats or we had the quote right yeah i.
Don't know if he want to read it cuz.
It's pretty it's pretty graphic but uh.
It was on an episode a now-deleted.
Episode of shane and friends on.
September 11th 2015 he says one time i.
Laid my cat down on her back ellipses i.
Moved her little chicken legs spread.
Open or whatever and i came all over the.
Cat it was my first sexual experience.
What was it the head nice trying to.
Bleep myself out there's no bleep all.
Right well and he says i was also like.
But he didn't so he didn't say the.
Reason why there's controversies people.
Have pulled that clip up right and i.
Guess it didn't seem like he was joking.
In that supposedly it seemed like a real.
Story like he was telling a real story.
And that's what people have the base off.
Of it right but he for i guess in the in.
His public statement that he issued he.
Was talking about how it was kind of.
Like based off an awful sketch that he.
Never did or anything so he did he say.
That though in the i didn't see the.
Actual interview but did he say like oh.
This is based off of a sketch i think it.
Was in the interview as a tweet oh i see.
Well then well i mean okay well they.
Need there's no context there he kind of.
Put that out there mmm.
I could see why people would be upset i.
Mean but uh honestly i don't i don't i.
Know shane that's the cut that's like.
His comedy ya know but i don't know i.
Can see why people would take that.
Another way but you also said that like.
Gee he's been in trouble for a lot worse.
Things he said a lot worse than yes and.
He's done videos that are significantly.
He doesn't make videos like that anymore.
Yeah but his his stuff before was pretty.
Raunchy well that was like his last.
Sentence was um.
I learned my lesson and i'm more.
Confident now my ability to about.
Entertaining not just being myself and.
Not being so shocking well that's his.
Apology yeah he made so he had to make.
An apology for this and i granted this.
Is again back when he used to make those.
Kind of jokes i'm gonna assume yeah i.
Mean it's cons it is way different now.
It is wait yeah yeah and i think that.
Shows like the growth in who he is and.
Like who you know and like how he is.
Transformed his entire brand how he has.
Grown is not just a content creator but.
As a person how like you can come from a.
Place where a lot of people will deem it.
As like oh this is like inappropriate.
And raunchy and now but the thing is it.
Always comes back to haunt you because.
Anything you put online will be there.
Forever and it's happening every single.
Year something is targeting shane.
Because the more successful he gets the.
More of a target he becomes yeah and.
That's what really what it comes down to.
And we said it before like shane's.
Killing it right now and he's made like.
A very like slick transition into like.
What his brand is now.
And it's very sick he's very successful.
And they're like ryan said that's it now.
He's an even bigger target so it's like.
But we do have to say congratulations.
Right to shane.
Cuz you got engaged oh yeah yeah for.
What the cat forget i shoulda got.
Engaged congrats to shane um but yeah.
That's kind of unfortunate that that's.
Happening right now when he announced.
That engagement yeah so um do you guys.
Feel that there should be a time period.
Of like after five years certain tweets.
Are like you know you should let those.
Go to eliminations you're like.
Presenters kind of yeah like if you.
Commit certain crimes after a certain.
Amount of time you can't be charged for.
Them you're smart.
What do you mean such okay well i mean.
There's certain things certain crimes.
That have that yeah murder is not one of.
Them yeah.
I can't murder someone and then 20 years.
Later you're good yeah if they find out.
You're still you know yeah i think at.
Least so tweets um i think i personally.
Think it never will be that way but it.
Should be because things change a lot.
Agreed society changes and you change.
Yeah like so like in memory in the in.
The how to be ninja video we used the fa.
G word yeah and that wasn't targeted at.
Gay people yeah it had a different.
Meaning for me growing up you know in in.
Hawaii specifically saying that word not.
That i would even say it now saying that.
Word had a different meaning in that it.
Wasn't even necessarily it didn't mean.
Gay it was like a homophobic slur no no.
No it just meant it was just like.
Something you said to your friends to.
Make fun of your friends but it wasn't.
Meant gay it became like a it was more.
Like ave action like how you acted no.
Like an adjective.
Yeah and then people just associated the.
Two and it became well this i'm just.
Saying from hawaii didn't differ your.
Point of view yeah the way we grew up.
People used to sit and it wasn't like.
You could say that before you know gay.
People used to say that we talked about.
Yes they used to say that to you.
Thanks man well i mean everybody use i.
Mean it wasn't like it was like another.
It wasn't a good word it was still an.
Insult yeah but it didn't mean gay.
It was a gay and that word was.
Completely different very you took that.
Down right there's that video we have it.
It was down yeah and then i think it.
Might be blocked something like that.
Yeah unlisted or something like that but.
But that's part of you growing out okay.
Yeah i'd know better i've already said i.
Apologized for it like i didn't know.
Back then i was 16 and even then like it.
Was a different time yeah i wouldn't.
Make that video now i mean not like that.
You know we even called it out in.
Another video so i think yeah i mean i.
Think things change over time something.
Like i said last time something we're.
Saying right now could become something.
Offensive in five to ten years from now.
Yeah oh exactly we don't know yet it's.
One of those things where obviously.
There's like a limit of like how bad is.
The tweet all right then it's gonna be.
Like then that kind of determines i.
Think like obviously if you say.
Something super racist on twitter ten.
Years ago you should probably have to.
Explain it yeah like no matter what you.
Should be like even if it's something.
Like well i was racist back then you.
Know i'm saying like yeah now i'm not.
Like now i've learned i've changed you.
Think people do you think people that.
That have had that change and did.
Realized a mistake should still be you.
Know attacked for what they did in the.
Past even if they acknowledge it mmm no.
I don't think yeah i don't think so.
There's actually i saw there's mini.
Documentary about how this former like.
Races and like we say racist a lot that.
We did we do but this guy who used to be.
Like a white supremacist no word babies.
But he realized that his actions turned.
Around and started and he was a tattoo.
Artist and he would change people's.
Tattoos who that used to have like oh.
That's like white supremists meanings.
And stuff and and changed yeah and and.
Make it into something entirely new.
That's so for people who wanted.
Redemption yeah yeah and so that's like.
A good story now if people were like.
Whoa but you're races and little and.
Just like attacking what people could.
Yeah people say he became big enough.
Like he became the next pewdiepie yeah.
Like that's how popular i guess.
You people would protest him mmm it.
Would say stop supporting this guy just.
Because he's he's taking advantage of.
What you know you used to do he he would.
Get attacked i'm 100% sure that that for.
Sure but then those people are just.
Stupid idiots are they though they're.
Mad that's what i'm asking that like.
Those types of people yeah oh my thank.
You - but i'm just saying i mean grab my.
Sleeve it's it would happen if that guy.
Even if he means you know he's he.
Acknowledges he apologizes he's even.
Making up for it in what he does it.
Becomes as famous as a pewdiepie anyone.
Even a shame he is gonna get attacked.
For sure he's sorry for what he did and.
There's gonna be people trying to take.
Him down.
Yeah and it's only because of his.
Popularity but that doesn't mean that.
Those people are right yes they're gonna.
Do that but those people are morons.
That's i agree with that yeah because.
That is like a huge part of changing the.
World for the better.
Yeah as cheesy as corny as that sounds.
Taking the people that think a certain.
Way that's like super bad right yeah.
White supremacists and then 10 years.
Later they're not and they've changed.
Yeah you absolutely want to praise that.
Person for making that change yes you do.
Not want to attacked him for what they.
Used to believe you know i'm saying.
Because that's important it's like.
Changing vote but coming from not saying.
That i agree but coming from a different.
Perspective right.
That guy becomes that powerful and you.
You know you don't think that person.
Should have that power because of their.
Past and the way that they used to think.
Because you don't trust how they think.
Wouldn't you want to say stop this stop.
This guy you don't want him to have.
Influence yeah okay well then why can't.
That guy become president that no really.
It would allow him to become president.
What his past being that i think the.
Thing for me what i would see is like.
Right oh this guy has had a bad past.
Right he's aware of it he's admitted to.
It and that shows a lot more morals and.
Bowser and a lot of the people who are.
Like look at how perfect i am it's just.
Like no you're not perfect you're just.
Really good at hiding your your real.
Past or true intentions or however.
You've been you know because everybody.
Has that that sense of like evil and.
Then we're human we naturally have evil.
Tendencies we're very selfish creatures.
And to be able to that evil though what.
Being selfish a little bit i mean.
Everybody is selfish.
Please evil but we have yeah that's why.
Everybody has like natural evil in them.
But to be able to be like okay i this is.
My past this is what happened but now i.
Want to move forward and use how i.
Overcame this situation to inspire other.
People and show like there's a lot.
Better to life and how we should be.
Treating people in a positive and humane.
Matter that that type of person i would.
Be a lot more like oh i know more about.
Him i can't relate to this i can respect.
That then someone who is like this is.
What i want.
I'm perfection and all this because i'm.
Like that's not attainable you're a.
Lying you're lying somewhere could be.
When what you're saying is people maybe.
Just don't believe that they've made an.
Honest change that's what i mean yeah.
That's i mean because and that's up.
That's totally up to them i mean whether.
Or not they believe them or not is is up.
To the own is it yeah this goes back to.
Pewdiepie and you see the comments to.
Where people still call them out like oh.
How can you support a white supremacist.
Or someone who said the n-word or.
Whatever and whether you apologized for.
It or not and i mean he did there's.
Always gonna be those people yeah right.
But you're slowly starting to see people.
Be like okay well he acknowledged it.
Like reasonable people right and you.
Know when you really break down what he.
Did honey we're not gonna get into that.
Anyway but those people are always gonna.
Be there.
Yeah and if you but if you think about.
It it's not a minority like if you think.
About a different situation like say a.
President or candidate right someone.
Running for president you find out that.
This person used to be a white.
Supremacist or a racist or whatever they.
Did something really bad in the past and.
All of us and they acknowledge it right.
That person never will win yeah he would.
Never become president but i will say.
There's a difference in finding out that.
This person has that oh but what if he.
Acknowledges it from the start if you.
Presents in malia or someone even have a.
Chance i could say so yeah you think so.
I think so.
Alright then maybe there's a new.
Strategy for some presidential candidate.
There just come on the podcast and we'll.
Teach you our techniques to winning the.
Presidency paco seems to know a lot.
I i agree with you i think that would be.
Super interesting i think this is a very.
Honest person exactly but in the eyes of.
Other people would they be like well why.
Would i take this guy when there's this.
Other guy who would like you said we.
Know he's not perfect but on paper he is.
I don't have an answer i don't i'm just.
Like trying to give another perspective.
I'm not even saying i agree with that.
I'm just trying to see like from another.
From their perspective i mean of course.
Their policies would matter and.
Everything but on him but say it was.
Exactly the same and you had a guy with.
A past who acknowledges it versus a guy.
Who is perfect on paper but you know.
Their stuff you just would never find.
Out i'm a i would honestly be pretty.
Stuck between the two i might pick the.
Guy like with more flaws in the back.
History just because it he shows growth.
He shows a lot of growth you know and.
For that type of growth in somebody i.
Don't see why they can't inspire other.
People around them to be able to push.
Through there they're hard issues in.
Life yeah i mean i don't think there has.
Ever been like a candidate that that.
Came out and said i used to be this and.
Now i'm this and be like super.
Vulnerable in that sense i don't know if.
That would have the would be was obama.
Saying that he smoked weed before i.
Don't know if they found that out or he.
Just said oh yeah i smoked weed in.
College like i don't know if that was.
Like - because weed was a hot topic and.
Like i'm not that's true right that's.
What he said i i might be lying i don't.
Know i think that's like then and that's.
Super relatable people were like and.
Then people were okay with weed and he.
Said this is another thing had you said.
That maybe ten years ago 15 let's say 15.
Years ago he would be like oh my god.
He's a drug addict yeah no weed wasn't.
Seen the same way as it is today yeah.
That's for sure right well i think it.
Comes down to the it's like the.
Whoever's believed the listening or.
Whoever's listening whether or not they.
Believe it or not it's like kind of you.
Can transition into like the mj story.
Right or like whatever that was do you.
Guys watch the documentary i did not.
I've read about it well i didn't watch.
It yeah.
Because it comes out of like what you.
Believe like whose story yeah because.
You know facts aside or whether or not.
There are facts or are not facts it's.
Like this person says this this person.
Says this so yeah it's like it's up to.
The person to believe like i know i.
Should watch it because i should be.
Up-to-date on those things i just really.
Don't want to yeah because and it's just.
A personal thing yeah i just don't want.
To root like i know it's like oh that's.
Sort your response but like.
I don't know like i said i should watch.
It but i just don't want to ruin my.
Vision of what i currently see yeah and.
I think that is you can call that.
Whatever it is but i mean i also like.
You said it's coming from someone's.
Story it's not yeah he's not the venoms.
Of either so that's just that's unfair.
Yeah i should probably watch it nothing.
Is i'm probably much oh we see she.
Breaks she she break i need to refill.
Anyway so refill.
She should break come back yes no don't.
Come back no no no we need the junior.
Out role cheeky break okay do you.

Some tickets cost 20 bucks i don't know.
What but it's kind of cheap so don't.
Forget.
Oh speaking of tickets i think i.
Mentioned this earlier but i saw when i.
Was driving on the highway here i saw.
This this billboard and read in link.
We're actually gonna be at green valley.
Ranch yeah this is not a promo for them.
But i just saw them i was like oh that's.
Pretty cool no it's a promo and now they.
Have to be on this podcast and they have.
To pay us yeah no i just saw i don't.
Know what it is but like their tickets.
Were like i don't know like less than 20.
Bucks do we get if cg does that do we.
Get paid to go no i just saw them on the.
Bill i thought that was cool anyway yeah.
We're back we're back you wouldn't ever.
Do live shows yeah what do you mean i.
Used to i know but now i mean i'm not a.
Hundred percent of polls i just don't.
Know what i would do.
I don't know so how much opposed would.
You be hardy post-16 not just 16 okay i.
Mean i'm not that opposed to doing shows.
I just i don't like the travel part i.
Don't mind doing shows i just don't have.
Anything to do mmm.
Like when we did ytf and toured and.
Stuff i was just the host like that's.
Not hard to do just get the crowd for.
The real talent.
What you do in manila then i did like a.
Very poor version of a song that people.
Know that's it you danced as well yeah.
But it's not like rio dancing it's like.
Watching very very very amateur people.
Do very very amateur singing and dancing.
But it's because it's us it's better.
Than nothing you know that's how people.
See it oh at least they're trying but.
It's awful like it's it's but it's bad.
Like i mean our performances were bad in.
Comparison to real dancers and real.
Singers it was better but very close to.
Nothing yes yeah but it is better than.
Nothing it's like at least which it's.
Better than us just coming out and doing.
Nothing yeah i think that's why i wanted.
To do it.
And it's like kind of like schizo we do.
Like live skits away but yeah i'm not.
I'm not a performer you are you doing i.
Mean like to do stuff like that yeah.
Because i need attention and that's all.
What i'm fueled off of but i want.
Attention attention too but that's what.
Drives me and this tiny thing i have but.
For you if you if you could do something.
I guess what would you like to do if you.
Had the ability to show yeah yeah.
Honestly i've always wanted to do like a.
I mean not just my stuff i would want to.
00 like if.
I had dancers and i had singers and make.
Make us basically a long video mm-hmm.
But live mmm this is a place behind a.
Kind of but like in using different.
Talents i wouldn't personally want to be.
In it director kind of like a director.
Writer i guess and then kind of okay i.
Have this talent and i have this talent.
And this time how can i make this all.
Work and then make it like epic at the.
End and you know like follow a video.
Thing where you build up something plan.
Things in the beginning have them like.
Slowly water it and then pay off at the.
End like i don't know i just think.
That's fun that part of it not me.
Actually being in in do you like.
Musicals mmm it depends depends i don't.
I never used to but it depends i like.
The ones that have actual story and it's.
Not just for the sake of singing yeah so.
Like have you seen wicked no where's.
That it's i like a spin-off of wizard of.
Oz oh but it's like from the witches.
Perspective and stuff it's actually.
Pretty good.
Is it a movie or a musical like where.
Did you see it in a theater in a theatre.
But like a musical theater oh oh i see i.
See.
Yeah yeah here no in hawaii oh yeah.
Sounds great yeah it's pretty dope i.
Seen the lion king one oh that one's.
Uber good so it's pretty it's cool.
Because i've already seen the movie and.
It's you're getting to see it how they.
Are doing it alive.
That's the only cool part to me yeah but.
Like i don't know i know i wasn't i was.
A big fan of musicals how about you will.
Am i a big fan of musicals like what.
Have you seen.
I saw the nutcracker when i was super.
Young excited music oh yeah it's a toy.

Something i've never liked a battle has.
A ballet in it it's very classical oh i.
Didn't know yeah it's like christmas toy.
Story yeah are you making this up.
No no nutcracker oh song - yeah i've.
Heard of nutcracker by pretty sure it's.
That little toy thing with the yeah.
That's what it is story the story is.
Like this girl gets it and then it like.
Comes alive or something somebody copied.
Somebody he just had that netflix i was.
Watching that.
Alright i liked it i know as i like to.
Go back and watch old movies that now.
When i watch them i'm like damn i know.
This isn't good but i love it because of.
It just reminds me of a different time a.
Time where i used to lie in front of my.
Tv and eat nectarines technically i.
Think the nutcrackers a ballet no i.
Think about it oh yeah you got to be.
Technical people will get on you for.
That when i did music was in real life.
The video mm-hmm i got so many comments.
That were like these aren't real.
Musicals like you guys are left out how.
Could you leave out this and hamilton.
These are just disney movies i don't.
Know why they sound like that but get.
Him yeah but they were so salty i was.
Like i didn't know there was such a clan.
Behind musicals yeah yeah they meet they.
I was i guess i insulted them i'm sorry.
I don't know my musicals hey don't.
Apologize any other podcast i'm sorry.
Every time on musicals uh twitter.
Questions we should get those we have we.
Have to get through some of those all of.
Them it's my favorite part is it your.
Favorite part i like we'll start off.
With this awesome comments going hey do.
The twitter questions paco shut up yeah.
Yeah they're hating on me for that and.
I'm not sorry all right.
More a job more than that it says to.
Talk about dead series such as park.
Horus willing greg while.
Cars cooking but not really teatime and.
I dare you will they make a return and.
The gang like making these videos bed.
Alright they're not dead we just haven't.
Had everybody around recently they're.
Hibernating bro so normally when we do.
Those videos before it's because people.
Were always free right and now derek's.
In china china he's coming back he's.
Coming back in a week.
Pretty cheap roll weeks he's gone for a.
Month yeah he's dancing in a job walkie.
Show um that's not private information.
Is it no he's dancing in a show so he.
Had to be what he was gone for a week.
And then sean was gone for life no shot.
Well not that we couldn't do it without.
Him because we have like even like park.
Horses only five people hmm oh four five.
Five people it's been so long it's dead.
I know i can already forgot but we do.
Need to do a tee time because we have a.
Lot of stuff that stuff filed we do have.
To do that i'm down to do a part course.
For a while i couldn't because i had.
Ankle issues from basketball but i think.
I'm good now injuries definitely played.
A pretty big like par course you need to.
Be like physically ready ready.
Dude i'm winning the next one you always.
Say that now i'm confident this time.
Anyway the first time paco was on par.
Course i think what episode was at the.
Bridge one though on the pond was the.
Bridge or played one yeah when he jumped.
Over a little river thing yeah yeah.
Whatever episode that was paco before.
That this is before he did any part.
Course he would just watch them and i.
Think on video it looks a lot easier so.
He was just like he was so confident.
Yeah and he was like we should we should.
Have bet him because he i knew he could.
There are certain things that you just.
It's harder than it looks.
I'm wearing shoes next time okay yeah.
That's the problem you got out the first.
One i was the first one i ran into a.
Water those that don't know park horse.
Is our series where we do parkour but.
It's our version like it's it's not.
Parkour yeah we do stunts but it's like.
Horse so like if someone does something.
Then the next person follows i like that.
Series it's just i for a long time i was.
Hurt and then you know not everybody was.
Around i read by people did a good way.
To describe it is that it's not nothing.
It's a little bit better than nothing.
It's amateur people doing parkour.
The other thing is when we made it we.
Were like 21 and now we're almost 31 so.
What yeah not us.
Well i mean on average yeah 29 you know.
Well we did it i think the first thing.
We did in australia which is me greg and.
You greg and sean john yeah and we were.
Just you always had the idea but we'd.
Never did it we just bore we're in we're.
At a show where i was doing something.
Like hosting and we were in the green.
Room for like six hours or something.
Like that we had time to kill so we just.
Started turning on the camera stuff we.
Already did.
Mm-hmm but yeah that show did really.
Well yeah we should probably do one did.
I made a best of parkour video for you.
To post its but that's just like the.
Same stuff people have seen yeah but.
That's like a good a it's coming back.
Okay well we'll do a trailer then how.
About that make it a trailer yeah.
Well greg willing greg is it is it dead.
It's probably dead i don't know we're.
Gonna make it.
Maybe wild card is dead maybe no is it.
Coming back big into that zone i don't.
Know cooking but not really i could see.
Us making that probably more than any.
Other ones yeah actually when shawn was.
Here visiting he we were like going to.
Do it but then he we only thought of it.
On the last day this no it isn't gonna.
Take all day those takes so much longer.
Than people think because we don't know.
What we're gonna do to that day yeah so.
Half the day is me and shawn just like.
Hey what if we did like a burrito.
But it's pizza like that's right yeah.
Most times it's not something that we.
That's good like the one time we did.
That one for shawn like i got the.
Experience whatever you like it's ours 2.
To 3 hours with us just sitting there.
Like what should we do yeah as a cos.
This relate to short like you know it's.
It's a lot yeah it's it's genuine i mean.
It's not fake like we don't like we do.
It for real yeah so it's not like us.
Like we're not pretending like we're not.
Coming up with it on the spot.
Tv time you already said yep tee time.
Again i dare you we do it just now.
There's so many rules on youtube.
Everything i all the i dare use most of.
The i dare use that i put up got.
Demonetised or age-restricted because.
It's like dangerous things or gross.
Things so it's like it's tough i mean.
I'll still probably i'm still open to.
Doing them yeah it's just we make.
Nothing.
Off of them so unless seatgeek wants to.
As well it's pretty hard to do it and.
Commit to it something that you are.
Probably gonna lose money off yeah oh.
Yeah it's a big umbrella answer for this.
Is as a good time schedules lining up.
Because derek coming back healthy.
Rebecca having everyone available one.
Day you know that's pretty rare so it's.
We need we'll bring it back and we need.
To start some new stuff too yeah some.
New shows cuz it get tired of doing the.
Same stuff yeah um next question from.
Kelsey crushing neck what are your guys.
Thoughts on the cancel culture what is.
Canceled we already touched on it a.
Little bit but it's kind of like where.
If somebody says something or it gets.
Brought up from their past every uh that.
All twitter will just be like oh this.
Person's can so that's exactly what we.
Talked about yeah exactly.
So we already touched okay and this does.
That come from like if you get a show.
Cancelled i have no idea that's like.
Roseann trouble when you get your show.
Cancelled yeah i think i think in.
General it's just like the new thing.
Yeah like if somebody does something and.
Damn you're cancelled i didn't know it.
Was called that okay me neither which i.
Was like makes sense yeah and then like.
Outraged calls your type of thing i like.
Anthony we kind of get out of here give.
Our opinion you're cancelled give our.
Opinion on that area i think right yeah.
We definitely did okay.
Thank you kelsey sky wings do you guys.
Have any goals or dreams you'd like to.
Accomplish some time in your lives which.
Are maybe outside of youtube oh an.
Example hobbies skills or places to miss.
Well go ahead you seem excited i mean i.
Have a lot of hobbies as you know you.
Have too many hobbies one that was like.
Actually a realization for me was um.
It's like so weird and random another.
Thing you guys know this but it was i.
Was traveling i think it might have been.
Coming back from twitchcon and i was in.
The airport and i saw someone who was a.
Dog handler like you know like they like.
She's you know sniffing for security.
Person security person but they have a.
Dog and i was like yeah i think i could.
Do that yeah you have a dog and i really.
Like working with dogs on that like like.
That level of training them and like.
Having giving them something they feel.
Fulfilled you know and like giving them.
The work and stuff and but will it ever.
Happen i don't know probably probably.
Not cuz that's like a huge commitment.
Yeah i have to be super like educated.
And a lot of i think a lot of people in.
That field are usually probably like.
Ex-military or you know police police.
Work and stuff like that but i think as.
Like a random career hobby thing that.
I'll be really interested in oddly.
Enough that is kind of it for me that's.
Really specific i remember seeing it and.
Go because they were working with a new.
Dog and that's why they were actually.
Actively training and so um i was.
Looking i was like man that looks really.
Cool and like fulfilling and fun and and.
Then it's just one of those realizations.
That you see something and you're like.
Yeah i think you could do that kind of.
Thing how about you man you have a lot.
Of i have a lot of things you're i love.
Myself as weird you're one of those.
People that you get really excited about.
Something and you put so much effort.
Into it and then something else comes up.
And then you put so much effort into it.
And then sometimes you bounce back to.
Those things and you put so much effort.
Into it and i'm kind of like at you.
Jumping around yeah i'm kind of like.
That as well like you want to be a.
Rapper.
At one point no i didn't want to be a.
Rapper oh what i just did it cuz it's.
Fun.

Stand-up which you have been putting.
Time into yeah which is i think you.
Would be good at i think you actually.

Good.
You just don't believe in yourself that.
Way yeah this goes back to the beginning.
Of the podcast i don't believe i think.
You could i think you're good at writing.
Jokes and you could figure out a way to.
Deliver them in like i don't know you.
Know what it is though have bad memory.
That's also true.
I would you spend on a lotta time but.
You could make it like a thing where.
You're just like sitting up there.
Reading jokes you know that's like could.
Be a thing all right yeah i mean jokes.
Rogan something like specifically adam.
Tell me you're good tell me a good joke.

Audience comedy oh but i don't like fake.
Movie trailers like music videos like.
Sketches i say like do people ever say.
Oh tell me a joke then or something like.

Okay why i don't know it just feels.
Weird when people say oh tell me a joke.

Career wise so yeah i know i'm what.
Wouldn't be i mean i would love to be a.
Nba basketball player too short and i.

Don't answer it we also don't look at.
Social media what do you mean you know.

Think of one like specifically that.
Annoys me mm-hmm all right this is from.
Vanessa specifically to you well how did.
You meet your girlfriend monica oh you.
Talked about this oh i don't think so so.
How so we had a group of step boys we.
Talked about that last podcast before to.
To last one with us yeah and then dom.
Dietrich so when i was like 16 they.
Started going to a gymnastics place and.
That's the one that monica's parents.
Owned they owned a gymnastics place and.
Its really pretty common or she's really.
Fortunate for breakers to be able to go.
To a gymnastic center and work on stuff.
Because you can work on flips you can do.
Stuff in a setting that you won't get.
Super hurt right yeah yeah and so that.
Was like a big deal so we started like.
Going there and then dom actually.
Started talking to monica well i think i.
Was 16 i was really young how old is how.
Old is monica they were at the time i.
Mean she's only a couple years older.
Yeah a few years older i was 16 or 17 so.
We were kids.
And then so that was how she kind of.
Like knew everyone was like she started.
Hanging out with the actual breakdancing.
Crew yeah which was what dom was in and.
She was in their crew she was in a.
Better way better dancer than i was and.
Yeah so that's basically how she kind of.
Came into like our group of friends and.
That many many many many years later.
They had like dated for just a little.
While and then separated and then kind.
Of we started going there right and then.
Dom went to la and became superstar and.
Became famous and then we we were.
Luckily able to use her dance place.
Right for because we didn't have that.
Much money we needed a place to practice.
And so we started going there and then i.
Don't remember it was like someone's.
Birthday we went out and we just kind of.
Made out started talking and then i was.
Like and i showed her some sweet dance.
Moves yeah and then she was like that's.
Exactly what happened but that's really.

How we met initially on that set and we.
Weren't dating obviously we're just.
Working and it was after i guess after.
We finished filming we kind of stayed in.
Touch and we kind of started hanging out.
More we weren't really dating um but.
Basically it didn't work out we were.

But there's been this radio show i've.
Been listening to it here and they do.
Like these prank calls and they're super.
Basically a friend will recommend hate.
Prank call my friend hmm and they come.
Up with these scenarios and they get all.
This information so they really make it.
Feel real i want to do something like.
That i think we could do it live i think.
It'd be funnier though if we did it to.
Other youtubers maybe cuz they know of.
You people like you know yeah yeah.
Almost like a punk'd but if we would.
Have to get permission from the friend.
Because that's how we would get the.
Information yeah it's hard to prank.
Youtubers cuz they already get pranked.
Like a lie you do is i know that even me.
Like i don't answer any calls unless i.
Know who it is so i don't know just.
Something that is just try think of.
