Let's see focused i am so i forgot what.
This was light i'm filming by myself.
Today it's been like years since i've.
Done that in fact i am gonna be editing.
This all by myself which i haven't done.
In a long time but then i realize i got.
A new computer and i don't have premiere.
So i'm gonna be using imovie remember.
This stuff stuff we used to do old.
School youtube hmm hey guys so just like.
The title says and i'm sure many of you.
Have already noticed i have been taking.
A little bit of a break from youtube and.
I know that sounds a little bit.
Misleading because i have been posting.
Every week but just the podcast and i.
Have been posting twice a week on higatv.
But when i say take a break i mean you.
Guys know if you've been on this channel.
Long enough this is not my normal type.
Of type of content and i know i probably.
Should have made this video before i.
Took this little break because that is.
What normal youtubers do instead of just.
You know upsetting their subscribers and.
Making them comment like where are you.
Haven't you been posting but do you know.
Me i like to go against the grain and by.
That i mean go against what you should.
Do in order to maintain your youtube.
Channel but that's okay because there's.
Still quite a handful of you that are.
Still here and i'm i actually very much.
So appreciate that very much so a pre i.
Actually very i actually i appreciate.
You guys and that's why i felt the need.
To kind of explain myself in this video.
For those of you that don't know i had.
Been making videos for a long time on.
Youtube since 2006 about 13 years you.
Know i started in a time where you could.
Not make money off of youtube and the.
Videos i started off doing a really.
Crappy you know so for me the fun part.
Was always just trying to get better.
Than the last video and just keep.
Improving and draw more fans to you and.
See what you can do to be better and.
Essentially just make better content.
Because the better your content was i.
Mean the more youtube would promote it.
And that kind of just fit with my motto.
Of always wanting to improve and make.
Something better than the last video.
That was always my goal but in the past.
Five or six years youtube changed that a.
Lot and maybe it was even earlier than.
That youtube's algorithm change and.
Basically it became about watch time so.
You wanted to make longer videos.
And you wanted people to be watching.
Them all the way through and for the.
Longest time i tried to fight that.
System and i always believed that you.
Know you should focus on quality and not.
Quantity even though that the sacrifice.
You know a whole month of not posting.
Videos which will take a hit on your bun.
Your buns there's no other way to.
Describe that just snorted a little bit.
But no other way to describe it it would.
Take a hit on your income because you're.
Not posting obviously less people are.
Watching your other videos as well and.
For me i was actually okay with that.
Because like i said it was never really.
About the numbers and stuff i just the.
Thing i really cared about was putting.
Out good content and stuff that i was.
Excited and happy to make you know me.
And the guys were working on it we were.
Happy about it we didn't necessarily.
Care as long as you know a decent amount.
Of use or i could still pay everyone it.
Worked but over time as i kept trying to.
Do that the videos got crazier that.
Times it took to make it got longer i.
Don't know i don't even know when.
Exactly it started to happen but i was.
Subconsciously i think getting a little.
Frustrated with youtube and getting.
Getting really just bitter i guess with.
How what what youtube had become seeing.
The kind of content that was suddenly at.
The top of the food chain that i mean i.
Have nothing against you know when all.
The dish traps and stuff was happening i.
Actually it was one of the people who.
Said i don't blame them at all they're.
Actually doing what's what's what you.
Should be doing for your career that's.
Smart if i was a smart businessperson i.
Probably would have followed that trend.
I am not i go against the grain but.
Anyway i'm getting a little off track.
Essentially to make this long story a.
Little bit shorter i was getting.
Frustrated with the way youtube had.
Become and i guess i don't know when it.
Started to happen but i started to i had.
A i got a very bad attitude having the.
Hollows to describe it it happened very.
Slowly like over time like i don't know.
If you guys know this or not but over.
The past few years i'm not gonna say.
Every single video but there's a lot of.
Videos in the past few years that i.
Posted that i knew for a fact could have.
Been better it wasn't ready to go out it.
Wasn't something i was proud of and i.
Was not happy about if i wasn't laughing.
At it it wasn't good to me and i was not.
Laughing it i would see 90% of the.
Videos i posted in the last three years.
And the finding is the ones i really.
Liked or the ones that didn't do well.
The ones that i hated did super well.
Just because they were the right topic.
Or because they had the right like the.
Right title or the right thumbnail.
We're soul encouraging they're like oh.
My god right this is so brilliant this.
Is so smart i love this oh my god you're.
The only genuine youtuber or whatever.
It's not making funny i'm not making fun.
Of you guys i actually really appreciate.
It all i'm saying is i'm trying to.
Explain that from my perspective i don't.
Know why but i would feel worse because.
I knew that it wasn't i didn't deserve.
It i don't know what see i have some.
Psychological issues i don't know what.
That is and i know like i said it sounds.
Super first world problem problem me i.
Mean it is a first world problem but.
It's a real it was a problem for me like.
I said maybe you have mental issues i.
Don't know what it is.
This is a hard video for me to post i.
Know it's not fun or funny it's not what.
You're used to but it it's just more of.
An update and i don't know why i vented.
This to you guys but i felt like for the.
Few of you that cared this is the reason.
Why the content has changed but again as.
Much as i said i haven't think in a.
Break from youtube there has been videos.
That we've been working on if you do is.
That i actually had fun doing here's a.
Little little preview of some of them.
Coming out i brought back a little bit.
Of cooking but not really oh oh oh do.
You know no see kids you want to cut the.
Nipple off so they do the longer shows.
They're hella fast ever watch those.
Videos you're like pretty good yeah i.
Did another ryan tries where i got to.
Paint some similarly kinda like a bob.
Ross type a video just because i always.
Wanted to paint just continue to paint.
The entire canvas same color it already.
Is there's no mistakes here hopefully.
Gets a little bit lighter it's not.
Instruction across okay that's that's.
Not a happy cloud it's a little angry.
Might have gotten a little bit of black.
On the brush another big whoops free.
Tree needs a friend there's no trees.
That have no friends because they would.
Die you can't tell what one color starts.
And where another one began.
I can't see it also colorblind we did.
Another trickshot video and that one is.
Not something i mean that's one i gotta.
Thank our old videos but really it's in.
The arcade so like it wasn't excuse for.
Me to just play in arcade games all day.
Anyway i'm living the life i know i'm.
Sorry i'm having fun making videos again.
That's my main thing that's why i.
Haven't been posting videos because i'm.
Having fun making them that makes no.
Sense we actually have been working on a.
Crazy video it's about three months in.
The making.
Stop motion and it's for this right here.
For a ninja man for ninja mill yes i am.
Still doing this as well go to walmart.
Comm slash ninja mill i think i'm gonna.
Post that one next actually but anyway i.
Just made this video to update you guys.
Thank you to those of you that are still.
Here watching i have been very afraid to.
Release this video um i actually wanted.
To release it when i was gonna take the.
Break which was three months ago just.
Kept pushing it back and in the process.
I saw a lot of you got very frustrated.
And upset so i want to apologize for.
That but i yeah at the time i didn't.
Even know i was gonna take a break at.
The time i was gonna either take a break.
Or quit but i think i finally realized.
That now that i'm creating different.
Types of content that's not stuff that i.
Hate i don't need to quit i'm i feel.
Good i haven't felt this kind of freedom.
On this channel since the very beginning.
Of youtube i would have never posted.
This video of two years ago just me.
Talking that's not funny it's not.
Creative for those of you that are still.
Watching and are okay with that thank.
You so much because it trust me it kind.
Of brought me out of a little mini.
Depression and i don't use that word.
Lightly and i know it seems like i'm.
Just complaining about like minuscule.
Things there's a lot bigger problems in.
The world i know some people can't.
Afford to just because they hate their.
Job they can't just quit their job and.
Do something else you know like i get it.
But for anyone out there that is in a.
Scenario like this just know that.
There's a way to get out and you just.
Have to wait for the opportunity and not.
Be afraid it's like jumping into a cold.
Pool you know it.
Day i need a better quote when trying to.
Say is don't let fear stop you from.
Jumping into the pool does that make.
Sense you know cuz the pool would be.
Like the new direction that the analogy.
Is like cuz you're hot right and you.
Know the pool is nice and cold but it's.
Scary to jump into it that transition.
Moment is the scary part so that's the.
Fear that stops you let me rephrase.
Don't let fear i guess i guess the.
Difference in my scenario is some people.
Don't have the luxury of being able to.
Just jump into the pool because they.
Have other responsibilities maybe you.
Have a kid don't let fear stop you from.
Jumping into the pool unless you have a.
Kid to take care of bring the kid in the.
Pool with you but he may drown you.
Because you have to swim for you can.
Jump into the pool if you have really.
Good legs straight also depends.
Hollywood have to kick in the kids where.
The kid can stay in the sun suffering.
Push the kid into the shallow and don't.
Let fear of the kid drowning the kid is.
On the shallow end of the fear and kids.
Or don't have fear of just orb don't.
Jump don't keep you don't have kids is.
The lesson so what do you think yeah.
Think i'll keep editing the videos from.
Here.
