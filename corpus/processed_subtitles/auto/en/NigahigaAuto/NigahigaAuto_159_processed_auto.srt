So i know it's not in the title and i.
Haven't done it in a while but this is.
Pretty much an off the pill vide for.
Those of you that are new and don't know.
That series off the pill pretty much.
Means that i can get pregnant at any.
Time oh it means that i was diagnosed.
With adhd as a kid and off the pill it.
Means that i don't take my medication i.
Just turn on the camera and talk to it.
And just let my mind flutter it's the.
Best word i could come up with see i.
Need i need my medication hey guys so.
Today i'm gonna be talking about some.
Lessons that i learned this year but.
Before i get into it first of all let me.
Say that i'm sorry i haven't posted a.
Video in a couple weeks the video i'm.
Currently working on is taking a lot.
Longer than i thought and it's been.
Something i really wanted to do all year.
And just never had the time for it and i.
Still don't have the time for it that's.
Why i miss two weeks but it should be.
Done next week so i hope you guys.
Actually like it when it comes out may.
Not and i don't want to give away too.
Much but to get you guys excited here's.
A quick preview here there's gonna be a.
Character with two eyes in it for sure.
Alright i didn't show you guys what it.
Was about because i don't want to spoil.
It and also kind of because we don't.
Have that much done yet you know what is.
This look like a lizard but we just.
Finished filming so it should be done by.
Next week i'll be on the lookout for it.
Back to the top before i distract myself.
Again here's all the lessons i learned.
In 2013 for i thanks to vine i learned.
How every different ray's be like in.
Every case scenario another lesson i got.
From mine is that you can be racist as.
Long as it's funny and online why people.
Be like white people be like black.
People be like latin people be lying i'm.
All like hope still not gonna download.
It i always saw these kids doing the cup.
Song and i never know how to do it but.
Thanks to anna kendrick nailed it yes.
Twerking show me that if dance keeps.
Continuing down this row one day there's.
Still hope that i can be a dancer edm.
Music show me that lyrics don't matter.
Anymore    more sexual the better.
When it comes to getting views having.
Your shirt off in every single picture.
And flexing a little making it seem like.
You're not flexing does not make you a.
Douche it just makes you justin bieber.
Whenever anyone passes away it's sad but.
If you're a homeless guy and you pass.
Away from a drug overdose most people.
Are like good riddance aleb rity that.
Passes away from a drug overdose it's.
The saddest thing ever to be people.
Sympathize for you have an excuse your.
Celebrity no matter how successful.
Looking or how good of a person you are.
It doesn't matter every time you get.
Into a car you're risking your life.
Especially if your speed because cars.
Treat everyone the same they don't care.
Who you are they're all about equality.
They're not racist so stop racing them.
Nelson mandela passing away is such a.
Big event but i think people went a.
Little overboard with how sad they were.
About it i honestly think both cory and.
Paul's death was way more sin elson ben.
Tell ellipta he was 95 people shouldn't.
Be crying over him they should be.
Celebrating him i honestly didn't learn.
Anything from this one but i couldn't.
Not include it granted i bought a 5.
Taught me that the only thing better.
Than killing and stealing is killing and.
Stealing with your friends whatever a.
New iphone comes out you probably.
Shouldn't get it because before you know.
It next one's already here in robin.
Thicke song blurred lines the lyrics.
What rhymes with hug me taught me that.
If you don't have good lyrics to write.
For your next line just ask what's a.
Good joke to end this one with seriously.
I learned from laura that harmonies make.
Everything sound good.
Kanye west tommy and the rest of the.
World what it really means to be a.
Genius so you gotta be pretty clever and.
Genius to come up with such a catchy.
Ahead of the game name like north west.
Where your dog being the non genius that.
I am i probably would have came up with.
Something stupid and delayed like.
Southwest sorry southwest i genuinely.
Love youtube that youtube is always.
Teaching me things this year i learned.
That i should probably be into gaming.
Videos i also learned in your powerpoint.
Up you can do whatever you want no.
Matter what anyone says or thinks for.
Example this year when they integrated.
Google+.
So yeah hope you guys learn something.
Anyway on a serious note there's one.
Last thing i wanted to say in this forum.
Thank you to every single person that.
Subscribe to this channel we recently.
Just passed 11 million subscribers and i.
Know that may not be considered a lot.
Anymore especially when you compared to.
Someone like pewdiepie who has way more.
Than that just know that i genuinely.
100% appreciate each and every one of.
You that continue to watch and support.
And share my videos especially if you.
Made it this far into the video i know.
This one's not the most interesting one.
In the world no matter how much time.
Goes by its i'm always gonna appreciate.
You guys and thank you guys so much and.
Like i always say and i know it sounds.
Super cheesy but from the bottom of my.
Heart which is also the middle of my.
Ribcage to the top of my thoracic cavity.
Right underneath the clavicles on the.
Right side of my sternum right here in.
This general area thank you guys so much.
I know there's no way i can know all of.
You and i can't physically thank every.
Single one of you but you guys have done.
So much for me and i know i physically.
Can't give you guys anything so i'll.
Leave you with this one last thing one.
Last lizard neck.
Looks like we're evenly matched i'm not.
Even getting started.
