Hey guys so if you've been subscribed to.
My channel for a while you know that i.
Make a lot of commercial.
Or infomercial spoons and the reason for.
That is because i think so many of these.
Commercials are just so.
Irritating i mean they're already taking.
You away from whatever it is you're.
Watching and most of the time they're.
Not even entertaining commercials are a.
Bunch of lies the only time they tell.
The truth is at the very end of a.
Commercial when they're talking really.
Fast and you can't even understand them.
Anyway kind of like what i'm doing right.
Now i guess for example you know like at.
The end of a toy commercial for kids.
They're always like.
You mentioned in this commercial.
Satisfaction not guaranteed batteries.
Not included or like medicine.
Commercials they always have those quick.
Disclaimers that have all the side.
Effects of the medicine at the very end.
And sometimes it's even worse than what.
The medicine is supposed to cure.
You could bring this opportunity against.
Hiv stds or pimps if you experience.
Nausea heartburn and headaches vomiting.
Dizziness loss of sight diarrhea.
Gonorrhea sangria or even death contact.
Your doctor because he.
May not be right for you and we are not.
Liable batteries not included but more.
Than anything that i hate about.
Commercials is probably the subliminal.
Messaging in it you know like in every.
Shampoo commercial they use these.
Beautiful.
Perfect girls with flawless hair using.
Their products because they want to put.
In the back of your head that if you use.
Their product you'll end up looking like.
That i mean come on would you buy a.
Shampoo if the commercial look like this.
Hairball essences batteries not included.
Probably i'd probably still get that one.
But you get the point most commercials.
Are just not honest because this is what.
Commercials would really look like if.
They were.
Laughs.
What do you think he's on this time i.
Don't know shrooms.
Pepsis.
He drinks beer not because it tastes.
Good but because all his friends do he's.
Quick to make decisions.
That he would later regret he wakes up.
Like a new person.
That has a headache and nausea all day.
He is the most average man in the world.
I don't always drink beer but when i do.
I prefer not to.
Stay sober my friends.

Hello i'm the spokesperson for gecko.
Insurance or should i say spokes gecko.
I have nothing to do with car insurance.
A comedy for that matter in fact i think.
The only reason why i'm here is because.
The comedy name is similar to gekko.
Seems quite lazy if you ask me gekko in.
15 minutes you could spend 15 percent.
More time than we did writing this.
Commercial.
