Hey guys ah he'll start this over real.
Quick hey guys so by now i'm sure all of.
You have already heard about all the.
Drama and controversy around you know.
Steve harvey making the jokes called.
Asian man basically he made some jokes.
On this show about asian men and how.
They're not attractive and this is what.
It looked like you know thank you.
Obviously there was a lot of drama that.
Fall there was two different sides of.
People either you know attacking steve.
Harvey saying he's racist for making.
Those jokes or people actually defending.
Him and saying you know he's a comedian.
And asians need to learn to just take a.
Joke and even though i'm asian and i.
Should be biased when i really thought.
About it i wasn't personally offended by.
What he said i'm not saying what he said.
Was right i'm just saying for me.
Personally i don't get offended by.
Things like that i've been hearing it my.
Whole life.
Obviously i can see why agents were.
Offended and are upset about this and i.
Have to admit i was upset too but.
Probably for a completely different.
Reason i wasn't upset by the fact that.
He was saying asian men are unattractive.
I was upset for just two reasons first.
Of all the double standard that exists.
When it comes to making racist jokes.
It's like in our society's almost okay.
To make jokes about asians like this i.
Mean could you imagine if we switch the.
Rows and we have an asian man playing.
Steve harvey and said the things that he.
Said but about black people on national.
Television excuse me do you like black.
Men no thank you yeah i'm pretty sure.
That asian guy's career would be over.
Any probably getting death threats he'd.
Probably not be able to book another job.
There would be significantly more.
Outrage than there was about this steve.
Harvey thing but since the joke was.
About asians it's not as big of a deal.
Because you know it's just a joke i mean.
Asians are like the punch bags of.
Society i can understand if this was.
Like the first time that this ever.
Happened in mainstream media let's be.
Real these kinds of things happen to.
Asians all the time i mean remember.
During linsanity and espn wrote about.
Jeremy lin and they titled the article a.
In the armor obviously making.
Reference to the fact that jeremy is.
Asian and yes there was a lot of outrage.
For that i'm not denying that though.
Again there was no people with defending.
The fact that it was a joke but my point.
Is the fact that anybody would actually.
Think it's okay to title an article a.
In the armor when you know it's a.
Non comedic sports related article it's.
Kind of ridiculous i mean the word.
Is basically like the n-word for asian.
Do you think anybody would dare to.
Publish the article if they switch out.
The word    with the n-word of course.
Not because society and mainstream media.
Has taught us that it's not okay to make.
Black jokes but it is okay to make asian.
Joke steve harvey is a comedian it's his.
Job in fact if i had to list my favorite.
Black comedians you know from greatest.
To worse steve harvey wouldn't be the.
Last one no i'd probably start the top.
Of the list with like dave chappelle.
Eddie murphy wayne brady.
Hill in harness rock chris tucker ronald.
Glover bernie mac martin lauren tracy.
Morgan wanda sykes the entire wayans.
Family makes seven up yours guy orlando.
Jones animate the godom buying bill.
Cosby steve harvey and then bill cosby.
After the rape allegation so see steve.
Is still not at the bottom cap god i.
Mean let's be real the guy's funny thing.
When you got jokes that are straight.
Fire like this one.
Applause.
Music.
Applause.
This chinese food is often in another.
Language see so sometimes they pronounce.
Things differently and what seems what.
Steeps in.
Applause.
It's good job the funniest part to me is.
That you know as a comedian he didn't.
Just laugh at his own joke he was dying.
From his home job and look like it was.
The funniest joke he's ever told or her.
Then again maybe he wasn't even making a.
Joke i mean chinese food is hard to.
Pronounce it actually made me kind of.
Curious and i started thinking like what.
Would it be like to have someone like.
Steve harvey you know at a chinese.
Restaurant for lunch just says spring.
Rolls look at this one look at this one.
Swing some bum let the sweet in a sour.
Pork it's literally for english dumpling.
Speaking roasted duck i might have.
Actually said cohen correctly for know.
You're on the drink menu that says pepsi.
Any one thing in this entire country if.
You can't even pronounce those there's.
Nothing you can eat in this entire world.
By a world look like the entire.
Runner-up what yeah i can't eat anything.
From this planet let alone any other.
Planet in this entire runner-up are you.
Trying to say universe oh yeah my bad i.
Always mix universe and runner-up so i.
Guess we just won eat lunch then huh how.
About we just go to cook um right yeah.
Come    it's easy to pronounce so we.
Can go eat it could    if you want are.
You swearing at me right now with the.
Restaurant you know go    they have.
Like those the gravy mashed potatoes.
Corn you the big old bucket of a chick.
Fried chicken with the white and red.
Stripes and the picture of that old guy.
Calling now bernie sanders on it mean.
Kfc wow.
I cannot believe you just said that what.
You're the ones because i'm black you.
Assume i like kfc racist that was a.
Horrible steve harvey impression i know.
I apologize i know that wasn't a good.
Joke to end on either so i apologize for.
That to say but at least i admit when i.
Have bad jokes.
Music.
Well i should also say that steve.
Actually did apologize already goes a.
Typical pr apology that no every.
Celebrity does when they mess up and you.
Know he doesn't really mean it because.
You know when the backlash first started.
Coming he literally said this she kind.
Of beat me up on him in there right now.
For no reason but but anyway overall.
Either steve harvey was making a lame.
Tasteless overused joke that asians have.
Been hearing all their lives or he.
Actually meant what he said and he.
Really does believe that you know women.
Aren't attracted to asian males it's one.
Or the other and we all can agree that.
It was just a bad tasteless joke because.
We know he's not a racist i mean he just.
Had a meeting with the president of the.
United states so how can he be racist.
But all jokes aside i decided to.
Actually do my own research and see if.
You know maybe steve was onto something.
Maybe women don't like agent man so what.
I did is what any logical person on the.
Internet would do taking it to the.
Streets excuse me miss could ask you a.
Few questions it all in tech fine that's.
Gonna ask you a few simple questions my.
First question if you had to pick.
Between these two individuals who would.
You consider to be more attractive here.
Be probably be err be i'm gonna have to.
Go with b i would go would be what no.
Gave me in terms of attractiveness like.
Who would you i like the walking dead so.
B be yeah if you had to pick one of.
These two individuals who would you go.
On a date with a or p b i'm gonna have.
To go with b again of course b i love.
John cho i mean guess b which one would.
You consider to be sexier be alright b.
No bro b i guess you were to come across.
One of these next to people randomly on.
The street right now who are you most.
Likely to kiss hey hey for sure i'm.
Gonna have to go with a are you sure.
Yeah that's a definite a.
So yeah the findings were inconclusive.
Probably have to just try again another.
