Hey guys so i what does it look so.
Different in here huh anyway um hey guys.
So over the 10 - almost 11 years that.
I've been on youtube i've gotten to do a.
Lot of things that i never thought i'd.
Be able to do before and i'm sure if you.
Ask any other youtubers that have been.
Around for that amount of time and.
They'll agree with me when i say that.
People start treating you like you're.
Some kind of genius professional social.
Media expert and i'm sure it is true for.
A lot of those youtubers who actually do.
Consider themselves geniuses but for me.
Even after 10 years of doing this i.
Still don't think i know exactly what.
I'm doing i'm borderline dumb when it.
Comes to this stuff i just make the.
Videos that i like making and luckily.
People watch they don't have some genius.
Strategy or like expertise that i could.
Share with everyone which is why i bring.
This up i get asked all the time to.
Attend these like huge business.
Conferences and meetings where people.
Pretty much just asked for my expertise.
On social media and they treat me like.
I'm one of the all-knowing of social.
Media and to be honest when i go to.
These things i feel completely out of.
Place people that attend these things.
Are like millionaire billionaire and and.
Women that owned multiple businesses.
They're all taking notes and advice from.
This 26 year old college dropout with.
Stupid looking hair talk about youtube.
And and all the expertise and knowledge.
That i have to share with them i mean i.
Don't like to brag but i think i pretty.
Much killed it so tell us ryan how does.
One get started on youtube well you see.
You have to make an account by clicking.
The sign up button okay are there any.
Complications or problems that one might.
Run into when starting a channel and if.
So how do you solve them i mean.
Sometimes your user name can already be.
Taken so you solve that by adding like a.
Number to it or you could you know.
Change the letters like can we go e into.
It like a three like a backwards e.
Alright one last question how do you.
Come up with your ideas well ideas are.
Just thoughts and everyone has thoughts.
I mean i have thoughts right now this.
Meeting could be a video idea you know.
Like i could make literally this meeting.
A video well let's hope you don't do.
That because this is a very confidential.
Meeting i mean it's already happening.
What right in the video right now you.
Really can't do this too late this is.
Gonna be a video can and we will sue you.
If you make a video blog this event okay.
Sure.
Oh yeah that's why i have no stuff i'm.
Just plain but in all seriousness having.
To hang out with these uh maybe you will.
Call them.
Jewett's i started noticing some.
Patterns between them not just the.
Successful ones but more so with the.
Unsuccessful ones that are appearing to.
Be successful and today i'm gonna be.
Teaching you just that how to sound.
Smarter than you really are.
Music.
One of the easiest ways to appear.
Smarter than you really are is to dress.
The way they dress that you see if you.
Dress poorly you'll look stupid for.
Example if you dress like a hobo or like.
A poor person you'll never get any.
Respect and people will never think.
You're smart let me take a look at this.
Guy you think people actually think this.
Guy is smart and successful no or even.
If you wear like a plain shirt like this.
Guy you think anybody's gonna think.
You're smart dressed like that if you.
Want people to take you seriously if you.
Want people to think that you're smart.
You have to dress smart dress for.
Success and only then people believe.
That your genius like this pretty.
Self-explanatory.
Normal people like you and i have a.
Dictionary they have the thesaurus.
Some people just like to use words that.
People don't use as often for example if.
Someone's giving you the choice to pick.
Between two options rather than just.
Saying which option you want you say.
I'll take the ladder so which one would.
You like a or b no i'll take the ladder.
Uh but which one would you like the.
Ladder.
Oh the latter okay so you want the.
Second one no the ladders oh you want.
The first one just the ladders so you.
Want both of them oh my god i'm just.
Gonna get in myself in the ladders smart.
People always want to know what you do.
They always make their job sound way.
More important than it really is.
School janitor more like certified.
Educational hygienist cashier more like.
Financial training delivery operator.
Stripper more like prostitution oh.
Entertainer that does not engage in.
Sexual activity for money see any job.
Kim sound important even if you're not.
Employed right now its 2017 everybody is.
Working they think what did you say you.
Did again oh i am a freelance.
Independent entrepreneur a leader in.
Social media marketing and research.
Relations meaning you're unemployed and.
You post in read comments on facebook.
And twitter.
I see well congratulations you're.
Hired.
Really yeah you can start as early as.
This evening oh this is a night job what.
Exactly was my job title again oh well a.
Prostitution elendor tarrant that does.
Not engage in sexual activity for money.
Oh except - the latter part of the.
Latter part what is that it'll probably.
Have to engage.
Doesn't matter how smart you are if you.
Hang out with people smarter than you.
You're gonna be the dumb one but what's.
Simple just hang out with people less.
Intelligent than you you think you're.
The dumbest person out of everyone you.
Know then what you still have options.
Hey marley you want bread you want the.
Bread go get the real test to show that.
You're really smart art truly.
Intelligent people can see art in.
Everything no matter how hard it is to.
See for the rest of you dummies oh my.
God it's so beautiful it's a masterpiece.
How is this part of the art exhibit.
Don't you see this represents life life.
Itself look you start from nothing and.
You slowly make your way to the top for.
Only a moment before falling all the way.
Back down to nothing excuse me what are.
You doing wait are you guys looking for.
The art exhibit that's across the street.
I've come to find that this last one is.
A hundred percent accurate all smart.
People must talk about politics and if.
You're anything like me you probably.
Know very little to nothing about.
Politics so if you ever happen to get.
Caught in a discussion with a smart.
Person talking about politics just agree.
With them that way they'll just keep.
Talking again you won't have to what's.
The deal with that it's pretty crazy.
What you think right i'm sorry what you.
Know about trump and the wall between us.
And mexico what do you think about it.
Well i mean like clearly where it's.
Talked about all over on the news and.
Where all three of us are talking about.
It three guys at a table during the day.
So obviously yeah like a hundred percent.
Agree yep but yeah trump is doing a.
Great job a great job at being a.
Horrible for the economy just awful i.
Mean some people think he's actually.
Helped the economy since i became.
President right he's been awfully great.
He's a man that i just love but come on.
As a president he's killing it right now.
It's full successful men that i just.
Love love loving all of our.
International time to make fun of.
Because he's just so bad.
That's right it's a badass man that's.
Why i completely support that no.
Countries you know work with the other.
Guy that he was running against what i.
Support the guy he was running again.
You're talking about hillary clinton.
Exactly right.
Hillary clinton bill clinton's mother.
Sis bills and you know but obama though.
Right everybody loves him she's got my.
Boat locked in if you know what i mean.
But you do know that he's not gonna be.
In the next show in the next election.
Exactly what i was just about to say he.
Can't running he should not be running.
He's getting old he should be walking.
This is his final term he can't have a.
Third term exactly why he needs to ace.
It i mean he you know the final is.
Always worth more than the mid term yeah.
I can't really tell if you're joking or.
If you're just stupid i really just pull.
That off oh my god do you think he knew.
That was a letter mean i don't know but.
Again with all jokes aside it doesn't.
Matter if you talk about politics a lot.
Or if you use big words like the ladder.
Everybody's different who's to say.
What's considered smart and what isn't.
Yeah maybe you did grow up being a.
Straight-a student your whole life and.
You got a perfect sat score and maybe.
You did graduate from harvard and got a.
Phd and yes maybe you did start your own.
Billion-dollar company from scratch let.
Me ask you this do you know how to get.
Your hair to this color and how to.
Maintain it do you know how to cook and.
Prepare a three-course meal do you know.
How to change a tire or or fix a leaking.
Toilet or or write film and edit a video.
That's not too long and keeps the.
Viewers attention all the way to the end.
