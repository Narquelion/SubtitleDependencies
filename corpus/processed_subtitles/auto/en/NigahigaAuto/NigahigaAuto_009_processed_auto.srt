Hey guys sorry i have to posted a video.
Know what as you can see i'm in away.
Again and boy have i been having a ball.
This used to be bigger anyway i'm back.
And i just want to say welcome to the.
New year 2012 done dog dog.
Anyway it's finally 2012 and that dog.
Dog i just wanted to say i'm really.
Looking forward to the new year.
Dog dog you done yeah what are you doing.
You know like in the movies when.
Something bad is about to happen.
It goes dum dum dum uh what hello it's.
2012 the world is gonna end.
Oh no it's not yes it is the mine said.
So do you even know a mayan no do you.
Even know what a mine is some type of.
Cabbage i'm sick of people saying that.
2012 is the end of the world.
Specifically the people that say well.
The mayans said so that's all they talk.
Like this you probably don't even know a.
Lion and even if you did they're not.
Psychics they made a calendar i can do.
That.
My theory is this people they say the.
World is ending are they're depressed.
Because they've walked the world.
Generally go to i believe everything.
They hear and read on google or just a.
Prick because they want to scare people.
Into buying useless things for the end.
Of the world.
Fired up falling down earthquakes why.
Those pesky meteors keeping you up at.
Night well look no further lakes in 2012.
See if you rock on the end of the world.
Problems will be solved with a simple.
Price of $100,000 three diamonds and a.
Rock you can get the safety rock.
Earthquakes no problem thanks to the.
2012 sake you rotten you would never.
Call.
Mears keeping you up at night by - city.
Rocks and sleepin the zebra disgusting.
Comments like the same comments are.
Stupid throw city rocks at them so why.
Do you wait for call this number reports.
Too late and remember keep rockin this.
Plan okay so maybe there's nothing that.
Stupid but people really are selling.
Useless crap to people just because i.
Think the world isn't which brings me to.
My next point the next time someone.
Tells you that the world is anything.
Tell them okay in that case give me your.
Money your cat your dog your waffles.
Because you won't be needing that stuff.
Anyway right my point is that no one.
Knows what the world is gonna end no one.
Knows when your world is gonna end so.
Why worry about it that's why it's.
Cliche as it sounds you have to live.
Life to its fullest.
So have a wonderful 2012 you'll be.
Seeing more of me and i promise you i.
Will see you in 2013 are you sure about.
That or i'm making a song for you.
