First off sorry i didn't post the video.
Last week i was actually in australia.
And singapore for a couple weeks but.
Anyway i haven't done a rant in a very.
Long time i mean like a legit ran from.
Back in the day where i would just turn.
On the camera wake up try to figure out.
How i turned on the camera before waking.
Up you know what i mean just ranting in.
One spot with no cutaways but i didn't.
Say anything about tara ways hey bad.
Joke not a good start so back to the.
Topic last time in a rant about justin.
Bieber called bieber fever you was the.
Biggest thing in entertainment surely.
That should tell you how long ago that.
Was as i was basically talking about.
This innocent humble 16 year old.
Heartthrob however four years later you.
Say justin bieber and you definitely.
Don't think innocent humble 16 year old.
Heartthrob any more anyway even if you.
Couldn't care less about justin bieber.
We all know who he is and how he's been.
Getting into a lot of trouble from.
Vandalism to drugs and most recently a.
Little racism and for those of you that.
Might not know about a week ago there.
Was a video about justin bieber making a.
Black joke where he says the n-word and.
Pretty much everyone called him a racist.
And obviously he publicly apologized for.
It but then a few days later on another.
Video leads of him making another racist.
Comment this time in soft form if you.
Haven't seen that video it's basically.
15 year old justin bieber singing in.
Song one less lonely girl and instead of.
Girl uses the n-word and sings it over.
And over and just when you think it.
Couldn't get any worse he brings up the.
Kkk and if that first video wasn't.
Enough after the second one everyone is.
Calling him a racist he's been caught.
With drugs doing so many other stupid.
Things and now this i could easily pick.
The safe route and talk about how unfit.
He is to be a role model because.
Honestly i agree with that he should not.
Be a role model for kids but that would.
Be boring because everyone else is doing.
That right now or they're going to be.
For the next couple of weeks so if the.
Question is if justin bieber is racist i.
Can honestly say that i see both sides.
And i'm about to give you the side.
That's probably a little more unpopular.
Like i said i still don't think justin.
Bieber should be a role model for kids.
Not because he does drugs or does other.
Stupid things it's because he gets.
Caught doing this he can take all the.
Drugs and do all the stupid thing he.
Wants it's his life but he has so many.
Kids looking up to him he has a.
Responsibility to not let those things.
Get out but that's just my opinion.
And now because of those two leaked.
Videos everybody and their mothers are.
Saying that justin bieber is a racist.
And personally i really don't think he.
Is i'm sure a lot of other people would.
Agree with me too but they don't want to.
Say it because they don't want to sound.
Racist let me tell you why.
Both of these videos are of justin.
Bieber when he was 14 or 15 years old.
And as a teenager everybody says and.
Does stupid things i mean if you're in.
Your 20s and you can still see your.
Myspace i bet if you went back and read.
It you.
See how stupid you are you say things or.
Write things that you would never do now.
And if you're a teenager now you might.
Think that the things you're saying and.
Doing aren't stupid now but check your.
Facebook in five to ten years and i'm.
Pretty sure you're gonna think otherwise.
And i know a lot of people are gonna say.
That him being a kin at the time doesn't.
Make it any less racist i agree he.
Doesn't he said the n-word and some.
Pretty racist things that got out to the.
Public but like i said everyone does and.
Says regrettable things when they're.
Kids and even if you don't excuse him.
For his age and you still think he's a.
Racist as bad as it may sound it was.
Clearly not serious about what he was.
Saying i mean in the first video he was.
Literally making the joke jokes aren't.
Meant to be serious if you were black or.
A stand-up comedian that wasn't like and.
He said what he said people would just.
Let that slide it's just because he's.
Justin bieber a lot of people don't like.
Him so he's instantly a racist in the.
First video he was literally making a.
Joke it was a racist joke but still it.
Wasn't serious the second video is a.
Little edgier but it's still pretty.
Obvious that he was joking i mean he's.
Spoofing his own song while other people.
Are laughing with him it literally.
Looked like a video of a bunch of.
Friends goofing off together hanging out.
In a room privately i'm sure he never.
Meant that video to be seen or heard.
Ever just like the donald sterling.
Situation which brings up a good point.
There's a big difference between the.
Justin bieber situation and donald.
Sterling so yeah i do believe that.
Donald sterling is a racist because in.
His recording he says some things that.
Were clearly serious and not meant to be.
A joke or make people laugh but the.
Thing that makes him racist is that he.
Actually sees other ethnicities as.
Inferior to his own and he acts upon it.
See that's a real racist justin bieber.
Just said some racist things to make.
People laugh sure call him an idiot but.
He's not a racist there's no evidence of.
Him treating people differently because.
Of race even if sometimes he acts like.
An ask to fans or flight attendant so.
Seth rogen's because they're black he's.
An ass to everyone equally he's an equal.
Ass i mean look at his instagram he has.
Black friends i'm pretty sure if he.
Didn't like black people he would not be.
Friends with them so overall to wrap up.
No i do not think justin bieber should.
Be a role model for kids and in no way.
Am i defending him but he's not racist i.
Guess that is kind of different in him.
But i'm not defending him because i'm a.
Believer i just don't think it's right.
To be calling someone racist when.
They're not college i'm gonna race this.
Is a big deal in this day and age and.
You can't label someone a racist just.
Because of a couple of jokes they made.
Back when they were a kid i mean if you.
Can honestly say that you've never said.
Something as a kid that you wish you.
Didn't say and if you never repeated a.
Black joke or any racist joke that you.
Heard to a bunch of family and friends.
In a private location thinking no one.
Else would hear it congratulations you.
Literally might be the best person in.
The world the best person that i know at.
Least you should be the next justin.
Bieber the president the pole because.
You're pretty damn close to perfect and.
People should be following a role model.
Like you but then again if you really do.
Believe that you haven't done.
Wrong in your life and you think people.
Should follow what you do it's pretty.
Cocky of you to think that and now i.
Hate you see how that works and i'm.
Gonna say it again just because this.
Videos based on racism and i already.
Know the comments my last name is.
Okinawan so it's pronounced higa not.
Higa so it's pronounced nigahiga if.
You're interpreting it the other way.
That's because you're reading it wrong.
And that would make you a little racist.
But anyway thank you guys so much for.
Watching like i said this was my first.
Friend in a long time without any.
Cutaways though i did have a lot of.
Urges to do so especially on that one.
Part of the video where i said we don't.
Edits couldn't pass to everyone equally.
He's an equal apps so close.
This feels racist man know what you.
Can't get away with singing all of this.
You're not a stand-up comedian you're.
Not black and you don't have any black.
People in it yes there is you're in it.
Get in the very beginning remember first.
Off sorry i didn't post a video last.
Week i was actually in australia and.
Singapore for a couple weeks.
What up in the video see when i tell you.
Oh yeah.
