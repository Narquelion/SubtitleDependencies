Playing she's me anyway sean is visiting.
For a before everything what anyone gets.
Confused he's visiting for a few days.
Maybe like four or die's yeah sean's in.
Town and we had to have him on the.
Podcast cuz everybody's been asking oh.
Yeah so we have some of those questions.
From twitter at off the pill we're gonna.
Get through that later this is the part.
Where normally we're supposed to be.
Thinking our sponsors that we still.
Don't have so this could be you i don't.
Know i don't have any right there well.
That's not a road is not a sponsor yeah.
They sent us stuff.
Thank you very much road so companies.
This could be you i could wear your.
Stuff whoever's here could wear your.
Stuff good pitch that's it.
Yeah that's all anyway we it's like.
Ongoing joke but we really want it's.
Really comfortable yet no but rhoda sent.
This stuff that's not a real sponsor but.
They sent us free stuff.
Sorry it's been a while you know it's.
Been a while so shawn yeah dude it's.
Been uh he literally just got in so we.
Didn't really have that much time to.
Catch up i'm a little tired not gonna.
Lie.
Yeah i know you got got up pretty early.
How's life been this super general but.
That's blue like another one actually.
Yeah dude it's been crazy not what i.
Expected at all it's what were you.
Expecting to find a job for one oh.
Instantly right i didn't think it's.
Gonna be this hard.
Right right right well that's why you.
Were using this podcast see another.
Thing in sponsorships shot needs a job.
If you're in the sacramento area and.
You're looking for an engineer well i.
Don't know what if that's what you want.
But yeah we're looking for an engineer.
Yeah trying to do engineering but do all.
You engineers out there with engineering.
Degrees you might really do this but if.
You're in school right now get an.
Internship because that thing means a.
Lot when you were in school did you.
Actually think about that did you.
Actually like they had the option to.
Intern i did but i had a lot of smarter.
People with my class so they got the.
Internships i wasn't gonna get any you.
Actually tried though oh yeah i tried i.
See okay so it's really important.
Because from what you were telling me.
Like what were you saying about the.
Issues with that you need experience.
They arrived on experience but they.
Don't really they want to spend the.
Least amount of time to train you to get.
You a two-speed which makes sense for a.
Business aspect you know cuz they don't.
Want to spend a whole bunch of time.
Trying to teach you from the ground up.
Of right how to do stuff they want you.
To know kind of what the industry is.
Especially in your type of field right.
Cuz i mean so it's been like six months.
Yeah almost i think yeah i mean more.
Than i'm not sure it's about six months.
Yeah and you've been non-stop like.
Applying and reaching out to people and.
It always comes down to experience yeah.
And location - oh really because if i.
Was like in maybe like the one of the.
Main cities then i would have more.
Options to choose from more.
Opportunities more companies right.
Sacramento is kind of like a small kind.
Of town it's a city but not really a.
City it's more like a big town in my.
Opinion so well huh it's it's really.
Tough.
Do you think that um you know obviously.
I thought i won't point something you.
Said that you met a fan or something.
Like that and their mom kind of like you.
Hooked you up with an interview i.
Thought that was like you got a job or a.
See the thing that i run into a lot is.
That a lot of them like me as a person.
Right and they really enjoy like my.
Personality is what they tell me but i.
Don't have the experience to be able to.
You know hit it home with ya the.
Department's yeah because they're you.
Think it'd also be like wow this guy is.
Fresh out of college this fresh in his.
Mind he has interned for this company.
Why would they pick somebody who's not.
Exactly right so but the weird thing is.
Like if you can if you're open to doing.
An internship yeah like a non-paid one.
They're if they're not letting you do.
That then like how are you ever going to.
Experience you know i mean well they're.
For one there's a difference between.
Internships and volunteer tips are kind.
Of they're more kind of funded by like.
The government uh-huh.
So like there's a lot of legal stuff.
That kind of go into it so you need to.
Be part of school still taught it get an.
Internship and most places aren't as.
Open to giving volunteer opportunities.
Right so you know there's that old dude.
Yeah well i mean maybe like like i said.
That we should use this anyone in.
Sacramento or in the northern.
Californian sac because it would be nice.
In sac yeah sacramento i'll commute to.
San francisco two-hour drive but you.
Want to volunteer you know shawn needs.
An engineering job well i guess would.
You go back to like school since you.
Said internships are where you can go is.
That is that a potential possibility for.
You honestly yeah i've been considering.
It a lot if well right now i'm in the.
Process of maybe getting a job but think.
You're on a questionable just growing.
Yeah so i'm just hoping right but if it.
Doesn't fall it doesn't if it doesn't.
Work out then yeah i'm thinking about.
Going back to school okay well wouldn't.
It be really are you taking the same.
Classes like knock out change.
Oh i see okay just pull up your old.
Report from some yeah but it's like i.
Was thinking about going a different.
Route maybe huh because i don't know i.
Took i took mechanical engineering.
Because it's the most broad engineering.
Degree that.
You cover all bases of engineering to do.
Something more specific yeah i like i.
Like graphics okay it's kind of why i.
Was doing editing here yeah but i.
Enjoyed doing graphics and stuff so.
Thank you stuff you could use as say.
That's like experience i've been trying.
Right you could i've been crying that.
They do allow some to cross over from.
Like graphic design into cad designing.
Is what they call it uh-huh.
And it's just it's pretty similar except.
You need to know some technical fields.
About it you're like building like you.
Know little projects little mechanical.
Things or like architecture or that kind.
Of stuff so there is some crossover but.
They would rather you learn within the.
Industry right right right.
So it's a little tough so anyway your.
Advice to kids is yeah do the internship.
Get the internship because it makes a.
Big difference it makes a huge.
Difference okay well that's good to know.
It makes a really big difference no.
Matter what engineering you're in get an.
Internship mm-hmm but you are open to.
Volunteering free yeah exactly all right.
I don't see why people wouldn't want.
That though you know like it doesn't.
Harm them does it that's what i love you.
And that's what i think it might harm.
Because then he could be a potential.
Hindrance yeah because it's considered.
Volunteer work so you're not like oh i'm.
Like die hard for this company you know.
It's like i'm giving them my spare time.
I'm you know right so they want people.
They probably want people who are like.
Invested into it know that oh they want.
To be there there is a difference with.
Each company too though some are more.
Like family oriented were some are more.
Blue-collar you know and so like the.
Blue-collar ones just want experience.
Yeah where they're not gonna hook you up.
Yeah that one might be like oh he's just.
A cool guy.
Unless you have connections within the.
Company on it okay that's another thing.
If if you can make connections to that's.
Your another way in.
Oh hundred percent connections are.
Everything that's how like a lot of.
Things work nowadays yes even then.
Especially in like the entertainment.
Industry that is how it works yeah from.
What i hear at least like half the time.
You know we need to open casting calls.
For movies and stuff like that they.
Already know who they want they're just.
Doing it for the sake and they'll bring.
In like some asians and some color and.
You know just to say like oh we casted.
And this is just the best person but.
They already knew who they wanted hmm.
It's all about connections that's why.
It's important to.
Nice introvert extroverted person like.
Me i think you too actually i don't know.
If you're introverted i am i'm not good.
At networking i'm so introverted right.
Yeah right um i think i can.
I can't label myself as introvert.
Extrovert i think i'm a percentage.
Mm-hmm i think i'm like do both i think.
I'm like 35% extroverted and the rest is.
Introvert it's not like yeah one or the.
Other.
Yeah kind of like a cd it depends on the.
Situation and who i'm surrounded with.
Hmm see we're doing we're giving a.
Business class right now and see what.
You want to do is number one take the.
Internship number two be a little.
Extroverted learn how to network that is.
The most important getting connections.
And also make sure your tweets are very.
Clean go through your history clear out.
Everything that is a good that is.
Actually really true that'll ruin.
People's lives holidays yeah or private.
Your twitter right anything anything.
That's going online you just have to be.
More conscious like the whole receivers.
Are showing us yeah if he's seen this.
And you know dude i've been watching you.
You haven't had a job so what have you.
Been doing i mean i know you've been.
Applying a lot to different things.
What are you doing your spare time dude.
I just been applying and trying to.
Research no but aside from that i did.
Have like a little mini venture to japan.
Oh yeah which was very out of the blue.
And last minute yeah but we saw that.
That was with mari and am i saying that.
Was mario yes yeah we're a hella jealous.
When we saw that yeah it was cool boys.
Weren't that high but yeah finally were.
Like that no it was um.
We were like shawn to japan why no i was.
Like why am i here in the group you're.
With me like wangus and you're with uh.
Wes and mari i don't understand group if.
You guys don't know who those people are.
Marius formerly with james yeah right.
And then wes is part of the productions.
And wangus is like a manager he's kind.
Of like a manager slash.
He books people for stuff friends he.
Does a lot of this a lot it how was that.
It was cool mangas it was so weird cuz.
Why he's hitting me up like a week and a.
Half before it was going down and i just.
Like do you want to do this and i was.
Like yeah i have no money i need.
Something a little bit yeah buy you some.
More time yeah.
But it was it was like a they basically.
Wanted my technical aspect of opinion of.
What they're doing and that was the job.
I wasn't like a meeting greed no it.
Wasn't a meeting role it was over video.
Oh so um i just yeah are you allowed to.
Discuss it i can say okay i'm pretty.
Sure i mean i didn't need to post.
Anything but you sign an nda what is.
That good then i think you'd be fine no.
I think i'm fine.
Uh-huh but basically uh are you guys.
Familiar with sk too.
Just out of curiosity okay area ii south.
Korea it's it's a beauty brand like for.
Like skincare type of stuff i have heard.
Of that it's a very popular asian brand.
That's in singapore no japan maybe i.
Didn't hear about that okay go ahead.
Honestly i'm probably the worst person.
To speak about this sorry sk 2 but if.
You guys are watching you sorry but in.
Sponsors but yeah they were doing a.
Bunch of pops pop ups around around.
Everywhere and the whole the entire.
Thing was basically trying to have a.
More interactive environment while.
Learning about the product so they did.
This ar space artificial reality and.
Basically you take your phone and using.
The video it like replaces a lot of like.
The walls and stuff and like you see.
Like cool effects like coming out at the.
Walls or like you'll see bubbles popping.
Around everywhere so that's pretty cool.
And then like as you go and like it's.
Kind of like a fun experience like it's.
Kind of like a playground with your.
Phone and and that's what so what did.
You do they've basically just filmed me.
Mari and was just going through the.
Throughout the space and experience.
Everything every single room learning.
About what the whole product was about.
And then at the end they do like a.
Facial scan and it tells you like your.
Skin age.
Oh and then from that they'll recommend.
You like what product you should use.
Yeah that's kind of yeah so they wanted.
I guess they wanted people more in the.
Technical aspect i guess and to give our.
Thoughts about the space and what we.
Thought about it and give our feedback.
So that's all that really was they just.
Filmed this going through the space and.
Then you we gave our two cents of what.
We thought about that sounds like if i.
Were it's like a cool reason just a.
Excuse to go that's why i was like.
That's awesome you tear and why would.
They want me in there beautiful day.
That's why thanks that's why they hit up.
Only you wes and mari hit anybody else.
So you did that yeah you believe mean.
That as cool so that was like a very.
Short time yeah but help because i'm.
Jobless okay we're gonna keep bringing.
That up so that people really get across.
It let's get shawn a job please you know.
I need some help but like in like you.
Weren't i mean obviously you you want a.
Job but it ideally in engineering yeah i.
Just what you have interest in yeah i.
Mean i think this kind of plays back to.
Like the whole introvert extrovert thing.
Mmm-hmm the whole youtube life was like.
A little i don't know the i wouldn't say.
Demanding it was just very controversial.
For myself.
Mmm-hmm because you know we're like two.
Dudes from like a very small town in.
Hilo hawaii so out and you know me where.
I'm more introverted so are you mm-hm.
And the tension was kind of like a.
Stressful thing for me i can i can only.
Spend so much energy on it before i get.
Like stressed out about it yeah you know.
Yeah i have like capacity until i get.
Exhausted a lot i think a lot of.
Youtubers are like that and they have to.
And you see it too.
Yeah through their videos everyone goes.
Through those same phases like that.
Video i made about the life of a.
Youtuber and it's always like this hype.
And like you start blowing up and people.
Start surrounding you you move out to la.
And you get all this attention and then.
You get exhausted you say i'll have to.
Take a break i'm too late i'm too tired.
You come back once you find yourself.
Again and it's the same process and i.
Think that's what you're kind of talking.
About is like it yeah it does get.
Exhausting mm-hm.
Yeah and you were in it in the beginning.
Then you went to college so you kind of.
Were out of it yeah and then you came.
Back and start building up again yeah.
You went through it twice was my second.
Time going out yeah so for you then you.
Think this lifestyle fits you better.
Yeah and i think the biggest thing had.
To do with my girlfriend as well right.
Because you know i don't know if i.
Wanted i guess i was more questionable.
Questionable about if i really want to.
Be surrounded by this whole you two-bit.
Attention while i'm trying to build like.
A life right surrounding my girlfriend.
And stuff because it's very serious now.
Obviously i would mm-hmm dropped.
Everything and moved to her right and.
It's i don't know if it's a maturity.
Thing or maybe it's just like my own.
Personal quarrels of having all this.
Attention but i guess i don't like if i.
Have a family and stuff i don't want.
Them to know me as i don't want my kids.
To know me as the youtube guy i want to.
Do more in my life than just youtube.
Kind of thing yeah you know i mean it's.
Always gonna be around people are gonna.
Bring it up yet over time i feel like.
It'll chill yeah so and it just i think.
To put more context in it like you guys.
Have been together for like a little.
Over two years now right and for a lot.
Of it was long distance yeah long.
Distance is tough man and and so i mean.
There gets to a point where you're like.
That makes you feel like oh do i really.
Want to commit to this exactly what am i.
Willing to let go and in a way it was.
Like a burden off your back because like.
You said like you know you wanted to.
Build a life that isn't just viewed by.
Millions of people yeah.
And so and is where you're i like my.
Privacy too yeah you know i like having.
The split of a personal life and public.
Life so like you know i don't mind if.
Fans come up to me like ah i totally.
Enjoy just meeting fans in like being.
Appreciative that they've watched all of.
Our stuff and we're like longtime fans.
Like i still get approached to this day.
Especially in sacramento there's a lot.
Of fans at sacrament right but i do like.
Having my personal life that's like my.
My personal time my place to like you.
Know rejuvenate my brain and not be so.
Stressed out all the time i can just.
Enjoy my time with my girlfriend mm-hmm.
That sounds so boring.
Yeah it is.
Don't you know what that sounds like.
That's awesome yeah but it's it's more.
For my son that does fit you though.
That's like much more of like how i know.
You.
Yeah and kind of like to yourself for.
The most part very private yeah i guess.
I i guess you wouldn't like that to do.
That go out a lot and i guess it would.
Be kind of exhausting cuz i don't do it.
I just try and that's why i stay home.
All the time.
Mm-hmm that's why i'm not in la so okay.
Okay okay.
Cuz i want to know i wanna look this is.
Nice we're getting all like sentimental.
And everything make me smile and laugh i.
Wanna know what it's like a crazy fan.
Experience that you've had in your.
Career though cuz you're talking about.
Like you appreciate fans and you know.
Everybody that does appreciate their.
Fans but sometimes fans get a little too.
Crazy and they're just like oh i'm gonna.
Be best friends with this person and you.
Know that just just plays with that line.
Just a little too much.
What is yours mine okay - why was that.
Vidcon right after internet icon um a.
Lot of people don't know about internet.
Mike really loud or is it just my.
Headphones i think he just got louder i.
Think i got closer i told myself down.
But just a lot of a lot of a lot of.
People don't know but that's kind of how.
Ryan was more aware of me was this thing.
Called internet icon and it was right.
After that is that vidcon i was in the.
Bathroom peeing and there's nine urinals.
There right this guy comes up right next.
To me starts peeing looks at me so.
Casual it just goes oh you're paco right.
And i'm like yeah and then he looks down.
Tan and then back up at me and then just.
Goes cool dude and then just leaves and.
I was leaning you men there wash his.
Hands i don't know i was like what just.
Happened.
I think you just got assaulted by his.
Eyes like what do i do do i pee on him.
What happens i mean it's already rule.
Number one in a bathroom for guys yes.
You don't go to the urinal next to.
Someone else yeah unless it's there's no.
Other option was there was there there.
Was nine well yeah i was in the only one.
So that's already.
He's breaking rule number well.
Radio i mean like whoa you know i'm.
Gonna cut my stream i'm gonna cut my.
Stream and be like um dude this is like.
Danger danger zone i would be really.
Freaked out yeah it's so weird.
That's weird okay that just that as my.
Weird experience sex second one is he's.
Sparked a conversation wow.
Without peeing himself that is like ii.
Like the disapper everything looked at.
Me and then it's like cool dude it's.
Like just left and then he looked down.
At your peepee dude yeah that's really.
Really a stretch numbers dude that's i.
Was just like this is an interesting.
Okay i don't have a story like yeah.
Mines is not that bad go ahead the only.
One that i can really remember i was.
With you okay and the bay.
I think uh-huh and we're on one of those.
Tram things you know the public remember.
We're in san francisco you want the.
Large like moose heart things yeah yeah.
Run in the middle of the trolley.
Patrol the trolley yeah yeah we're on.
One of those things and basically these.
These two girls recognize this and.
Freaked out she screamed super loud that.
It made the train person stop mm-hmm and.
He came running over something like.
Thinking something was wrong and then.
The girls basically explained that oh my.
God they're like the youtube guys baba.
Yeah so he's like oh okay.
Weird i mean he kept going and then.
We're like let's get on let's get off on.
The next time this is kind of weird.
Because we're standing because it was a.
Fool like it was packed they're sitting.
Down right in front of us and we're.
Hanging on to the handles right above.
Them and just as we're about to get off.
The girl in front of me just grabs me.
And goes i love you so much and.
Something something something and but.
She grabbed on to me and wouldn't let me.
Go and it was like holding up everyone.
Huh and i was like i don't know how you.
Got i just feels like you just feel good.
Yeah i felt so awkward and everyone.
Staring and this girl's freaking out.
Grabbing on to me and i'm just like i.
Gotta go yeah just for watching nice.
Meeting you and it was just like super.
Ah yes.
Part especially in the beginning i was.
Years ago right yeah i was like 2010.
Maybe maybe or something it was a long.
Time ago when we weren't equipped to.
Deal with that before because at the.
Same time it's like this person you know.
It might be inappropriate to a certain.
Degree and but it's because they love.
You yeah and they really like you know.
You really appreciate that but it's it's.
Such a weird thing to have to deal with.
Like you have to be like kind of mean.
They're not mean there's like boundaries.
Yeah there's some boundaries that you.
Have to i mean it's better now.
Yeah people are older our fans at least.
But like when there's a young kid you.
Don't want to like break their hearts.
You know oh my god he's such an ass how.
He like pushed me away after i hugged.
Him for a minute yeah i got a similar.
Thing in town square where somebody was.
Hugging me and i got a little i wasn't.
Very happy it's just awkward you know.
It's just like you wouldn't go up to.
Someone you've never met and just hugged.
Them yeah even if you saw them or if you.
Saw like a you know like a celebrity.
Like um brad pitt you know and then you.
Just ran up there and start hugging him.
You would know not to do that but one.
But because you're a youtuber and it's.
Not the same thing as i think people see.
Us is more approachable and more oh.
They're relatable you know and the.
Community i know about their lives so.
I'm allowed to talk to them like you.
Wouldn't even like you wouldn't even.
Think twice like oh i love them let me.
Hug them yes i know you i'm a fan i.
Subscribed it to like a celeb mainstream.
Celebrity you would never i think people.
Might try that but most most times.
People would know like that's not the.
Really right thing to do.
Yeah and the weird thing too is like you.
May know them but they don't know you so.
It feels super awkward super strange and.
The crazy thing is that it's weird for.
Us as guys now can you imagine like what.
Is it like to be like a girl emails.
Right it must be so like like increment.
Like exponentially just so much more.
Strange i don't think guys would do that.
To a girl like they especially in this.
Day and age oh yes.
I don't think i've never seen what has.
Been done has it it has it like you know.
Like certain things like some guys just.
Don't have social cues sure act not even.
Just guys people don't have soules.
Recused at times and they just like.
Cross those lines and just make it super.
Weird like oh i paid for this.
Griet or i came to this like vidcon and.
I get to like you know interact with how.
I want to interact with these people.
That actually brings up a really that's.
A serious topic that i've been talking.
To uh not recently but we all talk about.
I guess a bunch of youtubers is how you.
Know if you have like a patreon or even.
A youtube channel where but someone.
Really supports you and there is like.
Somebody who's a little off i know david.
Was telling me and keena they have this.
One fan that felt like because she has a.
Because they have like a patreon or.
Whatever they donate they feel like they.
Own you a little bit and that's where.
You get the freaky people the people who.
Are like come to your shows and they.
Expect something yeah and you know those.
Are the super fans and it's scary like.
You don't know what they're gonna do if.
They feel like they're not getting if.
They can't have you then no one should.
Yeah and that's and like this is kind of.
Like a dark area to go into and i know.
You know i'm going yeah which is like.
The the christina grimmie thing yeah i.
Mean i don't want mean i was terrible.
That ruined me for awhile like i used to.
Do we used to go out to a lot i don't.
Know if before you around we used to go.
To a lot of events and stuff after that.
I just kind of stopped i was just like.
This is i don't feel safe anymore and.
Like i didn't it didn't feel real.
Because i thought okay that happens to.
Some celebrities very rarely but to a.
Youtuber or someone i met someone it's.
Just it felt so real and it scared me.
Honest i didn't want to do events or if.
I was gonna do it and they had to be.
Super secure i remember that yeah i'm we.
All i kind of like got pushed into.
Reality you know like holy moly there's.
Like actually some crazy people who.
Would actually do that yeah and to like.
Perfectly nice people you know like i.
Mean i don't know the backstory but i'd.
Only got to meet her once but from.
Everybody that i was like friends with.
And knew like they loved her yeah like.
Always spoke so highly of her and it's.
Just it's insane that people feel oh.
Because i am supporting you you're ma.
You're a piece of my property well i.
Don't know if that's the exact case and.
We mean the guy you know shot himself.
After that so we don't really know.
Exactly i mean i don't think we know.
Just from what i've heard yeah yeah it.
Was a fan nobody can have a crazy.
Scenario.
Um yeah i mean speaking of christina she.
Was just like there's a lot of youtubers.
That you meet and then used to feel like.
Okay they're very nice you don't know.
Enough about them but when you met.
Christina for the first time i remember.
First time i met her you just instantly.
Felt like she was genuine and that's.
Something you can't just like think you.
Kind of fake that yeah you know and.
That's why i was really it was tough for.
Me man i was even that closer i couldn't.
Imagine for her family or like other.
Youtubers actually were like close with.
Her but for me even just meeting her a.
Couple of times i was just like dan this.
I was i couldn't believe it yeah but um.
Yeah that got dark yeah super dark sure.
Thing is hello it brings up a good a.
Good point though about like you know i.
Think fans need to kind of realize that.
There is a crossing point that you don't.
Cross because we're still humans you.
Know like right you still kind of to.
Respect us as humans we're not just like.
Some like petting zoo or so there's an.
Argument for that too when i can.
Understand their side of it.
Not that it's their sides but people say.
Like you know when you're going into the.
Public domain like you have to it comes.
With the territory like there's a reason.
You're getting paid more to just do.
Events and stuff like that but even then.
I still think with that knowing that and.
I agree with that it comes with the.
Territory yeah it's still you got to be.
Respectful to people i think some people.
Just don't realize there's there's a.
Certain line like thing i hate the most.
And i always tell you guys his when you.
Know honestly i don't mind if they come.
Up and ask for a picture and i'll take.
It most times if not all the time i know.
Where this is going but um the only time.
I didn't and i was like kind of grouchy.
When i was at a buffet i was waiting.
Over an hour and i had just sat down i.
Was watching these people right looking.
Over at me i'm in line watching these.
People eat and like they have like i'm.
Just starving and i'm in this line for.
Like an hour as soon as i sit down i'm.
Finally like happy i'm like oh yes let's.
Go.
You know i'm about to get my food they.
Come and start talking to me they.
Approach me and it's like there's.
Another fan story i don't know i'm back.
Into it they start talking to me and.
They asked for a picture oh no no they.
Don't ask for a picture they just start.
And say oh cool and nice to meet you and.
Whatever they went back to their table i.
Go and get all my food i have like crap.
I have like stings like my hands are.
Messy all over my face and.
As they're leaving they walk on like hey.
Could we get a picture and i'm just like.
Um maybe like after i'm done you know.
And already i was just like i don't.
Really want to do this right now because.
For one i'm hungry too i look like a.
Mess and the oh we're actually going.
Right now i was like oh sorry and i felt.
So bad i still remember today this is.
Like years ago i felt so guilty because.
I saw their faces go from like oh we're.
Big fans said oh he's a jerk but that's.
The thing too you have to always be on -.
Yeah yeah and like the moment people.
Think like oh something's wrong with.
Ryan like he's he's not an    or.
He's tired or people don't assume you're.
Tired you don't know soon you're grouchy.
They don't assume you could have a death.
In the family that day and you go out.
And you say i don't want take pictures.
They're like okay he's an    yeah.
And they're not gonna give you call.
Because all they have is as reference is.
What you are in your videos yeah yeah.
Yeah and there have this expectation.
Exact um so i can't i understand that.
One of you but um i forgot what we were.
Talking about just like boundaries right.
Now just countries i guess cuz like i.
Don't know i don't know about you guys.
But i think it's kind of rude if.
Someone's made eating and you go and.
Interrupt them it is it is i feel like i.
Wouldn't do that.
Yeah but i mean generally but i guess.
Yeah i do understand that it comes with.
The territory but yeah come on let us.
Eat or he is hungry sacred place yeah if.
They're peeing in a urinal that's fine.
But eating yeah that's where you draw.
The line yeah come on in do not take a.
Picture take a picture it'll last longer.
But i did feel guilty for like years i.
Think i've been through that situation -.
Yeah i thought i felt guilty i don't.
Feel guilty but then it's like i'll.
Never feel hungry i know well the thing.
Is - i actually appreciate people coming.
Up and asking for pictures more than.
Just trying to snipe you from far oh.
Yeah actually while you're eating.
Because then you feel like man i got to.
Eat nice and like get stuff in my mouth.
When you see it - and it's like making i.
Go like one of those kind of phases like.
A side for people who just are listening.
I just made it really you know one of.
Those when you take a frame from a video.
And your eyes are like half open ones.
You know yeah and they post that stuff.
And i just like okay great yeah but.
Anyway i scared.
Someone doing that one time scared.
Someone doing what exactly they're.
Sniping from like afar yeah i knew.
They're doing it it was super obvious.
Uh-huh my entire family were like i.
Think they're trying to take a picture.
Of you i was like i know yes i do that.
What i ended up doing was i made a face.
To them a super ugly face i just like.
They freaked out and they dropped their.
Phone in their leg.
I like uh i think this is something that.
A roy or guava juice and then i think.
Also timothy delaghetto does they take.
Pictures of the people taking pictures.
Of them right i think i think that's.
Funny see that comes with a risk though.
Because what if they're not taking a.
Picture yeah and you're just that cocky.
Jerk who thinks everyone's take pictures.
Of them now you can tell everyone does.
Yeah yeah i know the people listening.
Won't be able to see this but people on.
Video do if you're trying to get a sneak.
Picture here's here's my advice don't do.
The little turtle t-rex arms yeah like.
Nobody holds their phone this close to.
Them and it doesn't help you get a.
Better picture the best thing you can do.
Is kind just like you know hold it like.
Just be natural yeah everyone does that.
The t-rex they make t-rex arms they.
Bring their phone super close like right.
In their chest it's so obvious yeah if.
You want picture for one just come up.
And ask yeah it's like when you're in.
That position.
You're never in that position in the.
First place so it's already like what is.
That weirdo doing oh they're taking a.
Picture you be surprised how many people.
Do so many people just the t-rex arm.
Just come up to us yeah we don't fight.
Except one we're eating don't t-rex all.
You want i don't want even mind that it.
Was just that one time.
You know i was jealous of them being.
Able to enjoy them you're angry i was.
Angry i was angry but yeah that um yeah.
I mean people gonna be like wow they.
Don't care but they don't love us they.
Don't care about their fans if they did.
I mean i remember posting what that girl.
That was hugging me for a long time i.
Tweeted it in that town square and i got.
So many angry fans i didn't realize that.
They felt that way like wow you don't.
Appreciate us oh i would love to people.
Coming up to hug me for minutes.
Yeah but the thing is they don't.
Understand how often it'll happen and.
How it can like interrupt in your life.
Cuz they're just like i want the.
Attention i want this but i don't want.
The negative parts of it you know i.
Don't want to have to like work super.
Hard and just to be able to like.
Get my stuff out there and express my.
Thoughts and everything i just want the.
Attention some people yeah i think most.
Of it like the most common thing now and.
Oh dude you can you can hear my passion.
Coming out i hear it i feel it yeah yeah.
I got passion in my pants yeah um.
They're teachers who asks kids now oh.
What do you want to be you know like.
Before used to be like oh astronaut.
Firefighter doctor mm-hmm one of the.
Most common things that kids want to be.
Now is a youtuber i've heard that yeah.
And it's just like it's it's so strange.
It makes sense yeah they're watching.
Yeah because they want like the.
Attention they want the fame they want.
All the all the good things about it but.
They don't see like how hard it takes to.
Get there yeah that's true yeah and like.
I think that's true for a lot of other.
Things to them yeah yeah yeah and they.
That's why they there it's a it's a new.
Field mm-hmm the whole entertainment and.
Like social media like influence or.
Whatever and people just like wow i see.
This person so much sure life must be so.
Good because you don't know everything.
That's going on you just instantly are.
Just like they must be like making.
Youtube money partying all the time.
Having so much fun doing all this stuff.
I want that mm-hmm you know and they.
They don't.
Again it's they don't understand or give.
You guys the benefit of the doubt like.
As human beings right how difficult it.
Can be i think it's a maturity thing to.
A lot of these kids are like you know.
They're kids they don't know the full.
Scope of being an adult.
Yeah i'm an adult yeah there's yeah.
There are people who are like you know.
Even our age i want to do youtube and.
Like you know they do think it is easier.
But most people no say most people think.
What we do is a lot easier than it.
Really is.
And they i think the reason why i mean.
You can see it in the comments and.
Someone like like lily right she said oh.
I'm taking a break or whatever instantly.
People were like oh you know why are you.
So another youtuber this depressed you.
Know i has meant to issues like they.
Were making jokes out of it yeah saying.
Like oh you know these guys are so.
Unappreciative they made so much money.
And they're getting all this fame like.
Oh life must be rough you know but like.
This brought me to the bite i thought.
About this a lot i don't even know if.
I've made a.
Brought it up but another perspective.
And might sound bad but it's your.
Podcast yes my haven't done one of those.
In a while.
It's my podcast i can do what i want i.
Something i thought about a lot and i.
Think you really don't realize it until.
You have it when i say that just because.
You have those things happiness doesn't.
Come from those things and it's on so.
Common that cabinets doesn't come from.
Money doesn't come from fame and you.
Don't really really believe it until you.
Have it yeah because i didn't i used to.
Think okay yeah i just want a family and.
Whatever but in the back your head.
You're like man if i had this much money.
I wouldn't be sad yeah he's fine like if.
I had this much fame like who cares if.
You know something happens i'm famous.
And rich you know like and you know you.
You really don't understand that it.
Really means nothing um the best way i.
Can describe it is like someone like.
Robin williams someone who everyone.
Loved right everybody loved he had it.
All he had money he had fame it's not.
His career was getting worse everybody.
He was a legend but he still you know.
Killed himself yeah and that just goes.
To show you it has nothing to do with.
That sure yes it does help to have money.
Right to do things i don't believe in.
The saying that money doesn't buy any.
Happiness yeah but until you have it you.
Realize it doesn't mean as much as it.
Nearly you would think at least yeah.
It's just coming from that perspective i.
Agree i mean i think that's like another.
Big reason why i kind of left the scene.
Right because it's for like you know.
Sanity mm-hmm if not like some people.
Can handle it.
Yeah people like me can't but it's also.
You know i always say to it's always.
Like the grass is greener yeah i know.
For a fact i wouldn't be happy doing a.
Nine-to-five clerk job it creatively at.
Least and so in that way i understand.
I'm still appreciative of you know what.
We have but at the same time sometimes i.
00.
00 and just focused on that time.
And not worry i wouldn't i could have my.
Nights and not worry about work.
I could have weekend's you know which i.
Don't have because i have to make my own.
Schedule when you're youtuber you are.
Your own boss basically so it's a little.
Tough mentally i don't know if all.
People are like this but i have issues.
Like taking breaks or taking day.
Or taking a vacation because i don't.
Even have fun doing it i'm thinking.
About other things and that it's a.
Blessing and a curse cuz you make your.
Own schedule so you can take those.
Things but like like i said it's a.
Mental i think in your situation it's a.
Curse a lot of the time could be we as a.
Group have seen like you know when.
You're just like like it's clear that.
You're definitely thinking about work.
And and when we're like doing other.
Things yeah unable to like just be in.
The moment yeah yeah it is like it is i.
Mean even people know people know does.
That about me but i am just always.
Trying to it's hard to just have fun.
When you know that you could be working.
If it was like a nine-to-five you know.
Okay five o'clock i can do whatever i.
00 the next day it's just a.
Mindset i know it's like a first-world.
Foot it is it does mess with people i.
Think a lot of people um any messes with.
Me a lot this is what i heard though.
Like when people say oh it's a first.
World problem but it's also like you're.
Listening to a podcast like you live in.
The first world most likely true sure.
Yeah that is true but i mean what that's.
Just i'm saying it in the meme sense.
It's not even like it's something you i.
If i really could mentally get over that.
Then it wouldn't be a big deal huh but.
It's just it just happens i think a lot.
Of like even like personal businesses.
Anybody who owns a business really can.
Yeah really relate to that.
It's all about balance yeah i mean.
That's like one of the biggest issues in.
Life is like work-life balance you know.
Yeah it's one of the heart i feel like.
That's like one of the most common like.
Problems in life especially like as you.
Get older and becoming an adult you know.
Like having that work-life balance like.
Really means a lot i mean that's what.
You're even that's the whole point of.
Why you moved and stuff like that yeah.
Yeah and it's important for people think.
About think about it cuz we're old now.
You know yeah before we could just like.
Think about let's just make a video i.
Don't know let's go to utah or let's do.
Whatever we want but now it's like no.
But if we go there we're gonna be tired.
When we come back this is a different.
Mindset i think and before we could do.
Like 24 hours a day working and yeah are.
Perfectly fine and we're cool we're cool.
With like sleeping a few hours so that.
We could play video games when we want.
And yeah that's basically that that.
Changed i can't do that anymore.
Yeah i'm not living that college life.
Anymore i know we're definitely getting.
Older yeah.
To segue even though we're getting older.
I believe that we're all still part of.
The nine year old army which is.
Basically pewdiepie's audience kind of.
Like we support is that a nine year.
That's is that's like that's what the.
Whole joke is like he's had several.
Different regimes of audiences and right.
Now i think it's like the nine year old.
Army and you were talking about memes.
Earlier and we do the collapse isn't you.
There's a huge just go subscribe to.
Pewdiepie kind of thing yeah but he is.
Doing a meme review with elon musk that.
Is crazy that is insane but at the same.
Time it makes so much sense right yeah.
For elon musk cuz he had he knows that's.
Like one of the big it's like going on.
An eighth like a late-night show yeah.
But bigger uh-huh because his show is so.
Big and with the whole him battling t.
Series things is it's just like building.
Even more yeah it makes more sense to go.
On that show than it would be to go on a.
Like a good morning show exactly yeah so.
It kind of does make sense but it is.
Crazy how this this janet this uh this.
This wave i guess is qi held mainstream.
It's becoming the new mainstream media.
It's finally branching on ya and that's.
Something also that i wanted to bring up.
Was the impact that social media has.
Because there are like traditional.
Mainstream mainstream media stars who.
Are very aware of the social media stars.
And i feel like when the social media.
Stars meet them and they find out like.
Oh the traditional person knows about me.
They're shocked right oh and it's like.
But you you have almost like a bigger.
Reach than they do a lot of the time and.
It's just like going to show um like i.
Think i think is something like shane.
Dawson's the minded jake paul yeah like.
His viewership was beating a bunch of.
Netflix original shows in terms of.
Viewership well for one i mean it's free.
Right yeah so not everyone has netflix i.
Think that's a big part of it too but.
Like a lot of television is free the.
Difference is is that when shane puts it.
Out you can notified for one and also.
You don't have to you can watch it when.
You want to watch it you don't have to.
00 p.m. or.
00 p.m. you just pull out your phone.
It's a new version of entertainment.
Mmm-hmm it's happening dude we've been.
Saying for a long time the internet was.
Gonna take over tv and it was always.
Kind of there and that was a joke that.
Killed the television but it really is.
Now mmm you know people like elon musk.
Are going on pewdiepie show you know you.
Know it's it's really changed a lot yeah.
All right just subscribe be to t-series.
Bother gets so much nine-year-old love.
The way that sounds we're mine.
A we cut that part out right now we're.
Leaving that ya know what you alright.
What else just how you did you watch the.
Super bowl you don't like football i did.
You wash it though not all those you go.
All the way through but i watched ya at.
Home.
It was own kind of you would have more.
Fun watching paint dry that's not true.
It was it was slow though yeah i watched.
You the first half and i was like i kind.
Of have an idea where this is gonna go.
I'm gonna check back in at 4th quarter.
Yeah i think it's part of it too it's.
Just like oh it's tom brady again yeah.
What else is new i mean i like the tom.
Brady and uh gronk instagram videos more.
Than the actual game that's true that's.
It's so funny see you know what i don't.
Understand i mean i watch football but.
Like i'm not super like serious like i'm.
You know 49ers fan so we're irrelevant.
But i always thought like i don't.
Understand why people hate tom brady so.
Much i mean i get the whole like.
Deflating ball things which from what i.
Hear at least they labeled him a cheater.
But even if it even if that's the case.
Him as a person he seems like a really.
Cool dude doesn't he yeah yeah very.
Family man disease sons yeah people will.
Still make fun of that seems like like a.
Nice dude he seemed that the guy you.
Invite to a party and he'd be like hey.
Can i help you guys clean up yeah that's.
The kind of guy like what should i bring.
Yeah mmm whereas some people some of the.
Football players they look like i want.
To make it all about me.
Mm-hmm they come into the party they.
Start dancing and get a whole circle.
Around them extroverts i don't know how.
But it's so it's so easy to hate on.
Somebody who's like that that's why and.
Successful yeah like everyone wants the.
Underdog to do better yeah and it's you.
Know but he was an underdog though yeah.
Well like team sports fandoms yeah yeah.
They're hard they're hardcore so it's.
True you know you're always gonna root.
For your team i'm just saying there's so.
Many like other people out there that.
Play sports that probably deserve more.
Hate for being like kind of a jerk but.
Like when you're a humble person i mean.
I think he's no i don't know well i.
Don't know him personally but he seems.
Like a nice dude like it just a clean.
Cool dude hey tom brady we don't know.
You but you should come on this podcast.
If we can figure out if you are not yeah.
Because he's definitely walk.
Oh yes ace social media influence you.
Know maybe his sons will find out about.
It after he kisses his dad by the way.
Ryan higa wants you to be on his podcast.
To kiss us yeah so we can have some of.
Your greatness mm-hmm that's right.
Wow okay well i mean i knew you weren't.
Into football i just was wondering i.
Watch did you dude you guys do anything.
Like goat uh no i watched on my own.
Do you like the commercials though yeah.
Some of them i was a little disappointed.
This year was yeah i didn't see too many.
This year there was a one with the.
Backstreet boys that was kind of funny.
Oh a chance yeah a chance to rap yeah.
Yeah yeah other than that i was just.
Like oh okay.
It's oh man it used to be very like yeah.
Every single one was like awesome and.
Now it's just like oh that was cool i.
Guess different i wonder if it's like.
The expectation because it's discrete.
Exactly oh last year's was good now they.
Have to top it yeah that's what i was.
Thinking too house like maybe we're have.
To high expectations yes it's hard to.
Beat and there's been a lot so you know.
How many new original commercials can.
You come up with yeah for sure yeah you.
Know what too though it's kind of like.
What we described youtube videos as like.
If you're always topping you topping.
Your previous video a certain point.
You're gonna plateau or people are gonna.
Get so accustomed to that so you do have.
To throw some like fillers out there's.
Some like you know you don't have to.
Always be topping yourself but come back.
With something some slow balls yeah like.
Yeah change and i would be pitching the.
Heaters gotta give them some change jobs.
Should we um i want to bring up the.
Questions that we asked people we.
Actually asked people did you see it the.
Tweet we sent out yeah bill antonov the.
Pill yep on twitter and we have an.
Instagram as well and we had people send.
In a bunch of their questions that they.
Had for you because yeah i was getting.
Tagged a lot i know you're the reason.
Why i mean they they have a lot of.
Questions so we're not gonna be able do.
All this i think i answered some already.
Though you did but we can there's so.
Many dude there's a lot of bad ones too.
So we could go into you guys want to.
Take the shishi break now and then go.
Into this yeah yeah yeah yeah okay.
So we're gonna take a quick shishu break.
We use that for those of you that don't.
Know this is where we could put in ad.
Break this could be you but instead.
We're gonna go a she she what do you do.
What are you doing i'm just showing them.
This could be you.
Oh that i mean road yeah like cuz well.
We're not gonna if there's a real you.
Know if there's another sponsor were not.
Gonna be wearing road yeah we're gonna.
Be wearing what they have or or i can.
Just read like a lot of people they read.
Like oh um yeah but let's show them we.
Can go above and beyond you're right you.
Know what like if for some reason.
Bananas like not even in just goodness.
Republic no just the fruit itself with.
Like hey we want to support you guys.
Will give you guys 10,000 bananas and.
We're like hell yeah and we substitute.
These mics for bananas yeah and you guys.
Won't have a good sound but your bananas.
Would be in there and then we'll eat.
Them and we'll wear them and we'll slide.
In them just like into your dms alright.
Now you're thinking now you're thinking.
I'm i'm there i we know she she break.
Yeah should we do it alright how do we.
Break into those again right back and.
We're back.
Hey that was a fast break they don't.
Know that at least for them they thought.
Unless if we had an ad there where it's.
Supposed to be but we don't have that i.
Pooped you did yep yeah we're actually.
You were just it sounds so immature we.
Were just talking about poopy.
No but we were saying how so shaun and i.
Used to wrestle and you know we had to.
Lose weight weight to cut weight all the.
Time pooping helps realistically it's.
Not not an immature thing is we had to.
Learn techniques to poop you dropped.
Weight when you poop yeah there's.
Certain ways that you and we found the.
Strats the strats to help us poop like.
One is like rubbing your your your.
Stomach was it clockwise helps a lot to.
Help things get moo-ving we could be.
Just making this up by the way but it.
For us it works yeah but the one that.
Nobody really can relate to that we used.
To do it.
We call it the bouncies and basically.
You just kind of get up and you have to.
Like completely relax your stomach relax.
Everything and just start like slowly.
Like bending your knee like just.
Bouncing and laying your stomach or how.
Do you describe it just let it drop dude.
Yeah and it works it makes you have to.
Poop yeah you know i don't know if.
People can relate to this i don't know.
If you're at home just try it give it a.
Shot no audience yeah i know no girls.
Can do it to they don't have to admit it.
But girls girls girls don't poop are you.
Sure yes heard that they might they.
Don't poop oh well the guys you guys.
Can't ride the girls eat you don't know.
The sensation didn't have butthole you.
Know what we're talking about though no.
Bouncing up and down to height like it.
Makes sense like if you think of like a.
Ketchup bottle but let's shake your body.
So it's you shake your body but you have.
To be super relaxed like you kind of.
Like after you bend your knees and like.
Yeah just bounce up and down real like.
Lightly but like why are we all doing it.
It's like we're trying to try it right.
Now describe it to people without having.
To show it if four people who are just.
Listen nobody's here describing it.
You're like doing it because you can't.
Do it if you're tense right yeah you.
Need to realize i bet you people.
Listening when you're describing two.
Motions they're doing it too if you.
Caught yourself doing yeah leave a.
Comment like driving their car to work.
Yeah they're stuck in traffic and they.
Got a poop and that's your fault and.
Your fault well it's actually hard to do.
Without when you're sitting it's way.
Easier to be standing i don't know man i.
Just had an experience getting off the.
Plane today yeah today you your.
Pants huh almost okay so what happened.
Was midway through the flight like you.
Know how when the ride gets bumpy you.
Like turn on the seatbelt light yep and.
You can they're like you have to stay.
Seated right yeah i had to poop right.
When that happened and because of the.
Turbulence was giving me the bouncies oh.
My god intentional bouncies and i was.

Read it okay a long best friendship with.
Ryan what was this like a long.
Friendship yeah they want to know how to.
Become best friend cross that line a.
Fanship and become french i don't know.
If that's why they're asking it's too.
Late i made it that question okay okay.
Well but we weren't like that's hard.
Fans know you're fans of each other.
Is pretty cool man did we did not say.
That there's no way all right what how.
Did how did it go down then well for one.
We have a interesting reading pass -.
Yeah.
Share it with the class well i mean just.
To start i mean i think our our.
Relationship is kind of like we could be.
Not friends for a long time or like not.
Not friends but we could not hang out.
For like years or talk or anything and.
Then once you see him when you're free -.
We'll hang out you know like just like.
Nothing ever happened and i feel like.
Some friendships work that way.
I don't know and some you just if you're.
If you're not talking to them like.
Consistently they just forget about you.
And you just never see them ever again i.
Think it's because like everyone kind of.
Has like a preference of what a.
Friendship should be like or if you know.
It's kind of like the love language.
Thing like you receive love and like.
Affection in different ways than other.
People i think for you and me it's we've.
Always had that friendship despite not.
Talking to each other and we're.
Perfectly fine with that.
Yeah and we still hold like a very deep.
Friendship mm-hmm despite everything we.
Don't need to talk to each other every.
Single week or like even every year yeah.
But we didn't talk for a long time even.
Even when you when you were in college.
And then you know it's like oh if you're.
Back home then we'll go hang out yeah it.
Was like nothing change and yeah yeah i.
Don't know what the secret to that is i.
Think it's just being both parties need.
To know like it's nothing personal you.
Know if we don't reach out you don't.
Have to reach out to somebody and check.
It check in on them like every single.
Like month just to maintain a friendship.
Yeah i think some people need to do that.
But i don't think we need i mean we.
Don't need yeah because we understand.
Like okay you're doing everything i'm.
Doing mind if you happen to be the same.
Town we're gonna hang out yeah and you.
Know with like social media and stuff.
Like you can look from afar and still.
Like give someone love yeah and still.
Respect them and still be friends with.
Them without having to call them up.
Every single day i was just talking to.
Paco about this i was like yeah dude.
Like i know i don't reach out to you all.
The time but just know that i'm always.
Watching from afar and i carry dude yeah.
I see his instagram likes and you know.
Watch my storm like my boy shawn yeah.
See but like that's some people actually.
Get offended yeah that stuff i know so i.
Think if you learn if both parties are.
Cool i think that's i guess the secret.
If both people are have a mutual.
Understanding like.
You don't need to check up every single.
Week yeah it's actually if you're not.
Like hanging out you know it's like.
Relationships you got to have that.
Mutual understanding you need to know.
How each other clicks and what like each.
Other likes and dislikes yeah everyone.
Is different i don't think there's a.
Real secret to behind it it just kind of.
Worked out with us yeah all right you.
Nerds the reason so shane won greg asked.
Um what's your favorite anime why are.
You doing like a x is that well because.
It's a favorite meme anime i don't care.
Okay i just want to know what your.
Favorite anime what's yours shawn.
Favorite anime it's got a mean art oh.
Yeah i would say of all time even though.
I don't know why no to get so much hate.
Oh sorry naruto you say it wrong they.
Make fun of you too yeah dude but anyway.
Yeah i would say that was probably like.
My favorite all over time yeah we're.
Just talking about this too about how.
Animes like i feel like kids should.
Watch them to grow up not to grow up wow.
They're growing up like we did i think.
It's not all animes especially the ones.
Like the ones that people hate on like.
Dbz or naruto or my hero like it's all.
All the protagonists the people that you.
Fall in love with the one that you're.
Following have really good morals like.
They're just good people.
Yeah i think also they have big flaws.
That are very very yeah and it shows.
Like oh you can overcome this time.
Exactly and that's what we're saying.
Like for naruto he's like this loser.
He's a kid who gets bullied no one in.
The town likes him that's what it starts.
Off and it really teaches you like man.
You got to work hard like the reason why.
You respect him is like man it's so.
Touching cuz he just keeps pushing he.
Pushes through you know and any has such.
This dark past and i think it's just it.
Would be good for kids yeah he makes the.
Most of it and he ends up becoming like.
A cool guy yeah i don't know spoilers.
Yeah.
Those been done alright yeah but hi i.
Like i like naruto they reflect a lot of.
Like real-life situations while you.
Canyon i don't really watch anime you.
Watch online i know i really want peace.
You guys'll i did watch a lot i like.
Read a lot of it and then you read manga.
You.
But it comes in like burst iii only.
Do it when i was like oh man this sounds.
So lame huh but i would uh the first.
Types of like manga and stuff or.
Japanese cartoons or whatever that i.
Would read was a lot of uh like harems.
Sad which is basically it's like one guy.
A lot of girls and they're all trying to.
Fight for his love they caught something.
Else like not porn.
No there's clothes on and stuff that's.
Hentai.
Oh and i was there but the reason why.
Hmm.
No but the reason why the reason why i.
Liked those is because i was like man i.
Never felt like that i want to feel like.
This guy yeah that's cool hey you know.
What at least you're being honest dude.
It's how she don't think of it like what.
Are some titles is there any famous ones.
Yeah there's like love hina which is a.
Huge one ichigo 100% oh isn't that a.
Strawberry but uh ichigo is not from.
Isn't that the the dude with the orange.
Hair bleach in that bleach no ichigo my.
Trip in i think it's different.
Oh i'm not too sure though i'm just.
Showing like how lame i am right now.
That's not that lame would you so many.
People relate to that yeah i don't know.
I think whoa come on let's just look at.
All the enemy out yeah there's a lot of.
Like i don't know like fantasies yeah.
You know fanservice oh yeah and service.
That's what i'm about up skirts no i'm.
Strong huh kind of you're into that real.
I was into it now i'm kind of like i.
Want to see dudes up skirts.
Yeah it's he's not even making a joke.
Yeah yeah it's just funny or damn whoa.
All right next question from john.
Kool-aid do you really listen to off the.
Pill podcast in your own time well me we.
Have to and this is funny that you.
Brought this up cuz shawna we didn't.
Think sean even heard one i've already.
Made some quotes in and i know sean.
Actually watches them because he has.
References in them that we did not.
Expect him to know yeah trying to grab.
Some sleeves it would.
That's a good saying yeah i like that.
Way i know it sound and it makes sense.
Yeah yeah and everybody's like oh this.
Podcast really grabs grabs my sleeves.
Doesn't quite work but it works yeah.
That means you don't like the podcast.
But you are quoting the podcast showing.
You listen to the podcast saying you.
Don't like the podcast go ahead grab.
Your collar get um that's events um yeah.
Up close in person oh i'm quoting we'll.
Get um do you have another one for sean.
No we don't need to go through all these.
There's a lot yeah there's a bunch.
I thought we only had one page but then.
This is do one more and then yeah it's.
More fun to just talk i want to see this.
I want to see this one what's that um.
Give it to me so it's cuz i'm conceited.
And i just want to know how do you feel.
About paco and rhpc not give okay so.
Joke somebody actually wrote that but.
Here so this is one doesn't one um.
Who's someone that you miss the most why.
And then the second question is why do.
You miss me the least cuz that's the.
Obvious answer you know no not.
Necessarily you don't think i'll miss.
You the least you should tell the people.
What you said to dana i think you went.
To papua jokes a lot clearly you know.
When we're not when we're off-camera he.
Jokes a lot so i'll come back to that i.
Just gotta say i just heard something.
Today that he said to dana yesterday.
That i was i was a little blown away.
About like damn you can't you could say.
It to one of us but you said that the.
Dana dude oh man.
Dana is someone who gets i think the.
Least amount of love who probably.
Deserves some of the most don't back.
Yourself i gotta say this because a lot.
Of people don't really know too much.
About dana today yeah i want to give her.
A hurt much deserved what robert have so.
Many years yeah props yeah yeah so.
That's actually one thing that she does.
She does a lot of props she does a lot.
Of set design costumes costumes she.
Finds places.
Works like hand-in-hand with greg.
They're in a relationship but also like.
You know exposed yeah but they they she.
Does so much for the group and anytime.
You're like wow look at the production.
Value of it if it's not editing it's.
Pretty much dana yeah if it's not.
Editing it's dana so i'm selling she's a.
Hands-on genius.
Oh yeah she saves me so much money yes i.
Don't have to buy things she makes them.
Can you make this and shake oh i don't.
Know but sure and she'll make it yeah.
And she saves me so much money maybe i.
Shouldn't be telling you her story but.
The first time that you're gonna lean on.
Yeah the first time she visited babies.
She was already helping yep yep she was.
Already helping you could tell when she.
Came into the company that there was a.
Shift in all of like a production value.
I think shawn what did you say when she.
Came in.
You're just like because you were doing.
A lot of the problems before yeah a lot.
Of it was me and like derek and greg.
Just running around trying to make do.
And i think like we used to buy a lot of.
Stuff yeah and like you know like i.
Remember.
Aquaman was like a big boy yeah it looks.
So i tried my best to like find all the.
Stuff that kind of relatively looked.
Like it but once dana was brought in.
Dude look though i mean you guys did a.
Great it was part of the joke you know.
To have it look kind of wack yeah but i.
Was tough though dana was good dana's.
Good all right set design like.
Everything just looks so like i like.
Pleasing to the eye yeah she helps a lot.
She graduated an interior design yeah.
Considering how much time turnaround.
Time if there was a lot more time they'd.
Be even better yeah but she doesn't in.
Like a boyar no no we're moving on we're.
Moving on we give her the processor it.
Was a funny i mean i was just kind of.
Shocked me too happened oh man basically.
So the will has a girlfriend named.
Monica wow and i she's been in videos.
She's been in videos and she was like a.
Gymnast and she liked models and stuff.
And she's like she's a pretty person and.
Someone asked oh why is monica in the.
Group and i was like oh monica can't be.
In the group you gotta be ugly to be in.
The group and i told it skipped my mind.
That dana was in hey dana was in it and.
She was right there next to me and she.
Turned around and went.
What did you say and i was like i was.
Like dana you're like a solid for people.
Like were like shocked but laughing but.
Like more shocked honey.
Yeah dana you could say it to us and.
Like call us a 1 and we'd be like okay.
It's a quick yeah but it's just nice.
People it's so dana's actually someone.
We can like she has thick skin she can.
Take jokes yeah like she's awesome.
Person and so today she like i was.
Asking her for help and then she's she's.
Like why would i help you you called me.
Up for and i was like that's a.
Compliment you're 3 at best but it.
Wasn't she wasn't laughing the same way.
And it was like oh wait she took that.
Kind of serious it was a little i walked.
I walked in on that part and i was like.
That's a little cringy dude it gets.
Worse but not because of me because of.
Someone else but we won't say it's it's.
It's you understand like this is a very.
Friendly place where we can we rag on.
Each other a lot yeah i i get it the.
Most so i'm able whoa yeah yeah we do we.
Do give it to you a lot but yeah only.
Because you i mean you set yourself up.
For that i'm okay with that.
I know it's part your comedy i know my.
Role yeah it is fun yeah it's fun for.
All of us but i think now everybody that.
Group kind of has that guy though yeah.
Yeah usually the loved one like in tv.
Shows and something i hope gets fragged.
On usually that's the character that.
People love mm-hmm but not at first.
Everyone's like oh it's so easy to hate.
Him and then after a while you're like.
Oh yeah guilty for hating on this person.
Yeah yeah but i'm like now i think i.
Like it more because i know how to fire.
Back you do oh yeah you do i've gotten a.
Lot better.
But before i think you were like that.
Guy and then sometimes you'd be like man.
I wish i was like the one who was like.
Not getting picked up no we talked about.
This yeah i was like dude that's you.
Don't realize you're getting the hooked.
Up roll bro like that's the one that.
People fall in love with you know that's.
The funny one you know you're getting.
The good joke.
I am i am i'm still single by the way.
But yeah i'm waiting for that okay well.
Um if you watch paco's video i've.
Watched all of them me too oh you watch.
All my videos well no the ones the.
Recent one why did you post more no i i.
Just posted one rosano i didn't watch.
The latest one but no to the.
Relationship ones yeah yeah.
And we basically lived it but yeah.
That's i kind of missed it that was like.
Right when i left yeah it was actually.
Right when you left yeah it's like six.
Months ago because yeah i just met her.
And then i left.
Oh yeah her like the first uh-huh two.
Times like maybe and then yeah yeah and.
Then that video came out yeah.
Long story short cuz it kind of there's.
No context really for people who don't.
Know i was recently in my first.
Relationship ever as a 27 year old and.
Then basically she wasn't the person.
That i found out to be found out that.
She had cheated on me don't say names.
Yeah i'm not of course i'm not gonna say.
Names oh you never know i don't want.
Dumbass no no no no but yes so then we i.
Broke it off with her and like it hurt.
Me a lot but it also taught me a lot and.
I just made a video about it i was very.
Introspective um and like sean sean said.
Earlier he's not someone who like goes.
Into it but he shows support from afar.
And like when i picked him up today from.
The airport it wasn't something that i.
Expected i don't ever expect any of my.
Friends to watch any of my videos but uh.
He was like washington yeah i didn't.
Expect that is good too that's a.
Surprise to me why it okay so when.
You're being serious and not being your.
Normal self we're never serious dude.
Then it's like okay this is concerning.
So of course we're gonna be there good.
You know but like if you're happy and.
Being you of course we're gonna pick on.
You like it's just a dynamic but.
Basically like it it showed me a lot.
Like help me grow as a person because i.
Was someone who was like oh love is such.
A beautiful thing like you know it's.
This fantasy and you should do.
Everything for it but that's not true.
Most first relationships are kind of.
Yeah that's what you expect yeah yeah.
And and you you kind of learn at.
While like oh you know not you're not.
Meant for everybody and everybody isn't.
Meant for you you shouldn't be you.
Should know what you deserve.
Mmm type of thing and you can you kind.
Of develop self-respect at that point.
Ya know what it is and you have to what.
I had a hard time realizing over over.
Time with different relationships oh.
Tell them not not every single there's.
No i mean i don't believe that there is.
A absolute perfect person for you.
Because even if you find your it you.
Know your soulmate or whatever if you.
Whoever you think that is the perfect.
Person they'd like all the things you.
Like whatever it is someone that matches.
Perfectly with you you're still gonna.
Have to work on it together because.
There's no perfect relationship yeah.
Yeah of course but you know it growing.
Up you always think oh i gonna i'm gonna.
Wait for that one yeah or you know.
Garvey's installation man movies man i.
Told you movies like ruin relationships.
For in the beginning yeah and then you.
Learn okay this let's be realistic yeah.
A good quote i heard was everyone's.
Looking for the right one but nobody.
Wants to be the right one who said that.
I don't know i just saw it that's like.
Something i don't know i don't know just.
Like that one dude who i was like makes.
Those videos matthew hussey yeah he.
Takes things and oh yes he has things.
That are like so deep and meaningful but.
I got like whoa you bow i bet you we.
Could make one right now yeah you know.
In life you got to be a piece of paper.
Ooh you're open to so many different.
Things it's not about what the paper is.
It's about what you write on the paper.
And tell your story on that paper don't.
Be a paper that's just you know i gotta.
Be an essay or i gotta be a math problem.
I gotta do whatever it just being up.
Just be a free paper and just flow just.
Be you at the same time paper wears.
Paper come from paper countries be one.
With the earth the organic be you be.
Genuine see we're making one right now.
Behavior yeah also what happens people.
Will be paper chasing so that's what you.
Want to be to people would chase you.
When they find out your true value yeah.
That's enough anyways.
Shawn you are in a relationship i'm not.
Saying you're a guru or anything but.
Like i guess because like we said.
Earlier long distances very difficult oh.
What is what are some things that are.
Tit on that what are some things that uh.
You feel like really helps i guess you.
Know that overcome difficulties like.
That communication communication and.
Mutual understanding is the biggest yeah.
So most important things it's simple but.
It's difficult yeah because you know you.
Need to be able to have an understanding.
Between both parties and understand what.
You want as part of the relationship and.
There's a lot of trust that comes behind.
It - mm-hmm because you know because.
You're long distance you don't know what.
They're doing on there and right they.
Don't know what you're doing so you have.
To build a lot of trust and a lot of.
Communication and be open to it i think.
Especially for guys were kind of like.
You know closed doors but that is true.
Actually that's another guys i think.
Majority men are typically more closed.
Off as like emotionally you know so i.
Think a big part especially for me i.
Don't know about other people but for my.
From my experience it was being able to.
Be completely open 100% to your.
Significant other yeah and being able.
Like even if there's problems there's.
Always gonna be problems but being able.
To come to a compromise and have an.
Understanding and build that trust.
Between both parties right because.
Without the trust and it's hope it's.
Hopeless.
Yeah you know cousin really like if.
There's no trust then why are you with.
This person exactly but that's how.
That's how it should be with or without.
The distance yeah you know so yeah.
That's good advice.
How about you advice wise yeah i mean i.
Would say in in addition to that just.
Like knowing that you don't need to.
Always be right it's a big deal to oh.
Tell them i mean it doesn't if you.
Really think about it and sometimes it.
Matters because it is what's right and.
Wrong if you come to that mutual.
Understanding it doesn't a lot of times.
I think fights happen and continue.
Happening for no reason until you really.
Realize why am i fighting and you.
Realize like oh it's just because i want.
To be right and.
My point but that doesn't matter if you.
Really care about the person you can get.
Over that yeah so i think for me that's.
Something i'd to learn and i think that.
Causes and solves a lot of problems and.
I want to add on to that a lot of times.
When there's problems they're in a.
Relationship people think it's oats me.
Versus the other person when that's not.
Necessarily the case.
It's like both people as a team against.
This problem and you have to work.
Together to figure out like oh how do we.
Solve this issue you know how do we.
Figure out how we both can win we're not.
I'm right you're wrong you serve me yeah.
That's everything that mentality is very.
Like toxic and unhealthy for a.
Relationship when you can figure out.
Like oh even just the wording of that.
Yeah yeah sorry go ahead.
You know i mean wording is huge yeah.
Everybody will pick at small things like.
I can't believe you said this certain.
Thing when it's like okay stop thinking.
So much about that both parties think.
About okay how how can i help us get.
Through this together.
Not even i we i mean you yeah yeah but.
Yeah you know you can yeah yeah but why.
You nitpicking me john why are you doing.
This well you said i when i said to be.
About us okay we just went super.
Misogynistic cuz we made the girls sound.
Like that well i thought you were still.
Being guys do you consider that to sound.
Like girls yeah alright time for peace.
Enos of the week guys last week yes so.
You guys shouldn't be making you can.
Make those voices you can make those.
Voices but it doesn't mean i'm being a.
Girl i'm just being a guy yeah it was.
Just a sean dee's coming out i'm sorry.
Yeah i know so that's um don't assume.
That that was a female voice okay yeah.
Don't and that was pc this of the week.
Now we're going back to pc ness of the.
Week i want to talk about this cuz this.
Is kind of big in hallways i know what.
You're gonna talk well obviously i told.
You about it right yeah.
I just knew so a a recent thing that.
Came up was a liam neeson was in being.
Interviewed and during his interview he.
Had talked about how a close friend of.
His was raped and just this is like.
Years of years ago decades ago or.
Something like that the interview just.
Happened yeah yeah and he talks about.
How he asked.
His friend like oh do you know who this.
Was what race was this person and she.
Said black so he essentially and i'm.
Paraphrasing a bunch of stuff but.
Essentially he went out and looked for.
Somebody of black color to attack and.
Like he wanted to kill them for like.
About a week and half i think it was.
More so he was looking for someone to.
Cause an altercation with him so he.
Could really he could react and and and.
He said in the interview right.
Specifically a black person yeah yeah.
And that's where all the controversy.
Came from yeah because if you were to.
Stop that story there which most.
Headlines deal we'll get into that more.
But go ahead but continuing the reason.
Why he was sharing this story and it's.
Basically after a week to week and a.
Half he realized like what am i doing.
Like this is this is dumb this is.
Foolish and he said he went on to say.
That he's ashamed that he thought like.
That that revenge is never the answer.
And that we should learn from this right.
But a lot of people wanted to skip that.
Part yeah skip that part.
Nitpick at certain things and just go.
Out to say like liam neeson his races.
Yeah because back in the day he wanted.
One black guy did something to his.
Friend and allegedly to allegedly yeah.
Yeah and he was so angry that he wanted.
To kill a random black guy yeah even.
Though that's not the full that's what.
The headline would read yeah right and.
Then i could see because even when i.
First heard that from you that story i.
Was just like good he's erased it like.
That that sounds it's the easiest thing.
To jump to yeah and then you hear the.
Rest of any like oh that's the context.
Yeah and it's like okay even if he.
Wasn't right he realized his wrong it's.
A long time ago for one not that that.
Changes anything but most people leave.
Off the other end of that yeah and you.
Immediately jump to it cuz even i was.
Like that i was like if you just read.
The the headline and you didn't read the.
Full thing or watch the video about it.
It's very i mean it's hard to back that.
Up yeah he wanted to kill a black guy.
It's true that's what he said.
But it didn't have it the context behind.
It and that's the part that i want that.
We want to talk about at least oh no.
What do you think about that.
This is my first time hearing all of.
This cuz i didn't actually watch the.
Interview but had some deep stuff first.
Of all props to him for even coming out.
With that that's like a tough thing to.
Do at this point of time right now like.
Peace enos you know yeah yeah so you got.
To get the men respect because he.
Realizes wrong see this and just even.
You saying that to if that was cut out.
From somebody they'd be like oh shawn's.
Racist too cuz he respects liam neeson.
For even though he's a racist and that's.
Like that's just how it spreads and you.
Know why couldn't win friend groups to.
They someone reads an article they might.
Not even read the with anything big hey.
You hear well liam neeson he hates black.
People yeah like that's kind of how.
People talk in headlines people talking.
Head it's so like social media-driven.
Because we're taught like you know.
That's what we need to grab people's.
Attentions right away that's why.
Thumbnails titles are like that and now.
Journalism is becoming like that because.
Journalism it you know is like hard to.
Maintain and get revenue you know so.
It's like oh how do we drive people to.
Us yeah you have to jump on it now we.
Have to get people like oh what is this.
Thing maybe the more fully explained in.
The article but very rarely do people.
Ever look deeper than the surface right.
Because there's so much stuff happen.
That's why they could they call things.
Fake fake news yeah it's not necessarily.
Fake it's just they're not showing the.
Whole story or they're shorting trying.
To push one side of it kinda and this is.
Kind of similar similar scenario to that.
Kid that kid that was wearing the mega.
Hat and i against that he was like looks.
Like he was standing on yeah in dude.
Yeah sorry are you an american holding.
His drum in you know whatever.
Yeah but then when and i thought the.
Same thing i like dan this kid i said.
The same thing i feel bad now he was.
Just like everyone else i get tricked i.
Was like dad i this kid deserves a look.
At his fate i want to punch him in his.
Face and then i watched the full video.
And i like because i was told like this.
Oh this is not the full story and i saw.
His interview after that um he's.
Standing there in a group of people.
Right there doing their own like school.
Chants or whatever like that and this.
This native american dude starts.
Pounding his drum peacefully like.
Nothing he's but he walks up to him and.
The kid doesn't move he doesn't go you.
Know he doesn't move anywhere he stays.
There and then we see him smiling right.
And i saw the interview of this kid and.
He seems like this shy like obviously.
People are already gonna in psych him.
Because he's a trump supporter yeah.
Or his parents or whatever but he did.
Not get in this guy's face like they.
Made the video look yeah and coming from.
His perspective he said what could i.
Have done if i walked away i'm.
Disrespecting him i think is mr.
Phillips or something i don't remember.
His name is if i if i don't smile that.
Looks like i'm trying to intimidate him.
If and keep in mind this is in the.
Middle of he's a 16 year old kid yeah.
This guy starts beating this drum in.
Your face you know that's kind of that's.
Way more aggressive than somebody just.
Walking up to you and smiling there's.
There's so much like i didn't even know.
All that i was like oh snap another.
Races kid yeah and i didn't i didn't.
Like him yeah i just judged him and i.
Was wrong yeah i don't think not that i.
Doesn't matter if he's a trump supporter.
Or not he did not do what people thought.
He did yeah and like the headlines wrote.
Kid arrogant kid intimidates whatever.
Whatever and that happened like what a.
Week two weeks ago i don't remember it.
Wasn't that long it's very recent and.
Now we're on these like liam neeson.
Exact there's so much stunning uh i.
Believe like maybe within this week yeah.
Having this week yes like this past.
Weekend that the article might have went.
Out um but for so much information to be.
Constantly just thrown out there and.
People still have lies people still have.
To work you know have a social life.
Interact with friends how are you.
Supposed to be able to digest everything.
Fully and get like the facts from both.
Sides before making a decision.
Everyone is just so will so willingly to.
Just believe what they want because they.
Want to be like oh this is my side you.
Know i'm either a democrat or a.
Republican you know and this is what i'm.
Just gonna believe right and i'm just.
Gonna voice my opinion and support what.
I think yeah i mean that's i mean that i.
Know a lot of my friends like that it's.
Nothing against them that's just how.
We're how the media is has made us yeah.
I think yeah i mean i think that's a big.
Part of it i mean how do you how do you.
Feel about the whole scenario i mean i.
Know you just heard about the eocene.
Thing but you know what we're talking.
About dude i have mixed feelings about.
All of social media at this point like.
Marketing strategies and stuff it's very.
Uh i don't know what's the right word.
For it it's very uh like brainwashing.
Cents or they make you focus on certain.
Aspects without giving the giving you.
The full context and that was like the.
Whole like political thing to you know.
Like you know you can take snip like how.
Much can you fully understand the full.
Context of it if they're giving you like.
A ten second video mmm versus seeing.
Everything that happen from beginning to.
End and it's like the same thing with.
Like you know anything controversial.
When it comes to like police videos or.
You know political stuff peace enos like.
Everything has context behind it yeah.
But people like you said people aren't.
Willing to nobody wants to have that.
Open conversation yeah and it's so.
Mind-boggling how people are just like.
This is my view this is my view blah.
Blah blah blah blah blah and then when.
Someone else is like well this is my.
View you're like no shut up you're wrong.
You're wrong i don't want to hear you.
You know yeah close you get just call it.
Close-minded you get called things to.
Instantly they people love to label yeah.
Just like oh you know just like i said.
It's the holy omniscient thing it's like.
We're not i mean we you know since we.
Are defending him because we're.
Defending him in in that not necessarily.
Him that we're defending that it was.
Told in a not inappropriately but it.
Wasn't told there's like misleading it.
Was misleading yes what it was and was.
What we're not known we're not defending.
His action we aren't no don't get us.
Wrong yes what he did before was and i.
Even and he agrees wrong is what i think.
What we're more saying is that there.
Needs to be a better conversation a more.
Open conversation about this or before.
We jumping on people and calling.
Labeling them racist which is a very.
Serious thing yeah like people are so.
Easy like they use that word like it's.
Nothing now it's it's it's actually.
Lessening the word it harms people who.
Are affected by racism yeah because it.
Means almost nothing now yeah it sounds.
Bad they're gonna take that clip and say.
Ryan higa says racism means nothing.
Right but you know i mean that's that's.
The thing though it's i think it's we're.
So close to labeling people and i'm not.
Close to where it's so easy to label.
People with in this day and age and.
People do it all the time and i think.
Before we do that we should really get.
Our facts straight.
Yeah yeah and including me because i.
Felt like i said i fell for the same.
Thing twice same here and i just wanna.
They're there were actually people who.
Were talking on this article a little.
Bit more deeper and one of them was an.
English footballer.
Or you know for soccer player.
John barnes who more in detail talks.
About it on a news interview and like.
The way that he presented it was like so.
Much more insightful you know and it.
Really drew to like let's have this.
Conversation even even terry crews right.
Who was like let's let's you know cuz.
Black people were attacking him yeah.
Like oh terry crews like you know you're.
Gonna get canceled you're not on our.
Side but all this stuff but terry crews.
Was saying like i'm not condoning his.
Actions he's describing a situation so.
What do we do.
He wasn't saying like let's do this you.
Know he wasn't trying to say like oh i i.
Have the plan for everything.
He was asking his fellow people like.
What do we do about this in let's have a.
Conversation yeah let's figure this out.
What's the answer and so many people are.
Just like oh you don't have the answers.
You're wrong you don't have the answers.
That i want you're wrong that's just how.
It is that's how it is nowadays it's.
Especially once you pick a side yeah i.
Mean i'm trying to find a relatable.
Scenario where once you feel like you're.
On one side you hear things differently.
Oh wait say you're mgk fan or eminem fan.
Right you're naturally gonna be biased.
Oh yeah and you don't you know that why.
Can't we just see it think see things.
We're saying why can't we see things.
From both sides and it makes sense.
Everybody has a bias and i think they're.
People need to be people need to at.
Least acknowledge that they have a bias.
So that i think that alone will help.
Them realize like am i being biased or.
Is this actually a hundred percent.
Believe in this yeah yeah i think that.
Might help and it's also it's easier.
It's easier to just like be honest i did.
Not listen true i think that's a huge.
Thing a lot of people just like yes so.
Much easy especially the popular side.
Yeah yeah it would be so much easier to.
Be like you know what he was wrong.
That's not giving the better let's jump.
On the bandwagon boycott his movie yeah.
Even though like like i said we're not.
Defending his actions we are defending.
How he was portrayed i think in yeah and.
I think that's what people are trying to.
Say yeah.
Same with that like that magga had kid.
It doesn't mean we support trump but i.
Mean if you do great if you don't.
Whatever you shouldn't have to you know.
That's that's all aside that politically.
That has nothing to do with it.
This kid who i mean really they'd.
Screwed him yeah he's just getting death.
Threats and stuff like that and the.
Narrative was completely false from what.
I seen the videos that were cut out and.
On the news channel and stuff like that.
It's dissimilar it's a similar situation.
Yeah and i think in the same essence of.
Like look if we're wrong if what we're.
Saying is incorrect have that.
Conversation you know yeah like we're.
Not saying oh like like you know that's.
Why i like the comments that we have.
Yeah i've had lately where people are.
Addressing things that we're talking.
About like neo incest thing like how you.
Know the last the one with davey we're.
Talking about how the last episode how.
Oh you know why at what point does that.
Stop being you know because of the whole.
Peace enos there yeah at what point.
Maybe in the future it'll be acceptable.
And people gave their opinions and.
Saying why we're wrong and i we'd read.
Them and we appreciate that like there's.
No right like just talk talk have a cup.
Like sean said have communication that's.
Why i was gonna relate the relation.
Right you know yeah well they work.
Together yeah it doesn't have to be just.
Cuz someone has an opinion.
You know how was yelling at them and.
Change it how does insulting them help.
Them that's my strategy i mean that i'm.
Thinking about if the democrats really.
Wanted to change or really want to do.
Something about trump why keep insulting.
Him it's clearly like they say oh he's a.
Child he acts like a child you know he's.
The whole government shut down he's.
Acting like a child.
Just cuz he's not getting his way why.
Are you insulting the child why are you.
Like why would you do that that's not.
Gonna work why don't you try to befriend.
The child say you know what that's a.
Smart decision but here's some.
Alternatives yeah i don't think he'd be.
More open to with his ego more open to.
Hearing that and then just being yelled.
At like why would he change that's how.
Everybody is to you know if you like.
More positive you work with them yeah.
They're more likely to listen to you.
Exactly yep and it just so happens he's.
The one in power yeah so even more so.
Why don't you just you know it's clearly.
Not working yeah i just trying to fight.
Him so why not i mean i don't know.
Enough i'm not smart enough but i know.
Why it's just why i don't see why it.
Does someone didn't take that strategy.
Like say what if this whole time kanye.
Was actually a democrat and he's just in.
Like sucking up and it's just like i.
Can't do it kanye but he's like hey.
Donald you know like i'm all for you.
Like ass.
Port you your smart guy you're awesome.
And you don't trip he loves him yes he.
Because kanye loves loves him what if.
Kanye was just like a democrat this.
Whole time.
Secretive right and it's all part of the.
Plan and he's like you know what this.
Whole government shutdown thing like you.
Know what let them have the win like.
Just you know i mean it's not a big deal.
Like the wall like we could build the.
Wall we don't absolutely make it that.
Big like it let's just let's talk about.
It he would listen to kanye more than he.
Would listen to someone on the other.
Someone yelling very sure yeah yeah i.
Don't know enough actually i'm not that.
Sure but doesn't that sound more.
Appealing don't you think someone like.
How far these from what we see doctrines.
Would be don't you think that's more.
Appealing at least to somebody who they.
Consider a kid i think that relates to.
Like all problems in our lives when.
Dealing with someone else you just got.
To be open-minded and you know yeah just.
Like a relationship come to a compromise.
Yeah right because come on.
Are we really right or or wrong mm-hm.
And if you're trying to fight so hard.
For your side like are you really.
Helping you them and everyone else has.
Surrounded or are you interested or are.
You just fighting for one side because.
You want to be right like we said yeah.
You know and then it all comes back to.
Relationships and so ultimately you've.
Got to subscribe to pewdiepie yeah and.
You said t-series i said the bt so i was.
Like oh you're about to get.
Nine-year-old hate oh anyway.
Shoot how do we get on that i just want.
That we're talking about peace enos.
That's what that's right dude that's the.
First time you said how did we get here.
No thank you.
No a second time right i was like i was.
Less lost today yeah the other time i.
Didn't realize until i watched the.
Podcast back i was like i say that a lot.
But i really was lost every single time.
And i didn't realize i was saying that.
Anyway how do we get here dude we've.
Been going for a bit yeah it's been it's.
Been about an hour and should i say.
Anything else you guys want to bring up.
I mean i'm sean's here for a little bit.
We could do another one honestly but.
I'll do the second one i know maybe i.
Don't this is fun this is yeah i like.
This one a lot of people are like oh.
Don't agro bob.
Politics and who cares yeah it's my.
Pocket i don't know i don't either but.
I'm still most knowledgeable about it.
But yeah but we acknowledge that yeah.
And also i think it's like there's no.
We're giving our outside perspective i.
Think most people don't know a lot about.
Politics hmm a lot of people know stuff.
And pretend to know more than they do.
But really they're just watching.
Facebook videos they're regurgitating.
Information they've heard exactly but.
They only watch one side yeah most.
People only watch one side yeah you know.
Head coach you need to be open-minded i.
Think i think we're gonna buy so cuz.
We're raised in hawaii we're we're.
Experienced us yeah you're kind of.
Forced to be open-minded yeah.
And you and well-poised super laugh -.
Isn't it that's what i've heard yeah.
Yeah i pretty sure it is i think what.
The culture like because we had to grow.
Up with a lot of cultures and accept.
Other stuff yeah look i i'd say we're a.
Little more open-minded to a lot more.
Things annyeong well at least for us our.
Group at least very different i don't.
Know about everyone but at least i know.
Between us 3 like we're a lot more.
Open-minded than mmm yep jumping on.
Dangled and like it's like super quick i.
Would agree.
I would agree so do you hear um sean's.
