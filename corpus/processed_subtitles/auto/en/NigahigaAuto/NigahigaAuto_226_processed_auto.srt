As nuts yeah and so yeah that's what my.
Co-workers nice well it was on that one.
Yeah you had to get it read where were.
You i was filming it oh no no i like i.
Like we grew up doing that stuff like i.
Got parents whenever home so we always.
Like did like really violent wrestling.
Matches and as we got older and like the.
More stuff we did like everyone wants it.
Atop each other so it got really out of.
Hand and really violent.
What's the craziest thing you've done.
What is it that well you have those.
Wrestling matches are pretty full-on.
Yeah like it's like yeah you guys are.
Like like big jackass basically yeah.
Jack astor's but like a driver rights.
Groups and stuff like that i love doing.
Practical stunts i could say you were.
Saying your your you know lay rate how.
Long how long have you been here i've.
Been here for like two and a half months.
That's it talk about what you working on.
Here yeah yeah i wrote a horror film.
Cool talk to me so i came out to la to.
Try and shop it and we got a big bite as.
Well saying earlier okay and so we've.
Got like a really amazing producer just.
Signed on then a bunch of companies have.
Signed on so like we're gonna announce.
It soon are you at this are you at the.
Stages of like already like it's gonna.
Happen yeah it's like they're.
Contracting it right now so i guess if.
Like the contracting fall through then.
It won't happen but apart from that yeah.
Looks like it's your first script you.
Sold yes first trick yeah it's the first.
Time that we like properly finished and.
Tried to sell yeah it's your first one.
In your soda that's amazing yeah you.
Know but like that's super uncommon.
Really yeah isn't it to sell your first.
Script that's pretty absolutely yeah.
Absolutely.
That's so crazy like we sold a tv show.
Back in australia and then our um the.
Network that purchased that just didn't.
Like do anything with it like we've.
Finished it we had like the bible in the.
Pilot that like yep we're gonna finance.
It and then i was like i get one can we.
Write the second episode and it was just.
The thing where we never heard from them.
Mmm so i think they bought it just to.
Have it and not do it or something oh.
That's weird.
Yeah it was really trash yeah well i.
Mean you guys do a lot of like you've.
Other than the crazy things you guys do.
Like crazy effects and you do a lot of.
Like scripted material and yeah are you.
The editor or yes i like irons yes me my.
Brother say i'll like think of what the.
Idea is usually in a more like.
Improvised on set or have a script.
Mm-hmm and then so he'll star on it i'll.
Shoot it and then i'll do like a rough.
Cut he'll do a fine cut and he will do a.
Color grade i'll do it the color grading.
You'll do sound effects of music mm-hmm.
Yeah we split it up and then we've got.
Like a vfx team if it gets really really.
Heavy you know how big is your full crew.
Then well i don't know it like it.
Depends on the project like sometimes.
It'd just be michael and me and then.
Other times it could be like 15 people.
So just oranges you do then yeah the.
Core is just us - yeah and then we're.
Like a stunt coordinator for the biggest.
Stuff as well so if you want to do wild.
Work or like car crashes and lots of.
Stuff we get in like a part that's all.
In adelaide yeah all in adelaide always.
Never late yeah we are watching that a.
Clip of you guys kind of just like nice.
And by a cornfield or something you guys.
Are just kept jumping on to windshields.
And just doing all right yeah yeah do.
You think the fact that you were raised.
In adelaide and there's like really.
Nothing to do it's a smaller town.
There's so much space that you're kind.
Of like let's utilize this and it was.
Like i think what is really aggressive.
Children like a large city you probably.
Wouldn't like it we still would have.
Like done the same sort of thing it was.
Always like yeah well always those kids.
That your parents wouldn't let you play.
With you know like yeah you were the.
Kids we were those kids hang out with.
Those can you describe your your parents.
Like what are they like like pretty.
Laid-back like my dad was just never.
Home like he was always working so we'd.
Always entertain ourselves and then like.
We had our grandfather that lived with.
My dad that was looking after us then he.
Passed away more 13 and then so like.
Yeah we saw our mum every now and then.
But we provide daddy was just never home.
So we always just you know get rapport.
Stuff yeah.
Yes report we will board we have to.
Express ourselves i mean what did they.
Say when they see these videos though.
Like they must say something right boy.
Yeah like originally i doubt i think it.
Was trying to get us to get a normal job.
But then lice is not started picking up.
Have you guys ever had a normal job.
No i'll so like for me to make money.
Yeah i was like checking into medical.
Trials and testing drugs that were on.
The market oh my gosh yeah and so like.
That was my jokes i can't really do.
Anything else how much do they pay no i.
Wasn't very good it was like probably.
Like 180 bucks a day or something and.
They wouldn't they they take your blood.
Or they inject stuff in yeah yeah so it.
Depends on what the drug is like you.
Check into the hospital for like a month.
At a time or two months and then they're.
Like alright we're gonna test this out.
We've tested on rats but that did that.
Kind of thing i guess it has to exist.
Somewhere in real life so you've.
Actually done it yeah anything like.
Anything crazy yeah so like at one time.
They like it was like a drip though.
Drifting the drug into my arm and then.
It was hurting and i was like oh.
This is hurting like you want us to stop.
No no it's fine.
And then i just kept heard and kept her.
And i could feel it    you know.
Going through me and then my entire left.
Arm just went paralyzed and i couldn't.
Move it and i was like i can't be mom.
But what do you mean i can't be mom like.
Tran squeezed my finger like a cod.
And then once they sort of took it out.
In the drug sort of wore off like i had.
Yeah they tell you what it was yeah they.
Tell me about i did so many of them i.
Said what they'll say is so crazy.
Yeah that's a very cool first job yeah.
It was an awesome job.
How about first job that i was in a vfx.
House when i was 16 but i got fired like.
Two weeks in oh yeah i was terrible the.
Job i don't know i think i'm just.
Terrible at holding a normal job i just.
Couldn't do it like i imagine if you.
Weren't doing the videos are doing these.
Stuff i'd be like yeah what the thing is.
It's hard to go i think it would be hard.
To go back to a normal job but maybe if.
I never had done it maybe i don't know i.
Used to be very just like i'm gonna play.
By the book and just you know graduate.
High school get into a good college get.
A normal job in medicine or something.
And yeah yeah and then now when i think.
About it as like man i don't know how i.
Would be able to work a specific hours.
You know like yeah be hell oh yeah like.
What were you gonna do if you weren't.
Gonna do you film i was gonna.
Being some kind of x-ray like nuclear.
Medicine or something alright yeah yeah.
No no i mean i i was going to try to hey.
I did like a year and a half of college.
Did you go to college no i didn't go to.
College.
I am i did like a year of a media course.
After school okay and then i was in film.
Then.
Yeah like we've been doing us this for.
Like 926 right now and you guys started.
Filming all of your wrestling stuff at.
The age of nine yeah oh we sound like.
Making videos whoa nine and we start.
Arresting a crowned eleven and then we.
Started really hurting each other like.
Around 14 15 was it was it because you.
Guys were like just rough and aggressive.
Or was it because you guys disagreed on.
Things.
No we're just a bunch of pharos like.
Little like like i said our friends were.
Like it was i can really like sort of.
Not the best area and like we'll just.
Have a bunch of feral friends and we're.
Just a bunch of fools that's pretty.
Normal in like adelaide is that like was.
That it considered like a i don't know.
Not a bad area but like a rough just.
Like in like a not like a higher social.
You know area i see yeah it's just that.
There's a word called bogan in australia.
Like where bogans they're like you know.
Is that like true blues right now it's.
Like australia to hillbillies like feral.
Is just like you know like yeah see what.
Bogan.
So you guys have close to 6 million.
Subscribers yeah almost a billion views.
You guys have done pretty well for.
Yourself yeah i think we would have a.
Billion views but youtube keeps removing.
Up yes yeah yeah so you probably already.
Do but there what on private or there.
Just what i remove them there to say oh.
Really yeah it's too dangerous or well i.
Don't know it depends on the video that.
Like this is too violent this was to.
This this was to that and that started.
Happening for you oh i'm pretty pretty.
Early on but once that once the ad.
Pocalypse thing happened we were just.
Screwed like yeah adsense is just.
Nothing you know yeah like i made.
Nothing of had since and then like yeah.
They just started removing and hiding.
Into monetizing and like it was just it.
Was hell so where's your form of revenue.
Coming in then well also like right now.
It's like we live off brand it was.
Pretty much yeah and then say yeah.
You're a patron or anything like that a.
Patron as well yeah yeah but like at the.
Main income would be produce so these.
Brand deals.
I mean the the ad pocalypse it really.
Affected obviously the creators but it.
Was because the brands didn't want to.
Advertise on certain types of content.
Yeah.
So when you guys are working on these.
Brand deals do they feel the same way.
When they're working with like your you.
Know your type of content yeah i think.
So there's like there are certain brands.
That will advertise on our stuff and.
There's like two sites the rack rack i.
Like we have our violence side but we.
Also have like the pg side as well and.
There are lots of brands that want to.
Work on you know crazier content and.
We've spoken to those brands and we've.
Spoken to like google about it and like.
That we've worked at brands with it like.
You can't work with that brand like.
We're not letting that brands in our.
Platform and i'm like you're scaring off.
The people that are gonna advertise for.
Mature content mm-hmm it's it's like.
They just shoot themselves what types of.
Brands would like like advertising yes.
So like it i come so a lot of film and.
Tv stuff you like you know that tv show.
The boys that just came out like they're.
They're keen to have like edgier content.
More like stuff like adam and eve would.
Have edgy or content or you know like.
People like that so like incident you.
Know what does it called vpns and.
Like there are there are lots of brands.
That will have that is down to do it.
Yeah if they want to do that the vile.
Stuff but then we also have the pg stuff.
As well which we can do right altimeter.
Trying to it seems like you're trying to.
Take your career off youtube right angle.
Yeah mainstream movies yeah shows.
Exactly so doc 2018 were like i decided.
I was like i was like i'm not fulfilled.
Anymore on youtube i can't feel so.
Restrictive in like hate it there you.
Know and that just being really there.
Are arseholes.
Yeah was it almost like in a way the.
Whole des monetizing of your channel.
Thicke was it helpful actually to help.
You guys a jump because it's like man.
This isn't worth it anymore yeah i guess.
Yeah i guess it's not a great thing yeah.
But i could see how like you could you.
Know i mean it's a scary thing to leave.
Your bread and butter right yeah exactly.
For something else and then so it was.
Like we had wool riding a film before.
That all happened and it was a thing.
Where we're so caught up with being.
Youtubers and traveling and doing this.
Doing that we never focused on it right.
Was like 2,080 knows i yeah i'm gonna.
Focus on it like this year and like from.
Now on you and then yeah so it worked.
Out apparently the movie could still be.
Crap it comes out i mean that's still.
Pretty like i said it's you don't really.
Hear people writing the first scrip and.
Then selling it selling that first.
Script i.
You hear a lot of writer friends that.
They write out hundreds of scripts and.
These stuff and sold one yet so yeah.
It's pretty amazing yeah yeah i'm really.
Proud of it like uh yeah i'm really.
Really happy with it and you and you.
Said it was a horror script yeah it's a.
Horror film you know just i mean i would.
Have to i don't know why i would have.
Assumed you done like comedy or.
Something yeah i don't know like uh yeah.
I really do love horror so like this is.
A horror film and the other ones were.
Riding or riding one action one and.
Another horror one well action as well.
Yes yeah action really awesome yeah are.
You guys gonna i mean if you make the.
Offer you guys gonna be in the.
Production side - yeah so we're.
Directing it okay yeah yeah i say like.
Uh yeah my brother and i would co-direct.
If i decide to let him in because he's.
Being a bully right now he's doing this.
Thing this whole distract warn me on.
Like on our channel yeah but is that.
That did that plan no yeah it was like.
Well he's like i'm doing just check on.
You and you better respond i was like.
What the heck so he like made me out to.
Be some like money-hungry villain and he.
Video and say i was like i thought i had.
Two hours to wrap mine though yeah i'll.
Just play i'll play the villain but.
You're more of the writer out of the two.
Right yeah we had five weeks for use.
That team at two hours to write mine i.
Was like so i just sort of slept to give.
Her something really crafted i was like.
I'll just play the villain i was like.
Rapping about beaches and money like.
That's what like the whole thing was.
About like as a joke but in my audience.
Like oh yeah danny is like to sell out.
Marco is the one that's dedicated to the.
Original stuff but also that    so.
Like everyone's against you right now.
But he is a bully it sounds like you.
Guys have sibling rivalry yeah i guess.
So a little bit all right this is the.
First time he brought my car of the.
Video like he like i left the car back.
In australia that i do drive and he took.
It to my cousin's farm and blow it up.
And i was like he blocked my car i was.
Like it's not necessarily done cold for.
It makes no sense you seem so happy.
About it it's using you're just a happy.
Person in a happy person yeah he blows.
My car's pretty good it's like he blew.
It up so i was like okay well i've.
Already sang to his card and so he's at.
A really expensive guys got jerry.
Rovol are things i know the range rover.
Service yeah yes oh he is one of those.
In that i got a friend to smear    on.
His windshield and where was the.
From my friends also you want to see.
This stuff it may or may not be on.
Youtube yeah as it may remove it they.
Didn't remove it and they really say.
That they removed it.
You can't put shootable windshield well.
You brought my car what the    is what.
My old reaction from a blown-up car yeah.
It's so small and then he's like stained.
It like smells like    permanently.
Take it to the wash a couple of times i.
Can't scrape off the char bone like my.
Car's completely totaled closer you guys.
I mean obviously there's like this.
Rivalry and i'm sure a lot of it is for.
Youtube right yeah but how close are you.
Guys like really are scenes well like we.
Don't really talk about anything other.
Than this stuff i mean like yeah yeah so.
It's sort of like there's more business.
I think it's more business i wouldn't.
Like have a bad day we should talk about.
Yeah i've been the case growing up yeah.
I think so yeah must be is at some point.
Where we just sort of stopped being.
Problems now we'll just like business.
Partners right yeah geez way as twins.
You know you hear stories about twins.
Feeling certain things or like saying.
Things at the same time across the world.
And you know those types of stories like.
Have you ever experienced any sort of.
Strange yes it's so like it's a weird.
Superpower like i if he needs to piss i.
Need to piss that's pretty good power so.
That that was the one thing and then the.
Other thing is that yeah we sometimes.
Would say the same things at the same.
Time yeah and like saying you know at.
The same time just because you're just.
So similar yeah i guess so.
So like i don't know that they're the.
Two weird things that apart from that.
Like i can't talk to him right now.
Without talking him on the phone like i.
Can't communicate with him no yeah yeah.
But i wonder if like you know they they.
Used to do those weird experiments back.
In the world war like hitler dude.
They're like oh we're gonna take twins.
Into submarines yeah take one into one.
Room one of the other and then kill one.
And see if there's any reaction to the.
Other one hmm so like yeah i don't know.
Like maybe apparently those experiments.
Worked so i don't know oh i've heard of.
That.
Yeah i know what the results were yeah.
Yeah should maybe do a video on that.
That might be interesting yeah i think.
Mark would be shot the head just smear.
On his face and know what yeah well.
Yeah he was angry well i guess since the.
Whole you know you're changing focus.
From youtube into doing your own script.
Yeah you guys kind of like branched out.
And you guys started collabing a lot.
More during that year ah no we we.
Clapping i think from the start like uh.
Like i think we have uh such as the.
Different starts what everyone was doing.
So we were able to get some pretty big.
Collapse pretty quickly like like logan.
Pole and like kay aside and that sort of.
Stuff like that they're keen to work.
With us so like we got into those clubs.
Pretty quickly like after our first year.
On youtube we started clapping all these.
People i actually wrote a script once.
For ryan oh really yeah ben you remember.
Ben grubbs yeah yeah who sent it we.
Never heard back from you i don't know i.
Don't remember ever getting a script to.
Be honest i really don't i really seen.
Your stuff before i mean i seen back.
When you guys did like the star wars and.
Yeah yeah this is dope and especially.
Back then like that was like yeah unique.
You know it's just like yeah those guys.
Are dope i don't remember ever getting a.
Strip really unless what was it supposed.
To be like me and not going to.
Australian no no it was i could get it.
Was like extreme tag was the video.
Well like you will microverse and trevor.
And tag and it got like you're like now.
You're at now you're at than yours that.
Crash cart we travel now you're.
Definitely not remember yeah we wrote it.
For for ryan well i mean if you're ever.
You know gonna go back to youtube.
If you're tired you're tired of selling.
Movies you know i mean i'm down first.
Channel is in need of it.
I can't like say you this time you still.
Post normal videos along with the nut.
This year i've actually been like taking.
A break this i've been doing the podcast.
Yeah yeah cuz i was like just i mean you.
Know i mean you said the same thing.
You've kind of felt like unfulfilled.
Yeah yeah just got tiresome you know i.
Felt like i was making the same things.
And like yeah get it like oh this will.
Get views cuz it's popular and you make.
Something cool out of it but it's not.
Like it's not growth yeah yeah so for me.
I mean i don't know if i don't know i'm.
Just putting words in your mouth but.
That's all no no i completely uh yeah it.
Does feel repetitive and you do feel.
Like - doing the same thing yeah and.
Then when you repeat it like if i you've.
Done this before knowing you stray from.
It i coulis.
Yeah told you you've changed exactly.
Yeah yeah i mean people for the longest.
Time because we started doing these.
Podcasts and so different from is the.
First time i'm actually being myself.
Like on a-- yeah in first channel videos.
And people were like alright why are you.
So grouchy or like why are you why.
You're not happy all the time like you.
Know like you know people just didn't.
Know and i just got tired of just i.
Guess doing the same thing i think a.
Break figure you know but we're still.
Making other content yeah yeah but still.
Trying to figure out what i want to do.
It was nuts free it was pretty.
Exhausting dudes content just like that.
Though i know but you you were like.
Doing it weekly yeah for a little bit it.
Was like you were pretty consistent like.
I would go between like two months about.
Uploading sometimes yeah yeah so props.
To you i mean you guys did some like.
Your dinner uno video and when did that.
Come out oh that was 2016 i think yeah i.
Think when do we do ours before me so.
Yeah so it was a little before that i.
Was like oh this is pretty like we were.
Pretty happy with it and then yours came.
Out i was like okay well now ours is it.
Relevant like live-action and like ours.
Is just    like what you guys did i.
Was like okay okay these guys are good.
So you guys kept getting better so.
There's a sec okay i don't wanna like.
Ben's pretty dependable so yeah yeah.
There's probably something i missed.
Yeah yeah but talking about how you guys.
Are kind of like you know taking a break.
And finding that compromise and stuff a.
Lot of times with artists they'll be.
Like oh i want to express my true self.
But then it's like how do i make money.
With that yeah.
I think with you because like your.
Guys's videos are getting blocked or.
Hidden or sometimes monetized and it's.
Like why don't you just show less.
Violence and you guys are just like we.
Love violence though yeah well i think.
That it was sort of like they were.
Hiding things that weren't even violent.
Like if it was like certain amount of.

Positive yeah i've got like a weird drug.
Lasting effect i had a friend that once.

Rats and they bought every one in a week.
After they done the drugs they're like.
We don't want to worry anyone but the.
The rats that we tested the drug on some.
Of them have gone blind so like that was.

Thank you for but i did love checking in.

Was still doing youtube videos when i.
Was doing the drug trials and i was like.
Aw crap we don't need to do it anymore.
You know but i still feel like i want to.
Check in and watch something while i'm.
In there yeah i'm sad to do some kind of.
Like non-disclosure right when you're.

Yourself that'd be interesting already.
Oh you know definitely yeah but i would.
Be that would be really cool like today.
I'm paralyzed.

Abner i love i love hanging out over but.
Yeah we are just friends like your bff.
She is my bff attea yeah yeah.
Would you i mean i mean would you be.
Interested in dating her so it's a thing.
Where it's an awkward thing because you.
Know i'm like i've got feelings for.
Someone else right now back in australia.
Unless it's like really one side and.
Unreciprocated say okay i've just had my.
Heart broken for so long and then came.
Out to la and i was like i need to try.
And get away from feelings you know i.
Don't want to feel anything anymore.
Mmm well staying with the porn stars.
Awaited.
Don't entertain oh yeah she's like as a.
Youtuber do you do you date like you.
Have a girlfriend have you had like so.
This is this is the one thing i just got.
My heart broken so bad for so long i.
Just don't want anything right now well.
Not even breakup like it was never even.
A thing it was like unreciprocated.
One-sided lala it was ages like i lost.
Count the years wow oh yeah you've been.
In love with this woman for many years.
Yes man it was just not reciprocated.
Yeah yeah it was really really one-sided.
It was never really a thing and i always.
Thought well maybe it'll be a thing one.
Day but it just wasn't si was like yeah.
It was really really painful and it was.
Like it's the point where i'd get.
Anxiety before i saw them like i was i'd.
Swear my heart's pounding i'm like oh my.
God so i'm so used to getting hurt by.
Them you know and yeah it was just a.
Really it's like a close friend kind of.
Thing because it seems like yeah yeah.
Like i still saw them and hung out with.
Them and everything so like i i got.
Really good friends with them and always.
Spoke to them but it was just yeah.
Feelings were never the same so as we.
Pick at the scab and open up a l boom.
Yeah yeah i guess what was the turning.
Point where you're like this is not.
Gonna work well i was like um well i.
Started riding when i was upset so.
There's a lot of that stuff in my.
Scripts so maybe that's why i got picked.
Up picked up because there's a lot of.
Like i felt really i guess authentic for.
Like for some area yeah like i said like.
I want that stuff is in the script and.
All sort of like therapy to ride it.
You know and then also i was writing i.
Was writing songs a bit as well for some.
Artists like a bit of guys writing stuff.
And it got to the point where i was like.
Picking fights as a person so i could.
Like get upset to write lyrics it was.
Just a weird toxic thing artists scripts.
Yeah but yeah like i'll even now the i.
Don't know it's just still like a really.
Weird thing you know well before this.
Crush that you had lasted x amount of.
Years.
Did you like while you tubers still did.
You yes you have like a girlfriend later.
Yeah it was like i don't know playing.
The field a bit i guess never never like.
A proper girlfriend yeah yeah never.
Never that like it's always been that.
You know messing around or maybe but.
Like it was never like i never had like.
A proper proper relationship for anyone.
Are you ready for one.
Ah well no now i'm not now i'm like no.
Way yeah.
Good that's to painful it hurts too much.
Yeah it's like i mean but if the right.
One came along yeah possibly like i yeah.
Ah today i'd rather not right now.
It'd be a thing where i'm like maybe in.
A couple years down the track or.
Something it hurts too much and i've.
Still got feelings for this other person.
Am i it doesn't feel like they're gonna.
Go away anytime soon you know you know.
What if this movie does really well yeah.
It might work maybe definitely at that.
Point do you still take that you never.
Know people change they're really.
Awesome person there but it was just.
Yeah just sad times guys i need a break.
Now.
It'll be better yeah how's your.
Brother's love life then you can    on.
That.
Yeah let's    on that donna i don't.
Know like i he's i think he's more of a.
Sleep round sort of guy right now as.
Well i guess he's not looking for.
Something i don't know though i don't.
Really talk to him about it.
Mmm that's how much we don't talk about.
Things but like yeah who knows i know.
There's a girl that's interested in here.
Interested in him here but i don't know.
Maybe hmm.
We'll see i just said that like our.
Productivity will go down if we're in a.
Relationship.
Yeah true you know yeah do you feel that.
I feel like you definitely if you're not.
In a relationship you don't have to you.
Can focus on what you're interested in.
Yeah you have to worry about another.
Person so yeah i think you can still.
Make it work but it is time time is like.
Limited you know yeah yeah and you have.
To use some that time so how long how.
Long have you been in your relationship.
For about a little over three years.
Almost four years yeah yeah that's.
Awesome see ya love when love loves back.
For me affirmed you ryan.
Well that's oh i don't know if it was it.
To the same degree yeah that you're.
Describing yeah a lot a lot of the.
Previous girlfriends that i've had word.
Ended up premium of yeah that and it.
Yeah for the most part just didn't work.
Out yeah it wasn't like same scenario i.
Guess yeah how many had serious ones.
Right like maybe like 4 4 3 3 3 yeah.
So yukon high school that's why oh.
That's like high school is like a couple.
Years yeah well that still sounds like.
It could be serious yeah yeah maybe but.
Yeah holy crap for relationships yeah.
Yeah.
You've got your experience then uh i.
Mean not really like this is the one i'm.
In currently the longest relationship.
I've been in yeah i'm still learning are.
You gonna get married have children well.
I mean that's one of the things to it.
Like i'm still trying to figure out i.
Mean i think obviously that's always.
Been the goal yeah you know your kid.
Like i said i had a plan and then that's.
Completely changed.
Ya know so it's hard to say i mean yeah.
I mean with you like are you if you're.
Gonna be working in this area are you.
Gonna stay in la uh so yeah i think it.
Will be like a back-and-forth thing it.
It depends on where we're gonna shoot.
This film though mm-hmm like i'm if.
We're gonna shoot it here then i'll stay.
Here if we're gonna shoot it in.
Australia then i head back to australia.
Right but even in being even after this.
Movie though like you're probably gonna.
Write more and have to come back out and.
Pitch yeah yeah so like i think i want.
To be out here if i've got a purpose to.
Be out here even for like it when i.
Travel i'd rather travel if i've got.
Something to travel for i hate just.
Travelling for the sake of traveling you.
Know like if i'm doing a brand here i'll.
Go there or for shooting this here i'll.
Go there right so like if i've got a.
Purpose to be in la then like i'll come.
Out here you think you get over a live.
Out here i do really miss friends back.
Home it is like it's really yeah but.
Like yeah i think so i think i'd love to.
Have a house here in a house in la and.
Go back and forth cuz i'm back and forth.
Anyway but like yeah like i always spend.
Heaps of time here then i'm like i.
Really miss home and then i go back home.
And i go i really miss la so it's like.
Yeah it's always i think it'll be i.
Think i'll have a home in both places.
What do you what do you miss about it.
Adelaide ah having my heart broken.
Really.
Laughter.
No i think it's like um yeah like the.
Friends and family like uh you know this.
Going it's crew yeah i think i think.
It's mostly missing friends and family.
And also it's a lot easier to shoot.
Natalie you know it's hard to shoot in.
La like it oh yeah it's terrible yeah.
Well you can't blow    up here.
Speaking of blowing stuff what like some.
Of your videos it has extremely high.
Production value yeah.
What's like the most you guys have ever.
Spent on a single in a video i mean you.
Don't have to answer but no i will.
Answer it it's a it's a pretty stupid.
Answer so like one time we dropped 130 k.
In a video and i got to monetize and.
Stuff from one hundred and thirty.
Thousand us dollars so that's australian.
Dollars poi like around 90 to 100 k.
Money and then like it was dragon ball z.
Versus avatar hmm i said like we did.
Like we built these sets we're like.
Flooding sets we built we're like it was.
Just like like massive vfx shots and.
Like it was like a lot you know even.
Like i'm all sinking the set it was so.
Expensive.
We i love the video but i just got the.
Wallet i straightaway we made like.
Harden him what we made off that but no.
Idea what he's meant yeah it was the.
Biggest waste of money oh there was a.
Brat like a brandy oh and there's some.
More no no no bro yeah so you guys just.
We were like we want to make this we.
Want to be this money yeah like we.
Always like there's things that we want.
To take off and things that we want to.
Do like i want to do a flooding set so.
He made the video based on the flooding.
Set alright you know there's stuff like.
We're doing in this harry potter star.
Wars video where it's like i want to do.
That you know that harry potter car that.
Flies look i want to do that practically.
So like we've like that practical flying.
Car yeah yeah i'm gonna show you there's.
Not much really cool so like michael was.
Dangling off the door and it's like.
Flying through the air yeah it's really.
Cool.
Luckily a brand did this video though.
Okay yeah so like yeah that's correct.
How do you like learn all this cuz.
You're like you said you didn't really.
Care for school or anything yeah you.
Couldn't hold down a job but when you.
Find this passion how do you learn that.
Well i don't know like um i guess stunts.
She sort of learns to it your own way.
But then we've got a stunt coordinator.
As well which we can say i want to do.
This this and this and then he can.
Properly plot it out and planned.
And he's really good at that so yeah.
Shell out judd judd wild i say he's.
Awesome and like for our film we're.
Definitely gonna get him you know and.
Then i don't know just like you practice.
Over the years and you get better at it.
You get better at doing whatever you're.
Rehearsing so each video that we do is.
Like it's a practice ground you know.
Just kind of just like combining old.
Ideas together interesting yeah all the.
Skills that you learn over those years.
And craft yeah so like yeah ike i'm.
Really excited for this video to come.
Out cuz it's really big and like it's.
Super exciting like so besides the whole.
Unrequited love situation where else did.
You draw i would say i like but where do.
You where else did you get your like.
Inspiration from you know yeah it's a.
Weird thing i do this thing to my.
Friends which is pretty cruel if i'm.
Really fixated on like how would people.
React to a certain situation in real.
Life you know so like i'd act out or.
Pretend something's happening to certain.
People pissy example yeah yeah there was.
A big project that we worked on on the.
Rock record i don't want to say it.
Because i people still think that it's.
Rule on our channel but like there was a.
Project that we did that wasn't real and.
Then like no one knew that it wasn't.
Real everyone like we played it out like.
It was real and everyone's reactions.
Were completely like what's going on and.
Like you got you get to see people's.
Real reactions because everyone has a.
Face of how they acting real laughter.
Then like you know when something.
Actually happens you know everyone.
Changes so i'm just i'm so interested in.
That sort of thing like with the script.
There seems that i wrote it was like i.
Want to act this out with you know you.
Know my friends and see how these people.
Would actually react in situations do.
You have characters based off of your.
Real-life friends and in a way yeah ish.
Like i based characters unlike is i find.
It easier to write if i've got someone.
Around for me i can fix this person in.
My head i can know how this person talk.
And i'll hang out with someone a lot to.
Get their lingo and get how they would.
Speak and like find out how they would.
React to certain things so i do i do.
Like yeah i do i do definitely based.
Certain characters off for certain.
People and like yeah and then like in.
This film as characters at a base to.
Myself you know elements of that and.
Then yet a lot from like friends and all.
That socially it's so like yeah like.
There's like um fight for example.
There's like a scene in our script where.
His kids offered like a cigarette from.
His friend and he really looks up to the.
Friends and he i come he like i wanted.
To see how like our neighbor would react.
To that so i offered a cigarette i don't.
Smoke or anything i'm never gonna give.
It to him to see how you react to that.
Gyan i mean yeah so like our today is.
Just looking at that sort of thing fun.
People's behaviour interesting that's.
Really interesting cuz i remember ryan.
Saying something similar to me like he.
Likes seeing the reactions making.
Somebody feel something when you make.
Your content oh yeah that was but he's.
Doing it just to make his never to.
People that can't handle its people oh.
My god what's happening they're having.
Fun of it it's never i'm not like.
Traumatizing anyway like it's people.
That can take it like friends that know.
Me and stuff and so like once they find.
Out that this is like a prank or this is.
Whatever like if people are covert it's.
Fine.
So generally these people are cool with.
It but like at first was it kind of like.
Oh do they feel like you're using them.
Or no really it'd be a thing where i'm.
Like outside will you mean the someone.
Walking around outside and like jt like.
That sort of stop and then we get out.
There's not really anyone walking that.
Just were to happen right now and then.
We just to see how we would react to see.
How you do i was just doing a thing like.
It's not a prank i'm just trying to.
Study yeah i was just study it's like ah.
Yeah and then people know they're like.
Oh you know okay it's never i would.
Anyone go like oh man that's too far.
You're the boy who cried wolf actually.
Someone else    come out and paper.
Right there i know it's doing funny but.
Like yeah it probably is a little bit.
Mean now that i think of it but yeah our.
Friends are walking further down bright.
Heads.
So i'm us so we got some some questions.
From some fans yeah okay so we got one.
Here it says so you're friends with both.
Ksi yeah.
They have a fight coming up they do.
Indeed know your gods.
Who are you closer to and who are you.
Rooting for it's a weird thing where.
It's like it's even for me because.
Whatever i'm hanging out of case i might.
Cast ah so cool he's so amazing yeah.
Team casa but i hang out with logan i'm.
Like yeah logan so cool too like i.
Always said they'd be such good friends.
You know in real life if they won't be.
Thing like this and you set up the first.
Fight too right yeah yeah cuz our logan.
Didn't want to do it originally saw flew.
Out and spoke to logan about it and i.
Was like i'd won money on k sighs fight.
I was like i'm gonna put money on this.
One but i just couldn't bring myself to.
Bet on either of them i don't want to.
Root for ya cuca sauce jj what i'm like.
I don't want to see logan getting his.
Ass kicked i don't see ya so it was like.
Um yeah i can't pick a side like it's.
Impossible like i hated watching that.
Fight mm-hmm it was so painful to watch.
I was like yeah you're watching two.
Friends beat the    out of each other.
It's awful i hated it you know it's fine.
Wait when we had chaos on the podcast we.
Asked him like could you ever be friends.
With logan and he said he could he.
Thinks he could he thinks he could yeah.
Yeah and but then he said he would never.
Be friends with jake but i thought it.
Was so interesting because there logan.
And ki are beefing right yeah what are.
They are they are he said he thinks he.
Could be i might be misquoting but.
Thinks he could be friends with him.
Anderson i said that's a logan and.
Logan's like no not like i think logan's.
Like not with it now like i don't know.
If i i feel like they could still be.
From so interesting you instigated that.
You means that it's more studying.
Running the world from behind the scenes.
Like i'm curious what did that what did.
You say to logan to convince him i was.
Just i saw i went there and i was like i.
Just came back from this fight you know.
And like can't cycle drugs like i saw.
That what he does even up late like.
Logan was sort of like you know jj.
Doesn't really upload much but i just.
Kept like i just kept talking about.
Every day and bringing up every day and.
I was just like it would be the biggest.
Event in internet history logan like.
It's huge right he's the biggest.
Youtuber of the uk you're the biggest.
Youtuber over the us it's a clash of the.
Titans brah like i don't know i was just.
Yeah that's push for three months he's.
Like i got.
These are for three months spent all of.
Is that i think i was left like two.
Weeks trying to convince him like i was.
Like really trying to convince him like.
Yeah and he eventually said yeah i'm.
Gonna do it brah but you know i think he.
Was great i think the the fact that they.
Both fought it was super exciting for.
The community yeah it was a sport like.
It was like not like an actual.
Aggressive leg like i remember we got.
Like like we did an interview with bbc.
Before the fire and they sounded like it.
Was so this is a while as youtube's.
Promoting violence in all this sort of.
Crap like it's a boxing match what are.
You talking about this violence yeah.
Like they like jumped like yeah like.
Yeah i don't know they were just trying.
To villainize it yeah you can say that.
About espn there yeah yeah it's a.
They've got boxing gloves on yeah i just.
I don't know no head guards oh i'm.
Scared someone's me an octet is a i mean.
For sure problem i mean they were taking.
Hits last time oh big hits they didn't.
Have that i mean that's i can't they.
Can't get knocked out i'm i want them to.
Both make it's like if you lose my.
Points it's not that bad but if someone.
Gets knocked out is gonna be hard to.
Watch painful to watch they're gonna.
Mean the    out of like like it's.
Gonna be terrible for the loser if.
There's a knock i feel bad for like hope.
It doesn't happen you care about both of.
Them yeah i'd hate to see any of them.
Get knocked out and there's such big.
Personalities and like you know they're.
All their family and friends are such as.
Males in their communities and i don't.
Know it just.
I'd feel gonna be painful to see for.
Sure that's when's that happening.
November the 9th yeah so we have another.
Question from a new burps sorry sorry.
About that.
Apologize instagram in in twitter from a.
Man em7 can you have a fight with.
Michael i think what they meant is would.
You maybe box all thanks michael yeah.
Everyone's like oh this dis track stuff.
Is just for like a setup for the.
Undercard fight.
I'll be honest right now i'd get my.
Head kick in if i fault michael.
I've definitely is he stronger than you.
Oh yeah waste talking to me like he's.
Like he's easy ease the dominant win for.
Sure i would get destroyed by michael.
Like is because he works out and stuff.
And you don't or yeah i think so and.
He's just more physically active like i.
Sit and write and edit and michael cut.
Up and he's like yeah yes i like get.
Destroyed it would be fun though to get.
My head keeping my mark.
Laughter.
It'd be cool to see a boxing chess match.
Like one round boxing one round chess.
Yeah there you go see there we go.
Terrible idea yeah alright we got.
Another question here from oh daddy jack.
Oh daddy jack this is a little more.
Serious question i think okay would you.
Die for your brother what i'd die for my.
Brother uh yeah probably if someone on a.
Gun i don't know what's the situation.
Spell out a scenario for me there's a.
Gun and pointed at your brother's head.
Either you go or you go i'd say like.
Honest i'd say take him yeah.
Well this would be a research thing he.
Doesn't have to set up and see what the.
Real reaction yeah yes we're gonna prank.
Him now and actually kill him now yeah i.
Would die for him to be honest if like.
If some of the guns were said i'd.
Probably really traumatically jump in.
Front of the bullet and take it for him.
What do you do the same maybe see this.
Is the thing see everyone's got their.
Answers of what they'd say but how would.
Someone truly react what's true you have.
To set up the scenario and find out.
