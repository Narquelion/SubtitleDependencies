Hey guys so as you can tell from the.
Title this video is gonna be about how.
To know if you have adhd or not and for.
Those of you that don't already know.
Adhd is attention deficit hyperactive.
Disorder the reason i'm making this.
Video is because i feel like a lot of.
People these days say or they think they.
Have adhd but that's only because they.
Don't know what it's really like to have.
As a little kid i was diagnosed with it.
But i never took any meds for it so i.
Never knew what normal people thought.
But i can't stand when people say that.
Adhd is not a real thing and that it's.
Just an excuse for lazy people to blame.
Their laziness on what i can't stand.
Even more is that when people actually.
Do use it as an excuse even when they.
Don't have it just because they didn't.
Do well in school or they're bad at.
Studying or something but really there's.
No excuse because i grew up with it and.
I didn't take any medication for it i.
Still got all a's and b's and again i.
Also cheated a lot so after watching.
This video if you can honestly say that.
You relate to more of these things than.
Not then chances are i mean i'm not a.
Doctor but your brain is probably just.
As messed up as mom i'm gonna be giving.
You guys actual examples not those.
Typical adhd joke you know which jokes.
I'm talking about i'll be talking and.
Then all of a sudden pretend to be.
Distracted by something kind of like.
What i'm about to do right oh look a.
Butterfly i mean even i made that joke.
But only as a joke because that is such.
A huge exaggeration it's really nothing.
Like that most of the time if they sound.
Unrealistic to you it's probably just.
Because you don't have it trust me.
They're all real they actually do happen.
I would know because sadly they're all.
My personal experiences so without.
Further ado do and no more hesitation.
Here are some real examples to help you.
Guys know if you actually do or do not.
I'm not even kidding there's an actual.
Butterfly right there i gotta see how.
Many of these you can relate to go you.
Meet someone new and then five seconds.
After they've introduced themselves you.
Already forgot their name no matter how.
Hard you try to focus whenever you're.
Reading something like a book or a text.
Bloom read every single word on the page.
You hear every single word in your head.
You had five pages down the road you.
Have no idea what's going on or how you.
Got them you look at someone straight in.
The eyes and rather than paying.
Attention to what they're saying you're.
Trying to decide which eye you normally.
Look at the left eye or the right eye.
Maybe it's the nose or the mouth or.
Maybe you're supposed to look at the.
Face as a whole but you already forgot.
To do that because now all you see is a.
Bunch of face part to you there's no.
Such thing as sitting still you don't.
Realize it until someone tells you to.
Stop but you either been rapidly shaking.
Your legs hopping your hands or not in.
Your head to music that isn't there or.
Playing with whatever is currently in.
Your hands like a cell phone you're a.
Time traveler you go in take a five.
Minute facebook break from work when you.
Come back it's an hour later sometimes.
You have to remind yourself to smile.
When you're with people or not because.
You don't like them or because you're.
Upset it's because you have a bunch of.
Other thoughts going through your head.
That aren't smile words no matter how.
Hard you try or how important the call.
Is when you're on the phone with someone.
You have to be doing something else at.
The same time you don't intentionally.
Procrastinate just most productive when.
You have to get something done you work.
Best when you're under pressure again.
You don't intentionally procrastinate.
But you can never decide what you want.
From a menu until you're under pressure.
Because the waiter just got to you you.
Have a bunch of incomplete things.
Because you're always jumping from one.
Thing to the next you leave your room to.
Go get your phone that you forgot in the.
Kitchen when you come back all you have.
Is a cup of water snacks and pretty much.
Everything that's not your phone a lot.
Of the times that you're on the phone.
With people you freak out because you.
Can't find your phone you're not sure if.
You just came downstairs or if you're.
About to go home force yourself to burp.
To remember what you had for lunch.
And somebody tells you the thing about.
One specific thing you can't because now.
You're thinking about thinking about.
Things causing you to not think about.
What you're supposed to be thinking.
About detects something that makes.
Absolutely no sense because someone was.
Talking to you and you write out what.
They were saying instead i can remember.
A full phone number by repeating the.
Numbers in your head.
The moment you start putting into the.
Keypad all the different sounds and the.
Key tones throw you off and you forget.
You have to buy a lot of shampoo because.
When you're in the shower you have the.
Most thoughts and you don't even realize.
That you just wash your hair three times.
You hate working in groups not because.
Of other people have bad ideas it's just.
That their ideas distract yours you.
Overly set reminders for yourself when.
Important things are coming up because.
You know you're gonna forget you always.
Have these silent awkward moments with.
People because when you're talking to.
Them you always forget what you're about.
To say mid-sentence and when you do it's.
Like like you have these you're very.
Indecisive i mean i guess this one kind.
Of applies to everyone or not or maybe.
I'm last but not least you have adhd.
Every single thought leads to another.
Thought and i can actually kind of learn.
How to use that to my advantage when i'm.
Coming up with videos for example i'm.
Just gonna freestyle something right now.
Just to show you all my brain works see.
You could be thinking about this video.
And your mind could still go off in like.
An infinite amount erections which is.
The opposite of one direction maybe.
That's how they got their name because.
They all have adhd adhd like attention.
Deficit hyperactive disorder disorder i.
Mean who says it's a disorder anyway.
Speaking of disorder who came up with.
The word disorder it kind of sounds like.
A rapper trying to order at a bakery hey.
Let me get this ordered doe a deer a.
Female deer like bambi bambi whatever.
Happened to bam a-and bam see what is a.
Bam see maybe they meant see bam is when.
The seagull is bam that's like the waves.
Crashing and waves are created by win.
And win can go in every single direction.
Which is the opposite of one direction.
And that's what they got their name.
That's how they got their name from the.
Multi-directional wind causing the waves.
To crash agassiz bam bam see.
And be dear like a rapper trying to get.
Disordered oh creating the word disorder.
And adhd which is what all the guys in.
One direction have which is the complete.
Opposite of the different direction this.

How i remembered all that i mean it was.
A freestyle so i didn't have to like.
Memorize anything but at the same time i.
Had to remember how to say it backwards.
