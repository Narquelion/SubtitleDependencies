Hey guys i'm sure by now a lot of you.
Have already seen or at least heard.
About these this new trend this poi.
Called a fidget spinner yes once again.
The internet has blessed us with another.
Wonderful trend that everyone can't stop.
Talking about so much so that i can't.
Even ignore this one because it's so.
Heavily requested by you guys in my.
Comments dear ryan can you make a video.
About fidget spinner dear ryan can you.
Do fidget spinner trick shot here ryan.
Right your hair still look gay me what.
Pitcher spinners are one of the biggest.
Trends in the world right now.
So of course had to go pick one up to.
See what all the fuss was about and here.
It is yeah this thing right here that's.
All it does it spins okay it is like.
Three sir well it's still going because.
It's kind of fat kind of fast okay yeah.
Like most people in my age if you're in.
Your twenties you probably took one look.
At this trend and says is so stupid why.
Would anybody waste their money on this.
Well it does is spin and to be.
Completely honest this video was.
Originally gonna be me making fun and.
Bashing these things and people that.
Play with them you know kind of like.
What everybody else is doing right now.
But after seeing all the hate for this.
Little harmless somewhat useless toy i.
Just had like this epiphany.
It wasn't like this it i don't know what.
I'm doing we are a society that just.
Hates the generation below we hate.
Everything that they do all the trends.
They start because we think that our.
Generation is the best and the smartest.
And upcoming generations are only.
Getting worse and worse i'm not just.
Singling out our generation this is an.
Ongoing pattern that has been happening.
Forever i mean think about it when we.
Are growing up the generation above us.
Complained about us in the same way when.
We were kids sam you kid the rap music.
Game boys and polka man back in my day.
We used to play stickball outside and.
Listen to the classics like dirty if.
You're around my age i'm pretty positive.
That somebody older than you has said.
The exact same thing to you before and.
Yes it was annoying because they just.
Didn't understand because they're old.
They were just being haters well take a.
Look in the mirror.
That's us now we're the old haters our.
Generation is literally doing the same.
Thing now damn you kids in your.
Hoverboards and babes and lil yachty is.
Back in my day we used to ride bicycles.
It had beyblade and we listened to real.
Music like eminem britney spears and the.
Backstreet boys yeah i don't know why.
Our generation sounds sold we're still.
In our 20s but you get the point you see.
It's an ongoing cycle of hate and it all.
Stems from our arrogant we think that.
Growing up we had the best childhood.
Because of how proud we are of ourselves.
You believe that the younger generation.
Has to have a childhood like ours if.
They want to be as successful and.
Knowledgeable and hardworking as we are.
That's why when older generations see.
Kids doing trends like this you always.
See them say things like oh our future.
Is doomed or i'm losing faith in.
Humanity or something else negative and.
No i'm not making a video just to defend.
These things i agree that these toys are.
You know kind of useless and not really.
Worth the money but that's exactly the.
Point their toys.
Just because we're older now and way too.
Mature to play with these things doesn't.
Mean we gotta hate it i mean you think.
This is stupid think about the toys we.
Grew up with we had pogs okay we.
Collected and play with little circular.
Pieces of cardboard that with pictures.
On them that we would slam on the ground.
To try and flip over other little.
Circular pieces of cardboard with.
Pictures on them and that was fun well.
What about trading cards our generation.
Loved trading cards some of us still do.
From pokemon cars to ukyo to magic the.
Gathering and like reading card for a.
Huge and we were growing up and they.
Were expensive that's right we paid a.
Bunch of money for a bunch of pieces of.
Paper with.
Is on there wasn't even cardboard and.
Yes i understand these were games you.
Could play them and these these you.
Can't play games with these they just.
Spin right well then maybe who can.
Explain chattering remember those that's.
Right kids we had chattering for a short.
Amount of time chatter means were just.
As popular as these in the world when we.
Were growing up and literally all it was.
Was a bunch of little rings that you.
Would spin onto a bigger ring and keep.
Spinning the bigger ring so that.
Littering keeps spinning and make a.
Bunch of noise with them yeah that.
Didn't sound stupid back then i do.
Remember some adults saying that was.
Stupid back then and i laughed at that.
They laughed at me that's how it went.
They did i didn't laugh at them still.
Not enough you also play with yo-yos.
Which is a wheel and that's attached to.
A string that you wind up and then.
Unravel really fast so that the wheel.
Spin it's a little younger than my.
Generation but we also had beyblades.
There were little toy tops that you.
Would spin to hit other tops i was like.
Taking two of these spinning them and.
Then hitting each other with them oh.
Great.
Look at that came off whoops we had gak.
It was literally just goo that you could.
Touch i don't know we had slinkys a.
Spring-like toy that you would place at.
The top of the stairs and then watch it.
Go down those stairs this is starting to.
Sound even worse con depressed we even.
Had whatever how this thing is i don't.
Think anyone even knew what these things.
Were even supposed to be but a lot of us.
Had them like this soft slippery sausage.
Licking thing but it had like an inside.
So you could like put your finger in it.
Or hold it and like kind of move it.
Around and wait a second you see.
What i mean i'm not saying that these.
Things aren't stupid okay because they.
Are why are we eating in the younger.
Generation when we are just as stupid as.
They or maybe even stupider okay we had.
This thing it doesn't make sense we're.
Hypocrites oh i'm sorry if you thought.
This video was gonna be what most people.
Are doing which is hating on fidget.
Spinners fact i am gonna do the opposite.
And show you how awesome and useful.
These things are okay i can name like.
Hundreds of uses off the top of my hand.
Like you can spin them forwards you can.
Spin them spin the backwards kind of you.
Can use it like a ninja star in case.
It's a burglar in your house it could be.
The propeller of a mini helicopter maybe.
Even a blender if you're blending like.
Really soft easy to blend things you can.
Use it to draw the perfect circle the.
Perfect flower brush your teeth faster.
Get some spinners on your rims you don't.
Look like a baller or like a ceiling.
And for really tiny people a lazy susan.
For really lazy people test your.
Eyesight one or two pretty much the same.
Could use it as a magnet you could use a.
Strobe light you could even use it to.
Explain to your mom what your gauge.
Years are gonna look lysee.
There are hundreds and hundreds of.
Different use okay yeah there's not a.
Lot you can do with come on it cost like.
Ten dollars.
What can you even do with ten dollars.
And what would you rather have a ten.
Dollar bill or one of these see that you.
Can't spin a ten dollar bill yeah we.
Also had a game like this growing up.
Kids it was kind of frowned upon over.
All i'm trying to say is all this hate.
That we show to other generations.
Especially the younger generations are.
So unnecessary and kinda hypocritical or.
So quick to judge others especially.
Younger people because we think we know.
Better and we expect them to grow up the.
Way we grew up but the thing is humanity.
Is constantly evolving and just because.
Things are different whether it's music.
Or toys or trends it doesn't mean that.
They're wrong we didn't grow up the way.
Our parents grew up our parents didn't.
Grow up the way their parents grew up.
And kids today aren't gonna grow up the.
Way that we did let's just keep doing us.
And let them do them some of us will.
Also keep doing them that doesn't sound.
Right so once again thank you guys so.
Much for watching and for all you.
Younger generational kids watching when.
You're our age and you guys want to.
Start hating on the younger generation.
Below you for starting some stupid trend.
Just remember this right here at one.
Point this was the most popular and most.
Talked about thing in the world because.
Of you guys playing with them and.
Enjoying this for fun okay it's your.
Fault.
Kind of mine too i guess.
It's kind of fun damn you kids and your.
No smoking laws and flying skateboards.
And beat bob rock music back in my day.
We had hoverboards that didn't have apes.
That gave everybody a new form of cancer.
And more than anything we had real music.
Like we had like okay well you guys got.
Us on the music.
