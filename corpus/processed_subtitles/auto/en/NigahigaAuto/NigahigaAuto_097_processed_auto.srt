And then i think out that one we would.
We would eat first what guys it's a joke.
Nah david's cannibals leave it in the.
Conscience don't you ever wonder like.
Why don't we eat dogs and cats oh we got.
A clapper claps clapping claps and.
Welcome back to another episode of off.
The pill podcast oh normally park was.
Here he plays this it's fine today we.
Have we have will with okay i'm new here.
Yeah will i and was back and we have.
David who's who's also come back he was.
On a second episode i believe and then i.
Got kicked out yeah he got he got soul.
David david in me up after that have a.
So he's like dude people hate me that's.
What she said people did hate me cuz i.
Was so passionate about apple you well.
There was that and they said and i.
Talked over you yeah i apologize.
Well i mean i don't think you have to.
Apologize at the time the funny thing is.
Like even for me like there's a lot of.
Things i didn't notice i did until we.
Started doing this yeah yeah it's true.
Because no when we normally converse.
It's like we are pretty much talking.
Like over each other all the time but.
You don't really notice it until you.
Watch it on film being on yeah being in.
Front of a camera it's very different.
Than in person mm-hmm right yeah but but.
The thing is like i think a lot of.
People don't realize like they're like.
So irritated that you kept staying on.
That and seeing not like you know maybe.
You had your point of view and it seemed.
Like you weren't you you were trying to.
Prove your point i was trying to prove.
My point and we just kept clashing yeah.
And we talking over each other and i was.
Also low-key trolling just a little bit.
You were trolling in the beginning.
Especially but i think you know well now.
You know that people don't like it you.
Won't like the troll i'm sorry guys i'm.
A naturally i'm gonna comment but you.
Left i wrote i forgot what i wrote like.
I apologize i won't do it again or.
Something like that.
Dude you should do it i should just what.
I should do it again no.
You will probably me they're like damn.
Why is david back on the podcast we.
Don't know that david's actually.
Incredibly funny but he's what do you.
Call that it's just dry like dry humor i.
Have dry humor people think i'm an.
But it's swear look it's so funny like.
How do you explain that like most people.
Like when you first meet david it's like.
You almost have to do a disclaimer i.
Feel like cuz you're so blunt and like.
I'm honest i like to be honest very.
Honest yeah um but i mean it in a i'm.
Honest in a nice i try to be nice yeah.
You got mean em i mean i don't think you.
Know but you do say things out most.
People be like ooh he really said that.
Mean it's true but it's things that.
People are thinking i just say it.
Because i feel like if it's better no.
He's like yeah better to say than to.
Just hide it and pretend that you're not.
Really thinking it that's true.
I guess that's i mean with sometimes i.
Do assume as well that people are.
Thinking something and i say it and then.
I may be wrong what like i didn't we'd.
Roll one again but i mean i just felt.
Like i should have brought that up.
Because thank you last time there was so.
Much negativity and i think people.
Misunderstood you mm-hmm and you were.
Hotted it i mean you you were like.
Actually kind of down from that for a.
Little bit i was a little like you know.
Cuz i have it so i don't know if your.
Your audience knows i i actually also.
Make youtube videos i feel like some.
People don't even know that they.
Probably end up just i mean they know.
They're like well david makes a lot of.
The songs he makes all the bga songs he.
Huichol a black cuz david actually.
Started before me making music and then.
You also dislike mit little like blogs.
And blogs yeah those youtuber youtuber.
I'm one of the earliest actually i.
Talked about on the junior podcast how.
He saw you first and you kind of.
Inspired him hmm.
But you're like you're like grandfather.
Youtube you're like a year before me old.
Guy yeah old man almost i got some white.
Hairs here as you can see but.
Traditionally because your brand is so.
Clean and your musics like really nice.
And it's like weird love like love music.
And hates what it is thanks guys people.
Have always been from what i seen like.
You've i've gotten way more hate than.
You've ever gotten throughout your.
Career.
I think until it's because you have.
2,000 those had i've ever gotten on.
Youtube but fun huh but yeah this cuz.
You had a larger i think like the bigger.
Your audience gets its its but i think.
For the most part you'd get a lot of.
Great comments because you put so much.
Oh yeah i i want to bring this up.
Because i've been watching all the.
Podcasts very closely you you know the.
The one that arden was on the last.
Episode she mentioned how much you work.
To two episodes ago or two episodes yeah.
Yeah that is absolutely true.
I mean for some of the listeners are you.
Bringing that up i mean no because i.
Think like the success that you've had.
On youtube it's because of your work.
Ethic you know just for the listeners i.
Know i come me i come out to ryan's.
House probably once every like once a.
Month once a month then once every two.
Months and you know he wakes up he.
Starts writing and then we eat some.
Lunch and then he goes back to writing.
He does that almost every day if he's.
Not shooting you know i i as a friend.
Want him to have a good life as well so.
I try to you know i'll be like hey look.
Let's go out to let's get some food.
Outside of your home instead of post.
Mating it you're just adding on to what.
Arden said about me i am i have to slit.
A loser that just doesn't leave a loser.
But yes it's true ryan does not leave.
His home wow.
It's hard but you know what your success.
Is deserved well-deserved because you do.
Put so much time and energy to create.
Content for your fans i think it's it's.
A it's that's why that's why you know.
You make great content well thanks well.
Said i think you you tried to shift the.
Focus away from your feelings as we were.
Talking about how you felt when you got.
All that hate for the first time and it.
Also because it also once brings up.
Something me and will we're talking.
About earlier yeah how did that i mean i.
Only really the first time you got that.
Much hate i like fell board yelling at.
You.
Yeah comments i was triggered i was.
Definitely triggered triggered or what.
You said because there's a difference.
Hmm sure thank you felt misunderstood so.
He was a little mad triggers called.
Misunderstood okay yeah i felt that peep.
Like you know the internet's very quick.
To judging you know i consider myself a.
Pretty nice person in general and when a.
Nice person is getting hate you just.
Feel like it's unfair i feel like why.
Why me yeah yeah i do.
Did i kick a dog but the interesting.
Thing is that you're so used to and.
Analytical about being on youtube and.
Understanding how you know even if it's.
A bunch of people it's still a minority.
And people would dislike me you're i was.
Surprised that most times you would just.
Kind of shrug that off because you.
Understand like hates gonna happen yeah.
But i've never seen it happen to you.
That much it's because i've been gone.
From youtube for so long and i forgot.
What it feels like to get hate to get.
Hate let alone that much hate that much.
Hate yeah yeah do you see it from their.
Perspective yeah i agree with a lot of.
Those colors you know so when you say.
Why me it's like okay yeah i mean i'll.
Admit my faults and things that i've.
Done wrong in the past like you know.
Honestly i didn't even notice it me.
Neither watched it back and i was like.
Oh he is kind of doing that after i saw.
The comments i was like oh i didn't even.
Really notice it because that's just how.
We talk yeah me and david we don't like.
Argue but we go we believe in something.
We're not so hard we're not gonna just.
Agree with you to make you feel good.
Yeah i think that's dishonest i agree i.
Think we're both like that yeah.
Very blunt yeah and i disagree with.
Everything you just said right now okay.
There's the troll david coming up and.
All that brings me to what we what we.
Were talking about almost like well we.
Just saw the kevin hart thing on joe.
Rogan he just did this thing you want to.
Bring that up because i thought that was.
Super interesting what we're not yeah i.
Think i just saw today was a on the joe.
Rogan podcast he had kevin hart and.
Kevin hart had a super insightful.
Explanation and like point of view from.
To talk about i don't wanna say it's.
Like being affected by the comments.
Right you know if he has videos online.
Or whatever and he was basically just.
Saying.
I mean he was kind of bagging on people.
That you know comment mean comments.
Essentially yeah in saying you know how.
Do you have so little time or so much.
Time so excuse me so much time to sit.
There and like formulate thoughts and.
Then sit there and type something.
Negative it what's the purpose what's.
The purpose like and especially for.
Someone like kevin hart who never stops.
Working and he's always doing something.
You know his point of view was like.
Really really smart and i really felt it.
Honestly yeah i mean i mean you want to.
Talk about like what he was saying cuz i.
Think it applies to like you know what.
David was saying too but the thing is he.
Gets i think he gets it on such a such a.
Bigger level than any of us right it's.
Like you have to like figure it out at.
Some point or you're gonna go crazy like.
Cuz if you had that every day you would.
Have to figure out how to deal with that.
Or else you'd probably like be depressed.
And kill yourself or you wouldn't make.
Videos altogether like you would be so.
Sad and mad all the time you would ruin.
Your life you would have to figure out.
How to deal with that i mean yeah that's.
Basically what i took from it was just.
Kind of looking at their perspective of.
Like okay it's probably someone who.
Maybe it's a little negative or not.
Doesn't just has a ton of time and.
They're not really working hard on.
Something for on their own side you know.
That's kind of what i took from it and.
To i mean especially for someone like.
You to you're a very busy person to it's.
Like you know i mean yes you got stuff.
To do positive things i focus on and.
Yeah i just felt like he had such a.
Smart like articulate 'iv is that the.
Word heal it responds yeah like his.
Thought about it in such a i don't know.
Such a smart way i mean i did something.
Similar to we've kind of i mean i've not.
Really addressed it in i mean i've said.
It in vlogs before but it's not i didn't.
Make a whole video about it but i mean.
That the reason behind someone leaving.
Something so negative is because i mean.
The reason why anyone does anything is.
For themselves you know like you always.
Do it because you think it's gonna be.
Make you better not a better person just.
Make you feel better or it's it's you.
That's the reason why everyone does.
Everything you want to feel so yourself.
You can yeah yeah so it's even if you.
Make someone mad it'll make you laugh or.
Maybe they're doing it because they want.
They feel so bad about themselves that.
Want other people to feel that pain yeah.
That's what i think because i've felt.
That before i felt like i wanted to.
Leave like a negative comment somewhere.
Just because i'm if i was like that.
Person i know that i would be getting.
These comments and no one's leaving it.
You know like i know if like i said that.
I know i would get these responses.
Negative responses and it makes me want.
To be like man i should get no one.
Saying the negative thing that i know.
That would be said if i said it right.
You know just because they're not.
Popular whatever it is so i mean there.
There's it there i understand it not.
That i would do it and i don't because.
Obviously i i think mature past that but.
I can see if i was a kid that didn't.
Really do youtube and i was like upset.
With my life and i mean it doesn't mean.
It i'm anonymous nobody knows nobody's.
Gonna know right i would write some id.
Probably because i would feel bad for.
I'll be a troll there's power behind you.
Know having the internet in front of you.
Right yeah being unseen and like you.
Said i mean what i wonder from you guys.
Perspective is should people be allowed.
To have but like write bad comments and.
Be trolls yeah what do you mean yes yeah.
Freedom of speech yeah i think there's.
Nothing i mean i don't honestly think.
You people need to understand i think.
You know what the difference is is i.
Grew up playing games and i know you did.
Yeah and it's so filthy like it's like.
The worst things you'll ever hear people.
Who say to you like way worse than some.
Of the click some comments you read that.
You become almost like for me it's like.
Well that's ridiculous is a joke yeah.
Does even hurt me it's so bad that it's.
A joke the ones that really do hurt is.
When it's not necessarily hurt but like.
When it's a critique and it's actually.
Well thought out and it's like man.
That's kind of true there's truth that's.
Where it kind of hurts and i guess.
That's when you get triggered more.
Because it's well thought they like.
Analyze who you are as a person they got.
Deep inside and then they're like oh.
Wait whoa but in a way i don't think.
That's bad either i think that's good.
Yeah sometimes i would agree like i like.
I mean i don't like it but nobody likes.
It but i like critiques constructive.
Calm yeah like i like that's how i.
Learned like i disagree with joe rogan.
He always says don't read the comments.
He tells all his guests like why you.
Guys read the comic don't read tweets.
Don't read the comments i disagree with.
That i think i've learned throughout all.
The years and and tried to improve.
Because of the comments earning like it.
Not taking everything at face value yeah.
Is his perspective is like hey if you're.
Gonna get offended by the comments it's.
Gonna change your comedy and i.
Understand that but you just have to.
Know what to listen to him what not to.
Get what he's coming where he's coming.
From.
But he always instructs his guests like.
And you know people get affected by that.
To not read the comments and i don't.
Really i don't know i don't agree with.
That completely.
So i saw recently that there was a and i.
Need to talk about this because we just.
Flew on it there was a thing about.
Southwest and how was it there well they.
Got their shares got downgraded or.
Something like that because of the.
Recent um was that crash to ethiopian.
Airlines yeah the new so the boeing jet.
Is apparently is the second crash of.
That same type of jet in the same in.
Like fought like less than half a year i.
Know.
And the reason i'm thinking about it is.
Because remember that we just will and i.
Just took a flight to go actually to.
Record with david and we had the crazy i.
Was one of the craziest flights i've.
Ever been on where i felt like it fell.
Like we were on a roller coaster you.
Know when you'd that feeling when you.
Yeah mike right yeah and it was like if.
They like that for a good like sometimes.
At like five second at a time it's like.
We're calling like the seat wasn't like.
We weren't touching the seat it felt.
Like obviously we were right for like 15.
Minutes i would say yeah long constant.
Yeah honson like up and down but there.
Was like some moments where that drop.
Feeling it didn't seem like we were.
Dropping but it you had that feeling of.
Like being in the air for like five.
Seconds at a time i was like this is the.
Craziest thing this is not normal where.
People are sitting out in the plane was.
Some people some kids screaming and like.
There's some people screaming but it was.
A they did warn us and it was super.
Windy so i'm gonna attribute it to that.
You know and ideologically i'm thinking.
I don't normally get bothered by that.
Stuff yeah me neither yeah we know the.
Statistics too like i know that it's.
Like actually don't know the statistics.
But i know it's like million one in a.
Midlife ten million or something like.
That the chance that you're gonna crash.
Right right it's super slim but you.
Think about it every time you fly i'm.
Sure right i think about it not every.
Time i think about every time i fly i.
Mean i don't i don't really think even.
For like a slight second like yeah yeah.
Slight second i'll be like i could down.
This flight but whatever i've had a i've.
Had a flight where now is like.
I wouldn't even like depressed i was.
Just like really not having a good day i.
Was like i don't even care if it crashes.
That's really i really had that damn i.
Was having a very bad day i think it was.
Like girl problems you know what girls.
But i had that feeling i remember.
Thinking and the project won't even care.
If it crashes so tough like that.
The bumpy thing like yeah i said it was.
Super windy i think there is something.
Specific to like our region though that.
Because i think flying in and out of.
Like vegas is pretty notoriously bad.
Right and it's something to do with like.
The temperature different hills yeah and.
We like go over like the hills into.
California or wherever it's never been.
That bad no that was crazy i was bad and.
And then i read this article and i was.
Like okay this is the second one in six.
And it's the same kind of jet right a.
Boeing was a boeing seven was it i don't.
Know you know you know what it is that.
Those jets it's a very common one it's a.
Second crash in five or six months or.
Something like that and what they're.
Seeing is they're stopping production on.
Those jets right now and they're saying.
It because those crashes were attributed.
To all investigators suspect faulty data.
Feeding into the aircraft's automated.
Flight says that's crazy.
Yeah so like who knows like i mean i.
Don't know if i can be talking about.
This guy wants protects protects but i.
Saw this article yeah and i mean would.
You fly south i mean like that's what i.
Fly i'm already flying on it i know this.
Way you know what it's not even about.
The airline because all airlines have.
Boeing's.
Boeing airplanes what's that specific.
One i guess yeah no but the the that.
Specific airplane is sold to southwest.
Yeah yeah you know like all these photos.
Each airline have the same pretty much.
Exactly the same i don't know i think.
They have the exact same planes but like.
For example the boeing 737 most airlines.
Use the 737 mm yeah i think that's what.
It was i think that's the that's the.
Plane they're talking about but like if.
They're having that i mean i never.
Really like even if there are is a plane.
Crashes okay well okay ten million more.
Flights and it won't happen you know.
Another 10 million or whatever that.
Number is but the fact that has happened.
And they're acknowledging there's an.
Actual problem i feel this is the first.
Time i actually feel like dan this is.
Risky.
Yeah and it's such a short period of.
Time five or six months too.
Plane crash just an outlier yeah just.
Makes me feel uneasy i know all the.
People who are about to have a flight.
Coming up sorry yeah let's say you have.
A bike coming up behind jesus look good.
Luck - thanks guys hmm but on a brighter.
Note i don't know that's my wine ted so.
I wanted to crash one time and all these.
Other crashes r.i.p to other people.
There's killed like the whole i think.
Everyone on board like over 100.
Something people wow it's really sad and.
Scary nightmare seriously yeah.
That's your worst nice you know i when.
I'm on the plane there are times are.
Nice you know i've been on like probably.
Hundreds of planes in there are a lot of.
Moments where i'm just thinking what.
What do i do if it crashes into the.
Ocean i've thought - that's a forest.
What if i'm the only one alive i don't.
Know why i think like i'm the only one.
Alive because i guess if you're dead you.
Wouldn't be thinking about it but like.
Yeah you wouldn't even be in that.
Situation right you wouldn't matter.
Right but if you're alive then it.
Doesn't matter because you could still.
Survive tried and iii definitely think.
About that i get really deep like all.
The smokes in in the cargo so i got to.
Like crawl out of the plane and then.
What if i like scraped my knee on a seat.
Bleeding i'm in the forest you guys do.
This like this is this is true i'm not.
Saying this for because it's funny.
Whenever i'm like waiting for my flight.
And people are like lining up and you.
See who's on your flight you guys look.
Around i look around yeah and i'm like.
And i think like if we get started like.
If we're like on loss yeah you know i.
Want that on my tonight yeah i'm like.
See this guy i know he looks just where.
I think about that oh you do everyone.
Does that and then i think oh that one.
We would we would eat first what you go.
In that far i'm uh i think you're making.
A joke man.
I know everyone's gonna think i'm.
Seriously like a couple no see i didn't.
Even know you were joking.
That's joking okay well i'm joking good.
Guys it's a joke.
Nah david's cannibals leaving in the.
College it's i feel like you should.
Strive to be that guy here for now.
Everyone's gonna write david david's a.
Cannibal in the comments but you know.
Why i just told them - why is that gonna.
Hurt you.
Is that gonna hurt your feelings well.
It's better.
Saying that i'm okay david's a.
Cannonball that better get a cannon.
Cannonball cannibal how about a can of.
Balls hey i like that one the best.
You know what i accept that one more.
Than cannibalism because cannibalism is.
Is very you think just i mean like if.
You were in that situation it's not.
Is it wrong to eat someone if you're i.
Mean if you're surviving like it's kind.
Of illegal.
I would assume i in some states don't.
Know the laws on it but i would assume.
Is like i mean if someone had already.
Died right i would assume it's probably.
Illegal yeah i would assume so as well.
I would hope so yeah please don't eat me.
But i give you were if you were say you.
Were surviving on an island and they're.
Like how did you survive in like.
Honestly this guy passed away and we.
Hate him way to jail for that you know.
What it's i don't think it's illegal.
Because i remember no i read an article.
I think i was on vice where a guy had to.
Get his foot amputated and he did a.
Tasting for his friends this is a real.
Thing this is real like yeah she like i.
Think he cooked he probably cooked it on.
Like the stove and this is disgusting.
Tapas is disgusting by he going but like.
He it's on vice you could look it up.
Chopped it off and he did a tasting for.
His friends and i think he made like he.
Saw them skewers yeah yeah of course.
Oh i think they had to sign something.
And people ate it his own foot his foot.
Well it was your own property right he.
Ate his own foot and i said it's not.
Illegal and his friends ate his foot.
It's not illegal well he had them sign.
Something maybe that's the legal.
Document maybe yeah alright so man okay.
Well now we know okay you're we're sorry.
David you can be accountable if you want.
You know what ryan if you had danah.
Balls if you hadn't of like a little.
Tasting event i probably would try a.
Little piece of your you try my foot as.
A friend i would do it why would i'm.
Doing you a favor.
You're not eating my foot like would you.
Will would you eat his foot take a taste.
No i wouldn't maybe smell it you know.
What would i eat it i'd probably smell.
It first you know what you know it's.
Funny though like i saw that this this.
Meme it was kind of like where do you.
Draw the line it's like a picture of.
Like a dog a cat a cow and he was like a.
Vegan thing like well yeah you shouldn't.
Be eating any animals and like where do.
You why do we draw the line at like cats.
And dogs and domesticated animals.
Basically like domesticated animal is.
Yes and then yeah they would live in a.
House and you know with human beings you.
Right so like dogs and cats and like i.
Forget what what else is there like a.
Lizard lizard fish parakeet no parrot.
Fish there on the safe side specific.
Birds other side of the line there's.
Cats and dogs hamsters yeah and then.
Well it made me wonder yeah i mean me.
Wonder like i get we have pets right but.
Like don't you ever wonder like why.
Don't we eat dogs and cats and like i.
Mean like is there there's there actual.
Reason why that happened over time like.
And then why do we eat cows like do you.
Know i mean that's gonna be like a good.
Sound bite right there why don't want.
Eat dogs and cats exactly i didn't want.
To say that but yeah you know i think.
It's more racist stupid racist unlike.
How much time throughout like history.
We've spent with them and so over time.
You know through the domestication of.
Dogs and stuff yeah since we've spent so.
Much time with them they've left kind of.
The realm of our food if that sounds you.
Know if that's okay to say into the.
Realm of helping us i think you know.
Companion companions i always thought it.
Was because they show love like dogs get.
Have like loving like they don't attack.
Us or cows love do they though dude cows.
Are freaking cute.
They like jump in the air and they.
Wiggle and they'll cuddle with you do.
You have a cow no b never seen like.
Those videos of like them like being.
Super cute i lived by a pasture and they.
Were just smelly and i would feed them.
Like tea leaves and stuff and i would.
Keep my distance because they're like.
Drooling and slimy and there's like.
Thousands of flies on them i think i.
Mean i don't want to sound too i don't.
Know i would assume most animals can.
Show compassion in one way or at least.
We can interpret it in compassion and.
Then also right they probably learned.
That over time i'm sure right like.
Yeah i think definitely domesticated.
Animals have early's dogs specifically.
Have learned and what to do to kind of.
Make us evil and evolve that way i think.
So yeah so a dog who wags its tail.
That's been bred more than a dog that.
Doesn't and so that's what has.
Essentially became like oh they're happy.
What i mean is like at what point in.
Time did they say oh these guys are you.
Know let's keep this one as a companion.
This one's to this wolf that's kind of.
Like a dog is not good like this is not.
A good animal too we can still eat that.
Wolf.
That's exactly won't kill this dog why.
We have the dogs just because there was.
Someone that made a decision saying yeah.
This dog didn't bite me but maybe it's.
Because i thought did maybe it's because.
Dogs they tried it eating them and they.
Didn't taste good yes i was gonna say.
That that's probably that's probably a.
Big part of it too but there are places.
In the world where people still do eat.
Canine like yes so then my next question.
Is asia would you guys eat i mean you.
Would clearly try dog and cat i don't i.
Would try i would say what your women.
Before i would try what other cat you.
Really is i don't catch that yeah i.
Don't really believe you there i'm just.
Like would try i would try it i would.
Try because i'm just a very curious.
Person and look if if in the past if a.
Hundred years ago people you know.
Humankind survived because they were.
Eating dogs and cats or whatever animal.
For that matter if that was something.
That kept them nourished and gave him.
Energy to to live life and to procreate.
Then you know what i got a respect that.
And i mean if an alien came down here.
And said well you guys eat these large.
Disgusting animals why do you eat a pig.
That eats its own poop like why are you.
Eating the these dirty dirty animals you.
Know an alien could come down and say.
That and we wouldn't have a good answer.
For it i mean we could say it tastes.
Good but i mean i've never tried dog or.
Cat so i can't say if it tastes good if.
We try and it's really good you know it.
Could be a meow do you think you'd be.
Able to try it um i think if i was in a.
Dire situation i would but i wouldn't.
Want to just for the fact of saying that.
If you know people know that i ate a dog.
Yeah and i have dogs yeah and i think.
That three of us we love dogs i mean i'm.
A huge dog lover i like dogs more than.
People sometimes and like but i would.
Try it out of respect to those who have.
It's like if it's a part of their.
Culture or whatever i would just try it.
But i wouldn't feel good about it.
Because i love dogs i think they're one.
Of the best you know things that the.
World has to offer.
Human beings i don't think i could as.
Much as i kind of want to side on with.
What you're saying is like you're.
Starving well that's completely.
Different i think i think i had like.
That like that the options obviously if.
We're a trip or whatever and it was to.
Not disrespect someone or something i'd.
Have to i don't know i'd have to.
Respectfully decline in the most.
Respectable way that's okay it would.
Yeah yeah i think that's anything that's.
Kind of i think most people wouldn't say.
That but it's different too because some.
People think i'm sure there's people.
Places in the world where some people.
Think how do you eat cows or how do you.
Eat this you know and there it's on the.
Same side they have either like a.
Religious reason or more some really a.
Reason like of morality right and so i.
Don't know.
Who am i to say that they're strong and.
Is that culture you know you know.
Actually though when i hear about like.
Like and see videos of like when those.
Videos trying to make you a vegan yeah.
Yeah yeah like the i think i i agree.
With a lot of their points sure but i.
Think i'm too selfish to give up.
Something i love that much that's a.
Super honest thing to say i'd know i.
Like i agree i'm like this is messed up.
What they're doing to these animals but.
Like because i'm not seeing it every day.
I think that's why like it makes me feel.
Bad right but then i don't change and i.
Think that's selfish but like that's.
Also part of my upbringing like i wasn't.
Taught this.
Had i been taught this from when i was a.
Little kid yeah i think it would be.
Different i think i would have grew up.
Differently i don't know i don't know.
How you guys feel about that but i feel.
Like that's like i agree actually with a.
Lot of what vegans i know you don't.
Necessarily think the same way but i.
Agree with a lot of like thought what do.
You call those big those far that i.
Don't know iii think it's okay to eat.
Meat.
Right i don't think it's okay to do what.
They do to get that me but i know that.
It's necessary to keep humans alive yes.
And no i would i mean if you look at you.
Think don't you think it is necessary in.
Terms of like the food there's already.
People starving and if you were to get.
Rid of that yeah i think it's more so at.
Least the way i look at it is just the.
Way that it's there i think there is a.
Morally sound way to like yes yeah yeah.
Agreed and there are tons it comes to.
People to do it yeah but yeah once you.
Start getting at this mass scale a lot.
Of those things that i value they the.
Importance of them goes down and so i.
Mean when i comes in like me my own.
Personal opinion on it i don't really.
Buy like those you know the the wrapped.
Meats in the store because i really want.
To have at least some sense of like okay.
I know where this steak is coming from.
Alright know like what the conditions.
Are you know and i think that you know.
You have a choice and you're absolutely.
You're exercising the choice and i think.
The markets if enough people make the.
Same decision that as you do they say i.
Don't want this like mass-produced.
Whatever meat i want this meat that was.
You know where the animals were treated.
Better right i think if more if a lot of.
People request that the market will.
Adjust to it you know before people.
Didn't care about organic stuff now they.
Do because people are requesting it and.
Also it's in terms of like the right way.
Of treating animals you know to turn.
Them into food i think any way you do it.
I mean there are better ways and then.
You know yeah it's not but it's always.
Yes it's always gonna be brutal at the.
End of the day because you're killing an.
Animal sure you look at the animal.
Kingdom you know a tiger you know.
Attacks a deer it's gruesome it's it is.
Oh no and in that's just the circle of.
Life and you know we need to eat yeah.
And but the difference is though that.
The deer has an opportunity to get away.
Right yeah the deer isn't isn't you're.
Not putting the deer in a cage and then.
Sending a tiger into the k.
Sure so i mean not that the deer will.
Get away i'm just saying like it's a.
Little different because their whole.
Life i think that's what people are.
That's the inhumane part about it it's.
Like like if they didn't have brains or.
Thought or feelings or anything i think.
It'd be fine for people yeah it was just.
A slab of meat that grows bigger with no.
Consciousness but i think a lot of you.
Know the hardcore vegans you know peta.
They don't even want you to even kill.
Any animal no yeah i know i know but i.
Don't i don't necessarily agree with.
That but i do agree with it.
I mean slaughterhouses and stuff like.
That i mean you see that they're not.
Going through pain and production yeah.
So there's better ways you could.
Probably do that and that's not as.
Natural but i also understand i've seen.
The argument on the other side like what.
People would starve yeah i don't know if.
That's true but i mean i could pay i.
Understand yeah it could be.
We don't really so the funny thing is.
That people get so upset and triggered.
Over things like this right and that's.
Why i'm trying to be a little careful.
But in all reality and i thought about.
This before all these like issues we.
Have with if you really break bring it.
Back to its foundation and i always.
Think like this is i know it's not good.
But if you really bring everything back.
In like if there was war if there if.
There was chaos if there was an alien.
Abduction abduction alien invasion and.
We're so we're trying to survive.
Nobody's gonna care like if your people.
Are starving we're just fortunate we're.
In a fortunate enough place in life to.
Worry about these little miniscule.
Things not saying that it's miniscule.
Right but like if like    was going.
Down right and everyone's trying to.
Survive and it's every man for themself.
Right there's chaos world is ending we.
Would not those same people would not be.
Like hey we can't i don't think i don't.
Think so i don't think they'd be focused.
On surviving yeah yessuh cumin need they.
Could still be vegan yeah but they.
Wouldn't be like hey you shouldn't do.
That mm-hmm you know yeah we live in a.
Society where were we have the luxury of.
Making just like you know decisions of.
First world problem decisions like you.
Know oh i don't like the color of this.
Whatever like organic first gmo yeah.
Yours like give to give the people and.
Walking dead like gmos you know like in.
That world.
Gmo genetically modified you know that.
Option of having food like constant food.
Coming in right and then raising cattle.
And then putting it i mean.
Cages and stuff so that they can get.
Food you wouldn't say like oh my gosh.
You're immoral you'd be like they're.
Trying to survive yeah right but that's.
I mean we're in a place where we're.
Lucky enough we don't need that that's.
Why we can complain about it yeah i mean.
Everyone's gotta eat.
And everyone's gotta pee so on that you.
Should pick it up shishi break you.
Halfway.
Yep all right i guess well you wanna.
Send us off.
Music.

The guys who paved the way to making.
Asians the asian stereotype of martial.
Large stronger than ever yeah so it says.
How it says all these assault no i bet.
No but it's all seriousness he i think.
He really paved the way for you know.
People to really you know see that there.
Are some asian american actors that can.
Have a successful film oh yeah he also.
Bridge the gap between you know he.
Played his part in bridging the gap.
Between asian-americans and the black.
Community through chris tucker in that.
Movie and his movies were funny they.
Were a great wall they were it was just.
So many like and it was i love jackie.
Chan movies immensely yeah some of my.
Favorite so chris tucker said a fourth.
Film was definitely possible possibility.
They didn't say they're doing it it's.
Not in pre-production they're working on.
A few things for the script so they are.
Working on something but he said jackie.
Chan wants to do it he wants to do it.
And the studio wants to do it so it's.
Gonna happen.
Oh most likely that's awesome dude that.
Is awesome a lot of respect for 65 year.
Old to do stunts like that and he.
Doesn't own stunts that's also like who.
Does that anymore yes tom cruise but.
Yeah that's true that is true do you.

Master uh i thought that was bruce lee.
No dude.
Legend of the drunken master he's like.
This i didn't see that his dad is like a.
Kung-fu master and then he like learns.
His other stuff i think i saw jackie.
Chan later in his career like when he.
Was doing funny things not just action.
No they were funny oh really they were.
Really funny he's always been every.
Movie he's always but like this little.
Sense of cute what.
Humor is what i was in say in comedy i.
Was combining those two words and then.
Just in crazy crazy amount of stunts in.
Action but i would go back and watch i.
Was ever.
Really good i would say my favorite.
Meeting think of that the movies no.
Jackie chan i didn't bring it up oh yeah.
Want me to oh you just thought you just.
Just thought of it as topical can i just.
Out a driveway you know yeah so makes.
You feel kind of old yourself to think.
Like wow this guy's been around that.
Long.
Yes still doing things oh you know what.
He played the um using karate kid' the.
New one i didn't actually see that one.
Was it good.
Yeah that would jeans oh like when jaden.
Smith yeah mm-hmm wait sorry i was.
Thinking at cobra kai that's good we're.
All on three different what happened.
During this you see all right sink each.
Other ready hands in yeah we're back in.
Sync to shi shi and we're back because.
You guys said it wrong that's why sorry.
We got distracted during the shi shi.
Break because one of my fish has a.
Bubble by its blood dude congratulations.
Ryan thanks man.
So what am i have a guppy i have a lot.
Of copies but they're in this big tank.
And one of them is giving birth and i.
Never i never see it i never see it.
Happening and i finally there's like a.
Little bubble there so it's like the sac.
Thing coming out and we were just.
Waiting for it and it's not happening.
But at the same time you don't want to.
Miss it i don't want to miss it because.
You've never seen every single other.
Yeah i just see the babies if you see.
The babies i'm like when does this.
Happen as the first time i'm seeing it.
Happening we're here how to do rate this.
Podcast you're missing your grand rifice.
You're making that your grin my grand.
Grand fish grandkids you know what.
Though i'm not i'd still eat fish there.
You go and i love fish.
Boom i love fish yeah i'd still eat it.
You ate it last night.
I did we have sushi you know sorry to.
The vegan people they probably could.
Either only fix meat or fish what would.
You pick for us your life boom go sheet.
Meat yeah because then i would have to.
Eat i think you would pick fish no i.
Just well i mean other than sushi like.
What you don't know i know but doesn't.
Meet is like burgers and like steak.
That's true and like covers a much wider.
Like there's more possible yeah but fish.
Is healthier for you yeah what would you.
Choose i don't know that meat guy i do.
Like me but i do like i mean eating fish.
Is i feel like it's good for you people.
It is cultures that eat a lot of fish.
Are usually pretty live longer.
But the fish that we have now there's.
Too much mercury in it you think so.
For sure like there's a lot of fish in.
Every ocean or is it only specific.
Oceans how do you know i'm not an expert.
But i know that when people eat too much.
Fish yeah they they get mercury.
Poisoning mmm it happens a lot you know.
In the same way that like i was saying.
Like i don't get to see the negative.
Parts of like you know like the.
Slaughtering of animals all the time so.
I kind of you kind of don't think about.
It yeah and you kind of like it's kind.
Of selfish but at the same time you it's.
Understandable like if you don't see.
Something that often you're not gonna be.
Thinking about it all the time your.
Disconnect yeah.
So i also heard like back when there was.
A tsunami in japan that you know all.
That radioactive material went into the.
Water and it was constantly spreading.
Further and further and further i.
Remember like there's said so many years.
From now every fish that's important.
From there that you're eating is gonna.
Be in fact like not in fact radio a.
Creation and i remember hearing like.
Okay this is already happening and i've.
Been eating fish i haven't changed i.
Haven't changed because i haven't but if.
I read an article like today i'll.
Probably like oh maybe i won't eat sushi.
Today but i'll probably eat it like in.
The week yeah it's the same concept it's.
Like we just forget and like i mean i do.
At least that's the power of media i.
Mean they can you know when you're yeah.
You can change corporation like that you.
Just told people hey this is this is a.
Story we want to put out we want to put.
An emphasis on the fact that we're.
Cleaning it up you know the radiation in.
The in the ocean as opposed to them.
Coming up with the story this radiation.
Is starting to affect everyone's fish.
Yeah like that's that's the power that.
Like big corporations have yeah and a.
Separate no but it's related to what.
You're talking about earlier is people.
Don't really care about the lives of.
Fish which is kind of crazy yeah yeah in.
Terms of like when we were tank talking.
About drawing the line right animals and.
Mammals like they're very heavily they.
Have emotions they have feelings.
Blah blah blah and that kind of stuff.
Right yep fish i don't it's very rare to.
Have someone i feel like defend fish in.
That way because like when i started.
Fishing that was one thing i was like.
How do i dispose of the fish like in a.
In a moral way right.
And like some people say like hit it.
Over the head right and it'll just knock.
Its lights out and whether or not that's.
You know well or insane however some.
People just throw it in a bucket and.
Let's let it suffocate i think was water.
Don't scream or make noise that's yeah i.
Think that's what it can can't relate to.
It as much and they're also in the water.
So we don't see them all the time right.
As imagine if you if you were to catch a.
Cow right by shoving a hook through its.
Through its mouth and like hooked onto.
Its mouth and it was like going crazy.
And screaming you'd be like damn this is.
Hard to watch.
Yeah with a fish just like oh it's.
Flopping around cute you know like oh.
You caught a fish yay it's no actually.
When i see fish and see the blood coming.
Out actually i still kind of like feel.
Bad for oh i do too that knows like when.
I started fishing i kind of was like i.
Need to figure out a way of like how to.
Morally dispose after i catch anyone ii.
Want to eat it right yeah i mean if we.
Were to ask the fish what do you think.
The fish would say what if the fish said.
You know actually the best thing for me.
Is you probably should cut off my fin.
First i prefer like it's like it's like.
Asking someone you know like imagine if.
The fish could talk yeah what if there.
Is a way to morally do it at the fish.
Nose that's the least painful that'd be.
Like someone asking you i'm gonna eat.
You what how do you want me to kill you.
Yeah or is it like brain what if this is.
Right what if by hitting it in the head.
What your being with your act what if.
You're stimulating something in the fish.
Or like knocking it out but they can.
Still feel mm-hmm yeah that's scary well.
Regardless i mean it's i mean i think.
It's it people don't feel a certain way.
About fish for that exact reason though.
Still right or maybe it's a cold-blooded.
Thing cuz people don't care as much.
About reptiles ulua true yeah get um.
Cold blood get on and we're cold blooded.
Damn we gonna wish just grab the fish by.
The sleeves never your eye that was a.
Comment you said earlier i'm cold.
Yeah we're cold-blooded yeah well i.
Should have brought that up in the.
Beginning one of my favorite comments i.
Read on one of the last podcast i don't.
Remember it specifically but it said.
Something along the lines of how i.
Always wear a sweater right.
I like wearing sweaters but and i'm look.
Cozy and warm and then he pan over a.
Ryan sure he's like look sweaty and the.
Comment was like i just am so confused.
On what the temperature is in this room.
Yeah people thought we might be either.
In different rooms or how big is this.
Room like it's not that big once i let.
Me say is it's cold it is cold here ryan.
Can handle the cold like a champion like.
It'll be love that's super cold outside.
He's like wearing a t-shirt i'm like.
You're definitely cool he's like no i'm.
Not i'm sweating yeah always like oh.
What are you trying to be tough no i.
Love the code and people like oh where.
Are you from like hawaii and like what.
That doesn't make sense and here's my.
Explanation for that and you grow up in.
Hawaii at least for me i grew up it's so.
Hot there right and there's no ac all.
The sweating yeah like all the time most.
Of the time it's hot and it's the most.
Uncomfortable thing that it's so like.
Humid people in singapore you guys can.
Probably relate except you guys are rich.
Enough to have ac i didn't have ac it.
Was horrible the only time it felt great.
Is when you walked into like.
Supermarkets or like places that were.
Cold and it was such a luxury i had one.
Friend who had ac and they were like.
Rich and i was always like so excited to.
Go to their house cuz it was so nice to.
Just step in there and ever since then i.
Guess i grew up just appreciating the.
Cold yeah was it a do you think growing.
Up was it a thing of money to have an ac.
Or was it just the homes like maybe when.
Your parents bought homes back in the.
Day maybe it was just like people didn't.
Think they needed ac is because it was.
Like cool like i mean we were we were.
Like not rich we were like i would say.
Like middle-class we weren't poor we.
Were a middle class i would say and they.
Still would my parents to say like.
That's a waste of money yeah and i.
Actually ended up i ended up getting.
Them ac yeah but my mom was like i don't.
We don't need that room so it's just in.
The living room and in my bedroom so.
When i go back check the ones that are.
On the wall but it's it's i don't know.
Yeah it was still considered i think it.
Expensive it's like a waste of money so.
Example but it's sobering it was a.
Luxury yeah and i think that's why i.
Love the cold yeah and also i sweat easy.
You know what shawne's the same way and.
He's from hawaii he is i'm onto.
Something.
Damn hey if there are any hawaiians out.
There do you like the cold i mean i.
Think i think that's i mean that's why.
People think oh you're from hawaii you.
Should like the warmth ya know i think.
Like people who grow up in like really.
Cold like minnesota right you you would.
Like the warmth because you hate the.
Code there right yeah that's why a lot.
Of people when they move if they move.
From the midwest or something or.
Somewhere where it's really cold they.
Have harsh winters they moved like.
California they're like oh my god the.
Weather i mean it is nice but you.
Singaporeans are like me cuz it's so hot.
They just love the cold but the thing is.
They have ac you might be onto.
Something here i might be.
Could you imagine not having ac in las.
Vegas we would probably be dead you die.
Do you really think about it if if.
Went down right and electricity got cut.
Out.
I think we're dead we were just talking.
About that yeah what would happen like.
We would i mean during the summer it.
Hits like 115 degrees 120 sometimes and.
We're in the middle of the desert like.
If there was like a apocalypse right and.
We're all locked in here we we'd be dead.
During the summer what would you do.
There's nothing like how would we.
Survive you would have to find just some.
Shade or some water or something that's.
What they did back then yeah i mean they.
People didn't want to live and didn't.
Live in the desert back then we got.
Tricked into living out here people do i.
Mean that's how we're that's how.
Humanity you know came living with us.
Today well they had to live through it i.
Mean i mean they went through it but.
They're not like hey let's settle right.
Here and it all shows the human spirit.
I wonder how fast we could adjust our.
That we have like a kid who was born.
Into a climate and then it raised their.
Whole life but if if all of a sudden.
Everything just like all our luxuries.
Got shut off.
I wonder how fast we would adjust to.
Like our environment and would we evolve.
As humans would the the next generation.
Of kids be have like really hot skin oh.
And their well their body temperatures.
Would be at naturally at 105 oh.
Instead of 98.6 i don't know damn we'll.
Never know i don't know why i brought.
That up oh you know why i brought that.
Up that's because we were listening to a.
Book called cd games and that was i was.
Pretty um highly recommend it was a long.
Drive it was really cool it was super.
Interesting it was good but if you would.
Have saw us.
From an outside perspective like three.
Guys just sitting there listening to.
This book that sounds like a british.
Lecture from like a college you'd be.
Like oh let's get doing we do for fun we.
Were like genuinely into it no i mean i.
Thought it was super super intriguing.
That was really cool and i and then made.
Me think like when people listen to this.
Podcast they're not really getting that.
Much right like we're just talking about.
Like i learned a lot what did you learn.
Lean one thing you learned from this.
Podcast see maybe we need to start like.
Going at school reading more yeah become.
Scholars you know we should do is listen.
To more like educational stuff and then.
Will regurgitate in a dumb way for dumb.
People because i don't like listening to.
Smart people talk it gets boring you.
Know because i'm not smart my first.
Lesson today two plus two equals four i.
Mean when i say dumb i mean like thanks.
For coming to my ted talk when i said no.
I don't mean like we don't think i just.
Mean we're not necessarily harvard grads.
Yeah you know like yeah duh you dropped.
Out right so yeah i got accepted to usc.
And i was gonna go for music business.
Right and then that was a time i got.
Signed to a publishing deal for at a.
Company called warnerchappell music and.
I ate so i chose that and i dropped out.
Because i wanted to pursue youtube mhm.
And will dropped out as well you did.
Yeah we are three dumb dummies and then.
We're the bird themed boys anyone's.
Listening to right now we will do our.
Best to get more educational things and.
Dumb it down for you naturally i thought.
You guys are dumb it's cuz we're dumb we.
Are dumb yeah but we'll make it fun try.
It so what do we learn from sapiens that.
Humans are strong that's not oh you mean.
The the book yeah i feel like i learned.
Actually a lot i nearly thought about.
How there was multiple species of like.
Quote-unquote humans that one yeah i.
Think that one yeah and then what we are.
Today is homo sapiens but there was like.
The neander.
Dolls or neanderthals that's how you.
Pronounced it yeah and like all these.
Other ones and we know ones that.
Survived yeah we don't really know i.
Don't think how we became the last ones.
To survive there he was definitely pecks.
Predators yeah he was saying that could.
Have been like we could have hope.
Extinguished that or iphone in time oh.
Was that because and this is the this is.
The only thing i really took a not that.
I to only took away this but i thought.
It was so interesting that how he was.
Saying we've evolved so that our brains.
Are bigger than like apes right and the.
Reason the reason why we're so weak is.
Because our brains are so big and it.
Requires so much energy we compared to.
The the chimpanzees and the apes they're.
Exactly yeah.
Yeah and he was saying that um and what.
What made us talk he didn't say this.
This is or us you know hearing that and.
Going on you know how they draw aliens.
And they show aliens like your.
Stereotypical alien has a gigantic head.
And a smaller body right and you know.
You know that's your stereotypical alien.
A small body gigantic head at least.
That's what we hear it if you think.
About it what if they're just the.
Evolved versions of humans because i.
Mean there's a conspiracy theory already.
That that's what it is.
Yeah aliens are just super evolved.
Humans as you see time it's like my.
Favorite yeah it's like battle of the.
Minds as opposed to physical story right.
Which is like what animals have - it's.
All based off of speed and strength.
Right right with human beings we've come.
To evolve to become a society where we.
Don't need to actually physically fight.
Yeah because we're smart.
These are dominant we have we learn that.
Our brains make us the most powerful.
Thing because we can shoot we invented.
Guns we can shoot an ape whereas if we.
Didn't have if we're going one-on-one in.
The physical battle that hate would tear.
Us apart yeah but because of our brains.
Is the most powerful gift that's but.
That also is why we're so physically.
Weak there's no thing that's as strong.
As an ape and as smart as a human.
Because it would be too much energy to.
Repower that brain yeah something like.
That yeah so what if so aliens you know.
What that means.
Well kick some alien ass physically but.
Then they'd probably have super guns and.
Then super shoot us.
Yeah i mean for all we know they're.
Already we're already in they're gone.
We're in their world that they created.
That's like her dummy homo sapien way.
They got super gonna shoot us you know.
What we're bringing we're gonna listen.
To more and we will update you guys i.
Think it's been like yeah i really think.
Oh but you're leaving hey you got to.
Come back i'll be back someday yeah you.
Gotta breathe we gotta get more negative.
Yes guys leave some negative comments.
For david please was it david cannibal.
Cannibal i'm just a sack of canned balls.
You didn't have to take it there but.
Alright sorry guys i really think we.
Should we should learn more so that we.
Can be we gotta get better at this we.
Got to have you got to help educate our.
Listeners yeah i realize i feel like uh.
As we do the podcast i realize that.
Being able to like conversate and watch.
It back it's pretty crazy like how you.
Say like i feel like paco naturally is a.
Good comping a conversation and speaking.
And something that i loves to talk he.
Loves to talk and i feel like it's it's.
Hard it's a hard to generate entertainer.
Yeah yeah yeah yeah that's is that's why.
I mean that's out of everybody in noir.
Hpc i was like he needs to be on it cuz.
This is his gift yes not necessarily.
Like oh i'll write a skit for him sure.
He'll do it he's he would want to do it.
His own way but when he's just being him.
Like that's best yeah not when he's like.
Not trying to make you laugh it's funny.
To me and you can see it through the.
Podcasts because that's essentially what.
I think he would love to hear us saying.
This type of thing forward.
He ain't gonna watch this you think you.
Need to watch this he i don't think you.
I mean if he does he knows that we're.
Ending since he probably would have.
Skipped it like the ending alright miss.
You paco you're a great person.
Yeah he's well he comes back tomorrow.
From japan yeah or not tomorrow i guess.
When this comes out he just came back.
Yep um i guess yeah what that being said.
And wrap this up but i do think man i.
Wish and we brought this up earlier what.
Huh.
The whole alien thing because i think.
That's we're on to something i think so.
