Can we got popular for sex tape i got.
Famous off of a booty pick on history.
Everyone's human i have days where i.
Wake up and i feel this disgusting and.
Fat i like you at myself you know i.
Looking at me on like disgusting damn.
Christian baja but i think no that works.
Alright we're just gonna start with this.
And we don't need the intro song welcome.
Back to another episode about the peel.
Podcast i got david with me in the.
Moderator see we got paco right here i'm.
Ryan and we have a very special guest.
Miss summer rae.
So some for people who don't know on.
Instagram you have 2.20 1.8 million.
Followers and on youtube 1.5 million.
Subscribers but you were on instagram.
First youtube just to kind of mess.
Around with it i did it for like six.
Months and then i stopped doing it like.
Just cold turkey just stopped i'm trying.
To do it again because i feel like that.
Was like the most like authentic fanbase.
Ever like instagram it's just not the.
Same so i was like i need to get back to.
You so you actually see the difference.
Between the two yeah well like what it.
Is exactly yeah why is it more engaging.
On youtube than instagram i think is.
Because like on instagram.
You just sir on there you like scroll.
You see a picture you think of girls ha.
Blah.
You don't like know them you don't know.
Anything about them you know on youtube.
You go on you watch someone you could be.
In your room watch these kids are in the.
Room watching you for hours like they.
Know everything about you they're so.
Connected to you like i've had kids come.
Up to me and say things my home why do i.
Know you like it's so weird but like on.
Instagram before i did youtube it's not.
Like that it's just like they recognize.
You but they don't know you and it's.
Like more of like a personal connection.
That i like right but you did it for.
Like six months and you stopped is it.
Because you what burnout or what um i.
Don't know i just like i don't think i'm.
A great youtuber so i don't really know.
I don't know what to do on youtube i'm.
Like.
They want to see like cuz i would do.
Vlogs but like i had friends or.
Youtubers and it was kind of fun to like.
Just do it with them but i find myself.
I'm like what do they want to see so now.
I'm starting to do like more fitness.
Stuff i want to like do like fitness.
Fridays and i want to like show them.
Like like i feel like no one really.
Knows me as a part like even on my.
Youtube channel i just was like messing.
Around like i knew i want people to like.
Like get to know me as like a person.
Yeah but that's what i mean you said.
You're thinking about starting again oh.
I'm just starting again but it's so.
Weird cause if you're not consistent the.
Views go yep.
Oh way and they don't come back you have.
To like work it from scratch again i'm.
Like damn it and i just have to like not.
Care about music who cares about you.
Guys i mean we care a little bit but you.
Know you just have let that you go down.
Go and be like i don't care    usually.
The people are able to say who cares.
About the views get good enough use.
Usually oh mine are sucking right now.
Yeah pretty bad but it's fine it's all.
Relative right yeah i'm not a youtuber.
I'm just doing it for fun right what do.
You consider yourself ah i don't know i.
Hate when people say i g model like it's.
Not that i don't like this not that i.
One um like cuz i feel like i've like.
Really been like a big part of the.
Making instagram models i have been an.
Instagram model forever i'm like an og.
Instagram model but now what girls post.
On instagram i don't like to be.
Associated with it like no one has any.
Respect for themselves they post the.
Most raunchy things i'm just like okay i.
Don't like instagram model now because.
It's like no respect like obviously i.
Post pictures on my body but i have.
Respect for myself and there's certain.
Things that i just wants the line that.
You don't cross like i don't do like new.
Like i hardly do any like implied like.
Girls are literally posting but i saw.
This girl like her whole page she's just.
Like posting pictures of her she puts a.
Little thing over her nipples like in.
Her vagina like naked cuz i'm like i.
Just can't like it's like there's a fine.
Line there's like classy like i work.
Hard for my body i'm gonna show it off.
Because i mean i got me where i am today.
And like but there's a fine line of just.
Like you go to their page you're like.
Okay this is too much like i won't want.
My mom seen this was porn right yeah.
It's like porn so a lot of things like i.
Think i don't like being called.
Instagram model because there's no.
Respect you know it's like i deserve.
Respects you guys come on well you said.
You that you don't want you there's some.
Things you're you wouldn't want your mom.
To see yeah and i mean how do you feel.
About the current stuff that you're.
Posting right well they are they cool.
With it like funny because i actually.
When i was a kid i'm from 16 to 18 i was.
A bodybuilder like bikini so i'm in a.
Bikini on stage in my dad's my coach so.
I literally would be posing and all this.
Kinda stuff in a tiny bikini he's my dad.
And it's not a sexual thing like when.
You're in that industry and stuff it's a.
Whole like world and it's not like it's.
Not gross it's not sexual it's this is.
My body this is heart like i've sculpted.
My body to look this way it's like that.
It's so i've been raised in a different.
Way to view bodies like i view bodies as.
Art like i don't view it like i've never.
Even watched porn like i've never been.
On i don't like i wanna watch porn.
People are probably like a liar i'm like.
No i really have never watched porn and.
By accident while on twitter i'm like oh.
My gosh.
But yeah i've just like been raised not.
To think of the human body like how.
People like think of it you know people.
Think of a naked body whatever like oh i.
Wanna never i wanna i think wow that.
Probably took a lot of hard work in the.
Gym like you know so it's like a.
Different way to look at it like i i.
Mean i saw a video i'm not sure where it.
Was from i can't remember but you said.
Something about like you really like.
Enjoy eating but that's why you work out.
Yeah so i think life is really short so.
Why i have those views is because i used.
To compete 16 to 18 like a cheap meal.
Would be having a protein bar like that.
Is like okay like having a like lily.
Your diet has to be so strict you have.
Camp any fatty or whatever and like mike.
I was so young and my quality of life.
Sucked like i was just like wow like.
Every side like i got into like an.
Eating disorder like like messed up my.
Mind with food and everything because.
It's like it was really like.
Traumatizing and now i just moderation.
That's my thing there's a balance like.
I'm not just gonna eat cheeseburgers.
Every day have fun i'm gonna have a.
Cheeseburger and then i'm a salad it's.
Called balance so often though we're.
Coping you probably work out like every.
Day right yeah i try to work out every.
Day i mean i used to be really really.
Consistent but like i'm so busy now the.
Like sometimes i get off-track but yeah.
I mean ally i eat what i want but the.
I'm also blessed with a good metabolism.
Cuz like i can really eat what i want.
And i burn it off really quick but yeah.
I think that everybody is different in.
Somebody some people like can't eat what.
They want because they gain weight and.
Stuff so it's just like to eat teach.
Their own you know it's like everyone's.
Different but i just live my truth like.
People don't want you to live your life.
Like you say like no you can't get.
That's like no i'm doing i'm not saying.
You can't do it or can do it i'm saying.
This is what i do i mean so you you said.
You wanted to get into wellness and what.
Was it fitness and stuff and yeah i mean.
A channel oh yeah like i like came like.

You.
I mean i'm gonna just assume you have.
Some pretty crazy stories there right.
That's a shock.
Cuz every girl we've had on here has had.
Their own story and especially for you i.
Would feel like you would have some.
Pretty crazy stalker stories or.
Something like some some really weird.
Fan experiences.
Yeah like sliding people weird people.
Sliding in stuff like that but i think i.
Just don't even think about it just like.
That was weird yeah it's hard i've been.
So often it's just like i don't even.
Know what is weird like maybe like some.
Of the stories i thought girls would say.
I'm like that's not weird that happens.
To me every day yeah.
Are you or were you at living at the.
Cloud house mm-hmm so your current is.
That where you're currently yet no so.
That's when i lived in hollywood i live.
With them it's so funny because everyone.
Thinks it as a cloud house so actually.
Brian rice is what i'm like like really.
Early good friends like when we first.
Kind of started popping off on the.
Internet we like met up and we like just.
Really been like really good friends.
Since then so a few years ago like a.
Year ago maybe almost two yeah two years.
Ago it's crazy time flies he hit me up.
And he was like hey i'm moving into this.
House like we're looking for some.
Influencers if you want to come live.
With us and i was like i was already.
Living summer at the time so i just.
Couldn't but then it was weird cuz a.
Couple months went by and i actually.
Needed somewhere to live i'd even think.
About it again but he called me again.
And asked me i was like oh yeah actually.
Well so the time i was only him and.
Ricky banks and.
Yeah i was me him and and then that's.
Before like alyssa like started dating.
Him around that time it didn't really.
Live there were just like stay there all.
The time and then she moved in and then.
It like kind of formed into a class.
House but everyone thinks i like moved.
Into the class house and it i had to.
Look up what that was.
Oh oh you know brian yeah well yeah so.
We met up before he moved out there we.
Need hang out a lot we played basketball.
And stuff like that but yeah okay well.
That's good to know i thought we were.
Just wondering you're like one of the.
Founding fathers of it than in the way.
Yeah no one really does anything with it.
Anymore like clubhouse but i mean the.
Clock and also like the phase house you.
Know like phase yeah yeah but yeah those.
Are like i love them like family so i.
Just moved out because i have so much.
Crap that i was like i don't have enough.
Room for this stuff so just because just.
Because it was tweeted to us a lot.
Mm-hmm.
Did you and brian ever everything it's.
So funny cuz everyone thinks that yeah.
But you know he needs to do it for the.
The views he would like kind of make it.
Seem so he would like put in the.
Thumbnail like me and my girlfriend and.
Then in the description it would be.
Because she's my friend and she's a girl.
But no one would catch that you know.
Right you wanted to kind of like click.
Bake that like we're dating we've never.
Had a thing we've it's like literally.
He's like a brother to me like i've said.
That so many times in videos your videos.
Your brother to me but it's like i mean.
I just me if people like but helps with.
The views helps with the views you know.
If some kids want to carry on the rest.
Of their life thinking that we are.
Boyfriendgirlfriend so be it but yeah.
It's not true open are you about that.
Part of your life.
I like relationships an instagram i mean.
You can show what you want to show right.
Yeah am i like um like i always say like.
Things i really really care about things.
Are the most important to me that i love.
I like to keep private because people.
Like to get involved they like to like.
Kill your happiness like true so it's.
Like if they don't what they don't know.
About they can't mingle with or like try.
To kill so that's a very private and.
You're you're actually uh i guess kind.
Of younger like you're 22 yeah how long.
Have you been doing this cuz you.
Kind of started pretty early in yeah.
Like four years ago like that's like.
Four or five years ago like probably i.
Don't know guys.
Time flies flies by i'm like what i was.
Like i started when i was like 17 18 and.
Now i'm 22 so but i didn't like really.
Start like getting popular until i was.
Like 18 19 wow did that change like what.
Changed what what made you pop off ah at.
One moment or is it gradual i like.
That's before i moved to la and stuff.
And i started working with photographers.
I got something like really viral.
Content like the stuff i was posting all.
When like viral and stuff and i don't.
Know i think that people just like liked.
The naturalness about me and like my.
Booty and everything like a lot of girls.
That were on instagram like not doing.
Like the fitness i like booty stuff that.
I was doing but they're like everyone.
Has fake boobs fake everything fake.
Slips it's like i'm just like.
Authentically me and like i've always.
Been i feel like people can see that and.
I think they just liked it and yeah i.
Always liked booty stuff is out so weird.
But it's like i work really hard for my.
Video okay i that's like my like my.
Struggle is like i don't ever i don't.
Want to be like girl or whatever but.
That is just like but that's like that's.
Like a guys pecs in it yeah but i can't.
Step away from like what got me popular.
I mean kim got popular off a sex tape i.
Got famous off of a booty pic on.
Instagram it's fine that you worked hard.
For it looked hard for it okay yeah i.
Got these games kay wow issue with it i.
Mean i think that it's in my head cuz.
You're coming in to other people right.
Yeah like i look at other girls and i'm.
Like i hope people don't think of me.
Like all right so if there's a younger.
Let's say someone i guess we were 17.
When you started someone like a 17 year.
Old who wants to follow that path what.
Would you say to them i would say just.
Like stay - oh my my advice is like see.
Authentic to you so that really is your.
Goal and you literally love working out.
And you really like like if that's what.
You love and you're not doing it because.
You saw someone do it and got popular.
Off of it but it's because you want to.
Do it because when i did it i didn't see.
Anyone do it and be like oh i want to.
Copy that and follow that and do it i.
Didn't know what it was gonna be i was.
Just doing what i love and posting it on.
The internet posting my pictures of.
Working out and stuff and it turned into.
This so it wasn't like i saw someone.
And i was like i'm gonna do that you.
Know so it's like i think the real like.
Pioneers in life are the originators who.
Like create and like try it like do.
Something that you're really passionate.
About that is new and like original and.
That's how you succeed so i agree with.
That totally like i think the only way.
To become as because you have on.
Instagram is like you just said.
Originators ten years you did your own.
Thing you didn't really imitate others.
Yeah they're people on the platform.
That's my thing my whole messaging is.
Like be you and it's like because i.
Always see girls always like copying.
Everyone copying me and it's not.
Anything like i just feel bad for them.
Because it's like i just want them to.
Like find themselves and like just.
Embrace who they are because if you're.
Always gonna be copying people you're.
Always gonna change you're never gonna.
Know who you are because that girl that.
You're obsessing over right now.
Might change next year you're gonna be.
Another girl it's like it's like be you.
Like you can find inspiration like.
Obviously what i have done and graded.
It's not like i'm the only one who can.
Do it it's just like put your own twist.
On it do different things like don't.
Copy like you can find inspiration but.
It's different you know when you say.
People copying you what exactly do you.
What can you like specify on like what.
Specific thing it's not really copying.
Or whatever but you know like i i was.
One of the first like girls on the.
Internet who posted pictures of her body.
On instagram you know and i like there.
Was other girls doing it like booty pics.
And stuff but i took it to the next.
Level okay and i like started posting.
Like booty videos like bounce around my.
Buttons up and like no one did videos.
And then i did so it's now it's like you.
Go to any girls video page just trying.
To be a booty model they have like the.
Pictures the videos and seven the thing.
Is it's hard to get like really popular.
Off doing that now cuz its oversaturated.
Like everyone's trying to do it so i was.
Like one of the first so it's like that.
But it's not really copying it's like.
Every everyone copies everyone that is.
The thing of life it's like no you have.
To learn it from somewhere you have to.
Agree so i start copying me it's just i.
Know where they're finding their.
Inspiration but you start noting that i.
Said and i find it interesting you start.
If you said body building right so and.
Your dad was your coach i'm assuming.
He's jacked.
Oh yeah so yeah he's body building is.
That because you grew up on a branch.
You said i mean i grew up on.
Branch but before i was even born he was.
Like a bodybuilder that's like what he.
Did and they got married then he kind of.
Got out of it but my mom and him got.
Divorced and then he started.
Bodybuilding again but yeah i've grew.
I've worked out my whole life we had a.
Gym in the basement in my house growing.
Up i was a daddy's girl i was always.
With him always working out yeah so.
Working on just in my blood it's like.
What i love so it's like if girls want.
That to be their lifestyle then live it.
And if you come back successful off of.
It that's amazing and your method is.
Work out so that you can still eat not.
Starve i work i just work out what i.
Want.
Moderation balance and yeah a lot of.
Girls like they think like not eating is.
Gonna get the like so many people always.
Like oh i'm trying to lose weight i'm.
Not gonna eat people don't understand.
That when you don't eat your body.
We're machines like our bodies are like.
Brilliant like we're always in like like.
Like trying to live like that's art like.
Our body's purpose you know so when you.
Starve yourself and then you eat your.
Body will like store it as fat you guys.
Starvation mode so you're not not ever.
Gonna eat these girls who are starving.
Themselves for like five days then.
They're just gonna go and eat a ton.
Because you're starving and then your.
Body's gonna store as fat so my advice.
Five small meals a day like are you.
Still so that that does work for you.
Then yeah it does work for everyone.
Some things work for other people but.
That's like what i look for me.
I don't think starving works for anyone.
Yeah you're gonna lose weight but right.
It's not the right type of weight you.
Know because it's not healthy it's more.
What am i and how do you feel about like.
Intermittent fasting i think it about.
Fasting fasting no like it is good if.
You really intermediate that's what.
That's called right yeah close enough.
Yeah it's good if you really have a good.
Schedule and you know exactly what.
You're doing a lot of people are doing.
It and they think that they know what.
We're doing and like what do you have no.
Idea like it's all times and like a.
Certain amount of time not to eat to eat.
They just hear someone's time so like oh.
I'm gonna do that too right i'm like pay.
But that's not matching your lifestyle.
Like you have to like plan it out for.
You like in the times and everything so.
You have to actually like.
Knowledgeable about it before you do it.
So many so many fads like oh i'm gonna.
Do that so once i was doing it it's like.
Okay but you have to like sculpt it to.
Your your day not always fun like those.
Diets i mean the fads they work right to.
A certain degree i think if you do it.
That the problem is for a lot of people.
They don't necessarily have your mindset.
Of having two how would you how would.
You say that you created this to be your.
Lifestyle because that seems to be the.
Key because you want to work out a lot.
Of people don't want that's the thing i.
I make it a lifestyle you know some.
People they're like i'm gonna go to the.
Gym and that's like a thing that i'm.
Gonna dread and i'm just gonna do it.
Because i have to do it like i have to.
Go to the gym me i'm like i'm gonna go.
To the gym that's a part of my life it's.
A part of my day i'm excited to go like.
Me and my mama boys made go in the gym.
Like the highlight of her day like the.
Fun part like we didn't go to the gym.
And i gotta go to the gym got hard work.
Me and mom hang out there for hours we.
Have millions of friends really having.
The best time like i think it's just all.
I'm like like how i just find shame it's.
Right i mean i think everyone has like.
If you've ever liked your past.
Experience is like if you're gonna go at.
Disneyland you're gonna have the worst.
Time ever you're not gonna always think.
Back you make oh my god i love.
Disneyland like i think back and think.
Of all the great times i've had working.
Out and i'm like oh my god i love.
Working out.
So check you have to make it fun the.
Moment you make it a job it's a job so.
I've never made working out a job it's.
Just a fun i'm sure but i'm sure there.
Has to be some days where you're just.
Like i don't want oh yeah for sure.
Sometimes i'm like definition and do you.
Go normal right i mean i i don't work.
Out every single day like obviously i'm.
Not like some crazy person but yeah.
Sometimes i have days sometimes five.
Days where i'm even like a bad mood i'm.
I'm down on myself like with things like.
That people don't understand it's like.
Everyone's human i have days where i.
Wake up and i feel this disgusting and.
Fat and i like you at myself you know i.
Look at me i'm like disgusting so we're.
As girls we just like have this like and.
Every girl's is saying like it doesn't.
Matter like girls that think girls like.
Are the most beautiful girl in the world.
Trust me they wake up and they hate.
Themselves somedays - it's just like.
Life as a girl and as humans like you.
Know so yeah i have days i'm very.
Unmotivated and i think my body sucks.
And i want to knock it out of bed all.
Day so in life but.
I fight there like how i find my.
Motivation is like i don't look for.
Motivation like oh i want to get in.
Shape for this pool-party or i want to.
Get in shape because i'm going on.
Vacation like coz right when that is.
Over you're gonna forget about working.
Out and you don't care about working out.
Anymore you have to do it for like a.
Real reason that's not going to go away.
You know and it seems like a you know.
The whole thing with like nature versus.
Nurture where like this how you.
Naturally are this is how you're raised.
It seems like a lot of things that are.
Very positive about you is because of.
Your how we were raised.
Yeah your upbringing and a lot of things.
That you credit so you know being with.
Your dad he was constantly working out.
So you were you saw that work ethic you.
Know that was built into you and just.
The positivity in your mindset and how.
You view things optimistically it's.
Almost like all of that together is.
Built up a lot of your brand so you went.
From like og ig model and to become kind.
Of like a role model now and you're.
Turning that into that aspect so i'm.
Just curious it's like what is your.
Future because we're discussing a lot.
About your past right now but like what.
Are the future steps for you a future i.
Just want to um like i feel like in the.
World today like there's no like really.
Really amazing like role models or.
Models or anyone that little girls can.
Look up to that are all natural just.
Embrace themselves have their big bushy.
Eyebrows natural everything and never.
Gone like any surgeries done or anything.
And like no offense of people who do get.
Surgeries but i think that there should.
Be someone in the world for girls to.
Look up to and be like that's my role.
Model you know and there's just no one.
In the world right now really like that.
So i want to be that role model for.
Girls i want to teach them to love their.
Natural selves and they don't have to.
Change anything to be like perfect or.
Fit into society because how boring.
Would it be a world that we all look the.
Same because with surgeries people start.
Looking the same it's not fun anymore.
Like surgery is also unhealthy like very.
Dangerous to go under the knife just for.
Your looks and stuff so it's like i want.
To teach girls that there is no standard.
Of beauty you're beautiful because.
That's how you look and you're beautiful.
The way you are look i understand when.
Girls like are born they have like.
Really big noses and they don't feel.
Confident they you really need get that.
But people take it a little overboard.
And they have already butyl.
Features and then they ruin them you.
Know and now it's like oh well you were.
So beautiful before why'd you do that to.
Yourself so i want to be like a really.
Good role model for girls and i just.
Want to be like a mogul you know like.
You know those people that are like so.
Big and you're like how are they in this.
Movie how are they major and you're just.
Like they're just like a name that like.
You just they can do what they want i.
Just want to be able to do whatever i.
Want mm-hmm that's a good goal yeah and.
People like how she do it i don't know.
Like you know like you don't know like.
Why they're so big they just art right.
What are you not doing right now that.
You wish you could do in the future.
Um well you mentioned like movies you.
Just mentioned like oh my i mean that.
You want to be i would i would probably.
Wanna be i've never had like i've never.
Gone to an acting coach or never done.
Anything so it's like i think um if i.
Give a shine i love it but it's one of.
Those things i like to do things i love.
So if i did it i hated it i just won't.
Pursue it because it's not something i.
Love but if i did it i loved it i want.
To pursue it because i i don't want to.
Do anything that feels like work and.
It's not not fun like i think everything.
Should be fun and like do stuff there's.
So many things you can do in the world.
Do something you love you know so okay.
Life is short.
She said eat yeah what's your favorite.
Food it was for so long before i lived.
Here but now i'm like hi happy for you.
Then i've lived.
Oh and i live in colorado because.
There's nine and out oh but i literally.
Eight have eaten it so many times not.
Kidding don't get me wrong guys i love.
Me some in and out but you know.
Chick-fil-a is kind of like my day one a.
One for life this i mean he went to.
Their headquarters he's such a fan dude.
I will go there i got i'm hanging out.
There all day i got to meet dan cathy.
And oh all those people like whose is.
Amazing and i like like i'm religious.
And like i love god so it's like i love.
What they stand for and stuff it's just.
A really amazing company so love them.
Guys and i love their chuckle a sauce do.
You love that i am a fan of the texas.
Pete hot sauce and the commercial and.
The honey honey mustard.
And my two favorite sauces all-time.
About like well i it was in an interview.
As well where you said you will go to.
Chick-fil-a and do that kind of stuff.
And go there and just eat or whatever do.
You get any like pushback from that.
Oh like i mean you know there's a stigma.
Of like oh chick-fil-a supporters don't.
Support gay people oh.
I mean he's gotten pushback for his love.
For chick-fil-a i see you know what i.
Think though this is my approach we.
Don't know the company the people who.
Created this microphone company they.
Could be supporting terrorism they could.
Be supporting animal cruelty we don't.
Know these things and you know when i.
When i go to chick-fil-a i i go to the.
One in hollywood.
I see the gay community eating there too.
So i'm like you know what i'm gonna eat.
Here too because they have good service.
And their sauces are good their.
Sandwiches are good mm-hm and well the.
Thing is if you're receiving that kind.
Of pushback and you have you know 20.
Almost 22 million followers and i'm.
Assuming you're gonna see even more of a.
Pushback and the thing with that is.
Weird because i've gone a chick-fil-a.
Countless times and had gay people like.
Working for me like working there so i'm.
Like where is this info coming from like.
Where the real facts at chick-fil-a do.
Those real facts because then they need.
To go and fire all the gay people.
Working for them so i've see it so i.
Don't know i don't believe stuff that.
The media like i need to see real facts.
Coming from so i don't believe that so.
People said that i'd be like where's.
Your proof that's good i mean you're bit.
Like it like you said and you want to be.
Genuine right so how do you feel about.
Like censoring yourself when it comes to.
Like you know the whole cancel culture.
Thing right like being yourself do you.
How much do you worry about what you're.
Saying is being offensive to someone or.
You know you might want to hold back.
Because you don't want to get cancelled.
Yeah i don't know i feel like i don't.
Really talk i don't talk politics and i.
Don't talk any of that kind of stuff so.
I mean if people are just offended with.
Me just being mic you don't care bubbly.
Self like who i am as a person i don't.
Care i don't really talk about it i.
Don't want to get into that because.
Everyone.
Their own opinion you're never gonna be.
Able to please everybody i care about my.
Opinion it's my secret thoughts and no.
One needs to know about it except my.
Family so you're very wise for your age.
For your age yeah i have to say your.
Answers and the way you approach.
Different things thank you you're very.
Wise i've an old soul 80s music is my.
Favorite music all i listen to is.
Probably why ha ha that's why why are.
Most people who talk to you that are a.
Lot older than you are they kind of.
Surprised at how you carry yourself it's.
Funny because my my only friend cuz i.
Dropped out of high school when i was 14.
I have freshman year i dropped out of.
High school and i was home-schooled.
Before that and stuff so my mom is like.
My bestest friend the world like she is.
Like my best friend like i've haven't.
Really ever had like a friend my age.
That's really my like i've had friends.
And then they're not my friends anymore.
I'm like i've never had like a best.
Friend that's my age my mom is my best.
Friend and uh when i was through and i.
Dropped out she was in cosmetology.
School like to do like a cetacean so i.
Was in school like before i dropped out.
I wasn't ever a school i i just would.
Never go go to schools my mom and i'm.
From i was every single friend was her.
Friend my friend like i was best friend.
Like all my friends have always been.
Older my best friend other than my mom.
Is 35 so i always have gotten along with.
Older women i don't know why i never can.
Relate to girls my age those want to do.
Things i don't want to do they talk.
About things i'm like and then older.
Women i can relate to them we're best.
Friends like they i feel like they don't.
Even think cuz when i was like 17 i met.
My best friend and she's 10 years older.
Than me and she's like she's sometimes.
Like think like wow you're only 7 i.
Could like mine blow her like like you.
How are you this young because you're.
More mature than most of my friends that.
Are my age so i think it's just i think.
Some people are just old souls right.
That's me i don't want to look back.
Though i'm like in my 40s i'm like.
I wish i woulda live my you're 16 i do.
Not i know i don't do anything fun like.
I'm really a homebody i don't like to go.
To the club like i'm like i don't want.
To regret not having fun but to me it's.
Not fun like you know how i'm having fun.
Is like when i'm home with my dogs going.
To dinner let's go to another angle you.
Can keep that will highlight in what was.
On that so guys i'm a little i have a.
Lot of saliva okay well that's good.
That's an old person trait yeah no no no.
That is it guys you guys are probably.
Like let's never have summer on this.
Podcast again she doesn't let us go.
You're welcome back every time yes it's.
Very entertaining don't worry we'll wipe.
It down with that being said we would.
Take a quick cheesy break and we'll be.
Right back okay what's up i have a.
Question can i go ahead okay okay so i.
Have a question here so you make a lot.
Of references to scripture i mean you.
Mentioned that you you're christian did.
You did you grow up in a christian give.
Myself like i don't like say i'm.
Christian or anything just because i.
Like christians not like a bad rap.
Sometimes really really judgmental like.
Some people think of it's like this.
Sigma about it like i just say i have a.
Relationship with my lord and i love.
Jesus and i have my own walk with him.
And that's what it is see but don't you.
Think that's kind of sad that you have.
To say that though like that you're have.
To be afraid but i think that i've come.
Across a lot of christians that are very.
Judgmental that make me don't want to.
Associate with them similar to the ig.
Models well because the thing i am.
Christian like if we were gonna say a.
Religion but i just feel like there's so.
Many judgmental christians and they do.
Like the trying to like make you feel.
Like a horrible person like we're all.
Sinners and we're all like we can't be.
Perfect that's why we have jesus you.
Know so i feel like some people try to.
Like say things make it's just like not.
Good enough it's because they make their.
Own agenda with their spewing their.
Words in their own way use the scripture.
To like make you and it's just not cool.
Like if you live god god is loving and.
In all this good stuff is the true.
Message of christianity is to love one.
Another.
Yeah they're like hypocrites i hate they.
Don't they're like hating and it also.
We're not supposed to judge other people.
And they're literally judging every.
Single thing and saying that you're.
Going to help you know that's not me and.
That's not like what i preach so did you.
Grow up in it or did or was it something.
You discovered later on and were friends.
I grew up with it yeah but i'm not one.
Of those people like oh just cuz i grew.
Up it is what i believe like i've done.
My own research my own stuff.
I'm not she's gonna believe and do what.
My parents say like i do it for myself.
So yeah i love have you i mean when did.
You move out here um three years ago now.
Yeah i would actually come out here for.
A month like an air b&b and then go home.
From us cuz i just didn't really want to.
Live fully out here because like i just.
Heard crazy stories about the people out.
Here and like even just be down here for.
A month it's just like hard to know.
Who's real and who's true and who's like.
You know i just don't want to get rick.
Wrapped up in the wrong things but now i.
Live here and i think i'm just morally.
Very straight so i don't get caught up.
In the wrong things so have you uh not.
That you're out here have you found a.
Friend who's more your age i guess you.
Know cuz you said you didn't really have.
That i'm like i guess though yeah well.
Yeah actually i do i have one of my.
Really really really good friends her.
Name is nas and like she's actually.
Gonna be my i'm hiring her to be my.
Assistant actually because she's like.
One of the few people i can trust.
She's like amazing and i always has had.
My back you know like i'll meet friends.
I'll have friends and like i just feel.
Like they don't want to really be my.
Friend like i just i'm like if you're my.
Friend like i think that you're like my.
Sister like we're friends like i want to.
Be besties like i want to tell you each.
Other everything i want to be so close.
Like girls don't want to be like that.
With me like they have their other.
Friend and then they don't invite me and.
They don't want to really be friends i'm.
Like they want to be friends but they.
Don't want to be friends so that's why i.
Don't really i'm not friends with like.
Other like influencer girls or anything.
A lot i'm just like friends with like.
Girls who are like normal because they.
Actually want to be my friend like i.
Don't like fake    like i'm not gonna.
Free friends with you on the internet.
And then.
Friends outside the inner you know i.
Want to actually meet friends right oh.
It sounds like i mean it seemed that we.
The reason i ask is because it does seem.
Like you have this mindset of someone.
Who is from like a small town or.
Something and you said you grew up on a.
Ranch in colorado yeah yeah and i was.
Just curious is how long you've been.
Here because i mean i grew up in a small.
Town in hawaii and when i moved here i.
Found probably the same things i was it.
Kind of shocked and not prepared for the.
People that live here i'm not saying.
That all the people here are like that.
But there's a lot of um on how to.
Describe it just manipulation i guess.
And the thing if you think about.
Everyone here has a reason to be here.
And they are trying to break cessful.
Mm-hmm so you're a target yeah and.
People's tactics to getting famous are.
Getting to where their success is like.
Stepping on people to get there you know.
And if you're not that type of person.
You can get stepped on very easy exactly.
So you just have to kind of be mindful.
Of those type people not everyone's like.
That like i know there are people who.
Love people and want to because you can.
Get successful and you can collab with.
People and you can do things you know.
Loving way and uplift each other not hey.
I'm gonna step on you to get to where.
I'm going right but it's as more people.
Are very insecure in themselves that.
They don't feel that's possible because.
It's like oh this this relationship.
Couldn't be authentic because i can't.
Fathom having one like that right so.
They're so used to just taking an.
Advantage of others because they're.
Afraid of being taken advantage of.
Themselves yeah but do you find it.
That's one of the reasons why you're.
More of a homebody as well yeah i don't.
Know everyone just wants to go out and.
La like the clubs i'm like you you.
There's nothing worse in life than.
Standing at this dirty couch with a.
Bunch of girls spilling drinks on me to.
Get on this couch i'm like cool.
Take my spot stop stepping on my toes.
Have it i'm leaving like why do we have.
To stand on this couch anyways why do we.
Have to stay around this couch can we.
Like go oh like somewhere else like more.
Room like we get these couches out of.
Here and like because my mom tells me.
Stories about like and when she was like.
Younger my age going it was like a dance.
Floor and people are having fun now it's.
Like ratchet music and we're on a couch.
And there's drinks being spilt on me and.
Like people are stepping on my toes.
Trying to get on this couch like because.
Drunk girls trying to get like on the.
Couch sometimes i'm like and i'm not.
Like a crazy partier i'm just kind.
Chillin there i'm like i don't want to.
Be here but if it was like a dance floor.
And we had a room and we could actually.
Like drink and have fun and like the.
Answers i mean it'd be a lot more fun i.
Just don't really like the couches and.
The vibe like i mean i have to be really.
Drunk to go to club it kind of sound.
Like ryan a little bit surprised right.
Now i don't like those couches either -.
The dancing part.
You would actually dance well sir when.
I'm sober.
Okay i've seen i'm drunk i'm like okay.
Because i all cares got the world like.
I'm friends with everyone like that's.
Probably a little intense like when i'm.
Drunk.
I go up to every single person i'm like.
Hi my name is summer and i give him a.
Hug like i wake up the next day and i.
Like hope to god like that was a dream.
Because it's like i'm overly friendly.
Where it's like but i mean i can't be.
That's just like my inner self is very.
Friendly and i want to be friends with.
Everyone so it comes out and then i'm.
Like but you have to be careful because.
People are mean no they'll take that on.
In a completely different way yeah.
Oh guys probably do take it a different.
Way even girls too because they're like.
Oh why is she so friendly what does she.
Want.
Yeah it's just a different which is why.
I was saying it's a little different.
Here sure like you everyone's on like.
The lookout for like everything so even.
If someone's not even being like that.
You you could think every little.
Movement that they're doing it could be.
Like that because we're on the lookout.
For someone to mess up like    us over.
Something so yeah so it's a well it's a.
Real weird place in vegas you guys go.
Out a lot no no no no we don't we don't.
Go i mean when the reason i moved to.
Vegas i lived here for like a year and a.
Half and then i just wasn't a fan so i.
Moved back to it.
Well vegas is close enough to la we're.
Like an hour flight and and surprisingly.
It's it's super chill it's not the strip.
If that's what you're thinking.
Yeah yeah yeah people it's just like.
Anything people think like oh vegas i.
Think that you're on the strip every day.
We're walking around with one of those.
Big like icy looking yeah.
Walking around i'm like that's vegas.
Yeah.
No you're probably something like a.
Little suburban house like chillin far.
Far from the strip yeah yeah my head.
Goes to the strip i think you guys are.
Just like i didn't know people go.
Clubbing here.
No yeah i'm my friend her name so.
Another really good friend i have out.
Here.
She's like a clothing designer and she.
Like has these clothes like she writes.
On jackets like pants on jackets and she.
Has this one that says loss and bottle.
Service killed los angeles and it's so.
True like bottle service killed lawson.
Oh you mean the like the couches and.
Stuff that's what you're talking about.
The couch is yeah oh yes because back in.
The day like my momma tell me there's no.
Bottle service there's a vip room and.
Then there and there's bars you just go.
Buy your own stuff but this bottle.
Service comes and you need a couch and a.
Table for the bottle service and that's.
How you get alcohol and stuff i mean.
There's still bar but it's a whole.
Different vibe now i should have been.
Born in a different time baby.
I always say i want i wish i was a.
Teenager with my mom that sounds weird.
Right you're like i couldn't none of you.
See her as your best friend yeah i was.
About the same age in the 80s we would.
Tear    she had the same kind of.
Energy as you oh yeah i mean she's a.
Little bit more laid-back i'm a little.
Bit more crazy but no she's like them so.
What your dad is cool is mom and my my.
Me and my dad are so alike like he's.
Actually a lot like me he's a lot higher.
Energy it's kind of crazy that's me i.
Think that's why you guys i think you.
Naturally have a lot of energy and i.
Think that also aids your workout.
Schedule yeah oh i feel like that's why.
You love doing it cuz you have to exert.
Oh what would happen to me just chilling.
Yeah you just explode i have really dude.
I really like i'm i like i'm very.
Short-fused sometimes and when i'm not.
Working out i'm like i just freak out.
But then i'm like fine two seconds later.
And i forget that i haven't freaked out.
Everyone's like i can't like i did.
Something i'm like what i think that's.
Why you are the way you are i think you.
Have so much and you said your.
Metabolism is high you just have so much.
Energy you have to do something with not.
Here can expose a hospital speaking of.
Exerting energy i saw i saw one of your.
Recent videos what.
I saw one of your recent youtube videos.
That you were in the challenger games.
Then the paul brothers put on your super.
Athletic i saw you running on that track.
Pissed off about this because the girl.
Who won has a scholarship in track you.
Can't be here that's like playing like.
Um tag football whatever with lebron i.
Don't know does he play football that's.
Like playing a game of like basketball.
Like pickup out with lebron james like.
That's not fair yeah like if you have a.
Scholarship who's a girl charity yes i.
Can place then or well okay so the gun.
Went off word i've said this so many.
Times people are gonna be like what the.
Hell summer we get it so everyone's like.
I thought like they said i don't have.
Never run track before mhm.
I did it like before i dropped out i.
Like did just a few practices but i.
Never like i dropped out of school so i.
Got a min like finish track or whatever.
But i guess they're not supposed to say.
2 3 1 or 1 2 3.
And just like iron shop but i thought.
They were gonna say like 1 2 3 anything.
Guy there gunshot went off and everyone.
Win then i was like and then i went so.
If you would like watch the think clip i.
Don't go right away so and the start is.
Everything so if you don't go when.
Another girl who won she's like a track.
Person so she did the blocks and.
Everything i don't know how to use a.
Block so it was just wasn't fair i.
Probably could have won if i left that.
Girl wasn't in it like we're not.
Supposed to be here and then and then um.
Yeah and then if i had a good start.
Because i caught up with everyone except.
Her cuz she's like really fast you were.
Second third because i really had a bad.
Start if you watch it i literally go.
Like 4 or 5 like it's a lot it's a.
Little thought when you're like on the.
Race that's kind of similar with the.
Guys too cuz toby was second but the guy.
Who got first.
He's like an actual sprinter or an.
Athlete or something like that.
You shouldn't have no like this is.
Charity we're having fun like are you.
Competitive you see bags with it i was.
Just gonna say.
Like i'm very but i think that's why i.
Can be sick like i'm in just a go-getter.
And like if i put my mind to something.
If i want something i work hard for it.
And i think that's but even if she has a.
Scholarship in track if she's an.
Entertainer she should still be allowed.
To compete okay that's fine that's fine.
Well    she was a youtuber i'm.
Assuming she had to be arranged or like.
Her some kind of influencer yeah it.
Assumes like an olympian influencer like.
Yeah we can tell you care about it so.
That's what i'm passionate about.
Everything i'm just a passionate person.
You want and i what you won thanks no.
But the thing is i have not run in so.
Long at it pride i was camping like the.
Whole week but i came home early from my.
Campaign trip in colorado to do it so.
Like is whatever i'm just too.
Competitive i'm so hard on myself so i'm.
Like huh but it's like fine yeah i mean.
Scholarship and all she can compete it's.
Fine guys other your other hobbies.
Um i mean i like to paint like i was.
Telling you guys i'm painting all over.
My arms i like to eat that's like a.
Hobby i like to say that's like a good.
One like i could be you ever do.
Competitive eating.
You have the metabolism for it yeah and.
You work hard enough so i think that's.
What it is.
No yeah there's actually youtubers this.
Guy matt stoney who eats like ridiculous.
Amounts of food yeah.
And like certain amounts of time and.
It's just like it's it's so impressive.
Wow.

Stomach no he's mad skinny dude yeah.
It's over he's like the sharpest jawline.
Ever to wow well maybe any i go against.
Him okay eating and what was it sorry.
Oh painting painting eating um yeah i.
Like to be out in nature i mean i grew.
Up riding horses and stuff so i mean i.
Haven't ridden in a while but that's.
Like riding a bike like i always know.
How to ride a horse that's like my like.
Foundation of life you know you go back.
A lot um i was just back like around the.
Time of the challenger games wherever i.
Was in colorado and then i came back.
Early for it and yeah so that's the.
First time.
I've been home in like a year so i don't.
Really go back too often i just feel.
Like when i go home i'm like i like see.
My family and everything is like great.
When i'm seeing them and then i see them.
All and i'm like why am i here there's.
Just nothing to do like i need to go and.
Then i almost get depressed because i'm.
Like there's so much stuff i should be.
Doing like for work and stuff so that's.
Crazy so it's so similar to what i do.
Yeah backgrounds yeah but when i was at.
That age - that's like riding horses i'm.
Not writing for going home into a small.
Town where it's literally nothing.
There's nothing to do they don't live in.
The small town like larkspur anymore but.
Hmm it's a suburb like denver and like.
They live in the outskirts at denver and.
It's pretty it's just not the same as.
Here it's not fast paced like it's not.
Like it's tough to do like it's just.
Kind of like yeah okay like i just like.
To do i like to i'm like a go-go type.
Person some huh you're a go-getter but.
You're also homebody yeah like there's a.
Lot of things i can do at home hmm.
Like i have a gym at my house and i have.
A paint studio so i don't really have to.
Go anywhere right everything you need.
Everything i need yeah actually maybe.
You want to talk about kind of like cuz.
You showed us earlier some paintings.
That you did you did shoes and stuff.
Yeah okay so i have some like mail-merge.
That i like so but like they're just.
Like late canvases like just white so.
I've been painting them and i don't.
Really want to like sell them and so.
Because like how do you like what how do.
I put a price on that anyways cuz like i.
Don't want to put it too low because.
It's like this that's my hard work and i.
Don't want to put it too high and people.
Be like really    like we're gonna.
Pay that for that like come on.
So i want people kind of as if they want.
