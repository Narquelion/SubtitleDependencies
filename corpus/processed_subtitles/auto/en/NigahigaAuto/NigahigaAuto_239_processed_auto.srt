My name is ryan higa i've never believed.
That these go stoves were real because.
They all seemed so overly dramatic oh my.
God i just got chills the ac vent is.
Right there it is crazy how cold it is.
Right here and extremely easy to fake.
Hose that but then one night i had an.
Experience of my own that completely.
Changed my views on gosu ghosts are real.
Well they're not as they are what that.
Wasn't the experience i was referring to.
Because i don't have footage of it.
However i can assure you that despite.
All the jokes and obvious ghost show.
Parody everything you're about to see.
And hear is 100% authentic even if we.
End up capturing nothing at all this is.
Brian tries ghost goes on him so right.
Now we are headed about 40 miles outside.
Of las vegas nevada to the town of good.
Springs to investigate the historic and.
Famously haunted building known as the.
Pioneers has been featured in multiple.
Movies and tv shows including ghost.
Adventures which were definitely not.
Coffee we're planning to stay throughout.
The entire night to capture as much as.
We can hopefully we actually get.
Something we have our normal filming.
Equipment normal audio recording devices.
But in addition to that we picked up.
Some night vision cameras and some.
Actual ghost hunting equipment including.
Like those evp recorders and clothes box.
But two random stuff that we don't.
Actually know how to use but luckily for.
Us we are going to be meeting the owner.
Of the saloon who is.
A lot more experience in this than we.
Are you a man.
Yeah meet you the legends here good to.
See ya other legend a pair so um can you.
Just tell me like a history of this.
Place i sure bet so this is the town of.
Good springs which back in the teens it.
Was one of the largest city in the.
Valley so good sprees got its big boom.
Of course because of the mining so i.
Mean i saw the episode that they did on.
Ghost adventures here and that was you.
Beyond the bar yeah right so i saw a.
Little bit of your story but just so.
That we can have it tell us a little bit.
Of your experiences here my experience.
It was about probably about nine years.
Ago i was getting ready to close up the.
Bar counted all the money made sure the.
Doors were locked but there's a full.
Apparition at the end of the bar that.
Drinks a beer maybe about that tall.
Beat-up cowboy hat just by looking at.
You know he's you were looking directly.
Matically i didn't disappear or we had i.
Would say eye contact but that would be.
Impossible.
You could tell by just looking at him.
That he was there but not is there.
Anything correlated to the history.
Probably the best documented situation.
At the bar there's three bullet holes.
They could see daylight through all.
Three of them and that's from a card.
Game in 1915 where one of the players.
Was caught - you try to cash out ten.
Dollars and the dealer ended up shooting.
Him.
Wilda justified homicide his punishment.
Was to bury him in the cemetery.
Interesting okay and obviously we're.
Gonna need some of your help with some.
Of the equipment that we're not used to.
Using i'm lending you guys the full.
Staff of the haunted lock down to her.
And then they're gonna guide you guys.
Through it with all the spirit boxes all.
That but you're out that's a good night.
Yeah all right all right.
Again well thank you again so i.
Appreciate know we appreciate it yeah.
This is should be interesting.
Music.
All right so i'm here with jill and.
Daryl and you guys want to explain we.
Have a bunch of fun devices here but you.
Want to explain what you guys do exactly.
Yes actually we're members of the.
Pioneer saloon coast team yeah so.
Basically what we have here is a.
Collection of the devices that we use.
For the lockdowns and joe can explain a.
Little bit about them yes this right.
Here is one of my favorite devices it's.
A spirit box with this device we can.
Actually communicate with the spirits.
Through the white noise this is just a.
Radio receiver what we do is we scan it.
In reverse so this just cat scanning.
Different radio frequencies and so.
Sometimes we'll pick up words or in a.
Very rare occasions you'll pick up whole.
Sentences which is pretty cool because.
You're it's like you have before in the.
Pen just to explain we're not in the.
Saloon right now this is the si nexus.
Alone so there's not any technically.
Anything here right that we've gotten a.
Lot of activity here i think it's really.
The whole property well you were also.
Telling us that electronics for whatever.
Reason here messed up like we've already.
Had one of our batteries a couple of.
Them actually just fully charged when we.
Came here just dead that's a that's sort.
Of typical but here the body a lot of.
People a lot of guests have said that.
Like oh my phone died and this doesn't.
That happened were like mike that's not.
Surprising this is one of the original.
It's called a emf detector what a lot of.
People in the paranormal field use this.
Will you can measure when the lights go.
Up.
Okay that means someone a spirit is.
Close to this basically measuring energy.
So what energy becomes comes interactive.
It's the same with with the ram pod.
That's my energy interacting with it so.
The so the closer something is exactly.
This is the ovilus five this actually.
Has noticed that was this this is.
Speaking now said raised and this will.
Actually it has a built in dictionary.
And the spirits can actually pick the.
Words that they want to communicate with.
Us through this right so why did that.
Just happen now raised an end i'm not.
Real sure um is there ever a time where.
You feel like it's just how do you know.
It's really thank you can be it can it.
Can be random because it's affected also.
By the environment but the goal for us.
Is like you know if you want to try to.
Get one of these to light off will say.
Are you here think you make the meter.
Light up and try to get a specific.
Reaction to a question now we do have a.
Lot of prominent spirits here one of.
Them i'd love to talk about on this side.
Actually because ultimately she was.
Murdered right over i'm like fried by.
The second booth over gerrard left her.
Name was ruby ruby was here in the store.
The cafe it was a mercantile store back.
Then she was alone and someone came in.
And they beat her they raped her and.
Then she was strangled and she was left.
For dead right over children after all.
Right a man that seems like a good place.
Is in the story right as we began to cut.
Cameras and move on to the next part of.
Our investigation one of the devices.
Unexpectedly began to go off on its own.
I mean it's fine if you work now nobody.
Touched that as you guys just saw but.
You got that cold there you go they're.
Doing it again yeah.
Can you make it go to red my gosh what.
Does that mean red only just ask them.
Okay i take it you guys are ready to.
Tell ruby story that let's let's do.
After reviewing this footage carefully.
With headphones our audio devices also.
Capture what we thought sounded like a.
Scary ghost more.
Only to later discovered that it's.
Actually a familiar noise that our.
Cameraman gregg makes when he scares.
We're in the booth right now where ruby.
Was murdered well there wasn't a booth.
It was she was on the ground yeah.
Correct right where we're setting her.
Head was a little bit past year is where.
She am okay so this is the first i guess.
Spot right so about ten thirty one night.
We drive house to cemetery which all saw.
And it's pitch-black we parked on the.
Outside and there's a fence there so the.
Woman said should we take photos i said.
Of course i always take three this is.
What was in the second photo is that.
Amazing now until someone can tell me.
Differently because i know this girl and.
I'm very unsound.
But right you can't tell me that is no.
Person that's that's her did we get what.
Is happening right now ruby loves that.
What her story's told i want to show her.
Photo they get very excited it's going.
Crazy yeah they're just i i adore these.
Spirits they're amazing and they're very.
Friendly that's good to hear yes after.
These two strange occurrences in the.
Cafe next to the saloon it was time to.
Investigate the saloon itself by sitting.
At the exact same table that the poker.
Player was murdered at back in nineteen.
Something a long time ago is there.
Anyone here with us right now.
Music.
That's like yeah this is tip give our.
Audio recorders closely can you guys say.
Hello to us how many spirits are here.
With us.
Ruby are you here with us three and you.
Make his meter line up in front of him.
Thank you.
Okay how many ladies are here with us.
That was a girls voice.
Really after closer review we noticed.
That the flight pattern of those orbs.
Looks similar to that of a bug but since.
We're not experienced enough to.
Distinguish between actual orbs and bugs.
We can't debunk this one so for now.
We'll just call it the bug is all here.
With us right now anything you want to.
Say paul hello we continue to try and.
Communicate with paul for nearly 30.
Minutes but had little to no response.
But because paul died playing poker we.
Decided to bring out playing cards in.
Hopes to trigger a response from him.
When this happened hey paul paul do you.
Think we should call yeah but that was.
The only coherent response we got for.
The next twenty minutes so we decided to.
Move on to the next spot that has been.
Frequently reported for having.
Paranormal activity but right now we're.
Gonna have its i don't know it just.
Keeps going red which supposedly there's.
A lot of activity we're gonna head to.
The bathroom because weird i'm not.
Sure what happened there but they said.
That a lot of women say that a lot.
Happens in the women's bathroom.
Specifically the women's side i think we.
Should check that out all right so we're.
Going to the women's bathroom.
Nothing this is like less activity than.
Out there.
Yeah your other man's.
It's really yeah that's the keys playing.
Red i'll be good right here.
Look is there someone in here.
Music.
It smells so bad in here compared to the.
Other one i think men are just smelly.
There's definitely some activity yeah.
Look this was never going on there's.
Someone in the bathroom with me oh oh.
Miss appear sick right here.
It's a great oh it's right here we go.
Hard up glide up you got a little red oh.
Yeah.
That's a cold ass that's a strong red.
That's solid red who else is in here.
What do we take that is about that yeah.
Let's do it.
Yeah when we do it on the ground i'm.
Trying what is this thing base please to.
Show you the consistency when you go.
Like this so earlier i was going off.
When it's on that's why i freaked us out.
Hasn't really done since there's.
Something there continue to investigate.
The men's bathroom with the rem pod we.
Also got a coherent response for the.
Very first time from the ovilus v the.
Device that allows spirits to.
Communicate using a select number of.
Words almost like a modern-day ouija.
Board this may not seem like a big deal.
But throughout the entire night the.
Ovilus v had little to no activity and.
Even when it did it gave us words that.
Seemed completely irrelevant but when it.
Gave us the words look area and much the.
Exact same time that we were looking at.
An area very much lee we couldn't.
Pretend that we weren't freaked out much.
Lee freaked out.
You this is your show are you still here.
Oh what's on the other side of this wall.
The only thing that's actually out here.
No it's yes at this exact moment outdoor.
Audio equipment could barely capture it.
Two of our cameramen heard a thump.
Coming from behind them on the other.
Side of the room what was that what you.
Hear i was like that like a door on this.
End.
Never would be addressed.
I'll remember i just went through this.
Door to get the card yeah the cards in.
This door with isis both of these doors.

The silliness and jokes with these.
Voiceovers all the footage and audio.
That you've just seen and heard is.
Exactly what we captured that night and.
Whether you're a believer or a skeptic.
There are things in this world that.
We'll never know for sure your spirits.
Really trying to communicate with us or.
Was it some kind of interference do we.
Capture actual orbs on camera or were.
Those just bugs flying around in the.
Dark did we really in fact witness a.
Spirit physically closing a full-size.
Wooden door or is great just a big fat.
Wooden liar we will never know all we.
