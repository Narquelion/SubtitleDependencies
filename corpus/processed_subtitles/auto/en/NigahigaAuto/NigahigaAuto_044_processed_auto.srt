Ago actually last time we did was with.
You we did it for shawn yeah it wasn't.
As good what part of you watch the show.
You might be wondering why it's on this.
Chap there wasn't any vlog type of stuff.

It's time i'm gonna have more personal.
Stuff on this channel things that are.
Shows that are around what i do i don't.
Cook i know i said that i'm lying but.
Not really and you know what i've.
Actually learned a lot and the.
Difference is we don't have shawn this.
Time that's my little worried because.
Last time we had paco it was so hard.
Because you don't know i mean i don't.
Know how to cook i'll admit that i don't.
Know how to cook that's why i made this.
Show i know how to cook you do not he.
Doesn't know how to more than you okay.
So well here's a scenario all the guys.
Who we normally cook for the rest of our.
Hpc they're not in town right now so.
