Hey guys so thanksgiving was yesterday i.
Mean coasted a video called things that.
Ruin thanksgiving part 2 where basically.
We had to make a whole thanksgiving.
Dinner as props for the video shoot my.
Parents actually came into town and.
Cooked a whole another thanksgiving.
Dinner so now we have like way too much.
Food and rather than eating leftovers.
Until all the food goes bad and we have.
To throw it away and waste it i thought.
Why not just pack it up right now while.
It's still good and give it to somebody.
Who needs it more than we do and today.
That's what we're gonna do we just.
Finished packing up all these meals and.
We're gonna go deliver them to the.
Homeless people of las vegas which if.
You don't know there's a lot of them and.
Yes we already called the las vegas.
Police department to make sure that it.
Was legal to do miss sadly it's illegal.
To feed the homeless in certain states.
Believe it or not because the last time.
I did this in a video called christmas.
Ninja where i gave away food and.
Presents to kids and random homeless.
People sadly i got a lot of people.
Saying that it was illegal to do and i.
Shouldn't be doing that i personally.
Think is ridiculous and discouraged is.
Helping other people but whatever we got.
The okay so we're good to go but you.
Know what's even more fun than that.
Feeding the homeless and not getting.
Caught as a ninja this is the wrong way.
This is still a wrong way it's almost.
There there we go just like a vulnerable.
