Hey guys so let me first off this video.
By saying we recently reached a goal.
That seven years ago i never even.
Thought was possible for me at least and.
This goal just so happens to be drumroll.
Please.
Hello can't give you a drumroll if you.
Have the drumsticks yeah but that's for.
Dessert i want the drum roll only have.
The sticks for the drum you have the.
Drum roll sticks tastes like bad pun we.
Just reached 10 million subscribers know.
What's gonna clean this up oh it was.
Just editing anyway on a serious note.
Thank you guys so much i know i used to.
Make a thank you video after every 1.
Million subscribers and i haven't made.
One since the 6 million subscriber video.
But the reason for that is because those.
Videos never get many views so i figured.
You guys don't like to watch them.
Because they're not that interesting but.
It doesn't mean that i'm any less.
Grateful for all the love and support.
That you guys show me i know i always.
Say i have the best fans in the world.
But the more i think about it you guys.
Are more than just fans to me you're.
Your lamp's don't get me wrong having.
Fans are awesome they make you feel like.
You're well cool thing is fans come and.
Go you're the new hottest thing they're.
Fanning all over you once you go cold.
They go and find the next hot thing to.
Fan lamps are more than that they're.
Like friends even when you're not the.
Hot topic and you go completely cold.
Lamps never leave you in fact when.
You're cold they actually give you one.
And no matter what shape or size i don't.
Even need to know what they look like i.
Know that when i hit that switch lamps.
Are gonna be there for me in my darkest.
Times.
