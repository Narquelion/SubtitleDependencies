So as you know it's a very important.
Time all around the world because the.
Olympics are funny i'm learning how to.
Harmonize yet i still don't know how to.
Split screen but one day hey guys so.
Summer olympics are finally back again.
The olympics are a time for friendship.
Hey it's a time for competition ah it's.
A time for friendly competition it.
Sounds like a donkey hey ah it's a time.
For five major regions all around the.
World to come together and compete in.
Peace hence the five olympic rings it's.
Kind of funny how the yellow one stands.
For asian the black one stands for.
Africa and of course the entire.
Background is gonna be white it's a time.
For your older not-so-funny uncle to.
Make those lame olympic jokes that'll.
Say it was pretty good so maybe you.
Should join the olympics huh it's a time.
To win medals upon medals upon medals.
Upon meadows whether you like it or not.
The summer olympics takes over the world.
Every four years and i just have to ask.
You guys am i the only one that doesn't.
Like watching the olympics i'm just.
Being completely honest with you guys i.
Don't find it to be very entertaining.
Mean don't get me wrong i'll watch.
Gymnastics now and then not because i.
Like the sport but because we're good at.
It for some reason and because of my.
Opinion i have to deal with people every.
Four years who give me crap for not.
Watching the olympics i mean i don't.
Mind if it's like this hey you want to.
Come over and watch the living's with me.
No i don't really like watching the.
Olympics what the olympics are so.
Exciting then why i'm it's just a.
Personal preference i don't like all the.
Sports of this no i mean why are you.
Here then oh see i told you i'd learn on.
A split screen maybe you should join the.
Olympics were editing hope anyway i.
Don't care the people love the olympics.
I mean i've tried to force myself to.
Watch it and be like hey ryan this is.
Really fun it's not but i can't stand.
When people give me crap for an opinion.
Alright i deliver sir i'm gonna watch.
Now i'm not really into the olympics oh.
Wow i guess i didn't realize that you.
Hated the us i don't yeah you don't.
Support your own country what if you.
Don't like their culture then move i.
Don't support my country i don't support.
My country well i guess i actually don't.
Do that much i'm not like in the army or.
Anything.
But i love my country i love my country.
More than that person that seems the.
Laughter my high school sporting events.
And tries way too hard to show off their.
Voice.
I might not be the most patriotic person.
But just because you watch the olympics.
It doesn't mean you support our country.
Any more than i you're not being.
Supported by watching it on tv only.
Thing you're supporting is that's.
Keeping that work you're watching it on.
And plus people don't watch the olympics.
Because they want to be supported they.
Watch because they want to win for.
Example your country were a child you.
Wouldn't be one of those supportive.
Parents because if you were it would.
Look like this hey usa yeah win or lose.
Today.
Doesn't matter to me i just want you to.
Do your best okay thanks dad.
See that would be supportive but we're.
Not like that we'll be one of those.
Competitive parents we try to live all.
Their dreams through their kid and usa.
Yeah yeah we better win today bring home.
That gold medal all right buddy.
Hanging out a trial to my bed no no you.
Need to win okay we ain't losing to the.
Damn chinese again but the tag is.
Japanese japanese chinese whatever they.
All look the same so you don't watch the.
Olympics to support your country you're.
Just that part that wants their kid to.
Win so that you can be like my kids.
Better than all the other ones but over.
Off the olympics are supposed to stand.
Up for peace between the five major.
Regions of the world it's the complete.
Opposite of why people walk so i don't.
Have i get a lot of hate for this.
Opinion because i already do in real.
Life but ask yourself this if your.
Family and friends didn't watch what you.
Still watch if it wasn't so conveniently.
Broadcasted on so many channels would.
You still watch we didn't have amazing.
Athletes like michael phelps or the.
Entire us basketball team would you.
Still watch because the supportive.
Person would say yes if not maybe you.
Should stop we didn't like your being.
Supportive stop pretend like you're.
Helping our country and stop giving.
People like me crap for not watching hey.
You're pretty fast talker there maybe.
You should join the shot up that was.
Washed hey that was me.
