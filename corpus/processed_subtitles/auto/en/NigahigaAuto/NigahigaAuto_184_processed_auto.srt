Hey guys so i know i'm late to the trend.
As usual i finally did an escape room.
For the first time and because it was my.
First time you can probably already.
Guess but i was just kind of awesome i.
Don't know like really really good hands.
Down one of the best person i've ever.
Seen play this kind of game sorry i know.
I don't want to sound like i'm bragging.
But i mean i do have a hundred percent.
Success rate and i've only done one room.
So far so like wait till i get some real.
Experience under my belt that number is.
Only gonna go up and then you can even.
Ask the people that i went with who've.
Actually done escape rooms in the past.
Like just how naturally good i am how.
Great i was for like my first time well.
I mean you didn't ask them so but even.
Then you know you they were like okay.
Fine i suck okay i suck i suck i'm not.
Good at escape rooms okay and yes it.
Might seem like i'm making a big deal.
Out of nothing well it is to me because.
I always thought i would be good at.
Escape rooms you know i love puzzles and.
Riddles and usually good at that stuff i.
Thought it'd be a natural fit but i.
Guess i just i don't know i'm just not.
Good at them yes i just some i'm not as.
Smart as i thought i was you know hey.
This is the part where you guys are.
Supposed to be like hey come on he.
Wasn't that bad it was your first one.
You know right look some people's brains.
Just work in different ways it doesn't.
Mean i'm stupid okay i'm not dumb look.
Just because i'm a college dropout and.
Yes i cheated a lot in high school and.
Middle school to get better grades so i.
Didn't really retain anything and yeah.
Okay sure they tested me as a child for.
Adhd because i couldn't perform.
So-called basic tasks like raising my.
Hand when i'm supposed to or not paying.
Attention or not punching a girl in the.
Stomach for cutting in front of me in.
The lunch line even though she saw me.
There first doesn't mean that i'm dumb.
Okay i just believe that i was there.
First hannah and hannah if you ever end.
Up seeing this video for whatever reason.
I am very very sorry for that.
Kindergarten mia was just a jerk who was.
First so anyway back to the topic one of.
The worst feelings in the world is.
Finding out that you know something you.
Always thought you were good at and.
Maybe you've some pride in it you're not.
Only not good you're also the exact.
Opposite you're bad.
And the only feeling worse than that is.
When everyone else around you who.
Thought the same thing of you finds that.
Out as well people always used to ask me.
To go to the escape room they would say.
Things like brian you should come with.
Us dude you're not fun yeah you'd be.
Really good at it i think it'd be really.
Easy for you to yeah the way you think.
Outside of the box you'd be perfect for.
It come on let's go yeah they said well.
If you guys say so i mean i guess i.
Could give it a shot yeah that's kind of.
Why they're not the happiest campers.
Right now so it's not like i wasn't.
Trying i tried really hard maybe a.
Little too much to be honest i mean yes.
Sometimes thinking outside the box is.
Great for problem solved but i tend to.
Naturally already think outside the box.
Whether i want to or not if you've been.
Watching this channel long you know if.
You probably already know why i would be.
So bad at these things make it easier.
For those of you that don't this is kind.
Of what it was like for me and this is.
Not a reenactment of what happened this.
Is just the kind of things that we're.
Going on in my mind while the actual.
Escape room was happening it's probably.
Easier to just watch it take a look okay.
So one last time as we mentioned early.
In the prep room we will be watching you.
So just to reiterate no phones and.
Remember the key to escaping this room.
Is in this box and in order to open it.
You need to figure out the clues leading.
To it do not try to force this or.
Anything else in the room open if it's.
Not opening it's not broken.
You just haven't figured it out yet.
We've had people break things in the.
Past out of frustration and.
Unfortunately we've had to ask them to.
Leave that's not fun for anyone right.
Especially us because then we have to.
Fix it that's all right well if there's.
No other questions i'll be no.
Interesting um what was that you said.
The baqi to escaping this room that.
We're locked in is in that box yet you.
Know that we know that we have to think.
Outside the box to see into it oh okay.
Oh hell if there's no other questions.
For me the timer begins as soon as this.
Door closes good luck and have fun.
Where do we start oh no i mean she just.
Said this is our way out well look on.
The box of some writing or something.
There's only unlock on here oh that.
Means we have to find a key of some sort.
Yeah i'll check the books i got the maps.
I'll get the destiny all right there's.
Definitely gonna be something with his.
Chest with these cups bo does that mean.
I don't know ryan why don't you look at.
The inch right fine right ryan what are.
You doing i think i think i got it got.
What i think i figured it out.
What like the next clue know how we get.
Out of this room ryan you're wasting our.
Time that's impossible.
Yeah we just started guys look remember.
When she came in here to explain the.
Rules yeah what about it when she came.
In wearing all white i started looking.
Around the room for all these other.
White things and all of a sudden i just.
Realized all of the walls around us are.
White and they're surrounding us like.
We're in some kind of institution like.
We're in some kind of box and then right.
As i was meeting that realization she.
Goes and picks up another box and and.
Tries to open it in front of us what is.
Your point guys call me crazy call it a.
Hunch.
Call me maybe but i really think that if.
We want to get out of this box we have.
To figure out what's in that box.
They've been serious yeah why she just.
Told us that oh see told you we should.
Have brought him he's gonna slow us down.
Okay.
Okay she told you guys about the box but.
In order to get it open i noticed that.
There's actually a keyhole.
Yes we know that's the first thing we.
Talked about that's why we're looking.
For hints to find the key actually.
That's not what i was gonna say but if.
You want to find the key i could.
Actually show you guys will we need help.
Actual help gold glow look at that deer.
Or whatever that is oh you mean the.
Sheep head that's not a sheep and sheep.
Same thing oh bison triceratops it's not.
A dinosaur could be its two horns honey.
Dinosaurs what what what are you what.
Are you guys even look we've wasted so.
Much time that we haven't found a single.
Clue yet yeah i got nothing same on the.
Maps they're just random circles.
Everywhere yeah same here.
Yeah i got some different colored water.
Bottles but i don't really know.
Look guys all i'm saying is you guys.
Don't know where to even start i could.
Just get things going and just let you.
Guys know where we buy where do we go.
Huh where do we start well i mean i.
Would start with the hollowed-out book.
What the hollowed-out book next to greg.
Over there you know a third show from.
The top and the right you have a big.
Lettering on it.
Music.
It should be like some kind of.
Wristwatch or something how did you know.
That i mean i could tell you guys but.
Like you said i don't want to waste.
Everybody's time so okay we were wrong.
We're sorry yeah yeah just tell us.
What's next come on yeah okay well that.
Hollowed-out book had a watch which.
Shouldn't be working because when a.
Watch doesn't work you tend to look.
We're at a clock which is also not.
Working so it might appear use this.
Until you see the bottom of the clock.
Which says made in china probably.
Wouldn't think too much into that until.
You realize that this whole room is.
Covered in maps and one of those maps.
Happen to be china now the map of china.
Has a bunch of different cities circled.
But since they provided us with some.
Kind of line graph of some sort with the.
X-axis being the minutes and the y-axis.
Being the hours we can assume that they.
Want us to use the x on the broken clock.
And the broken watch and basically use.
Them as coordinates to find our two.
Cities that are most important clock.
45 mine says 640 it should come.
On to shanghai and beijing then we take.
The broken ruler which is also made in.
China and measure the distance between.
The two and it should come out to about.
Two inches it doesn't have to be an.
Exact measurement you just have to know.
That they're saying two inches they're.
Saying two inches well technically no.
Not two inches two inch s chest oh yeah.
See those weird colored bottles you.
Found earlier they're all different.
Colors but only two of them in the chest.
Or actually the same colors making the.
Two inch s the only couple just like the.
Cup pulls that derek was figuring out.
Earlier and since we now know which.
Colored cup to pour the liquid into we.
Can follow the tube all the way to our.
Last puzzle the instruments and.
Obviously we all know we only mean piano.
So we forget about the other one then we.
Get the shoot music do it what how is it.
Obvious how do we know it's the piano.
The cups they're labeled po remember.
Peel what p o p and old piano you think.
I can't explain that one.
Okay fine but it still doesn't explain.
Why you think it's the last puzzle i.
Mean we knew from the very beginning.
That we're looking for keys right what.
Has more keys than a piano.
Hey guys there's there's a note in here.
Just says to find the key you must play.
The keys using all the keys that led you.
Here in the correct order all the keys.
That led you here correct order what.
Does that mean.
The clues things that led us here the.
Book was the first one oh that's right.
Yeah it's empty on the spine there's a.
Big egg yeah yeah that's how you knew.
Where to start and that thing stands out.
More than a big a plane a key what else.
We have um there's a g in here the g a.
Another egg is that it no nothing.
Happened that was the last clue it led.
Us to the piano all right yeah but maybe.
Try it again but all together all right.
So the order was a g f g a a.
Doesn't it sound like mary had a little.
Bit.
Music.
Music.
I don't know how you did it but i'm.
Impressed well there's only one last.
Thing to do not man you do it you.
Deserve it.
Okay what the hell why would you do that.
We have the key well you need to swallow.
Fine now you guys still don't get it huh.
What look there was never a key in the.
Box to begin with congratulations you.
Guys set a new record from the very.
Beginning she mentioned that the key.
Tore escape was in the box.
She didn't say there was actually a key.
In the box the box was the key why when.
I asked her about thinking outside the.
Box she gave me that weird look remember.
People don't usually pick up on that so.
Fast well i did know something was up.
But i wasn't like absolutely positive.
That i had to break it yet you know.
Because it was two of the rules like.
Don't break things and don't use phones.
Then i started noticing all the random.
Phones in the room and i realized maybe.
Were supposed to break the rule but even.
Then i wasn't absolutely sure until i.
Saw the broken ruler exactly broken rule.
Alert clever rule no this is the.
Stupidest escape room ever hey it's okay.
Man some people just don't know how to.
Think outside the box some people just.
Can't break the rule they just do what.
They're told and you know what we call.
Those people sheep.
Applause.
Yeah you already know it didn't happen.
That way like i said this was kind of.
The fantasy version that was actually.
Going on my head during the escape i'll.
Try to make all these connections and.
Make things work i was overthinking.
Everything this was just to show you the.
Kind of things that were going on in my.
Head while the other guys were doing the.
Real work if you want to see how the.
Escape room actually was in real life i.
Uploaded a blog on higa tv it's just.
Like a real tiny bit more accurate and.
Realistic than the one that you just saw.
Although i will say just thinking about.
The escape room and writing that skit.
You know the one you just saw i actually.
Think i developed a technique that will.
Help you or even experience escapers how.
To get out of any escape room pretty.
Much with the same success rate as me.
100% i'm not just talking in a fantasy.
I'm talking reality because in reality.
That other version would look a little.
Bit more like this nah man you do it you.
Deserve it okay what the hell why would.
You do that.
We have the key paul you need to swallow.
Fine now you guys still don't get it huh.
What why don't you guys take a closer.
Look there was never any key in the box.
To begin with are you serious i just.
That mean we win oh hey i'm sorry but.
I'm gonna have to ask all of you to.
Leave right now oh okay and it's the.
Hell ryan's you you did yeah i do you.
Want.
