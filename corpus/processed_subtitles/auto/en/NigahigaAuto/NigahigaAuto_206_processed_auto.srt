Like when they stab people it's like.
Okay i know you stab a normal person it.
Doesn't go right through them like that.
Or come out as easy yeah well they are.
Decomposed how do you know that because.
I stab people.
All i know is that when steve jobs was.
Around my phone was amazing everything.

Agree with that after he was a lot.
Better it just tim i don't know if tim.
Cook is right you know you know he.
Wasn't the visionary was illegal yeah it.

The science guy well um yeah i mean we.
Got new chairs you know what we should.
Do.
We did get new chairs see this pocket is.
Just coming together dude just coming to.
Getting this better than the other room.
Though realistically it's better than.
The other room i think so.
Because it's bigger yeah the other one i.
Felt like i was stuck in a corner.
Bigger is better as they say what like.
The other day the other day david and i.
We were talking about how we can how.
Things come come to i don't know i guess.
Get society and become like a real thing.
Yeah and we're trying to make up a new.
One we're trying to are the ones we were.
Saying we made up some ridiculous ones.
Like what are some sayings that are like.
That's that's the thing that i always.
Want to look up but i can never find it.
Right and it's got a kiss your fish in.
The water.
Wait did you make that up or is that one.
I made that up right now you gotta catch.
Your fish in the water i mean that i.
Guess i was watching an old like western.
Movie and one of the guys was saying.
They were like old cowboy robbers and.
They were like nah man that was back.
When we were young and we were full of.
Beans i like that one that's a gallon.
Like man that got the beans like he'd if.
He were watching em being do like a slam.
Does that mean though dude or just.
Energy powerful is full of be like his.
Beans are goofy you know maybe energy.
Yeah i don't know yeah or maybe he was.
Filipino filipino philippines latinos.
Oh well but our filipino friends are the.
Ones who made that up it it might be but.
On reg just because you're filipino does.
Not mean that you're full of beans.
I always thought full of evil like if.
You said man that person is full of.
Beans that they were like not telling.
The truth.
Oh yeah that person is full of beans.
Yeah yeah but the way they said it they.
Were talking they were describing it.
Like a compliment like man that was back.
When we were young and full of beans oh.
Like energy i guess beans are this is.
The kind of stuff of energy i know that.
That's what used to eat back in yeah the.
Way.
And so sometimes sometime in society it.
Changed from full energy to full of poop.
You're so full of poop and before that.
Is full of beans yep.
What was it before hey that sounds like.
A full of anything rice yeah so you're.
So full of it dude you're full of beer.
You know but maybe back then when they.
Would use that term you're full of.
Blight maybe it was a great thing like a.
Positive guy yeah compliment you're full.
Of happiness is that bad what full of.
Happy now now i'm like questioning no.
It's it's a bad thing when i say to you.
If i were seeing you like you guys are.
Full of full of they're full of it.
You're full of joy that's a bad thing.
That means you're a bullshitter.
Yeah what if you're full of joy you're.
Still full of it dude i would want to be.
Filled with joy david you're just full.
Of it bro.
You're full of it but what's it though.
It doesn't matter what it is it just.
Means you're full of it like you're.
Alive full of water well there was one.
On what is the one that comes from like.
God is so it sucks when i can't remember.
References but it it comes from see if.
You can figure out what this thing is.
But it comes from the top of them when.
They when you make milk oh the cream of.
The crop that comes from when they make.
Milk or something like that and the top.
Of the milk was known as the the best.
Cream i guess a crop yeah so that's like.
That's where that i had to look it i.
Looked it up because we were asking the.
Girl where does that even come from i'm.
Pretty sure that's that's correct i.
Might be wrong i think you're right.
Thing i googled it and then what is the.
Crop though is it milk it is milk right.
I thought so yeah so maybe in the milk.
When it separates the top is the cream.
And that's the most valuable maybe it's.
Kind of like something here that you.
Know like the foam like what you neal.
Nobody there's a perfect pour as the.
Right amount of foam the hands just.
Enough to just like make that beer.
Experience just amazing new saying you.
Know david do it right what you're the.
Foam of the beer oh damn that does yeah.
That's like oh you got a nuke yo you got.
That version of the car through that's.
The phone with the beard it could be a.
Good.
Thing though bunch too much foam yeah.
It's not good.
Damn this is getting deep when there's.
Right enough.
Oh mike you're the right enough foam.
With the beer the perfect amount of foam.
On that you're the perfect amount of.
Foam on the beer that's like a pickup.
Line.
Hey thanks what are you gonna go to a.
Girl and say hey you know what you're.
You just have the perfect amount of foam.
With the beard that does not sound if i.
Was a girl i would care that and be like.
What can i be my number i kind of like.
You know what is a fun game that we were.
Playing the other night i was like man.
This we should did this in the podcast.
What's that is when you were asking if.
We were doing like the would you rather.
Mmm.
But it was a little r-rated yeah so if.
We were to head out a little bit okay.
All right everybody think of a would you.
Rather and we'll has really good all.
Right options you can start you go next.
And i'll good last why do you get to go.
Last i got to think about would you.
Rather go first or second go ahead this.
Is a completely random one zombie.
Apocalypse would you rather have you.
Always go there a spear all right like a.
Long spear sharp yep durable or or a.
Fire axe like a you know what's a fire i.
Think you know the ones that you see.
Like a fireman's at fireman's axe yeah.
Oh i you know what i've held both okay.
In my life jump out a spear and have.
Iraq's heard i felt i have held both.
Okay and experience referencing the.
Laziness of the people in wally and me.
Wanting to be one of those people i.
Would choose a spear because it's a.
Little lighter honestly smart i would.
Also pick a spear but it's because of.
The distance because they can only harm.
You from touching you sure so if you.
Have a spear i would like in walking.
Dead i think it's easier to pierce them.
Yeah they make it look like they're made.
Of butter in walking dead like when they.
Stab people it's like okay i know you.
Stabbed a normal person it doesn't go.
Right through them like that or come out.
As easy yeah well they are decomposed.
How do you know that because i stabbed.
People.
I.
People yeah here okay how about you acts.
Really because i could chop wood with it.
That is also true.
Zambia luckily we didn't think about.
That but you know what you can't do go.
Spearfishing oh too late you have an axe.
Oh i have axe body spray what if though.
That was the secret we should write up.
We should run a zombie.
No wait zombies are out dude walking day.

Favorite shows we used to all watch it.

We put in our show actually wasn't even.
Thinking about it rather all right okay.
Would you rather well you ready did one.
You can do as many as you want.
David you do one you do one david i was.
Trying to think of one by couldn't i.
Wasn't thinking this whole time i forgot.
Yeah i came up with one but i couldn't.
Come up with the other maybe we can come.
Up with the other okay.
Say would you rather have eight wives in.
Your king-size bed with you every night.
When you go to bed oh eight wives for.
The rest of your life every night okay.
Or blank what so i'm telling you right.
Now i don't even need the other one i.
Don't want that many people in my bed.
That's what my that's you know a lot it.
Would be the rather well why don't why.
Don't you make it worse than one just.
Just say eight other dudes eight why.
Don't know but that's more depends what.
The other is or.
The other dudes yeah three dogs in a.
Twin oh my your bed in your bed all.
Right out of the dogs big dogs you know.
But that's a king-size bed number eight.
People you know how many eight people is.
Like that's how about how about five how.
About four great danes in a set of twins.
And a set of twins yeah babies that will.
Always be babies the rest of their lives.
This is the one of the weirdest yes you.
Got a choose button they're both bad.
Probably take the dogs and babies find.
Six great day oh my god you can't keep.
Changing it fine six great think because.
It's too easy for you two to come up.
With that six great gains in a spare.
Twin so we heard and two puppies have to.
Take care of the babies no just in your.
There just in your bed okay they live.
They this office is raining there always.
Do they cry of course they cry their.
Babies okay then i'm going back to the.
Wives.
Me too crying babies and what kind of.
Wives are they like really nice or they.
Like they're just sleeping oh that's so.
Just the new idea i'd stack them in a.
Pyramid some of them would be snoring.
Some of them it's fine better than.
Crying i have bo i would stack them in a.
Pyramid shape and they're all 500 pounds.
And you just keep changing it down let's.
Have a really nice bed frame i know it's.
True that's true yeah i got a disgusting.
One all right go who would you rather.
Eat a sandwich mm-hmm that the meat in.
It is dog poop oh yeah or or you have to.
Eat a rot in like a super expired taco.
Like that the meat is all disgusting and.
Moldy and like the lettuce and the.
Cheese is all like super old i mean.
That's a mean scientifically there is.
Both just filled with bacteria yeah.
Organisms mm-hmm science that can.
Definitely damage your body and.
Potentially kill you but you have to.
Pick one it's a mental thing at this.
Point.
They're both disgusting i would go to.
The taco.
I go to talk with you this is i know it.
Came from food it wasn't yeah okay.
You're gonna get sick either way but you.
Know what i think the poop would just.
Try out you're gonna try the poop even.
Though you don't know but yeah it would.
Be dry versus like all's grind spory.
Yeah you gotta think she's kind of in.
The sandwich yeah only one ingredient is.
Disgusting which is what doc boom all.
Right everything else is a fresh bread.
Fresh there's lettuce and tomato fresh.
Cheese yes a sandwich a simple disaster.
Yeah mustard dijon yeah regular whatever.
You want can i put it how big is the.
Piece poop it's like it's much like you.
Know if you take a piece of roast beef.
Yeah it would be like a couple pieces or.
Maybe like a short ride this is exactly.
Why we have more megameters dry or it.
Can be wet oh gosh so it's better if you.
Went to subway that only served ugh it's.
Okay to be cleared dog poop and not cat.
Poop because cat poop is has a crazy.
Like dog poop salary stench to it okay.
From experience of smelling dog poop.
Sandwich you know what i might take the.
Dog poop because i i know that with food.
That has spoiled yeah.
It's extremely dangerous and you could.
Die from like salmonella poisoning.
Really yeah you could die you know if.
You know any a food poisoning yeah.
That's just from eating like a little.
Bit of like young guy but imagine if it.
Was sitting there for like you're still.
On the year spoiled taco yep.
Rather die dude rather enjoy that.
Sandwich there's that game and that was.
I like that game.
It'll get better as we get better at it.
Yeah well next time we'll be prepared.
For it we're new is using thinking about.
New be podcast trips well i was trying.
To think of it but it is a tough part is.
Keeping it clean mm-hmm but maybe it.
Doesn't have to we can do we can do.
Clean ones that are interesting why.
Don't you do a vote what do you think.
People would say keep it clean or keep.
It keep it dirty i think it's a dirty.
They would but it's but like what's the.
Point if everything gets like.
Age-restricted injury sponsor this is.
What this is what that is well that as.
Well but that's not even the issue is.
The age restriction yeah it's youtube's.
Got into this place.
Mmm we always end up oh yeah it always.
See the fact that we are even talking.
About this.
Shows what's wrong with you - that's.
Deep right it is it's true though.
Because yeah i never used to feel like.
This even writing anything like i was.
Always clean yeah like consciously but.
Like i never felt like i couldn't be.
Yourself yeah where it's like and they.
Promote the whole be yourself thing they.
Do promote that but it's like okay well.
Be yourself would be the the self that.
We want exactly yeah the fact that it's.
So that's is even that it's exhausting.
To talk about shows you there's a.
Problem with it yeah there's no way we.
Could do that would you rather as we did.
Last night without.
Me there's no way yeah yeah what's new.
We you need a new platform so do we want.
To talk about youtube not really do you.
Want to talk about you - we can talk.
About it but i don't want to buy you -.
Everybody's always just complaining you.
I'm american they forced us to hide.
Their nose it you know what i tried.
Deleting it from my phone you can't but.
Every time i go i turn on my bluetooth.
In my car yuichi starts playing and i'm.
Like this what is this great music.
That's playing what is this great music.
That's not an epistle actually i'm very.
Yeah i really don't like the fact that.
It's playing like otto plays and michael.
Yeah it's i don't know what you do it's.
Upsetting stop using apple yeah anyway.
Products yeah just shows everyone is.
Biased and they have their own agendas.
To push myself you're just talking about.
Like the whole apple thing the other day.
And like we were comparing like the.
Sides of like you can see it from.
Apple's perspective or like we were.
Talking about how we'll see yeah and.
Also how it they i think they tried to.
Like literally stop the market of.
Third-party repairs and they like they.
Would like sue these other small.
Companies that were doing that and i.
Know there's a youtuber online that like.
Shows all the information of like he.
Takes apart apple products and says like.
They were gonna charge you $600 for this.
It literally cost $2 and this is how you.
Do it and they were trying to take it.
Down mm-hmm but on the flip side with.
The other argument is that because apple.
Is you know they want to control your.
Experience right which is good and a bad.
Thing right it's it's positive because.
They they maintain a very high quality.
Level of service product design all.
These things and they want people to.
Join their world and say hey we have.
This amazing experience that you can.
Have going to the apple genius bar these.
Products are 100% you know tested in our.
Facilities right with our highest.
Quality of standards whereas these third.
Parties may take a shortcut they may you.
Know find the same part in china that's.
You know super cheap but on the other.
Side not everyone can afford these.
Ridiculous prices.
Yeah i was a repair so i can see kind of.
Both sides mm-hmm right you know what do.
You think about that no i just we were.
Talking about the other day oh really.
Like off like somewhere i mean i get it.
Nicely politicize too.
Yeah but i mean i just no matter what.
Yeah i think no matter what though like.
With anything not just apple youtube.
Everything no you can't satisfy everyone.
Yeah and the thing is most people don't.
Think in the same way where we're.
Thinking from their perspective and like.
If you were to from a business person's.
Perspective but put yourself in their.
Shoes if you're starting a business or.
You're doing things a certain way.
I mean if you really believe you know.
What's best and start your own business.
Goal rival apple if you know that much.
Yeah i think that's i mean you can.
Complain as much as we want about.
Youtube and stuff but if they're not.
Willing to change that's why i've.
Stopped trying to change there's no way.
You can change you too they're too big.
Right so if they want to make it this.
Way you have to adjust it sucks but the.
Only way we can show we can do anything.
About it is either people stop using it.
Cuz it's not good or there's a.
Competitor right and they're just so big.
It's hard to compete with the company.
That's generating billions of dollars.
They have a monopoly on this system i'm.
On both sides i but i i would yeah i get.
It certainly for me i'm actually a.
Little more on the other side as far as.
The experience mm-hmm because i mean.
First off i am an apple fanboy but i.
Also the reason why i am is because i.
Actually love their products now do they.
Charge a ton of money for like their.
Laptops and their phones yes they do it.
Is more expensive and but they've done.
An amazing job of branding in marketing.
Which is what which is a little bit that.
That doesn't hold that much weight.
Because marketing can mean it's all.
About like kind of manipulation right in.
A way but i do think that apple products.
Like because i guess i come from like.
The artistic side right and creative.
Side like when i see an apple product.
Versus anything else for me personally i.
See it as like oh wow this is a.
Beautiful thing like yeah it's clean.
It's clean it's consistent and i guess.
That aligns with like my.
Which you somewhat ocd kind of like but.
He's oh yeah like even like i think cuz.
I for me even just walking around you.
Know like town square or a mall or.
Something and you see an apple store it.
Just looks so clean yeah and for me i.
Personally hate the heat something like.
That looks so cleaning cold i just want.
To go in there you know what hold it.
It's not a warm that kind of place it's.
Not a warm place it's like always leak.
Very sleek i know it's gonna be cold in.
There so that's where i go if it was.
Always freezing i grew up like if i grew.
Up in the arctic then i would probably.
Go into something that looks more like a.
Warm home they're like hollister yeah.
Even though holidays are really cold but.
It looks like a house yeah something.
More like bright and i guess i don't.
Know what's a warm looking store like i.
Think hollister is pretty good looks.
Like a log cabin but it's very dark.
Though and dark looks cold - that's your.
Abercrombie & fitch that's another.
That's the same thing do you mean the.
Buy warm store i could say orange.
Brownish yeah yeah yeah that's just a.
Visual that's a visual my cycle it's.
Psychology yeah so yeah like going back.
To that i just i'm a big fan of it i.
Know people are gonna disagree me like.
No like samsung's better and whatnot you.
Know what i've seen samsung phones are.
Great mm-hmm actually technology wise.
There are a lot more advanced in a lot.
Of ways right they actually like try to.
Improve and do all these things but once.
You do too much of that it may allow.
Other people other you know there's too.
Many ideas in that phone in my opinion.
And in just the general direction and is.
What what i'm talking about.
Right i don't you mean hey and and it.
Gets a little clunky and a little bit.
Like what so what are you guys exactly.
What what are you trying to i know what.
You're trying to do but like where's.
Your identity that's how my mind works.
Right i think once some of these other.
Competitors they start branding better.
And they have more of a design sense in.
Terms of like the product and the way.
That they package everything together.
That's that's a type of thing i have.
Appreciation for oh yeah i mean i.
Literally just went through like getting.
The apple watch and so i went through.
Like the looking through the market and.
Seemed like what am i other opportunity.
Or other options i guess yeah and it was.
Basically just like either do android.
Mm-hmm or you do smart walk or the apple.
Watch hmm and i will say after i went.
And got the apple watch the packaging.
And everything like i opened it i was.
Like this is pretty sick like just.
Opening it i was like yeah and they.
Really control that whole expansion to.
Detail which is i appreciate like you.
Said that coming from like an artistic.
Minds yeah like perspective like even.
Like on the back side you know they had.
Like a print on the inside that you.
Couldn't even see until you open it it.
Was just very that part was very and.
It's consistent with all not just their.
Watch but like yeah product yeah i sound.
Like a apple sales guy right now.
Would you say that so it's interesting.
Because and i just thought about this.
Now but like wouldn't so you're kind of.
Saying that samsung is met like in a way.
It's messier and apple is cleaner right.
That's what you're saying kinda to a.
Certain degree when you look at it i.
Usually i kind of am right but they're.
Okay so so i made my point for apple and.
Their beauty and all that right the.
Other side that i think is great about.
You know companies like google and you.
Know basically android phones is that.
They they push innovation right and and.
They actually allow people to kind of.
Freely be creative and do their own.
Things as opposed to conforming to what.
Apple's brand standards are right right.
Like so apple says we built this you.
Need to build according to this yeah.
Right mm-hmm the google kind of mindset.
Is like hey this is an open field you be.
As creative as you want you build.
Whatever you want and in here you go.
My thing is i wish that there was a.
Company that literally promotes both of.
Those it's hard but i mean like in a.
Sense of like it's an open thing but the.
Experience is still very important and.
Like the sleek look and something like.
That you know i mean i don't i.
The problem i have is like it's very.
Much one or the other you know it's like.
Red and blue.
You know take the red pill or the blue.
Pill yep she's a red side or the blue.
Side but i was really excited for.
Google's modular phone i don't think.
They're do any more pics not the picture.
I don't remember what it was but it was.
Like i remember there was like a very.
Big buzz about having like a phone where.
Instead of replacing the phone you.
Replaced upgraded components almost like.
A motherboard in a computer oh i see.
Yeah and so it would reduce electronic.
Waste and it would reduce like the.
Consumers cost because they didn't have.
To continually so i was like oh we came.
Out with a 30 megapixel camera.
You know here buy it and then you just.
Pop it out like a card and you punch it.
Back in and you essentially just.
Upgraded your phone to a certain degree.
Yeah i don't i i see it why you won't.
Make as much money yeah because you're.
Not forcing the consumer to buy an.
Actual phone right the entire thing so.
Business from a business perspective it.
Would make no it wouldn't make as much.
Sense because why would i want to.
Upgrade it if i'm if i have this right.
Well yeah i mean i'm not saying it's.
Gonna make money i was just saying like.
For me personally that i'd but it is.
Cool yeah yeah like that is like an.
Innovative idea that pushes the industry.
You know yeah yeah it does it does which.
Is why i think some people had like.
Problems with apple because i feel like.
In the beginning they were very much.
Like an innovative idea steve jobs was.
Around yeah and now it's just kind of.
Like like you were saying they've kind.
Of scaled back to just the experience or.
Having like this brand that they keep.
Consistent which is still pretty pretty.
Cool and it's it is kind of like it is a.
Slightly more shallow type of thing you.
Know the branding and all that i mean.
It's very important because the branding.
It's more of a psychological thing yeah.
The actual innovation of technology i.
Think you know android and google is.
That they've done a much better job of.
Like pushing that yeah and then apple.
Just kind of copies what they did right.
Yeah but they perfect it yeah packaged.
It better so so yeah at the end of the.
Day androids a lot better another thing.
Is weird too is like when i was thinking.
Like do i want to switch to android.
Mm-hmm.
No out because everyone has i phones if.
I were the only one that doesn't have.
One well in our group yeah like a.
Message for what we do i think it's.
Easier but if we all were to switch or.
Say you were like the minority right.
With a iphone i think it's an easy.
Switch you mean iphone to android no i.
Think the only reason i'm still getting.
Iphones is because it's easier it's got.
A everyone already has it cuz they've.
Created this whole ecosystem they did.
Yeah that's brilliant yeah and you look.
At really you look at imessage for.
Example yeah if you text each other i'm.
With imessage i'm on iphones it's a nice.
Blue and white or blue and gray kind of.
Messaging visual but when you message.
With anyone outside of apple you get.
This like neon green thing that just.
Yeah look good it's like kind of ugly.
And android they do it on purpose and.
It's color of droid i hate that i think.
They do it on purpose i mean yeah it's a.
Brilliant idea to click like you said an.
Ecosystem that's a very good word to do.
And i hate it yeah i'm in it i'm stuck.
In it yeah yeah they got us on a hook.
Yeah.
So they can do things that i hate and i.
Will still be loyal because i mean not.
Loyal i have to it's just out of.
Convenience yeah i like the whole like.
When a new phone comes out i don't know.
There was a study i don't know if it's.
True or not but i personally know for a.
Fact that always happens like every time.
When you phone comes out my phone for.
Whatever reason i would say the last.
Four phones consistently get slower and.
Maybe i think there was a study or.
Something about it.
Maybe it's an update they released i.
Don't know what it is but whenever like.
It's not my phone it's not that old.
Well didn't a police a statement saying.
They do slow down older phones they do.
They do and the reason being is because.
You know because then because with the.
New phone right the hardware you have to.
Release new software right and software.
Generally gets better right it doesn't.
Get more slimmed down it gets bulkier.
Right so when you have a bulky or.
Software with more features and more.
More tools and different you know.
Powerful phone can't handle it your.
Phone can't handle it because it's not.
As powerful as right.
New phone that comes ok so so when you.
Come out with the new software right you.
Have an old phone the old phones.
Hardware can't keep up with the software.
So it disables certain things in the.
Hardware sure or in the software or vice.
Versa right that so so it forces you to.
But that's my point though like that's.
My point like the fact that they're.
Releasing this every single and there's.
Not much change they could have you know.
For a fact that apple has so many things.
That they're currently working on that's.
Not gonna be in the in the next phone.
Yeah i think they hold stuff back and.
They're doing it because they want to.
Release more phones because they know.
That you have to get the next one.
Because your phone is gonna slow down.
And can't handle it when they could have.
Easily done something that they could.
Have released a version that could.
Handle the next update if not then why.
Don't they have somebody thinking about.
That like why don't they have somebody.
Like saying because everybody's.
Complaining about it there's other.
Conspiracies about how they're doing.
This to your phones yeah like they are.
Aware of the problem they've already.
Addressed it i think it's less about.
That it's more about its it's like if.
You had a restaurant right and then you.
Decide to change so you had customers.
Coming for a decade.
They're so used to like everything on.
The menu and the way that the chairs.
Feel and then one day they're like ok.
You know what from a business.
Perspective we got to evolve with the.
Times where people are getting more.
Sophisticated you know we don't want to.
Just serve this like this the same.
Patrons that come into our you know a.
Restaurant we want the young kids to.
Come but our place looks old yeah so.
Bringing in all these new furniture but.
You can't really do half in half because.
It's just gonna be weird with the.
Branding and all that but if you if you.
Have the same you know if you bring in a.
Bunch of new furniture and make it look.
More hip because you want to draw the.
Audience and the old people you know.
They're gonna complain because it's not.
As a hip and forward-thinking so that's.
That's the difference though this is not.
Like when you're going into this.
Restaurant for the old people mm-hmm.
Like they're not they're not allowed to.
Like you can still go there for free.
Mmm like you're not being forced to do.
Something that you don't want to do yeah.
Like it's not like the it's it's not.
Like you're destroying that restaurant.
You have my analogy is and then making.
You pay for another play.
Yeah but like their what they're doing.
Is they're saying like hey you bought.
This from us right yeah no no it doesn't.
Work the same way yeah but you have to.
Upgrade you can't not upgrade right.
Eventually it makes you upgrade yeah if.
They were to let you just let your form.
Work the way it is like it my my phone.
Worked the way it did yeah.
Like how i bought it and how it was.
Intended to work mm-hmm i don't care let.
Me you can have the coolest stuff the.
Next one i'll get the next one after.
That maybe yeah but the fact that.
They're making you get this product the.
Next product because they ruin your.
Other your previous product but they're.
Not really is a response but they're not.
Really making you fit whether or not.
They are making you because they're.
There if it switch to android well.
That's what i mean but like out of.
Convene it's it's messed that's why i'm.
Saying it's messed up but like i didn't.
I have to stay with they're.
Intentionally making the product you.
Bought like obsolete so that you have to.
Say no i don't i don't think it's that.
No no that's what you're saying like i.
Don't mean if it's not even if it's not.
Intentional they're not they don't care.
Because about their you know they're.
Because her in does he care about moving.
Consumers they care about improving.
Technology they care about not being.
Stuck in the past but like moving on to.
Better and newer things because that's.
What their job is right but it's you.
Know they're doing it on purpose because.
Like you said i mean yeah considering.
You're developing an app you know that.
When they put an update yeah they are.
Forcing other people who have apps to.
Conform to their update yeah so because.
You suck it could be just as simple to.
Help to fix ryan's problem would be if.
You have a phone that's let's say the.
Six it caps at a certain update so that.
Then when you don't upgrade into the.
Next software to mess up your phone so.
You could say like well you could buy a.
Six but it only goes up to software xyz.
Right and so it won't it won't get.
Messed up but usually few features of.
The new one so they do they do do that.
Within the software itself they have to.
But i guess i mean i'm not an engineer.
But from what i understand is if you.
Create how do i explain this so if you.
Create a new software update it's.
Addressing certain bugs but it's also.
Helping the new phone it's a it's a.
Software that fits into the hardware of.
The new phones that come out right right.
New and better better better and faster.
And more powerful right an overall.
Update it's an overall update now for.
Apple to spend their resources and their.
Engineering power on creating and they.
Do already have this they have an iphone.
16 right now right for all the iphones.
Right even though we're on iphone 10.
Right but then how long are they gonna.
Keep this going and have people fix bugs.
That are still appearing in time from.
Six they want to move on to the next.
Phones they want to get it more so what.
You're saying is wendy so the bugs that.
They're fixing right and like on the.
Iphone which are always there yeah yeah.
They're always there but like if you're.
Satisfied with how your phone is when.
You buy it yeah which you know if it can.
Run that way can they maintain that that.
Current farm even with the bugs that are.
Currently there but that's what you.
Bought like that's what the phone is.
That's fine so the thing with the.
Convenient een so here's the thing so.
From apple's perspective why would they.
Put spend millions and millions of.
Dollars more into a software into a team.
That just cares about that's what i'm.
Asking because they need an.
Accessibility because they don't make up.
Money then they would they need another.
Team they need another so then that's.
Then that's what i'm saying yeah it.
Makes no sense financial then what they.
Should do is i mean i guess it then it.
Becomes this point is at what point like.
Is there really if they really wanted to.
So by this logic why not just release a.
New phone every month and force you to.
Why a new phone they do health software.
But not know but why not just a new.
Phone every month and you'd force it's.
Too expensive exactly but for a lot of.
People it's too expensive already.
Because of how frequently they're.
Releasing phones and that's the point.
They need to make something that and.
This is only i mean you don't have to do.
Whatever they want yeah but i'm saying.
Like the more this happens and the more.
Frequently this happens the more i'm.
Gonna try and compete the campaign yeah.
Until people like i'm ready to switch.
I'm until all my friends and then as far.
As apple's perspective is if they don't.
Release phones at this rate yeah then.
They have to lay people off yeah which.
Is fine like this.
If that's the way they're gonna yeah if.
That's the way they're gonna be like.
Their company yeah i get it like i.
Understand it but that's just how it.
Works like if you people can't afford it.
And it keeps coming out like we're.
Fortunate that we can afford it but if.
It keeps coming out what's stopping them.
From going every single month and the.
Next time the next month it comes out.
Your phone starts getting slower after.
That your phone gets even slower than.
That like there's nothing stopping them.
Other than it's not a good idea now it's.
It's like you know i'll go back to the.
Restaurant analogy let's say you're max.
Max capacity every night right and you.
Hire people and then you're you've hired.
Enough people to to have a good business.
Right it comes down to capitalism right.
Do you want to create more jobs for.
People.
Mm-hmm right if you're at the top of.
This restaurant in your max capacity.
Every night and you're you make a.
Certain amount of money right it's like.
Should this company be able to open.
You're not worried they're not worried.
About other people they're worried about.
Themselves no that's what i mean yeah.
They're not worried about people losing.
Their jobs um trust they're not worried.
About it don't worry but it would happen.
No because if you really were worried.
About and you weren't being selfish what.
You would do is what you exactly what.
You said you create another team right.
It cost them more money yeah but it'll.
Keep their people happy people like me.
And will that will have the oath not.
Just me and will but like i'm saying.
Like for this is my example yeah yeah.
They would create another team which.
Creates more jobs cost them more money.
Right but it's like are they the ones.
They're gonna lose money but they're.
People are hacked their customers are.
Happier i think this goes into a much.
Deeper conversation about capitalism so.
Like let's say you have this restaurant.
Right and you were doing your making um.
Ten million dollars a year right they.
Could open another restaurant another.
Chain and open another one and then they.
Can open a franchise and become the next.
In and out the next chick-fil-a the next.
Whatever that depends on their goal now.
With this phone company do they want to.
Just be a mom-and-pop like phone shop or.
Do they want to compete with samsung and.
All these other companies do they want.
To change the world sure they want to.
Have influence over a country do they.
Want to influence around the world and.
Who doesn't want and be in and kind of.
Have you know create create this like.
Brand that's rep.
Since america and american goods right.
That gives you influence and power over.
All the other countries in terms of.
Technology you want to be a leader in.
That you can't be a leader if you don't.
Expand and if you don't expand you're.
Not generating more revenue of course.
And you can't you will never have that.
That sort of it's a balancing act yeah.
But what i'm saying is and they're.
Getting to the point where i think.
They're not gonna generate more revenue.
They can't they're done right now.
Actually so as far as phones mm-hmm most.
People in the they've already kind of.
Like maxed out the number of people who.
Can buy phones from apple because.
Everyone has iphones but i mean like.
There's always gonna be kids and people.
Growing like there's populations.
Increasingly yeah yeah but not not at.
The rate where it's like what's worth it.
That's why right now they're focusing on.
Software upgrades as opposed to hardware.
Right right because everybody already.
Has an iphone so you're like how often.
You know but you just sit like oh i.
Guess if they're at the maximum like the.
Perfect device which doesn't exist then.
That one can handle the most updates.
Like the because you're not building new.
Phones yeah i have to build a new phone.
It's because they have updates that.
Can't be handled there's there's a rest.
Of things so are they done making new.
Phones i don't think they are.
Oh no no no they're never done making.
New phones but yeah but they're having.
Like within the latest iphone that came.
Out yeah you had the least amount of.
Buzz because everyone has an iphone like.
I'll wait it out for the next next next.
Next right cuz i'm happy wait wait you.
Can't though because when the next one.
Comes out your phone's not gonna stop.
Working once you update yeah i think.
That's what i'm saying that's um i would.
Say this is somewhat of a simple.
Solution but it's kind of like a.
Compromise between them having a team.
And the team moving on or whatever it.
May be.
Yeah but when they have a phone in the.
Beginning when you buy a brand new phone.
It has bugs and people are like yeah fix.
This fix this and then in like a year.
Later maybe two years later it gets to a.
Point where it works good and you want.
To keep it the exact way it is even if.
It has like maybe one bug here it's very.
Solid doable yeah yeah there's a problem.
When it switches over to the new phone.
That everyone complains again or says.
Screw it i'm gonna buy a new phone there.
Needs to be a way to like solidify so.
So in that zone that phone will not slow.
Down if you don't upgrade - oh - what my.
Knots really buggy.
I don't even update that when you don't.
Update 100% that's all we're talking.
About actually okay there's something to.
Be said about that that's probably true.
In some ways yeah because at that point.
Apple is already invested in improving.
Their overall system the backend not.
Necessary that one update yeah iphone 6.
Software but the entire back-end.
Infrastructure because they need to grow.
Right to make better things they may.
Know ar as a future and they need to.
Build and hoarding lea now that doesn't.
Make sense maybe it does slow down a.
Little bit yeah yeah but that's the.
Problem is for the consumers like i see.
Where ryan well ryan says about if i buy.
A phone at this one point and it's.
Working up to the standards that you as.
A consumer want it - mm-hmm.
It's kind of like i would say again the.
Word i'm using a slimy that the company.
Isn't really like doing something.
Actively for that for that specific.
Problem right and the reason is you know.
It's money they want you to essentially.
It's not as you can't argue against it.
The earlier you don't upgrade your phone.
It's just not a priority well they.
Should just disclose yeah hey this phone.
Only lasts a year until it starts.
Slowing down you know what that the same.
Problem it's the same exact problem that.
Every phone company has whether your.
Apple or android samsung it's the same.
Thing it apple just gets that that sort.
Of you know well i don't i don't know.
That because yeah it's no it is because.
That's how software i can't even say.
That agree with that because i don't.
Know yeah i don't yeah i'm speaking from.
Personal experience because there's no.
There was no release telling us this.
Until recently right and i always.
Suspect it i always i called it out in.
Videos a long time ago and then this.
Article came out within the last i don't.
Know year or so yeah cuz some heart did.
Some harvard study or something like.
That but i when that came out i was not.
I was shocked even though i knew it was.
Happening i just didn't know that's just.
A conspiracy i'm just it's in my head.
Like yeah yeah you know but it makes.
Sense cuz i'm like man i have to spend.
Money again i just got this could i i.
Don't get phone when they just come out.
Yeah yeah i mean i just got i forget.
When it was and could have been the five.
Or six it just like it just came out.
Like well i'm standing and then two.
Months later next week and my phone.
Stopped working because for me there's.
No excuse that this phone that's one.
Soul should stop working for that price.
Yeah well that's that's a different.
That's it probably the phone itself but.
Like for example i'm honest i've known.
Seven okay my phone works completely.
Fine and are now yes update for now so.
For me i'm like i know some people have.
That problem of where their slows down a.
Lot yeah.
But why not me maybe maybe just for your.
Phone i don't know see so that's why.
Maybe it's not maybe it is but it's just.
In your not slowing down it's not really.
It's fast enough for me too.
So then what we're saying that it's not.
Then it is just they have faulty.
Products like a lot of it could be that.
It could be that because most people i.
Know agree with what we're talking about.
Mine what really creeped me out was mine.
Only started messing up i mean this is.
Gonna sound like huge conspiracy yeah.
Mine only started like getting really.
Glitchy when they started having new.
Releases and i was watching videos on.
The new phones and radix and that's when.
I was like this is weird but that's.
There is like i mean there's already.
Talked about that with whole like alexa.
And that's amazon and yeah google home.
And there's already like things again.
And your phone there's that sunspear see.
And it's and it's been proven and i'm.
People have tested it yeah like not.
Simple like slow down i'm talking like i.
Would type i'd be typing that's.
Facebook's thing and it wouldn't type.
And then it would go that's what i had.
Anyone like and they would type like.
Really fast yeah it would and it would.
Like interesting and there was otherwise.
Just didn't work i never had that.
Problem and i try to push the off let.
That sleep button and it wouldn't do it.
And then like two minutes later it would.
Go to sleep and then come up again i've.
Had that i've had that one yeah it was.
Only after i started and then i started.
Thinking it was like how sick would it.
Be i mean this is gonna be really.
Concerned if they did on purpose if.
There's a team yeah at google that of.
Saw 15 apple i mean excuse me at apple.
That are in charge of writing code to.
Bug your phone like that would be i mean.
I honestly make you sick honestly i.
Would not even if i heard that now be.
Like man that's messed up but like.
They've already been doing it.
In my head like i know like i mean until.
There's a better i don't think they have.
Teams that do that in my opinion i don't.
Think either horrible press really like.
Right but i mean there are some.
Conspiracy.
Obviously never gonna get caught what i.
Will secret but i will say that that.
They are aware yeah of what that would.
Do and maybe there are some problems.
That all i know is that when steve jobs.
Was around my phone was amazing.
Everything was great about it i would.
Say i i would agree with that after he.
Was a lot better it just tim i don't.
Know if tim cook is right you know yeah.
He wasn't the visionary he was i don't.
Know i mean i i just know my own.
Personal experiences yeah i don't know.
Like that ike ike for all i know i could.
Be talking about of my whole maybe necks.
On holly uh maybe the next upgrades we.
Have to switch to android together to.
Experience it maybe but that's that's.
The thing i would have to convince all.
Of you guys and my phones i do it unless.
Like me give me like two or three years.
On this let's watch yeah and then you.
Like your watch right i love it until.
They release the next one yeah this is.
The most brand-new one and i was like.
Okay this has about maybe two years.
Right which is sad conspiracy wait so.
Like okay like would you guys want to.
Keep the same exact phone for how long.
Like until you get tired of it and you.
Want to improve generally because you're.
Not because you're forced but alright.
Your own preference i think when it.
Would naturally break down or in turn.
There's features where i feel like holy.
Crap that's so awesome i'm gonna upgrade.
Yeah saying normally the the phone one.
Phone away is not big enough maybe like.
Two three phones away is a holy crap i.
Need to get anything like use for.
Universe i would say how about three to.
Three to five three or five because like.
The phone should still work and i know.
They used to work that long before yeah.
Why all of a sudden after like see this.
Is all i know it's not the phone when i.
Got my last phone like i said i got it.
Late i think it was the five i got the.
Five really late and they were just had.
Released the six like two months later.
That's what my phone start getting super.
Buggy a brand new phone and you know.
It's not the phone honest it's just that.
One and it's unfortunate it worked.
Perfectly right when that other one came.
Out.
I don't remember if i updated right away.
Or not i probably i probably updated it.
I probably just did it.
It got so bad everything was like what.
Will is talking about i think it was the.
Five going to the six it also be the six.
Going to the seven but regardless i was.
Like okay well i know for a fact because.
I used to think okay maybe the phones.
Just kind of you know maybe they.
Overheat over like a year and then i.
Kind of break down but that wasn't the.
Case i was a brand if it was a brand new.
Two months in brand new phone same with.
What they were talking about with the.
Battery life did you hear that someone.
Tried to sue them so now they have to.
Like if your phone dies in the first.
Like one of my my cousin actually had to.
Do this her phone basically you in like.
A couple hours we'll go from a hundred.
Percent to like 20 percent brand-new.
It's like the new i fo she's got a bad.
Battery yeah so so now they're because.
They're getting sued not you can go to.
Any apple store and tell them matter.
Yeah yeah you can get a free chain but.
Like no one had know one thing you got.
To do it before the end of this.
Something something like that but i.
Think if had no one tried to sue them do.
You think they would offer that probably.
Not of course not because they don't.
Care about like oh because it wasn't a.
Big deal to them because no one really.
Don't know i'm late as much yeah because.
People thought like oh maybe it's just.
Like i'm using it and my phone's getting.
Old that's what i used to say but then i.
Realized that's not that's not how the.
Phones they don't they don't die that.
Fast right.
Only when the next ones coming up yeah.
And that's only for one reason to make.
More money to make you buy it the next.
Thing and that's why i think is messed.
Up.
I think there's more than just that i.
Think it's more than just money i think.
It's about influence it's about power.
It's like if this if apple didn't have.
Power it wasn't one of its power yes i.
Formed them so the way that i see it is.
If if it wasn't apple yeah it's gonna be.
Someone else and don't watch that what.
It does what is the leader in in phones.
In soft wind phone technology right so.
It's if it's gonna be so i want someone.
Else to do that then i want someone to.
Have more influence because everybody.
Needs a competitor yeah or else things.
Become for me kind of a monopoly yeah.
Absolutely and for me it's like you know.
Who would i want to be bigger as a hi.
Murder i know i keep talking about food.
Ferb's love looks like i don't mind that.
In and out yeah is massive okay i.
Wouldn't mind actually if they took over.
The world because i just like me into no.
No but what if like when i want them to.
Take over there's a difference what if.
They do take over the hamburger industry.
Yeah and i would be fine because much no.
But they have a high standard say they.
Double a triple their prices yeah you.
Would still support them no no no no of.
Course not exactly it's the same thing.
But i know that they have higher.
Standard of hamburgers than like they do.
When like a mcdonald's sure but let's.
Say mcdonald's kept their prices do you.
Think they'd be able to take back in and.
Out if in and out is apple in my eyes.
Mcdonald's is android yeah okay no okay.
Well let's say for example right yeah i.
Think so for me in and out just uses.
Higher quality you're just doing an.
Analogy yeah it's just okay so just as.
In the example yeah what i'm saying is.
If they were a trip with their prices.
Because they can cuz they know how good.
They are and let's say they're doing.
Better than mcdonald's.
Yes significantly so they have such a.
Huge fan base apple right and they.
Tripled their prices mm-hmm right or.
They kept raising it more and more and.
More how what is that what apple's doing.
Though that in a way they are because.
They are making you buy and you they're.
Increasing the revenue they're becoming.
More powerful sure right so at what.
Point do all these in and out fancy you.
Know what this is a great product but.
Screw these guys are greedy hmm you know.
Ob is in a big new hamburgers they're.
All great i you got a stay there cuz.
They're so good but at what point is.
Maybe they need depending - i need.
Another company another competitor came.
Around and they're almost as good bond.
There's something yeah one-third the.
Price that's great why wouldn't you.
Support all of course but that doesn't.
That's just right now that's what i'm.
Saying we need that in a no is not apple.
No in and out if you are looking in and.
Out yeah they have kept the same thing.
Because they know it's good you know.
What i mean it's high quality they have.
Their own farms but they have the cows.
They haven't like tried to like get you.
To pay for a little little bit more and.
They can keep increase enterprise you.
Know i mean like stereotypically in and.
Out right you got a picture.
In your head as a person as a compliment.
I would think it's like some old farmer.
Guy who's just like wah just been making.
The same thing for a hundred years i'm.
Not gonna change it and i'm gonna charge.
You a dollar you know what david was.
Just using that as his analogy because.
He loves it yes yeah yeah and that's.
Great no and i love mcdonald's for their.
Own reasons yeah but i just know that as.
Far as the ingredients i think i was.
Talking more ingredients.
Yeah quality quality of ingredients with.
Mcdonald's versus in and out is a world.
Of a difference.
Sure less processed you know that type.
Of thing yeah in terms like the yeah.
Like the raising of the prices and you.
Know having people like the money part.
I'm not the money part see there that's.
The difference because there's so many.
Burger places back in the box whatever.
Burger king that they can't afford to do.
That the reason why apple cans because.
They have such a stranglehold the weight.
The reason why youtube can do what they.
Do is because they have a stranglehold.
On the market and that's the difference.
And that's why i say there needs to be.
Competition bar is low to fur to create.
A hamburger joint versus a phone company.
Well it's yeah it's yeah there's not.
Many competitors yeah that's why i was.
So excited for like that modular phone.
Because if you think of like all the.
People who are upset like i don't want.
To buy a new phone every year it's like.
Yeah that is kind of a solution yeah.
Here's like a base processor or a phone.
Right.
You just have to upgrade the parts right.
So it is essentially kind of a solution.
To that that bubble or whatever in the.
Market of people who don't want to do.
That but i think the only thing about.
The modular phone is like you know what.
What can you upgrade in that i don't.
Know i looking at it i just thought it.
Was like a very cool exciting would yeah.
That's a cool idea but it's i like to.
Execute that because like if your phone.
Comes let's just say they come to the.
Screen yeah right and then you have you.
Can upgrade every other piece but the.
Screen right then it's kind of like now.
I need to get a new screen again well.
Maybe that's why i think google stopped.
The project or maybe they maybe they.
Reached a dead end and said like it's.
Not really feasible right now right.
Something like the idea is great yeah.
Concept itself like having something.
That on the market that's an alternative.
You know it's like yeah like an.
Attachment yeah and something like that.
Would be very new and very exciting.
Almost like a invent reinventing the.
Smartphone and i do remember you're.
Right about that phone and like i oh.
Still it's like politics right zette as.
I get over this even when it's proven.
Yeah.
I'm under the spell me too it's not even.
A spell i'm committed because everyone.
Else is you know does that make sense.
I literally have yeah it's a good.
Product until they update until a new.
Phone comes on yeah yeah i agree it's.
Like when you first get it and it's new.
Even with bugs it's like holy crap the.
Fact that this is a real thing that.
Didn't exist ten years ago ten years ago.
Yeah the iphone yeah okay well whatever.
Year you know that i won't even exist at.
One point yeah and how far it's gone is.
Like this is an amazing about 14 years i.
Think.
Yeah it's regardless even in the first.
Iphone compared to now it's amazing it's.
A great brilliant product and maybe they.
Needed all that all our money to make it.
To get it that far get it to that point.
Yeah maybe maybe maybe that's the only.
Way they're surviving but i highly.
Highly doubt that i think they're making.
So much money yeah i don't think that's.
The problem to create a company like.
That it's a a lot of work and it's it is.
Money to company you know like each.
Engineer you know they have like i don't.
Even how many staff they have probably.
Like hundreds of thousands i'm guessing.
Obably yeah like one engineer in for ar.
Yeah it cost like 300 grand a year.
Yeah right that's like not even.
Including like health insurance right so.
Let's say four hundred thousand a year.
Yeah for one person what if they but.
Think about it like this.
They're they have that many they have to.
Pay a lot obviously alright but it.
That's not the issue like they they're.
Making money they're making like they.
Make a ton of my guy at the top is made.
Oney the people at hilltop they all make.
A lot exactly like a ridiculous amount.
Yeah so it's not the issue that they're.
Like they need to do this to to stay.
Competitive like they're doing it.
Because it makes it makes.
And money yeah you know it's not about.
Like because they're not making money.
They're dying no they can be making.
Money but there's a difference between.
Making money and being greedy that's it.
That's another conversation there's some.
Philosophy in there a lot of philosophy.
In that one you know what else is greedy.
When you agreed he agreed with me oh oh.
Because the word greed let me bring it.
Back to the beginning point yes i said.
That because i do you knew we were gonna.
Be dejavu i'm starting to feel tingly of.
Greed holy crap asmr seat time in space.
I'm time in space all this whole podcast.
There's no order everything's happening.
At the same time did you have the very.
First iphone.
I don't think levi did i think i only.
Got like the second third i was on i.
Came in at before i think i was really.
Late i was a blackberry guy or awesome.
Dude you like the buttons you could text.
Without looking yeah i like those and.
You know else you could do is play that.
Little ball game where you bounce it off.
The walls and break all the things pong.
Pong no you break like the block brick.
Breaker yeah that see you don't even.
Know dude rick baker was you know kids.
Don't even know did you why does an.
Iphone have to it's like a simple game.
Yeah they probably do they're starting.
To get into the you know software so.
They're gonna have a bunch of guys.
Remember um the little block dude you.
Know your ti-83 spidey use your.
Calculators had that that block dude.
Game oh like and you would like have to.
Like solve puzzles you remember that i.
Don't remember that i never had a ti you.
Never had ti a tattoo or didn't get into.
Calculus so i think i don't need it for.
Account you need it for geometry i only.
Got up to algebra one that's a lie such.
A lie hey you know if there's people out.
There who've got only into algebra one.
It's okay.
It is okay einstein didn't even get to.
Anything he's a nobody he got somewhere.
He didn't even know what gravity was.
Loser.
That guy is who is that guy rest in.
Peace you know i know he dated his.
Cousin what i'm discussing really i.
Watch the documentary i think so yeah he.
Left his wife deformed his cousin or.
Something like that.
Yeah wait i heard it was his sister.
Okay well regardless it's still weird.
Hey but if you're dating your cousin.
It's okay guys yeah i've heard some.
Stories about people dating their.
Cousins there's some at what point you.
Know how like we're like it's okay that.
We're saying this yeah like well that's.
Weird.
At what point is pc culture gonna reach.
That you know i mean do you know i mean.
Cuz that's kind of the route you know.
What you know before you could be like.
Oh and not that i'm saying this but back.
In the day they power like try think of.
A good example like being gay was so.
Wrong and now if you were to say oh.
That's weird you would get so much flak.
For it yeah i mean but then i yeah so.
What if in the future it's like dude.
They love is love dude like if you want.
To love your sister and cousin like how.
Dare you say it's weird you know what at.
What point does it stop because it might.
Not it won't i don't think it will.
What you don't think about what i think.
It's okay i think it's okay if a guy.
Loves your sister i think so too.
I don't know except yeah i don't think.
It's acceptable it's not except on and.
There's also health reasons for that i.
Think if you have kids i don't like it.
There you know but there's also health.
Reasons for a lot of things i don't.
Think so either but i'm just saying it.
Might we don't know it nobody thought it.
Was gonna be at a time when everybody.
Was like you know what there shouldn't.
Be any laws against it if people want to.
Yeah but like at what point is it but.
How is that dangerous to society or in.
Menace i don't know i don't get the kid.
Maybe there's more complications i guess.
You don't think just because people want.
To do it there shouldn't be laws against.
It no with with it with your system.
Siblings siblings sibling love so in.
Assessed instances illegal yeah it is.
Right mm-hmm.
It's just it's not just like that's.
Weird and gross.
I don't it's legal should it be illegal.
Or i think it shouldn't be illegal as.
Long as you don't have kids because.
There's complications there if we're.
Getting into politics about it oh you.
Always fall takes me out yeah but do you.
Know what i'm saying though right like.
At what point the freedom does it stop.
If you want to if you want to marry your.
Cow you should be able to seed so that.
So there's our you miss there too but.
Like i think it's cute your.
You're late i get to that point where.
Who's to determine what love is.
No but i'm but that's what we're art.
That's what we're saying yeah so i'm i'm.
Saying it's okay okay so you're already.
At that point i'm already there yeah we.
Got legal paper so you think you're.
You're taking like a libertarian side.
Where the government should not regulate.
Personal right like love interest or.
Like laws know what love we're already.
We already have that but but the.
Argument there is that people when you.
Get married there's benefits oh you're.
Talking about the benefits part no but.
No but i that's what i'm saying that's.
Why you should or that's the argument.
For like why people don't want to allow.
Gay marriage or you know if gay if gay.
Transsexual lesbian whatever else yes.
I'm missing if any of those people can.
Benefit from from these laws because.
Because what defines that is love their.
Definition of love yeah right right.
So if love is what it is if i love my.
Dog but it's also consider them it's not.
Considered maybe not my dog if i have a.
Like brother or sister whatever right if.
That if that relationship is based off.
Of old quote unquote love right yeah but.
How same exact it's different with a dog.
Because a dog can't reciprocate okay so.
Your sister like incest yeah like yeah.
Your sister yeah that i get that.
Perspective i just haven't thought about.
That much i don't think about it either.
I don't want to know but i know what.
You're saying disgusts me to think about.
It i know but so we're allowed to see.
That right now if they see this in like.
20 years when it's allowed maybe what.
I'm saying yeah i mean we're gonna be.
We're bigots know so what i'm saying it.
Disgusts me personally yeah but other.
People that's what i'm saying but back.
Then 20 years ago it was disgusting.
People to be gay like i don't want to.
Kiss a dude i know you don't straight i.
Know you don't you guys to want to kiss.
A dude for myself.
Yeah and that's okay i don't judge if to.
The other guys wanna do it that's fine.
Your think what i'm saying you're not.
Even allowed to say that anymore so you.
What what i just said yeah i just said.
It.
No you're not about to just you're.
Disgusting like that's disgusting you're.
Not allowed to say that you were oh no.
What i don't even like it when two.
Couples we're allowed to kiss in front.
Of me i don't.
Like that right now i know sure well.
We're we're allowed to say right now.
Here what we're pushing down a slippery.
Slope no but i'm saying this is that's i.
It's interesting someone it is it is.
We're allowed right not to say oh my.
Gosh that guy and girl brother and.
Sister are in love and they're hooking.
Up that is weird i had that is.
Disgusting i think it's disgusting i.
Think it's fine to say that because i.
Feel that i know but i'm just saying why.
Myself doing that my soul but i'm just.
Saying we're allowed socially to say it.
Yeah yes we are we are you say like oh.
My gosh you saw the news like this this.
Mom was dating her 30-something your own.
Son okay that's disgusting i know but.
You can't you can say that yeah if you.
See two people who write no matter what.
You believe i yeah i think anyone should.
Be able to say anything they want yeah.
As long as it doesn't incite i know but.
I'm like paying a wiley point or you're.
Like you know i don't know i just.
He said no offence and he was talking.
About people who are in like who are in.
No no offense no that's what i'm saying.
It's my free speech yeah but as far as.
What other people do in their lives it's.
None of my business i agree with that.
There's a wall right there but i agree.
With between me and that same like like.
A sister something like you know like.
That's off limits right first like i'll.
Take it to the crazy extreme for for.
Human beings that have sexual relations.
With animals which does exist yeah like.
You know bestiality i don't watch that.
Stuff never even actually even seen one.
Sure but i know it exists right because.
People told me yeah and it's illegal who.
Am i to say though that like what that.
Person does and feels what if they.
Really feel in love like maybe there's.
Psychologically a little bit strange.
From my perspective but if they are.
Actually super in love sexually with a.
Monkey and the monkey maybe feels the.
Same way.
Honey that's the thing how do you how do.
You know that the monkey could that's.
Okay fine let's let's take you.
Brother-sister relationship yeah brother.
And sister sexuality and love and.
Romantic and i would never do that.
Let me put that out there and no offense.
No offense anyone like for voice no but.
It is offensive to them but it's in.
Society it's not offense okay because we.
All agree that it's disgusting right but.
There are until that there are people.
Who are okay with that there's very.
There's less and i'm sure they do exist.
But what i'm saying all this up is like.
What where do we draw the line because.
We used to draw the lines in different.
Places so right now this same podcast.
Video in let not even maybe like 20.
Years yeah that's not a lot of time.
We'll still be alive.
30 years even at what point does this pc.
Culture make it not okay to say what we.
Just said that we're gonna be a.
Considered yeah like just incest phobic.
We're bringing incest what you're an ss.
Phone it sounds like something that's.
Yeah like it's like yeah of course we.
Could say that now but you're saying in.
10 years because before they thought.
Being gay was wrong they did yeah they.
Thought it would like every majority of.
People thought it was wrong they felt.
That even gay people vote they had to.
Hide it yeah yeah so that's all i'm.
Saying is to like let's say 40 50 years.
Ago or same thing as being black they.
Thought it was wrong to have that skin.
Color to be asian or whatever at some.
Point yeah so as much as we believe.
Something right now that incest is.
Disgusting it is is a very part there's.
A possibility right yeah in in 20 30 40.
100 years i'm gonna get we're gonna i'm.
Gonna be in trouble for having said what.
I said or everyone in this generation.
Like wow they were so close-minded right.
Yeah exactly but that's what i'm saying.
That was it stop so i'm progressing i'm.
Like fast forwarding to 20 years later.
And saying right it's i know you do your.
Thing i know you are i don't want to.
Participate in it but you do your thing.
Yeah but not for the animals that's.
Different unless you can get animal.
Intelligence level i'm just taking that.
The animal thing that's different but.
I'm talking about human human.
Interaction yeah okay but here's the.
Other argument yeah what about a 17 year.
Old kid or like a 15 year old and an.
Adult or a 12 year old and an adult who.
Consents the government what if at some.
Point yeah it does but what if at some.
Point it becomes it becomes that where.
It's like okay well who decides how old.
You are when you can make choices.
Conscious choices man it could you never.
Know it could it could become that.
When you could didn't well you know.
Because we can say i think pedophiles.
Are disgusting i don't know what age.
Yeah you know because some people you.
Can consent when you're 17 years old.
That's the 18 right you have to be right.
To be allowed to get married or okay.
Well let's say 16 to get love or to be.
Macked you would know like you remember.
You as a kid maybe you only the smartest.
Thing but like you could also say that.
About your 20 year old self or your 30.
Year old self like maybe your 40 year.
Old self would be like my 30 year old.
Self should have never gotten married he.
Didn't know better.
Yeah should we make it illegal for him.
To get thirty year olds and under you.
Get married marriage is a different.
Thing from what i mean that's just my.
Best my want that you know what i'm.
Saying yeah yeah i think no but where do.
You where do you stand where do you guys.
Stand somewhere right i follow the law.
Yeah but like i think people pedophiles.
And some like that like i i think it's.
Right for it i don't think it i don't.
Think it's right to that someone up that.
Age gap so what is that age gap for you.
I mean it's whatever to me it's been.
Defined by what's the law what the last.
Legal yeah i agree i'm in the same boat.
Too right that's the only reason why.
Though yeah but if you really think.
About and break it down it's like it's.
Already weird if like say one one is 18.
Which is legal and the other one's 50 i.
Think that's weird i think it's like.
We're offending we could offend people.
Most people society agrees that's.
Probably weird but then you're also like.
A 8 age discrimination nist yeah because.
Back in the day i'm pretty sure like.
Back like you know yeah maybe like.
During genghis khan era or something.
Right mm-hmm.
Even further back i'm sure there were.
Marriages that looked like that yeah i.
Don't know if the word pedophilia really.
Do you think it existed i guess the.
Whole there the cultural thing maybe it.
Was more of it religiously there was a.
Set up right like you know what do you.
Call arranged marriages at certain point.
Maybe the parents thought okay my child.
Here my son or daughter is at the age.
That i believe who that that can be and.
Should be married well yeah i mean if.
You're talking about a long time ago you.
Probably would get married and start.
Being an adult as soon as it's like 13.
Yeah soon as you get your period when.
They're fertile pedophilia and stuff.
Like that it's probably i would assume.
More of a modern term that describes.
Like predators.
Right like modern society like the.
Predators who are into this thing behind.
Closed doors and they they try to right.
Right all right as a as opposed to.
Having like an arranged yeah which is.
Which was coming through culture a.
Little bit something like that sense so.
What i'm saying and the whole reason why.
I brought it up is like it's not crazy.
Yeah isn't it crazy to think and this.
Goes back to like facts right right like.
As we know for a fact right now that's.
Gross.
To me i mean i think so but we're doing.
It on camera and this will live forever.
We know that it's disgusting right now.
To people what oh yeah but like i'm just.
Saying isn't it crazy to think that one.
Day it might not be to be yes exactly.
That's what i that's what i think you.
Think it won't that is so crazy.
Most people i would say most people even.
People listening probably queer crazy.
But like it's true if you really think.
About it yeah that many years ago people.
Thought it was crazy that black people.
Are on the same level as everyone else.
Even asian that's true yeah same thing.
With especially gay people yeah it was.
Illegal and now it's legal yeah so go.
Back like a 100 i don't know hundred on.
My history but how many years and tell.
Them there's gonna be a black president.
This this slave ancestor is gonna be in.
Charge of all you guys mm-hmm i.
Guarantee nobody would believe that.
Nobody be like that's disgusting.
Yeah but what if what if in the future.
We're saying then that pedophile.
Disgusting you're sick you deserve to be.
Shot comes normal and then right yeah.
This is scary i see what you're saying.
Yeah it's crazy to think that that could.
Happen it's not impossible it's not it.
Cost nothing is impossible because it's.
Happened yeah it was started off with.
Gays like being okay like being you know.
Homophobia was a big deal it was like.
Wrong to be homophobic like it was it.
Wasn't and then it slowly we saw the.
Change grow yeah i don't know about you.
But for me and oh yeah yeah like you.
Could say the fa g you could say that.
Yeah because i even said in a video back.
Then and nobody blinked about it.
Actually when i even said that word it.
Doesn't bother junior high yeah like it.
Wasn't it bad it wasn't it wasn't i'd.
Even tie that with like me neither.
I just said because it was like this.
Person came and then i stopped saying.
Exactly yeah because we're finding the.
Rules yeah society right society yeah.
But like even even now like just seeing.
The progression of like i guess the most.
Recent one in our lifetime our.
Generation is the lgbt like thing but it.
Wasn't a beauty it was just gay and.
Lesbians yes and then after that and.
When that start movements aren't.
Happening then transgenders and that's.
Happening right now all right i think in.
I'm talking like law large face yes it's.
Becoming a very normal and modern thing.
And then there's people fighting back.
There's always gonna be people.
Especially because it doesn't go with.
Like if we would they believe that's why.
I'm saying so at what point does it.
Become not that trying so not time let.
Me just say i'm not tying this like i'm.
Not saying a pedophile is a gate like a.
Gay person yeah yeah yeah your types of.
Combinations of people and yeah that we.
Looked at as being wrong and disgusting.
Yeah and i just thought it was it was.
Just a weird thought that's why alcohol.
That's why for me when you asked me the.
Incest rule thing and i was like already.
Fast-forwarding twenty years later.
Having seen what happened in the past.
And saying yeah it should be legal yeah.
I know i know what you're saying yeah so.
I'm just putting that hat on and yeah.
Like but you know what actually not.
Think about it yeah the whole animal.
Thing bestiality yeah if you really.
Really know.
Remember digging ourselves a hole but.
I'm just gonna say it if you were.
Already really yeah it's fine that.
Rabbits do to hole yeah the rabbit hole.
Basically if you really if you really.
Break it down you can get to a point.
Where people who's to say it might not.
Get to a point where people are like.
Okay this guy can consent this animal.
Can't consent or can't consent but who's.
Who's to say that we don't get to a.
Point where you're like well that is.
Animalist you're being an animal like a.
Animal for that animal has the right how.
Do you know i can't make decisions how.
Do you know that animal doesn't are you.
Saying it's like a like you know like.
Being a feminist are you saying like oh.
This you're treating this animal is less.
Than you you think humans are that much.
Superior that animals can't make.
Decisions i feel like there's probably a.
Subculture that's already like that yeah.
Yeah but what i'm saying is we that's.
It's pretty ridiculous yeah.
But who knows it happened yeah that's.
The crazy thing and in my i mean i think.
It will i think you know what i mean the.
Way the way we're going i don't think it.
Will i think because i think it's.
There's gonna be this we're still riding.
This wave of like legalizing and being.
Accepting of everything but i think.
There's gonna be a corner culture that.
Be like its back to the rules of the old.
Days yeah and i think it's starting to.
Already happen cuz of trump no not no.
Not just because of trump i think that's.
A that's possible i think it's just.
Effect of what's happening cuz of obama.
I've been going to extreme exactly i.
Think i think that's what's with.
Extremeness.
You know with extremeness comes.
Extremeness right right there's balance.
And hopefully yeah it lands somewhere in.
The middle yeah there's always there's.
Always i mean everything in life is a.
Sine and cosine graph and you know like.
Even in the three of us i'm sure there's.
There would be things that you know just.
Even on this in this in this tiny room.
Like there are things that we would.
Disagree with and there would have to be.
That balance in the middle of what we.
All agree to yeah but if we bring in one.
More person that balance might that that.
Middle point might need to shift over to.
The left or right or whatever right so.
Else that's just that's the president.
Human condition that's the president.
President is the president.
That's the influential people of the.
World they shifted which way they want.
Yeah the majority so that's what apple.
Is in tech yep well that got really deep.
We started talking about bestiality i.
Agree definitely agree all right so that.
Was a nice that was a great while we.
Really went we went deep to some faraway.
Places on that one yeah but you know.
What that i know that's the kind of this.
Is what i want this blog has to be its.
Called off the pill we didn't none of us.
Took it's not planned it's not planned i.
Like it like this i know i know this.
Better to have things planned but i.
Don't like planning for one sure so too.
Bad and this is honestly stuff that we.
Probably would have talked about in the.
Kitchen we do one minutes later and you.
David sometimes yeah even though like.
It's gonna sound really weird but we'll.
Be on facetime working.
Like a song or something yeah and then.
We'll end up like looking at my phone.
It's like three hours later i was like.
What are we talked to we're not even.
Working on the song did we talk about.
It's usually really weird things it's.
The same thing we just talked about we.
Talked about incest all the diversity oh.
Just kidding just kidding guys this is.
Actually the first time we talked about.
This i think it is the first time yeah.
Other things we talked about that we.
Should probably bring up another time it.
Always starts with what do you think.
About bla bla bla bla bla bla or what do.
You think.
Bla bla bla bla and then it's like goes.
On forever that's called a td that's got.
Off the pill yeah that's a adhd moment.
Yeah anyway thank you guys for tuning in.
To another off the pill podcast we'll.
Talk to you on the next pot and you can.
Hear this podcast on all platforms all.
Platicas exist in there actually might.
Be more the next time you listen to this.
