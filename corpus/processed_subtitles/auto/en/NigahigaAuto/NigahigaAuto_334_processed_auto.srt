Hey guys so i know what you're thinking.
Why the long face bad jokes brian that's.
A bad way to start a video hey guys so.
Something a little fishy has been.
Happening on youtube lady and i just.
Wanted up i'm sorry could i please get.
Rid of this stupid joke who wrote this.
Anyway i didn't which is also you oh.
That our good one.
Anyway back to the youtube fishiness i.
Posted a video last week and usually.
After i post a video i gain about $5 an.
Hour more subscribers but over the past.
Week i lost about a hundred thousand.
Subscribers so i was like there you guys.
Really did not like that video but then.
I checked i saw the other youtubers like.
Smosh and shane dawson and.
Raywilliamjohnson and other on since.
We're losing subscribers as well every.
Day we're losing more and more and we.
Just keep falling deeper and deeper into.
This whole pad so she said run for once.
I finally make my first serious video.
And and you're treating this like it's.
Some big joke so why is this happening.
Youtube is once again deleting youtube.
Accounts so instead of deleting just.
Inactive account i've been getting a lot.
Of comments and tweets from people.
Saying that they've been automatically.
Unsubscribed to some of their favorite.
Channels that they go to every day have.
You ever thought that people just don't.
Want to subscribe to you guys anymore.
Well then that would be just one big.
Sudden coincidence and then we don't.
Believe in coincidences right dr. house.
I agree but on a real serious note i.
Appreciate every single one of my.
Subscribers but that's not the reason.
Why i started making videos i didn't do.
It to gain subscribers or to make money.
Or to gain popularity i did it because.
It was fun so just so you guys know i am.
Never gonna stop making videos even if i.
Lose all my subscribers i will never.
Back down i will never say never except.
For those past few times i will not stop.
Making videos good as nothing in this.
World it can stop.
And don't worry guys all the paper you.
Saw me using this videos is going to be.
Recited what you ruin this entire video.
You're boring man it takes two of you to.
Make one interesting person who mean.
You're like them you're like the mean.
Version of me you mean like me tv that.
Was a goodbye high-five for them all.
Right i have lots of friends.
