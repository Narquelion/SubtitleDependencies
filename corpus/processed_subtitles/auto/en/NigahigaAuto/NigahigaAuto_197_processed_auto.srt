Hey guys so i know for a lot of you the.
Title is probably a little confusing.
Because it's you know off the pill and.
Babies well it has nothing to do with.
Actually being off like a pregnancy pill.
This is a really unfortunate coincidence.
Off the pill has a series of brands i.
Used to do like a long time ago some of.
You guys might remember but i know that.
There's a lot of you who are a little.
Newer and probably don't know what this.
Is because i haven't done this in like i.
Don't know over five years so basically.
For those that don't know the off the.
Pill name came from the idea that those.
Were the days that i didn't take my adhd.
Medication and basically i would just.
Rant about any random thing that came to.
My mind although sometimes they're a.
Little too random where i would like go.
A little too off-topic or i would just.
Cut away to these random skits or jokes.
And usually it was just a really bad pun.
So bad to the point where i had to.
Explain it that's what he said see what.
I did there that's right it's gonna be.
Even better see what i did there.
That was smashing but yeah that's why i.
Like this series because i could just be.
Me speaking my mind not sure other.
People liked it as much as i did but.
Anyway the reason why i stopped doing.
This series in these types of videos and.
Stuck more with you know scripted skits.
And stuff was because well i i was a.
Huge coward because you know move.
Because like cows' words are like moo.
Select coward sorry because sometimes.
When i would do these videos and i was.
Just like freestyling i would say some.
Things that we're not too well thought.
Out i mean they were my honest opinions.
But sometimes well a lot of times.
They're very unpopular ones and honestly.
I just got scared of making them as you.
Know people got more and more.
Politically correct i just don't want to.
Offend anyone well not anymore bring.
Them back because i'm smarter now i'm.
Better now i've evolved okay i'm no.
Longer some little timid caterpie hiding.
In his little metapod i'm butterfree now.
Sorry guys i also used to make a lot of.
Pokemon references back then when it was.
A little more relevant but honestly i.
Don't think people really appreciated.
Them anyway as i was saying before i.
Went completely off-topic as usual i'm.
No longer afraid to do this series.
Anymore because i think i really have.
Gotten smarter you know i'm not gonna.
Say things that are just gonna offend.
People i know how to give an opinion now.
Being a little bit more pc and most of.
All i just know how to not.
The majority of the masses by giving a.
Controversial opinion on something that.
I really i hate babies okay there you.
Got it out of me okay obviously that's.
An exaggeration i don't hate babies that.
Much i know i know it's like what ryan's.
Baby hater okay you eat a baby you can't.
Believe your baby ain't looking you eat.
A baby there so either see where all of.
Our hands up like this when we talk well.
Just scare me out real quick and this.
Isn't quite what i wanted to talk about.
In this video but i just have to say.
This babies are stereotypically one of.
The most innocent things in the world.
Like if you were to make a list of the.
Most innocent things in the world it'd.
Probably be like babies and then like.
Puppies and trees puppies first babies.
Trees trees and because they're so.
Innocent it's really hard to be critical.
Of them but if you really break it down.
And you really think about it babies.
They they freaking suck figuratively and.
Literally like for one i'm not that very.
Old age right now where a bunch of my.
Friends and my classmates and peers.
Around my age are starting to have kids.
And they'll go on their social media and.
They'll post like these pictures of.
Their newborn babies like i'm talking.
Like right after their birth and right.
Like a caption like oh my gosh she's so.
Beautiful.
Oh he's changed my life for the better.
You such a cute baby uh i sound like an.
Ass right now but almost at the point.
Hear me help everybody in the comments.
Are like oh congrats she's so beautiful.
Omg she's so beautiful grats he's.
Adorable oh cute so cute so coyote and.
Yes i'm not saying the babies aren't.
Cute i think a lot of babies not all but.
I think a lot of babies are cute but you.
Guys i can't be the only one that thinks.
That newborn babies are a little gross.
Looking they're all red and wrinkly.
Beady eyes gunk all over them yep and.
Now you can see why i stopped making.
This series i mean this wasn't even the.
Point i want to talk about in this video.
Let's just get to that all right the.
Whole reason why i even started thinking.
About babies is because last week i came.
Across this video about this new.
Movement i don't know if you guys heard.
About it it's called babies babies.
Babies babies babies i don't know how.
They pronounce it sounds more like a.
Disease to me than a movement whoo he's.
Got the babies and basically if you.
Haven't heard about this movement early.
Parents are starting to raise their kids.
As these babies which basically means.
That they're raising their kids with no.
Gender so they're not a boy or a girl.
They just form a thick be baby i don't.
Know why they had to call it that it's.
Not like babies is a gendered word you.
Can still call them babies anyway so.
Basically these parents.
Raising these babies or babies i can as.
A gender-neutral so basically they're.
Not telling them they're a boy or a girl.
As they're growing up because they want.
The baby to decide on its own which.
Gender it wants to be 100% sir is this a.
Real thing you can look it up and you.
Guys know i don't normally speak out.
About you know more serious.
Controversial topics but that's the.
Thing when i first saw this video i.
Didn't think it was serious i literally.
Thought it was a joke and i'm sorry i.
Know this will offend a lot of people.
Especially the people who are already a.
Part of this this movement but i think.
It's ridiculous i'm all for the.
Transgender community and the gay.
Community and the lesbian lgbtq bar s.
Tuv god i don't know there's too many.
Letters now i'm all for people doing.
Whatever the hell they want to do as.
Long as it's not hurting other people to.
Be honest i think this one has gone a.
Step too far i think it is harming.
People it's harming the baby these.
Babies are gonna be so confused maybe.
Not when they're worth their parents but.
When they start to meet other babies and.
Those babies are like what do you mean.
You're not a he or a she min these.
Parents are almost guaranteeing that.
This kid is gonna get bullied when he.
Grows up she grows up they grow up.
That's why they called it babies and the.
Thing is i like to think i'm a very.
Open-minded person i'm always open to.
Hearing new ideas this is like come on.
You copy a little realistic here a baby.
Should not be able to make a decision as.
Important as that in fact a baby should.
Not be able to make any decisions at all.
On other than which toy to play with and.
Even then we read aside which toys the.
Baby can choose from these babies are.
Freaking idiot there's a reason why we.
Don't treat them like a dog because if.
We did i'm pretty sure that would be.
Considered abuse shut up.
We're wait did he just he's been down.
There for a while.
Yeah like four minutes now it's crazy.
Man wow and i know you can argue that.
These babies aren't actually making.
Decisions - they're a little bit older.
Like when they can talk whether that's.
Like age two or three i don't know when.
Babies start talking but i'm pretty sure.
At that age they can still answer the.
Question are you a boy or a girl yes or.
No or they can say boy or girl by that.
And that's still way too young to be.
Deciding anything i mean even if there.
Were four years old or five i mean have.
You ever talked to a five year old.
Before they're still really really dumb.
Hey good to see you again you do i see.
You brought a little timmy here with you.
I did say hi like he's so shy at times.
That once you get him going.
What'd you do today timmy well my mom.
Took me to the park and we went on the.
Swings yeah do we then i swing on the.
Swings and i swing did oh.
The swings it sounds like so much fun.
And then i then i swing did 2 4 4 2.
Whole times wow.
Two whole times this is awesome and then.
After there were there was a green ball.
And and the ball came by me and i could.
Kick the ball i kicked it and then it.
Was rolling on it and on the grass which.
Was green like the ball was green with.
The grass and green ball was green and.
It was green and it was green and then.
He was greens to the ball green you.
Idiot okay obviously i'm going a little.
Over the top but you guys get the point.
Any rational person knows that little.
Kids let alone babies aren't developed.
Enough to make these kind of.
Life-changing decision.
I mean if this movement is really about.
The kids and about these babies and.
Giving them the power to choose why stop.
At gender what's next why not let kids.
Choose their own name why did you get to.
Choose it up normal they want they just.
Ask the kid when they first start.
Talking what's your name why can't the.
Kid be named mama or dada or google or.
Gaga i guess it could be gaga.
Maybe that's why eighty gaga is a baby.
Now we know yes that does make you more.
Success and that's just the beginning.
Why do you get to dress your kid up when.
You go out in public what if he wants to.
Run around naked you don't know or why.
Do you get to choose with the baby eat.
Shouldn't you just take it to the market.
And let it point at what it wants why do.
You put diapers on them why do you.
Potty-trained there why do you get to.
Decide where the baby can and can't go.
Approve that that is butter all.
Oppression because big bundles and.
Babies should be able to express their.
Buttholes wherever they go under where.
Am i going with this this slide mean my.
Meds.
By the way you better not be picking up.
Carrying or touching your baby in any.
Way before it can speak because if it.
Can't speak it can't consent if it can.
Consent that's assault and also the baby.
Did not consent to be born so you.
Basically kicked it out of its home you.
Did that okay this is ridiculous that is.
My point you don't need a baby's consent.
No give babies those choices because we.
Know what's best for them because babies.
And little kids are just useless loud.
Disease-carrying moochers that depend on.
Adults to take care of them and make.
Decisions for them because you're just.
Too stupid and then just physically.
Pathetic to be able to survive on their.
Own.
Wow what is wrong with me i really do.
Hate kids you guys get the point you can.
Probably see why i enjoy this series and.
Why a lot of people get a little mad so.
I'm sorry to other people within i.
Probably offended.
Obviously i'm half joking when i say.
That i hate kids i don't actually hate.
Kids my points remain the same and don't.
Get me wrong i do love kids in fact i.
Want to have a kid one day i just don't.
Want to have a baby who knows you know.
Maybe all it takes is for me to just.
Mature a little and for me to experience.
It myself.
Maybe there's something i'm missing.
Because i'm not there to experience it.
Myself maybe if i had a baby of my own.
And i'd be so in love with it and.
Blinded by the potential of what could.
Be that i'd love every aspect of it even.
The negative even as a newborn maybe if.
It's my own kid i won't see the newborn.
House like this dirty red gross looking.
Squishy thing and i'll see the true.
Beauty the potential of what could be.
That the actual miracle of life yeah no.
That's that's still gross that is come.
On that is this girl's right i think.
Definitely as davies.
