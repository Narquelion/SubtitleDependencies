Lot of people who many have already fell.

Rolled people last year to remember.
Isn't the number one rule surprise to.
Not repeat the same rules since when are.
There rules and like i already said it's.
April fool's it's not gonna work oh what.
Do you guys really think i haven't.
Thought of that i have a lead on how to.
Find the next rick rule full thought-out.
Plan but i'm still gonna need your guys.
Commitments what i'm just trying to help.
I feel like i don't contribute to any of.
These thinking you're right back on the.
Same page sean let's get this started of.
Course he's gonna side with you again.
You guys know that in rick astley's song.
Never gonna give you up he says the word.
Never quite frequently wouldn't it be.
Crazy if i told you that there's a song.
That says the word never even more than.
That even though the song is about never.
Saying never get this in rick astley.
Song he says the word 41 times exactly.
Including the title in justin bieber's.
Song he says the word 69 times including.
The title from a guy who's saying never.
To say never isn't it a little weird.
That he's saying the word never.
Twenty-eight more times than rick anyone.
Starting to see the obvious sign here.
Other than the two of them saying the.
Word never a lot no there's no.
Connection guys it's so obvious.
Seriously you two sean i still don't get.
It.
Justin is 20 years old why don't take a.
Guess how old rick astley is tell us.
Already you are no fun he's 48 how much.
Do you think the difference between the.
Two ages are i'm just gonna take a wild.
Guess and say 28 the exact difference of.
The number of times they say never in.
Each of their songs seal in the.
Connection yet gotta admit that's a good.
One making one connection or coincidence.
I should say doesn't mean anything you.
Sure about that understand this.
Never say never was not just justin's.
Biggest song but his biggest movie.
Couldn't be his only movie if he keeps.
Getting arrested i'm on break he's a kid.
Who said it yourself he's 20 years old.
He's all grown up never mind i was just.
