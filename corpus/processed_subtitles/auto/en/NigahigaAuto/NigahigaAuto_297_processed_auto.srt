Stomach kind of hurts no that's all the.
More reason you should have some.
Lemonade it's good for your stomach.
Really so as you guys know our past.
Investigations have gone very.
Successfully as you know figure out the.
Truth behind miley cyrus and of course.
Proving the illuminati is real but now.
We've been asked to investigate another.
Mystery mystery of beyonce's lemonade.
Album how is that even a mystery it's.
Just her oh but this album is completely.
Different see nobody knows what this.
Album is about there's a lot of.
Different theory some people believe.
That this album is about infidelity and.
How jay-z cheated on beyonce but at the.
Same time some other people say well if.
You really did cheat on her why are they.
Still together and more importantly why.
Did she release her songs and title the.
Platform that jay-z himself owned and.
Why is it even called lemonades there's.
No explanation for that some people.
Believe that okay we get it there's a.
Bunch of conspiracy theories but this.
Better not be one of those illuminati.
Thing no in fact it's a complete.
Opposite you see last time we talked.
About the illuminati we started with.
Apples because apples are by far the.
Most popular fruit they're eaten by.
Children and adults are used in schools.
To represent our teachers all of our.
Technology comes from apple even the.
Bible speaks about apples in the story.
Of adam and eve all of a sudden in less.
Than a month nobody's talking about this.
Powerful fruit because there's another.
Fruit on the rise the rival to the app.
With a complete opposite oranges like.
Apples and oranges.
No what about bananas like more bananas.
Than anything see that's what i thought.
At first oranges and bananas are way.
More popular than lemon so why did.
Beyonce choose lemons over all the other.
Fruits mixed to the letters c orange.
Banana six-letter words they don't fit.
Apple and lemon both fives but there's.
An even bigger hint that beyond sea.
Lettuce that proves that there's more to.
This album than we all thought what she.
Named it lemonade not lemon so what.
That's just juice see but it is it what.
You see every other fruit can be made.
Into a juice but not lemons apples.
Become apple juice oranges become orange.
Juice pineapple pineapple juice kiwi.
Juice even tomato juice but not lemons.
Lemons become lemonade strange.
Chum that is stream okay fine let's say.
You're right and there's something more.
To it now what we start with the most.
Famous saying about lemonade when life.
Gives you lemons you make lemonade.
That's not the case here is it because.
We're being given lemonade not lemons so.
So beyonce wants us to work backwards.
See beyonce has crazy following most of.
Them girls and they're so in love with.
Her they want to dedicate their lives to.
Being her followers they're so in love.
With her they literally say things like.
Amaya beyonce is life and in this.
Scenario that's absolutely correct see.
If we work backwards when life gives you.
Lemons you make lemonade.
But if beyonce is lie it should be when.
Beyonce gives you lemonade you may.
Lemons exactly but that doesn't make any.
Sense oh it doesn't not yet one of the.
First things that come to mind when you.
Say the word lemon sour i don't know.
Yellow right sour yo and if we continue.
To work backwards the phrase we make.
Lemons becomes lemons make you what the.
Lemons make you do when you bite into.
Him squint because it's sour exactly and.
When you squint you look more like an.
Asian what dude that's racist.
And you squint you look more like.
You're tired because your eyes are.
Smaller like an asian yeah of course and.
Asians are stereotypically known to be.
Yellow just like lemon again we continue.
To work backwards yellow backwards is.
Wally wally like the disney movie about.
The earth coming to an end.
See in that movie we think that wall is.
The only remaining individual on earth.
But there's another and coincidentally.
Her name is eve just like adam and eve.
Who supposedly were the only two.
Individuals on earth as well and since.
Eve is obviously eve then adam must be.
Wall-e.
And since wall-e is actually wall-e.
Yellow backwards what they're really.
Saying is that adam is yellow yellow.
Adam yellow adam in chemistry you.
Learned that cpk coloring is used to.
Distinguish atoms by color and the color.
Yellow is assigned to sulfur and sulfur.
Is an atomic number of 16 and it also.
Smells like rotten egg however if you.
Smell rotten eggs and you're not near a.
Volcano chances are is just somebody's.
Rotten egg farm and since eggs are.
Measured in dozens coincidentally the.
Same number of songs and beyonce's album.
If we take the atomic number of 16 and.
Count out all the songs we come all the.
Way back to the first song with the.
Remainder of four track four happens to.
Be the song named sorry but who else.
Just recently had the biggest hit in the.
World name sorry justin bieber who if.
You didn't know recently just dyed his.
Hair guess what color that's right yeah.
But recently only a week after beyonce.
Releases her lemonade album justin.
Bieber shaye's off his yellow hair he.
Goes right back to his natural hair.
Color which is still kind of a off.
Yellow color which is awfully symbolic.
And similar to peeling 11 as you peel.
Off the yellow outside and the inside is.
An off yellow color which means the pugh.
Is nothing more than a cover speaking of.
Covers when we see the album cover of.
Lemonade instantly you see the shape of.
The lemon but there is a lot more to it.
We work from the bottom up we see fern.
If i had to guess what i don't want that.
Look like i would have to say it looks.
Like a bear and above that you see an.
Ear which is strange because if she were.
A part of the illuminati that'd be the.
Perfect place to put an eye but no this.
Is something new she put him here and on.
Her ear rings eerie and as we mentioned.
Before above that the lemon what don't.
You get it.
No bears rings lemons beyonce is bearing.
Fruit and bearing fruit for a tree means.
That it's growing fruits for a person.
Bearing fruit means that she's growing.
Something else if you peel off the cover.
What she's really trying to say yonsei.
Is pregnant see that's what lemonade.
It's really about this has got to be one.
Of the dumbest ones you've had so far.
There's so many holes in this well i.
Didn't say i was done yet there's more.
Yeah i told you guys i needed your help.
I still haven't figured out what these.
Are yeah you really think beyonce's.
Pregnant i don't see how feminie could.
Be about anything else well if she.
Really is i don't think she should be.
Drinking lemonade look how many carbs.
There are 53 grams for one bottle that's.
Crazy.
Didn't eat three grams for three crab oh.
My god.
It's numbers what.
53 grams you said you said there 53 in.
There yeah 52 grams 83 grams 53 grammys.
Huh beyonce has the record for the most.
Grammy nominations 53 of them way there.
You go again connecting two completely.
Unrelated things it's 53 grams of.
Carbohydrates not granny exactly that's.
Was leading us to the next part if we.
Break it up it's just car bull hydrate.
When you hear car bowl a bowl the size.
Of a car that's a really big bowl.
Hydrate has to do with liquids but if.
We're talking about a bowl what kind of.
Liquids do you put in a bowl lemonade.
But no it's soup oh now you have a.
Really big bowl of soup no a huge bowl.
Of soup a super bowl the super bowl.
Beyonce was a halftime show performer.
For to love him super bowl xlvii and 50.
But she wasn't even really a made.
Performer in super bowl 50 she was just.
In it there's kind of a big difference.
Oh there's a difference alright but.
Ain't that big what the difference.
Between super bowl 50 and 47 is 3 and 3.
Is our magic number one might say how so.
Beyond just 34 jay z's 46 when we add.
Their ages together we have 80 okay we.
Take our magic number three and subtract.
Bottom 80 we're left with 77 and 77 as.
We all know is the product of 7 times 11.
7-eleven 7-eleven the hit song that.
Beyonce released three years ago but if.
She planned this three years ago why now.
He's on the anniversary of seven lemons.
Released this year beyonce be 35 in 77.
Minus 35 at 42 the exact age jay-z was.
When his daughter blue ivy was born 42.
What what does their daughter even have.
Anything to do with 7-eleven was made.
For their daughter come on if you really.
Listen to the lyrics wave your hands.
Side to side clap clap clap clap it my.
Hands up my hands up i stand up with my.
Hands up it does sound like a children's.
Song exactly because 7-eleven was.
Disguised to be for us but really it was.
Just for their daughter that's why the.
Lyrics are so bad of course since this.
Song is made for their daughter don't.
Tell me it's a coincidence at their.
Daughters 4 years old yet in seven years.
She's going to be what.
It isn't eleven the exact number of.
Songs that's on her album no you said it.
Yourself there's twelve songs precisely.
See there's twelve songs but we got.
Eleven we were almost there we were this.
Close we were an inch away six inches to.
Be exact.
The only number in any of her titles and.
It's six the number six on her sixth.
Album six is our special number one.
Might say but i thought you said three.
Was our special number but no three is.
Our magic number because it's half of.
Six you see if we take it from where we.
Left off at eleven and we multiply it by.
Our special number of six we end up with.
Our final number 66 fifty-three 342 11.
66 but but what do they mean i don't.
Know but it has to mean something if not.
Beyonce when animated that obvious.
Obvious nothing about any of this is.
Zombie what are you talking about it was.
So clear literally forcing these.
Connections they make no sense at all it.
Makes it what's even worse is you ended.
Up with nothing nothing what we have the.
Last piece those are the last five.
Number five hours i mean nothing.
Oh my god seriously it's a bad one sorry.
I told you i wasn't feeling well dude.
What the heck did you eat it smells like.
Rotten egg that's him huh rotten eggs.
Sulfur they're elements although.
Fifty-three 342 1166 the atomic numbers.
Three is lithium iodide lithium.
Molybdenum sodium dysprosium it's a.
Formula it all makes sense now.
What does everything why beyonce made an.
Entire album bashing her husband a man.
Why the majority of beyonce's songs are.
All about and for women even why there's.
An ear on the album cover instead of an.
Eye yonsei his giving.
But to an idea no i group no one army.
Women to take over the world.
What it's all starting is that formula.
Shawn check that lemonade bottle head.
Dine the film but minneapolis it's all.
Here see the see it's already begun but.
We've been drinking this lemonade.
Exactly look at us we're fine yeah for.
Now who knows what's gonna happen later.
Look this is so stupid how do you even.
Come up with these ridiculous conspiracy.
Theories i really have to spell this out.
For you look at the abbreviations see.
This is not about the illuminati the.
Illuminati's around by men see beyonce.
Starting something new she's giving.
Birth to a new group of powerful women.
To not just take over the world the.
Previous illuminati as well think about.
It think about everything you've ever.
Heard from beyonce she wants who to run.
The world girls she wants although what.
Single ladies every single lady to rise.
Up in formation to go to flawless.
Irreplaceable army of grown women to.
Create the new illuminati the lady.
The 1180s i have that or she's just.
Pregnant look 10 minutes later we're all.
Drinking lemonade and we're still fine.
But are we though oh wait how come my.
Name change oh that's right it wasn't a.
Cup i peed in a bottle.
