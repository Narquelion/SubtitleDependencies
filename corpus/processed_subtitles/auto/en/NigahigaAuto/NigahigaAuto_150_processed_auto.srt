We're just gonna.
Can we just keep this moving because uh.
There's gonna be a lot of stuff that we.
Have to get through and i.
Really don't want it to drag the one.
Thing shane's actually really good at is.
Keeping his videos.
Nice and short so okay.
All right i'm psyched.
Because i'm a psychologist so.
Good um okay so it is uh.
Day two and don't don't let the fact.
That we're wearing the same clothes as.
Yesterday throw you off uh which is a.
Little stink.
Um we are currently heading over to.
Ryan's house.
Um but since we have a little bit of a.
Drive uh what we're gonna do is call one.
Of his closest friends.
And kind of do an interview i guess kind.
Of you know what shane does and then um.
Just to get a better idea of you know.
What we're really dealing with here.
So and okay here we go it is ready.
Okay hello.
Hey is this uh is this regina speaking.
I am her well first off thank you so.
Much for.
Taking the time to talk with us what i.
Was just saying uh thank you so much for.
Taking the time to do this with us.
What are you talking about i didn't take.
Anything nope we're just saying thank.
You for taking the time.
Who the hell is that guy i don't want to.
Talk to you tell me the other way.
There we go much better sick now what.
Were you saying.
Uh well we're just calling because um we.
Know that you're really close to ryan.
Higa and we wanted to know.
A little bit about him so you are close.
To him is that correct.
Uh no that's not it it's not correct so.
You you're not close in uh no he lives.
All the way at his house i don't live in.
His house i can form my own house what.
Are you trying to say you stack that.
What i'm saying is you i mean you do.
Know things about him though right.
Duh like things that no one else knows i.
Know lots of things about him that.
Nobody knows but they're all secrets.
They're secrets are there any.
Anything that you can tell us that.
Nobody knows then yeah.
All his secrets okay.
Like what exactly um let me think a.
Little bit oh.
I know i got a good one go ahead so this.
One time we were all in a.
Shoot and ryan was sitting in this chair.
And i was right behind him because i was.
Counting on the gross white hairs he was.
Starting to get.
And nobody knows this but then he put up.
His phone and i could totally see his.
Phone screen and i saw that when he.
Actually opened his phone his passcode.
Is actually 169 no no regina we can't.
That's not the kind of secrets we're.
Looking for we can't share that in our.
Documentary why not nobody knows it it's.
A good one i'm sure it is a great secret.
But maybe something a little less.
Private than that oh.
Okay well nobody knows this one but.
Ever since ryan moved to his new house.
Everything.
Changed everything what do you mean by.
That exactly.
Well there's just so many different.
Things like.
His furniture and the paintings on the.
Wall.
And i can tell you right now that the.
Carpets are completely different from.
The enterprise i'll tell you that.
Those are things people already know but.
Just by watching his videos i know you.
Said less private yeah okay but maybe.
Something a little more private than.
That then.
Fine i didn't want to talk about this.
One but when he moved something else.
Changed as well.
Okay and i know for a fact that nobody.
Knows about this except for his closest.
Friends but.
When he moved he also got a new address.
And that address oh okay you know what.
Just forget it all right.
What we can use any of that what do you.
Want me to say those are the biggest.
Juiciest secrets i have about him what.
Do you want me talking about the boring.
Ones like the fact that he's only five.
Eight even though he claims he's five.
Nine or.
That he got a piano in his house even.
Though he doesn't know how to play it or.
How about the fact that he.
Has a big drinking problem and nobody.
Really knows about it except for his.
Closest friend.
Wait wait hold on back up what do you.
Want me to do back up hold on.
You just said ryan has a big drinking.
Problem uh yeah why.
Oh sure are you that that's completely.
True yeah cause that's a really big.
Accusation to make so we gotta make sure.
You get out of my face i wanna see you.
Again turn it up either way.
Getting back to what you were talking.
About you were saying he actually does.
Have a very big drinking problem yes.
How many times do i have to tell you.
Guys it's a big drinking problem okay.
I've seen it with my own eyes and ears.
That's very bad why else do you think he.
Has all those wet spots on his shirt and.
Why.
I don't like to wear socks to his house.
Anymore because every time i go there.
There's little puddles all over the.
Place and i like to step in it and it.
Gets all wet and my socks get whispered.
Wait what does that have to do with his.
Drinking problem because he's always.
Spilling what are you stupid.
Like i don't know what his problem is.
But it's not that hard to drink things.
I've been doing this since i was like.
Five years old so that's.
What you meant when you said he has a.
Big drinking problem that he spills a.
Little.
Oh my god yes how many times i gotta.
Tell you that the same thing i don't.
Want to talk to you anymore you're gonna.
Make me repair myself.
Wow um right.
I cannot believe we.
Have so much good stuff already dude.
This documentary 100 went viral.
We might we might even be on drama alert.
This one right here yeah i think this is.
Good yeah this is good.
All right thank you i'm pretty sure this.
Is the right.
Spot um oh you know what actually.
One more thing before we actually get in.
There i told him i was only bringing my.
Film crew.
So do not let him know what you actually.
Do because we don't want it to become.
Defensive.
Right okay right yeah so if he asked.
Just tell me like.
You're my assistant or make something up.
Whatever you do just do not let him know.
That you're actually a colonial psycho.
Psycho psychiatrist.
Clinical psychologist.
Hey guys hey ryan um good to finally.
Meet you in person good to meet you as.
Well man.
Oh and this is my good friend matt he is.
A clinical psycho.
It's like patient um.
Okay um cool well do you guys wanna.
Head in there and get this thing started.
You know what we'll meet you in there.
Because we're actually gonna go move the.
Car real quick because we parked in the.
Sun.
Right and uh it's we don't know how long.
This interview's gonna take and you know.
We don't want the ride home to be all.
Hot you know so.

Music.
Sir what are you doing oh my god oh my.
God oh my god look at this.
Look what i literally just got chills.
What are you talking about chills don't.
Have goosebumps or anything to indicate.
You have.
Okay you know what you can't see a.
Feeling but did you see what i just felt.
Just now when i saw what i felt.
What does that even mean i think we're.
Dealing with something.
A lot worse than what we thought okay we.
Literally just met him and he seems.
Completely normal to me okay you don't.
Think it's weird that he just.
Snuck up on us almost as if he was.
Planning for us to be right in this spot.
No we told him we were going to be heard.
A specific time and we did just that so.
No it's completely okay what about the.
Aggressive behavior the way he just.
Shoved his hand out at us show like oh.
I'm the dominant he shook.
Your hand he shook your hand that's.
Completely normal getting chose again.
Just thinking about his face did you not.
See the way he smiles like a psychotic.
Person his mouth gets all whiter his.
Eyes are squinty and no no just stop.
Okay.
I know you want this documentary to be.
All entertaining and dramatic but.
You can't fake it okay you can't all.
That's happened so far is we've shown up.
At a specific time which we gave him.
We met him you shook his hand and that's.
It by the way if you think his face is.
Suspicious that means your face is.
Suspicious because guess what you've got.
The same face.
Same face.
Wow that is.
The most racist thing i've heard all.
Week.
What i i'm very disappointed okay that's.
Not how i meant it in any way seriously.
Man.
It's 2019. grow up.
No it's not.
So i was thinking we could do the.
Interview here if that's good for you.
Guys yeah.
That's um that looks great i think we.
Well there's.
We should take this college because can.
I get you guys something to drink water.
Red bull.
Yeah i'll have a water please thank you.
Sure rain i'll take a v8 splash.
I don't think i have that oh okay then.
I'm i'm good thanks.
Okay what kind of person doesn't have.
The splash in their fridge.
The normal kind well i think it's pretty.
Normal to have v8 splash like pretty.
Stocked up.
Nobody drinks fade splash literally.
Nobody well maybe they would.
You know if this was like they wanted to.
Be like a sponsor for this documentary.
You know what i'm saying.
Are you trying to wink trying to get a.
Sponsor.
Thank you all right so um how do we.
Start this off do you want me to.
Introduce myself or don't even think of.
It like that this is just gonna be a.
Very.
Casual normal conversation just between.
Friends.
Think of it like uh just hanging out.
Okay cool um.
So first off i guess uh is there any.
History of mental illness in your family.
I'm sorry mentally illness like any.
Crazies in the family like i don't know.
Your parents you brother sister cousins.
You i don't know not that i'm aware of.
No.
No huh how interesting what's that.
Supposed to mean.
I'm sorry um ryan would you mind giving.
Me a moment with rain please.
Sure why.
What are you doing what who starts off a.
Conversation asking about mental illness.
How would you have started it then i.
Don't know talk about the weather talk.
Right.
Who cares about the weather okay i.
Thought we were here to find out if he.
Was one of those like crazy stuff.
Social sociopaths.
Okay and i'm not gonna be able to.
Evaluate him if he's uncomfortable and.
He doesn't open up to us do you.
Understand that.
So you got a pretty nice house.
Thanks man fine yes he does seem a.
Little uncomfortable yeah i think so so.
You know maybe just chill out with the.
Questions a little bit you're right fine.
You're right.
You're right i will i will chill at the.
Very least bring it up a little bit more.
Casually fine okay i will if it comes up.
I'm gonna run with it though.
Okay that's it that's exactly it and i.
Got it okay okay we're good.
Okay here yes.
Let's just come on let's just do this so.
Sorry about that.
Oh no problem uh you guys good we're.
Good.
We are good um speaking of good though.
The weather has been quite good what.
Didn't you guys say.
I mean for me personally it's been a.
Little cold but i guess if you're into.
40 degree temperatures yeah it's been.
Kind of nice.
That's funny uh speaking of cold.
Though have you guys ever been to the.
Grocery store now that place is freezing.
Let me tell you.
God i mean it definitely can be.
Sometimes such a weird.
Place the grocery store don't you think.
Like why do they still have a magazine.
Aisle right.
What is this 2015 do people really need.
Magazines.
Like let alone a new issue every single.
Month right.
What are you doing like what do they do.
With the old issues when the new ones.
Come out.
What are they doing i'm sorry is this.
Like some kind of comedy bit you're.
Working on no no just.
Casual conversation you know i just you.
Guys never wondered what happens to the.
Old issues when the new ones come off.
No i i can't say that i have i imagine.
They recycle them.
Oh well um i guess since we are on the.
Topic of both.
Old and new issues what are yours.
Exactly.
What okay seriously you need to stop.
What it came up naturally this time okay.
I don't even know if the rest of this.
Interview is even salvageable at this.
Point but if you want to grab anything.
Else at all you let me do the rest of.
The talking.
Understand fine fine but all i'm trying.
To do.
Is warn you okay he he really knows how.
To steer.
A conversation it's like.
That gas stove or is that electric um.
I'm pretty sure it's gas yeah he is.
Incredibly.
Manipulative and when i look into his.
Eyes i see.
This darkness you know the part that's.
Supposed to be colored in the middle.
There's this little circle of darkness.
That's just his eyes that's how eyes are.
Shaved and colorized yeah i think he's.
One of those things.
What things i think he's anemic that's.
Really.
That it is exactly what it is see he.
Already got tired.
I think that's what happened.
Let me do i have to go pee too.
Number one you're in the bathroom.
So okay i'm sorry.
Hey are you gonna wait for me.
You're gonna okay i'll be number one.
That's it.
Sorry about that again yeah we had some.
Camera issues to work out and.
You know it was just getting really.
Messed up look guys.
I know what's going on okay you guys.
Don't have to be so sneaky about it like.
I will be completely honest and answer.
All your questions.
As long as you guys do the same for me.
Because if not why are we doing this.
Right.
There's no point that sounds fair to me.
Totally um but we were.
Being honest there really was a problem.
With the cameras that we had to fix.
Right well this like weird error message.
Popped up on the uh.
Viewfinder screen on the camera saying.
That the lens aperture lens aperture was.
Corrupted by the shutter speed exposure.
On the memory card white balance iso.
Okay that's not even remotely true there.
Were no camera issues no it really said.
That the lens.
Aperture lens aperture well then why did.
It pop up on the screen.
I oh my god look i am so sorry okay you.
Know what guys let's just.
I think we should stop while we're ahead.
Okay if you want us to leave i.
Completely understand i think we should.
Go.
You know what no no hold on hold on i'm.
Actually really curious now um.
Rain could ask you a question.
Okay um why are you here.
What why i mean do this documentary.
No no rain why are you really here.
Why am i i just told you to do the.
Document to interview.
Rain documentary why are you here like.
Why am i.
What do you mean like why am i like.
Physically right here or like why.
Am i doing this documentary in the first.
Place.
Um you know i don't normally mean i i'm.
Not why.
What do you do i don't what what just.
Tell me why you're here this is.
Um just tell me why you're here i you.
Know the shame.
Stuff really seemed to brings you here.
Um are you hearing i'm only here.
Because i feel broken okay is that what.
You want to hear me say.
Fine i'm saying it i feel broken.
I'm broken i mean i mean i've been doing.
This for over 12 years you know it's a.
Long time.
It really is um.
And i know i don't normally you know.
Jump on trends and just do.
Things because it works um but.
You know i'm just so i'm just so tired.
You know.
So tired you're tired.
And so you compromised your own values.
And basically made a subpar documentary.
Piggybacking off the success of shane.
Dawson's series just.
Because you thought it would be easy.
Views but documentaries only succeed.
When people know they're real.
And now you're realizing that you.
Haven't been real.
For a very long time have you i.
I don't know i mean i i don't know um.
But you do.
Because you're finally looking at.
Yourself and seeing the real you.
The you that was hiding behind all the.
Other personas you've created over the.
Years to hide behind personas like.
What are you even i don't know what.
You're talking about i think maybe.
We should take a little break right now.
This is a good spot see there's the.
Happy funny version of you that uses.
Comedy as a defense mechanism to show.
That nothing really affects you.
Then there's the most normal persona the.
One that you use to show that everything.
Is just fine in your life despite.
Everything going on in your head.
There's the silly obnoxious one one that.
Thinks they're smarter than everyone.
Oblivious.
To the fact that everyone sees right.
Through them and how incredibly dumb.
They really are and there's just so many.
Others that people don't really see or.
Know about but you've created.
All of them for the exact same purpose.
To hide and protect the real one.
The broken one the one that nobody.
Really knows or gets to see.
Including you because in order to see.
Him.
You have to really look at yourself and.
You were always just so.
Afraid to do that now weren't you rain.
Or should i say.
Ryan.
This whole time okay you know all you've.
Done is change your hair that's.
Literally all you've done is put your.
Bangs down over your forehead.
Nothing's changed you know what i'm ryan.
I'm i'm finished.
This was supposed to be a documentary.
Okay not some sort of ridiculous drama.
It's not a drama.
Really oh it's not a drama well whatever.
It is it doesn't make any sense at all i.
Mean who are you right now.
Are you rain are you ryan and if so are.
You still ryan yeah that makes zero.
Sense.
That makes no sense you said you wanted.
To see inside the mind of ryan higo.
Nobody said that place made any sense.
What no i didn't want to do any of this.
This is all stupid okay this was his.
Idea reigns or writing whatever the.
Point is it wasn't my idea i wanted no.
Part of this and who do you think you.

Exactly what yeah who do you think you.
Are.
You know what this is stupid i'm done.
Stop cut cameras i'm done with this okay.
I'm done with this nonsense we're doing.
Not doing this anymore.
I'm gone and i already tell you that.
You're inside the mind of ryan higa.
Nonsense is sense he he.
Okay that makes no sense and he told me.
That don't you get it yet matt.
We're all ryan me reign regina.
The uber driver the cameraman the sound.
Guy makes you think you're so special.
What makes you think you're not ryan as.
Well because it's obvious you guys look.
The same.
I don't that would be the second most.
Racist thing i've heard all week if it.
Wasn't coming from myself.
Oh sometimes personas look different but.
Like i said they're all created for the.
Same purpose okay.
Okay well tell me uh if i'm a persona.
Ryan and you've named every person of.
Ryan that exists.
Tell me which persona am i why don't you.
Take a look right there.
And find out for yourself oh my god.
