Yeah i could see that.
Sorry i'm late.
What took you so long my same odd.
Morning routine you know her morning.
Routine it's almost night well i didn't.
Say it was a fast routine there's a lot.
Of stuff for us girls to do in the.
Morning don't you watch any of those.
Makeup girls to do all those my morning.
Routine videos and they basically just.
Show everybody what they do in the.
Morning um no why would anybody even.
Want to watch that cuz it's good hmm.
Anyway i think that's what we should do.
Today - what our morning routine so that.
People can appreciate how much work it.
Is for us girls to look the way we do.
All right if we're really gonna do this.
Who wants to go first or dizzle regina.
You want me to go you go first.
I don't even worth of you what about me.
You're not starting with you hana t i.
Don't even know if we're gonna even do.
Yours this time what why not cuz i know.
You're gonna troll us so you remember.
The halloween story a while back when it.
Was your turn all you said was i'm sorry.
I was your help i stay home cool good.
Nice see what i mean because that's what.
I did they won't cook right but that's.
Not a storm you know what regina can you.
Just please go oh sure we just go my.
Morning routine goes a little something.
Like this so the first thing i do in the.
Morning is wake up i usually turn wake.
00 or 100 p.m.
But lately i've been waking up even.
Earlier like 11 a.m. from the cold.
Because my stupid boyfriend steals all.
The blankets from me so i yell at him.
And he just ignores me the whole time.
And continues to sleep which makes me.
Really sad so i cry for about five to.
Ten minutes before i realized that wait.
I don't have a boyfriend so i get over.
It and that's when i hit to the bathroom.
Where the real fun begins i do all the.
Boring stuff first like turn on the.
Shower brush my teeth brush my hairs my.
Little push down stairs and by that time.
The showers steamy enough for me to.
Write my name in it so that i can take a.
Picture for in stores and snappies then.
Comes the fun part my mega i always.
Start with my foundation which if you.
Don't know is pretty much just power so.
Any kind of powder works but personally.
I use flour because i love flowers then.
Look and smell.
Beautiful and once i finished that i'd.
Do my lips i know most girls like using.
These coloring sticks but i prefer to.
Lip tint which is a technique that's.
Really popular in other countries.
Outside of nevada or basically all you.
Do is put some fruit punch or grape.
Juice whatever color you want in a bowl.
And just dip your lips for two maybe.
Three or four hours and you're done and.
Ready to do your eyes now some people.
Call it eyeliner some say eyeshadow but.
Really it doesn't matter because they're.
All the same thing and basically it's.
Just the coloring of your eyeball.
Section again i know most girls like to.
Cover their eyes with coloring sticks.
But i'm really not like that typical.
Basic batch so i like to use the fancier.
Foreign brands like crayola which stays.
On pretty nicely or like sharp piece.
Which is actually waterproof and won't.
Come off when you swim cry or even scrub.
For an hour and if you can't afford.
Those i found that you know those little.
Black balls that everybody gets every.
Christmas works really well i believe.
That brand is called shark wall or.
Something but that works too.
And after that i'm pretty much done and.
Ready to get the day started.
So i leave the bathroom and that's when.
I always see my blankets on my bed move.
So i go over there thinking wait maybe i.
Do have a boyfriend.
But when i check and remove the covers.
It's not my boyfriend at all it's me.
Under there i see myself sleeping and.
That's when i realized i was asked you.
Projecting the whole time so then i just.
Wake myself up by pulling off the cover.
So that i get really cold wake up and do.
It all over again.
Ah so would you guys say that was long.
Ah thank you uh anyway um who's next our.
Diesel what let's hear your morning.
Routine hopefully it won't be as long as.
We're jeana's though right why not you.
Trying to rush my routine what you.
Rushing me dawg you rush i gotta rush.
Like some kind of russian to you huh.
Yeah like a russian blue i don't get it.
Anyway like i was saying yeah go ahead.
And just take your time no rush.
Good now where was i where was i oh i.
Don't think you even started i wasn't.
Asking you that was a red oracle.
Question stupid anyway my morning starts.
A little something like this i wake up.
Grab my phone first thing i do jump on.
That clash of clans harvest gold elixir.
Build troops raid other building stuff.
Mecs candy crush it i guess stripes.
Again packets i get chocolates with the.
Sprinkles on top boom on to bray dungeon.
Pad to the 12 hour mark and back to the.
Basics that jump right back on that.
And repeat before i know it it's nice.
Then i just do it all over again.
So that's your full routine the non rush.
Version mm-hmm well then i guess we're.
Done with this right what what i mean.
All that's left is me and i don't have a.
Good made-up routine like you guys all i.
Have is a real one so what about me i.
Already told you we're not gonna let you.
Troll us again i'm not sure i you may.
Head just let him do it man yeah fine go.
Ahead then but i swear if you do that.
Cook rice joke one more time i'm sad.
Money routine not joke not joke at all.
My routine goes a little something like.
Please every morning i wake up afraid.
Afraid for my life gunfire screams for i.
Know what i hear banging on door someone.
Trying to break in that's when i grab.
The guns i keep under my pillow and.
Count down four three two one.
I fire the moment that door opens before.
I can even get a good look at who it is.
As i'm about to leave her realized i.
Know this man he's my father.
Tears start coming down my face like a.
Waterfall being chased by the tlc and i.
Just wrote get in my car and head.
Straight to my psychologist in ten years.
Because i don't know who else to talk to.
I tell him the whole story and he tells.
Me on today you shouldn't be sad cuz.
Your daddy didn't die i say what and.
That's when he tells me on a tape i am.
Your dad and i don't know what to do i i.
Don't know if i should feel happy or.
Betrayed and i just closed my eyes and.
Black out when i hope and then i found.
My psychologist my father dead i shot.
Him i hear sirens coming that's when i.
Get back in my car and start driving.
Again tears are coming down my face like.
A kpop star in that movie ninja.
Assassins like rain and it blurs my.
Vision right as an old lady crossing the.
Street a slamming mob breaks i lose.
Control of the car and hit her - no hope.
Lady i get out run over to her to see.
That she's barely alive then down next.
To her not able to convey how sorry i am.
When she stops me she tells me to come.
Closer and she whispers i forgive you.
Son and that's when i realized this.
Innocent old lady i killed wasn't not.
Dead to here started coming down my face.
Like that's enough hey i'm not done yeah.
Let him finish i want to hear the end so.
What did your tears come down your face.
Like oh just like bruce lee favorite.
Drink oh let me guess like wah ha no.
Like pepsi he liked pepsi i heard that.
Too.
Is that really your morning routine the.
Routine you do every morn i so you're.
Saying that you pretty much murder three.
Different people that claim that they're.
Your father every single morning when.
You get up.
Oh you mean.
Like with the song come on yes what did.
You think a morning routine was i.
Thought you mean morning like when you.
Said because people die oh morning with.

Not an easy mistake why would you even.
Think that that's what we're talking.
About don't be mean to him dude his.
Father just died all three of us hi okay.
Fine i get it there's some kind of.
Language barrier of some sort and i.
Don't know why in your head for some.
Reason you have a country accent i think.
His canadian accent no it's not not even.
Close but that's fine because now you.
