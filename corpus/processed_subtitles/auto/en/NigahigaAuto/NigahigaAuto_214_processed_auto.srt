Where i said the live experience the.
Live experience i should probably read.

I before i go live on top podcast i.
Should have that practice anyway thank.
You c key our first sponsor nice very.
Nice but now that we've taken care of.
That.
Pretty sick oh yeah there's so many new.
Things man we got the control how about.
This since you know this is like our.
First sponsor if you were to see a.
Concert or a sporting event.
Where would you go the first one i'd.
That they have listed here the nba spurs.
I actually have i mean i haven't used.
Seatgeek yet but i mean i've if they're.
Consistent spawns on we might get some.
Hookups your name yeah i mean this does.
That mean i get to consistently have a.
$20 off your first purchase that's what.
It says but i mean come on well just.
Type in he goes so that it looks good so.
That we look good and it's like oh man.
We got to give these guys more money oh.
Yeah what would you use or would you go.
I would want to go to like a comedy show.
Call me show ya cool i see i see a lot.
Of people act so black pink i think i.
Believe what's that oh man i hope i'm.
Not messing it up but they have a show.
In la now like a concert it's it's a.
K-pop group real popular and a lot of.
That i think yeah there's a k-pop group.
Yeah female k-pop group and ever heard.
They probably know this they like i see.
A lot of people on twitter trying to get.
Tickets and there's like two thousand.
People in the queue before them online.
And like people were buying tickets from.
Online vendors as white black pink whoo.
Yeah this is this new like an you know.
They've been away for a while but they.
Can't be like i mean they're not like an.
80s right no they're pretty big they're.
Bigger than bts they're not bigger than.
Bts but as a female group they're huge.
Yeah hey did you guys know get them i.
Don't know if there's this is gonna get.
Get us some hate but um did you guys.
Know that btw.
In korean means something what does it.
Mean the korean americans i think i.
Don't know about korean koreans what is.
This it stands they call bts actually.
Stands for some not that not that group.
Okay when they can't they say after you.
Know it's just saying in in i don't know.
About in korea but for korean americans.
Bts means burning dunkleman syndrome or.
Something like that.
Tong tong kamal is it tong come on i'm.
Not korean but i know it's like burning.
Toe come on sensation or something like.
That and that basically means like after.
You eat spicy food when you get fired no.
So bts actually means like fire poop.
Probably because they got fire.
That's probably the name of one of their.
Songs fire shoes or something like that.
That sounds like a bts sorry bts is high.
They have so many hardcore fans that.
Like even just now i had to be like man.
I should wear this very thing about them.
Is they have a lot of inspirational.
Songs that have like good meaning to.
Their lyrics but their fans how can you.
Understand it it's it's the lyrics and.
Like the meanings of stuff and you see.
Them you haven't translated but a lot.
It's weird cuz a lot of times certain.
Parts of their fandom will be way too.
Aggressive and like not live what.
They're praising you know so if they're.
Saying like yeah peace and unity and.
Then like their fans are like kind of.
Not doing this yeah that's like most.
People though cult it's a gold well.
Alright don't put this on this is does.
Not reflect the views called i mean.
That's theirs isn't that a sane cult.
Fandom yeah kind of thing so make sense.
Yeah but they are i mean like i mean.
From the moment we had we had bts.
Meaning behind the scenes on our second.
Channel videos since i don't know how.
Long and i don't know where or when it.
Started happening but all these people.
And i've just seen it grow over the.
Years these bts army fans have been.
There since i don't know do you remember.
When it started happening i don't.
Remember exactly but i just kept.
Thinking yeah you just use all of a.
Sudden there was all these people say.
Like bts army and then at first i.
Thought they met like this yeah i was.
Like yeah.
Yeah they're representing our behind the.
Scenes they really care about us.
Oh no they'd it's it's amazing how far.
They've come.
It's crazy and aren't are they like.
Considered them like most successful.
Kpop i would i would say so yeah ever i.
Would you know what i would at least in.
The us for sure they hit didn't they hit.
Like one of their first number one like.
The first korean has kpop band to hit.
Like number one in the billboards or.
Something but they were also on i think.
Like time magazine like the front the.
Front page mmm really i can't even i.
Can't picture a bunch of asians on time.
Magazine let alone one yeah i don't know.
They don't really read do they all speak.
Korean or do they like they've learned.
English so they do interviews in english.
And stuff like for the audience yeah.
Yeah yeah that's so crazy.
Well you know it's crazy that i thought.
I thought kpop was kind of like dying.
Mm-hmm.
I mean that's why i did we didn't really.
Like keep going with a whole bga thing.
But yeah i mean people keep asking i.
Thought i thought you would get tired of.
It you know by the second one i still.
Working on another oh you heard what.
That is not off the press is it uh what.
Is it called when you give out.
Information that makes exclusives yeah.
That copyright can we do that well i.
Mean if you guys are doing a mother.
Working on another song yeah yeah you.
Guys could get a show and have a concert.
And then people could get their tickets.
At sikhi there you go see it your show.
At or see you could set it up because we.
Can't afford to put on my god those got.
That kind of fanbase buying all that.
Stuff all that merch how about you will.
How about you where would i go i would.
Probably pick a concert honestly i'm.
Usually not too picky when it comes to.
Concerts i mean as long as it's like a.
Music group that i like i'm down you.
Know or sports like go into a like a fun.
Sports event go most like support jeremy.
Or who sees spurs like i'm down.
Siegy jeremy just went over to the.
Raptors yeah yep he's uh because you.
Don't know jeremy lynn yeah jeremy lynn.
Just.
It wasn't trade he's bought out.
Basically he's on he went from the.
Atlanta hawks who are in the bottom.
Probably five teams in the whole league.
To literally like the top maybe like the.
Top three team so he legit has a chance.
To win a ring not likely because the.
Golden state's always going to be the.
Favorite but god we got i don't know.
Don't get me going on basketball.
Basketball.
Nobody cares about basketball whose.
Leaves you grabbing in basketball we're.
Gonna do a side podcast of ryan in.
Support i know i want to do like a.
Sports podcast so there's this um.
There's this player on the raptors.
Actually danny green who has a podcast.
Called the green room i think he has a.
Podcast yeah gangrena so oh but i mean.
I'm a fan because you know he's uh he.
Was a spur yeah one of my favorite spurs.
But he got traded within the whole kawhi.
Leonard trade again i think i don't know.
If we should stand the topic of.
Basketball but basically has a he has a.
Podcast and i would definitely be dumb.
And if he's down danny green actually.
There's a chance now we have a.
Connection we i can tell jeremy a get.
Danny green hey let's get oh you don't.
Be funny we gotta get kawhi leonard and.
See how much we can get him to talk oh.
That would be good honestly you would be.
Good for like a sports like podcast tell.
If you like to talk about basketball and.
Maybe like fighting yeah like ufc or mma.
These are your hobbies and it's it is.
Your paw fighter you know no it's your.
Hobbies that yeah but you like those i.
Know it's like it's such a different.
Even when i tweet and i tweet about like.
When i'm watching fights and stuff my.
Ria every um my replies are so like.
Empty because nobody cares all like the.
People who follow me and stuff do not.
Associate me with basketball or with mma.
Or any of that but that's like my.
Interests we're about to have a second.
Channel podcast for sports first channel.
Is sponsored by see these get off the.
Topic of sports.
Yeah sports because i already know.
You're so uninterested it'll be.
On the side podcast well i mean it's.
Like hobbies so why don't we just go.
Into hobbies and stuff cuz this i guess.
When it's us and it's not about the.
Guests and we're s have any guests like.
You know the audience just want to get.
To know us a little bit more and hear.
About like what things we like to do so.
Ryan you know a lot of people are.
Curious like oh when you're making when.
You're not making videos which is almost.
247 what do you like to do in your free.
Time cuz even i mean not making videos.
247 because you're always like working.
We talked about it on the podcast thank.
You minotaur we're not i thought you.
Mean i'm not working on videos 247 i.
Was like that's pretty much all we do.
Nice i think i said when you're not okay.
Video yeah which is got it okay yeah.
Then what like what are your what are.
Your hobbies that you actually like to.
Do in your spare time did i actually do.
I mean yeah i think it talked about this.
Like just video games video games yeah.
Basketball watching best one fighting.
Just pretty much there's not that much.
Honestly very boring people we don't go.
Out normally unless people are in town.
Actually yeah that's that's pretty much.
The only time we ever go out we're very.
Boring people actually you go out a.
Light right ooh go out i exercise a.
Hobby kind of like stay fit you know.
That's i mean that's a deficit me.
Anytime.
Yep you have quite a few too many you're.
An outdoorsman for sure i have too many.
I'm like a hobbyist for hobbies like.
Hobbies are my hobby.
Pretty much like there was one time.
Where i kind of got into this tabletop.
Game called warhammer and was basically.
Like models and painting and it just.
Like it put together a lot of things.
That i like to do so like models and.
Then i also like playing word games and.
I also like painting so it was like very.
Easy for me to be like man i want to.
Like get into it and i had fun doing it.
I kind of stopped for a little bit cuz.
It's a lot of money in time and and.
Stuff but and then i got into board.
Games and if i collected tabletop board.
Games computer games any other games you.
Can add that list so pretty much we're.
Just a bunch of because popular yours.
You play video games that's like -.
Alright.
Yeah much it's like almost like a.
Borderline addiction i think especially.
For you yeah cuz you will sacrifice your.
Sleep like even come into work and be.
Like oh you didn't sleep for like you.
Only set up a couple hours cuz you're.
Playing video games that night til.
However a.m. in the morning sleep a.
Little bit and you wake up and play.
Games before you come in and like you.
Just look exhausted yeah that's nice.
Because you know that you you know that.
Yeah there's now i got deven like i mean.
It it's true you have like an addiction.
To gaming yeah i mean like okay so ryan.
Has always said like oh you have an.
Addictive personality which is like i.
Get addicted to things very quickly yes.
Like things that easily interest me i.
Will just dive into very hard and i just.
Go through like little seasons of habit.
So kind of like you like having hobbies.
Yeah but i go to the extent of not.
Eating or sleeping sometimes just.
Learning about these do you guys i mean.
Have you that's a good that's also not.
Necessarily a horrible quality some.
People with addictive personalities.
Actually become you know some of the.
Best athletes some of the best like.
Because if you're spending that much.
Time on something you're bound to be.
Good at it you know if you're gonna.
Spend that much of your time.
Investing in like studying and figuring.
Out how you're gonna be better at.
Whatever it is like i mean that's how.
You become good right like yeah you kind.
Of have to be an addict to a certain.
Degree yeah but i think i could spend my.
Time on a lot better things yeah you.
Could but i'm just saying like people.
With addictive personalities if you.
Think about it like michael phelps he's.
Probably addicted to swimming you know.
Like he's probably can't focuses on oh.
How can i become a faster swimmer or how.
Should i train and same thing with any.
Every basketball player i'm sure they.
Watch tape on themselves like people.
With addictive personalities are.
Actually the people who succeed usually.
Yeah i can't think of many people who.
Are completely successful who aren't.
That kind of personality.
So because you're successful in making.
Videos would you say that you were.
Addicted to making videos or making.
People laugh or what made you grab onto.
Youtube very very late with with your.
Whole life i guess i mean i think i was.
Um it also changes a lot i think you.
Have to be a dick.
Did for me i was addicted to the fact of.
Trying to create things that i couldn't.
Do in the past they create new things.
And try and create things that are.
Different and then it's very it's very.
Unsatisfying when i have to settle for.
Something that's not something new even.
If it does well even if i create a video.
That does really well it's sometimes.
Super unsatisfying for me because it's.
Just like man i already did a video like.
This or i already did this joke but in a.
Different way it's not unique you know.
So like what videos would those be a.
Video that did well that i didn't that.
You weren't unsatisfied i mean there's a.
Lot and there's videos that i kind of.
Even go through all of them but just the.
One that's sticking out right now one.
That sticks out that did well yeah that.
I am not necessarily proud of like was.
It fortnight or in a fortnight we did.
Some new things and then which i was.
Like kind of happy about i would say.
Probably something along the lines of.
Like a evenly like when we did the how.
To be ninja - mmm it's like it's kind of.
A parody of a parody and it was just.
Like oh well you know what it was fun.
Because we did the fighting thing and.
That was different.
Yeah but the rest of it was just like an.
Ecstatic my excuse to kind of uh do.
Something different by using something.
That's not if that makes sense yeah yeah.
Yeah so it was my it was my wig i.
Literally all i want to do is do that.
Fight scene so i wrote the entire script.
That'd be just good enough not great.
The whole rest of is not it's not good.
It's just like basic like jokes they're.
Not to me at least it's not the most.
Creative thing in the world but i was.
Very satisfied and i was happy with it.
Because of the end scene because it was.
We didn't do anything like that we never.
Did an action sequence like that.
So i mean that's my version i guess yeah.
I would say probably it's it's probably.
Safe to assume that if there's any kind.
Of like cinematic qualities you're.
Usually pushing for like that's usually.
You trying to push it into like a new.
Realm of like making it higher quality.
And then if it's like a list or like.
Something where it's like more flog.
Heavy that's probably something you're.
Less likely to be satisfied with right.
Yeah no i mean it's just like i use i i.
Mean especially before i used to use.
These videos to like sneak in things so.
If i wanted to act more i would put in a.
Scene where it has to be more dependent.
On acting versus just straight-up jokes.
But then i but then obviously those.
Don't usually do as well cuz it's it's.
Not what people are used to it and what.
They want right you just want the same.
Specific format for the most part i mean.
Whether they they i don't know people.
Were listening agree or not it reflects.
In the numbers yeah it's always show and.
The likes and dislike ratio so and then.
Despite what people say that's that's.
Just how it is alright proof is in the.
Pudding because i feel like we said that.
Last time no no see i remember reference.
Is hobbies so your hobby is gaming right.
Yeah and that's it pretty much like.
That's your main hobby huh oh and video.
Making that's i just like my main.
Hobbies making people laugh so stand up.
Yeah just any form of comedy i just like.
That not so much making videos making.
Videos is just a way to make people.
Laugh right right so let's talk about.
This new hobby you both have been into.
The fishing you've been trying to know.
Who's fishing is great no it's not you.
Missed out that's when sean was here i.
Was talking about that game you keep.
Trying to get me to play a pape x yeah.
I'm not even a fan of it you're never.
Supporter.
Like anything that becomes popular if he.
Was if if we weren't into apex or if.
Nobody was really into it you'd be like.
This game so dope you guys gotta try it.
But the moment it becomes popular he's.
Like not even about that dude i remember.
When we were in for tonight was getting.
Big and i was telling me i was like hey.
This game he was into pub g cuz i was.
Like the you know less popular one in.
The original and i stopped playing for g.
Because i was playing for tonight this.
Is years ago more than oh you did.
Because i said they're coming out with a.
Game oh yeah but you didn't play it but.
You were you refused you're like oh.
You're one of those you play for tonight.
And then.
Wasn't few months later he's just the.
Guy playing more for tonight than i ever.
Played and he's just like and he was the.
One telling me oh wow you're playing for.
Tonight i'm a pub chief i play real.
Games yeah it was a better game.
Mogi yeah well not in terms of numbers i.
Don't think it is you are like that.
Though yeah i would say so it's a quote.
It's not a bad call it's just funny that.
It's like it is if someone if someone.
Tells you dude you gonna watch this show.
This show is is amazing like i love the.
Show you your first reaction is like all.
Right whatever and then you watching.
You're like what's cool even if in the.
Back of your head you're like no no no.
No no not true at all i don't think i.
Think it actually makes him believe that.
It isn't good when it when it could be.
Because he sets himself up for.
Expectations.
Yeah there's but you know what there's a.
Lot of people like that and that is like.
The hipster mentality and it makes me.
Curious like what looks like let's break.
This down a little bit let's go inside.
The mind of paco.
Wyatt what makes you you know you you're.
Aware and you acknowledge acknowledge.
That that's how you think so why do you.
Know why or well for me a lot of it is.
Like there's a it's like you know how.
You said like a general audience will.
Like a certain thing and it's not.
Necessarily the smartest or the funniest.
Or the most well thought out and so.
That's where i'm coming from.
Well i'm like okay this may be good to a.
Larger audience.
Sure but does it do i like it or am i.
Gonna like it because other people are.
Like you like apex no i don't don't lie.
No i after i played it a couple of times.
I was like oh it's just in another b are.
You like it no reason why i don't like.
It is because it's it's very fast-paced.
Similar black ops and that's why i liked.
Pub g cuz it was slower is more.
Thought-out yeah you know there's no.
There's other ways that you can see that.
Yeah okay i guess so i don't know that's.
Like for tonight for tonight's a kind of.
A faster pace in pub but it's it's it's.
It's it's faster than pub g but it's.
Slower than black ops in apex yeah i.
Guess so so i have the ability to still.
Try and think my way out of situation.
Here yeah okay.
Yeah well well for that specific.
I get that but i mean you like you said.
You acknowledge that that's a quality of.
You yeah yeah yeah and i'm still trying.
To figure out the root of that i think.
It's something a lot cuz we know i know.
A lot of people like that it's not just.
You know yeah i mean that's what a.
Hipster is right it's that that's like.
The stereo just want ya the stereotype.
Stereotypical hipster right right.
Somebody who wants to be different from.
The mainstream sure i don't know if.
That's a good definition they don't want.
To be caught liking what's hot or like.
Yeah i mean that's like i don't know.
What the technical term i don't wanna.
Offend people i know i told greg once.
That he was a hipster not knowing it was.
A bad thing and it's cuz he has a.
Mustache and you know he had like you.
Would wear like overalls and stuff like.
I don't think he mean was just drinking.
So i don't know it sure i didn't mean it.
Like you know make it was at the time it.
Wasn't a negative thing yeah i think i.
Was just oh it's like a hipster thing i.
Was living in la and you know we were.
Drinking all these jar things i was like.
Oh yeah greg's pretty hipster and i.
Think he got legit offended wasn't a.
Mason jar i don't know we were like i'm.
One of those typical la places with like.
A jar where they put water i just want a.
Cup i don't want a jar loom you know i.
Mean yeah and that's pretty hipster it.
Is it is yeah jason jar oh anyway um i.
Was it makes me think like i kind of i.
Get that but like what makes somebody.
Like that is the fact that they're.
Insecure about the fact that they need.
To be different or is it because they.
Feel like they need to be it's cooler to.
Not be hmm.
Similar cuz everybody wants alright this.
Is my thought process as to why i'm like.
That and it's just because i was always.
Kind of different and i was seen as.
Different and that's almost my identity.
And so because for my whole life i've.
Been different and i like different.
Things right there's no reason for me to.
Like normal stuff seep no but see i'm i.
Grew up very different too you know i'm.
I think is my insecurities and my the.
Way i coped with it is the opposite that.
I would try to fit in so it was much.
Less cool with that but this is because.
I'm a stronger person than you thought.
Yeah different that is probably exactly.
Why all right arm wrestle.
I don't want to beat him so here's a.
Question for you then if it was uncool.
To be different back in the day and now.
It's cool to be different are you gonna.
Be not different you got me andy.
Catch-22 is it mean that much to you.
Would you like flip-flop no i think for.
Me is just that make sense you know.
Because it's like i get what you're.
Saying.
Yeah but i think for me i'm gonna do.
What i find interesting in what i like.
No but but we're saying is sometimes.
What you find interesting is affected by.
What everyone else finds interesting.
Yeah hmm and that's the web part i wanna.
Figure out it's not even like if there.
Was a vortex more like a a a world.
Universe where you're literally just by.
Yourself you have all these different.
Routes and choices you can make like oh.
I want to be into this gate i wanna do.
This hobby you would probably pick.
Something completely your route your.
Tree your route tree would be completely.
Different from what it is in this.
Reality i think you've heavily in.
Affected by what other people think yes.
And no because if i like something like.
Yes pub she was very popular it was it.
Was it was i was still like it's true oh.
I really like this game and i stuck with.
It i played it a lot so if i do like it.
What is popular i will stick with it but.
When fortnight got popular and i told.
You to hop on it yeah what did you tell.
Me i was like oh gross yeah though is a.
Little kid who plays portney that's your.
Reaction like you're in like natural.
Yeah yeah because it was at the time.
When i told it to him i was like dude.
It's bigger it's bigger than pub g like.
Way bigger.
Why don't you just play this it's so.
Like there's a reason why people are.
Playing it hmm see i i think i'm very i.
Get that mentality but i am uh i guess i.
Was just a little some nerd trying to.
Fit in you know yeah cuz you liked it.
And you were like all this game six oh.
Yeah and especially the for the fact.
That people are playing it like you know.
Even more some but like okay i want to.
Be in you know and be way in with the.
Cool kids.
It's yeah i don't i i can't do that.
Stuff so well regardless i think ryan.
Would probably like apex because he.
Likes black ops anyway yeah for the.
People who don't have context to why i.
Brought this up yeah will has every for.
Every shoot has been trying to pitch me.
To play this game yeah and it's not.
About me not trying to fit in because i.
Know what the games getting big yeah.
Huge this season thing is this i'm so.
Different i'm such a bad way like if it.
Gets big in about probably jump on the.
Opposite of paco because you see like oh.
There's a lot of people playing so you.
See the value yeah and i should probably.
Learn about it yeah.
Like even just for youtube but i think.
I'm pretty good at seeing a game and.
Being like oh i think ryan would like.
This cuz i know what kind of plate likes.
Play style you like and i remember.
Seeing fortnight a long long long time.
Ago and the reason why i said to you.
Even before it came out they were.
Working on like their tower defense.
Version to the single-player and i was.
Like ryan this game is for you like we.
Got like we gotta play this and you like.
You actually probably like that mode.
Better huh yeah i mean i i personally do.
I like games that you um not just games.
I just like things where you if you're.
Working on something if you don't put.
Time and effort into it that you keep.
Keep that status or like you keep.
Growing within i am not as big of a fan.
Of something that you just play and then.
You start over yeah yeah that make sense.
Um just because i feel like it's a it's.
Not worth the time yeah you know what.
They're not a sponsor of this point no.
Absolutely not.
So apex great let's move on from that.
Enough apex it's about the 30 minute.
Mark so and you said seatgeek.
Oh yeah yeah you're right i well we have.
To take the shishi break and then we'll.
Come back yeah i don't know that the.
Shishito being either but we have to.
Take the cheesy break it's our normal.

A second time second one come on bring.
It bring it.

That's the money real what you just got.
Paid that's like a fishing reel i don't.
Know if i'm supposed to read the same.
Thing twice.
But we have been bringing up sikhi kola.
I don't think we normally have to do.
This but i'm just gonna bring it up.
Again.
Just a reminder in case for whatever.
Reason you jump ahead to the if you're.
One of the people who just jump ahead of.
The shishu break i will say that when.
After our she she breaks i think our.
Podcast get better i think so too i.
Think it's because we're warmed up and.
We're talking like normal anyway back to.
Seeking our sponsor again see geek.
It is a ticket app again i'm gonna say.
The same thing because i didn't write.
Anything else down that makes buying.
Super simple and basically i don't think.
I have to say this again nobody you.
Wanna get events online huh.
No if you want to get you can find all.
Events on seatgeek like literally.
Anything but mba whatever whatever you.
Wanna get tickets for you can get on.
Seatgeek.

Your clothes usually leave your.
Underwear on or put on a little leave.

How do you know cuz i see you oh you see.
Every single person i saw i saw the.
Washer and dryer okay and he's just.
Going to a nice nice spot speaking of.
Massage this is just a quick little.
Thing i'm gonna say one time me and ryan.
We're on a vacation oh no we were on a.
Work trip in indonesia i think and we.
Were getting a massage and the girl we.
Were in the same room the girls that.
Were misogynist or burping we've just.
Had i don't know what.
Lunch or something we thought we were.
Getting pranked legit here in indonesia.
And for a show i believe yeah i gotta i.
Gotta add on to this story by the way.
But look anyway let me finish this we're.
Into indonesia and we told um the guy.
Who was taking us out basically like oh.
He's like what you guys one do i was.
Like oh booked massages for you guys.
It's two to a room so it's like a couple.
Of massages but it's obviously mean.
We'll and then i forget who else was.
With us everybody is to do a room yeah.
Mine anyway me and we are in here and.
We're getting massage and these girls.
Come in is indonesian women and they.
Just keep like the cute going like the.
Whole time for over an hour jit like.
Over an hour maybe not that loud but it.
Was like you could hear like someone.
Trying to hold back their burp and they.
Just kept burping yeah and then like at.
One point i think like 20 minutes in.
Like they left the room and once we.
Broke you know like when when you and.
Your friend are laughing and you have.
That connection and we just didn't say.
There's of woke we both laid up from the.
Little hole look at each other and you.
Started laughing they came back and we.
Had to shut up we put our faces back in.
The hole and i could still hear a little.
Bit and my i was in like the shoulder.
Shake it was so fly i couldn't stop.
Laughing and he just kept burping i.
Don't know i mean it was a great massage.
I thought it was a really funny story i.
Could have swore that like some could.
Swore that i don't know if you were.
Thinking this but i thought for sure.
We're being filmed yeah somebody was.
Like playing a prank on us.
Totally cuz they set up that massage.
Yeah book it like we didn't walk in.
There it was like set up for us so i was.
Like oh my we're getting pranked like.
I'm waiting for the cameras to come out.
Or whatever it was surreal.
Like it was like but it was because they.
Were both doing it maybe if one of them.
Was just like you know for an hour of.
Burping like every like five second.
Seconds it was crazy.
That's the story that's it friends in la.
Yeah i know.
Oh and i drove home yeah hit me up but.
Because you're busy working with david.
Oh the first two days yeah yeah i was no.
Liam.

Driving home on valentine's day so i.
Spent the day driving from la to vegas.
And then being single and playing video.
Games.
Oh yeah it's good stories it's great.
Story what do you do i first ryan.
Literally just released a video.
Hopefully okemo saying who he's dating.
Right i did just release a video thing.
Who i'm dating you so we can say this.
Now and this unless it doesn't come out.
Then it's this off the pill i know if.
That video is not it better be done.
Better be out before this comes out on.
Sunday yes i just i guess yesterday.
Technically it would be hope specific.
Dates anyway yeah i just i just said.
That i just released that i am dating.
Arden which most people had already.
Known do claps thanks yeah.
We have we've been dating for a long.
Time yeah oh while yeah i mean it's.
Things we never said we're gonna hide it.
Per se but um we just didn't we didn't.
Feel the necessary to announce it we.
Don't want to make it like one of those.
Channels where they just make their.
Things about the relationships yeah i.
Mean it becomes like messy i think it.
Becomes like it puts a strain a.
Different unnecessary pressure yeah on.
The relationship makes sense and you.
Guys it means your own private life i.
Mean yeah to a certain extent but anyway.
Did yeah we didn't try to hide it but we.
Just didn't announce it yeah a lot of.
People already knew yeah.
What uh so what did you guys do for.
Valentine's um valentine's day while i.
Was there first of all to work with.
David on another song oh sure you've.
Been off a little off today yeah no.
Basically what we did was on valentine's.
Day we just had a dinner.
To this place because i was still on.
Keto and it was a brazilian brazilian.
Steak place that's like that other place.
Where people come around and they just.
Cut me off uh they literally come to.
Your table and they say hey you won bist.
This yeah you stick your fork out and.
They cut off a piece of meat and they.
Have all these different kinds of cuts.
Of meat sauce guys those places are.
Super good it was really especially when.
You're on keto did you you're sick dude.
You're sick congratulations on the.
Announcement of yeah were you guys.
Surprised so shocked i didn't know no.
Every time everyone every time anyone.
Asked me dating i just go some of my.
Business won't you just tweet them you.
Just ask him like there's so many.
Pictures all with like fans and stuff.
Like that it's like so obvious we just.
Never really um we just didn't announce.
It yeah it's like unnecessary but it's.
Just easier especially when we doing.
This and like if she's gonna be on it to.
Like just it would be weird to not talk.
About sure you know to avoid that but.
Yeah we didn't again not that special.
Didn't do anything special i mean going.
To a nice steak house yes that's a good.
One.
And you don't make that steak house.
Better is if you kissed do you what is.
Wrong with you today is wrong with you.
What is wrong with me every day no this.
Is like extra wrong and weird i'm pretty.
Just tired yeah i think we're all those.
Are i feel like we've been talking about.
This a lot so when i'm tired i just.
Wonder if my friends are kissing.
Yeah pretty and that's my thing no i.
Think you did the way that you're making.
It sound like he's like you're getting.
Some kind of enjoyment out of picturing.
I not picturing you guys like knowing my.
Boys or you know i'm sure they kiss here.
Yeah but i want to hear from him you.
Know we just have to keep wondering i'm.
Not gonna be able to sleep until i know.
I mean we just started dating yesterday.
So.
That fast when you kiss everybody in the.
First date.
Wow yeah i know we're all acting a.
Little weird today sorry guys people.
Listening we were just we literally.
Filmed all day today we had to do this.
Podcast though.
How about we've been consistent so far.
Yeah yeah no no no i was gonna say like.
Why we just you know talk about a normal.
Shoot day what its usual describe it.
What's kind of interesting i think i.
Mean maybe not tell us but i don't know.
I don't know it's not that interesting.
They see bts i just watch bts.
I mean break it down very simple start.
At 10 that's a that's like our most.
Common start time 10 o'clock come on.
Usually we're come on ryan's someone.
Picks up like a lot of the equipment we.
Meet over here unload it we'll have like.
A shot list that's created by dana and.
Then we'll match the equipment to it and.
Start with whatever whatever.
Um shots and film until we're super.
Tired see i told you guys i was really.
Boring and then we do a podcast with.
Zero energy i know well you know what.
This is our first time that we're doing.
It that i actually feel pretty exhausted.
Yeah we went a little bit long i feel.
Bad about this podcast like we i don't.
Even remember what we talked about to be.
Honest i had its moments it had four.
Energy drinks today and that's god above.
My limit oh i almost forgot.
I was gonna bring up the other story.
About when we were talking about.
Indonesia and a funny story about that.
And um i don't think i've ever said this.
Publicly but uh apparently at that show.
I met rich chigga oh really he was at.
Our show i was there yeah he was he was.
At the show and he was i have a picture.
With him.
He sent it to me and he's like crazy huh.
That's not his name anymore by the way.
Oh yeah rich bryan is it racist to see.
Chica well i mean he i didn't i didn't.
Make that up like okay well people know.
I'm rich i'm brian rich i think he just.
Goes by brian now no.
That's awfully similar no but yeah he.
Sent me a dm i don't think he cares that.
I'm saying this anyway but he sent me a.
Dm i'll just like because i guess i was.
Following him this is after that big his.
First big song when he was wearing the.
Polo with the pink polo hmm that that.
Video kind of went bad i was like oh.
This guy's funny man like this guy's.
Super funny so i didn't think he was.
Serious about right i thought i was like.
He was like doing like lonely island.
Kind of stuff anyway i was i was.
Following him he d and me as i call it.
Send me a picture of me and him and i.
Was like what this what is where's this.
From and it was like apparently who's.
That our indonesia show no idea but.
Anyway um but you couldn't at the time.
Know like when you meet him hey you're.
Gonna make a song no i mean i did not.
Know obviously but i just had no idea.
That cuz he wasn't he was backstage.
Where the picture it wasn't like a like.
A meeting greeting no backstage so he.
Must have been somebody a part of that.
You know behind the scenes it's a crew.
People so yeah anyway that's what it's.
Only because we were talking about yeah.
You know why because everybody likes it.
That's what you it's off mate um okay.
Speaking of valentine's day and you.
Probably like the person you're with.
Segue we got a topic here that i.
Actually do like well you did like read.
It paco hit me with it.
It literally says can you like oh guys.
We're so tired anyway this is a good.
Topic i wanted to talk about this.
Alright well the topic is uh is it.
Possible can you like someone's art even.
If you don't like the artist like for.
Instance the whole r.kelly situation.
Which is going on right now there have.
Been many documentaries articles you.
Know exposing how he had harassed and.
Abused people sexually many of which.
Were underage mm-hmm and a lot of people.
Are calling for artists who have.
Collaborated with him to call him out on.
That so is it possible that you can.
Define the person as he admitted to this.
I'm not too sure yet or like been proven.
It's hard to say because i also like.
What if we find out i mean obviously i'm.
Not trying to defend him yeah and it.
Seems a consensus that it's true yeah.
What if we find out later down the road.
Like holy crap we were wrong and then we.
Start adding i think they have physical.
Evidence of some okay so that hasn't.
Been proven then yeah but there's so.
Many different cases you can think of.
Like how do you know do you still like.
Watching the cosby show do you still.
Like maybe an actor even if they have.
Like different political views like yeah.
Or movies that were created by weinstein.
Yes like a ton of great movie exactly i.
When i read this it was something i had.
Thought about before i kind of see some.
Most people from what i read at least.
And not that i've seen the document i.
Haven't seen a document me neither and i.
Don't know if they're completely true.
I'm assuming that they are but i don't.
Want to i'm not gonna say that they are.
Or not because i don't know but from.
What i've read from what people wrote.
Like you know i have friends on facebook.
Twitter and stuff like that they're all.
Like it's your i don't care if you like.
The song i used to like it's tough you.
Can't support it the consensus is like.
You can't like the you can't like the.
Art if the artist is like that but i.
Don't completely agree with it i think.
I'm in the same boat as he actually yeah.
But moat you beat i think people are.
Gonna be very upset about hearing obama.
Saying that but i feel like i mean the.
Reason why i liked i get not supporting.
Them like not buying certain exactly i.
Get that but like it's something that is.
Pleasurable to you like in your ears or.
In visually like you can't help but feel.
A certain way about something yeah you.
Know you're not trying to you don't like.
Him because of our kelly the person it's.
It's just good good content its whatever.
He's crazy but like even in the wine see.
Thing what are some movies that harvey.
Said his name harvey weinstein you're.
Lying so what movies that he's created.
So many big movies um and like really or.
Not just him but he's a part of so many.
Big movies in like i can't just all of a.
Sudden that i found out he's this.
Horrible person that you know i can't.
Say oh i hated i hate them when i'm not.
Gonna i understand not supporting it but.
Like you already have supported right.
Right um i guess it's different with.
Movies but like well i think i mean i.
Think it's pretty similar.
Like you said it comes down to obviously.
There's a difference between continually.
Or continuing to support the artists in.
Terms of like buying the songs or going.
To the concerts or whatever but in terms.
Of a song existing and you listening to.
It and being like oh i still like the.
Song like it's i think that's probably i.
Think that's okay i think you know so i.
Have the solution to it you do yeah.
So if you don't like the artists but you.
Do like the art what you can do pirate.
Exactly download it illegally you don't.
Support them strew and you still get to.
Experience the pleasure and this sea but.
People already say you shouldn't be.
Enjoying their art kelly's music well i.
Don't know about other like i don't know.
If with me like movies and stuff like.
That but i've read like i had to stop.
List i completely stopped listening to.
Our kelly i deleted all my songs with.
Our kelly it's even artists i'm say i.
Took off you know people who.
Collaborated with him said i took off i.
Don't know what they took it off ebay.
Spotify or itunes like i took my songs.
Off who was it there's a few celebrities.
That did that i singers i think there's.
One main one i was a tailor so not too.
Sure mm-hmm.
It might no not tailors i know what it.
Makes sense why would he be working with.
Johnny she was a little kid when he was.
Popular that's why off the pill another.
One that's kind of like this is help.
What's his name chris pratt is getting.
Kind of like flak wow because he was.
I forgot what talk-show he was on he was.
Talking about how he's with a church or.
Like an organization and that church is.
Kind of in line with like anti-gay i see.
And so though he was getting like flack.
For that and like a lot of people and.
That i kind of thought of that when i.
Heard that because then it's like do you.
Not like his movies anymore or like any.
Of the movies who's associated with or.
You know i mean like that's kind of in.
Line i think a little bit where trust is.
Like they'd they you can still maybe.
Like it.
This is why i think you can like it but.
What the trance is like you can't watch.
It anymore.
Cuz you can't control what you like but.
You can control what you watch you think.
That's what they're saying or that's.
What you're saying no i mean i think.
That's that's what they're saying i.
Think it's okay to still watch it to be.
Honest and i think i still i'm never.
Gonna buy another r.kelly song yeah that.
I really buy songs anymore but if like a.
Certain song comes on and i don't even.
The thing is i don't even know sometimes.
Oh our kelly sings this like okay that.
Doesn't change how i feel about the song.
Yeah it may be like in in playing it out.
Loud then i'd be like be careful why i.
Played around but like i if i didn't.
Know like it doesn't change based on.
What that person is for me at least i.
Don't support artists in the same way i.
Go by the song it's like are you kind of.
Coming at it from or agree with us in.
The sense of like you can support an.
Artist without a green with them on.
Certain things you can like the art you.
Don't necessarily up there like the.
Artist right yeah i agree with that you.
Do 100 we need someone to be politically.
Correct here so i'm gonna say you guys.
Are horrible people okay and i'm gonna.
Flip to then pop oh you can't you're.
Horrible that's messed up huh yeah i.
Mean you guys don't like you can't play.
His music anywhere he can i mean for one.
Obviously you can't buy it but you also.
Can't like it your habit you can't space.
Jam is one of the greatest movies of all.
Time you can't think about it and they.
Have i believe i can fly in there.
That is true oh speaking of which i.
Don't know if you guys know this or not.
I think i told you already but did you.
Know he says suck mod he does he says.
Yeah it's subliminal i'm pretty sure.
It's a true thing it's like in the.
Enemy's like yelling like flying that.
Thing is run he goes woo segment no.
Listen to it again.
You're trying to get me anyway yeah that.
It's it's an even connect that too he he.
Did it don't assume you know you know.
What no it's all adding up he's doing.
Putting subliminal messages thing about.
That is a lot of artists put subliminal.
Messages and you are one.
I have some subliminal things in my some.
Of my songs a lot of your songs yeah but.
It's just for fun just for like me and.
David mmm i just tell you guys about it.
After the fact.
People can go listen to it if they find.
It great but i don't care basically what.
Happens is listen to song everybody goes.
Hey i said this right here and then it.
Says it and i go it's either like really.
Quietly or it's like played like like.
Behind something kind of like the.
R.kelly thing it's not saying suck my.
Yeah that's saying that so this is the.
Other extreme of it right so can you.
Like someone's art even if you don't.
Like the artist is there a threshold to.
Where if there's so so bad of a person.
Will it stop you from listening and.
Supporting like huh like hitler hitler.
Made mo baba.
If hitler made the most fire hits hitler.
Made the best hit and then you found out.
Like who hitler was right like say he.
Didn't know would you listen to his.
Music or would you be like okay that's.
Too far right if he made the most and it.
Was like iconic right and it was another.
Yeah okay well i mean honestly i'm not.
Comparing our hey she's not your fault.
If you didn't know and you'd like the.
Song it's not your fault but i don't.
Think you should be buying it or.
Supporting the artists in the same it's.
The same things like it still sticks to.
It i don't think you should be i mean i.
Personally am not gonna go out of my way.
To listen to an hour kill a song right.
It doesn't help his case it doesn't mean.
I don't like his previous songs cuz i.
Didn't know that about him when i heard.
It and like liked the song it's like.
Nostalgia for us yeah i think for me you.
Know a lot of those songs like even like.
In the space jam when i believe i can.
Fly is that the title yeah or something.
Like that hey that's what sing it no.
Seriously so sorry.
Yeah anyway i forgot to say pc news of.
The week this is kind of peace enos.
Right yeah the week that was the outro.
It's pretty good yeah anyway.
Moving on we're about to move on to.
Twitter questions actually yes we got to.
Finish let's finish it up with some yeah.
So we have a twitter account you can.
Follow it off the pill at off the pill.
Head off the pill yeah and one of the.
Questions graham to instagram is off the.
Pill podcast so i believe yes on.
Instagram yeah and one of the questions.
For the twitter was how do you become.
Motivated when you're in a rut and you.
Don't want to do anything and i think.
That's a great question especially for.
Ryan because pretty much all of last.
Year he was in a rut i think yeah i'm.
Dude what'd you get roasted dude i think.
That's a very rude thing to say but that.
Is a good question yeah well i mean i.
Think i mean i did talk about it and.
That was it this year or the last you.
Know this year the first one the first.
Video yeah what's different but goes.
Back to what we were talking about.
Earlier as well of like me deciding to.
Do things that i want to do like this.
Podcast like it's like something i would.
Have never posted and i already knew.
Like the views we're gonna drop and.
Obviously they did but you know it's.
Because it's long-form content and it's.
Not necessarily what people come here to.
See sure but it's something that i've.
Always been wanting to do and i'm i i.
Have fun doing and i think for me it's.
Rediscovering why i did youtube in the.
First place and that was to have fun.
Creating new things and doing things.
That are different that i'm not getting.
Tired of yeah and for me it's i think.
When you're in a rut in anyway you got.
To figure out why and i think if you.
Really look at yourself and be like okay.
This is you're in a rut for what reason.
I don't know if it's gonna if this is.
The same scenario for this person but at.
Least for me come from my perspective.
You have to i think you have to get to a.
Certain point where you feel like you.
Feel so stuck that you have to you have.
No choice but to kind kind of look at.
Yourself and come up with why you're.
There yeah.
In general a general rule that i always.
Is always ask why for everything asking.
Why has helped me in every aspect of.
Life yeah whether like if someone's.
Being mean to you don't don't.
Be sad about it don't cry don't while.
You guess you could cry but you give me.
Sad you can be sad it as well but i'm.
Just so if you ask yourself why when i.
Was getting bullied and i hated it i.
Hated life i had to ask why and that.
Helped me it was like okay what he's.
Doing it because you know he wants to.
Make people laugh why because you know.
Maybe he doesn't at the time wasn't.
Think this but later because that person.
Probably gets enjoyment.
It makes him popular so by thinking that.
Way you find solutions like well okay if.
That's what he wants and that's what i.
Want how can i do that how can i make.
People laugh or how can i you know if.
That's what if that's what he wants then.
I should know it's not about me you know.
I mean that well that's one that's one.
Example but asking why and everything.
Even in in in making youtube videos.
Looking at like other people's videos.
That are doing really well i had to.
Learn from it i don't wasn't always you.
Know successful in youtube it's you just.
Watch videos and see like oh i just.
Posted a video that's a skit ought to be.
Ninja and it did so much better than.
Like the lip syncs and i'm like why does.
Why did this get so much more views you.
Know like i didn't know at the time but.
If you always ask yourself why in every.
Scenario i think it helps everything in.
Life final twitter question is how was.
Your guys's first kiss first chaos to be.
Honest i don't really remember mine damn.
Play a play in the house it's not.
Because i've kissed a lot of girls oh do.

Outside of a movie theater and it was.
Very how old are you 15 or 16 15 but.

Freshman oh another 14 or 15 okay.
Outside a movie theater and it was i'm.
Pretty sure her first kiss or not.
Experienced because i do remember.
Kissing and then trying to use tongue.
And and the weird part was that it was.
So i thought she was.
More experienced because she was the one.
Dislike sticker talking here yes and it.
Was like a little like i didn't know.
What didn't really know what to do to be.
Honest and like i just had there was.
Like this little whirling effect went on.
Like a little tumbling like her tongue.
As i do a little circle thing and then.
By just because i didn't know better i.
Started circling back that tmi or what.

Stereotypical first case like outside of.

Just a peck right and then we like.
Kissed and then we just stayed there and.
Then the tongue came him swirling around.
And then i didn't know but i mean like.
And then i started swirling back that's.
A good first story earth it's not wasn't.
Good but it was it's a good story.
It hasn't happened since so fine.
