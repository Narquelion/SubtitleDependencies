Damn bill i like disgusting right now.
Well still november i can't shave it.
I can't shave it hey guys so as you can.
Tell this is not our normal video.
Because i'm not at my desk and there's.
No bed behind me so actually this is a.
Kind of a tradition are we going through.
Something nice for people all dressed up.
As a ninja.
No no why i started dressing up as a.
Ninja that doesn't really add anything.
To it but it's fun so this year unlike.
The past couple times we did this we are.
Actually not only gonna be giving out.
Food we're gonna be giving out a bunch.
Of blankets and warm clothes and i'm not.
Telling you guys this to make you guys.
Think like oh i'm such a good person or.
Like we're such good people it's.
Actually the opposite i'm actually very.
Selfish if you think about it not doing.
It to help other people i'm doing it to.
Make me feel good so it's incredibly.
Selfish just so happens that this.
Selfish thing that i'm doing has a.
Byproduct that is makes others feel good.
I don't know what i just said anyway i.
Am going to go and be selfish now but.
Being that we have a lot more things to.
Give out this year i might need a little.
Bit of help which as you know only means.
One thing.
