Hey guys sorry i didn't post a video.
Last week if you follow my newly made.
Snapchat you know that i was in hawaii.
For a wedding and no i'm not saying that.
Just to plug my snapchat i hate it when.
People are constantly promoting their.
Own real line so yeah i was in hawaii.
For a wedding i know why i'm so dark.
Right now so i apologize for not posting.
And also i'm sick but anyway today i'm.
Gonna be talking to you guys about.
Having to break bad news to people it's.
Literally one of the hardest things that.
You have to do in life yet it's.
Something that we all have to do i.
Honestly think it's harder to deliver.
Bad news to someone than it is to.
Actually receive it and if you've been.
In that situation you know exactly what.
I'm talking about a king bad news to.
People just sucks it's one of the worst.
Feelings ever this is why i came up with.
This video to not just help you myself.
As well here's some tips and techniques.
To make it a little easier and you guys.
The next time you have to break bad news.
To someone take a look first up we got.
Probably the most common technique that.
People use the good news and bad news.
Technique if you have to deliver bad.
News to people got to give them some.
Good news as well to cheer moms no.
Matter how bad the bad news is there's.
Always good news.
You just have to find it i got some good.
News and bad news.
What do in here first give me the bad.
News well you know how i just left to go.
Get us lattes from starbucks yeah whoa.
In the parking lot i kinda hit a kid.
What are you serious and i fled the.
Scene but they definitely have your.
License plate on file and they're.
Probably on the way here now kidding me.
Right now they're still good news so.
Could there possibly be any good news i.
Got the lattes oh.
Oh yeah that's right they spilled when i.
Hit that kid the bigger picture now.
There's different levels of bad news.
Obviously some are worse than others for.
This technique all you have to do is.
Give fake terrible news right before you.
Give the actual bad news so i comparison.
The actual bad news is not that bad hey.
G yeah they're not making a frozen - oh.
That's x and also i kind of ran over.
Your dog on the way here what oh wait.
Before you get mad they are making a.
Frozen to it are still dead though the.
Cliched technique one of the worst ways.
You can break bad news to someone is by.
Just surprising them with this technique.
You're gonna give them a warning that.
Bad news is coming so that they can.
Mentally prepare for it all you have to.
Do is start your conversation off with a.
Very cliche line such as yeah there's a.
There's no easy way to say this.
I do it to billie and do with the boot.
Indubitably.
In dub it - what does that work.
Indubitably yeah that it means i you.
Know to be without a doubt or for sure i.
Know what it means boo why are you.
Trying to say oh because your.
Girlfriend's cheating on you.
What are you sure indubitably it duped.
And there really is no easy way to say.
That word the good news bad news and.
Even worse news technique sometimes when.
You have really really bad news you.
Don't want to overwhelm the person so.
You're gonna want to break it up into.
Pieces with this technique you give it.
To them in part so instead of giving.
Them extremely awful news you just give.
Them bad news and even worse news like.
We mentioned earlier it doesn't hurt to.
Sprinkle little good news in there.
Wasn't a sprinkle i don't know what that.
Was so i have some good news some bad.
News and some even worse news i wish i'd.
Ear first the good news i guess it the.
Good news is that your son is still.
Alive so oh my god still alive what.
Happened well that's the bad news do you.
Want to know that now or i thought you.
Wanted a good reason right tell me what.
Happened okay well the bad news is your.
Son has been hit by a car in the.
Starbucks parking lot why didn't you.
Tell me that immediately well you asked.
For the good news first not the bad.
Thing he's still alive without even.
Knowing isn't good news you have even.
Heard the even worse news.
How could it be worse well the even.
Worse news is that i lied about the good.
News huh he's dead just have fun with it.
Now if you still can't figure out how to.
Use these techniques i made it even.
Easier asked a bunch of you on twitter.
For some of the worst news that you ever.
Had to break and judging by those tweets.
I came up with some of the most common.
Situations that people find themselves.
In when they have to break bad news here.
Are some pre-made examples that you guys.
Can use when you're in that situation.
Like when grandmas tests come in she got.
Your grandmother's test results back and.
Well she passed so she's going to be.
Okay no but you just said she passed and.
She got an 8 8 plus wait a.
Which passed away the worst news you.
Could possibly break in a wedding and.
You dana do you take gregory to be your.
Husband again and by the power invested.
In me i now pronounce you man and wife.
Let me now kiss the bride wait i have.
Something to say i have terrible news.
There's no easy way to say this so oh.
The wi-fi is down when she refuses to.
Give starwars a chance what are you.
Doing you know how i love star wars and.
I believe in the force yes and ever.
Since we've been married i've been.
Trying to get you to finally watch it so.
Not going to right which is why i.
Believe this belongs to you what is that.
What may divorce be with you you get her.
To break the bad news for you can't just.
Do the same move over and over it's open.
Hey i really am though when it's the.
Highlight of his day.
The park is closed today when you're the.
Boss.
Sir what are you doing i'm gonna light.
This ring around you on fire.
Why cuz i'm firing you what okay.
Obviously these are jokes i took it a.
Little too far you're not gonna light.
Someone on fire this video actually.
Started off kind of realistic and then i.
Had too much fun with it sorry guys but.
Anyways truth is there is no easy way to.
Break bad news to some best way you can.
Do it is by just getting straight to the.
Point don't beat around the bush it's.
Like ripping off a band-aid you just do.
It one time really fast you get it over.
With you also hope that you're not hairy.
Because that hurts marks look i have to.
Get back to work in ten minutes what is.
It it'd be quicker i promise okay well.
Then what's up so i have some bad news.
What is that your newspaper you got wet.
Outside so it's pretty bad news now i'm.
Scared for you for a second i thought it.
You really meant that means well to be.
Honest i actually do have more bad news.
From your neighbors lawns i don't know.
Do you want to give this to them or okay.
Now listen there is something i need to.
Tell you and it's it's pretty upsetting.
I'm betting what is it i just told you.
It's up sitting there kind of slouching.
You really should sit up cuz your back.
It's not good for your back you know.
Okay but anyway the real reason why i.
Called you out here is because well your.
Parents it's it's not looking good and.
My parents what do you mean it's not.
Looking good your parents they they've.
Definitely seen better days.
What happened just your parents it's.
Just a bit messy just tell me what.
Happened what is it you find it's your.
Hair my hair what does this have to do.
With my parents you talking about it.
Your hair is everything to do with your.
Appearance i think it's your ear could.
Also be your posture you're kind of.
Slouching again you went back to doing.
Limited tell you something up sitting.
Again so you remember to you know are.
You kidding me are you serious i mean.
That's two different answers it's no and.
Yes cuz no i'm not kidding you and yes i.
Am serious you are still slouch is this.
Supposed to be funny to you is this.
Supposed to be a joke breaking bad news.
Is not supposed to be funny well i know.
That it's under drama watch it thriller.
Light suspense.
Yeah breaking bad i know it's not a.
Comedy it's not supposed to be funny.
It's like a serious show and you do know.
There's a the show is over right so.
There's no new episodes so it wouldn't.
Be under the new cat.
Don't you get it what where are you.
Going i'm going back to work i'm so over.
This you made me worry for nothing you.
Made it seem like you were going to give.
Me bad news and you did it i mean.
Technically i did give me bad news.
Remember your neighbors bad news -.
Goodbye okay fine.
Gee just just wait okay just i really do.
Have something important to tell you.
Where to god ryan if this is a no it's.
Not it's not okay.

Just made all these jokes because i i.
Just i don't know how to break bad news.
To people and i just hate seeing people.
Get upset especially people actually.
Care about it's part of life ryan.
Everyone has to do it i know i can take.
It you just have to be honest with me.
And stop with the joking around okay.
