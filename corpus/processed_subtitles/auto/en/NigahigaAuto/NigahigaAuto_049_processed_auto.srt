Hey guys so recently i did the ice.
Bucket challenge on my second channel.
Higatv i'm sure all of you know by now.
But for those of you that don't it's a.
Charitable challenge where you either.
Donate $100 to an als charity or you.
Dump a bucket of ice-cold water in your.
Head and you donate $10 instead and.
Basically in my video i did the ice.
Bucket challenge and i donated $100 plus.
Whatever that video earns is going to be.
Going to the als association so if you.
Can't afford to donate the hundred.
Dollars or the ten dollars you can.
Actually just go and view that video and.
Technically i think you'd be donating.
Like a cent or like a fraction of a cent.
Or something but anyway as always people.
In this world love to find the negative.
And everything especially when it.
Becomes popular it happens all the time.
Once something becomes really popular.
People have a tendency to just hated all.
Of a sudden think about it remember when.
Planking first came on and it was like.
The coolest funniest thing you could do.
And then all of a sudden everybody else.
Are you doing it and it became the.
Lamest thing ever or like justin bieber.
When he was a little kid on youtube.
Everyone thought he was like this the.
Most talented cutest little kid ever but.
Once he got signed and made it big he.
Had more haters than anyone now he's.
Kind of generating his own haters.
Because of his actions but initially it.
Wasn't his fault or even like when we.
All used to pee on each other for fun.
And then r.kelly did it and then it was.
No longer cool anymore so that's why we.
Stopped right that's that's why we.
Stopped doing that right basically these.
People love things but a few people know.
About them but once they become popular.
It switches come on what kind of person.
Does that sound like to you get it i'm.
Stirring my hips hipster jokes are oh.
Yeah sorry.
Back to the topic in my mind the ice.
Bucket challenge was and still is a.
Positive thing yet now that it's.
Catching on it's like the worst thing.
You can do right now these people are.
Saying things like people were only.
Doing this for attention now uh yeah.
That's kind of the point to gain.
Attention to raise awareness.
Who cares if they're doing it for.
Attention they're still contributing to.
The viral trend more than you have i'm.
Not gonna lie if i didn't see so many my.
Friends do it and so many of you didn't.
Tag me i would have never known what it.
Was i didn't even know what als was.
Until i heard about this challenge yeah.
So it might be something stupid to do.
But it did bring awareness people who do.
The ice bucket challenge are greedy.
Because they don't want to donate the.
Hundred dollars well first let me ask.
All the people who are saying things.
Like this how much did you donate what.
Have you done for an als charity what.
Have you done for any charity i mean if.
You donated $100 or more you have every.
Right to say that but keep in mind that.
Not everyone who does this challenge is.
As fortunate enough as you to be able to.
Donate that much and.
Sometimes by doing the ice bucket.
Challenge you're actually donating more.
Than $100 because of although awareness.
And attention it brings secondly if one.
Of these videos get a million views.
That's like a tv show commercial do you.
Even know how much those costs i don't.
Know but i'm sure it's at least in the.
Thousands which is a very generous.
Donation people shouldn't be doing this.
Because the ice bucket challenge is a.
Waste of water meanwhile in africa this.
Is probably the biggest and most legit.
Argument that people have with this.
Challenge and yeah i'm not even gonna.
Argue here you do waste water in this.
Challenge but if you're fortunate enough.
To have a computer or have internet.
Access and you're able to watch these.
Videos i'm pretty sure that you've.
Wasted water before and it wasn't even.
For charity i'm like 99% sure that every.
Single person watching this video and.
Myself are able to waste like a little.
Bit of water every single day and we do.
It whether we want to or not but don't.
Pretend like you grew up in a.
Third-world country you've never wasted.
Food water or anything before if you're.
Complaining about wasting a little water.
For charity then you better be peeing.
And pooping in your shower every single.
Night because flushing the toilet waste.
Way more water than the ice bucket.
Challenge and that's not even for.
Charity but ya know wasting water for.
Your comfort is much more important than.
Charity in fact if you're that concerned.
Over water you shouldn't even be.
Showering every single night you should.
Only be showering when you absolutely.
Have to or like if you're really sweaty.
And also you better be getting dirty and.
Sweaty by accident from natural causes.
Because guess what if you're working out.
You're also wasting water.
You're burning unnecessary calories.
Which causes your body heat to rise and.
Because of homeostasis you start to.
Sweat and because of that sweat you get.
Thirsty and because you're thirsty now.
You have to drink water that's your.
Fault so for all you lazy people out.
There that don't work out thank you for.
Saving the planet and also for all the.
People wondering why the ice bucket.
Challenge why did this challenge start.
With ice water instead of just donating.
The sad truth is nobody would have.
Watched let alone share a video of.
Someone just donating and trying to.
Raise awareness by talking about it the.
Ice bucket challenge is when made it.
Shareable i made it a trend i was taking.
Those other challenge videos that people.
Just watch for entertainment purposes.
And making it charitable that's right.
Again for charity nobody got mad about.
The waste of cinnamon for the cinnamon.
Challenge certain world countries need.
Spices too with all that being said to.
Anyone who's actually done the ice.
Bucket challenge and donated despite all.
The negativity you might be getting now.
I still believe this is a wonderful.
Trend and a great cause and thank you so.
Much for doing it and continuing to.
Spread this campaign i still support it.
100% if you're in a place that's in a.
Drought or some days that water is.
Scarce.
I i completely understand your concern.
For saving water but rather than hating.
In the comment section which does.
Nothing but bring negativity why not.
Just find a solution compromise i mean.
They're still.
You can do the challenge without wasting.
Water my friend jeremy lin just did it.
By throwing himself into the ocean and.
If you're still really that concerned.
Over saving a bucket of water i'm going.
To help you out right now by starting.
This new campaign called the save water.
Pee in the shower campaign every single.
Time you have to pee you pee right into.
The drain of your shower but you don't.
Wash it down into the end of the night.
When you take a shower so it all washes.
Together at once that's like three to.
Four flushes a day you'll be saving.
Depending on how much you pee or i.
Suppose you can do it the other way.
Around and pee into a toilet all day and.
Then when you finally flush at the end.
Of the night you just get in there and.
Start watching yourself there's a lot of.
Different solutions rather than.
Spreading negativity or on the ice.
Bucket challenge let's be positive let.
Us find a solution together and keep it.
Growing let us save water together let.
Us spread positivity together let us pee.
In the shower together.
Let us that way we can do both continue.
To raise funds and awareness for als and.
Save water in the grossest way together.
This message brought to you by the save.
Water penis shower association i got it.
What if we combine the two and pee into.
A bucket all day and do the pee bucket.
Challenge and pour it all that is.
Disgusting r.kelly nobody wants to do.
That i mean we're not doing it right.
Beeps man pn n buckets before it was.
