And the laws now are catching it exactly.
This is why bitcoin and crypto and.
Decentralization is the next wave it's.
The most important evolution of the.
Internet and that was how we were able.
To sell out of our bags and then grow it.
To like 10,000 bags 30,000 and 50,000.
100,000 and then grow up to a million.
Clap are we supposed to clap.
Simultaneously no it's just a thing we.
Do welcome back to another episode of.
Off the pill podcast we have a very.
Special edition as you can see.
Everything's very different this is our.
First time being in la where we're gonna.
Be we have another special guests miss.
Michelle phan and we have of course.
David choi at the moderator seat and.
Paco leto right next to me see you're a.
Joke that's why everybody everybody's.
Laughing but yeah we have michelle here.
Thank you for being here on our first.
Episode that's not quite ready yet i oh.
Thank you it's been um it's been a long.
Time for those of you that don't know.
We've actually me you and david have.
Known each other since like i don't know.
A long time ago ten years we're just old.
Youtubers like that's how people see us.
Now i know we're just old youtubers we.
Were at this is this is how dated we are.
We were at the first vidcon.
Put it down there's five thousand was it.
Really just five thousand people no for.
Real haven't vaccin have you been back.
Since i went back a few years ago how.
Was it huh dude it's like a youtube.
Heading zoo that's how i feel stupid.
Yeah well actually considering we were.
Considering of actually going back after.
Ten year because it's their 10-year.
Right 10 year reunion yeah we were.
Talking was already gonna go by himself.
Not with me or anything but david was.
Trying to convince me to go and i think.
You as well i mean are you gonna go i'll.
Go you go you guys have tickets i mean.
This comes out we win is vidcon it.
Should we just go it's been it's a.
Ten-year thing right and then we'll wait.
Another ten years i come back though.
From new york on friday so go on.
Saturday.
What does it start ten which is a.
Tuesday i think oh maybe no wednesday.
Wednesday well okay okay so but we just.
Go in friday then i can't come friday.
Because i come back from new york on.
Friday got it so we would have to go.
Saturday okay i think about it are you.
Really gonna go though for real i'll go.
If you go i don't want to go alone.
Let's go we'll be let's go together yeah.
Guys we're try and see if we can get you.
In this carpool i got i got two spots in.
My car well for people who don't know.
Michelle is an og youtuber it's not.
Don't take that as an insult people.
Refer to me as that as well i'm david.
I'm obviously sniff dog is og he is.
There you go.
And i guess you were i don't know if you.
Were the first but probably the biggest.
Makeup guru right and the for the first.
And biggest makeup guru phoebe i'm sorry.
I keep touching the tea and we're not.
Used to having these mics so i got to.
Stop touching the table hitting it yeah.
The biggest and one of the first makeup.
Gurus on youtube pretty much right and.
Basically i don't know how do you how.
Did you even get started well it was in.
2007 i got rejected from a job a beauty.
Counter i needed a job because i needed.
To pay my bills and i applied and always.
Good but then because i lacked sales.
Experience they didn't hire me that's so.
Ironic well we can get into that because.
You have your own company which is like.
Like hugely successful where's your cup.
It's valued at almost a billion dollars.
Right it's crazy.
Oh yeah if see i left the company two.
Years ago though right but you still.
Built you still started that company.
Initially and that company is like.
Really up worth a billion dollars.
They're doing great they sell three.
Million bags a month for $10 each it's a.
Subscription model so it's very scalable.
And it's helped a lot of indie brands.
Punch and become vegan.
We'll get acquired by the big trifecta.
Beauty brands like procter gamble.
L'oreal how far into youtube did you.
Start that actually it was when i.
Reached a million subscribers and i was.
I don't want to brag though but just to.
Give people some context i was the first.
Woman to have a million subscribers and.
That that milestone i knew okay this is.
A good milestone to think about having.
Longevity because i knew it's the.
Internet people have such a short.
Attention span that i'm not going to.
Last as long my popularity is not gonna.
Last as long so i need another stream of.
Revenue that's not based on my human.
Bandwidth because we made this.
Comparison about how being a youtuber is.
Like being an uber driver and your car.
Is your channel and you have to drive.
Your car if you want to make money and.
With youtube it's the same way where you.
Have to constantly upload and post and.
Even your doing this podcast you got to.
Keep it moving you're an uber driver i.
Know but it's funny cuz didn't you say.
You wanted to come back into it don't.
You miss it i do miss it i don't like.
The politics though cuz within the.
Beauty of space well see you're not in.
The beauty space so you don't really see.
All the drama i know you don't want to.
Be dude there's so much drama in the.
Beauty space beautiful.
Go ahead alright so what do you mean the.
Politics let's get into the rarity get.
Into the drama version or okay call them.
Out nah man i only drink to you i don't.
Spill i have a sense of nobility where.
I'm not that's just not my thing.
Sure it's like karma take care of it you.
Know and also there's always two sides.
To the story.
With everyone and you know most.
Youtubers even the ones who are kind of.
Like a little up a little they.
Don't have the worst intentions it's.
True right they don't and i they're just.
Normal people in a way if people see.
Them as this grand grandiose idol but.
Once the camera turns off they're just a.
Normal person and i i i do actually feel.
Bad for a lot of youtubers and beauty.
Creators who do get pulled into the.
Drama and it has become hollywood or.
Especially within the beauty space.
Because there's so much money in it and.
Where there's money there's.
A lot of people who are going in and who.
Want to be part of this economy i feel.
Like you're tiptoeing around something.
Like is there no i mean in the beauty.
Space you're saying there's a lot of.
Politics like give me an example of what.
That means.
Politics like a lot of these brands will.
Pay - for sponsorships and so if there's.
A product that's not good.
A beauty creator will still say it's.
Good even though everyone knows it's not.
Good i like just selling out yeah.
Selling out so that's one ask well.
You're luckily you don't have to do that.
Right don't but i got lucky.
See i got it early and at that time in.
2008 so this was right when the economy.
Crashed and i was sixteen thousand.
Dollars in debt no one was hiring i.
Didn't know what to do then i saw.
Youtube had adsense and they just rolled.
Out the partners program mm-hmm.
And i figured wait i can make money.
Making these youtube videos that i was.
Doing for free anyways hell yeah i'm.
Gonna do this so you were actually doing.
Before the partner program way before.
Okay what under what time what date did.
You like what year did you actually.
Start.
I started in may 2007 oh wow that's like.
Same as me really yeah.
What june i think or july did all seven.
You're bored too huh yeah just for fun.
That was in hawaii there's nothing to do.
David was actually before david's ogee.
For oh geez what are your two thousand.
Six five right no no no not five 2006.
Dan yeah bro you're late dinah so i have.
I have a joss i have a different account.
That i was posting before david troy.
Leak excuse i'm not gonna announce i.
Know okay well i mean sit like you said.
You want to get back into it i was not.
Just telling you like i just randomly.
And i haven't because you haven't really.
Been posting anything before in the past.
Life in two years yeah so i haven't like.
Clicked on anything on your channel and.
Randomly i just saw recently that your.
Your channel was suggested to me and it.
Was live yeah and i clicked on expecting.
To see you and there was just like this.
Animation and just music playing and is.
That that's what you're gonna be using.
Your channel for more or you're trying.
To do something that's kind of like my.
First it's like when you go to a party.
And you just people who come in early.
They can just enjoy the music.
Got it just setting the tone the.
Atmosphere it's really interesting that.
You're using your channel in that way.
Yeah i mean you have those you know.
Those live streaming channels right yeah.
The music ones i always had them years.
Ago playing in the background and people.
Actually loved watching my videos back.
Then because of my music that i.
Recommended mm-hmm and i have this.
Peer-to-peer marketplace i have this.
Peer-to-peer marketplace called thematic.
Where we help music creators and.
Creators link up and collaborate because.
You know how hard it is to get music.
Rights and takedowns are mm-hmm.
Takedowns happen a lot and with article.
13 and article 17 in the eu it's going.
To become harder and harder and youtube.
Now they're liable or anything copyright.
It and so they don't want to be liable.
For that so we have a lot of these.
Pre-cleared songs from actual music.
Artists for creators to use and so.
That's a company that i founded because.
I was sued years ago by a music label.
And unfairly it was so unfair but it's.
It's not even like there was no one's.
Fault there was a miscommunication along.
The way like i have no hate or mmm-hmm.
Anything towards that music label what.
Happened with that lawsuit oh i just.
Settled it oh right i remember when that.
Was happening i was just like well.
They're gonna i guess i could were kind.
Of big at the time too like that's what.
You're a target yeah because i was.
Always like oh i thought we were safe.
Right cuz i thought were just.
Individuals who had like a big business.
And well this is what happens that not.
Just me but even i'm not gonna say who.
Which youtuber this is cuz i don't know.
If she wants me to say anything but.
She's a big youtuber and she was in the.
Car just saying a lyric from a song just.
Saying it out loud like twinkle twinkle.
Little star and she got claimed to they.
Actually they actually hire people to.
Scour all the top youtubers so it's.
Sickening honestly there's one i one of.
My biggest videos it's called proving.
The illuminati is real and the whole.
Video it got claimed i'm not gonna say.
The lyric because they're gonna claim.
This but in the end card of the video.
What i rhyme with take me sup okay okay.
Something lolo.
Something and i'm probably still gonna.
Get you know you know what song it is.
But i said that in the endcard because i.
Was saying like wake up america right.
Wait.
And then they claim the whole video and.
There's nothing i can do about it and.
That videos nothing to do with that it's.
In the end card of the video i know what.
You mean but that's that's how it is.
That's it but that's why you created.
Sematic yeah but that wasn't even this i.
Wasn't using the song i just said the.
Lyric of it this is the sad part about i.
Mean the whole point of capitalism is.
You're giving people have a chance to.
Build a business to build their capital.
Right they have a great product or they.
Have a great service that they can.
Provide competing against another and.
It's better they can win it's it's that.
Opportunity that america gives to people.
And i feel like when you have these big.
Lobbies whether it's like in the beauty.
Space or in the music space like the.
Ones who own everything they just make.
It so unfair and harder for the smaller.
People to win like they tell us like.
Yeah if you work really hard you have a.
Great idea you're gonna win that's.
You're not unless you have 20.
Lawyers and this is why disney is so.
Well protected even though most of the.
Movies that they create are stolen like.
All of the fairy tales i mean that's.
These are fables that weren't owned by.
Anyone yeah you know what i mean.
I mean i hundred percent understand and.
That really just reminds me of like.
Making this drink has been such it just.
Opened my eyes i thought like okay i'm.
Just sorry i keep picking them out i'm.
Not used to having things that thing on.
The table so i'm making noise so i.
Apologize for the listeners and viewers.
Okay okay but just like getting.
Approvals for things takes so much.
Longer and you don't realize that you.
Have to go through all these different.
I'm just being really careful what i'm.
Saying cuz i don't know i don't want get.
In trouble.
I'm saw a politics politics that's why.
I'm seeing the whole point of the.
Internet yeah was it's it was this way.
For everyone in the world to connect to.
Share ideas you could choose what they.
Want to watch and what they want to get.
Into yeah and the laws now are catching.
It exactly this is why bitcoin and.
Crypto and decentralization is the next.
Wave mm-hmm it's the.
Important evolution of the internet yeah.
You're really i noticed that you're.
Really into crypto and and that you know.
You're very forward-thinking in.
Technology like what what about bitcoin.
Are you like why do you believe in it so.
Much.
Well not everybody understands what it.
Is first off right it kind of boy sure.
Um well that's a big statement it's.
Because there's some so many different.
Components of what bitcoin is but if i.
Were to give an elevator pitch what is.
Bitcoin bitcoin is the the true money.
The truth truest money that we should.
Have had since the beginning of time and.
Just to give some just just to make this.
Easier to digest um why is gold why was.
Gold always considered the standard for.
Money even during like the ancient days.
In egypt mesopotamia why was it always.
Gold because gold one its finite so the.
Fact that you can't find it everywhere.
Two out of all the precious metals it is.
The most stable metal and three it's.
Hard like it takes a lot of energy to.
Mine gold like you can figure out you.
Can even have scanners and scan for gold.
But to pay for the labor to pay for the.
Cost of like the digging and the lit and.
All the people feeding them and just to.
Get a little bit that's why it's so.
Expensive because it takes a lot of.
Energy to mine gold and it's finite so.
Now bringing it to bitcoin bitcoin.
Operates in the same way bitcoin is like.
Digital gold but it's different it's not.
Gold because gold you can carry it.
Intangible but bitcoin it's digital.
Um but the fact that it's a scarce.
Digital asset is what makes it so unique.
How is it scarce.
There's only twenty-one million coins in.
Existence that's it there's never gonna.
Be more coins it's not like our money.
The banks can just print more money.
Right they want to and they do it.
Without our permission not make more.
Bitcoin you can't it is impossible that.
Is it there's only twenty-one million.
Units and we've bitcoin has the white.
Paper started in 2008 satoshi created.
This white paper and no one even knows.
Who suck no she is um it was an.
Anonymous person who came up with this.
Thesis what is bitcoin.
It's essentially a currency that's not.
Built on trust because if you look at.
The back of your dollar it says in god.
We trust telling us trust in this dollar.
It's money it's it's it's a real money.
It's a it's a legal tender but can i go.
Into fort knox to count all the gold no.
But with bitcoin you can you can verify.
Everything everything's time-stamped.
There's verification and so you have a.
Currency that's not built on trust.
Because people don't trust anyone.
Anymore you trust but verify and this is.
What bitcoin brings to the table so um.
Since 2008 we've mined up to i believe.
17 million bitcoin units and six million.
Four million of them are lost meaning.
Four million bitcoin people lost their.
Private keys which means we will never.
See it again.
It's impossible to retrieve it um and so.
That even that drove the scarcity even.
More it's even more scarce when you say.
You mind i'm just because i really don't.
Know i'm not trying to like break it.
Down to me easy you mind a bitcoin what.
Does that entail exactly it entails it's.
Essentially - mine - mine a bitcoin you.
Need to have a computer you could have.
Had a normal computer back then it would.
Have been easier to mine but today you.
Need a lot of computers a lot of energy.
Because it's solving very hard math.
Questions and i think we've just reached.
A halving point which means now it's.
Gonna be even harder to solve these math.
Questions it becomes exponentially.
Harder and they say the last few hundred.
Bitcoins will take several years and the.
Last one will probably probably be mined.
40 2140 will be the last bitcoin.
They say theoretically speaking if we.
Haven't come up with if we haven't.
Advanced into quantum computing yet well.
It will take another hundred years by.
Solving these these math equations.
Though what that's kind of like what are.
You getting from them just a number or.
Like what are you getting exactly what.
Is a bitcoin like if you're solving.
These if you're solving these i'm trying.
To think of something like i'm picturing.
A coin okay actual bitcoin right or what.
They think they're local the cool thing.
About a bit queen is you can buy them in.
Decimals meaning that you can buy them.
In fractions you don't have to buy a.
Whole bitcoin you can buy half of a.
Bitcoin.
One-tenth of a bitcoin it'll called.
Satoshi's by uh satoshi and they say in.
The future so one bitcoin is a hundred.
Thousand satoshis it's like pennies it's.
Like having a hundred pennies equals one.
Dollar so a hundred thousand satoshis.
Equals one bitcoin they say the one.
Satoshi in the future would be worth ten.
Dollars so imagine what a full bitcoin.
Will be worth i mean some have even.
Speculated this is the craziest number a.
Million for one one bitcoin in the.
Future so you're saying there's 21.
Million and that's a cap right that's it.
Right it's finite who decided or is it.
That's how she decided okay so it is a.
Construct of somebody the protocol yes.
Right.
But he's said of intelligent agencies we.
Don't know who's to say that that person.
Right could just be like alright here's.
More you can't it's just impossible.
Because the moment you don't follow the.
Protocol and then bitcoins worthless.
Right well i mean if it does happen then.
Bitcoins worthless but it's not gonna.
Happen because because you have people.
Who verify you have miners who are.
Verifying it who are making sure they're.
Mining it and everyone can verify it.
Like i said it's open-source those.
Ledger's there's timestamps like you.
Can't it's actually impossible right but.
Like like how you said gold is a finite.
Thing right it's something you can hold.
It's there it'll always be there.
Physically and like the the us dollar it.
Has value we all verify has value right.
But it could instantly become worthless.
Right we've given it right week we gave.
It value after around the vietnam war.
When actually it was actually the.
Vietnam war when the dollar went off of.
The gold standard so originally we were.
On the gold standard and became less and.
Less and less and the vietnam war.
Happened and that was when we became off.
The gold standard that was when they.
Started to sign treaties with saudi.
Arabia to back up our dollar by.
Petroleum that's why you have the petro.
Dollar and again politics comes into.
Place in all of this um and the beauty.
With bitcoin is no one owns it like with.
The dollar the federal reserve owns a.
Dollar but if you look at who is the.
Federal reserve it's not the people it's.
Private banks.
Right the bitcoins owned by no one.
Mm-hmm even the banks the banks could.
Buy half of all the bitcoin and that's.
Actually what a lot of them aren't.
Looking into buying because they're.
Realizing wait we can't stop this we.
Should buy some because in the future it.
Might i mean there's theories but some.
People say in the future some countries.
Might even buy a ton of bitcoin and.
Their money is backed up by their.
Bitcoin their bitcoin reserve.
Interesting so you're buying a digital.
Land yeah like you're buying digital.
Real estate you know how real estate is.
Expensive because land is very finite.
Young that's essentially what they coin.
Is but the thing is with real estate and.
Like with gold you can physically like.
That you can't just that won't no one.
Can take that away from you right i mean.
Unless they physically take it away from.
You right with bitcoin i just feel like.
How do you know it could like if you.
Could you show me right now if your.
Bitcoins yeah i mean like i'm trying to.
Say how do you know it's not gonna.
Disappear based on like someone or.
Somebody else in the future well just.
Make sure you have your private keys.
Make sure you have your private keys and.
An offline wallet in cold storage just.
Like you're not gonna have your your.
Gold on your table you're gonna have it.
Buried in the backyard you're gonna have.
It and it is safe you know in a 10 hour.
Fireproof safe but you're not going to.
Take your gold and and like chip off a.
Little bit and go to starbucks really.
Hey can i buy like no they're not gonna.
Do that.
It's bitcoin is not a lot of people.
Think well i'm not am i gonna buy things.
With bitcoin not necessarily there could.
Be future crypto currencies that are.
Backed up by bitcoin but bitcoin is the.
Reserve bitcoin like gold protects your.
Purchasing power when the banks fail if.
You have gold you're still good you can.
Still buy bread if you need to right.
That's that this is how bitcoin helps.
People or something happens to the bank.
Something happens to earn money there's.
A war you still have your private keys.
And you can still protect your.
Purchasing power mm-hmm okay cuz i was.
Just trying to think like bear like.
Technology goes away right like it's.
It's a apocalypse right gold still has.
Value because you can use sure but you.
Know when when technology goes away the.
Last thing we're gonna care about is.
We're gonna try and make fire we're.
Gonna try any exactly gold still has.
Value right because it's a metal because.
It is finite you can melt it.
Examine it yes then we go to the true.
Gold standard but do you see us going.
Away from the digital i'm just saying.
I'm just trying to i'm not saying i'm.
Just going to picture in my head because.
I'm trying to figure out what bitcoin.
Really is i never i always understood it.
I just don't know why they've done tests.
Now i think like an appalled or.
Somewhere else where you can still send.
Bitcoin is someone without fast internet.
Mm-hmm it's just gonna take a longer.
Time but you can still send it without.
The internet wow so how much bitcoin do.
You have is you know like here in.
America or the western world i don't.
Wanna say america but just in their.
Western world the culture is everyone's.
Trying to flaunt through wealth like you.
Want to be on the front cover of forbes.
Like yeah i'm rich well but then that.
Turns you into a target you know.
Interesting is i was reading an article.
About in china a lot of the wealthy.
People in china will pay money to these.
Magazines not just to tell it to put.
Them on the list because they want to.
Protect they want to be low-key about it.
Because they know they're gonna become a.
Target i mean i became a target that's.
All yeah yeah that's what happened.
That's why i've been just staying.
Low-key so the same with bitcoin is.
Don't tell people you're a bitcoin.
Billionaire you know you're gonna.
Attackers coming at you good thing we're.
Broke.
We're so broke i'm no bitcoin i have.
Seven okay sorry i was i didn't mean to.
Stay on that i just like i got it was.
Really trying to figure out what i never.
Knew i never understood it it's.
Fascinating it is it is a little.
Interesting only thing i know about.
Bitcoin is that's why i like graphic.
Cards are getting expensive for.
Computers yeah it's harder to like pay.
For the facebook one i know it's not the.
Same thing but is that it's okay so the.
Facebook libre queen think of it like.
Facebook is an arcade and you go in and.
You exchange your dollar into the.
Quarters and that's what so you can only.
Use it within their ecosystem oh so.
That's different then it's totally.
Different it's not the same it's not a.
Competitor i would i wouldn't even say.
Its competitor it could be one day.
No because bitcoin again it's finite.
What about bitcoins competitors there's.
Other versions yeah but they're not.
Competitors they.
Offer different things util it like.
Their utility coins like aetherium they.
Offer different rings and some of them.
Will say like yeah we're faster than.
Bitcoin we're better but it's like no.
Bitcoin there's a reason why bitcoin is.
At all right now.
Let's see how much it's at i know at one.
Point i think it was at 20 for a while.
They say soon it's gonna go up to 30.
Thousand since are you recommending for.
Us so should we put in the title.
Why michelle phan says to buy bitcoin.
Now and then if they're sell their.
Things go up bitcoin is at eleven.
Thousand eight hundred but it might go.
Down to nine thousand and migrate on a.
Three thousand if it does then you start.
Buying if it goes down to three thousand.
Because that's ridiculous really.
But i tell people don't like stock.
Spaces it's not stocks well it's not but.
It's not stocks like it's not even it's.
Gold isn't a stock gold is a reserve.
Like she really think bitcoin is like.
Gold i think bitcoin is digital gold.
Digital gold real estate because it's.
Finite and it follows a protocol it's.
All about following the protocol and for.
Over ten years it hasn't slipped it.
Hasn't even steered an inch away from.
The protocol it's so when would you i.
Mean like you got in early hmm when.
Would you at what point do you yourself.
Decide i want to sell it okay so there's.
Different so you know i'm gonna have to.
Sell it you could buy a house with.
Bitcoin i've seen a video and you know.
The cool thing is you don't have to deal.
With taxes or anything cuz it's at.
Illegal no one that's legal like no one.
Owns it's not government regulated i see.
It's not and in a way we have the.
Internet we should have had a money that.
Went we should have had a currency that.
Went with the internet but we have in.
Everything's been tied to banks like.
Doing it so i was reading about how.
There is 400 million dollars a bitcoin.
That was moved.
Guess how much the transaction fee was.
Four hundred million dollars just guess.
Wow yeah with two dollars yeah exactly -.
I'm a genius i know about bitcoin but.
You know in zimbabwe they have a crazy.
Currency out there like i think they.
Have a note that's 100 trillion dollars.
They have one note that's a hundred.
Trillion guess how much it's worth in.
U.s.
I have no idea two dollars forty cents.
But locally i think two days ago locally.
In zimbabwe bitcoin was at seventy two.
Thousand dollars locally oh really yeah.
That's crazy it dude like this is just.
The beginning everyone so slept on it.
I've been telling people for years.
Bitcoin it's the future.
Well the hype sure died down because it.
Was at like 20-something when everybody.
Was buying yeah right and i thought well.
When it's down that's when you buy you.
Guys warren buffett did with stocks.
Yeah but warren buffett said um bitcoin.
Is rat poison and now he's kind of.
Eating his words and he's talking to.
Crypto people oh really.
Yeah interesting okay well that went.
Down around i did not know i'm just like.
Alright well how do we do this though.
Like negative things around it though.
Like i mean whether it's true or not.
Well so was youtube in the beginning.
Well you can make money on youtube.
That's so dumb yeah and the content -.
They're talking about some parts you.
Can't argue there was a lot of dumb.
Stuff they're still dumb stuff but it.
Makes money there's people watch tv yeah.
That's true - yeah well i'm talking like.
Current youtube dumb stuff oh yeah.
Clickbait oh yeah everyone's there was.
Pick me before - though that's true but.
I feel like now algorithm on youtube has.
Become like a up god everyone's.
Trying to please and everyone's trying.
To chase after and get and understand.
And they're trying to optimize their.
Content to favor the algorithm there's.
Literal groups of youtubers i'm not.
Gonna say who but there's groups that.
Talk about this and this they tell each.
Other do you know about this anyone.
There's a there's a discord channel it.
Will analyze the algorithm like on a.
Daily basis it's pretty pretty intense.
To get oh can you send me that channel.
Yeah i just like to read it yep it's.
Interesting it is interesting but it i.
It's hard to keep up with the changes i.
Would say that it never ends yeah never.
Ends they don't have to tell us either.
You know so.
Yeah right 30 minute mark okay i guess.
We'll take a quick cheesy break a ninja.
Melt break ninja milk energy made with.
Organic milk and flavors she's such a.
Nice voice lightly carbonated energy.
Drink no artificial sweeteners or.
Preservatives and it tastes amazing let.
Me try let me try anyway try this all.
Right.
Lightly carbonated oh my all right quick.
She she break and we'll be right back.
Music.
And we're back.
Music.
Hey david's rusty he hasn't been.
Moderating in a while actually i don't.
Think he's ever done this really yeah.
We're still learning sorry michelle.
We're getting back into it a little bit.
But getting away from krypto actually is.
That so talking about krypto we were.
Just talking about your other company m.
Cosmetics right it's awesome that's a.
Second one did you why yes i did i.
Completely engineered the opening sound.
To sound delicious and fresh we're just.
Talking about this off camera because.
Thanks because um i i didn't do that but.
You asked me that and you said i should.
Tell more people that see ryan says i.
Can't lie to people and i said marketing.
Isn't lying or just exaggerating okay.
But i didn't invent that sound sound.
That's just science things were actually.
People who engineer sounds like that.
Like the snapple bottle that yes okay.
That is satisfying yeah but i am yeah i.
Made that i made it up what we were.
Talking about were just talking about i.
Distract em cosmetics i have and look.
This isn't sponsored or anything david.
Wanted to bring this up because he.
Stopped by my office interesting story.
Few months ago.
And he was asking like yeah so what's up.
With this em cosmetics thing how how did.
This come about mmm.
So to give you some perspective most.
People who start a beauty brand they.
Start it they boot strap it they you.
Know you have a startup so you.
Understand like you put your own money.
Into it and you grow it and then if you.
Get around like a million to five.
Million a year pretty good but when you.
Get up to around 10 to 20 million up to.
Like 50 million this is when bigger.
Brands like the estee lauder the l'oreal.
The procter & gamble they want to they.
Are interested in acquiring your brand.
So they want to acquire it and then they.
Take your existing company in your brand.
And then they just power through and.
Turn it into a billion-dollar company so.
They buy you out and that's normally the.
Lifecycle for value meaning like you.
Don't have any part of it once it.
Becomes a billion-dollar company no it.
Doesn't become a billion-dollar company.
They buy you at 50 million so they turn.
It into a billion-dollar company okay so.
With em we did the exact opposite my.
Brand was actually created with l'oreal.
And this was the first time in 2011.
L'oreal has ever created a brand from.
The ground up normally they acquire.
Brand that's what they're really good at.
They acquire the brands and they grow it.
Into a big business like nyx urban decay.
It cosmetics and in my case with em.
They're like hey michele she's doing.
This really cool thing on youtube let's.
Take a gamble and let's create a beauty.
Brand with her and granted l'oreal is a.
Great they're masters when it comes to.
Marketing creating beauty products.
Expanding on that but creating a brand.
From the start you know from the ground.
Up it's hard it is hard because you need.
To have you you can't take a corporate.
Structure and then bring it into the.
Startup world it's really hard to do.
That because you have to oftentimes a.
Lot of the corporate structures there's.
So many layers and bureaucracies and to.
Get one thing approved you have to go.
Through 15 different people on a startup.
You just talk to three people and that's.
It it's instant umm and so what's.
Interesting was when i was developing.
The brand with l'oreal and this was in.
2011 i was also building it c at the.
Same time so in new york i'm building.
Mcas medics with l'oreal and i fly back.
To la san francisco and.
Building obscene doing the two and it's.
It was interesting seeing the dichotomy.
Between the two worlds because on the.
Loreal side they here they had a lot of.
Budget and a lot of people a lot of.
Bodies in the company building the brand.
With me but because we had too many.
People involved things became very.
Convoluted my vision became convoluted.
Along with it um but then on the other.
Side of the spectrum we had it see where.
We only had two point seven million.
Dollars seed funding and that was it and.
We were able to use that money and.
Stretch it and go go completely.
Grassroots like our marketing was.
Through youtube we would just talk.
Directly to these brands and that was.
How we were able to sell out of our bags.
And then grow it to like ten thousand.
Bags thirty thousand fifty thousand a.
Hundred thousand and then grew up up to.
A million and then when we launched em.
Cosmetics in 2013 with l'oreal it.
Flopped it's completely flopped people.
Were hating on the brand because they.
Said the packaging looked so cheap.
The praat like it was too expensive it.
Didn't look like me and i was getting so.
Much hate even though i had no control.
Over anything.
I really didn't because it really was.
Not like your branding then it wasn't no.
Boss.
When people saw when people watch my.
Videos i'm known for a certain aesthetic.
And they were so confused when they saw.
Em by l'oreal because it wasn't it was.
Completely off of my aesthetic um it was.
An authentic it was not authentic no so.
I got a lot of hate and it really sucked.
Because i couldn't say anything.
You know i'm under certain contract so.
I'm like you know nda's and all of that.
Long story short i was stuck and but.
Thankfully i had epsy that was draining.
Really well so in a way that was kind of.
My savings my saving grace like that.
Saved my face like i wasn't seen as a.
Failure because even though the.
Cosmetics l'oreal flopped if she was.
Here zip see like doing two million bags.
Doing really well and we only needed 2.7.
Million dollars and we never need it to.
Raise sense right um so really shows you.
It's not about like legacy companies.
Like these big companies like you know.
Google when google started google+ they.
Thought oh we can take down facebook or.
Facebook is like let's take down tik-tok.
And launch last so like now dude like.
Innovation comes from small startups.
It's always been like that that's where.
You really truly see it because you.
People who are very passionate and again.
You don't have so many different layers.
Of people you have to go through to.
Approve one thing and if c is a great.
Testament of that so going back to 2015.
We raise 100 million dollars for epsy.
Were able to use that money to buy em.
From l'oreal and to acquire it under.
Ipsy which was great but again it wasn't.
My brand it was oopsies so i couldn't.
Approve everything of course even though.
I am a founder of ipsy i have shares in.
It there's still a lot of politics when.
You do raise money for a company you.
Give up some some control um and it got.
To a point where i just became so tired.
I just wanted something that was mine i.
Was ready to also be independent and so.
Two years ago i left obscene and i.
Bought my brand back and so m now is.
Completely owned by me and that's.
Awesome and it's just been incredible.
Because we're small but it feels like a.
Family unit well when you say small it's.
A guessing comparison to the other.
Things we've seen your office it's not.
Oh yeah.
It's sick it's not small but i guess it.
Come in compared to what you i mean.
Compared to having 200 employees now.
Having like twelve it is really small.
But we are forced to be reckoned with.
Because we everyone can wear multiple.
Hats like this i thrive in smaller.
Environments i can't do a corporate.
Companies i just can't it's just i think.
It's it's so opposite of even who we are.
Yeah right like you probably get more.
Work done if you were to just work with.
You and a few of your friends and if you.
Were thrown into like an office right.
Yeah you have a hundred people and.
Everyone just focus on one job rather.
Than collaborating it becomes super.
Hyper specialist and you.
Compartmentalize it's like oh so-and-so.
Does that to refer to them rather than.
Owning it together you're owning the.
Project together then because if it's.
All you know individuals it always ends.
Up being like alright i'm just gonna do.
My job pass it off if they're not doing.
Their job that i don't care i'm doing my.
Thing.
Exactly yeah that's that's tough well in.
Trying i got a question so you know.
You're very successful entrepreneur.
Obviously and you've built large.
Companies.
What are like the top three things are.
Or there's the top things that you you.
Think are required for people out there.
Who are trying to start something like.
You did like what are some of these.
Things that you feel like can help build.
A massive business like you have a.
Billion-dollar billion-dollar business.
How do you make a billion-dollar.
Business.
Well okay evaluation let's rephrase that.
What does it even mean to be worth a.
Billion dollars because you look at.
Netflix and they're worth a billion.
Dollars but they haven't profited yet.
Gee um you look at even amazon i think.
Even amazon is still in a deficit or.
Something they started to make more.
Money weirdly enough with amazon web.
Service so for the longest time.
Amazon wasn't profiting really yeah they.
Weren't profiting freely years years.
Years and i don't know which year it was.
At 2015 or fourteen i forgot which year.
But bezos because so many people were.
Using amazon they needed the best.
Servers they needed private servers and.
All that he decided okay let's let's do.
Redundancy servers where we build more.
Servers because if one server shuts down.
Amazon can still run in like colorado.
Because we have the servers there so.
They did redundancy and it took a whole.
Year to build several several different.
Servers all across the nation for farms.
Server farms okay and when he went to.
The board and he was talented oh no he.
Didn't go to the board yet he had the.
Engineers come to him and say okay we.
Finished everything and he was curious.
He asked um how much is amazon using of.
All these servers no like oh just like.
Six or twelve percent like very little.
And he had an aha moment he went to the.
Board he said hey let's create a.
Subscription amazon web servers because.
We're only using a very small amount and.
We have all this excess and we can make.
Money with just servers if you think.
About it it's like genius because you're.
Not selling product you're not storing.
Anything you don't have to ship anything.
It's just a subscription it's just data.
Yeah.
And that helped them make tremendous.
Money and so now when you opt in to.
Amazon web servers it's so impressive.
Because you can get like you can have.
Like machine learning involved in there.
I mean it's crazy like it's not just a.
Normal it's not a basic setup like it's.
Very very robust and impressive so again.
Like going back to the valuation having.
A billion dollars that's like height.
That's like saying oh yeah my company is.
Worth a billion but.
Doesn't necessarily mean you're making a.
Billion dollars that's what the.
Investors who invested in your company.
Are projecting for you to be worth and.
To make something sense know so a lot of.
A lot of these companies who raise like.
80 million dollars and they still don't.
Profit yet but then their investors will.
Be like yeah they're worth like a.
Billion dollars they can go out and say.
That so it's kind of hype um thankfully.
With ipsy we were so anti hype we were.
Actually doing really well because we.
Were subscription people were paying $10.
A month and three million bags are being.
Sold um but we weren't like we weren't.
Relying on that hype of being worth a.
Billion dollars so to go back to.
Everything i don't think i think if you.
Have the intention to build a billion.
Billion dollar company you don't have.
The right intention in place you your.
Goal is mislead by numbers and what ends.
Up happening is if you don't meet these.
Numbers and these milestones oftentimes.
You can lose sight of yourself and you.
Can burn out really fast and i always.
Tell people and potential business.
Owners and entrepreneurs don't set goals.
Set intentions first i think when i.
Started my youtube channel there was no.
Money in it because there is no adsense.
Right but my intention was to teach i.
Wanted to share i want to teach when i.
Started epsy i wasn't i didn't have any.
Idea would become such a big thing but.
My intention was i have this great.
Product idea and i want to help people.
With it i think that's really important.
So intention set intentions and the.
Second thing is look for a market gap.
That's really important too because you.
Can have a really good product idea or.
Service but if it's too early on then.
You miss out on that boat so you have to.
Be you have to know when to be ready to.
Launch it oftentimes so many people have.
Great ideas but it's too early or it's.
Too late so learn and observe the.
Different market gaps that you have and.
Market gaps so to bring it to bring this.
Into like i was like to like bring it.
Into my context because my viewers might.
Understand in 2007 there were no makeup.
Tutorials people if people wanted to.
Learn makeup videos they would either.
Have to go to a beauty counter and buy.
Products or pay for beauty seminars or.
Read books and there is never something.
Where they can just sit at home and.
Watch for free and rewind.
Fast-forward skip and have someone.
Relatable speaking to them so that's a.
Market gap market gap is wait no one's.
Making these videos i'm gonna make them.
So identify these market gaps in the.
Market i would that's one of the first.
Things you would say to like yeah set.
The intention finding the market gap and.
I guess my third one top tips.
Those are good tips and i think it is.
Important most people don't know when.
They hear like oh the evaluation is a.
Billion dollars they don't know you're.
Not making a billion making like.
Snapchat for one there were another one.
Right that wasn't making dairy i don't.
Know what their what are they worth well.
Their ipo right note there they're a.
Public company right now but i think for.
A long time they were making zero.
Dollars no money at all but they were.
Like the biggest thing in the world.
Because they had active users they had.
Millions of active users and so the idea.
Is like everyone wants to find the next.
Facebook but for me it's like it's over.
Because all facebook needs to do is just.
Copy it which is totally what i did yeah.
Yeah and there's no shame in that like.
As in they don't see shame in that.
Because they have to look out for their.
Business and that's just how a cutthroat.
It is china copies it too you know like.
Everyone's just copying each other and.
That's why i always tell people don't.
Try and like create something that.
Facebook can easily copy like look at.
The future market gap if we are going.
Towards this decentralized market place.
Where money will even become.
Decentralized build towards that that's.
Gonna start happening in the next 10.
Years you want to build towards the.
Future if you want to build something.
That you can sell fast and now then yeah.
Sure like build something that's.
Hyperbole and then try and find an exit.
Fast as you can but oftentimes when you.
Don't find an exit you're stuck you're.
Like a hamster in a wheel and you're.
Stuck and you're in this very old old.
Company that makes sense okay good.
Advice yeah that is good advice actually.
I'm sure some people there's probably a.
Lot of people who are like i'm gonna get.
Bitcoin i'm gonna start my own company.
What do people need right now so i don't.
Know i think it's there you go.
Ninja my energy not paid for yeah i.
Didn't tell her to do this she just has.
A voice that's worth a lot of money no.
Well two bitcoins i don't i don't that's.
A lot.
We just learned there's a finite amount.
Do we still have the i know we didn't.
Print them out the questions and stuff.
Do we have some stuff yeah it was super.
Sorry and thanks for coming it was super.
Last-minute dude literally david deems.
Me yesterday that's where we talk hey.
You guys dm you we do see you a long.
Time ago on you had a different number.
That time are you always changing your.
Number why is that dude i have some.
Crazy people man for real yeah let me.
Talk about that yeah let's talk about.
These crazy did the crazies there there.
Is this one guy who came into my office.
And my team they're like uh do you have.
An appointment with someone here and.
He's like where's michelle and he was.
Like scratching himself right what was.
Like he's like he was just like i got.
Cracks machete i don't know yeah.
No i don't know like and and my business.
Partner just sent me a picture cuz we.
Have security cameras are you wearing.
He's like hey do you know this guy i'm.
Like no i don't know him right like oh.
So i'm one of them.
One of my co-workers i can't hook him.
And like sent him really far away like.
Physically yeah like walked him escorted.
Him off the property.
And i think like it was like a few days.
Later i was in had instagram stories i.
Was going to one of my friends show he's.
He he was djing at this show and i was.
Gonna go and support so i when i arrived.
With my other friend i hear this guy.
He's like michelle so your first.
Instinct when you hear your name is turn.
Around right so i turned around and i.
Remember him from the picture i'm like.
Oh i shouldn't same guy right and he's.
Like michelle michelle but thankfully my.
Friend was there was just blocking him.
Like totally blocking it like hey that's.
Not michelle i don't know you're talking.
About and they quickly like let me into.
The venue and they blocked him and the.
Security guard was saying yeah this guy.
Showed up like he was here like six.
Hours early and when you went in he.
Started banging his head against the.
Wall i was like dude this is crazy cuz.
I've been on hiatus for so long you know.
Like it would make sense.
Like you're active i was active and also.
I mean not to like you know not not to.
Like shun anything or anything but it.
Was more promiscuous to like if i'm.
Showing more promiscuous photos of.
Myself okay that makes more sense but.
You know like ii go on my instagram feed.
It's just my cat and me and like anime.
Pictures and i'm so about even pictures.
Of you yeah dude this is crazy so i.
Can't even imagine other people who have.
A following built on you know their.
Sexuality and all of that but yeah dude.
There's like crazy people.
I'm sure he's not crazy but you just.
Don't do that yeah i mean at that point.
That's not even like a hardcore fan.
That's like even fans i think having of.
Awareness to not show up and i don't.
Know i don't know if you added in the.
Whole scratching thing on purpose but.
That sounds i could i don't know i could.
Be wrong i'm just judging right now no.
Idea this guy's like you just you just.
Don't do that like have some just have.
Some respect for people's spaces and i.
And i feel like a lot of a lot of.
Viewers they they almost feel entitled.
When they see online personalities like.
Oh i know them because they're my best.
Friend.
And so they've i've heard horror stories.
Of youtubers where they would have.
People like outside their block like.
Taking pictures of their house because.
They saw maybe on their gps like where.
They were going right that's why i moved.
And it still happens yeah i moved.
Because i was not in a gated community.
And i have camera i still have footage.
Of people like kids coming to my house.
And like taking pictures like through.
The windows and stuff obviously i was.
Already paranoid by then so all the.
Things they could never see me but yeah.
There's that happens all the time i mean.
David had scarier story like your story.
About your stalker dude yeah you and.
Kina and kina we had a his mascara.
Shared stalker why don't you share that.
Story you never talked about that sure.
I'm pretty sure he's not watching but he.
Might be go ahead.
But yeah so kina and i had this one.
Stalker on twitter and he would put out.
These like really mysterious like the.
Deaths the day of death shall come upon.
Keen like you tagged kina and i and you.
Just like come up with a lot of these.
Like creepy cryptic kind of.
Suja's and i just didn't really think.
Too much of it i was like oh this is.
Whatever i don't even know where this.
Guy is or who this guy is.
So eventually kena and i we both went on.
Tours separate separate tours but at the.
Same time we were both on tour she plays.
At this venue in florida and i was gonna.
Play at the same venue two weeks later.
So two weeks later hums by and i i roll.
Up you know with my gear and everything.
And you know my crew and they were the.
Crew there they were they were like hey.
David we heard that there's a stocker.
Guy and you know we have a picture of.
Him and we just wanted to let you know.
That we are we know what's going on and.
We'll keep an eye out for anything weird.
Or sketchy that may happen okay cool.
Awesome i'm in my green room getting.
Ready for the show guy a security guard.
Comes in he's like david he's like the.
Guy showed up i was like what no way and.
They were like yeah he came in he had a.
Fake id.
He he he saw before before the tour.
Actually kinas shared me a web site like.
And he had a mug shot he had like a.
Little mustache so he when he came to.
The show he actually shaved off his.
Mustache and he showed up and the great.
Thing is he bought a t-shirt in a cd and.
Then they saw him and they caught him i.
Mean i'm glad they did after he bought.
The t-shirt and i would have signed it.
For him too so but he had a mug shot.
Yeah so yeah and then and then they were.
Like they escorted him out and that's it.
Yeah i was like did you guys not call.
The police or anything yeah they're like.
I mean he didn't have anything wrong so.
We just identified him we escorted him.
Out and then that's all we could do just.
Not let him back in it was still kind of.
Scary because he could have waited a.
Block away with a gun and he could have.
Shot me with that that's why when the.
Whole christine.
Machining grimmy that really affected me.
A lot i stopped doing show not just for.
That reason but some of the main reasons.
I stopped doing i don't travel anymore i.
Don't do those kind of shows because i.
Don't know i just that that situation.
Really like haunted me you know because.
It could it's if you think about it it's.
Really easy to do like the security is.
There but it's like it's not hard to get.
Things past people right it's not like.
We're going through actually i don't.
Know how like ariana grande tours are.
Like they have metal detectors and stuff.
But for our shows it was never like that.
Crazy but it has to be now right yeah so.
Anyway that's just i thought it was.
Interesting because you brought up.
Something soccer related yeah no dude i.
Mean i think i think i do i feel like.
Some people they fantasize about having.
A stalker you know what i mean like oh i.
Want a stalker.
I think you think like people want to.
Stock quarterly fifty shades of grey if.
I haven't seen it either but like i've.
Read the wiki of it but i'm pretty sure.
Of that christian grey guy or whatever.
His name is if he was a broke-ass guy.
Like yeah it would not be a romantic.
Story but the fact that he's a ceo and.
Super rich people fantasize that like.
Yeah he's a stalker it's so hard like no.
That is not yeah i think you should not.
Romanticize whatever you what if your.
Stalker guy that show up to your office.
He was like gorgeous like just the.
Best-looking dude looks clean his.
Business suit you just i need to see.
Michelle i need to see a show and even.
His voice is just like do you fake real.
Buzz would you have still send it okay.
Thank you would you still have sent him.
Away.
Because it looks matter in that case.
Because you're not gonna judge him in.
The same way right even your co-workers.
You're right looks do you matter.
Yeah if you don't have business with me.
But even if he sure i've been a nice.
Burberry i was trying to go my expensive.
Brand i don't know burberry suit that's.
An expensive one i feel like that would.
Just be plaid like he's also came up.
Okay but that's it happen and that was.
Your stalker and you saw him in another.
Event and he showed up it's a little.
Weird but it's like this gorgeous dude.
Expensive suit would you still have sent.
Him away that's my question or would you.
Have given him the benefit of the doubt.
And had a little talk with him.
Would have seen just what is your.
Business here oh really yeah the most.
Gorgeous person even if the most.
Gorgeous persons like money man i got it.
And speaking of time we're about to wrap.
Up but we want to get one twitter.
Questioning with you at least and since.
I've said three lines this whole podcast.
I figure i should pitch it to you.
Go for it somebody asked so michelle.
What's next that's your question she.
Talked a lot about what what was in the.
Past sure yeah so you know we kind of.
Want to see cuz you know you're like you.
Said your channel is like you're.
Starting to use it now there's music.
Coming on so and you're like you said.
You and made an analogy where it's kind.
Of like the beginning of a party people.
Come to it you know so the party is.
Starting up so you know how are you.
Kicking off this party in and out truck.
Coming in ten minutes i don't know i'm.
