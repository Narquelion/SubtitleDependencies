And i just what obviously wasn't.
Expecting it so i just fell to the.
Ground and i was like wearing a dress i.
Don't know what it is about dance but.
Women just love it it is attractive it.
Is just a cow like right there at the.
Window cuz they just broke free are we.
Good we're good to go alright welcome.
Back to another episode off uh oh i.
Didn't i messed up sorry welcome back to.
Another episode of off the pill podcast.
Oh it's the wrong song i guess we'll go.
With that we're struggling today we have.
A special guest miss bethany mota in the.
House and of course as always we have.
David the moderator seat baby the.
Moderator see he's about to get replaced.
As we have all the leto right next to us.
Applause.
So we are like i said we were here with.
Beth and thank you for being here we.
Didn't know were so close yeah we were.
What were you just talking about before.
We started rolling we were doing time oh.
Something we're talking about the room.
That dietrich's made for him all right.
So just to preface that how did you.
Bring that up well let's let's have a.
Little bit of a introduction you know.
Something for some of the audience that.
Doesn't know who you are me true so who.
Are you i.
Wow introduction here we go um i am.
Bethany mota i am a youtuber i've been.
Making videos for gosh like sometimes.
Annoying yeah like ten years now wow and.
I do other things like music and.
Designing and just a lot of different.
Things and mainly i just do social media.
Stuff so you brought in over ten million.
Subscribers yeah no so that's very early.
News almost a billion views yeah.
Are you um still working you were.
Working with not abercrombie just arrow.
Pasto are you are you still working with.
Them or no no ended.
And i think like 2015 okay but it was.
Like a few years and really really cool.
It just i felt very out of place because.
I was suddenly thrown in with all of.
These like legit fashion designers to.
Like help me put this collection.
Together and i did well though it did.
Really well it did better than i could.
Have ever expected but yeah it was.
Definitely like crazy that i was like 18.
At the time 2050 that's when i met you i.
Think right in japan we met in japan.
Yeah i was around that time i think even.
Later no i think it was way before that.
Oh really i think it was like it was a.
While ago twelve or something mm-hmm oh.
Wow yeah how old were you at the time at.
Sixteen okay that would mean sense yeah.
We got you to eat squid ink remember we.
Heard you're really picky i still.
Remember that yeah terrified i know it.
Wasn't that bad though you didn't like.
It.
It was pretty bad how did the arab.
Hostel like think umm about him kind of.
Interested in how that kind of came.
About did they just reach out to you.
Randomly or i well it started with just.
Like a casual meeting like i didn't.
Think anything was really gonna come of.
It and we basically just did a few meet.
And greets like in new york and they.
Were like whoa we want to work with you.
More so i basically like picked a few.
Items from their existing line and like.
Put that out as like these are my top.
Picks and then those kind of all sold.
Out and then they decided they want to.
Do like a full on like partnership so i.
Launched the bethany mota clothing brand.
Under them and so i was in all of their.
Stores and online and it was really.
Successful it was just really fun also.
To like actually design and have.
Something out there that everybody was.
Like could actually have and wear and.
Yeah it was a crazy experience.
You're 16 i think i've never been 17 or.
18 when that happened that's crazy.
That's still pretty young good you're.
Working with a bunch of adults yeah.
That's what's crazy too is like because.
I'm older now i mean i'm still young but.
It's like i'm more aware of what was.
Actually happening i feel like because.
It all happened so.
And because i got into it so young i.
Didn't really know what was going on.
Almost like not to say i didn't.
Appreciate it but kind of kind of like i.
Just was so unaware of like how like.
One-of-a-kind that was because it was.
Deal that was right that was a pretty.
Big deal right especially at the time.
For youtubers that wasn't like you.
Really one of the first to get a major.
That's a major brand like it's a i think.
Right yeah no absolutely not no we don't.
Have that in hawaii though i think in a.
While but when i heard about i was like.
Oh i've heard of that before and then.
Like that's a major brannen for.
Youtubers back then we weren't getting.
Those kind of deals now maybe yeah back.
Then it was a big deal but are you still.
So you're not working with them anymore.
But are you still doing you're still.
Doing fashions related things right uh.
Not like developing clothing i mean it's.
Something that i definitely want to do.
More in the future but i think it'd just.
Be much different than it was back then.
Because i was also obviously a lot.
Younger so i think anything i put out.
Now is just gonna be like a little older.
But i haven't been designing i've just.
Been like like i still do fashion.
Related content but just not like.
Designing clothes that's your main focus.
To look back to making more videos.
Because you did take a look a break for.
A bit right yeah i took like i feel like.
I took a lot of little breaks and then i.
Took a pretty big break most recently.
And i think it's just like it started.
Probably end of 2014 when i was kinda.
Just like i am so burnt out on this.
Thing because i was going hard for years.
And i honestly had no social life like i.
Didn't have any friends i was also.
Homeschooled when i started making.
Videos so getting into it when i first.
Started first couple years it was like.
Three videos a week wow and no one on my.
Team so it's just me filming editing.
Everything and i didn't socialize so my.
Question is if you're a homeschooled how.
Did you like come across youtube and.
Knowing that you could make videos and.
Stuff like that.
It was actually because i was.
Home-schooled that i feel like i was.
More aware of it because i was home all.
The time and so it was like always.
Online and then i stumbled across it i.
Feel like actually if i was in public.
School at the time i probably wouldn't.
Have cared as much about it and.
Definitely wouldn't have made videos i.
Think was just because i was just bored.
And so i started watching them and then.
Decide to make them also being so shy.
Growing up i think if i was in public.
School there's no way i would have even.
Started a channel but it was because i.
Felt like i was kind of like hiding in a.
Way and then this is like me being able.
To talk to the world from like my own.
Room that's true i feel like back in the.
Day especially like i don't know if this.
Is true or not but i feel like a lot of.
The older youtubers people who start a.
Long time ago or more like shy and.
Introverted people who fall in the space.
To express themselves and it's kind of.
Changed to like the opposite yeah i.
Noticed that i think there back then.
There was a lot of it was mostly i think.
Introverted right people that felt like.
This was kind of their only outlet to.
Actually express themselves in ways that.
They would never do in front of people.
Right and then now it's uh i mean i.
Don't want to say it but it sounds like.
It was like like the losers the loser.
Kids who are kind of on it and it kind.
Of made it big and then now the cool.
Kids are here you know like the logan.
Paul is like tall buff looking.
Good-looking dudes and like you know we.
Weren't that back so we found a space.
Where we were like safe but now the cool.
Kids took over do you feel like it kind.
Of helped your person like help develop.
Your personality oh absolutely.
Like even comparing ben to now my first.
Video i was so awkward i mean i'm still.
Awkward but back then it was so bad like.
I was whispering in the video because i.
Didn't want anyone to hear me talk like.
In my house and then i also was wearing.
Glasses back then because i was too.
Afraid to wear contacts so every video.
I'd have to like take my glasses off and.
Just be like school win team just so i.
Could look in the viewfinder and like.
See what was going on so awkward and so.
Scared but don't you think that's what.
Made you loveable though like to the.
People who really like loved you they're.
Like oh my god i relate she saw quick i.
Think that's like why we watch people.
Like we watched certain people that we.
Kind of.
Yourselves in so i feel like a lot of.
Girls that were my age could relate to.
So much of what was going on with me.
Back then cuz i was just really trying.
To figure it out kind of all over the.
Place.
Well what's getting back to the just.
Because i brought it up earlier but.
Didn't continue about the story that you.
Were telling us about oh yeah that dom.
So you're dating d-trix it's not a.
Secret right it's very public i lived.
With d-trix for a long time and now he's.
Actually the reason why i moved out to.
La for like a few years but uh yeah so.
Dom dietrich's is currently what she was.
He on so you think you can dance.
They think you dance so he was gonna be.
Here but he will be here another time he.
Said well i don't know how that story.
Came basically the night that you had.
Your ninja milk release party dom held a.
Small little get-together like a.
Barbecue at his house and so like a lot.
Of the rhpc guys went and we kind of.
Like hanging out he showed us around and.
Then he was like hey you guys want to.
See this this room i made for beth and.
We made a room he made a room yeah yeah.
What was the occasion well let you take.
It away cuz you know this best.
So basically dom made a room for me it.
Was for christmas because we have this.
Rule with like any gifts that we give.
Whether it's like birthday or christmas.
That we have to make them and it can't.
Be like store-bought so i made him like.
This light-up sign and i like used power.
Tools for the first time i was really.
Proud of myself but he made me this room.
That was basically he recreated my.
Childhood room and so he did all this.
Research apparently like looking at what.
My room looked like and like watched all.
My old videos when i had like hot pink.
Walls so he painted this wall hot pink.
And then created this like stitch mural.
Cuz lilo and stitch is like my favorite.
Disney movie and then he had these.
Pictures of me i like walk in and the.
First thing i see are these letters at.
The top of the window that just say.
Little beth and then there's like all of.
These pictures of me as a baby but he.
Photoshopped himself into them so it's.
Like a little.
Babies together agreed that it is creepy.
Like it is i thought is there though.
Totally i was honestly in tears cuz i.
Was like this is the most thoughtful.
Thing anyone has ever done is it creepy.
A little bit but yeah so and then he.
Like screenshotted like a picture or.
Like a screenshot from my draw my life.
Video and framed it which was really.
Cute they're just like pictures of my.
Family everywhere and then my two.
Childhood crushes which were dylan and.
Cole sprouse were like okay they're.
Funny now i still don't want one.
Otherwise none but they're twee hazard.
Bunny yeah yeah one of them like works.
In a brewery has like like disney are.
They from disney yeah you know exactly.
Cody brenda song what's it i don't.
Remember.
Suite suite life of zack & cody oh yes i.
Heard of that those guys grew up and.
They're like yeah well i mean that's.
Like yeah it was super thoughtful and.
Yeah it's a really really cute room that.
He got like this old tv with like eh v8.
Why can't i speak vhs tapes so it was.
Really really sweet.
I was crying how long have you guys been.
Dating uh we basically two years we met.
Three years ago and then we dated for.
Like almost a year and then broke up for.
Like six months and then got back.
Together now it's been like a little.
Over a year since we got back together.
Yeah you guys are super in love thing to.
Say oh life i mean i grew up from a.
Family that's not really touchy-feely.
But good but when i see you guys.
Together.
Yes a very loving person he is he's such.
A passionate lover i could tell well you.
Guys have met before because i mean like.
We're just talking about this earlier.
But you actually sing and i didn't know.
That at first but you you guys came here.
I don't know if you guys work together.
Or not but i know dom came here as well.
To work with david oh yeah we did one.
Song you guys made a song yeah dom dom i.
Think you guys both wrote it or dumb.
Dawn wrote that one okay it's very sweet.
Song mhm and i mean i was i've always.
Told beth this but i think you know.
She's one of the most underrated singers.
On youtube i think she could have done.
Music if she didn't do beauty but you're.
Doing that right now right yeah a little.
Bit i think it's just one of those.
Things that i've dabbled in so much and.
I really want to do but it's like i'll.
Do it i'll like i put out a song like.
Five years ago or something and then i.
Was like i don't know it's.
I'm just so unsure and also i just want.
To like i know it's one it's one of.
Those things or it's like almost waiting.
For the right time but i also kind of.
Just wanted to perfect it more before i.
Start putting it out because i just.
Always want to give people something.
That i feel is of substance and that i'm.
Proud of and if i feel like it's not.
Really there for me then i don't really.
Want to share it that's kind of like you.
You do you should sort of like that too.
Like i was i was more like that and then.
Now it's just i make podcasts oh no i.
Mean i mean we still we still have.
Projects like that but i yeah i wanted.
To be able to just do things that are.
Like i don't know free not having like.
So much thought into every single thing.
I still want to do those things as well.
And i feel like you're the same way but.
Like what is your main focus right now.
Because you you do so many things that.
You're doing your videos you know like.
You said you were doing the the clothing.
The fashion thing and then.
You sing when she trying to dance to for.
A little bit obviously you learning.
Dance if you're living well you're not.
Living with dom but since you guys are.
Dating cuz all he does is dance and.
Every moment if he will be in the car.
And he'll just start like yeah he does i.
Started doing a lot of freestyle dance.
You it's really bad uh no i haven't.
Really been dancing you would think like.
We don't really dance together he's.
Actually taught me a few things and he's.
Like choreographed little things for us.
That we never like finished but dancing.
Is something that i kinda really only.
Went for with dancing with the stars.
Like that was the most i've ever really.
Pursued that i kind of wanted to pursue.
It a little more after the fact but yeah.
I don't know i think it was fun but it's.
Definitely not something that i see.
Myself doing like it being amazing fun.
You were like i thought you were a.
Dancer from that i mean you're pretty.
Good i mean i took dance classes growing.
Up and then once i got the offer for.
Dancing with the stars i was like i.
Really want to do it cuz dance is always.
Something that i really enjoyed but just.
Never really went for and yeah i think i.
Definitely surprised myself maybe was.
Also just like having such a good.
Teacher but i definitely found myself.
Doing things that i didn't know i could.
Do especially because it's so many.
Different styles it's like every week.
It's like you'll have salsa then you'll.
Have like jive then you'll have like.
Contemporary and so i just became more.
Aware of my body which was really cool.
But yeah i think i kind of fell in love.
With dance a little bit during that show.
It's just something that is kind of cool.
To have like i think i could incorporate.
It into certain things in the future but.
Definitely wouldn't be like my main.
Thing how long ago was that when you.
Were on that show.
That was 2014 i think would you say that.
You're your excitement about dance got.
You more interested in dawn it was about.
The time right yeah i thought about that.
I don't think so.
Maybe she maybe it was like a.
Subconscious like wow i'm really loving.
Dance good this guy is a dancing that's.
Actually attractive that's actually what.
Made us like hang come together yeah.
Because it wasn't like a youtube.
Youtube creator summit like one of the.
After parties and i was just really into.
Like anytime i would be at an.
After-party or anything i'd always be.
Salsa dancing i don't really know how to.
Do it but i enjoy it and so i just.
Remember there was like this crowd of.
People and i was like who here is gonna.
Salsa dance with me tonight and i kind.
Of knew you said that no i just thought.
It i thought that every time i would.
Like go to a party i was like who here.
Looks like they would salsa dance with.
Me and so i knew he was a dancer.
Obviously and so we just started salsa.
Dancing and then we just like dancing.
With my instant the attraction that was.
Actually the first time that i was like.
Oh he's cute because i met him before.
That at the tony robbins conference and.
I just he was like cool as i go cool.
Cool but isn't really intuitive see the.
Skills yeah i didn't see those moves i.
Was like see the advantage of being a.
Dancer because i don't know what it is.
About dance but women just love it it is.
Attractive it is and yeah it's.
Attractive when someone knows how to.
Move their body mm-hmm well paco can.
Dance is how's that working not any more.
I used to as a breakdancer b-boy oh.
Really.
Dom did but he got more into like uh it.
Was a go choreo i guess dom's well.
Versed in in dance.
David and i was variants at all i'm the.
Worst dancer i'm too stiff like i look.
Like a would going back to what david.
Was saying like you're actually a good.
Singer and david doesn't just give out.
Compliments he's very blunt actually.
Borderline mean to people that don't.
Know how david is like talented people.
Yeah like they will be straight up and.
He won't say you're good unless you all.
Unless you really are but he does tell.
I've asked david before i was like can.
Everyone sing and what was your answer.
To that all honesty you want me to be.
Honest or happy off be completely honest.
Can anyone sing or learn to sing yes yes.
They can learn to sing but.
But i do believe some people are born.
With natural talent and some people will.
Never have that will never sound good.
Even if even if they learn they won't.
Have that i think weird that but with.
Dance david and our that will with dance.
That's what i'm saying like i you look.
Like a dancer when you dance even he.
Looks like a dancer when he dances but.
When david and i dance where that where.
Those people who just can't wait i think.
I can no what i'm saying is you can.
Learn but you'll never be you never look.
I'll never be a d-trix yeah that's for.
Sure.
Wait so you're saying so like i said.
Some people that are really great.
Singers that it's natural someone who.
Worked really hard could never like.
Attain that sort of i'm gonna disappoint.
A lot of people no but to a certain.
Level it's true right i think that they.
Come down to just their natural speaking.
Voice that sounds better i don't think.
It's about the speaking voice for me i.
Think it's more about like so the way.
That i would explain is you know you.
Find young kids who are amazing singers.
Right you guys agree with that you'll.
See like turn on on those tv shows.
They're naturally gifted they did not.
Learn how to do that because they were.
Taught they were just born that way and.
I think there are a lot of people like.
That in many different fields like.
Including dance singing or intelligence.
Right i think like there are people who.
Are born with it but then i do think.
That you could work on anything you can.
Get good to a certain point but i don't.
Know if you could achieve greatness that.
Makes sense i think it's true it's just.
Like being good at basketball right like.
I could be the like i could work my ass.
Off and i'll still be five eight and.
Never in the nba and even there are five.
Eight players shorter people who can.
Dunk i think no matter how much i would.
Have work like that i could come haha i.
Can done there's a basketball game that.
Ryan and i are playing and those right.
After the game we're kind of sitting.
Down just like relaxing and then this.
One asian kid just like palm the ball.
Ran up and dunked and he was like a.
Little bit shorter and the first thing.
Me and ryan did was we stood up.
Really he's shorter than us but like.
Possible so i mean why did i bring that.
Up.
Oh about island musical time yeah and.
Then in for dance like you could dance.
Because it's kind of natural for you i.
Was saying like no matter how much david.
And i train we'll never.
We could get good to let the point our.
Cap i think i get it yeah but like you.
Have like this high cap for like dance.
And singing mm-hmm and i don't know.
Things that you i mean i would never do.
That show let's put it that way.
Dancing with the stars you'd never do it.
Never there's got to be some great.
Incentive for me to embarrass myself.
That way but also i think taking this.
And in another route is like you are a.
Very kind of introverted kid it sounds.
Like but you have all these natural.
Talents within you that what did you.
Kind of always just know what's there or.
Was it just like oh this seems.
Interesting and you pick it up very.
Easily i like with the singing i feel.
Like i was always singing when i was.
Younger and i just remember remember.
Like getting mad when people in the car.
Would sing with me and they were like.
Off-key eight-year-old me so mad about.
That that means you have really good so.
We're saying is a pitch and like i think.
I mean this is a question i like to ask.
A lot of musicians and singers is who.
And your family is musically gifted so.
Usually when i ask my musician friends.
It's either their mom dad both grandpa.
Grandma it's always like that so i was.
Wondering if if that applies to you as.
Well maybe an uncle or not it's like.
Gifted and actually a lot my mom is and.
My grandpa and then a lot of my cousins.
Is a mom so my mom sign gotcha yeah so.
It's it's true my theory is still.
Correct see it so it is something you're.
Kind of born with and it is to i mean to.
A certain degree it's gotta be genetic.
Right mikage in your genes because i.
Mean i it's gonna sound bad but like.
There's certain ethnicities that ever.
Like my majority of that ethnicity can.
Sing you know i mean like i think the.
Majority filipinos but a lot of.
Filipinos can sing a lot like black.
Most of them i know can at least sound.
Better than your average person yeah i.
Don't know if that's true or not i might.
Be making stuff up but how by people i.
Know yeah are all at least somewhat.
Decent like have nice either it's a nice.
Deep voice or like they came to actually.
Sing or something.
As a musician i will verify that okay so.
I'm not being the truth i find the.
African-americans filipinos generally.
Speaking the darker you i don't know.
What it is i don't know what it is i.
Think it's maybe the the their vocal.
Cords their structure darker - yeah well.
Pretty i don't know now we're just.
Basing it on racist on it but it's it's.
A great root of thing it's a positive.
Stereotype yeah even i've heard some.
Like even you know african americans are.
Not greats they say that i'm so bad and.
They sing and i'm like they're so good.
You're such a liar like you're just all.
Really good at singing or they have a.
High cap for that right they could learn.
To sing right yeah and it sucks being.
Filipino and not being able to sing well.
You're only part you know what i've.
Never heard you sing because i can.
That's what they all say have you tried.
Yeah yeah let's hear something no next.
Question that was a nice tone you next.
Question okay.
Well now we know so you're gonna be a.
Singer dancer you're basically made to.
Be a pop star.
You got the fashion a little bit of.
Everything what is in like not joking.
Around what is your next thing you want.
To do uh i mean honestly the music is.
One thing that i've just recently.
Started taking more seriously and i.
Think it's because i've been so scared.
With it for so long that i just kind of.
Have been diving deeper into it recently.
And yeah so definitely music stuff and.
Then just kind of getting back into.
Youtube again i think that i needed to.
Take a break to kind of just reset and i.
Think i felt this almost this pressure.
Of also who people kind of perceived me.
To be for so long especially getting.
Into it so young that was.
Kind of one of the biggest challenges i.
Faced was as i got older was kind of.
Breaking from these ideas of how people.
Saw me which definitely i was never fake.
Like that was 100% me at the time but.
Then as i started getting older and then.
I did start having more of a social life.
And did start like kind of exploring.
Myself more it didn't necessarily add up.
With what people were used to seeing so.
Yeah i just kind of needed time to take.
A break from all of that and it's kind.
Of like what you said is like i want.
That kind of freedom back of not feeling.
So much pressure of everything that i.
Post has to be like the most perfect.
Thing in the world right and just the.
Fact that i could actually just post is.
Enough and as long as i actually enjoyed.
It that's more than enough because i.
Definitely got to a point where i wasn't.
Enjoying it and it was just a big stress.
Ball i can relate to that 100% like i.
Definitely have seen your vlogs this is.
Like a wall aback but just like knowing.
You outside of youtube because i met you.
Before i seen your videos and then i.
Want to go check out your videos i was.
Like oh that's interesting you're a lot.
More you know like like myself a lot.
More like energetic than you would be.
Like talking here and it is hiring and.
Especially for getting older since you.
Started at what age was that 13 yeah 13.
You're basically one of those you're.
Like one of those disney kids right who.
Was trapped in the same like hey guys.
You know like one of those things and.
Then not that you were like that i'm.
Just saying the disney no but when.
You're trapped into this thing you just.
It's it's exhausting because you grow up.
Everybody grows up and to a certain.
Degree you just you need to have that.
Switch and people aren't gonna like it.
But it has to happen look at miley cyrus.
And it works yeah okay.
Well oh we are at the sheshe brake part.
Of our show so i guess we'll be right.
Back.
Music.
And we're back and before we get back.
Actually i forgot in the beginning of.
The episode but thank you and child to.
Road for these mics because they gave it.
To us for free and the road cast and the.
Road caster so again thank you to road.
For all your needs for things that are.
Audio actually don't know is it.
It's just audio road there's a lot of.
Audio yeah for your audio needs it's.
Like a their slogan oh i'm reading it.
Like an ad for your audio needs road.
Take the high road they could use that.
They don't have to use that alright and.
Now we're really back okay do we want to.
Start with likes we have a we don't.
Always get a lot of questions from.
People but when we put out your name and.
Saying you're gonna be in the podcast we.
Got a lot of questions so you want to go.
Through some of those yeah we have.
People haven't hurt a lot of people.
Don't even know that you started up.
Again yeah yeah so i think they're kind.
Of curious about what you're doing cool.
Yeah we got one here what have you been.
Doing since not posting videos we talked.
About that but i mean that's that's what.
They're interested in we where we can.
Take that too is a lot of youtubers or.
Even content creators have been taking.
Breaks lately they've been saying like.
You know i need to i've been getting.
Burnt out or i need to take care of my.
Mental health and stuff and maybe this.
Is something that you vibe with and.
That's something that you felt at the.
Time or maybe you feel a little.
Differently so maybe we can get an idea.
And like pick your brain about that so.
Kind of y-you know you took a break and.
What do you been doing yeah i mean i.
Feel like the youtuber break thing has.
Definitely become like a thing for a lot.
Of people especially in the past like.
Two years i it's almost like when i.
First saw that other people were doing.
It it was kind of comforting i was like.
Okay i'm not the only one that's like.
Experiencing this and having these same.
Feelings coz when it happened to me i.
Feel like no one had ever talked about.
That at that point or at least i had.
Never heard anyone talk about that and.
So i felt like it's something going.
With me that that like i'm suddenly.
Feeling all of this stuff like mentally.
With my craft and yeah cuz when it first.
Happened to me it was i think i didn't.
Realize that maybe i needed to take a.
Break but it's been incredibly helpful.
For me i think just to kind of distance.
Myself a little bit and work on myself.
Because for me at least i feel like i.
Was so in it that i completely a little.
Bit like kind of lost a part of me and i.
Wasn't keeping up with myself so i.
Wasn't like my full self for my audience.
And i feel like they definitely saw that.
And yeah so i think when i first noticed.
It was like 2014-2015 when i was just.
Like i need to like step away and even.
Doing that was so hard because people.
Want things like all the time and it was.
Really hard to kind of step away from.
That and i feel like a lot of people.
Were confused because i never really.
Liked old people why i took a break but.
It was kind of just what i needed to do.
For my own mental health and just kind.
Of checking in with myself and and just.
Kind of like reconnecting with the world.
A little bit and appreciating things.
Outside of social media that helped so.
Much because i used to find myself.
Almost like getting anxious if i was.
Like if i was somewhere really cool and.
Experiencing something if feeling this.
Need to have to post about it and if i.
Didn't i felt like dang it i didn't do.
That and i'd be upset about it and like.
Who am i getting upset that i didn't.
Show this to everybody yeah and i i.
Could have had an amazing time but i.
Didn't because i was so worried about.
Posting and i think everyone can relate.
To that even you know people like girls.
Who were worried about impressing a guy.
It's like oh i didn't post this thing.
That i went to this party so i'm so mad.
About that instead of just literally.
Enjoying it and not worrying about.
Having to post it because it just kind.
Of takes you out of the moment so that.
Was one of the most valuable things i've.
Learned is to actually just kind of.
Enjoy life and now it's easier to kind.
Of get back into it because i feel much.
More myself than i was what are some.
Other ways that you can.
Said you were working on yourself.
Outside of you know creating creating.
Youtube videos like what what were some.
Other things that you did for yourself.
Besides not posting on social media some.
Activities or like what does that mean.
To you like to that you're working on.
Yourself is something taking a break.
Even like what does that mean yeah some.
People may go out to a meditation.
Retreat or see you they know yeah it's.
Huge right now some people may just.
Focus on a relationship or some people.
May go traveling like what or maybe do.
Nothing right like what what are some.
Things that you you did to kind of get.
To that place where you feel free uh i.
Definitely didn't go on any retreats.
Yeah i feel like i didn't do any of that.
Like meditation which meditation is.
Great and i've tried it and it's cool i.
Just didn't really do any of that stuff.
I feel like i just more so dove into.
Myself and asked myself questions about.
Like kind of where i was at with myself.
And how i felt about myself and then i.
Started to realize that also because i.
Started making video so young i think i.
I know at one point i felt this pressure.
Of like my appearance in my body at one.
Point because like everything that i do.
Is so like it's always been so like.
Fashion and that kind of focused so.
Obviously like my appearance was a part.
Of that and i think that i let that.
Stuff kind of tarnish my view of my like.
Self if that makes sense so i kind of.
Did a lot of like almost just like kind.
Of doing like i don't know how to.
Explain it more so just like thinking.
About it and in understanding myself and.
What made me kind of get farther away.
From myself and it kind of had to love.
Myself again and love myself more than i.
Ever had before which then i think it.
Comes into like a whole other thing it's.
Not even about youtube as much that's.
Just kind of like life stuff that i.
Think everybody on some level at some.
Point in life experiences it's like i.
Feel like i didn't fully love myself at.
That point and then kind of feeling like.
I had to please everybody at that point.
In my life wasn't helping the fact that.
I wasn't really loving myself and so i.
Needed to step away from.
Everything to figure out how to get that.
Love back for myself and it just came.
Down to honestly what helped me is like.
Being a kid again and like just being.
Curious about life in a way that i feel.
Like i kind of got jaded to a lot of.
Things in life kind of what i was saying.
Earlier were when i was younger i didn't.
Realize what was going on to the point.
That it was happening so much that i.
Think i failed to even be as grateful as.
I could have been and that was one of.
The most valuable things that i've.
Learned in like the past few years and.
During taking a break is just how to be.
Amazed by life again and be excited.
About living that was that's beautiful.
It's great no i think a lot of people.
Need to hear that yeah and i think.
Because you're in the beauty space in.
Particular you know beauty is all about.
Kind of like an outward parent your.
Outward appearance right now if you.
Write down beauty in the superficial.
Form but like you know it's going back.
To what you said about rediscovering.
Yourself and figuring out like who am i.
First before i can start putting on the.
Makeup and the outfits right i think.
It's it's pretty interesting that you.
Brought that up because never thought of.
It that way yeah and i think that's good.
For other creators to hear like you said.
At the time i guess 2015 you said you.
Kind of took your break it wasn't the.
Same thing as like this past year right.
Wherever you hear everybody is like oh.
I'm burnt out i need to take a break it.
Definitely must have been hard to have.
To like you had so much success and so.
Much momentum that it's not an easy.
Thing like even even now for me this is.
Like my version of a break but i'm still.
Doing stuff it's i can't even imagine.
Like i just just getting myself to this.
Point was so difficult like how did you.
How did you convince yourself to be like.
Okay this is the best decision for my.
Life to take a break when you have all.
This momentum going for you you have a.
Successful channel that's bringing in.
Revenue and you know at any point if you.
Do stop you'll still have your hardcore.
Fans but you do know if you do stop.
There's a most youtubers know that.
That's like deadly to your career right.
Yeah so how did you get to the point.
Where you convinced yourself or where.
You add a breaking.
Point where you just said i have to do.
It it was kind of both because i think.
That i was continuing to try to put.
Stuff out when i was already feeling.
That way and i just felt like it wasn't.
As good as it could have been if i was.
Like in a better place so i knew for.
That reason that i probably needed to.
Like take a break and it was really hard.
To step away but i think it was a bit of.
A feeling of just like i know that i.
Could be happier and i know that i could.
Be in a better place so maybe i just.
Need to to listen to how i feel right.
Now and take the action that i need to.
And also it's like i feel like at the.
End of the day i don't really have.
Anything to lose because as long it's so.
Cheesy your truth you know like i'm so.
Happy like i'm so happy with life in a.
Way that i'm like wasn't back then and.
So i wouldn't change any of that and and.
I knew that obviously it was gonna.
Change things if i wasn't uploading as.
Consistently especially if like there.
Are people girls my same age that are.
Posting exactly what i'm posting that.
Are more consistent than me obviously if.
I'm not keeping up with that then people.
Would prefer to watch them but i think.
Was just learning to be okay with that.
And not letting that it was almost more.
Of an ego thing and i feel like once i.
Let once i kind of understood my ego and.
I was able to control that it helped so.
Much because i was like i would i had.
These fears that didn't even really.
Exist but it was only because of my ego.
Mm-hmm fears of like other people.
Surpassing you like the girls your age.
And stuff like that yeah talking about.
Yeah okay that makes sense that is a.
Tough thing to do i don't think.
Necessarily if you haven't really been a.
Creator it's hard to explain that fear.
Yeah a lot of people when you tell them.
Oh i'm burnt out or like recently like.
Lilly as mentioned and other youtubers.
Have came on and said oh you know what.
They're burnt out they gotta take a.
Break i see all these comments are like.
Oh wow must be tough being a millionaire.
Who's famous and they don't really.
Understand you know or they think it's a.
Lot easier to do what we do to a certain.
Degree where even if it wasn't easy.
Though it's like everybody knows.
Themselves better.
And anyone else right so i think that.
Part of it for other creators i think.
They understand now like that's.
Everybody can burn out yeah for people.
Who don't have these kind of who aren't.
In these lucky fortunate situations.
Where some people just can't take those.
Breaks.
What would you say that those people i.
Mean i mean it's hard i know it i'm not.
Putting you on the spot cuz i i try and.
Think about that too.
Because i understand what you're saying.
But i feel like it's hard for me to.
Preach that to people who can't afford.
To like you know that my job is too much.
Right i'm burnt out i need this job but.
I have to do it how would we i'm just.
Trying to see for myself how do you.
Reach out to those people and give them.
The same advice absolutely yeah i think.
That there are ways that everyone can do.
It to be completely honest i think that.
If i don't think i really what i did in.
My situation is i completely stepped.
Away but i don't think that i really had.
To do that i think that there definitely.
Was ways for me to continue what i was.
Doing while being smart in accomplishing.
What i did in the past few years as far.
As like myself personal growth i think i.
Could have done that simultaneously.
While staying consistent but i didn't do.
That i think it's because i was just so.
In fear i was so afraid and so confused.
That i just wanted to completely shut it.
All off but i don't think that was.
Really necessary i think that's just.
What i felt that i needed to do because.
I look back on it and and yes i did take.
That break but part of me is like you.
Know maybe i should have just at least.
Stayed a little more consistent and and.
Worked on myself so i think there's a.
Lot that you can do even if you can't.
Just completely stutter away yeah i.
Think it's what i found to be the most.
Valuable is literally just being able to.
Be honest with myself and be just.
Transparent about where i am personally.
And just really diving into yourself and.
That's kind of the part that can be hard.
For people too is you know it's it's.
Being open with yourself about like what.
Your fears are what you're afraid of.
What it is because i think also the.
Biggest problem is that i didn't want to.
Admit that it was my ego and i think i.
Could have figured all that out while.
Still being consistent i just kind of.
Chose to step away okay with.
It's good advice i'm wondering did you.
Have like what is your circle look like.
Your circle of friends i know you worked.
With you work with your dad he's been.
Pretty integral in your career like did.
You have friends to kind of like help.
You get through this i know you're.
Dating dom but was there anybody else in.
Your circle or was it your family that.
Kind of helped you come to this.
Realization and kind of eliminating your.
Ego yeah i mean i definitely surrounding.
Myself with friends is helpful and i've.
Done that it's also nice just to like.
Like i said just be more in the moment.
With people because i feel like i wasn't.
Always the best at doing that so yeah.
Definitely.
Just making more time for friends and my.
Family has always been really supportive.
My dad has been there since the first.
Video so i always like go to him for.
That kind of stuff as well because he's.
Always very encouraging and also kind of.
Helps me remember like why i started.
Doing it all in the first place and it.
Wasn't for obviously like we didn't know.
That any of the success was even.
Possible at that point like back then.
It's like we didn't even know that you.
Could make a career out of it and so he.
Always kind of reminds me of that like.
The little me that started it so yeah.
And when you started you were you're.
Pretty young so like like how do you.
Balance like your dad like the.
Relationship between your dad as someone.
Who's integrating your business and then.
Also your dad like it's kind of it can.
Get a little weird right i mean yeah i.
Think it was definitely it was.
Definitely more challenging when we.
Lived together because it was hard to.
Separate the two but once i kind of.
Moved out and like had my own place and.
All of that it honestly got way easier i.
Think there's something about it's like.
I don't really want to talk about.
Business over dinner you know it's like.
You want to separate the two so i think.
That's the only time that it was really.
Challenging but everything else it's.
Like he's always just down for whatever.
I want to do and just backing me up and.
Whatever my decision is for whatever it.
May be but yeah he's definitely i got to.
I got to know him.
Better than you actually on the a couple.
Of tours that we've done like a lot of.
Times you'd be like you and your dad and.
Your mom yeah and basically be with your.
Mom and we just be hanging out with your.
Dad and i guess that's kind of speaks to.
Like what you were saying like you were.
Kind of like to yourself kind of thing.
But he would constantly be like he has.
Good ideas he's constantly like pitching.
He's like he's always coming to music.
Not even for you he's like hey what if.
We did this what if you did this and he.
Keep pitching ideas so i think i know.
What you mean when you say like once you.
Weren't in the household because if he's.
Constantly i don't know if he did the.
Same thing to you but to me i was like.
These are good but if i had that every.
Single day like morning and night i.
Think that would be pretty yeah it could.
Be a lot i mean it's all great intention.
Like oh he's right he's great yeah he.
Definitely yeah i think kind of tying it.
Back to what david said in the first.
Half where music can be tied to like.
Your parents and stuff so in the aspect.
Of like how hard you were grinding and.
Like possibly like you know you burnt.
Yourself out and stuff like it sounds.
Like maybe you got that from your dad.
Just that that work ethic and yeah i'm.
Just curious as to what like what does.
He do.
Besides you know before like you were.
Doing youtube instead of farmer yeah he.
Worked on dairy farms cuz we grew up.
Like central california so it's like.
Only dairy farms like no shopping malls.
Los manos our from fresno cuz like.
Basically if we wanted to go to any.
Shopping mall we'd have to either go to.
Modesto at fresno cuz there's like.
There's nothing in the town we got a.
Target and everybody was like really.
Stoked about i was like my where i'm.
From hilo small small town yeah yeah.
Super small town so he would just work.
On like electricity and like building.
Dairies and he owned his own dairy.
Business so he was like knew how to be a.
Business owner but yeah i was all like.
Dairy farms up until i asked him to be.
My manager do you know to milk a cow i.
Don't i've been around a lot of cows but.
I never never tried to milk when i had a.
Lot of pet cows too because we lived.
Though isn't it.
You have to you know hey what do you.
Mean i mean i was a farmer.
I guess dairy everyone talked about.
Their pets in there also if you're no.
They just they went to another farm they.
Just went through the other i mean i i.
Don't know i'm family members who had.
College but they had them for different.
Reasons.
Yeah we we had cuz we lived literally on.
A dairy farm one of the farms that he.
Worked on and so we just had like a.
Bunch of cows i remember one night like.
Two o'clock in the morning there was a.
Bunch of noise outside of the house and.
I woke up and there was just like cows.
Like i opened the window and just a cow.
Like right there at the window cuz they.
Just broke free and so your sleep.
Surrounding our honey i grew up with.
Cows too all around me so it's like that.
Constant i know i can i can just smell.
It.
I can smell where you live manure yeah.
Do you have any siblings.
Everyone's sister younger older she is.
Older she's five years older and she has.
Two beautiful daughters what does she.
Think about your youtube career and she.
Actually started a channel like shortly.
After i did and she was going with it.
For a while i don't know if she's still.
Posting on it but yeah she got into it.
For a second - it's funny cuz i think.
She might have made fun of me right in.
The beginning when i started and then.
She was like i'm gonna get on this - in.
What way like what are you doing yeah do.
You think you are.
Yeah i feel like everybody yeah i got.
About so much flesh in the beginning.
Yeah she was probably had public school.
Like my sister makes youtube videos.
Public school yeah okay and then you.
Were saying on the break that you you.
Chose to go do private schooling yeah.
And your sister chose the public route.
Why did you choose private school.
Instead of public i just was i just.
Never really liked public school and my.
Parents just gave us a choice or like if.
You want to be homeschooled you can so i.
Was like okay i'm.
Doing that i just felt like i just felt.
Like i was wasting time like in between.
Like if i cuz if i had it my way i was.
Like i just want to go to school do all.
The work no recess no lunch just like.
Let me do all the work and then go home.
And that's what homeschooling was is it.
Still like five hours a day or well well.
How long at school yeah how does that.
Work how does the homeschooling system i.
Never asked this to someone before but.
I'm does it yeah what do you wake up at.
A certain time do you just do york when.
You want um your yeah you basically do.
Whenever you want.
That was a problem though is i feel like.
It definitely taught me a lot about like.
Managing my own stuff and like having a.
Schedule a little bit though because.
Actually not maybe not because i started.
To get in this habit where i would do.
All my work for the week like the night.
Before i had to go in because basically.
I still had a teacher so i'd meet with a.
Teacher once a week and i would give her.
All of my work for that week and then if.
There were any tests then i would do.
Those tests and so basically it's like.
If i had to meet with her every tuesday.
I would literally leave all my work for.
Like monday you'd procrastinate which is.
The same thing as every other student in.
Public school really i would do my work.
As soon like in class if i could like.
Homework and stuff like that just so i.
Could like have fun at home it was just.
So i don't have to worry about it.
I was opposite well anyway that's in.
Know you had a i thought it was your.
Parents that i you know i don't know.
Much yeah well i mean i would like.
Supervise i guess or like held me here.
And there but yeah it's like i had an.
Actual teacher technically got it so.
With a teacher like go to your home or.
You me now at this place and there's.
Other homeschooled kids or is it just.
Like one thing she's you would like go.
In and there were like all the teachers.
And their cubicles really interesting so.
Did you have any friends then any we.
Kind of talked about it but yeah i did i.
Had friends from public school and then.
Also once i became homeschooled for a.
Couple years that's when i was in dance.
Class and then i took theatre for a.
Little bit too so i made new friends.
Through that well do you still keep in.
Touch with them or.
Um not so much i mean a few like when i.
Go back home but yeah not not as much as.
I should.
Well that was one long twitter question.
Do you have any scary fan encounters oh.
It's a pretty consistent question yeah.
Yeah hurry.
Scary or just like interesting less.
Interesting creepy yeah okay a really.
Good pitch that was a good pitch the way.
That she said yeah you got some okay hmm.
Well i have one that's like weird to.
Talk about now a curious no um this guy.
A while back this was probably i don't.
Even remember may 2013 2014 this guy.
That watched my videos he was a lot.
Older than me maybe by like twenty or.
Thirty years he came to a couple.
Meet-and-greets and it was just like.
Strange scenarios but then the weirdest.
One was i got a like a package or like a.
Letter to my house.
This is when i was still living with my.
Family and we opened it up in there was.
Like this usb thing and so we put it in.
The computer and it was the video of.
This guy and he just started saying like.
All this stuff and he was just like so i.
Have your address and like i'm going to.
Tell you how i found it and he like.
Pulled up the listing of like my house.
And it was like clicking through the.
Photos for some reason i'm like yes i.
Know what my house looks like photos of.
Your house well like has he found the.
Listing of the house mine and so just.
Like started clicking through it and.
Just like was like you should like just.
Basically he was telling me like i.
Should be more careful with my personal.
Information cuz like it could really for.
Him he was like it could affect your.
Well-being and i was like you're so.
Right.
And just like said some like honestly.
Weird stuff and it really freaked me out.
And from that point i was like i can't.
Live here anymore is that why you moved.
Um yeah that was one of the reasons oh.
So this is a little more recent then not.
Like when you first started no well yeah.
This was like probably four or five.
Years ago yeah what about your your.
Parents are not there anymore in that at.
That location at the gun oh no we all.
Moved from there yeah so that was.
Probably the most like creepy weird.
Situation yeah.
And then i've just other than that it's.
Just been like little mishaps here and.
There mm-hmm well what about like weird.
Interactions because you do a lot of.
Meeting greets and stuff.
What's the weirdest thing somebody said.
To you uh i got proposed to a lot but i.
Don't like seriously though very weird.
No not i mean with candy not like.
Legitimate i mean has has anyone ever.
Gone.
Oh you're wow you're you don't look like.
How you look in your videos all the time.
I get that all the time yeah.
But shorter that too yeah it's.
Interesting because people see and i'm.
Sure it's even worse for you because.
You're in the beauty space right well i.
Don't know i don't know is it worse oh.
Do they come up to you and be like oh.
You look good and you're in your videos.
They say they say i've not seen that.
Before it's just like they don't mean it.
As insulting they're like oh you're a.
Lot taller or oh yeah you look a lot.
Skinnier in your videos or something.
Like i've gotten all of those i've.
Gotten that too i don't know if it's the.
Same for like you cuz you're a girl.
No i the only one i've gotten is height.
Is like a lot oh really like oh wow.
You're a lot shorter in person you take.
That as a dis or i mean i yeah not so.
Much anymore but back then it was like i.
Was really i really hated being so sore.
I hated being five three and so when.
People would say that i'm like thank you.
For reminding me.
But that was probably the only thing.
There was one time at a meet-and-greet.
This wasn't like she didn't say anything.
Maybe it was the lack of her saying.
Something that made it happen is like.
She basically wanted me to give a.
Piggyback ride but i didn't know that.
She like maybe she told me but i didn't.
Hear it cuz i was like really loud so i.
Was like this girl she comes up she just.
Jumps on my back and.
What that's that's assault she jumped on.
My back and i just what obviously wasn't.
Expecting it so i just fell to the.
Ground and i was like wearing a dress.
Fall to the floor and she immediately.
Just like gets back up and runs away and.
That was yeah so embarrassed.
I felt so bad press charges against her.
That's why she ran she was so happy like.
She doesn't she just wanted like a cute.
Picture how could you i know that's.
Funny if she's listening you're.
Remembered now have you ever gotten any.
Crazy gifts cuz i know i know from what.
I've heard females tend to get like more.
Extravagant gifts from fans than males.
Like i have a friend she got like an.
Iphone oh.
Have you ever gotten anything like that.
No any jewelry appeal box i used to yeah.
I did i mostly got like stitch stuffed.
Animals because she loves one stitch.
Yeah and a lot of handmade stuff mostly.
But never anything really drives me a.
Lot of food yeah we got another twitter.
Question here from selena what's what's.
The thing that you're most proud of.
Honestly today i was really proud that i.
Got your like super early.
I was really yeah you're one of those i.
Got here ten for la that's like being an.
Hour early it really la people are.
Always late so much that i literally was.
Like should i not go in it's like 10.
Minutes early maybe i should wait yeah.
That's very proud of us but other than.
That other than that uh most proud of.
Like that's a tough yeah like in what.
Genre of life like whatever you want it.
To be yeah let's say career do you feel.
Like um do you feel like you're.
Successful now i do.
You didn't when you were actually making.
Videos um you had to yeah yeah.
Definitely.
I think i also feel it like in a.
Different way now where i just feel like.
I i mean i feel like i know a little.
More like i still have obviously so much.
To learn but i feel like i i feel.
Success in a way of like i guess what i.
Understand and what i'm aware of now and.
Like just kind of how i define success.
Too because i think like how i defined.
Success in the past was maybe a little.
Different than i define it now but as.
Far as like my like biggest.
Accomplishment or like things i'm most.
Proud of i think we i think your answer.
Is great like yeah yeah like i think i'm.
Definitely proud of everything that i've.
Done career-wise like obviously i'm like.
Whoa that was that's really cool i did.
All that especially starting so young.
And not knowing that any of that was.
Possible and like building something at.
This age and also just doing something.
That i never thought i would do cuz i.
Just never saw myself as that person and.
Even the people around me never saw me.
As that person so i'm definitely really.
Proud of that and i definitely felt that.
Success but i'm also really proud of how.
Much i've evolved as a person and how i.
Also define success now because i feel.
Like it's just a lot healthier and more.
Fulfilling that's a good answer to a.
