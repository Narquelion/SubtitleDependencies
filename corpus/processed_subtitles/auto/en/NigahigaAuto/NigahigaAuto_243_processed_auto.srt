Start to the pollak know i didn't come.
Prepare today because normally i like if.
There's a guest in mind i'm like okay.
I'm gonna start.
Thinking about what to ask like what.
Kind of questions do i have but um this.
Is different for me this was your idea.
It was it was good i thought that this.
Would be a pretty fun episode for.
Mother's day not a lot of people.
Actually ever get to see auntie lucy on.
Camera she's on the camera a bit no ugly.
Every time i feel her she's all like.
What do you say ids what do i say i say.
Paco you know that this is not gonna be.
In the video yeah.
And you a lot of you cut it out though.
Right i'd be like i told you but i i.
Guess this would be cool to like you.
Know kind of see the person that you.
Know created and gave a lot of guidance.
To ryan you know so creator yeah well.
First of all happy mother's day to all.
The other mothers i since today it's not.
Technically mother's day for us today.
But it will be for people watching this.
So happy mother's day.
But sorry quit no no that's cool i do.
Just want to wish her you know i'm not.
Selfish.
Happy mother's day thank you paco yeah.
Laughter.
But uh yeah how about how about we just.
Go into a little bit of it you know.
Introduce yourself you know you're.
Ryan's mom but what else do you do for.
The company cuz a lot of people actually.
The superfans kind of know a little bit.
But there's a lot of stuff that you do.
Behind the scenes that you don't you.
Know ever show on camera oh it's really.
Cullen boring but i didn't want to know.
Still so it's not your choice if it's.
Boring or not we want to know the boring.
Stuff i just like to think of myself as.
I'm just helping behind the scenes i.
Don't like to be in front of the camera.
So i'll just be like behind the scenes.
Whatever you guys yes and trust me i.
Tried many times you know i mean like.
Heavy used to use his dad kevin b's uses.
His dad all the time and that every.
Video that he did with him worked really.
Well and then you know and your parents.
Kind of the opposite no they don't they.
Would not she would not well actually my.
Dad is worse he refuses to be you know.
To trick him to be into some stuff but.
She does she really doesn't like it.
Either.
Why is that what's your issue i don't i.
Don't like the way i look on camera you.
Know i don't like pictures and then i.
Don't think i sound good you know i.
Don't think like how about nice for you.
I don't like the way i sound.
Most people are like that yeah except.
For paco.
He's like so actually i didn't like the.
Way i sounded either when i was first.
Like editing my own videos i was like.
This sound what i learned is that the.
Reason why we're not used to hearing how.
We actually sound is because in our.
Heads our skulls act as like tuning.
Devices though yep.
So john's different yeah we sound.
Different yep so that's why when we hear.
Something how we actually sound like.
Whoa i know it's not how i imagined yeah.
Exactly.
So yes i don't like that and then i.
Don't like to act so like i don't mind.
This cuz i feel like you're just talking.
I'm just talking yeah or like that rap.
Video like i thought it was just playing.
A game or sometimes yeah so i mean it.
Was okay i was just being a good sport.
Yeah you're a great sport it was making.
My mom rap like eminem yeah for those at.
And that video was so funny when the.
Vacuum cleaner turns into the guy.
Larry's but uh how about let's let's go.
And i think this is kind of gonna be.
Almost like a long twitter type of.
Question yeah i mean there was a lot of.
Good questions yeah there and i just you.
Know we're gonna find out a little bit.
More about ryan's childhood really yes.
Yeah and your parenting tactics wow.
And you know we got to go kind of edgy.
At first though did you spank him as a.
Kid.
I must have because charlie talking only.
Goes so far but i wasn't like a wooden.
Spoon or i mean was i even like a ruler.
I think you did use a wooden spoon no.
You were more of a like pull your ear.
Like hey yeah and so my erection you do.
That because you can't see there's no.
Like.
You know like if you hide you might get.
A bruise just pinched it here just a.
Little redness it'll go away he's.
Abusive now in today's day and age.
That's considered child abuse know who.
Is worse though you are uncle wendell i.
Think it was equal except that i think.
His level like you know he's a little.
Bit more tolerant maybe like i'll go.
From like here to there i'd be like talk.
Talk and then okay and then it's like.
That's it zero two hundred is black and.
White for you yeah yeah and then also.
What i guess in ryan like growing up.
Because you guys are kind of similar in.
The aspect that you both have adhd right.
Yeah and so you saw yourself a lot of.
Yourself in him actually though i think.
Only when he got diagnosed then it was.
Like oh wow that's how i was you know.
Like when people talk after like really.
Focus otherwise i'm not listening and so.
It's bad when he and i go to a meeting.
Because i know he's not listening.
Listening i just don't know how much i.
Retain right i'm like i have to be like.
Like really he might not be listening.
You know but it's just interesting i'll.
Remember it but i think it's it's it's.
Good to know that you are because when.
You recognize it then you know what you.
Need to how you have to adjust herself.
Yeah like him i hate to read hmm i mean.
I just i just can't read through a whole.
Book mm-hm yeah you're not much of a.
Reader ryan's not much of a listener as.
Soon as ryan has his phone out i know i.
Should just stop talking because he's.
Not paying attention what yeah so going.
Into that going into a meeting together.
I think a lot of people don't know this.
Not so behind the scenes cuz you didn't.
Really go specifically into what you do.
But you are like an acting manager for.
Him right yeah but i don't like to say.
Am i i'm isn't manage i don't like you.
Saying what's your job because i don't.
Manage him i mean i i do things that.
Make his job easier or gives him time to.
Do what he needs to do which is like.
Create right yeah so i do all of the.
Other things all you know.
Business side of it and then like when.
You guys come i know he's not gonna cook.
So i'll cook threefold yeah make the.
Snacks clean up you know he doesn't have.
Time for that so aunty is kind of like a.
Manager caterer accountant what hust.
Actually an accountant retired now right.
And when you retired were you still uh i.
Guess was ryan.
When did you start kind of like helping.
Him out on the business aspect so i.
Think um it was good because we kind of.
Grew together right like we both knew.
Nothing of youtube and so we kind of.
Like learn together so i think it it was.
Kind of helpful for the relationship.
Because it wasn't like i knew more than.
Him he didn't know more than me and so.
We kind of just help each other along.
The way so it was it was pretty good and.
A lot of mistakes were made but learning.
Experience exactly.
And with that you know because a lot a.
Lot of especially asian parents would.
Not allow their child to go in something.
In like a creative aspect but because.
You guys were growing together do you.
Think that helped or what helped you be.
More understanding and leaning of.
Letting your son go into this when your.
Other better son kyle is a an x-ray.
Technician right right and he like.
Completed he graduated and you know he.
Is about to get married and he has a.
Career i mean he caused i don't know.
Kyle i think caused a better child well.
First of all you're not supposed to.
Compare paco.
When you become a parent you should not.
Appear your children that's funny no i.
Got better grades than him in school.
Yeah but he was the better dude over.
He was tamagotchi an underachiever yep.
He could have been like like so much so.
Much better at you know he could have.
Like even even two so he got his extra.
Tech and then he's debating or sure to.
Get his nuke man and i'm like oh you.
Should get your new command you know.
Because i mean what's two more years.
And he's like nuclear medicine degrees.
Right for those that don't know what.
Nuke med is basically it's an extra two.
Years of schooling right yeah so you.
Know he'd be the type like and i just.
Say it was 5050 because he's a type two.
Like i'm satisfied yeah you know but in.
Fact that's what ryan was gonna go into.
First and then yes so when he dropped.
Out i guess what was making you so like.
Understanding and accepting of that cuz.
Your first kid was like went through the.
Usual you know school career all that.
Stuff.
Oh no you still you still want i still.
Want it we still wanted him to go to.
School you know it's not like we said.
Like oh yeah go for it you know but i.
Think it's a parent's well the way we.
Think is that you want your kid to do.
Something that they enjoy right and so.
You force your kid to do something and.
What if they hate it but you but you.
Also as a parent want to tell them the.
Downside of what it is you know so i.
Remember i told him well you know if you.
Do this and it ends and you go back to.
College or your friends are all.
Graduated they'd be working and he's.
Like yeah it's like okay well you know.
You know you just give them the downside.
Cuz that's all you can do as long as you.
Make them aware and it's a part of your.
Job is to just give them guidance you.
Know but really you just want them to do.
What they want to do and then support.
Them how about for you ryan like at what.
Point were you like no i think this can.
Really be a thing for me like did you.
Have to do a lot of persuading for her.
Or was it more just like i'm gonna show.
No i mean i i it took me cuz i doubt i'm.
Like very conservative with like i don't.
Take a lot of risk you know and i knew.
The safe path was to just go and get my.
Degree like kyle and i was gonna get.
Into nuclear medicine i just thought it.
Was so boring and like i just didn't.
Like it but it wasn't a lot of her like.
It was more me coming to that point i.
Wasn't like i wouldn't i'm not the kind.
Of person to take that risk without.
Something to fall back on you know and i.
Think i think in his situation he was so.
Like frustrated and he was so stressed.
Because he was still doing youtube.
And then trying to study and then they.
Were like brands coming to us and you.
Know like calling and you know people.
Like calling contacting him and so it.
Was really stressful so i kind of like.
He had to do one or the other you know.
You had to make a choice yeah and at.
What point i guess were you completely.
Okay with all right you know i he is.
Financially stable you know that i'll.
Have to worry or you don't want do you.
Want him to go back to college still no.
No i mean like in the beginning it was.
Actually there was no earnings in the.
Beginning yeah yeah cuz that was like.
2009 before adsense right kind of well.
There was ad since but it was hardly any.
Advertising i'd even know about it like.
The partnership program was like not.
Things people knew about like only.
Certain youtubers got access to that in.
The beginning i would say like 99% of.
People did not know about it like did.
Not know that you could even make money.
Off of you off of you know posting.
Youtube videos so at the time it was a.
Bigger risk but you could still like.
Still there were some ads and stuff.
Coming in like in terms of like product.
Placement and stuff so it was a it was a.
Risk but it's not quite like hey you.
Know let's go and just do this thing and.
There's no money in it like follow your.
Dreams kind of think there was some.
Money in it but we didn't know yeah it.
Was gonna get so big you know i mean it.
Got big like maybe after 2010 yeah and.
So in the beginning they were it's.
Really no money but you could just see.
How stress he was so it was kind of like.
He couldn't go like do both he had to.
Make a choice plus i was here like in.
The dorms at unlv where like you have no.
Privacy and make for one that's already.
Stressful like to even make videos was.
Like not common people like i mean it.
Was embarrassing you know and to be like.
Oh you're with living with someone so.
You i have to literally wait until he's.
Gone to make my videos for one and then.
We have suite mates so it's like two.
Rooms and there's two people in each.
Room and you guys share a bathroom.
That's between the two rooms and yeah.
Essentially.
Like there's like no time where there.
Was like silence and so i would have to.
Go you know off campus and i was to film.
Some stuff if it was in my room then i'd.
Have to wait you know you're not just.
Working on your own schedule plus their.
School you know so it was a very uh not.
An ideal situation for either for both.
It was like either one is gonna suffer.
So it was to me it was an easier.
Decision um and then when i brought.
Brought it up to them i was like.
Surprised because i thought there was.
Gonna be more pushback it wasn't like.
The stories that you hear from a lot of.
Other like a so-called asian parents i.
Think a lot of parents would feel the.
Same but it wasn't it wasn't like.
Dramatic but i also think because we.
Come from hawaii it's a little bit.
Different from us because we do have.
Asian parents but i guess the whole way.
Culture you guys are more like lenient.
And understanding of different things.
You know you're not necessarily you're.
Talking like first-generation asian pear.
Yeah yeah it's like this is the model.
You follow yeah she's like she has i.
Mean you can just other than a hawaiian.
Like pidgin accent she doesn't have an.
Accent and she's like what do you third.
Generation third because you're your.
Grandfather i can write to hawaii so.
Even my grandparents don't have accents.
Right well pidgin well they were born in.
Hawaii yeah yeah and i guess because so.
You were born in hawaii right big on.
Right and uh and you have kind of a.
Bigger family right when you were.
Growing up what parallels do you see.
Similar to ryan growing up so you know.
We could get to know a little bit more.
About you get to know a little bit more.
About ryan because we touched on it a.
Little bit you said that you as well.
Have adhd right mm-hmm so like when you.
Were growing up and you saw ryan growing.
Up like what did you see similarities a.
Lot of for you did you punch girls in.
The stomach no but you know what i did.
Hit a boy i was older i wasn't like.
Kindergarten what my dad tells me i.
Don't quite remember but you know that's.
What he told me is the boy's father came.
To our house like i think he was asian.
Also.
Understand okay no because the culture.
Yeah i mean it's not like i was doing it.
Because i hated him or anything i think.
I think he either like he must have.
Harassed me or something i don't know.
What it was it had to be like around i'd.
Say second grade but i remember that.
Where did you punch him no i did i don't.
Even know like how i hit him but i.
Vaguely remember or yet a dad came to.
Our house i mean i know who the boy is.
And he still is in hilo that's a small.
Town no i didn't know sheep i see they.
Can't this back when i was a kid a kid.
Ago you know parents can't tell they're.
Bad so there's so much stuff no no the.
Thing is there's so many stars right.
Like like you have so many stories we.
Have so many stories but it doesn't just.
Come out yes someone has to dig it out.
Right you know there has to be like a.
Situation that and the time that the.
Teacher called the house that ryan punch.
The role in the stomach we are bright.
With everyone it's like uncle window.
Yeah i've got the car dad yeah but maybe.
If i got the call maybe i would i had a.
Flashback.
Laughter.
But i know that the boy he either like.
Chased me or he did something to me and.
I'd four brothers so it's kinda like i.
Was tomboy then oh yeah i was i was in.
Fact my dad was kind of worried that i.
Would be like totally like tomboy mmm.
Yeah i'm four brothers you know yeah you.
Have a really big family at people have.
Less like families have shrunk our main.
Other than like mormon families i guess.
But like in general like oh yeah it was.
Common to have like five brothers right.
And we're like a bunch of siblings yeah.
Because back then that's all they had.
You know there was no entertainment will.
You do when you're bored you know i.
Don't know if that's what it is i think.
Like they came from big families so it.
Was okay you know what i mean but now.
When you have when you have children.
It's kind of like you think that economy.
Yes and what a college costs and you.
Know so just different like i mean even.
Like our generation most of us like we.
Worked to pay for college you know but.
Now we pay for parents pay for college.
But that's because also you could work.
And pay for college and not be in like.
Huge amounts of debt how could you guys.
Music.
But you know a lot of times like we yeah.
I think we did spoil our kids you know.
Our generation but it's because we.
Didn't have have it easy so you know we.
Want to do whatever it can give them.
Whatever we can because we didn't get it.
Yeah i know but speaking on that uh i.
Just reminded me when you're talking.
About i guess who was the more.
Disciplinary one yeah i think it was her.
Because i do remember like and i only.
Know this this story because i don't.
Remember it specifically but i do know.
That though anytime i can really think.
Of that my dad really yelled a really.
Disciplined was that time when i.
Supposedly i guess he yelled at me and.
Said they told me that i don't really.
Remember too much by i punched the girl.
Right for cutting me in line so i push.
Her in the stomach she dropped a lot of.
Power behind this you know i was in.
Kindergarten and then i guess i got sent.
To the principal's office they called.
Home when i went home my dad was the one.
To you know normally she would be the.
One yelling or spanking or whatever it.
Is but apparently he was the one who had.
To deal with me and i don't really.
Remember i have no real unless i blocked.
It out i have no real memories of him.
Really you know disciplining me but.
Supposedly he gave me a big i don't know.
What he did yelling he's gonna make me.
Cry why didn't you cry but you wouldn't.
Cry yeah yeah yes prior i thought i was.
Right but you're never you're not really.
A crier cuz my i tried to make him cry.
Too.
You know his parents you should try to.
Make your kids because you kind of want.
To get a reaction right you know either.
Like yell back and and kyle and ryan i.
Used to hate it because when i used to.
Lecture them they'd never contest like.
They'd always be like okay i'll be like.
You know okay and i'd be like you know.
You kind of worth it but that's that's.
The.
You know how male and female yeah.
Females we like to like keep going.
Because you want to see that they're.
Engaged in the conversation not only.
That but i guess you want to get the.
Last word and they say okay shuts you.
Down.
It does it does so you kind of want him.
Yeah i remember the time that you didn't.
Remember like he told my dad used to.
Take pick him after school my dad used.
To pick him up and then take him to.
Basketball.
Doesn't the taste you know he hated.
Basketball and judo and so he would give.
My father like all these excuses have a.
Stomachache headache whatever and then i.
Find out later that oh he didn't go.
Because or he had stomachache.
It's just like fueling so we went home.
And i told him you know if you think.
That you're like smart enough like you.
Can make your own decisions then i'm.
Gonna pack your bags and you go to.
Grandpa's and you make all your.
Decisions and you're thinking oh he's.
Gonna cry just like it's just like sits.
There he doesn't cry you know so i pack.
Up this little bag and i and i leave it.
And i'm waiting for him to like tell me.
Something you know or come back with.
Something he doesn't go back into his.
Room so what you understand you know.
He's like okay and so then i tell him.
Because i have to get the last word.
Right cuz he said okay.
Something okay why i'm leaving this bag.
Right here so it's a reminder you're not.
Old enough to make your own decision if.
You're supposed to go basketball you're.
Going to basketball well i don't.
Remember that one but make sense sounds.
Like me i guess uh i guess we're talking.
About a lot about the bad things but how.
About you know each other dad i think i.
Was justified she cut me in line he was.
Challenging but that in a way was that.
Something that you saw positive in your.
Son oh for sure like where were some.
Other traits about him that you.
Recognize like oh no there's like a lot.
Of good things about it did you ever.
Recognize oh he he's gonna do great.
Things or did.
Noticed like oh he's a good kid did you.
Ever think he would have the influence.
That he has you know on a lot of.
People's lives oh no definitely i mean.
We didn't even see this whole youtube.
Thing yeah i mean that was like total.
Shock because and i think the first time.
We realized it is you and shawn made.
Rivo mm-hmm there was this like.
Nonprofit organization in hilo and they.
Know i guess it's part of like a bigger.
Organization but they were called revo.
And there was a myspace contest that if.
They got so many i don't know what it.
Was like sore throats or something and.
Then they could win like $20,000 or.
$10,000.
Yeah and so um he did a video he and.
Shawn did a video and they juan and then.
I was like and you know these are people.
All over the world.
Voting for him for these people in hilo.
So i was like i told him why ryan you.
You actually make a difference in the.
World you know and folks were like high.
School.
Yeah right like 15 probably yeah that.
Was quite a surprise that he's able to.
Like was able to reach people and people.
Like you know yeah when it came to like.
You actually saw that it made money for.
Someone and it was a good organization.
Like it was it promoting art and um they.
Had like art shows and stuff and it was.
A good nonprofit i think so yeah that.
Was like pretty cool but at the time we.
Didn't think i mean we didn't think much.
Shana i didn't think much of anything oh.
They're asking for something i guess.
Yeah and it was a funny video - yeah it.
Was just like oh yeah i guess back then.
And people just threw up whatever they.
Wanted yeah no but it was funny to be.
Honest what did you guys do with that.
Money.
No we so people had to go on myspace and.
Vote for them oh yeah and then they won.
Yeah so that was like impressive and.
They actually made a difference you know.
So that uh that's when you kind of saw.
Like oh yeah yeah she's not a normal kid.
I just think that he had like kid look.
At my beard i just think yes he has an.
Effect on people you know.
That that was quite a surprise and then.
I think the next in a couple years after.
That there was a boy he's like haha like.
Half japanese half dutch and he lived in.
Curacao.
And he actually asked his parents to.
Bring him to hilo so he could meet ryan.
So he was bullied in school because you.
Know i guess like there's hardly any.
Asians and so he was instructed she was.
Too far from the mic just so people are.
Wondering so he he watched ryan's videos.
Yeah he seems to be like really like i.
Don't know how bad he felt but he was.
Bullied right he was pretty amazed like.
This how old was he he must've been like.
A little like nine year old or something.
As this young kid and he looked very.
Depressed and yeah i just remember we.
Had to i get no idea you were talking to.
The mom i guess she contacted the paper.
What she contact the newspaper oh what.
Yes so in order to get to to contact you.
Oh she wrote into the newspaper asking.
If she probably told her story about her.
Son and how he was bullied and he goes.
No and he the only time she heard him.
Laugh was when he was watching his.
Videos and so you know she wanted to say.
That they were making a trip to hawaii.
And he really wants to meet ryan and so.
The newspaper contacted us the local you.
Know paper yeah so he actually came to.
Hilo and then we got together met him at.
Starbucks i think yeah yeah so that was.
Kind of like wow and here he was in.
Curacao you know yeah this super shy.
Like it almost didn't say anything yeah.
Just like looking down the whole time.
But the real cool thing is that like i.
Don't know how many years later when we.
First went to japan me sean and will was.
It will and greg yeah we had a meet and.
Greet and he was there and he was like.
An adult.
And it was just like one of the coolest.
Things ever is like i remember meeting.
This kid and now he's like this lead.
It means hot boy he's half white half.
Japanese hella good looking good looking.
Kid tall taller than all of us and i was.
Just like man this guy's all confident.
Shaking her hand his hands bigger than.
Ours.
Was like man i remember when you were.
Little depressed kid good-looking dude.
That was cool that was amazing you know.
To have somebody travel so far just.
Because like helped him through like a.
Really hard time yeah yeah see that.
Depressed kids out there and sad people.
Gets better exactly as long as you make.
Was very you meet your idols that's the.

Even when i lived with him and i needed.
Somebody he would be like you wouldn't.
Want me wouldn't want to do it.
Most people would like jump it's a lot.
Of people jump at the chance oh yeah and.
So i was always kind of like a challenge.
Like yeah wow it is embarrassed cuz i.
Was like man you know you mount family.
Likes to be in this i don't want to like.
Inconvenience other people and then i.
Found out later after i left hawaii oh.
People actually like being in videos.

I didn't at first i was just like oh.
They're embarrassed like to be a part of.
This but yeah i took you away from the.
Topic sorry yeah kyle and i we fought a.
Lot a lot so so but i think you know.
What it's normal i mean i just think cuz.
My brothers fought you know and i keep.
Hearing it you know like how like when.
You say like well how's your kids and.
It's like do they fight it's like oh.
Yeah they fight like i think everybody.
Does you know it's part of growing up.
Was uh one of your bigger fights if you.
Were home i need over the computer.
Fought a lot over the computer yeah.
Those are you on computer yeah and also.
Our best our favorite activities played.
Computers and stuff and kyle was bigger.
You know he was older and he was a bully.
Poor thing no cuz he was so little.
Ryan was so little so i didn't know like.
How long it was going on but i remember.
One day i came home from work and then.
Ryan said you know kyle he punched me or.
Something that eyes like ran into kyle i.
Was like so mad i was like don't you.
Ever touch him i know he did later but.
You know he probably did it again and.
Again but i was like don't you ever.
Touch him yeah we we fought physically a.
Lot so when i was like i don't remember.
This but when i was a kid apparently i.
Stabbed him with a weed digger my rabbi.
Is or something you know i go we do i.
Like three years or two years old or.
Something like that so i it has like a.
Little you know you know what we figure.
Is right dad he's like a little scholar.
And then i also heard i don't remember.
This but i don't know how or what i was.
But i had to go to hospital ones cuz he.
Was the he put your arm out of my sake.
Yeah ell boy or something like that yeah.
Dislocated my arm as a good kid swinging.
I know i never liked like i wouldn't.
Back down to him like if he hit me or.
Like did something that hurt me i was.
Like i'm gonna return tenfold like.
Whatever you do if it's a pinch i'm.
Giving you like a punch if it's a punch.
I'm gonna stab you in the eye because it.
Was just like it was just like you're.
Not gonna get the best of me yeah yeah.
You're not gonna get the okay because he.
Was always like like she said he was.
Naturally good he's well as people that.
You just hate because they're always.
Good at stuff that you have to work hard.
For you know yeah like for like judo and.
Stuff like he got we both play second in.
The state but like he did not train.
There's i mean he trained we went to.
Practice but he didn't train like all i.
Trained yeah you know for like.
Everything i worked really hard compared.
To him but he was just naturally good.
And that was the most irritating thing.
In the world to me people who like and.
There's you know people like that i'm.
Sure yeah that's me yeah you were yeah.
You're a good example you're someone.
Who's naturally good at a lot of things.
Which makes you lazy super i'm pretty.
Much kyle.
So mom kinda was the firstborn thing no.
I think it's your your personality like.
He was so laid back yeah but if i was.
Laid back i would be so bad at.
Everything.
He was just mastering everything nobody.
Think like as a second child though it.
Makes you more competitive yeah you see.
The second child is more competitive.
Because they see what the older child.
Did want to be better.
You and your sister were like are like.
Best friends yeah but we didn't get.
Along a couple of times too she took a.
Lot of things for granted like she would.
Take for granted me driving her around.
And stuff.
And like she wouldn't like care about me.
Or anything i remember as a young kid.
One time i don't know if i told this.
Story here i tell this story a lot.
Because it's probably my favorite one.
But we were in the backseat of a car.
After a soccer game and she was sleeping.
And just had her mouth open and she was.
Like sleeping look like that and i was.
Eating eating an egg salad sandwich and.
I saw her and i just put a big.
Egg egg on her tongue as she's sleeping.
And then the car hit a bump at you oh my.
Goodness well no the best thing was when.
Kyle went away to college i think then.
It got better hmm.
Is that when you feel like you started.
Really connecting well that's we never i.
Mean we didn't become like close like oh.
You guys are we just didn't fight so.
Naturally we started getting like we.
Could be in the same room before like we.
Couldn't really even but i think even up.
Until then you guys didn't really hardly.
Talk and then i left then it was like at.
Least they could like talk or play games.
Together.
Before i was like don't play with each.
Other don't even talk to each other i.
Was like yeah but now you guys are like.
Pretty close yeah yeah i guess i mean.
Yeah yeah much better.
That's real convincing it's not like i.
Go to you know i like some siblings.
They're like best friends and yeah tell.
Each other everything.
Like i don't know what he did for the.
Past month like i'm sure you went to.
Work but like i don't know i don't call.
Him lived in the same house he didn't.
Even talk to    yeah i'd be like.
Where's kyle it's like i don't know and.
Then i find out like kyle is in his.
Bedroom like it's like just a different.
Floor you know like and i think more so.
Boys and just a personality's like.
They're not stalkers you know yeah so.
Texts now is the best thing hmm do you.
Guys have a family group text no no.
Remember my dad he's gonna listen to.
This he still says if you have an issue.
Just text me really he really can't text.
But he knows how to make outgoing calls.
Now i will say that do you want to get.
Into some twitter cues because there's.
We actually answered a lot of the.
Twitter questions will you.
You use some a lot of those as your own.
Questions no giving them credit these.
Are things that i had take all these.
People's questions because i study my.
Guests.
Okay this is a interesting one because i.
Don't even know it from jordan the anime.
Dude what is ryan's first word oh my.
Gosh i don't know.
See i don't that's why i don't know how.
Come parents you know you know i bet you.
Remember kyle's first world no so.
Usually you keep like baby albums you.
Know you just biome at a stationary.
Store or whatever and then you fill in.
All these blanks like you know first.
First word they walked you know this.
Kind of thing and i know kyle's one is.
Pretty filled out the second child you.
Really get um i think you're so busy.
With the wit like you having two kids.
That the second child i know you have.
Less house probably more exciting cuz.
You're first and you have time yeah like.
Your first car you take probably take a.
Lot of pictures of your first car your.
Second cars like i already had it the.
First significant and i know that baby.
All album is not fully complete okay.
Well i janna kim asks what's your.
Favorite embarrassing thing that ryan.
Did as a kid favorite embarrassing.
Favorite embarrassing yeah you know if.
It was embarrassing i don't see it was.
My favorite we have a favorite story.
Nobody it what was embarrassing is but.
We have it in your book you know where.
He taught the kindergarten teacher like.
He would actually like contest what she.
Would tell them to do you know and so.
That was like so embarrassing i mean i.
Think i don't know how many parents go.
Through this but normally you have like.
A 10-15 minutes is a long parent-teacher.
Conference mine was like almost 50.
Minutes and i live zero-five-zero yeah.
Kindergarten trouble.
So much to talk about oh my gosh.
Oh i don't recall i wasn't in that.
Meeting even if i was i was a big.
Kitchen yeah i don't know how many.
Parents got to go through that.
Kindergarten button and was like almost.
50 minutes embarrassing but i do.
Appreciate that teacher because she.
Really was patient with him like whoo.
Yeah oh yeah she's still alive i think.
So i'm not sure but she's like listen to.
The podcasts excuse me yes i am well at.
Least i care to ask but yeah she like.
Really tried to understand him and.
Wasn't like the kind of person that.
Would be like you know you go talk to.
The vice-principal you know what i mean.
Yeah like push it off to someone else.
Yeah exactly like just like you know my.
My my son is was like that you know.
She'd be like no you know we just have.
To treat him like he's an old man in a.
Little boy's body because we would like.
Contest her like if she would say.
Something like if it was to sit on the.
Floor and then somebody else is not.
Setting up floor he'd be like well how.
Come they're not sitting on the floor.
You know he'd be like contester and so.
Um you know it almost sounds like a lot.
Like a lot of people look up to ryan and.
They see him as an idol but as a kid.
Growing up until now like super.
Troublemaker super adhd not paying.
Attention almost like if you saw him.
Growing up you'd be like this kid is not.
Gonna make it you know they're gonna end.
Up selling drugs and like not having.
Anything no but you know so i kind of.
Look at it as you saw he was so strong.
Minded that whatever he decided to do he.
Was gonna like do it you know so he.
Decided like he was gonna do well at.
Wrestling he was gonna do well if he was.
Gonna do judo he was gonna do do it do.
It well i'm not so sure about basketball.
Though cuz you really hated and he.
Really was not good well the thing is.
With judo i was awful at it right my.
Whole like pretty much until like i.
Would say high school yeah high school.
Eighth grade cuz i hated it but i did my.
Whole life i should be good at it but i.
Was like pretty awful and then in high.
School i had fun so i was like oh this.
Is.
And then i just became good i just tried.
Actually try but then but and then all.
The techniques came back right yeah that.
Knowledge kicked in and then yeah so it.
Was good a nice i do remember like.
Growing up and stuff like going because.
We'd have to go to tournaments being in.
A club yeah and i would like just not.
Even try but that's a strong magnet part.
Like if he was like i'm not gonna care.
He didn't care but if he was like i'm.
Gonna do it good he's gonna do it good.
You know so he could be he was like his.
Worst enemy to me yeah you did judo for.
A little bit i did as a kid and i my par.
You week i actually got second in states.
Oh like you know not like high school.
Club clubs and then um i remember i did.
Not like it cuz i would have a lot of.
Headaches as a kid so getting thrown.
Around my brain would rattle in my skull.
So i'd always get like headaches after.
Practice and i told my mom i didn't want.
To do it and she was like it's not once.
You get your blue belt you can quit so.
Then that's that's when i tried super.
Hard yeah well we had the same agreement.
But mine was black so the agreement was.
You had to do a martial art this is like.
From like young time you have to do a.
Martial art and you have to do a team.
Sport so it was like okay if you don't.
Want to do basketball then you go to.
Soccer it was like no i don't want to.
Soccer okay then you don't want to do.
Basketball you do baseball no i know.
Into baseball okay then you gotta go.
Basketball you know and so then it was.
Like okay you don't want to go judo then.
You gotta go cut a tape but you start.
From wiped out oh okay no it in yeah no.
So it's kind of like that was kind of.
Like kind of the rule dang i kind of.
Want to go into one thing but we should.
Stick to the twitter questions well just.
Go we can always come back to alright.
Okay cuz i guess talking about that you.
Know in the parenting aspect and you.
Know it seemed like you had kind of like.
A set goals that he had to accomplish.
And you know he was completing these.
Goals and stuff.
Earlier you also talked about how as a.
Parent you know sometimes you want your.
Kid you want your kid to be happy doing.
With what they're doing right so i think.
For a lot of kids especially who watch.
Youtube and you know maybe they want to.
Go into a creative field or they want to.
Go into a field that isn't necessarily.
Approved by their parents what.
Suggestions do both of you have to these.
Kids where they can prove like oh you.
Know this is how i can convince my.
Parents to go into this field that i.
Want to go into you're saying you're.
Talking about you're asking what do you.
As a kid do you tell your parents to.
Convince you to let you do youtube as a.
Career not no not youtube a creative.
Field.
So cuz you know a lot of people be like.
Oh i wanna do youtube those kids are.
Dumb but like some people want to do you.
Know like maybe they want to have a plan.
You have to have a plan like and then.
Like she said give them the warnings.
Like okay well you know most she would.
Tell me all the time because i from a.
Young kid age before youtube i'll be.
Like oh i want to be an actor and you.
Know what she said she said oh she's.
Like she didn't say oh follow your.
Dreams she was like you know there's a.
Lot of starving actors in la i was like.
Okay i'll do the singing.
What you want you sang a lot i didn't.
Want to be a singer though i just used.
To sing a lot and she's like you're not.
A singer to a certain degree and this is.
Just being around singers like junior.
And david and you know it helps to be.
Our own singers they teach i mean i'll.
Never have a singer's voice but i can do.
Enough to like i understand it more it's.
More of a science i mean not it's not a.
Science but like there is some science.
Yeah yeah that i didn't most people.
Don't really know about but besides the.
Point yeah i would say have a plan give.
Them give them all i'm saying for my you.
Can give your perspective but i think it.
Helps for her too that the fact that she.
Told me like okay this is what you're up.
Against you might not if you make it.
Great most people don't there's like a.
Point something percent chance in the.
Entertainment field at least for me.
Going to be a actor or a entertainer or.
Some sort it's very rare to really blow.
Up right to know that.
Get that information from her it it.
Helped me because i'm like okay if i'm.
Gonna do this i gotta be like committed.
To it and like i already know like if i.
Don't want her to tell me oh i told you.
So you know so you got to commit to it.
And i think knowing the if she's like i.
Mean no offense to other people who are.
Like this but if she would if she were.
Just like yeah you know what you could.
Be an actor if you work hard and you.
Just do it right like which is true but.
Be i think it's just being realistic.
Like a lot of people work hard it.
Doesn't mean you're gonna be successful.
In entertainment you might even be good.
At it but it doesn't mean you're gonna.
Make money yeah you know so if you're.
Willing to live poor or if you're.
Willing to live all these like mega.
Negative things that come with it then.
Yeah by all means but if not you could.
Just don't don't go in thinking you know.
Be yeah be realistic that's all i would.
Say and you know a lot of times i think.
It's like opportunity but opportunity.
Zone you're like it's timing and it's.
Like being ready right and so i mean i.
Related back to ryan it's kind of like.
You know he was like doing youtube and.
Then opportunity came to make money and.
So he was like fortunate you know what i.
Mean so there's that one quote that's.
Like luck equals like preparation plus.
Opportunity right for sure you know so.
It's all timing so i remember a father i.
Was like oh what's your son studying you.
Know he's in college and he said oh i.
Forget he was studying like music you.
Know and he was like yeah you know he's.
Studying music i don't know where that's.
Gonna take him and he's in california.
And i was like you know you never know.
It's like if that's what he loves i mean.
Who knows right if he has that.
Opportunity and he's ready.
I mean doors might just open you just.
Never know so you just gotta encourage.
Them to be successful in whatever.
Whichever way they go of course you want.
Them to be a little focused you know you.
Want to jump from like okay singing.
Acting okay you know what i mean so at.
Least you want them to be a little.
Focused and then so that guy is.
Definitely selling knives right i mean.
You never know.
So well i haven't talked to the father.
But i remember his name is bruno.
Definitely silly.
Bruno actually aside from when he was.
Young yeah he was like ready you know.
And then opportunity it sounds like the.
Opposite of inspiring like podcasts but.
It's you know you need a sense of really.
Like i mean i'm we're not saying hey.
There's no chance the odds might be slim.
But like again you work hard enough even.
Sometimes people who work their ass off.
Right it pays off in different ways it.
Doesn't always mean it's gonna be the.
End result you expect like you if you.
Work your ass off it's gonna pay off in.
Some way it might just not be the exact.
Way you think it is because if just.
Statistically it's not realistic.
No but if everybody that worked hard.
Made it in that industry then nobody.
Would have made it because it's all the.
Same everybody's you know yeah yeah.
Because like if i'm completely honest i.
Didn't work hard most of my life and.
I've found myself in a very fortunate.
Situation and i'm like along with you.
Guys and stuff and i forced you to work.
Hard yeah forced me to work hard now.
Yeah but you know you're ready right i.
Mean like you you have like skills and.
Then they would then there was this.
Opportunity a little bit but if you.
Didn't have like that experience you.
Wouldn't be here yeah that's true too.
Cuz you did do things before that i hate.
That even for me to like a look at it.
And be like okay yeah he understands.
Like you've had you not made any videos.
And just came like and asked to be a.
Part of this i would be like who the.
Hell is this guy yeah you know so there.
Is something there and even with your.
Personality and stuff like that's you.
That comes with you'd like doing some.
Hosting things that you weren't always a.
Great speaker i don't think without.
Having to build that up it's a skill now.
I was always a great speaker like my.
First word was actually a paragraph by.
William shakespeare but in all religion.
As a kid i was a i did theatre and stuff.
Really yeah that's right like you put in.
Some work right yeah i'm sure that.
Helped you did a lot did a lot i never.
Did theatre i hated i actually don't.
Like public speaking at all i hate.
Speaking in front of people you just.
Hate the public that's not wrong that's.
Not i don't like being in public likes.
Being in private yeah i mean i like that.
Segment because that's actually.
Something that you know a lot of people.
Are curious about and i think a lot of.
Listeners especially younger or people.
Who are trying to find themselves and.
Don't really know how to appease their.
Parents you know it'll help them i think.
Well you know parents worry right of.
Course because they want the best yeah.
They weren't the best they want them to.
Be successful they want them to be able.
To earn enough money to make a living.
You know what i mean so parents have a.
Lot of fear for their kids but something.
You just have to look like if they have.
The talent or the passion you know you.
Never know i mean who knows right like.
We didn't know ryan was gonna be this.
Far i mean we didn't plan for this.
Not at all i think i'm just i think a.
Lot of people need to understand you.
From the parents perspective is their.
Kids are considered like an investment.
Is that because you know i put so much.
Money into this bird into my offspring.
This person i care about that i want.
Them to succeed in the way that i see.
Because maybe they don't have the.
Perspective or the openness to.
Understand that they're oh there's.
Different ways that you can make money.
Especially with the internet nowadays.
And so if you were to explain that and.
Like you said like have a plan show them.
How you can do it how you can actually.
Have a revenue and be a financially.
Stable and like what your 3 5-year plan.
Is yep it helps oh yeah so that's still.
The guidance part yeah you know what i.
Mean yeah and i still think a lot of.
People once they see a lot of people.
Don't realize they don't see the work.
That goes in like you look at basketball.
Players and say i want to be a.
Basketball player they get millions of.
Dollars they you know live have like the.
Nicest clothes nicest cars everything.
They see all the things you know that.
Basically they see the rewards and they.
Think that you know they know it's hard.
Work they might be good at basketball.
But you don't really see you know if you.
Really should have map out what your.
Plan is then you kind of it becomes more.
Real let me do it from a from a youtuber.
Perspective a lot of people what they.
What they tell me especially like kids.
That.
I've encouraged like oh yeah do what you.
Love do if you want make youtube videos.
Make them a lot of them will make i.
Would say videos for about a month maybe.
Two months and they realize holy crap.
This isn't easy like along with other.
Stuff i have going on in my life like i.
Just don't have time but that's like if.
You want to be committed youtuber you.
Got to dedicate your life to it at this.
Point you know and people don't don't.
Realize that so when you say like put.
Together a plan like how are you gonna.
Be successful you got to do your.
Research like ask a youtuber what do you.
Do every day like a the one that you.
Want to be like and most of them will.
Tell you like oh they're either filming.
Everyday editing or they had to build up.
Like how did you get to where you were.
It's never the story that people think.
It is it's a lot more work than people.
Think it is and until you try it for.
Yourself that's when they realize like.
Okay this is not what i want to do or.
This is too much and i think those.
People are the people that actually like.
Respect they find a newfound respect for.
People who are doing it yeah even if you.
Don't like what they're creating you can.
Still be like you know they're working.
Hard yeah it's a lot of work i mean like.
I when i mean like when people first.
Started doing daily videos i mean there.
Was one guy even when i started we did.
Daily videos and i was like this isn't.
Not content like this is just i mean at.
The time it was new it was like i don't.
Want to see you walk to the mall like i.
Don't care obviously there was an.
Audience for that and there still is.
More now than ever.
But you don't realize even for me as a.
Youtuber was like oh yeah i could do.
That every day until you do it and you.
Realize holy crap no you can't even take.
A day if you're a daily vlogger you.
Can't take a day off even even like you.
Know i don't know how often pewdiepie.
Posts pretty much every day i know he.
Shoots a lot in one at all at once so it.
Kind of spreads it out but just the fact.
And now he has a lot of help but in the.
Beginning he didn't have the team that.
He had you know he had to work on that.
And put in all that time and effort and.
You don't you don't really see it.
Because you don't see all you don't see.
That side yeah people think are videos.
But if they're five minutes long took 10.
Minutes to make you know you don't.
Realize how long it takes to film and.
Edit and write and everything that goes.
Into it but i mean smart people know but.
A.
You do it it's really hard to just say i.
Think you know if i as a parent if i saw.
Like a child like you know your child.
Working so hard and just like improving.
And i mean i mean that comes with talent.
Too right so then you recognize that and.
Of course you want to support it you.
Know so i think that's what you got to.
Do if that's what you want to do like.
Prove it then exactly prove it yeah less.
