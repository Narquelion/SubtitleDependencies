Hey guys so this is not gonna be one of.
My typical videos on this channel and.
The reason for that is because a good.
Friend of mine in general marley's.
Actually not her but her boyfriend.
Julian gave me a call and told me that.
He's gonna throw a surprise birthday.
Party for her and then we got all.
Excited and said hey let's throw a.
Performance for her not thinking how.
Long that would take to create and and.
Learn and then also we'd have to perform.
It being that i'm not a dancer or a.
Performer of any kind but here's the.
Twist it actually became a much more.
Difficult challenge than this was.
Supposed to be a little over 24 hours we.
Have to create a performance create the.
Music for the performance learn the.
Performance get the props get the.
Costumes drive ourselves to la get gemma.
