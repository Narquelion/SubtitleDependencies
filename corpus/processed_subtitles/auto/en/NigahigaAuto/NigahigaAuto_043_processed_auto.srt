So we get dumped by someone you cannot.
Feel like not very confident so you want.
To gain confidence back by cheating.
Something and the reason why a lot of.
People think stock markets gambling.
Because they don't have a specific.
Strategies and we have about two.
Schooling that is over two million.
Already welcome back to another episode.
Of off the peel podcast.
Music.
All right today we got david in the.
Moderator seat we got i don't know why i.
Started dancing this right next to me.
I'm ryan and we have a very special.
Guest and also for the first time ever.
All a sponsor of today's podcast mr.
Steven ducks he's young 25 25 years old.
Like just very recently who basically.
Turned $27,000 correct me if i'm wrong.
Yeah into four million before the age of.
24 and you're 25 right now 25 right so.
Five million dollars yeah so five-minute.
Dollars in well when did you start start.
When i was 19 officially that is.
Critical in five years basically five.
Six years million bucks a year for.
Something like that summer it a good.
Yeah and that's why i'm intrigued but.
But just just because i've kind of.
Butchered your whole story and what you.
Actually do i'll let you explain it okay.
So it's gonna be a little bit different.
And compared to other stock brokerage.
Not a lot of structure here is apple.
Music.
Tesla amazon's all those stocks or.
Options that guys here pretty much all.
The time not a tv but what i specialized.
I trade is the stocks are have a lot.
Lower market caps which it means the.
Stock worth a lot less compared to.
Amazon's and smaller ones smaller.
Companies right and i'm just just as a.
Disclaimer for everyone out there and.
And for you stephen we're gonna have to.
Have you dumb this down a lot for us.
Because we're not experienced in this.
World so even just what you just said.
Yeah i'm like kind of following well.
We'll ask you though okay so you do you.
Deal with more like smaller stocks and.
Not like the big company the big.
Companies exactly that so what does that.
Mean exactly when you're saying you're.
You trade ok so there's about three.
Sections of what i typically categorize.
All the market caps so three sections.
One is billion dollar cap which you.
Includes amazon's and tesla's or all the.
Bigger companies then after that we.
Follow with under 1 billion so will be.
Anywhere around 500 million to one bit.
In this category is called mid cap so.
That.
Little companies and kind of big are not.
Roofs with an example of one of those um.
That's a kind of big company they most.
Of them are biotechs so they're making.
Medicines okay.
Testing their drugs and getting through.
Free one first two and then finally get.
Their fda approval so majority the.
Stocks are sometime there's all types of.
Right types of stocks you can't be valid.
Tax it can be technology companies and.
Stuff like that and after that we follow.
With anywhere between twenty million to.
100 million so that's where i trade.
That's considered small that's.
Considered small yeah is there anything.
Smaller than that like yes there is some.
Of company only worth about two million.
To 10 million and they're in the stock.
Market yes buy and trade you can buy and.
Trade they're typically nasdaq and the.
Bigger companies are there in your.
Exchange then if there's a lot of.
Smaller companies there will be in pink.
Sheets so just three have you heard.
About pink sheets from the wolf of wall.
Street yes pink sheets are very sketchy.
Laughter.
They made the movie yeah okay so.
Generally when you hear about pink.
Sheets are pretty much garbage companies.
And there's that back in twenty sixteen.
Twenty fifteen or a little bit early or.
Twenty twelve there's a lot of people.
Are pumping dump the stock so they're.
Sending out all types of emails saying.
All this that's gonna go up and very.
Similar to awful wall street and except.
They're doing the emails instead of.
Phone calls and now that people just buy.
The stock and the instead ofwell dump.
The stock and all the investors lose.
Money so the pumping means that a lot of.
They get a lot of different people to.
Buy the stock and then the stock price.
Goes up up up up up yeah and then they.
All sell it because other people are.
Like oh it's doing really well let me.
Put some money into it the average.
People right and then and then it they.
Dump it because and then they all sell.
It and then it drops the price right.
They don't really sell it so let's say.
As an average person i don't know.
Nothing about stocks and somebody sent.
Me an email this thing's gonna go up to.
A couple thousand percent well of course.
I'm interested so at first i'm gonna be.
A little bit skeptical i'm gonna buy it.
At one.
And stuccos to files oh i missed a lot.
Of prophets so i'm gonna add more.
Putting more money into it and when star.
Goes to 20 and that's where the people.
Inside the stock they're holding a large.
Amount of shares and they sell the.
Stocks so when they sell i'm stuck.
Because i can't sell anymore if your.
Stock is already down 50 percent 70.
Percent it's not gonna go back up so.
It's a scam it's a scam.
Yes is that illegal yes i remember in.
That movie i thought they were doing.
Like illegal things.
Okay so pump and dumps it is illegal a.
Lot of people get caught basis and yeah.
It's very sketchy so house opens sorry.
Yeah no no i'm just wondering i'm trying.
To because i'm that's based off like the.
Movie and it has it like a negative.
Connotation around there right yeah i'm.
Trying to figure out what got to tie you.
Into that okay what do you describe what.
You do and dumb down as much as you can.
Okay so what i do is i i study their.
Methods of i used to trade pink sheets.
Almost 50 times out of mana trades and i.
Will study the market makers so people.
Are inside the stock and i will study.
Their methods well they see and what.
Time would they dump so i will go into.
The stock they pumped up before and i.
Will see there's gonna be a specific.
Pattern now when they see yeah they were.
Dumped the stock and so i basically want.
To short the stock.
I will go against us the stock going up.
And the more the stock goes down the.
More money i make so when a decides to.
Dump the stock one day and i'm shorting.
I will make money instead of losing.
Money by buying stock so when you say.
They are these people that you like do.
You know like where they they are or who.
They are no i have so yours but there's.
A group of random people who have like a.
Certain pattern in the way they trade.
Sell and buy yeah it was shorting me.
Shorting is basically the opposite of.
Buying so when you buy oh at one.
Daughter you sell at two daughter you.
Make money but we are shorting you.
Shorting out what two daughter buy it.
Back at one dollar okay so you actually.
Go against you don't go for.
Don't go ever ever no no interest about.
10% of the time do you think it's safe.
Is that is there a reason for that is it.
Safer okay so a lot of people ask me.
That question so shorting we are going.
Against a stock let's say when the stock.
Goes goes from two to five we are.
Showing that - you're actually losing.
Over a hundred percent of your.
Investment because you're shorting i -.
It goes to four or you losing one person.
Goes to file more than that now if.
You're buying in stock if stock goes to.
One to zero.
You only lose about 100 percent and.
That's it you can't lose more negative i.
See that's the risk of shorten now.
Shirley requires a lot of methods risk.
Management how do you manage your risk.
That's a whole different area for me to.
Cover but if you have a really good risk.
Management shorting does have much more.
As compared to going mom especially on.
These small cap stocks right because.
Generally the reason why they're small.
Caps because their fundamentals are.
Really bad so they're basically when so.
When stock goes in when the company goes.
Public and the reason why they go into.
Public because they need money they need.
People that you buy the stock days and.
Can do offering to raise money for their.
Projects when you have a really small.
Company you need money to grow your to.
Grow your company that's why yeah well.
Before we get more into like exactly how.
You do things i kind of want to know.
Like just the origin like so i mean i.
Have a fact here that like and i said it.
Earlier you took $27,000 and turned it.
Into 4 million before the age of 24 yeah.
How well for one how did you get the.
27,000 to start okay because a lot of.
People be like well that's easy to do.
When you have so much money just a lot.
For a lot of people right yeah how did.
You get it to start and then also what.
Got you into this okay so when i was 19.
I think i was uh i was one year later.
And compared to other people because i.
Took one year off to narang where were.
You i was 13 so change students and camp.
Here took a one-year of just learning.
The language then go to high school.
In cincinnati then going to the college.
Cincinnati.
Yeah how did you learn the language.
Though like we just taking classes or.
Were you watching light no i had i had.
An american girlfriend and i had.
American host been me so wow that's what.
Were they he just kind of picked it up.
Yeah but why cincinnati like it's old.
Yeah folks i supposed to go to bigger.
Cities and there is a bunch of at that.
Time because there's not a very good.
Relationship between the worlds china.
And american it's just starting to.
Establish more exchanges going back and.
Forth so that program was just initiated.
And not very long ago then that time now.
Nobody is very very familiar and that's.
Where a bunch of skinny people comes in.
And it can take because it because the.
Chinese parish doesn't really know.
English you know take advantage trigger.
Vantage of it that's why that's how i.
End up being cincinnati yeah wow okay so.
Again you so you started with the.
$27,000 yeah.
Is that just family might like how did.
You get how did you start off with that.
Amount that's not an easy amount to.
Acquire for the average person yes and.
At that time i think i was working at a.
Dorm in in the school so i was taking.
Night shifts because all the morning she.
Forgot to take other people so i was.
Basically working around 12 p.m. like a.
Literally just working a regular night.
One more than a nine-to-five but working.
A job and saving yeah they pay me a lot.
More so that's why it took me about a.
Year to save them save that amount and.
Plus some of that like i would say 70%.
Come from the job 30% come from the.
Parents okay and they spotted you a.
Little bit not spy me a little bit it's.
It's part of the tuition oh is it yeah.
Okay yeah okay so that's so you saved up.
You had this.
$27,000 and what just what made you be.
Like hey i think i can do this stock.
Thing like what did you get into it okay.
So i was in this engineering project and.
I had the idea of building a generator.
And that time i were studying.
Nanotechnologies so well the professor.
Comes and say well well we don't have.
Enough to but we don't have enough funds.
To fund the project and that's where i.
Think about whoa we need some fun so i.
Better just go and make some money and.
Also uh that's how i also got dumped by.
My girlfriends i was a little bit.
Motivated to to make money to make.
Changes well can i i mean if it's too.
Personally enough to answer but is it.
Money related or is it just like i'm.
Gonna show her it sounds like the.
Facebook movie like story doesn't it.
What's the reasoning i mean are you.
Bringing that up so so we get dumped by.
Someone you cannot feel like and not.
Very confident so you only gain.
Confidence back by cheating something.
And that's why i want to achieve.
Something insignificant and that's.
That's why i just decided to get me the.
Stock market because at that time as.
Exchange students you can't really work.
And you can't really invest because you.
Don't have a correct identities so.
Anything can do is to trade the.
Exchanges you can't do that oh wow did.
You just.
I mean you understood stocks before no i.
Have no i just looked into it so i just.
Started on youtube and watch people.
Expanding what the stock market is buy.
Some books stock for dummies yeah so i.
Was trading so a node etf which is it's.
Not a specific company so it's basically.
It's every day has volatility going up.
And down so it's basically trading that.
But every day is only moving about one.
To two percent so i wasn't making that.
Much money but i see the potential let's.
Say if i invest $500 i can make twenty.
Five and thirty dollars per a day.
It makes me feel good right because you.
Came up a little bit yeah so that time i.
Wasn't making $15 $13 an hour but you.
Can make $30 in a couple of minutes.
That's not considered really good so.
After that i was looking for more.
Aggressive income and i took a look of.
Add to the smoke cap market and i saw.
There's one stock went from i think was.
One.
120-some home ridiculous like that and.
Basically every often they will have one.
Star going from one to sixty one to 50.
That's a couple thousand percent gang in.
Only two days right so i was trying to.
Think how they can capture that and.
That's where i started to get into the.
Market i'm trading right now mm-hmm.
But when you say that i mean i'm sure it.
Always looks very like oh man i just.
Missed on something so big like that's.
Also trap in itself don't you think yeah.
Yes it is.
That's called fear of missing out it's.
Conformal yeah okay hat i mean it.
Happens there's a reason why it's almost.
Like gambling right there's a reason why.
People keep putting in money and and.
Going hoping they just get lucky but.
You're a process isn't based around that.
My process is not based on that at all.
It looks like gambling it's not gambling.
At all and the reason why a lot of.
People think stock markets gambling.
Because they don't have a specific.
Strategies and you can if you think.
About a lot of hedge funds like for like.
Goldman sachs and bigger hedge funds.
They're winning a hundred million dollar.
A day and they're winning 90% at the.
Time so they're opening 228 trading 220.
I think was 200 trading days or.
Something ridiculous and their gains are.
Significant more than their losses right.
They have a system yeah a system they.
Have a our algo system or computer.
Trading or some type of high our.
Long-term high winning percentage.
Pattern or high strategy they're using.
For a while so well there's gotta be.
Something like that.
And it's very similar to industry right.
Now on pretty much every single industry.
Either is youtubers or really stay.
People or people do in south america.
There's only 10% people can be extremely.
Right as full right so pretty much the.
Same laws and a lot of people are.
Thinking of stock market it's now for.
Them but it really depends on how much.
Work you put into but i mean like in the.
Stock market it's a little different in.
That i feel like if you and all these.
Other companies are winning so often.
Yeah that means there's a ton of people.
Who are constantly losing yes so those.
People.
I mean there's the there has its like.
Energy right there's it doesn't money.
Just doesn't appear yeah has to come.
From somewhere so these people that are.
Losing in a way i mean like if everyone.
Starts winning and if you're giving away.
I mean your whole thing is you want to.
Help educate people right yeah wouldn't.
That affect your own business no there.
Are so many people right i mean i don't.
But in theory right in theory if all.
These companies if everyone starts.
Catching on basically what you're saying.
Is there's always gonna be dummies oh.
There's always a be done yeah and that.
The you what like what is your goal.
Essentially right now okay so my goal.
From the very beginning is i started.
When i was a newbie i was a newbie and i.
Didn't get that many help from people it.
Took me about one year looking at the.
Market consistently eight hours every.
Single day without non-stop even the.
Holidays.
Well holidays i was studying for.
Statistics but and it took me a while to.
Really figure out what's working what's.
Not working so if i can give this to.
People and that can help all younger.
People that when i want to have their.
Dreams it will take much less time for.
Them to achieve their goals okay so i.
Have a question though the way that you.
Came about it it's just like your.
Ability to recognize patterns that you.
Feel like give you a lot of success or.
Is it something that almost any person.
Can see it's pretty much everybody can.
See if you're a nerd what to do so the.
The way i come out all those patterns is.
I will track about a thousand samples.
And up one specific pattern and i will.
Calculate how many times doing how many.
Times do i lose now will show me what.
Say if you trade this pattern for three.
Years ninety five percent can wink i.
Presume can news and well i would take.
That trade all day and you favor peers.
Your peers and also attract a frequency.
A frequency of the patterns so how many.
Times they haven't per year so i can use.
That frequency times how much reward i.
Can make on each trade i can simulate.
Again of how much money can make for a.
Year mmm and this pattern that you saw.
And you're studying is it something that.
Was already.
I just figured out and previously talked.
About is it something that you kind of.
Pioneered some of the strategy a career.
Day that by myself some of you are.
Already there from the books and stuff.
You read yeah okay there's there's so.
Many different patterns and techniques.
You know there's a lot of different.
Companies that have you know different.
Strategies and they sell their their.
Sale they sell their strategies yes kind.
Of like what you got you guys are doing.
As well what's what's a differentiator.
Between your strategy and all the other.
Thousand strategies that are out there.
Okay so when you are search on internet.
Says how to trade that will penny stocks.
How to trade micro cap stocks wait when.
You when you searching there's gonna be.
A thousand people come up and you don't.
Know where to start and so i think the.
Very fundamental thing you need to look.
At is people's track record.
Do you have account statements laying.
Out does this person show you see is he.
Consistent profitable for the last five.
Years and if he is not then it's not.
Somebody wanna learn from and other.
People just showing their cars no people.
On youtube showing their cars houses to.
Lure people in to buy their program but.
They don't really have any official.
Track record mm-hmm that's called.
Lifestyle marketing and i hate that.
Button right but you have some stuff.
That you kind of brought with us right.
That like explain to me what we're.
Looking at because that this looks crazy.
It looks like you're making a beat or.
Something okay okay so the green number.
Right here they realize so this is how.
Much i made today sorry real quick if.
You could just because we have some.
Audio listeners so maybe this is a.
Program people can oh yeah okay so you.
Want me to talk about the program like.
What's it about what you're talking.
About okay so this is my brokerage.
Account this is a trade 0 it's the.
Brokerage out there that specialize in.
Small cap stocks and this is the.
Platform which i look the stock for and.
Well generally you don't really need a.
Path on your own all you need just the.
Platform to trade then it's just a.
Program people can download there's a.
Program for free uh no dad how 3 how.
Much the program's cost $7,000 so.
This one cost about $200 per month.
This one cost about $90 per month no.
There's a trade zero this trizzie oh.
Yeah okay you don't really need this one.
All you need just this one you just need.
The trades are you okay ninety thousand.
Per month yeah so right here you can see.
By sale shore and cover so by the battle.
Style sale you sell style he's sure to.
Controller stock when once you finish.
Shorting you want to cover all your.
Positions so we're going to take a.
Position in shorting your position goes.
In negative.
We're buying your position goes positive.
So it's literally the opposite and right.
Here that's my account number so you can.
See it's xd use of ducks and and they.
Realize 33,000 today that's what you.
Made today that's what i made in profit.
Not in tours that in total that's in.
Profit so you made 33 grand today yeah.
Is that normal.
Pretty normal yeah on average you make.
About 30 grand a day not averaging 30.
Grand a day but it really comes and goes.
You know can't really tell.
I think 30 grand every every three days.
Hmm so some some biggest lost days.
Biggest last days for me will be seventy.
Thousand well i think it's mean that i.
Only take that loss is pretty much about.
Two three times a year and the biggest.
Gain that made is two hundred thousand.
Three hundred dollars today and so i.
Guess with a this is an automated.
Program or do you have to put in.
Specific numbers in what you want to do.
According to the patterns yes this is.
What do you want to do specifically.
Let's say we want to short stock at this.
Time then you click short mm-hmm and.
It's not 40 holloman air can't recognize.
Patterns and god yeah and why do you use.
This program versus cuz i have some.
Stocks as well i mean i'm not a date.
Trader but i use like a trade.
What's it what's the biggest difference.
Between a trade and a software that's.
More looks a little more complicated.
Okay so i'm gonna give a very.
The painting about brokerage out there.
Yeah and you guys hear about probably.
Interactive brokers e-trade robinhood.
Probably most popular and robin hood i.
Don't like that the way you see.
Everything is free but when you're.
Buying a stock especially for beginners.
They're taking your entries so basically.
They say you bought at one and they will.
Execute you add 1.05 what i mean.
Executing at 1.05 so when you want to.
Buy at one daughter but you actually.
Bought at 1.05 mm-hmm so all that zero.
Point buy for them belongs to robin hood.
But i thought robin hood is free yes.
Free.
Yeah it's company to three trades right.
When you buy it they were taking money.
From tax yes i could tax.
Yeah so they actually charge you behind.
The scenes on your profits yes if you.
Get yeah now when you get profit no it.
Doesn't really matter we can get profit.
When you lose it will still take partial.
When you sale hmm yeah also we again.
Take fire showing use mmm in or so they.
Win all the time that's why i don't.
Really like robin hood but it's i mean.
Yes the reason don't really like a robin.
Hood now follow three trade interactive.
Brokers the one i like the best they do.
Charge a very small amount when you are.
Buying certain amount of shares but if.
You have a really small town they say.
You only have a couple thousand dollars.
Or five hundred dollars i think to.
Produce the best for you follow on that.
And brokerage take dollars per trade you.
Said they would take about ten dollars.
On our trade and when you place the.
Order in the total amount it should take.
Ten dollars no matter how many shares.
Your trading mmm some of the broker you.
Take 0.0004 and per share so so the.
Reason right now that you're kind of.
Doing like this podcast and you've made.
Other appearances in other youtubers.
Videos and stuff like that is because.
You're trying to get yourself out there.
So that you can kind of i guess promote.
The fact that you're kind of being you.
Want to be a teacher.
Those aren't degree like you gotyou.
Offer courses yeah to teach people like.
Us we know nothing from the very.
Beginning how you can get started in.
Doing something like this correct yeah.
And you really believe that you're not.
Special.
That in terms of like you need you.
Averaged um person like me or paco you.
Could learn something like this if we.
Took your courses yes okay yeah i know.
And just because i quit i quit you know.
You know i didn't bring in david i'm its.
Mark yeah but so people like i mean.
Obviously this sounds like just seeing.
That number oh you made 33 grand of.
Course i'm interested of course.
Everybody who hears is interested but.
Naturally the skeptic in me the skeptic.
And everyone is like yes so this sounds.
Too good to be true this guy seems shady.
Not that i think you're shady.
But you know why should people take you.
As legitimate like why explain does what.
Makes you different from your average.
Shark or the things they see on the big.
Short or the things they see on wall.
Street you know okay so the thing is a.
Lot of people out there as i said the.
Very fundamental thing is they don't.
Have their track record and i have about.
I think i have my verification on.
2018-2019 and because a lot of people.
Did have a very very skepticism so like.
They they doubted me that i actually.
Turned twenty seven thousand into nine.
Hundred thousand within a year and so i.
Replicate that performances in 2018 by.
Auditing my calcium and say every single.
Month to a cpa firm and i did it so if.
You guys are a lot of people are skip.
Ilysm they can look at my account.
Statements and you put that out there.
Public yeah yeah and that cost you money.
To do as well it cost.
Yeah they cost a lot cause like 50k.
Sometimes even every time you do an.
Audit every year yeah oh wow.
It's expensive to audit that's just.
That's six days of works okay and also i.
Also review the one of my count.
Statements that for the maximum.
Performances i turned forty one thousand.
Into three hundred thousand you know.
Martha so now i guess um also with your.
Cuz how do people learn your stuff is it.
A online courses or book it's an online.
Course online course and about how long.
Does it take or is it like you.
At your own pace so typically will take.
About a year year and half to pretty.
Much no other strategies and getting.
Settled in your head so it's almost like.
A trade school in a way yeah when you.
Say a year and a half is it doing this.
Everyday for a year and a half doing.
This pretty much study about at least.
Two to four hours a day okay you've got.
Something that we're like what you did.
Is work pretty much holiday to save up.
And then study for like a couple few.
Hours so going to school and then also.
Yeah it's pretty much the same pretty.
Much very everything that you going to.
School or going getting good at sports.
They take you right how long have you.
Been giving out these courses i've been.
Giving out for a year almost two years.
Now and have you had people yes succeed.
And have you had people fail good angry.
Customers yes we did so we have at least.
20 students not it's already over at.
Least 200,000 and we have about two.
Students that is over two million.
Already in a year or a year yeah and we.
Did have customers that they won't speak.
Spanish so like they can't understand.
The course that's yeah but is there.
Anyone who took it and they just didn't.
See results and maybe it's because they.
Weren't studying or maybe they weren't.
Doing it right but like there has to be.
People who like it there's no way you.
Have a hundred percent track record it.
Not 100 percent tracker as i said a lot.
Of people they don't really put the work.
In right failed and they have very angry.
A lot of the 20 people how many roughly.
Do you think so 20 percent i would say.
20 year of 120 out of 100 yeah kind of.
Like didn't so it's a pretty good.
Percentage 20 out of 100 are doing well.
Or not doing well 20 out of hundred are.
Doing very well.
Mmm do you well then probably 50 out of.
Hundred okay yeah yeah that makes sense.
Because i mean so so this track record.
Right i mean some would say that oh why.
Isn't it 90 percent right but what.
You're saying is that even though.
Somebody can purchase your class it.
Doesn't mean that they're studying it.
The right way is that is that how it is.
Or is it that they're not starting off.
With enough money.
Or is it i mean i'm sure it's a variety.
Of reasons yeah there's a lot of people.
That they just had kids and the bottle.
Cords and having get into a burner.
Because i do live trading webinars to.
People i've trade in front of them.
And they don't even come to the webinars.
Yeah and that's how they failed quick.
They wanted they bought it because they.
Wanted to make money quickly as opposed.
To just wanting to study actually really.
Apply it yeah well a lot of people that.
Just come in well stephen hubbell just.
Give me your alerts and the william bio.
Just buy the same thing with you you.
Can't do that because what happens and.
When i just go off i just want to trip.
I'm at home i don't want to teach.
Anymore you're not self-sufficient and.
It's not gonna help you it's the whole.
Like teacher man or give a man a fish he.
Eats for a day yeah.
Teach a man to fish he eats for his life.
Yeah and also i feel like they're lazy.
The the fundamental of the program is i.
Won't teach them to be self-sufficient.
Not being and to put in the work because.
You did yeah you have to earn it you.
Can't just copy notes yeah yeah so.
Essentially and then going back to kind.
Of i guess skeptics you i mean you.
Clearly make a ton of money daily yeah.
Why charge for these courses if the.
Whole goal is to get these people to do.
Obviously i get it it's a business in.
Itself yeah is the goal to because this.
Business you think could be way bigger.
And it also helps people or is it like.
You know i mean it's kind of it's kind.
Of strange to the average person like.
You're making this much money why you.
Need to charge why not just upload.
Youtube videos yeah add you upload a lot.
Of youtube videos for teaching people.
And everything is free out there and.
Also the reason why i charge people is.
That they want to feel something is.
Important when you buy something that's.
Super expensive you think is important.
So that's why we just give stuff for.
Free they don't really care yeah yeah.
Yeah and they don't take it necessarily.
As seriously yeah true okay well we're.
At our half time right now so we're.
Gonna take our quick shishi break and.
We'll be right back all right or do you.
Have a special talent oh yeah we do that.
Now can you tell us a funny joke or can.
You sing is there something do that.
Halftime show performance anything you.
Want to do i'm really good at gaming but.
Yeah i guess we'll just cut to an hour.
Games.
A live stream will come back we have.
Some personal questions for you as well.
So i think it'll be a little interesting.
Yeah we'll be right back and we're back.
So what do you have here okay so this is.
My brokerage account statements you can.
See starting day it's december 20 on.
December 1st 2018 ending period is.
December 31st also this is what you were.
Talking about earlier about having proof.
Of your track record that most people.
Who give advice to basically do this.
Don't have yeah okay so this is a.
Website and you can call it your.
Verified if it's real or not and this.
Listeners it's trade 0.30 kol.
Yeah so this is a mag well i don't want.
To show my account number but this is my.
Account number and now the only thing.
You need to pay attention to is you can.
See right here.
Net profit right net p and else and.
That's net profit and you can see on.
This day made one hundred twenty one.
Hundred seventeen thousand this day lost.
Six thousand this day lost thirty five.
Thousand the study made twenty nine.
Thousand and overall forum for a month.
And made about two hundred fifty five.
Thousand that's one month it's one month.
Yeah wow.
So the days you lose like 30-something.
Thousand you don't even that's not even.
A drop in the bucket.
Yeah and it's its base as part of it.
It's part of it so it's not like it's.
Like you made a good bet and get a bad.
Name if you ask any legitimate traders.
You can't really win every single trade.
Right now possible so so that's why you.
Had to start off with twenty seven.
Thousand because without enough capital.
Well i mean i guess you could bet really.
Low right you can't ya because so i mean.
In general what what let's say someone.
Only has a thousand dollars okay it's a.
Five hundred cuz he said number but you.
Are making and losing between what like.
Five and twenty dollars a day yes pretty.
Much like that and then you'd and that.
Was enough to get you like how did you.
At what point did you take that was it.
Gradual gradual growth because that.
Seems like.
Big leap in such a short amount of.
Time okay so when i was treating with.
The $500 i was losing there and there.
And once i got into the small cap market.
And that was tracking statistics so.
Because i was an engineer everything is.
Based on statistics so that's why i use.
The engineering method into the stock.
Market and they want to track this one.
Specific patterns.
Well how much well when i trade how much.
Money can i make.
What's the percentage of reward so after.
I check that was 20% and that attract.
The winning percentage was 85% so each.
Trade i have a eighty eighty-five.
Percent win chance and the twenty.
Percent of the world that can make.
Thousands of the same trade again again.
And again then that's how i verdi's put.
More money so when you were just getting.
Started i mean assuming these people.
That are taking your courses and they're.
Trying it for themselves.
Yeah they're not gonna be as good as you.
In the beginning yes right so you have.
To i mean i'm sure you've had a lot of.
Losses more so than now in the beginning.
Yes how were you able to convince.
Yourself like this is i'm doing the.
Right thing you know.
Okay when those losses were happening so.
When the losses are happening a lot of.
People so well as a human nature and.
When people take a loss the instant.
Reaction they will feel is i won't make.
This money back so yeah so i want to.
Make the money back they will make.
Emotional mistakes that's how casino.
People lose money exactly yeah and now.
The reason why you trade in stock market.
Because there's a wall there's a edge.
For high only percentages 70 percent 80.
Percent even the sixty percent can still.
Make money in your honor wrong wrong and.
When you are taking a loss in the single.
Into my mindset is so i track this.
Pattern and i do have 15 percent of.
Losing percentages and when i lose.
Also your mind i will know how much.
Money i can make per year because i know.
The frequency of the pattern or.
Riskreward of the pattern how many.
Times it happened per year and and i can.
Use that to simulate again it can make.
About five million dollars a year and in.
My mind i know i can make five million.
Dollars a year if i take a one loss it.
Doesn't really matter.
Is walk away and come back again so it's.
More like a long-term it's more like a.
Long-term investment instead of like.
Looking at right right right.
Wow how many different so like for.
Example yesterday how many different.
Companies are you trading are you.
Focusing on like one company or are you.
Inputting like a bunch of money into it.
Or are you kind of spreading out amongst.
Like a thousand companies and putting.
Like a tiny bit in each one okay so this.
Is where you want to pick one stuff so.
You want to trade and now typically when.
I look at the market i want to look for.
Everything that has volume that means.
People are other people are looking at.
It as well so typically market opens at.
30 i wake up around 900 and just.
Generally take a look at the overall.
Market and what stock is hot so one.
Stock is up about or 50% already so a.
Lot of people will have eyes on it and.
That's very generous volume that's the.
Stock that will pick the volume is the.
Amount of activity going on between.
Buyers and sellers yes mm-hmm.
See so the higher the volume it means.
That most people like a lot of people.
Are tricked there's a lot of activity.
Which means there's more potential for.
Ups and downs.
Well it's and downs and that means.
Volatilities yeah so up and downs and.
When you there's more people trading.
There's more newbies kim right because i.
Mean in general like and in a way you.
Can't really feel bad because those are.
The people who weren't willing to put in.
The time to study yeah and and really.
There's those are the casual gamblers.
Like going to vegas with money yeah.
They're not gonna play the odds they're.
Playing emotion yes yeah i guess i.
Understand that it's easier to because.
You don't have to see their faces yeah.
It's not like at the poker table yeah.
You know he has the money i was waiting.
You know.
Okay i understand that so you don't.
Trade like stable stable stocks yeah i.
Don't really trade staple stock i want.
To trade something that can move 70.
Percent 100 percent thousand percent on.
The day so the stable ones are the ones.
That are more for long-term would you.
Say the stable ones are yes for non term.
For swing trades or something index.
Family what's a swing trade it's being.
Traded is you are holding four positions.
For a couple month a year so even a.
Couple months you consider a long.
From trade yeah instead consider no.
Because you do it what by the day i did.
A yeah yeah so take us to your everyday.
Like you told us something early i don't.
Know if it was on the podcast or right.
Before but you work like two hours a day.
Yeah obviously in the beginning it was.
All day yeah and for now at your level.
And your success rate you wake up at.
00 you can start at 930 you're done.
30 yeah most actually and most of.
00 i want to stay.
About 30 to 45 minutes and then what do.
You do go to la you know get a haircut.
So get into your personal stuff.
Apparently we just heard before we.
Started this that you're you made it to.
A competition in starcraft you're huge.
Gamer starcraft 2 david and i both used.
To play that not nearly as good you made.
It to the top 64 in the world yeah at.
One point i was in the wcs champion the.
Championship he was at wcs so we're.
Serious war series championship oh you.
Were in it how far did you make it i.
Think it was made in road of 64 and i.
Lost in the road of 64 oh my gosh that's.
Still crazy i guess you know what when.
You have that kind of money and then.
You're just like i'm gonna get good at.
Starcraft so you buddy star crap every.
Day yeah is this before or after you.
Started this is before actually when i.
Trying to develop the stock market.
Strategies i used the sorceress.
Strategies because it's more almost like.
Same message same psychology counter.
Strategies you want to counter people.
With that doing mistakes.
Yeah making me say if you were going the.
Meta which is like buying stock yes then.
You're going counter meta yeah so people.
Are buying battlecruisers you're getting.
Anti-air yeah your minds okay so okay so.
It's to you it was almost like common.
Sense yeah okay interesting and you see.
Something you can basically we never see.
A certain action.
You will know why they're building you.
Can do you need to against it it's just.
Very much a psychologist right right.
Right.
You're interesting gaming doesn't just.
Create gun violence.
It creates money so i have a question.
Here so i you know a lot of people say.
They look up to you know the advice of.
Warren buffett right yeah as a very.
Successful trader mom you know something.
That i did read somewhere that warren.
Buffett said is that if you you know.
Take your paycheck and you take a.
Percentage of it and you invest it into.
A fund or the sp500 it has a history of.
You know it's an uphill slope yes with.
Some dips in between but from the very.
Beginning of the stock market it's.
Always been an upward trend yes so he.
Was saying that you know if you put your.
Money in there eventually you will make.
Money and it'll compound and it'll make.
Even more yeah and and so that's like a.
Long-term kind of mindset right yeah do.
You do you believe in i do believe it.
Yes when you invest into us being from.
500 or going to in this index pounds you.
Do make money on long-term thank you.
Five years ten years but you don't.
Really make aggressive income and what.
Percentage do does that generate you.
Would you say oh i don't really know 20.
Percent 50 percent maybe it'll be more.
Than that she's pretty good over a long.
Period of time period of time but when.
You look at anything i trade twenty.
Seven thousand into 1 million by already.
Account statements that's that's that.
Presumably over 20 percent.
It's thousands of percent yeah right so.
I mean ever since so it's been about.
Five years five six years of success.
Yeah right how has it changed your.
Confidence i mean like you said you kind.
Of started this because of your ex like.
I mean there's no i'm sure a part of you.
Is kind of like you know yeah how do you.
Take us back to where you are now like.
To that scenario that first collect you.
Start like how do you feel are you like.
Over that are you like do you keep in.
Touch with her like what's this one say.
I'm pretty much over it.
Okay well that's good but as she hit you.
Up hey steven hi rise up you have higher.
Standards meeting you up though that's.
True i mean i'm sure you've seen it.
People know you have money and you're.
Making money and naturally just in.
Anything anything you become famous you.
Make money you're naturally gonna get.
People coming after you there's gonna be.
People who want something from you.
Including girls yeah and she hasn't hit.
You up since she did once but oh yeah.
But that doesn't mean it was just for.
Money could be but i mean how has it.
Changed your life i mean obviously i.
Don't know i actually don't know how was.
Your everyday life now that you work.
Those two hours that's not trying to get.
At what else other than gaming how does.
It change your life really change.
Anything my life i love cars and they're.
Just bought cars and nicer car once you.
Try six-month and get tired of a generic.
Honor i don't think your personality.
Changes and they're losing you fly to la.
30 times a year yes private jet.
Sometimes no nope every day okay because.
Cincinnati doesn't have a private jet.
Yeah okay well i mean like a like i said.
That might change cuz you're only at the.
Four million more or five million mark.
Right who says in five years you won't.
Be what six exponent no what are you.
Projecting in five years i don't know.
Because there's a synonym you can make.
On micro cap stocks.
You can't exceed 20 millions a year yeah.
So thinking about you think that at the.
Rate that you've been you know i don't.
Know maybe it's consistent you hit a.
Plateau where you get a million a year.
Or has it been like twenty dollars then.
Making a hundred dollars and then a.
Thousand then then thirty thousand like.
Yeah what's your projection the.
Projection is i don't really you don't.
Really want to do this forever.
You always want to like spray your.
Folios really stay which i just a couple.
Properties don't want to go and once you.
Have all the proposals they all generate.
Any money and so on and and these.
Courses - it's a business in itself get.
Enough people then you don't even need.
To do this and the reason why i start.
Courses is.
You guys all know packing like a year.
Ago through a year ago lot of people are.
Starting lifestyle marketing i don't.
Know if you guys notice courses yeah are.
Showing you houses but there's like that.
One guy on youtube tai lopez yeah yeah.
Yeah it's all my stuff marking where is.
The track record and why do dad show us.
The track record well i mean i think a.
Lot of those i never i was just annoyed.
By those ads i just be like this guy is.
Such a douchebag anyway i would look at.
That i don't feel like it would get.
People's attention you're right but then.
But then are they legitimate they might.
Be don't know yeah you don't know but.
But you're going the route of like.
Here's transparency yeah and i'm sure.
There's gonna be people who the people.
Who are mad at you who are gonna speak.
Out against you yeah but if you have the.
Proof you have the receipts then i mean.
There's nothing you can really say and i.
Think that's important to be transparent.
I think it's very important yeah okay i.
Think it's one of the most important.
Yeah before you start teaching people.
Because if you don't know what you're.
Teaching then you're teaching that run.
The wrong thing and a lot of people.
That's not right yeah right okay i mean.
Do you so you do you enjoy the teaching.
Process would you say you're a better.
Teacher or a better try see my cuz when.
I teach people because i attract a lot.
Of more younger generations so a lot of.
People are gamers and funny people and.
We have our own common languages so it's.
Actually yeah it's a do you enjoy.
Teaching yeah and then you feel.
Obviously so how exactly just to give.
You a rough estimate how much are these.
Courses some of the courses or if.
They're super beginners to start yeah to.
Start like $90 come on okay so it's a.
Good subscription service yeah like.
Anything else like almost like going to.
I mean i guess a really cheap college.
Yeah not considering not calling what.
You do a college but that's kind of what.
It is is you're taking a school right it.
Depends on how what i well how deep you.
Want to go of course is i mean but do.
You think i mean how many courses are.
There like do you think you have to.
Finish it to get to where you're at.
Yeah i would say.
There's about well it's not how many.
Courses is about how many live webinars.
And i do and you watch me trade i can.
Pretty much do the same thing i'm not.
There looking up in the morning and make.
Sure execution goes good and doing your.
Own statistics it's the method i see.
It's like learning how to do it yeah and.
You have a lot of videos online you said.
Right yeah so what differentiates that.
From the classes like what makes.
Somebody go you know i think i should.
Take the classes because these videos.
Can only offer so much or is it is like.
A way more intense dense because i so.
Youtube videos are more general.
Beginners for people that just want to.
Get in the market and they don't know.
What even stock market is and you can.
Listen some general opinions and what.
Should you or should not do.
Find your voice on beginning mistakes.
There and there but if you really want.
To get into pattern statistics and real.
Convince courses that just teach you the.
Patterns then yeah i'm saying that's.
Where the paid courses come again yeah i.
30 so.
We got a watch to just do it yeah howdy.
Here right before after yeah i wish i.
Would have just seen it just to be like.
Oh okay.
It's like that not that i would.
Understand how to do it just as like.
Visually just see you do it yeah and.
Then be like okay let's do the podcast i.
Just made 30 grand so cool would you say.
That a majority of your income comes.
From trading versus like your your other.
Business with the teaching trading.
Accountant of trading makes more money.
And compared what percentage probably 70.
Percent 80 percent yeah mm-hmm it's not.
The service is not started to i want to.
Make money from people.
Yeah yeah it's not dedicated in that.
Yeah but i mean eventually i mean if.
You're putting in the time to build it.
Out and and run it yeah you have to.
There has to be some read it's not a.
Charity.
Yeah right so i mean it makes sense it's.
A business at the same time earlier he.
Said he wants like when you pay for.
Something now give it worth so that's.
What it's true yeah true that's mainly.
What it's for yeah yeah yeah well i mean.
That's interesting we have some.
Questions from fans okay you mind.
Answering here we have one from ji young.
Here when do you believe the next.
Financial downturn will happen and.
Should we wait to begin investing until.
That happens kind of like what i guess.
Warren buffett does right yes but when.
It was really cheap and then yeah.
So there's because when i trade while.
Micro cap stocks they don't have any.
Correlations being on well compared to.
The entire market so when the market.
Goes down we rub it doesn't really.
Affect this affect the stock what i'm.
Trading so that's something that you can.
Be really safe to learn to trade and.
Also you can learn how to really trade.
In on terms so financial process happens.
Every 10 years so we're at that mark.
Consistently consistently yeah okay so.
It's coming soon soon yeah so i mean but.
In your it's almost the opposite for you.
Right all right correct me if i'm wrong.
But you're waiting to people over invest.
And then you short right you don't go.
Against that yeah so you're not waiting.
Till it's well i guess it would be at.
The same time right when the market is.
Bad then more people invest is that how.
It works okay let me give you examples.
It's very easy to understand okay and.
Okay let's start from the beginning so.
When it stopped when this stock is going.
Up the first time and a lot of people.
Are telling your friends okay well.
Invest in stock the stock went from it's.
The new tesla and stock went from 1 to.
10 and you tracked a lot of people to.
Invest the stock now well the company.
Didn't do that gun stock went from 10 to.
1 and all of your stuck at 10 so the.
Next time with stock bounces to 10 go.
Spectacles to 10 again after 2 years you.
Guys are tired of holding and the stock.
Goes back to 10 i was short a because.
You guys will sell you guys don't want.
To hold out that's one more pattern that.
You've recognized but when i'm shorting.
It there's still people buying at 10.
Because they think always gonna be.
Potentially break through 10 and that.
Time we trap will trap new people into.
At 10 right.
And when stock goes against the time.
Again will cause a certain chain.
Reactions will.
Keep coughing are you like coughing is.
It very rare that you're wrong about.
That like let's say something it is the.
Next tesla lately it yeah like how often.
Does that happen to you one not a 50.
Very rare yeah so we're betting the.
Percentages so this kind of happened.
With bitcoin right wait what's your idea.
Like we remember when there was such a.
Big i mean i'm sure you know it was such.
A big thing we crypto right yes it was.
At i think our friends were like oh it.
Was at well i don't remember them didn't.
20 he was really yeah but it was like a.
10 when i was super popular and then it.
Went up to 20 yeah and people were still.
Buying along the way even our friends.
Were buying her on like 10 went up to 20.
And they were still holding on to it and.
People were saying it's gonna come back.
Down it kind of did it did i was.
Shooting it but okay.
Yeah so you you i was being part of it.
Yeah yeah it's same thing and so what if.
Though and people still believe we have.
Friends who still say bitcoins gonna be.
The future what if it just keeps i guess.
A it's just a pattern thing like you're.
Assuming it's never gonna come i'm not.
Assuming it's never gonna become big but.
I think about like this so at that time.
Back in 20 i think it was 2017 yeah so.
The big one when there's a huge hype.
About it and understand the industry of.
Pretty much everything 90% people do.
This morning so when 90 people for some.
People trying to buy something you're.
Trying to be cool against it so that's.
How you make money i see now since since.
It was a huge hype and there's more.
People are trapped in it so a lot of.
People holding 15,000 16,000 17,000 even.
Though 20,000 when that goes back to.
20,000 again other people will sell it's.
The same psychology right so first to.
Recover from that many back holders.
Which people are holding the bag we.
Don't looking to sell i will take years.
And years so for the next couple of.
Years the investor will be fighting the.
Pack holders for a while so you right.
Before this you mentioned breaking ten.
So are you saying breaking 10 because 10.
Is a whole like a good number like a 1 0.
And then like 2015 or yeah so the first.
Time when stock arel i'm not gonna short.
It because i want to know where the bag.
Holder is i want to know where to start.
Drops once they trap enough back holders.
Everyone know or at this price before.
Looking to sell and we go stop rise and.
Short sell it.
And people when they're people well when.
People are trying to buy it at ten there.
Will be new people traveling again so.
Will cause a chain reaction next time.
When people trying to buy again i was.
Still short selling and then mm-hmm do.
It again and again again no always make.
Money mm-hmm until the day i'm.
Theoretically on to the day that it just.
Keeps but blows up until the day that we.
Were saying even then it should come.
Back down well until the day breaks ten.
Yeah then now we'll cut at ten fifty.
Then we just lose fifty cents out of ten.
Dollars talk i see right oh i see okay.
There is me so i'm just trying to follow.
Everything in my head yeah it's like.
Yeah it's such a new concept right i saw.
You nothing about stocks i think if i.
Can under i kind of understand but i.
Think if i can kind of understand i.
Think a lot of people listening will.
Know a lot more know people say that a.
Lot you know he did like the one with.
Andrea i was like what does he not know.
Anything on this show yes we i need.
Things dumbed down but i did a great job.
I think i understand this a lot more and.
I think i appreciate the fact that.
You're being very transparent even.
Though as a skeptic person myself i.
Would personally be like well how do i.
Know what i'm looking at because this is.
Confusing and we're taking it from your.
Words so if i had somebody verify that.
Doesn't know you been like oh yeah this.
Is legit i would probably believe it.
More but i'm not i'm not questioning it.
I'm yeah and i've met you now and you.
Seem like a very straight up dude and.
You play starcraft 2 so that helps.
There's like a certain connection there.
And i i don't know i think it's it's.
Definitely interesting and it seems like.
You genuinely want to help yeah and yeah.
I mean if you're gonna i wouldn't.
Personally i don't know enough to.
Encourage anyone but i think if you're.
Interested we can find steven where can.
They steven duck sitcom so d steven dux.
I com qx i okay yeah steven ducks eecom.
Okay cool um did we miss anything well i.
Mean we do have a couple more oh yeah.
Questions.
Yeah so eric wynn has a question and.
It's like if you gotta be combined with.
A lot of other things too but it's just.
Like i have a 9 to 5 job that requires.
Me to have my full 8-hour attention but.
I really want to trade and make a profit.
Yeah do i have to trade hourly  daily.
In order to be successful okay so.
There's two strategies i'm teaching why.
You can be a full-time day trader one.
Thing can be a part-time day trader but.
Right now i'm leaving on part-time.
Because i only stay about 45 minutes so.
As long as you can all take your time.
00 try it until 1000.
Then you're good just what is it every.
Day it's pretty much every day is there.
A way you could do like does it or does.
It just not work this way that you do.
Follow your stress is your strategy.
Based on you have to be there every day.
A strategy is based on you have to be at.
Least 30 minutes every day every day.
What if you did like a week straight and.
Then you skipped a couple days and then.
You win another you can still skip yeah.
So you can you can't skip camus a day.
That doesn't ruin your strategy oh no.
Okay well what about whatever at like.
The beginning though you know when.
They're just starting to learn because.
Some people aren't gonna be able to just.
You know do what you did and or aren't.
Brave enough to necessarily just give up.
What they're doing and commit to this.
Full-time right yes so if you're not.
Really committed to this beginning i.
Don't really recommend people to.
Recommit time for to learn these.
Strategies to learn the industries you.
Need a year of learning repetition yeah.

Mean a lot of this seems like pattern.
Recognition is pattern recognition.
Something you can learn or is there.
Something like it's it's like math where.
You can learn the formula you can learn.
The formula okay so it is like a math.
It's like it's not like writing we're.
Like you have some people are creative.
And some people just there's an answer.
It's 80% math 20% i'll say sick ha.
Judgment judgments okay yeah in the.
Psychology part refers more so to.
Whether that day you want to like you.
Feels more selfish.
Yeah sometimes you feel more greedy.
Sometimes you want to make more money in.
Sometimes well if you.
Take a loss you want to make you back.
Here so it's it's more about discipline.
Right so that's what you were saying.
About like people make emotional.
Decisions and your whole thing is don't.
