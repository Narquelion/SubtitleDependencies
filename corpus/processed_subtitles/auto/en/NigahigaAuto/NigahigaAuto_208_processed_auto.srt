He punched his uh his monitor and the.
Cameras on the monitor so just you see.
Him yeah oh man what's wrong with your.
Face today they said to even in person.
One one month two people were at it and.
It was like one person would donate a.
Thousand and then it was two thousand.
From the other guy and then three does.
It i was like what is going on.
Should we clap for the cameras clap yeah.
Yeah this is how we've been starting.
Every single part yes.
And we just cut to every angle okay so.
Welcome back to another off the pill.
Podcast we have two very special guests.
This time we have david and half ooh.
That was a good sound effect we're gonna.
Put something in like a little clap or.
Something i just did put in the sounds.
Of our claps just barely anyone clapping.
I mean you guys can talk about who you.
Guys are like you guys are from the.
Streamer world that's how i want to.
Describe it from my understanding.
David is a professional i can always say.
It wrong but i say her heart the stone.
Not hearthstone not hearthstone players.
Hard to play but and paco said you're.
The number one player in the in north.
America yeah or is the world on my.
Ladder ranking yeah right now it's crazy.
And then ha fou from my understanding as.
Well is the og streamer streaming before.
You know all the little kids hopped on.
Whaley was it twitch was it always.
Twitch that you were on yeah twitch for.
Six and a half years now wow how long.
Has twitch been have you been never the.
Song i started like eight years ago i.
Was looking at the top trends i'm 16 oh.
Wow for the people who still stream now.
I'm sure they're long yeah yeah yeah for.
People who are still streaming now i'm.
Like 16th oldest.
And dig pride in that is that good we're.
Just oh yeah we've been doing it for so.
Long do you know anyone i don't think.
Probably not but do you know any other.
Streamers that are just completely.
Different you not just give their names.
How do they do it though for so long.
Because you have to stream for hours i.
Think some people have a persona and i.
Think they stream less so a nice dream.
And if i do like a 15 hour stream by.
Hour 10 i'm not talking yeah zombie mode.
That's my leg just like people don't.
People love it right they're still like.
I mean they're probably there with you.
Just chilling some people you know if.
They have like a persona that they have.
To they have to fulfill and i mean.
That's even more entertaining to watch.
But that's not all twitch is right like.
There's a lot of different things you.
Can do right right right right that's.
Well said do you guys think that um.
Ninja is authentic or is he i mean have.
You met him yeah we getting into it i.
Mean i'm just that's the first person.
That came to mind cuz he's like the.
Biggest person biggest one on twitter.
Yeah i think i worked an event with him.
A few years ago but yeah i think he's.
More or less the same but obviously you.
Give it a little bit more and i watched.
Too much of his four-night stuff because.
I don't play for tonight right um i.
Think i think he's more or less genuine.
And or like very true to his his normal.
Self i don't think he i mean you can.
Also have to like filter yourself a lot.
But like not a lot but like a little bit.
Right like you can't be being like super.
Vulgar if you feel really angry you.
Don't want to like portray that right.
Right so you kind of have to like filter.
Yourself a little bit and try to get.
Yourself in like a better mood and yeah.
It's just don't think that would be fun.
To like if someone i really liked though.
Got super mad when they lost it anymore.
That one streamer what's his name well.
Yeah tyler one rage is like a shroud who.
Like punched his camera no no those are.
Out that was something.
Samet he punched his uh his monitor and.
The camera was on the monitor so just.
You see him he's another one like the.
Really old streamers oh yeah i think.
That's been on the platform for a long.
Time and he's kind of always been.
Themselves that's how he is canada.
Summit rage see that was like my biggest.
Fear even for doing stuff like this i.
Always felt like you know even vlogs i.
Have to be so like hey guys like right.
Energy that's how youtube was and it.
Just always been my style and it's.
Exhausting like nothing just talking.
Like this you could do this for a long.
Time i don't feel like if i had to put.
Up that that kind of energy for i.
Couldn't stream for like three hours.
Even yeah i mean that definitely makes.
Sense you're acting yeah that's it is it.
Is or super over exaggerated yeah if you.
Like strained out if you do that yeah.
Yeah but i don't know most at least me.
And maymay are a lot of streamers.
They're just kind of like hang out and.
Play games i'm curious are you guys have.
You ever did myers-briggs the.
Myers-briggs test we took it for each.
Other i'm steven s are you funny are you.
Guys what what all right do you remember.
Uh i know i'm like super extroverted.
Yeah you can see that remember i'm the.
Thing for the entrepreneur i'm like.
Close to that or the entertainer like.
One of those two and then david was i.
Don't know i think we're like inf i.
Thinking that you are an i that's why.
I'm curious because that's usually.
Basically introverts get tired from.
Having to be around people i guess but.
The because you're not you are with.
People though i am with people that i'm.
Not with yeah right like i feel like i'm.
Not trying to like entertain i'm just.
Kind of like being there right like it's.
Like watching tv you can't really get.
Drained by watching tv so there's hope.
See it is possible to be introverted and.
Stream streamer i thought it was like.
There's no way introverts would last.
It's too exhausting for them yeah i mean.
It's a form of interaction yeah you're.
Interacting with people to a certain.
Extent so mmm-hmm.
But well the the reason why i guess it.
What's kind of ingrained in me because i.
Learned really a lot when i was a lot.
Younger.
I guess high school time doing doing.
Videos and blogs and stuff like that if.
I wasn't that character like if i wasn't.
On and like happy everywhere i go in.
Blogs people are like why are you such a.
Dick why are you so mad right now i know.
This is this is my face all the worst is.
When it's like are you sick but yeah if.
You don't make a bun yeah oh man what's.
Wrong with your face today they said to.
Even in person people wouldn't say it to.
You in person though no i haven't had.
That in person.
Oh maybe sometimes at school if you have.
Less makeup on we're like are you okay.
Today you feeling all right yeah well i.
Mean that's just like that just i mean.
That's gonna happen to girls everything.
Online i'm sure you have some it's.
Probably such a different experience for.
Girls i would assume it's gotten a lot.
Better especially as the gap between.
Genders in gaming has diminished so yeah.
Yeah still fine so what are you.
Currently are you still playing are you.
Guys playing the same game stone and the.
New expansion just dropped the content.
Still feels good going again yeah right.
Cuz you for a while when it was it was.
Kind of getting like i mean even you.
Guys were having a hard time saying like.
Oh yeah i want to play something else.
Sometimes but like i guess if they.
Created new cards or what they did in.
The expansion it kind of changes.
Everything but doesn't it always end up.
Being missing yeah like there's like one.
Like really good deck is that colin or.
Certain things it always ends up being.
The same thing right it takes time to.
Like figure that out and that's that's.
When it's really fun when people are.
Being creative and like you know making.
Decks and things but you're the guy yeah.
I look at the copy they copy you yeah.
Actually god is so crazy yeah that's.
Crazy and whenever i play those kind of.
Games or any kind of game i'm all on.
That guy who's gonna go with the.
Weirdest route.
Because i want to be different but it.
Never works like the smartest ways just.
To look it up and then copy what they do.
But still be more secure you can't do.
That you're having fun you're that guy.
Who actually knows what he's doing and.
Gets to have fun green the new thing is.
Yeah i'm the same way i liked writing.
Something like really weird like find a.
Mechanic in it like can i make this work.
And then so satisfied but all the pieces.
Of puzzle together and it's like yes.
Yeah so did you start um i don't know if.
You already said this but when did you.
Start streaming ah.
I started streaming four years ago i.
Think about four years ago yeah yeah.
Long time it was out of college i was.
Just kind of bored i was like myzel.
Stream what are you going to college for.
Biology degree that's pretty bad oh yeah.
Okay this sounds like me kind of but you.
Finished i did finish but i finished.
Like a year late i was supposed to.
Graduate like i don't know a semester.
Earlier but has it helped you in.
Streaming no but i don't going to.
College yeah i mean it taught me how to.
Interact with people a little brighter.
And take care of myself.
Not that i do that great of a job of it.
But uh healthy.
I mean i'm alive you know considering i.
Mean a lot like you said a lot of the.
Time you guys i don't know if we said.
This when the cameras are rolling or not.
But a lot of times you guys sit very a.
Long time er sitters they need to try.
And think of something that the somebody.
Was talking about like when you sit for.
A long time there's something really.
Dangerous about that i don't know if you.
Guys read that or not i was my entire.
Life style is terrible you guys look.
Fine like we don't leave our place to go.
To work yeah that's like i feel like if.
I had one of those pedometers mmm so.
It's called the domitor never stops ever.
Starts it would say like less than a.
Thousand.
Within like a month because from my bed.
To the bathroom to the computer and it's.
Just a cycle like that's it that's your.
Morning routine pretty much everyday.
Right most part as much as we can yeah.
Some days just want abstain yeah some.
Days you just don't feel it and like you.
Just don't do it you don't want to.
Spread that to other people right yeah.
And you just any what you have to tell.
People that oh you guys i'm not gonna be.
I'm i'm not gonna stream today i just.
Got lecture today by a so when we watch.
The nice dream line it was like you said.
You would stream today and you didn't.
Even stream and then oh no i mean i just.
Found out i'm gonna do this podcast so i.
Didn't stream and i well thank you and.
We apologize to your to your very.
Faithful fan yeah.
That poor guy was a guy yeah and how did.
They reach out to you if you weren't.
Streaming like sponsored stuff so he's.
Like almost like an assistant and say.
Okay he was like you should told me so.
Was it just waiting around i was like.
Sorry.
Wow wow that's interesting so they do so.
Oh well i guess he you guys kind of work.
Together then and you know yeah but you.
Met through like you man and there's.
Always ask people who are like in every.
Stream to help them like those are the.
People you want because they're there.
Anyway right right right yeah so that.
Really is your lifestyle then i thought.
You guys were exaggerating the last time.
We know about that.
I think people always think that we.
Exaggerate but no we are we're no life.
Yeah you enjoy it like staying home.
Right i mean i love playing i don't know.
How i've gotten away with this lifestyle.
For this long cuz ever since i was 17.
And i was like well i can't do this.
Forever but i somehow i used to be a.
Professional world of warcraft player.
Mm-hmm.
Ted i'm 27 oh my gosh but when i.
Seventeen it's just so weird thinking.
About that girl.
Yeah i feel so young but i'm old now.
Yeah.
I feel young because i've had the same.
Lifestyle ever since i was young and.
Nothing's changed.
It works i mean yeah you know in the.
Same way i mean i felt very similar yeah.
I thought you know at the time it was.
Like youtubers careers lasted maybe.
Three years once they like kind of and.
Then i've had many down years and then.
Many up years is just like oh that's.
Very fortunate but it's not gonna last.
Cuz there's always gonna be someone else.
The weird thing is that there were so.
Many more people coming to watch youtube.
That and i think it's the same with.
Twitch that even if there are other.
People getting bigger there's just so.
Much people to you know there's just.
Some part one person the actual platform.
Is growing right right so there's more.
Viewers for you so it's not like anyone.
Else is taking anything away from you.
Right exactly and i don't think at the.
Time people thought of it like if.
Someone else is big you're done but it.
Kind of was because it was like people.
Would shift over but now it's like.
There's so many people to go around like.
Everybody has their own personal tastes.
I'm sure and he can consume youtube like.
You can consume multiple people at sia.
How to say it that like one viewer can.
Watch a bunch of youtubers right it's.
Like yeah you know a five minute or a 10.
Minute segment or even if it's like an.
Hour of content week it's still another.
Just like channel channel hop right.
Right i would say in streaming it's a.
Little different yeah you can die in.
Streaming because when you die in.
Popularity it's like you're competing.
Like one viewer can open a few streams.
But they're really gonna be active in.
One maybe uh-huh and so you if you lose.
A viewer then you're you actually lose.
Oh they start watching someone else and.
Then yeah that person kind of takes over.
So that's the obligation yeah you kind.
Of need to be on like one consistently.
That sounds exhausting in my opinion i.
Don't know how it is in youtube because.
I do know that like peoples it's like.
Your total view count right is what.
Matters that well it's a lot of it is.
Watch time now oh okay that helps you uh.
You know get suggested pose and like it.
Helps you basically stay more relevant.
Um so that's why people have been doing.
Longer videos and you can also get.
Better ads like significantly better ads.
So you like double your revenue triples.
Sometimes so yeah it's it's heavily.
Based on that everyone should keep.
Watching yeah but i mean like that's i.
Mean that's one of the reasons why.
Podcast it's taken off you know and i.
Think people use youtube in a different.
Way.
And i think just in general.
Entertainment even like twitch like i.
Feel like five even like five ten years.
Ago it was it was nothing like nobody.
Wanted to just listen to other people.
But i feel like they use even for me.
Like i use youtube and listen to podcast.
Just what i'm doing other things just to.
Have somebody like not somebody there.
But like just to have something almost.
Like background noise kind of right.
Right like i'm not there watching yeah.
You're not actively watching you're just.
Kind of like yeah look it's a similar.
Thing that's kind of like the whole.
Trend that's happening from streaming i.
Mean i feels like that's like the.
Popular thing right now yeah i mean i.
Usually always have a stream on when i'm.
On my computer and i just have it in the.
Background yeah right and it's like i'm.
Never like just sitting there staring at.
Those because you're not like actively.
Watching but it's like i don't know it's.
A very passive thing for me also yeah.
See i'll have yeah you'll have someone.
In the background you're playing games.
And like oh that's interesting or.
Something exciting happens when yeah.
That's that's crazy so that is you're.
Okay so that's your lifestyle you pretty.
Much stream everyday you wake up.
Bathroom food and i know you guys have.
You you get food delivered so you really.
Have to leave your house yeah that's.
Amazing.
What was even crazier to me is that you.
Guys leave the house so little and when.
You do you brr or take a car or whatever.
Right once i was um i don't know if i.
Should tell this story know you can tell.
Me to stop once i was taking the two of.
Them home and i was like oh so wait do i.
Turn here for a little bit but it's so.
Crazy to me but it makes sense cuz you.
Guys don't need to leave for your job or.
Yeah yeah i mean i don't know the way to.
The airport and i go to the airport a.
Lot that's true i guess if you yeah.
Right you don't really need to know.
You're probably doing all this like on.
Your phone like you need.
Attention it feels really weird oh man i.
Wanna like another show on twitch called.
Analysis northernlion super show and.
They were like kind of interrogating me.
Because people finally realized that i.
Am that you boiled water and i was like.
No never done it and it's because i mean.
When i was younger we had one of those.
Like water boiler thing yeah and i make.
My instant noodles that way like right.
How i would and but yeah i mean i order.
All my food and then i also drink.
Soylent which is like a meal replacement.
Drink uh-huh and so that gets me through.
Like really long streams hmm did you get.
Sponsored yeah we have zero sponsors so.
Soylent has to go soylent yeah well.
We'll see i mean i drink it like anytime.
I'm in the long hours it's actually.
Sponsored does it actually make you feel.
Like you're uh like full it's 400.
Calories so it'll make you feel like you.
Consumed 400 calories and more.
Importantly oh man my okay this is bad.
To say but my body doesn't like feel.
Hunger anymore i just get headaches and.
That's how i know i'm hungry.
It's very strict bad because i just tune.
Out my hunger because i don't want to.
Stop streaming especially when i first.
Started because i was always afraid like.
If i stop streaming i'm gonna lose my.
Momentum you know i have to just keep.
Working because i love this job and.
That's some crazy aggression and now i.
Know i'm like over time i think for.
Everybody especially when you're on your.
Your highs you know you want to make.
Sure like i got to keep this going yeah.
You ride it right right yeah i think.
Yeah as long as people um i mean i think.
For in everything you just have to know.
Not i truly believe it's it's a balance.
To everything and not finding.
Getting too high when you're high too.
Low in your low you know one extreme or.
The other in everything.
How about for you david uh i'm a little.
Bit more well-rounded but not as much.
Especially this past year i've just been.
Working a little bit but i mean that's.
Fine i mean we just like hanging out all.
The time and yeah i don't do much i eat.
And i sleep and i scream what would you.
Do if i've got every mess it up every.
Time.
Hearthstone mm-hmm doesn't become as.
Like let's say another game comes out.
And i heard some becomes less relevant.
Yeah you still try and stick with it.
Which what would make you take the leap.
I'd probably just play whatever i want.
To play you would i think i played i.
Want to play i mean i do i do for the.
Most part like i'll put in hearthstone.
Or as long as i want to play it and then.
I'll play something else you want to.
Play dota but you don't want to stream.
It it's cause it's like my relaxing time.
Right like it's it's something that i do.
To like i don't know i get embarrassed.
But like he's very good though yeah i'm.
Like pretty good but like it's it's more.
For like myself right like there's.
Things that you do for yourself and like.
And you don't really want people to see.
Makes sense yeah but i'll stream.
Everything else yeah i don't really care.
From bad you care about your views uh.
Yes that's what i'm saying yeah you.
Wouldn't really do just like i feel like.
Your account matters because it's ours.
It's like otherwise it's not that you.
Care about like the money or anything.
Like that but it's like to be able to.
Care about it a little bit yeah and i.
Always ask people i like but you should.
Just stream what you want to stream and.
I'm like okay would you go to work if.
You got paid half the amount they're.
Like no i'm like okay well yeah yeah i.
Mean and that's the thing too is like.
People i mean you can say even for.
Myself you can say you know it's not.
About the money but you still need money.
Yeah i think i think people are.
Starting to i mean at least in the.
Youtube world they kind of get that now.
They know it's heavily involved it's.
About it's a balance like you said yeah.
You're balancing between probably what.
Your viewers want to see and you want to.
Play it have fun exactly i mean you you.
Play games with less viewership right.
Yeah yeah my numbers we're like one.
Third literally one third so i usually.
Like three four thousand viewers.
Okay so what were you playing like.
Thousand do you think it's cause of the.
Games your fire battle right i mean yeah.
They're just like less popular but and.
I'm less good interesting like we play a.
Hearthstone and people will watch.
Because of our good watch and learn.
Where's like why the hell would i watch.
His good play.
Batteries she sucks i'm sure he just did.
Like irl streaming like people would.
Still be very interested in that too.
Right because they don't get to see you.
In that realm like they don't get the.
Season every day we did a little bit she.
Did irl street my best friend we went to.
Japan and we are else named a week there.
Right.
I know it's it's exhausting that's.
Exhausting because why moving if i go do.
One thing like if i have like a doctor's.
Appointment that like stresses me out.
Like ooh bring out and going to the.
Doctor's appointment and coming back.
Michael that was my day people uh-huh.
I'm lazy you can be a lazy extrovert.
That's i look very very lazy extra.
Weight and i mean i liked i liked.
Hanging out with becca so that was great.
But just like you have to keep doing.
Something interesting you have to like.
You know go to the next place and you.
Can never just sit a lot of activities.
Right like yeah you don't think they.
Would be cool with you just not doing.
Much um maybe but that's not the point.
Of being in japan or like.
Music.
Yeah well i mean i feel like at this.
Point if they're watching you long.
Enough it can't just because you're.
Skilled like they must just like you for.
You and there's a basis of my viewers.
That will watch me play anything and.
That's why it's like the other people.
Just want to see how good you are at the.
Game or right something like that sure.
For me too like when i watch certain.
Streamers i'm watching them to play a.
Game and if they play something else i'm.
Not interested really if you suddenly.
I'm trying to think of an example for.
Youtube uh-huh if you started hmm like.
If you tried a singing career do you.
Think people would be as interested i.
Think there would be initially because.
There'd be like this is funny i know.
What you mean same thing with this.
Podcast why are you doing this but it's.
Gonna happen i mean i get it i get it.
But then you might find people who are i.
Mean like anything you know over time.
It'll build ideally they might like you.
Their streamers do variety all the time.
Right i don't think okay i'm not i.
Always say this and i'm not fishing for.
Compliments but i don't think i'm like.
The most personable person i think i'm.
Okay but i think people watch me because.
Of my gameplay and that's okay right.
Like everyone has their reef they like.
Their niche right and they have their.
Strengths and like day9 can stream.
Solitaire or minecraft yeah i think for.
Me yeah i mean like gameplay.
Yeah people watch me because i'm good at.
The game and i watch me because i'm like.
The most entertaining person in the.
World and that's fine yeah that's fine.
Yeah interesting that is interesting.
Though that's like kind of mind-blowing.
To me actually i thought it was and you.
Like a lot of people are just naturally.
Drawn to you and you can make anything.
Fun right so well not necessary i'm.
Hacked.
I've tried streaming before like a long.
Day you guys remember when um blog tv.
Was a thing no.
Okay so that was like an you stream or.
On that time it was a block tv like paid.
Basically all these youtubers back in.
The day to just stream like you don't.
Play games you just talk right ten years.
Ago right yeah and it was just the most.
Awkward things it was like a minimum of.
Like three out to three hours like twice.
A week and it was like the most.
Exhausting thing that i had to do it was.
Super awkward.
Because at the time - i didn't they i.
Don't think you could do the.
Picture-in-picture thing live like like.
Show what you're doing oh i'm sure you.
Could i just most people didn't do that.
Or know how to do that and i just felt.
Like okay i'm just not a streamer i.
Guess i'm not good at this yeah i mean i.
Think some people naturally the fact.
That you've been doing it both of you.
Had been doing it for so long it's clear.
That you guys i'm sure you guys realize.
That you're gifted at it it's not.
Something that anyone can just do i felt.
Really weird and awkward the first time.
I streamed i think that's normal for.
Anything even with youtube i'm sure it.
Wasn't completely natural at first and.
Then it became natural right like it.
Became more and more but what i'm saying.
Is i think like if you really want i.
Feel like you have the skills to switch.
To anything don't you think because you.
Know thanks after doing it for so long.
You know what people want to see and you.
Know alike you know the ins and outs of.
Street listen oh yes there's there's.
Ways to do more there's always a way to.
Do more but you like we've talked about.
The balance is like the balance between.
What you want to do and like what you're.
Willing to do for more right yeah.
Whether that's money or viewers or.
Whatever it is.
Mm-hmm so when you guys are not you know.
I mean just chilling hanging out and.
Stuff like not streaming what else do.
You guys like to do i know you say you.
Stay at home but i'm sure you like i.
Mean do you watch any of shows watching.
Shows netflix yeah that's like oh.
Marvelous mrs. mazal yeah we just.
Watched that is that it's a show on.
Amazon prime.
It's like free free amazon prime users.
But it's it's about like a jewish.
Comedian.
Cuz the girls a movie or is it oh.
Actually one thing that just happened on.
Twitch is now you have a bounty board.
Where you have like sponsor deals come.
Directly through twitch did that for you.
Probably not maybe youtube bringing us.
Deals yeah yeah yeah oh okay well now.
There's um.
I mean twitch did that before right deal.
This one's through this one's through.
Twitch the client there's a like there's.
A page you can go do and it will show.
You your rate and it'll be based off of.
Your concurrence it's like a bounty lit.
Like a list it's little bounty board.
That's funny and it'll be like play a.
Trailer for like i i did one for.
Homecoming which is like um a new series.
On amazon prime and all i do is watch.
The trailer on my stream for free.
Wow this huh have you guys seen fairy.
Tail the anime no but i i think i've.
Watched a few episodes i couldn't get.
Into it are you into it not i mean i.
Watched i got into it for a little bit.
But you got kind of repetitive that's a.
Um but date that's system is very.
Similar to that in that show they do.
Like a you have a board and you pick.
Missions requests yeah yeah but that's.
Such an interesting concept.
I don't think youtube has done that no.
It's pretty cool it's like a it's really.
Nice game deal i didn't know that you.
Did it right though you recorded it.
It'll shame you activate the bounty and.
It will change your title for you and.
Then someone else.
Well i'm sure on twitch checks that you.
Actually did it and then you do as many.
As you want there aren't that many right.
Now oh i have like five available like.
Two or one but i mean i just asked my.
Viewers i'm like have you heard of this.
Game is is warframe any good and they're.
Like oh i play it it's fun i'm gonna.
Play it when you do ads like that oh.
They don't get upset some people are my.
Viewers are better.
About it than his view but i don't do it.
Very often.
It's so crazy i would think yours would.
Be my viewers are kind of fickle because.
Like most of my viewers are from like.
I'm like usually the number one or.
Number two spot on hearthstone so it's.
Mostly just people who don't always.
Watch me they just kind of watch the.
Game of arrival they are always number.
Two or number one i used i used to have.
Like a bunch of rivals i like made a.
List of people but i want to be like to.
Rise up like extreme at certain times i.
Would try to be very entertaining no i.
Don't really care as much because i'm.
Just kind of it's such a luxury just.
Again i really need to just the best i.
Lose like a third of my viewers if i'm.
Streaming while he was streaming because.
It's like a incident right youtube.
That's i was saying before it actually.
Matters because like if you if you're on.
And i'm on and you're bigger you're.
Literally taking my viewers right and so.
I usually stream like the night shift.
When no one's around and no one wants.
That spot competition you're the number.
One person at that spot number one i'm.
Like the number two person but it makes.
Sense though so do you find that because.
You're doing that you have more fans in.
Like other countries yeah yeah no i i.
Looked at my demographics they have that.
On twitch and i'm still mostly american.
Muse kind of crazy time so what time is.
This cuz you sleep it really strange.
Right.
I try to ideally i would start around 11.
Or 12 st yeah yeah 11 p.m. pst and then.
00 or 800.
A.m. pst.
And i'm still mostly american but i mean.
I stream all i streamed every time slot.
And that you can think of because i'll.
Do like 15 hours streams then that's.
Crazy.
There's no way that i mean i'm hitting.
Every time we've learned so much i.
Should have been taking notes this is.
Like a very educate this is like not.
Even for like.
For me to learn wow we have been blowing.
Yeah you take the shishi break no you.
Guys need to let me call it the shishi.
Break no but every time you think every.
Time they say do you need a bathroom.
Break them like do i have to wait do you.
Though we could take a quick one quick.
Break quick all right she she break.
Their back heading back and we're back.
From the she she brings the she she.
Break is over hoffa was just asking us a.
A like a rope would you rather kinda.
Okay this question i really like i.
Always ask everyone and it's you have a.
100 sided die so if you've ever played.
While slash role okay and you roll a one.
You die a painless death i wonder what.
It would be if it was a painful death.
Yeah one evil a pain you you die a.
Painless death.
You roll anything else you get a million.
Dollars do you roll a painless death.
Painless death wonder how much of that.
Changes people's ante it changes my know.
What yeah i mean i think yeah yeah i.
Mean if you're not getting tortured i.
Think i would roll really yeah million.
Can you up it a little bit i mean it's.
Yeah if you want to do torture question.
Like if you would roll then it would be.
At what number would you not roll and if.
It's like if you wouldn't roll then out.
What number or what percentage what do.
You know i would do i would roll for 10.
Million percent 1 percent what do you do.
Painful then oh paint like how painful.
Are we talking talking about like a.
Stubbed toe or like it's gotta be.
Tortured i like sent a buyer painful.
Yeah yeah.
Burn the witch see that i wouldn't do i.
Wouldn't roll yeah.
One thousand two still you still won do.
It no million out do it one hundred like.
This there's gotta be there's a number.
Out there come on hard but like even a.
Thousand yeah pretty hard but like what.
Do you do one in a hundred for infinite.
Money one in a hundred painful painful.
Death you know i wanna do it infinite i.
Would probably do it infinite money is.
Infinite i would probably do it well the.
Thing is it nothing to logistically let.
People know the people know because then.
Your whole life becomes horrible when.
You have the most money that is true.
What if you just have the ability to.
Reach into your pocket and grab a.
Hundred-dollar bill and no one else.
Knows check a check check well no the.
Money you bought a card okay no one.
Knows no one knows no one knows and one.
In a hundred for a very painful death.
The infinite sign that's it no one knows.
That even the bank i don't think i would.
Limit less credit card forever it's.
Doing i would do it i would do it one in.
A hundred what if you what if you land.
On it then your dad didn't know you're.
Not just dead you get tortured but if i.
Don't everyone around me their life is.
It's over dude.
I can buy anyone anything forever.
Forever would you could but you would.
Destroyed the economy and if that's not.
Kind of it factors that come each other.
It is a lot of power see where were.
Those people when you ask those like.
Questions that we make we ruin the game.
See taxes it's a person that just says.
Yes it's just like yeah okay.
And then they're gonna be assassins.
Coming for me i could pay for bodyguards.
Does this last until i dam and the other.
Million dollar questions if you do roll.
How many times do you roll some people.
Go crazy there like hunch of time till i.
Die for a million right you get the.
Pitiful one do you get a give the money.
Away if you've like you've successfully.
Rolled it's not like i can do this it's.
Not like i want to kill you for is the.
Die right now if we had that right now.
That might convince me because chances.
Are is not gonna lie on a one i know you.
Don't have to roll the dice to know it.
One percentage but things happen man.
Laughter.
If you had the money beforehand i would.
Like go to every like religious thing.
And everything that is true actually.
Yeah i like that one that's a good one.
Yeah nobody ever heard that the.
Questioner they're like asking my twitch.
At is do you think for us it's a little.
Bit more personal do you think you're.
The smartest or smarter than the average.
Person in this room so for viewing this.
Room i thought about that same question.
Before a lot of times not just in the.
Room but just in general.
Mm-hmm and so the reason i thought this.
Was because of kanye actually and even.
Though some people might this is the.
Easiest comparison and the most recent.
Even though most people think he's an.
Idiot and he might be maybe he is a.
Genius you know the fact that he can't.
Communicate it to enough people is that.
Still considered intelligent what i mean.
Is if you're like me albert einstein of.
Our generation like say you're not.
However highnesses you're someone else.
But a genius on that level of that iq.
But nobody can relate to you are you.
Still intelligent are you still smart.
Because you.
Can't convey what what defines how you.
Do everyone smarten their own way right.
Right like you probably wouldn't be very.
Good a hearthstone right yes martin you.
A hearthstone zach but when it comes to.
Youtube content and what if them.
Actually really good everybody's smart.
In certain ways i think it's a hard.
Thing to answer but if you're talking.
Like book smart are you talking like but.
You know some people are smarter than.
Others yeah they're that you know the.
Other person is smarter see but there's.
Some people i think of and like i really.
Thought up because i have thought about.
This before like it's just dumb but he.
Has a really smart face though right.
Just like maybe there's they have to be.
Really good at something else that i or.
Maybe they're just so smart that they.
Just can't communicate to me you know i.
Mean like maybe they're just geniuses.
And they do communicate that's true they.
Could also be like really ditzy but they.
Could be a straight a student in.
Everything they've ever done i've met.
This name right so you are they stupid.
Are they smart you never know like.
There's also the people most people who.
Are those like super smart straight-a.
People a lot of times they don't have.
Common sense.
So is that dumb that's a good question.
Actually i mean the only real like way.
We have determining smarts is like.
School right it's like the grades in.
School for most people i don't know how.
Does like how do i q test work i don't.
Even know that's trainable for any test.
Yeah like you can study for the sats and.
You'll do better right right doesn't.
Necessarily mean you're naturally.
Smarter than someone yes i don't know.
Unless if that's what g if we were going.
By numbers and it's easy that you say oh.
I got a better score than you yeah maybe.
If he's got score a higher iq than your.
Brain is capable of achieving higher.
Than someone is lower that's what maybe.
That's other thing is this such an.
Interesting topic because and i only.
Thought because i was running a video.
Bulk on you and it's not not the only.
Read it was before this yeah like.
Just writing videos in general just like.
Thinking like a lot of times i'll have a.
Script that i'm really happy with i'm.
Like no one's gonna get the reference.
It's like no one's gonna get the it's.
Too it's too much like it's like you and.
I said kind of like dumb it down i do.
That's what i'm saying it's almost like.
I say dumb it down but like that's how i.
See it but it's actually smarter to.
People if i do it that way and it's like.
If i'm trying to communicate right for.
Me to put out a video that less people.
Understand minority understands it's.
Actually dumber of me even though i.
Consider to be smarter because it.
Doesn't reach or communicates it as many.
People it makes because more people can.
Understand it right be dumber if you.
Made a joke that only two people got.
Right everyone be like this is not funny.
It's stupid yeah but then it's but in my.
Opinion i might be like oh this is smart.
Because right for me this is like.
Brilliance yeah but at what point you.
Know of your genius do you realize.
You're actually dumb if you can't convey.
That stuff to them but you're an.
Entertainer that there's a difference.
When you're doing it to entertain and.
There's a difference between i mean like.
Figuring stuff out.
Yeah i mean just talk like i'm dumb when.
It comes to cooking dave i mean i don't.
Cook so i can't really but doesn't.
Necessarily mean experience experience.
Yeah like if you just because you don't.
Know how to do something doesn't mean.
You're incapable it doesn't mean you're.
Incapable but you're like dumber than.
The other person who knows if you can't.
Do something well maybe they'll isn't.
The best word so what is what is being.
Dumb then something i would say unable.
To learn i think the learning is the.
Smart play so we're people who can learn.
Really fast early the smartest people in.
The world it's it's about if you're able.
To learn and to wit to what depth you.
Can learn right you can learn how to do.
Anything but like i could learn how to.
Cook right but i could i learn how to.
Cook like you know like could i become.
That good and i think you can yeah i.
Would say dumb is kind of a relative.
Term.
Like where you are in terms of.
Learning something so like you could say.
Someone is dumb who's like just hasn't.
Learned as much as you right that's kind.
Of like what we use a hard thing down in.
Like if we're talking about us in this.
Room yeah like which is the original.
Question yeah i really don't i mean like.
I like it relevant no i think about the.
Kanye one because that one's pretty.
Interesting - well that's the thing he.
Probably i mean he describes himself as.
A genius yeah you know and whether he.
Might be maybe we're just all not smart.
Enough to understand what he's really.
Trying to say some people do understand.
Him you know you could say that about.
Where they say him kardashian.
All right or any of them any of the.
Kardashians like are they dumb are they.
Stupid or they're brilliant because were.
There yeah insanely well yeah and you.
Look at how they communicate with each.
Other and i think okay that's a dumb.
Person but they're not dumb yeah it's.
All part of the plan i don't know like.
This one i think a good example is like.
Paco he's actually likes to he's.
Actually a lot smarter than he looks.
He portrays portrays he likes to portray.
I think it's a defense mechanism that.
He's something that he's not as smart as.
He really is a lot of people do it yeah.
In the room yeah no but i mean like i.
Think i think it's it's it's so you.
Think maybe what i mean though what you.
In jenner in a general sense do you.
Think that is magnitude to kanye west.
And some sort like in what do you mean.
He now that made me not a defense.
Mechanism but he wants to portray yeah.
Maybe maybe he's like is super like a.
Genius but yeah it could be that tracing.
That many layers deep yeah but i i think.
I think i don't think he i think he.
Actually is like he is a really deep.
Thinker it's pretty clear than what what.
The things that he does say yeah but.
Sometimes she goes so deep into it that.
The fact that he doesn't know how to.
Convey that to the average person you.
Know he might be a genius but i still.
Consider that dumb at that point in the.
Same way is i would not put out a video.
That i person.
Think is really smart unless if i dumb.
It down because if it doesn't apply to.
People then what am i doing like i'm.
Just doing a dumb thing so he's going.
Too far into and he's not dumbing it.
Down i think that just dumber smart.
That's the easiest way to describe it.
Interesting and i think sometimes.
Whether he knows you know he knows how.
To dumb it down or he just thinks i'm.
I'm appealing to people who are thinking.
On my level i don't know why he would do.
It but clearly he knows how people react.
So he's doing it on purpose yeah you.
Know lissa t but you know that too.
That's so crazy or you could just be.
Dumb i mean anyone like that i feel they.
Have to be smart in certain ways right.
But it it just depends on how you would.
Define smartness i think we've already.
Said that yeah yeah i think being smart.
And being knowledgeable are different.
Though true and i think people confuse.
It to you so how did you describe smart.
I think the process of learning process.
Of learning okay.
Capability of learning to be able to.
Pick stuff up and then and continue to.
Yeah understand things at a deeper level.
Yeah okay like the depth.
I think the depth of which they can.
Understand things and learn things it.
Whereas knowledge is just memorization.
In my opinion hmm but it's it also the.
Ability to learn these things and convey.
It i actually think you know i think.
Because i actually think i understand a.
Lot of things at a deep level but i also.
Have a very hard time conveying what i'm.
Thinking a lot of times i think that's a.
Different skill set right right but.
Maybe you can be smarter one thing and.
Dumb and the other yeah yeah.
Comprehension kind of that's like what.
You struggle with right like you we're.
Talking about this with a phd we're just.
Like if you read something then they ask.
You what is it say you go well what is.
What like i just completely forgot it's.
Kind of similar yeah it's it's just that.
Well that's a little different i think.
Um i think i just i think in that way i.
Just learned.
Different ways from other people no yeah.
I mean everyone learns differently too.
Right i remember like some people are.
Visual learners and some people are word.
Learners and they need an index cards.
I'm definitely like visual or just do it.
And then learn yeah experience i can't.
When people explain something to me i'm.
Like it doesn't even matter whether.
They're just like words that just tell.
Me but uh yeah need to see it even when.
I'm like writing it's like so much.
Easier if i like put things in certain.
Places just visually so i can keep track.
Of what's what you should show you.
Should show your work i'd want to see.
How you like come up in the video.
Oh no it's like school and it's so like.
It would not make sense.
Cool it's entertaining notes and you.
Just be like oh this is gibberish pretty.
Much new just words no that's great i.
People should comment if they want to.
See that i want to one day uh take a.
Screenshot or something i've had some i.
Mean you you guys have seen some of like.
I make my little note cards for like.
When we do those conspiracy videos where.
Everything has to connect that i.
Literally have to draw out because it's.
Just too much going on in my head to.
Like figure out beginning middle end and.
All that stuff yeah i guess we're all.
Visual learners then are we i don't know.
How do we i mean i mean your left hand.
Is your right brained for sure but i do.
I'm ambidextrous i do everything with my.
Right that's physical yeah but you know.
Your right brained cuz you're very artsy.
And you're thinking that way maybe i.
Think most left-handed people are right.
Brained rights the right brain is like.
The creative side left brain is.
Analytical i think i'm more left brained.
I think i am - you're definitely a.
Little brain happened i think you're.
Sure especially for what you do like.
Analytical and barry just like so oh my.
God because i'm playing in a tournament.
This weekend for hearthstone and it's in.
Constructed mode i usually play rina.
Mode they're two different modes aha and.
Explain explained the.
Constructed is you have 30 cards that.
You can build like you build a deck and.
You choose all 30 cards so yeah it may.
Choose out of the 30 no you choose you.
Have access to all the cards you choose.
What you want in your deck like if they.
Gave you booster packs you open it with.
Your packs maybe if infinite booster.
Packs and you can make a deck so you can.
Make the ultimate arenas different you.
Get offered like three choices and you.
Pick of the three until you have a 30.
Card deck right which is a draft right.
Yeah yeah so i'm an expert in draft mode.
For hearthstone and so i'm trying to.
Learn constructed i've played for 4 days.
Now and so i have the best coach ever.
But he's been playing with me and we're.
Just like talking through plays and.
Sometimes i got so impressed there's.
Like such a big brain sometimes.
Sometimes sometimes so oh my god like.
Wow to see inside that mind yeah it's.
Not just like oh he's just know there's.
A there's a science to it.
I'm assuming there has to be method to.
His madness to learn anything that quick.
That big you're entering a tournament.
That's crazy yeah yeah it's a rank i.
Mean top 25 in it north america i can.
Make 9 to legend in like two days which.
Is a you go from rank 25 to rank 1 and.
Then i drink 1 if you win there you get.
To legend and in legend like the lower.
Rank legend you are it's like a ranking.
System it's certain position in the.
Service ranks are like levels and then.
Once you get to legend then it's like.
The higher the number that's always.
Higher than the number the better this.
Is in the new mode that you just rented.
Yeah yeah i mean i've hit legend in the.
Past but it's not what i stream it's not.
Like my expertise and then i was 14.
Hundredths legend and for some reason i.
Just kept winning.
I just kept winning and david woke up.
Was like i'm ranked 400 and then the.
Next day the next day i started.
Streaming from like.
Ring 400 and when he woke up was like.
I'm ranked 40 mean i will say everyone.
That i've ever met that is so has some.
Kind of serious interest in card games.
Into some ascent mm-hmm they're always.
They always have like a very intelligent.
Mind you know i think it just comes.
Naturally with it maybe it's pretty good.
At all games or most games not enough.
Yes as i've seen her general you have to.
Be for most games you have to recognize.
Pat it it'd be smart right patterns.
Because that's the only way you can.
Learn like if it was always random then.
It's not really a game mm-hmm right you.
Have to always find the plan you read.
The system it's actually you know yeah.
Yeah you have to be pretty smart to do.
That i mean i went so i wouldn't say i'm.
Like a professional high stone player.
Because i don't compete but i play at a.
Very high level for arena i'm like one.
Of the just the top rated people period.
And then but in and here a decade ago.
And i was also a competitive bloodline.
Champions player which is another game.
And i've definitely i'd love competing.
And i'm okay i'm okay at most rounders.
Of games yes almost everything almost.
Everything as i said some games you're.
Not good at fps so first-person shooters.
So like pubsey or something right for.
You first person yeah no its third.
Person and we've read it was third very.
Different i haven't played are you good.
At uh fighting games no i don't play.
Okay okay i've only played so many.
Genres so i started playing video games.
On his 14 and world of warcraft was my.
First video game and i went pro in it.
Talk about very fortunate addict and.
Then that's a good thing.
I mean for a while he committed 14 it's.
Pretty late to like start because girls.
Didn't grow up playing games and i had a.
Sister she didn't play games so why.
Would i play games right girls looked at.
Us when we play games and it wasn't cool.
Back then yeah it was like a secret.
Almost yeah i go home and like play.
Warcraft three years.
I wouldn't ever tell a girl yeah but now.
It's like yeah my stream more.
Embarrassing but you're saying that you.
Started at 14 which is actually that's.
Pretty late and you went pro on your.
First game i mean i went like when i.
Started playing world of warcraft i they.
Call it like keyboard turning like you.
Just instead of using your mouse to turn.
Use your keyboard to turn your.
Characters really slow in an efficient i.
I like don't think i realized i leveled.
Up until i hit like level eight and i.
Just kept chained dying to like i didn't.
Know anything it's it's just trying to.
Do something completely new in role of.
Our path was of quite complex game if.
You've never played anything before like.
Just moving around and like abilities.
The whole like ui and i get user.
Interface in that game is like confusing.
For someone brand new you know like i've.
Played pac-man right like i could level.
Up if - how do i quit bytom's like my.
Friend had to tell me press enter w.
Space you know yeah and i was really.
Thrown into this world and i remember um.
When arenas first came out which is like.
The competitive mode my friends told me.
I would play with them as like teams.
Before and then right before the.
Expansion came out and like the mode.
Came out they kicked me off the team.
Before i even got to play because.
They're like wow they told me i was like.
A 15 year old girl and they're like we.
Don't think they'll synergize well with.
Us and i looked up the terms energized.
Okay yeah i understand and then you went.
Wrong yeah and then i vowed to beat them.
Oh you're like a villain i was so.
Spiteful they got ranked 2 in the first.
Week in my team i played with random.
People i got was like ranked 300 and i.
Was so salty yeah like oh man.
And i was like i'm gonna beat them i'm.
Gonna freakin beep and i beat them on.
The way up there yeah so in a way you.
Gotta thank them for your i drove you i.
Would not have tried as hard yeah until.
They were like you can't play with us.
And i was like what do you mean i can't.
Play with you yeah this is exactly like.
You're in an anime you would be the.
Villain that's like getting revenge and.
Then you have to talk i guess you could.
Also be that character too if it's a.
Darker enemy i guess vengeance like a.
Kill bill kind of thing they excluded me.
They did because i believe you actually.
I my first teammate that i hit rank 1.
With i didn't use my microphone i didn't.
Use voice chat until we had taught top.
20 wow because my voice used to be even.
Higher than it is now so i would talk.
Like this and then no one would take me.
Seriously and only after he was like.
Whoa that's funny cuz i feel like when i.
Was playing games and there was girls.
With like really high voices all the.
Guys were just like do everything for.
Them yeah they would do people i thought.
I was you know awesome because everyone.
Wanted to play with me but right.
Different than competing they'll give.
You gold they'll give you free stuff and.
They'll want to spend time with you but.
They will not want to compete with you.
That makes yeah i could see i could see.
How that would work.
Yeah especially back then cool well i.
Mean i think this has been a we've been.
Flown for a while i didn't even notice.
Yeah but um i think we should wrap it up.
Yeah cool yeah thank you guys so much.
Thank you guys so much david and hoffa.
