Basically we sold smosh in 2011 and i.
Thought i had control of it for a couple.
Years and then come 2015 i was like oh.
Whoa whoa this is not mine anymore.
I feel like youtubers now honestly have.
It better in every regard except for the.
Over saturation in the market did you.
Feel competitive with brian when you're.
Talking to you yes just get the clampy.
Claps going welcome back to another.
Episode of off the pill podcast that was.
A nice timing this time today we have.
Very special guests mr. anthony padilha.
Saying that because i'd say that you.
Earlier today yeah no i said it actually.
On the is it too soon i said that on the.
One with ian oh just kidding sorry.
Talked about then we'll go through some.
Of that we also have damon in the.
Moderator seat and paco right next to me.
Music.
He's just used to it early at this point.
Yeah so yeah i mean i we are here with i.
Mean i'm sure most people know probably.
I i consider you and obviously ian d.
Like grandfathers of youtube because you.
Guys started in the very beginning i am.
Honored i am honored but i mean you were.
Like you were like was there people.
Before you nobody even knows i don't.
Know i don't know i can't really uh i've.
Never been able to take that in people.
Say that seemed like a shut up.
But if you think about it though when.
You guys started i don't even know i.
Wasn't on youtube in oh five yeah yeah.
Yeah we started uploading a november.
2005 there was there wasn't really.
Anyone that that uploaded consistently.
Alright time there were other people.
Obviously but not personalities per se.
You know not people that people would.
Come back to say over and over again.
Well for people who don't know just.
Probably a lot let's be honest yeah.
Everyone's a different time people who.
Don't know you and ian who we had a few.
A bunch of episodes ago are from smosh.
And smosh has over 25 million.
Subscribers.
You recently started well recently like.
Two years ago years ago start your own.
Channel which is at about three point.
Three million subscribers which is.
Pretty crazy in like two years right.
It's nice and healthy and i like it.
Yeah and yeah you've been just working.
On your own channel we just did.
Something together as well yeah yeah.
How's that been it's been really nice.
Now it's really nice there was a.
Transition period that was really.
Difficult going from a channel i don't.
Know how many million subscribers i had.
When i left 23 million or whatever to do.
My own thing and then people came over.
And wanted to see what i was doing there.
But truth be told i was still trying to.
Figure out what it was that he wanted to.
Do on my own you know and when i started.
Smosh with ian back in the day we were.
Able to figure it out without anyone.
Watching but now i was trying to figure.
Out what i wanted to do on my own and.
Millions of people were watching and it.
Was a lot of pressure but eventually.
Years later now i feel like i finally.
Figured out what it is that i want to do.
And i am really enjoying it yeah i mean.
Your your content is more geared like.
Towards an older audience um yeah where.
Is that i feel like smosh was a little.
Bit more for younger people right coming.
In yeah for sure you know i it was it.
Was just outright just straight-up.
Comedy for lack of a better term i'd say.
It was a little bit more shallow because.
There wasn't really a message that we.
Were always trying to spread or anything.
Like that was just comfort laughs and.
Leave with a smile on your face right.
And now the stuff that i'm doing i hope.
Has a little bit more of a deeper.
Message you know i hope people leave my.
Video is now feeling like they.
Understand people more mm-hmm.
With the yeah it was i spent a day with.
Blank you know so the one that i just.
Shot with you ryan was i spent a day.
With legendary youtubers and basically.
Gets a funny way to describe legendary i.
Mean dude like you are one of the most.
Legendary youtubers i don't know how.
Funny because it's like you were first.
Like you guys were the first we're not.
Talking about me they know but you're in.
It and you haven't.
Address that right you guys refer i.
Remember i started to not see actually.
David was before i was oh really.
Yeah and i remember watching your.
Pokemon video it was featured on the.
Home page of youtube that's when i first.
Crazy yeah copyrighted material yeah you.
Do homepage wow.
Well there is no money to be made so.
There was no one complaining well yeah.
That's true yeah yeah that is crazy.
Though i'm honored yeah you guys are i.
Mean people call me og right but then.
When i think of smosh i'm like actually.
No i mean no it is really difficult for.
Me to take a compliment so probably good.
To stop there yeah so what else do we.
Want to talk about that's really nice.
Eight point seven billion total views on.
Smosh channel that you helped create.
Yeah yeah created i i initially made.
Smosh as just a website and i was just.
For me and my group of friends in high.
School and you know so that that logo.
And everything was me as a 14 year old.
Kid you know in my bedroom just like.
Tinkering away with a little logo and.
Stuff and it's it is strange that you.
Know it became a brand and then you know.
I can leave that continue to do my own.
Thing and that brand still exists out.
There how not to get right into it but.
How i mean it wasn't a split instant.
Decision when you decided to leave smosh.
No.
How long were you unhappy there i know.
It's a long story.
Yeah yeah yeah i started having my i.
Started second-guessing everything in.
Early 2015 which was about a year year.
And a half before i eventually left.
Because i realized how much this brand.
That i thought i had ownership of was.
Really just you know the it was we.
Basically we sold smosh in 2011 and i.
Thought i had control of it for a couple.
Years and then come 2015 i was like oh.
Whoa whoa whoa this is not mine anymore.
Other people are controlling it they.
Wanted to be a certain way i want this.
To evolve i want this to kind of.
Keep up with me as i age and my values.
Change but because it wasn't mine.
Because it was owned by a company they.
Had very clear ideas for what that brand.
Should be and what it should remain as.
He gave me or give us an example of like.
Like something that they let you try to.
Do and they were like no no no that's.
Not like like i guess the cousin you're.
Doing now is that something you tried to.
Do earlier or no i didn't i didn't.
Necessarily you know i got to be honest.
I didn't necessarily try to do something.
That they outright said no don't do that.
But they were now you know 20 30 people.
Working without me necessarily giving a.
Direction to them and they were all.
Doing this thing and plans were being.
Made constantly i couldn't tell everyone.
To stop and you know whole production on.
A million different things that were.
Going on behind the scenes so i could.
Come in and change things it wasn't it.
Didn't operate the same way as just two.
Guys obviously you know i there were so.
Many more moving elements to it that it.
Became apparent that it wasn't mine.
Mm-hmm you know so when you say in 2011.
Right you said we sold so when you say.
That you sold what did that mean cuz you.
Guys were still like i never understood.
That yes because you guys were still on.
It could yeah all the time yeah what.
Changed basically from 2010 or right.
Before you sold it mm-hmm what changed.
Um a company approached us and said hey.
We can offer you x amount of money in.
Stocks and we will now own the company.
100% you will be employees of this.
Company you will be salaried we will pay.
You well and you know me growing up from.
A pretty poor family in suburban.
Sacramento i was like yeah you know that.
Sounds great i don't know what the.
Future of this is gonna look like and i.
Get to have a guaranteed paycheck which.
Is very strong like especially at the.
Time oh yeah it wasn't like we weren't.
Sure at in 2010 yeah that this was gonna.
Continue yeah i was 23 and i was like i.
Need to make sure that i am set up in.
Any way that i can.
And i just had a fear that i was gonna.
Be stuck in poverty forever so i was.
Like this is my way out you know give me.
That give me that paycheck and you know.
That monthly paycheck and that that.
Stock that you value the company to be.
Worth i will take that and hold on to.
That and hopefully sell it for a lot in.
The future and then you know i could.
Retire or sell my own company on the.
Side or whatever and spoiler alert when.
The company shut down last year that.
Stock just evaporated into nothing ever.
Ended up - yeah you guys got screwed.
Uh yeah yeah yeah we got screwed but i i.
Also i also feel slightly responsible.
For that you know so i feel like i if i.
Were smarter i would have asked more.
Questions i would have had more people.
Looking into it for me i would have done.
More research instead of being so.
Excited to sign that dotted line right.
Did you have a lawyer look over your.
Contract well as a lawyer but i don't.
Know if the lawyer really had my best.
Interest you know yeah and and there.
Were other people that had their hands.
In it that i know didn't have my best.
Interest in it so maybe it's safe to say.
That you know a 23 year old from a small.
Town was taken advantage of or two of us.
I guess yeah we're you and ian on the.
Same page during all this we were yeah.
We were but i feel like we really didn't.
Do enough research we didn't really look.
Into it enough and there was something.
About the the pace at which we were.
Creating content and just moving.
Constantly that it felt like we couldn't.
Really take time to to really take it.
All in yeah we weren't able to really.
Soak it in and understand what we're.
Really doing or that you know i can only.
Speak for myself right yeah well i mean.
I i mean that makes sense because i i.
Think it was around that same time maybe.
2000 a little earlier like 2009 for me.
Where i almost gave up my channel to do.
A nickelodeon show whoa.
It's it's a show that actually was.
Created yeah it was called supah ninjas.
Uh-huh and it was kind of based off of i.
Don't we did a lot of ninja stuff yeah.
Yeah that should i.
It went out for like two seasons i think.
But anyway it was a nickelodeon show and.
Shawn and i were gonna do it but then.
They said you got to get rid of your.
Channel or everything on it's not.
Nickelodeon appropriate yeah yeah i get.
I was pretty clean though but i mean.
They were clean that's really again i.
Get because nickelodeon super super.
Clean yeah but it was a time where like.
I had literally i was considering it.
Like i was probably making more on.
Youtube then i was gonna make on.
Nickelodeon but there was something.
About it being a real thing right yeah.
Nobody knew youtube is gonna be a thing.
So i i completely understand like if you.
Someone told me hey here's a salary i.
Mean and it was a great amount oh yeah.
Oh yeah yeah then for sure.
Yeah so i mean i don't think that's uh i.
Don't think they can be helped like i.
Said you guys were like a pioneer right.
So nobody there was no rules back then.
No there's like the business it was the.
Wild west and you yeah you didn't have.
Any figure it out and that's what it was.
Mm-hmm so yeah people definitely saw the.
Goldmine oh yeah other people did yeah.
Probably specifically artists right yeah.
Yeah i remember back in the day there.
Was talk amongst the youtube community.
About you guys working with the disney.
Executive maybe he was a manager yeah.
Yeah he started off as our manager and.
He became the president of the company i.
Don't wanna get too much details until.
Now or went when the company dissolved.
He was he was still there i think he.
Left about six months before i did for.
His own personal reasons yeah got it.
Well uh just going back to kind of what.
You said so there there seems to be like.
A lot of different pros and cons to.
Being like a legendary og youtubers you.
Know like one of the big cons of being.
Taken advantage of clearly yeah back.
Then when no one knew was going yeah so.
I guess we want that if there's more.
Pros and cons that you wanted to explore.
On or maybe in comparison of like the.
Youtubers now then they haven't that i.
Guess a lot of people can thank you for.
In a way because you had to deal with.
Those hardships oh i see you're saying i.
I feel like uh youtubers now honestly.
Have it better in every regard.
Except for the oversaturation in the.
Market there's so much more competition.
And really that's that's the only.
Downside that i see maybe there's more.
That i don't see because i'm kind of.
Disconnected from that now but i feel.
Like back in the early days it was.
Figuring things out on your own it was.
The lack of money in the market there.
Were obviously less viewers on the.
Market to to to have content even be.
Viewed by and brands didn't take it.
Seriously companies in take it take you.
Seriously and i feel like all of that.
Has changed yep and the only thing.
That's that's become difficult is that.
Now there's just so many people that are.
That are part of it yeah well i mean a.
Big difference to is like you know back.
In the day there was i mean we say.
There's a lot less people but there was.
Still a lot of people oh yeah i mean.
Yeah but i feel like back in the day.
It's like if somebody made something.
Awesome yeah eventually people would.
Find that person right i feel like now.
You gotta be with some you got to get.
Some kind of hookup like you gotta be.
Collabing unless you're like magnificent.
Mmm i hate like you have to like be with.
An mcn or you gotta like be friends with.
Somebody there's always like you gotta.
Have like connections in collab and do.
All these things were like back in the.
Days just just make good stuff and then.
Eventually it'll pay off yeah used to be.
My advice to people they'd be like how.
Do i get my content like how do i create.
A fanbase and i'd always be like just.
Make good stuff focus on making good.
Stuff don't try to get fans they'll come.
To you and eventually people will find.
Your stuff when you make good enough.
Stuff you can't say that now nope that.
Doesn't mean sadly yeah like it used to.
Be like just just do your follow your.
Dreams and no no no through the math yes.
Follow the algorithm there's there's.
Like twenty one day's worth of content.
Uploaded every minute on youtube or.
Something ridiculous right yeah that's.
Crazy yeah it's just insane and i don't.
Know if youtube like wants to admit it.
Or not but i feel like youtube has.
Become just a gaming and music platform.
The things that are there are on.
Trending at the time is just like music.
Yeah i i don't know if it was always.
Like that or not but i feel like it's.
It's gone that direction.
The trending tab to check it don't want.
Us no not really i think it was out.
Because i'm curious yeah so but it.
Doesn't i don't i don't understand it.
Maybe there'll be a video with like.
10,000 views on it no one understands.
How trending works i think it's some.
Combination of the speed at which.
Viewers are coming in and the.
Interaction they're having with the.
Content and also where they're coming.
From mm-hmm i don't understand the exact.
Algorithm though yeah i have no idea.
Either.
I think the algorithm is always changing.
The advertisers and yeah different times.
It's always change you said we're always.
Chasing the algorithm yeah and you never.
You never know what is gonna work really.
You know the the best way to do things.
Now is just like try to get an audience.
To stay with your video as long as you.
Can mm-hmm that's the only thing so it.
Goes back to what you guys were saying.
Make good content make good conscious.
Keep going yeah but it's different now.
It's not just it's not just make good.
Content but it's make captivating.
Content that people feel like they can't.
Click away from yes they're constantly.
You know on that page there's always at.
Least one other video that can be seen.
On the screen at once unless it's in a.
Full screen yeah and that video is.
Always enticing them and you're battling.
To keep people watching instead of.
Clicking that other person's derail but.
That's thing to like you need to have a.
Really good title and thumbnail yes so.
That they they click away from someone.
Else's we're here to go to yours and.
Also you know the title and thumbnail is.
All that really matter if you think.
About it in this context and your video.
Content is just there to prove that it.
Was worth that click it's it's almost.
Backwards now exactly up well that's the.
Secrets of youtube well i want to.
Explore this a little bit more because.
Uh you decided to step away make your.
Own content you know you had millions of.
People's eyes on you yeah we're i'm sure.
You felt the pressure of like you know.
Your former boss is looking over your.
Shoulder now yep a lot of eyes looking.
Over your shoulder but you do have this.
Open creativity how much did you play.
Around the algorithm and stuff or were.
You more strictly like no i want to do.
What i want to do no you know how do you.
How do you play the game like what's.
Your mindset now yeah.
Tackling you ah initially i didn't even.
Know what.
Once it from me i just made content when.
I first left and i experiments it with a.
Million different types of videos and.
The things that's the thing that stuck.
Work was content that was a little bit.
Longer and appealed to a general.
Audience that didn't necessarily know.
Have to know who i was to view it so.
Then i started making more of that and.
That eventually evolved into that i.
Spent a day with series which is what i.
Just shot with you today ryan yeah yeah.
And i think that really works because.
It's it's captivating in the sense that.
It's a subject that's easily digestible.
People are like oh i want to learn more.
About whatever it is legendary youtubers.
Or you know pro cosplayers or.
Flat-earthers or a sm artists and they.
Stick around because the way that i edit.
Is i think it's captivating or mike my.
Editor is extremely good and then the.
Contents long enough that the youtube.
Algorithm rewards you for that watch.
Time right right yeah it's kind of a.
Formula it's a way yeah for sure and you.
Got it you have to unfortunately i tried.
To fight it for the longest time really.
Short content like no i'm sticking to.
What i grew up with like it but you have.
To you have to certain degree you want.
To be able to keep ya audience keyboard.
Keep doing it as a career right hi yeah.
You have to you have to find that.
Balance and i was always so against it.
But i like i finally got to a point.
Where like okay i'm willing to give.
Because there's no point if if no one's.
Seen it right yeah yeah and it's a hard.
Position to be in because you're like i.
Wanna make the content that i like.
That's why i started that's why i want.
To keep going that's what gets me up in.
The morning but at the same time you.
Want to be able to keep doing that yeah.
And you're not gonna be able to keep.
Making content at all if people aren't.
Watching exactly so you have to find a.
Happy marriage between this is what my.
Audience wants this where the general.
Public wants when they find my videos.
And also this is what i like to do and.
It's a game they get to play figure out.
What it is that you like versus you know.
What's gonna get people tips from a.
Legendary youtuber go check out enjoy go.
Check but check out is serious i dare.
You do was it c on that and i don't know.
If this is why i mean we already cuz we.
Already talked to ian so we know that.
You guys are cool and.
Stuff but how weird would it be to have.
En on the show to have him on my show.
Because it would be you to you and yeah.
Yeah i mean i've distance myself from.
Doing anything smosh related and i'm.
Happy with that for the time being.
Because i really want to establish.
Myself as an independent creator as.
Someone that's doing their own thing and.
People will always say anthony from.
Smosh which doesn't bother me but the.
Same time i i feel like i could be known.
For what i'm doing now just as much and.
I feel like i need to do that before i.
Mm-hmm start pressure revisiting my past.
And and you know inviting people used to.
Being small or short or whatever you.
Know i feel like i need to establish but.
That's what i mean that i feel like it's.
So you're saying legendary youtubers i.
Can think of more like fitting than you.
Guys that's why i brought that up on.
Your show like what you should be really.
Asking yourself a lot of stuff but it's.
Just a weird scenario because i guess it.
Makes sense it makes sense because you.
Can really interview yourself well yeah.
Also i know i know what the hell's going.
On in my life oh i know what you see.
Your answers to other questions too well.
You could ask him right now no on off.
The bill pot yeah that's the stuff out.
When we were talking about all i want to.
Ask you the same i got a question here.
So you know you're a lot of youtubers.
They want to make the transition into.
Hollywood and it seems like you you know.
You're one of the very few youtubers.
Have stayed true to the platform and.
Creating mmm you know being a youtuber.
Mm-hmm and in every sense of that word.
Mm do you have do you still have desired.
I mean i don't know if you ever did but.
Do you have desire to cross over yeah.
Yeah i i i do really enjoy acting and i.
Have really been enjoying learning how.
To get in touch with my emotions and.
Express those emotions not just you know.
Through my therapy which you know helped.
Me get over all that stuff that we.
Talked about with with companies and my.
Old company and all that but it also.
Helped me realize that i've been.
Avoiding being in touch with my feelings.
For so long.
And acting kind of goes hand-in-hand.
With therapy i feel it'll i've been able.
To tap into why i'm feeling the things.
That i'm feeling and acting is a lot.
About that it's about feeling things and.
Not not saying or trying to show things.
Which is actually feeling them and i.
Feel like that's something that a lot of.
People don't really get a lot of on.
Youtube so i've been taking some of that.
Like i've something like i'm just gonna.
Talk about my feelings on here and see.
How people feel about that and then i.
Feel like they also people want to.
Listen more when you talk about your.
Feelings and you're vulnerable so i want.
To get good at acting too so that maybe.
People will listen to what i have to say.
Because you know they could they see me.
Exploring my emotions on screen mm-hmm.
Do you feel like those videos where you.
Do explore your most emotion do a lot.
Better yeah for sure for sure and people.
Have i think they feel a little bit more.
Of a connection because they feel like.
You know i'm being real yeah and i feel.
Like on youtube it's kind of hard to.
Find people that are being real mm-hmm.
Are you referring to some people when.
You say that i'm not referring to anyone.
General i'm just saying for my general.
Person but i have a follow-up question i.
Guess because you know you said this.
Platform is being oversaturated yeah.
Where a lot of in the beginning was kind.
Of like you know it is a lot more raw.
This is we are this is our how we feel.
Hmm and then it became like mass.
Production where you took the feeling.
Out yeah because it's so much so like we.
Need to keep pushing these out just.
Content content that in a way audiences.
Now are looking for something more than.
To continue in that swai you do have.
That connection a lot more yeah exactly.
I feel like i'm just i'm tired of.
Shallow content and i don't enjoy.
Watching it i don't enjoy making it and.
I'm honestly like i i feel like people.
Must be feeling the same way i'm feeling.
Because i'm just tired of it was what's.
Shell what is shallow content for me.
It's it's coming it's it's it's almost.
Like a it's watching something and.
Feeling like it was really just.
Entertainment.
You know it's um it's like a challenge.
Video or i don't know i can't think of.
Something specific because i honestly.
Don't watch that stuff it's something.
That i feel like doesn't really make me.
Leave feeling like i learned something.
Or you know maybe i learn something.
About a subject or learn something about.
The human psyche in some way so how does.
That sound pretentious that's your.
Interest what are some things on youtube.
That you like watching anything that has.
Education attached to it in some way.
What's the german channel that starts.
With the k that's all animated and so.
Educational cursed well i don't know.
Something like that starts with the k i.
Can never say what say we say i hope i.
Hope i offended someone when i say.
Definitely yeah i'm getting cancelled.
Right now just with a case that would be.
The russian version um i'm if just.
Offending everyone yeah you're gonna get.
So cancer i'm getting hansel germans and.
The russians yeah um but basically.
Education is what you're saying you want.
To learn now that's that's where i.
That's what i feel like i didn't waste.
My time coming out of you know or you.
Know something like this like a podcast.
Where people are talking about how they.
Feel in their experiences right i also.
Enjoy that but coming in for content.
Laughing and leaving unless that content.
That makes me laugh kind of says.
Something about you know human behavior.
In general or something i i will enjoy.
It but i don't find myself compelled to.
Keep coming back over and over and over.
Well i mean like that's one of the.
Reasons why i like doing the podcast as.
Well as cuz yeah.
For me it's taken by my own selfish.
Thing it's like helen i like to like.
These conversations i could never.
Normally have you know what videos right.
And then also like talking to people.
That you relate to other youtubers yeah.
And you know up until recently a lot of.
The you know talking about like burning.
Out and like and feeling like the.
Pressures and all that stuff was very.
Kept to yourself up until like the past.
Few years that's true i didn't know.
You're feeling any of this yeah i mean.
No most people don't and yeah and for.
The most part like you don't really put.
That into your content like if when you.
Were with smosh like you didn't.
That kind of stuff it was just like.
Skits yeah this is how come you laugh.
But like i mean for you yourself i mean.
At what point were you when you were.
With smosh feeling that kind of i mean.
If you were feeling that kind of burnout.
Mm-hmm and it was it more a burnout.
Because of workload or was it because.
You just didn't want to be creating that.
Kind of content anymore it was more than.
I just didn't feel like creating that.
Kind of content i am a workaholic so i.
Love working all the time so it didn't.
Really bother me you know the workload.
Didn't bother ya it was more just you.
Don't you wanted to get out of it yeah.
And i still i still enjoyed it you know.
So it wasn't really black-and-white.
Because i did still enjoy it but i felt.
Like i enjoyed or as more being pulled.
Toward other kinds of content mhm but.
Even like you said you always enjoyed.
Acting did you enjoy acting in that.
Style i did not you got over it right we.
Got super over it after a couple years i.
Would imagine so yeah you know just.
Acting    it was like that's basically.
How i would define my acting and smart.
Yeah just like high-pitched like kids.
Like that right it's like it you know we.
Got over it yeah you know i started when.
I was 17 18 and i was making content.
That i thought was you know funny and at.
The same time people a couple years.
Younger than me which ended up being 12.
13 14 year olds thought it was funny and.
That kind of fit in with with what their.
Interests were but as i grew you know i.
Left some when i was 29 i feel like i.
Couldn't keep making content for the.
Same people that i was making it for.
When i first started right right so and.
Then so when you first cuz you said you.
Are doing what you want to do now yeah.
When you first had left and did your own.
Channel hmm how long like what what kind.
Of i didn't watch enough to know yeah i.
Saw the first couple videos it you know.
It was being talked about but like how.
How was that process because it must.
Have been i know you had some struggles.
I saw some interviews and stuff but like.
What were you thinking of feeling during.
That time it was pretty supportive right.
Oh really supportive you know i was.
Really happy with all the support that i.
Had other other youtubers fans from from.
Back over at smosh.
The whole community seemed really.
Supportive of everything but it was it.
Was a struggle because i wanted to make.
Stuff and i didn't know what to make and.
I also felt like this opportunity had.
Been given to me to create content on.
Youtube and speak to a large amount of.
People and i knew that i made a lot of.
People happy when i was making content.
As smosh and i wanted to do that for.
Myself but i didn't know what to do and.
I was also giving myself pressure to.
Immediately get bigger numbers and.
Appeal to just as many people as i did.
On smosh so i had immense amount of.
Pressure constantly over my shoulders.
And i feel like it wasn't really until i.
Got over that that i was able to focus.
On what it what is it that i like to do.
Like what kind of message do i want to.
Spread by these videos right you know i.
Realized that i am tired of watching.
Like i said shallower stuff but also.
Negative negativity on youtube is such a.
Huge thing that's popular right now yeah.
From a lot of commentary channels and.
Reaction channels and things like that.
And i'm not saying react channel that.
That is a positive space but there are.
Channels where people react to things in.
A negative way and like roasting is so.
Popular and stuff like that and i just.
I'm kind of tired of it i'm like we have.
A choice about what kind of a message we.
Want to spread and how we want people to.
Feel after watching our videos so why.
Not take that and make it something.
Positive that makes you feel good and.
Not in the cheesy wholesome way where.
You know i'm like ooh this this feels.
Gross this feels like i'm in a cult like.
This is not you're not being honest when.
You're trying to be wholesome here yeah.
So i try to make my content i try to.
Have be like wholesome and make you feel.
Like just make you feel happy at the end.
Of it but at the same time come at you.
With jokes and be really fast-paced and.
A little bit edgy at the same time god.
I've never explained any of that stuff.
Before so i didn't know how to put that.
Into words so yeah that's that's good.
Though cuz there's clearly shows that.
You thought about it a lot.
So and yeah like you said you went to.
Therapy.
Yeah i'm still going trust me that's.
Good it's good and i would recommend it.
To everyone that can because it's it's.
Made me realize things about my past may.
Be more sympathetic toward my past self.
And therefore made me more sympathetic.
Toward my current self because i.
Understand why i am the way i am more.
Right okay well with that being said.
We're gonna take a quick little shishi.
Break it get some therapy.
Ooh and so we will be right back and.
We're back yeah so what were you talking.
About just now how there is there is a.
Connection between you and paco oh you.
Guys first met there the shishi break we.
Just found out yeah you guys were.
Actually you guys have met before.
Yeah very pleasant terms we did a i did.
A show called internet icon and it was.
Like a american idol but for youtubers i.
Think it's more survivor kind of server.
You're getting hold it all oh yeah every.
Day let's call america no no but you.
Have to like okay i never watched.
Survivor okay so anyway yes i did that.
Show and i had anthony on is one of the.

Top four it was smosh jenna marbles and.
Pewdiepie.

Same episode yeah that was a big episode.
Yeah yeah and all of them relate you all.
In the same day    that paco guy i.
Don't know.

I kicked you off the nellis that was his.
Rightful place.
Got to that high in that case you.
Deserve that anyway that shows how far.
Back we go we're old school friends wow.
That's old school to think beautify and.
Jennamarbles our old school because i.
Can still imagine them yeah i remember.
When they were new yeah i was like i.
Remember when jenna came along i was.
Like all this girls oh yeah i remember.
She wasn't even that big i just like.
This girls funny she has some guys she's.
Gonna blow a beauty pie i honestly.
Didn't believe like i knew he was big i.
Just didn't believe that his content was.
Gonna be well he changed it right but.
Yeah i didn't believe that was gonna.
Last it transcended it completely and we.
Need a justice child that smells like.
Okay this guy's brilliant yeah yeah he's.
Doing he knows how to craft things he.
Knows how to give people what they want.
Yep he's smart he's smart and he's.
Number one right now right to still or.
Is it a series but we don't talk about.
That yeah speaking of number one this is.
The question that i'm i'm kind of.
Curious about there's not even twitter.
Question she's not a twitter question.
Since david show my question yeah it.
Straight from the heart okay so i know.
That both of you guys were the top most.
Subscribed in the world both number one.
At certain points in history yeah you.
Guys made history wow i think i think at.
A certain point either when ryan was.
Number one smosh was number two and when.
The smosh was number one ryan was number.
Two i mean i'm asking is anthony yeah.
Did at any point did you feel.
Competitive when you didn't really know.
Ryan did you feel competitive with brian.
Yeah when you're talking to ian yes yes.
So you guys talked a lot of it no no it.
Wasn't that it wasn't like it wasn't.
Like oh this sucks or anything like that.
About the content or ryan personally but.
It was just it was a cool space to be in.
It was like we were racing for.
Subscribers at the time and it was a it.
Felt like the whole world was watching.
Even though we weren't making videos.
About it we weren't you know you weren't.
Trying to milk it or anything like that.
But it felt like people were watching.
And me maybe we were just in our heads.
About it but you know comment sirs we're.
Constantly you know when you could.
Comment on people's channels people.
Commenting on the channels and you would.
Just see it there all the time so it.
Would get in your head when you're up.
There and that that race is going on and.
People are posting the the difference in.
Subs and stuff and it was it was.
Exciting and even back in the day on.
Your profile page it would say number.
One most subscribe i i'd like that great.
Good for the day right it was like a.
Number one most viewed for the day yeah.
Yeah i like that stuff i'm sure it i.
Mean subscriptions like we we talked.
About before it doesn't matter as much.
Yeah but yeah but at the time it did.
Yeah it was a big deal because it.
Actually you know meant something like.
People act your subscribers would get.
Your videos yeah always.
And there were top subscriber lists.
Exact they were top most viewed the day.
Of the month of that whatever and those.
Would be lists that people would.
Frequent and that's how you would get.
New viewers is by making something that.
Landed somewhere on those way exactly.
Yeah and now they're gone no but all.
Right it's funny cuz there was so a bit.
Of like competition.
But like i think like the first time i.
Met you was youtube live yeah and even.
Deep i just am i gonna met everyone even.
Kev all you guys so 2007 i think or nine.
I was in college dirty and that's bo.
Burnham is kind of shy awkward but like.
Super talented so yeah he's awesome.
Yeah but then like we met everyone and.
Everyone was like super nice it was such.
A different feeling cuz i just went to.
Vidcon yeah the first time in like eight.
Years yeah and this is even before the.
First vidcon i know it's such a.
Different feeling like when we that.
First youtube live when everyone met up.
I was just like.
This is like a sense of like like family.
It was family everybody yeah everybody.
Was so nice and like welcoming inside.
Yeah oh i think i review yeah definitely.
Seen you before yeah like it was such a.
Nice feeling now i mean not to say that.
People aren't nice but it doesn't have.
There's so many people and new people.
That yeah it feels a little it does it.
Feels different it's not it's not that.
We're expecting it feels very.
Disconnected people know how to network.
Now and it'll exactly we're almost.
Trained to networking yeah so they meet.
You and they talk in a very specific way.
And you know it's you know it's a.
Rehearsed thing that they say to.
Everyone yeah and the tone of their.
Voice was like oh hey oh my god yeah so.
Nice and but it's like not daniel.
Genuine it's like you're actually.
Connecting in any real way right but i.
Don't think people realize that it's.
Weird cuz it's so common i would assume.
It's common now because i haven't been.
To one of those convinced that was my.
First time to anything in like a long.
Time yeah i was like wow this is so.
Weird.
Different wasn't overwhelming it was it.
Was and it made me feel really old.
Because i grew up watching you and.
They're like huge now got three million.
Yeah you're like 25 people saying i wash.
You in elementary school and they're.
Like like eighteen year like adults yeah.
Yeah yeah it's it's crazy yeah i.
Actually interviewed a joanne acedia and.
She is 19 and i realized that she was.
Four years old when i started uploading.
A new content to youtube while yes so.
Another question i don't know if it's.
Too personal but i'm curious right well.
I think a lot of people are curious.
About hmm how do you as a large youtuber.
Mm-hmm.
When you're dating mm-hmm just talk.
About that.
You're like oh hey dating is um it's a.
Confusing landscape to be in just.
Because you never know what people's.
Intentions are i have a personal fear of.
Being cancelled and for some reason in.
My head i think that someone is gonna.
Set me up in some way so i'm like okay.
So someone yeah i'm like i'm like.
There's gonna be some crazy reporter.
That's gonna go undercover and date me.
And then they're gonna like try to get.
Me to say something i don't know why i.
Like i have these weird irrational yes.
So it's it's complicated i actually kind.
Of remember that about you there was a.
Couple irrational fears no yeah he.
Mentioned something else in the past too.
That you what i don't remember what is.
Some kind of eggs aiya tea anxiety thing.
I have intense anxiety right and i had.
Panic attacks for very long so maybe.
That's the thing i'm trying to remember.
Maybe what triggered that um what.
Triggered panic attacks or what what.
Triggers it for you now it's just.
Feeling completely overwhelmed it.
Happens a lot less frequently now the.
Last time i had a last time i had a.
Panic attack was i was about to karaoke.
With a bunch of people that i i didn't.
Really want to hang with but i had.
Agreed to do it and i was like i'm gonna.
Have to sing in front of these people i.
Don't even want to hang out with them.
And that was enough that was enough to.
Do it for me oh really.
But for the most part it's it's a fear.
Of fear that's what a panic attack.
Really is so it's because you start.
Getting anxiety and then anxieties.
Anxiety everyone feels anxiety but then.
It really starts spiraling out of.
Control when you start getting when it.
Starts building on itself you start to.
Feel fear and you say oh i'm about to.
Get a panic attack and you're like oh.
Just business this is this thing this is.
Gonna be such a terrible situation this.
Is not the right place to get one and.
Then you start going bigger and bigger.
And bigger with the way that you feel.
Like your whole world is crushing down.
It's gonna be the worst thing ever and.
Then it becomes that because you have.
That fear mm-hmm and did a going to.
Therapy.
Is that when all of it kind of changed.
Where didn't happen way less i don't.
Know if that i don't know if that did.
Maybe but a big thing that helped me.
Back in the day get get over because i.
Was having panic attacks multiple times.
A day for a while and i think what.
Really helped me get over that was i.
Read some article online about it and.
They said no they explained about how.
It's just the fear of having a panic.
Attack that gives you a panic attack.
Which is a really weird thing to read.
I'm like what.
That doesn't make sense and then they.
Mentioned that it's the fear of being.
Out of control so they mentioned also.
That it be very difficult to give.
Yourself a panic attack because you'd.
Feel like you're in control of giving.
Yourself a panic attack so i sat down.
And tried to give myself one and i.
Wasn't able to get one and i realized it.
Was because it was the fear that was.
Causing it and then i felt more in.
Control of it and that helps me that.
That didn't get over that's a good.
Advice for people who have panic attacks.
Try and give it to yourself it's also.
Scary though because some people might.
Not be ready for that you have to really.
Be ready for that because okay we don't.
Want to give advice anyway this is.
Anthony's experience i do remember you.
Mention it well i don't know if it was.
That specifically but i remember.
Something like that my mom or phobic and.
For the dumb people like me was that.
Mean that means that she has she has a.
Very she gets panic attacks all the time.
And an intense fear of not being in.
Control as well and that's kind of made.
Her reside only within the boundaries of.
The house because that's where she feels.
Most comfortable so do you feel like.
Learning more about yourself and how to.
Deal with the the panic attacks that.
You've learned to kind of like let go in.
A way are you holding on more tight and.
A little bit doing that now and it's.
Helped me let go a little bit more and.
I've become more comfortable knowing.
That something that makes me.
Uncomfortable may happen because i'm i'm.
Just i don't know i don't know why i'm.
Just like if it happens it happens and.
That's really helped me do you do you.
Feel that what you were feeling with the.
Anxiety and panic attacks had to do in.
Part with you becoming very famous at an.
Early age.
Oh maybe but i think most of it was that.
I i feel like it might have happened.
Regardless if it wasn't if it wasn't you.
Know cuz maybe it was from the fear and.
Anxiety that i felt around maintaining.
This status of you know whatever i was.
Like number one most subscribed at the.
Time when i was getting i don't know.
It's like 2009 or something when it.
Really started happening pretty.
Intensely for me and i was up there on.
The top maybe that's why you know i had.
A lot of anxiety about that but i feel.
Like if it wasn't that then it would.
Have been anxiety about my finances or.
Something because i grew up without much.
Money and i felt like i would have been.
Stuck in that and i would have probably.
Been really stressed about that as well.
I think it's great that you're talking.
About this right now because there are.
So many more than ever young kids who.
Are getting super famous like on tik-tok.
Like i'm at vidcon you see these little.
Kid these 12 year old left 10 year old.
Kids who have millions of fans and they.
Don't know how to deal with theirs know.
I always say this there's no book or.
Therapy book on how to become famous.
Yeah there's there's no right well.
There's probably a right way to do it.
But there's there's no one that will.
Teach you how to do it you just have to.
Navigate that i feel like i feel like i.
Was fortunate enough to blow up in a.
Time where the general public didn't pay.
Attention so i was able to still go.
Right to the store i was able to still.
Do whatever you know i don't feel like.
People like jeffrey star or james.
Charles can go to any store without.
Having mobs of people be excited to see.
Them and i feel like yeah i was number.
One most subscribed at a time where you.
Were able to be a little bit more.
Incognito and i was i'm glad that i was.
Able to kind of warm up to it and write.
Figure things out but if i were to go.
From zero to a hundred now if i were to.
Become number one most subscribed now.
Going from yesterday not having you know.
Any following it would be completely.
Overwhelming and i would probably feel.
Burnout and fear and like all these.
Things that would probably made me pull.
Away from it iii think majore like i.
Wouldn't recommend i don't know at what.
Age but like people who are i'm gonna.
Say at least fifty.
Like you have to these people who are.
Under the age of like i don't even know.
What the exact number is but kids kids.
Becoming famous i don't think it's good.
For them and any kid i mean look at look.
At every single like disney star back in.
The day yeah macaulay culkin macaulay.
Well they all go through some kind of.
Phase some of them making out okay a lot.
Of them end up really messed up miley.
Cyrus miley cyrus i mean a lot of people.
And and she kind of turned it around a.
Little bit.
Right but everybody goes through that.
Phase and and it's it's bound to happen.
Yeah and a lot of it stems from like.
They're on top of the world at one point.
And you grew up with that becoming your.
Normal right.
Can you imagine thinking that your whole.
Normal is this fame that you have as a.
Ten-year-old and then or whatever even.
Younger and then you know reality hits.
You when your knee goes well and that.
That fame is gone or you don't have.
People mentoring you in the same way and.
Would you treat you differently people.
Treat you differently yeah and i'm sure.
Part of feeling like a has-been probably.
Really does that to you and that only.
Applies to certain people i'm not saying.
The people you mentioned and then also.
Just having it's almost like a lot of.
Power to do whatever you want and then.
Not knowing what to do with that mm-hmm.
It's it's uh like i think the only way.
You can really survive the hat is having.
Like really really tight circles and.
Having it making sure those people in.
That circle know how to educate you on.
That a support system yeah it's i mean.
Cuz it happens it happens to i mean even.
For me like having like different stages.
Of like thinking i'm more important than.
I am and then going to the stage of like.
Wait up wait no this doesn't mean.
Anything like and it's and then seen.
Them like becoming number one and then.
Becoming number two in like going to.
That psychology as a kid is different.
Like maybe now cuz we've been in in it.
For so long it doesn't really mean much.
But as a kid and now we're older kids at.
The time right yeah yeah only happier.
Like really but imagine like a.
Twelve-year-old if when you were 12 and.
That happens soon you're like the.
Biggest thing in the world you see.
Yourself a certain way you don't realize.
Like when that gets taken away from you.
And it will it's you got to go through.
That psyche like something's.
Gonna happen there like it's not a good.
Combo unless you have like the best head.
On your shoulders right right which can.
Only be provided by a support system of.
Probably older right which is really.
Like when you're at the top of the world.
Whoo yeah you gotta imagine the people.
Around you people circulating towards.
You oh yeah you know positive.
Reinforcement yeah things you don't.
Necessarily deserve.
Who was your in like your circle like.
Who are your mentors and people that.
Kind of kept you in check is you you.
Seem all right right now like i don't.
See i don't know i found it person i.
Don't think i really had any back then.
But it was different you know i wasn't a.
Macaulay culkin you know it was whose.
Youtube and it was weren't so much under.
A microscope as it is now yeah i also i.
Wasn't going out i wasn't super social i.
Wasn't going out to parties where people.
Worshipped me or something like that you.
Know and i was i was also i feel like i.
Stayed pretty humble i think part of it.
Was that i felt like i was not deserving.
Of anything that i had so i feel like.
That helped me not get into into my head.
And i still feel like that you sometimes.
You know i learned that it's imposter.
Syndrome which is a real thing where you.
Feel like you don't deserve whatever it.
Is that you have and assume people are.
Gonna find out that you're a fraud and.
You've been faking it this whole time.
That's the only reason people like you.
But i've always had that and i think.
That as bad as that feels to have to.
Think of yourself that way it it's it.
Helped me where do you think what do you.
Think that feeling came from of you.
Feeling like you're not really worthy of.
All of these great successes i don't.
Know i feel like bringing maybe i don't.
Know let me know part of it maybe was.
That i was just like i'm just lucky you.
Know i always just told myself i was.
Lucky and i don't i can't say where that.
Came from.
Maybe it was my parents thing maybe my.
Parents are great at that man i think.
That's i mean like even for me i felt.
The same thing yeah like i mean.
Obviously there's a lot of work that.
Goes into which you i'm sure can admit.
To as well yeah but a lot of it's luck.
Right and i think that's the same case.
For everyone to a certain degree right.
And there's like a there's actually a.
Lot of people who are very successful.
That have the.
Imposter syndrome hmm and the reason why.
It's a real thing yeah yeah oh the.
Opposite is dunning creek kruger oh i.
Don't know what that is it's the it's.
Where somebody feels like they know a.
Lot they don't know that much so it's.
The opposite of them ha.
It's like they're deserving of.
Everything yeah and they're like i'm.
Very smart so it's people who like talk.
A lot but aren't well informed yeah so.
Okay i've met someone like that reason.
Exactly okay you know a lot of people.
Who are very successful well not a lot.
You know the people that are successful.
And had the impostor syndrome the reason.
Why they do wells because they don't.
Feel like they deserve it so they're.
Constantly working to try and get that.
Feeling like i deserve it right that's.
True it is a struggle though because i.
Feel like i'm constantly proving myself.
To who knows who but right yeah never.
Never really satisfied in the sense that.
I i feel like ooh i did it yeah i think.
I did this i think that's good because.
As long as you don't feel that there's.
More in life to accomplish more to look.
Forward to and build towards yeah yeah.
But like then i think about that makes.
Me think about like like floyd.
Mayweather right like he's great he's.
Greatness in boxing and he's he's all.
About him like i did this and but he's.
Still great you know i mean like i i'm.
Your biggest fan.
That's why i'm saying i unless some of.
The best athletes like michael jordan.
Yeah kobe bryant like not saying that.
They're saying you know oh i got lucky.
They're like i did this i feel like it's.
A happy middle ground right yeah like.
They've had aware that you earned it.
They to me i think their personalities.
Are not normal i think they have.
Something wrong with their breasts no.
Really i just really think that.
Something's wrong with them but that's.
Why they're so great yeah like you have.
Some kind of issues i mean if you think.
About what kanye says if kanye said what.
He said without his accomplishment he'd.
Be wearing different types of sweaters.
Can you imagine if kanye had impostor.
Syndrome.
Laughter.
Like him yeah i would there is something.
Likeable about that my dark disadvantage.
He would be a completely different.
Meaning yes what would you be doing if.
Youtube disappeared tomorrow if it.
Disappeared tomorrow i think um change.
Platform mixer let's say social media.
Disappeared hard i was boring it is i i.
Just went to to a retreat where for one.
Whole week monday through friday there.
Was no internet reception my entire.
Premises and i did that right after.
Vidcon i knew i was gonna need it i was.
Like i got a detox from this i and i it.
Was the longest i ever went without just.
Having some kind of technology.
Accessible it always descends it was up.
North in northern california yeah it.
Felt so good yes the first three days i.
Think i'd be miserable in first three.
Days i was reaching for my phone like.
Okay i got a look at that video see how.
I people liked my video i posted because.
I posted it right as i was driving out.
Of the reception i was like did i say.
Something the video that people are.
Going to notice and then i'm not gonna.
Be there to remove it but and we have.
The same thought just really yeah so.
You're not to your degree but yeah it's.
Pretty bad for me but it is cool to know.
That that's that's go through that yeah.
So for the first three days or so but.
But the last two days it felt really.
Nice to not look down at my phone and.
And also not waste time on social media.
Because that's that is most of what i do.
On social media is just waste time and.
Fill gaps i'm like if i if i'm walking.
Up a set of stairs i'm like well that's.
Kind of boring we've got my instagram or.
Like i'm like out of urine home like.
Well you know i got 15 seconds at most.
What about when you looked oh yeah.
That's one of the worst for me like i.
Know it's a habit but laughs it feels so.
Boring now i remember without i remember.
Looking at the wallpaper and coming up.
With that looks like yeah.
Kids and i don't even do that anymore.
Yeah but how was that it's great it was.
Great was pooping pooping was great hey.
I was like i was a present pooper but.
Don't bring their phone into the.
Bathroom really just took everything in.
Yeah let it all out at the same time it.
Was the whole experience was very nice.
And it gave me a little bit of.
Perspective and i brought a journal and.
I wrote down the ways that i felt and i.
Documented it in that sense and i just.
Referred to it i was like oh that's.
Really nice that's a it's a nice.
Reminder i wrote down how much i don't.
Like looking at my stats and how much i.
Felt really good not looking at social.
Media and feeling like i constantly had.
To be in the know and you know looking.
At the news just because i had to be in.
The know like that stuff doesn't.
Actually matter as much as i saw a.
Challenge the five day no but you know i.
But then that does goes like it there's.
Some meaning behind it.
Yeah the challenge that has meaning it.
Is that day no technology challenge but.
Then how are they document that sure it.
Does defeat the purpose because people.
Only one talking i spent a day without.
My phone who thought about doing the.
Video i spent today with people with.
That don't have cell phones or something.
That's like that's really not that.
Interesting actually they just walk.
