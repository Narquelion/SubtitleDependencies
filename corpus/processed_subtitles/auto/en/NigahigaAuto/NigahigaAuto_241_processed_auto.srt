Alito.

Guest miss arden cho and i said we.
Shouldn't bring in but she's been she.
Doesn't she doesn't bark she's not a.
Normal dog yeah and she follows me every.
Was it yeah she's the runt of the litter.
Music.
No i think it's because she grew up on.
Set with me that is not the reason is.
Like you trained her to be quiet you.
Didn't not treat her she was always like.
That i don't know if i trained her to be.
Quiet i definitely didn't but i think.
Shooting always used to being around a.
Lot of things happening in production.
And i think she got used to it you so.
You don't think that the reason why.
She's quiet has nothing to do with the.
Fact that she's the runt of the litter.
And yeah well i thought she was deaf for.
The first like two years she never.
Burned she's the best on looks like she.
Just popped a couple of leather you see.

In not so much the instagram thing i.
Mean i i know that i'm dreaming and.
You're lucy i can't get out of it no and.
Then i can't make things happen the way.
I want to i'm sure you know i know like.
I know it's a dream.
I know when i'm in the dream i know.
Because i always have these dreams that.
My teeth are falling out and like i know.
That it's a dream cuz something terrible.
Is happening that i'm like this just.
Wouldn't happen in real life you can't.
Change it and i can't change it huh it's.
Taraf dude i had a weird but i know that.
I'm in the dream this is not even this.
Dream was very like big to me but it.
Seems so lame basically we were at.
Ryan's house all chillin hanging out and.
Then they're like paco we got a gift for.
You and i was like what and he gives me.
A like a small box and i open it and.
It's a business card.
What does it have your name on it yes it.
Says ceo like i can finally buy props.
And.
Uh-oh y'all business card we're both.
Thinking the same thing i was thinking.
Like a like a card that says like oh.
Yeah.
Paco rhpc a credit card well that's kind.
Of based on like reality that's like.
Real life because i everybody never.
Makes sense.
Usually mine don't but this one was like.
They trust me sorry.
Maybe maybe in a couple years i don't.
Want to get back into the dream thing.
Yeah married we've been talking about.
That i feel like we always end up there.
Even with like david we started talking.
About it you guys are weird like that no.
I just think dreams are so interesting.
Anyway what have you been up to people.
Want to know people have been asking for.
You to be on this since the announcement.
Well they've been asking for arden jay.
Oh i'm sorry i didn't know her.
Yeah who is she she's like harry j.
They've been asking for you and why.
Don't we get a like quick introductory.
To like for some people maybe i don't.
Know who you are yeah.
So just to start i mean arden arden cho.
Is a actor slash i guess a lot of things.
Actor slash singer slash ceo you ceo yes.
You should talk about that actually took.
Over a company go ahead oh talk about.
That i searched so four years ago i.
Co-founded a company called leonard in.
Church yes we make watches and make dog.
Collars and it's like a lifestyle brand.
That is bringing affordable quality.
Pieces to you why watches though so i.
Collected watches since i was in high.
School i think everyone should wear.
Watch and low key judge people and they.
Don't wear watches because i feel like.
They don't value time and that they.
Don't respect people it's more of a.
Fashion what's the first thing on but.
But that's a thing i feel like let's say.
You're in a meeting or let's say we're.
In this podcast or you're in class i.
Think it's really rude to pull out your.
Phone and check the time true but i.
Think it's fine to like yeah but if.
You're to buy your watch okay nobody.
Checks their time like this i do.
I am wearing it now to support guys go.
To leonard church is calm it is better.
And support she needs people to buy.
Watches because they do company that she.
Just over it's not a new company she.
Just took over as ceo though right so we.
We've been going for about four years.
And then a couple years into it i mean.
It's your it's a typical small start-up.
Company we were bootstrapping a very.
Very small team of friends and after a.
Couple years everyone just sort of got.
Tired and we kind of it was kind of a.
Side project yeah everybody was a side.
Thing it was hard to really like nobody.
Was full-time and then about i think it.
Around like 2017 2018 it was pretty much.
Out of standstill and so around 2018.
When basically my partner's were like.
Hey i think we are all kind of you know.
It was fun to try but we're kind of over.
It i felt like you know we didn't really.
Get to do what i wanted to do with a.
Company i always wanted to make all the.
Watches that i loved and hopefully other.
Leather goods as well and so it was a.
Good start but i felt like there were a.
Lot of things i didn't get to try yet.
And so yeah at the end of last year we.
Slowly trying to just we slowly.
Transitioned and i took over the company.
Yeah top of the year so yeah it's new.
And we're going through a lot of changes.
I have a new team now but it's very.
Small very small well just like it but.
The watches are actually mad dope like.
Whenever i go on dates i make sure to.
Wear it yeah pocket and then the girls.
Like dang like - you're a pretty.
Disgusting person but that watch you're.
Not going to know they do not say that.
Yeah you're right they're like you know.
What these watches are like they look.
Expensive but that's the thing i like.
About that i mean that your whole motto.
Was trying to get stuff that's not read.
It because watches are like so expensive.
Some of them but that's a thing the.
Reason when i started making watches was.
Because since i collected watches since.
I was younger you know eventually as i.
Got older all my dream watches were.
Getting so so expensive i mean they're.
More expensive than cars and houses it's.
Insane and she still bought them i mean.
No not a collector i mean not all of.
Them that teen wolf money huh no she was.
On teen wolf for people definitely not.
Enough money.
No but damn shame it's other hard worked.
Money no but i think for me i started.
Realizing that as i was learning about.
The watch business it was just so.
Inflated the pricing and i realized.
You're really paying for the name and i.
Wanted to make great quality timepieces.
That i could sort of interchange and mix.
With the nicer pieces i have because you.
Know it's like if you have a luxury car.
Wants to say like a ferrari or a porsche.
You don't always drive that everyday.
That might be your weekend car so i.
Wanted to make a watch that essentially.
Could mix in with higher-end watches but.
Never feel like i was going lower in.
Quality if that makes sense.
Like our automatic watch i feel like our.
Manufacturer advised us to sell it.
Around like fifteen hundred two thousand.
Dollars and we solved for like right.
Under $400 so i just wanted to make it.
Really affordable and that's a watch.
That will last you a lifetime it's.
Automatic you don't need a new battery.
And so yeah good i'm really proud of it.
So okay that's good yeah.
But i want out only hears about the we.
Talked about you mentioned teen wolf a.
Little bit that kind the watches are.
Dope and everything but you know i know.
People care about team oh yeah a lot of.
People want to know about that and do.
You kind of like consider that like your.
Start like that really opened up acting.
For you well i i feel like if i look.
Back at the last 10 years of my career.
There's definitely like two moments i.
Mean one actually is when i met you guys.
And we work together good stuff yeah i.
Think that was a huge yeah for ass that.
Was a huge turning point because i.
Learned a lot about sort of that online.
World which started music and youtube.
For me and that really kept me afloat.
For almost like 6-7 years in la and if.
It wasn't for ryan and wang fu.
Encouraging me to pursue youtube.
Platform i don't know if tim wolfe would.
Have happened because i think at the.
Time when i auditioned for teen wolf i.
Was in a place where i was actually.
Ready to quit acting i was gonna go on.
Tour.
I just finished recording my album and i.
Was ready to sort of do shows and have.
Fun and not do that audition grind so i.
Went into that audition like i don't.
Even care talk about that audition.
Because i yeah you did but talk about.
That audition gregor's a lot of people.
Don't know and realize i mean you you.
Tell me all the time when you know.
You're.
I mean you're nice enough where a lot of.
People reach out like random people and.
I even i'm like why are you gonna go.
Meet this random person well if they're.
Sketch and usually it's like some you.
Know younger girl who looked up to you.
Because she watched teen wolf where she.
Watches chicago man whatever it is and.
They hit you up and they want to be an.
Actress or an actor and you go and meet.
With them which is very nice of you i.
Still think it can be sketch well you.
Always think he always thinks the worst.
He's always like well i and this person.
Is going to kill you and i'm like it's.
Like a 23 year old girl might be.
Actually i have met a crazy girl and she.
Did the same thing she emailed me like.
Every month for about a year and then i.
Met her and she turned out to be psycho.
Like actually that's what i yeah so that.
That has happened it is the nice side of.
You that does that and i think people a.
Lot of times you were telling me that.
They a lot of people just kind of assume.
You know if you work hard at this thing.
It's gonna happen but that's not.
Necessarily the case so why don't you.
Talk about that whole actor life yeah i.
Would say acting wow it really is a.
Grind i don't think there ever is a.
Point in your career unless you're sort.
Of in that top one percentile where it's.
Not really a grind we're at that point.
You're sort of getting offers and you're.
Really choosing when you say 1% are you.
Talking like a listers yeah your top top.
A listers i mean i still see stars at.
Auditions and i'm like like who time.
Like i was like oh you're totally gonna.
Get it i'm like it's cool though.
I would book you to like you're way.
Funnier sure you're not saying that no.
No i would oh no no i'm like thinking it.
Oh that was a producer and i'm.
Auditioning like i'd probably that girl.
But also to its i'm being realistic but.
She's been in a bunch of movies i'm.
There's a few people that i'm like yeah.
I booked her tell us one no i don't why.
No i think it's gonna offend them is it.
Private auditions are not private are.
They sometimes because i think some.
People you might be embarrassed if.
People knew that the auditions are.
Certain things i just want to respect.
People you never know but yeah basically.
Back to the audition grind i mean.
I think a lot of people think that you.
Just care about a project you audition.
And then you book it but it's definitely.
Not like that i think there's just a.
Long process where there are auditions.
There's callbacks there is producer.
Sessions director sessions there's.
There's so many sessions until you're in.
The mix and then when you're in the mix.
For tv they'll then choose a few for.
Like chemistry tests or screen testing.
And then go from there and teen wolf was.
A really tough process actually i.
Auditioned for it i think at least three.
Times before the chem read that i had.
With tyler posey and then even after.
That i think the network or the producer.
Somebody wasn't quite sold i think it.
Might have been like an age thing or the.
Fact that i wasn't japanese either way.
We ended up having to but you are.
Japanese so yeah they actually had me.
Come all the way to set they had the set.
Team do my hair and makeup they were.
Amazing they like put me basically on.
Set and we ended up shooting our.
Audition scene with like the actual crew.
Is amazing like they went above and.
Beyond to really fight to get me that.
Opportunity so i'm really thankful for.
That and i would definitely say an.
Epochal asked earlier but i would say.
Teen wolf was at least in my acting.
Career probably the biggest moment that.
Sort of set the tone for i guess the.
Start of my career and what i felt like.
I don't know i don't wanna say like it.
Defines me but i definitely think it's.
Something that i'll always look back and.
Say oh i'm really thankful for that.
Experience and i'm so happy to have been.
Cure you kimura especially because 11 12.
Years ago when i moved out to la i never.
Imagined that i'd actually be on not.
Only a tv show but a hit tv show and to.
Be a series regular and a cool janna.
Cool character brightly action-based.
Like superpower character right and the.
Thing that's really fun about that is.
She actually i don't think was intended.
To have a lot of action and stuff but i.
Think the writers and the creators of.
The show they're really good about.
Incorporating what the actual actor.
Knows how to do so i remember by like.
Season four they'd be like hey what.
Weapons do you know and because i knew.
How to use nunchucks they like random.
Threw that in there and i started season.
4 play with nunchucks and so that was a.
Lot of fun so i feel like kira sort of.
Evolved to be like a version of me you.
Know and a version of her and so i shall.
Always be like special to me kira kira.
Kira goes unless you'll come you kimura.
You know you kumuda yeah i can't even.
Say about speaking about that i know.
You're japanese what did you take no so.
You know what man you're stealing this i.
Was gonna make a video about it okay.
It's all good no no but you know what.
We're gonna announce it on on off the.
Pill podcast right now because you know.
It's some super top secret information.
Is it i think you know help you actually.
Cuz you can more roles now i guess.
Freshly appropriating something you know.
Like for that i don't think so right no.
I mean i just don't really care i will.
Say though it's disappointing that as.
Asian american actors we are limited to.
Only play your own ethnicity when.
American actors or british actors or.
Australian actors really play anything.
That can pass as white so i think that's.
Really unfair i don't think i should.
Play a role that's let's say filipino or.
Indian cuz obviously i don't think i can.
Physically pass for that but speaking of.
The dna test i took three and there was.
One that was like junk it actually just.
Said you were a hundred percent asian.
And i was like great i knew that and.
Then there was one that said i was 60%.
Japanese and 30% chinese vietnamese like.
I think like 10% and like mongolian.
Makes random stuff no korean and then.
There was another test that said i was.
Like 40 percent korean and then a bunch.
Of other stuff and japanese - japanese.
Yeah but was the consistent right so the.
Consistence thing was that i was mostly.
Japanese and chinese so i was like wait.
That's so weird so i'm not korean and.
Then i asked my mom she was like hmm i.
Was like what i thought she was gonna be.
Like woah we're cory on but she was just.
Like you know in asia everybody is just.
You know where you live you're korean.
Culturally you are korean you speak.
Korean you're i mean you know more.
Korean people who would speak fluent.
Korean say that you're koreans like.
Perfect we can get the homework hotel no.
That's the next i can hear it it was.
Awkward cuz they came out of nowhere.
Oh but ryan's big screen no i don't yeah.
He does come on xiety okay did i speak.
Korean - yeah what do you know beyond a.
Pope in 30 that means i mean herbert oh.
Yeah you probably get that a lot i get.
That a lot.
No but really though you were saying i.
Mean in actor life and this is a true.
Thing you've been turned down roles.
Because you weren't a certain type oh.
Yeah.
I mean any of you weren't chinese or.
Technically if you were to show the dna.
Results you could be like i have.
Japanese i have cuz your character on.
Teen wolf was japanese right korean well.
Just happen that's the thing she was.
Supposed to be full japanese she's.
Curico muda but because i got casted for.
The show they actually made her half.
Korean half japanese which was awesome.
But i don't think it was necessary but.
It did bring a really cool storyline.
Talking about japanese heritage and why.
We took my mother's last name versus our.
Fathers and we had some really great.
Episodes about that and so i think it.
Turned out better but i don't think it.
Was necessary because i think if she was.
Full japanese i think i could have still.
Passed is that right so yeah i think.
About when people because there's a huge.
Community especially asian community who.
Get really upset - oh yeah i think.
That's part of the reason why people.
Want to cast exactly what it's said to.
Be but i mean what do you think about.
That i mean there's so many people who.
Are you know it's hard it's like a it's.
It's hard to balance that it's like you.
Don't want people to appropriate like.
You don't want it to be whitewashed but.
At the same time where do you draw the.
Line.
You know i think you draw the line when.
Creatively you will sort of harm the.
Project for example like there is a part.
That i've you know politely turned down.
Because the role was mandarin-speaking.
And they were only going to give me like.
Two to three months of dialect coaching.
And i didn't think that was enough for.
Me to be able to truly pass.
And i knew about three actresses that i.
Thought were amazing and perfect for the.
Part and friends and so i just pass it.
Along and it was great for them but i.
Think for me i knew that as an actor i.
Couldn't do that well and so i think i.
Think for me and i hope other actors it.
Really just comes down to can you tell.
The story well can you tell it without.
Sort of disturbing yes the same idea.
Right right right.
The authenticity of where that whole.
Project is coming yeah so i mean i think.
If it's a character where yeah i mean.
Even if it's someone who even though i.
Speak korean if the film is about.
Someone who like comes from korea to.
Speak english i don't think that i would.
Probably be the best for the part he's.
Going to be other actors that are great.
For it but i think if it's a girl from.
Hong kong and she's supposed to be.
Ethnically chinese but she's in america.
Or even if she grew up in hong kong but.
She went to like international school i.
Think i could play that because i speak.
English and i've been to hong kong and.
And now when you went to casting you.
Should bring in your dna results and be.
Like look i am actually i think most.
People like i mean because our parents.
You know a lot especially first gen not.
That mines are but a lot of parents of.
Friends that i know are very proud.
Obviously they go 8 asians are just i.
Mean they fight amongst each other yeah.
That's the main problem i think.
Underlying issue is there's a lot of.
Racism within the asian culture there's.
So much racism even from koreans to.
Korean americans and people in china to.
Chinese americans and then not to.
Mention you know korea and japan and you.
Know etc etc there's so much racism that.
Is within the asian cultures that causes.
All this animosity so the issue really.
Isn't casting because i think right now.
And what i always tell people is we just.
Need more stories you don't i mean and i.
Think for example i just give and a good.
Friend of mine she is not korean but she.
Plays the lead in soul-searching which.
Is about koreans going to korea to find.
Out about their identity but their.
Adopted koreans and she absolutely kills.
The film yeah and it makes me so happy.
I've seen it like seven times and i'm so.
Proud of her.
As someone who is ethnically korean i'm.
Really really happy that she portrayed.
That character so well and i don't think.
Anyone else could have done it as well.
As she did and to me if that movie helps.
Her build her career then she will one.
Day be at a place where she can then.
Talk about who she really is.
And she speaks mandarin she does a lot.
Of things and now we understand more.
About asians you know i'm saying whereas.
I think if we don't if we block those.
Opportunities and if asians are the ones.
Complaining about miss casting then.
Casting directors are just gonna cast.
White and i've heard this a lot like.
They'll be like oh it's an anime we need.
Japanese and they're like oh we can't.
Find japanese actors and you're korean.
And you're chinese they're like we just.
Don't want to upset people so we're.
Gonna upset people anyways we'll just.
Cast white and so i'm always like so.
Frustrated when i hear that and so.
That's why one of the reasons why like i.
Love sharing sort of casting information.
With a lot of my actor friends is that i.
Hope it stays ethnic because we have a.
Smaller pool to choose from yeah i think.
That's why when other s like i think.
That's why when caucasians are like oh.
Well that role was supposed to be white.
And it went to a black actor or went to.
An asian actor and they get upset about.
It i'm like are you serious right now.
We have less opportunities to choose.
From to begin with yeah you know i mean.
They're seeing it they're seeing it from.
A like principle standard there's you.
Know because there's such a heavy push.
Behind anything there's always gonna be.
A counter action i mean i agree.
Obviously they've dominated the realm.
But i can see what they're trying to say.
Like based on principles like well.
Technically you know if that person in.
The story is asian and you cast white.
You guys would be upset so why are you.
Allowing this white person in this story.
Being cast as something else so i could.
I could see what they're trying to say.
But i also see what you're trying to say.
I think you're never gonna i think.
There's gonna be a lot that disagree.
With you yeah i've already seen it and i.
Just like i just sit back just like this.
Is theirs.
To me i think i mean it's it's very.
Important to your specific job yeah and.
So i wanted you to speak about it.
Because you deal with that all the time.
Oh of course and and of course there's.
Always a part of me that's going to try.
To be considerate of what people will.
Feel and you know how it might be.
Perceived but i always tell people you.
Have to think about it this way.
Wouldn't you want a show like.
Fresh-off-the-boat to exist and to be.
Great as it is or them to have just not.
Done it because they couldn't find the.
Father.
Cuz randall park is great he's so great.
But he's not chinese nice korean but i.
Think he's great and so i don't think.
That should be an issue you're saying.
Also shouldn't be because most of those.
People know most asian ethnicities are.
Not a hundred percent anything right.
Right and so that's why i'm saying i.
Think the people who are upset are the.
Ones that are extremely prideful and i'm.
Sorry to say this racist yeah it's it's.
Well it's people would take a lot i.
Think this is where it comes from it's.
Parents would take so much pride in.
Their culture which is a great thing but.
I mean if you're really breaking it down.
I think that's about what it is based on.
It's like this is a culturally korean.
Thing but like like just like you you're.
Culturally korean but technically you.
Might not be full korean right.
Technically unless we find out later.
Down the road all these dna tests or all.
Scans i kind of felt like there's a.
Possibility i have heard that there's.
Just not enough data for asian people.
Which is why the tests all came out so.
Different right so i'm i was recommended.
To do it again in a couple years once.
The data pool has increased the data.
Pool yeah all right well going on to.
Back to acting and stuff i guess a lot.
Something that a lot of people were very.
Curious about is like what pushed you.
Into this direction and did you get.
Support from your friends and family.
Because that's something that you know.
Look at that little smirk on your face i.
Know you got something to say no i mean.
It's just i don't know sometimes now.
That i'm older i think it's funny when i.
Look back and think how did i end up.
Here and how did i start this you know.
It seems pretty crazy but yeah i mean.
Growing up i loved telling stories i.
Love making people laugh i think i would.
Always sort of act out the date of my.
Parents and since i was like three or.
Four they said i was always singing.
Around the house i knew i.
To be a performer but then when i was in.
High school in college i was too shy to.
Sort of join the drama club and i didn't.
Think i'd be good enough so i never.
Really auditioned it was really scared.
To audition even also wanted to be with.
No asians right in the midwest and so i.
Grew up really confused about my.
Identity but um i think in college after.
Graduating i felt like and that's a.
Really long story but there was someone.
Who really encouraged me even issues yep.
She's ours putting her dog down like put.
Layers it's really i'm wearing an off.
The pill.
Oh a shout out shirt and drinking water.
In an off the podcast monk thanks.
So until their due upon third bunch get.
Off the pill no he's not okay sorry so.
Back to acting yeah it's a really long.
Story but i was encouraged to pursue.
What brought me joy and try to do.
Something good and radical with it and i.
Wanted to yeah hopefully make it a.
Friends not just as a female but as.
Animation american i grew up really.
Confused about my identity i thought i.
Was i think i thought i was white i was.
Like 20 i know it sounds really weird.
But i mean you're i don't know if you.
Want to talk about it but you told me.
That story about your kindergarten.
Teacher or something oh yeah i have.
Experienced so much racism my entire.
Life yeah i think when i was in.
Kindergarten i had a teacher sort of.
Split the class up in groups she was.
Like okay everybody with blue eyes on.
This corner everybody with hazel eyes.
Here and everybody with brown eyes over.
Here and i was like oh i have brown eye.
So i went over in the brown eyes group.
And she was like what are you doing i.
Was like um going in the brown a's game.
She's like no your eyes are black you're.
All by yourself and i was like.
What i'm like fives i'm like crying.
Inside but also just like to shock to.
Actually cry but that was sort of like.
The beginning of where i was like oh i.
Am the only one that yeah different but.
Then i think growing up i really wanted.
To fit in and i was born amarillo.
Grew up in dallas so mostly he lived in.
Plano but a lot of i might be tripping.
But i thought there was a lot of asians.
In dallas now used in there are like 10.
Years after me oh okay is that what yeah.
We each me up think about this at least.
The teacher recognized you did have eyes.
She could have said you have no eyes.
That's because i'm an asian with big.
Eyes they're all natural yeah whatever.
Don't be hating paco just i'm stating.
I'm saying she could have that's true.
That's true i could have gotten even.
Worse you could have said ching chong.
Ding dong yeah oh dude you just went.
Racist again yeah i've gotten some of.
Those kinds of comments even with my.
Name they always try to make arden cho.
Somehow asian adriene known chau and i'm.
Like what where did you get all those.
Extra letters that was their insults no.
It would be actual teachers try to read.
My name oh and they would always say.
Ciao ciao and even this morning i was on.
The phone with the bank and they were.
Like chu and i'm like it's ch oh cho.
There's no you but they kept saying miss.
Chu miss chu clothes though grew up not.
Seeing asian americans on tv or media i.
Felt like i just didn't belong in this.
World and i felt like an alien and i.
Think there are two ways you can go with.
Life can either sit back and complain.
About it or you can get involved and do.
Something and so i was like i'm gonna.
Take a leap of faith and try to get.
Involved and do something and i moved to.
La it's like no money and two suitcases.
And didn't know anybody found a roommate.
On craigslist who was crazy and then and.
I cried every day for five years yep and.
Then i filmed a youtube video yep and.
Then i started making youtube videos and.
Then it works jobs and here i am today.
And now you're on chicago med oh yeah.
Wow that was a really good timing on the.
Applause paco i'm a comedian all right.

Impressions of each other.
And then second impressions of each.
Other after reconnecting through.
Facebook okay.
First impressions were facebook yeah the.
First time when i ate you up she has a.
Better memory so last time we talked.
About we talked when we first met that.
You you said i talked about this how we.
Have different and i said i was gonna.
Let you talk tell your side how we think.
We met at different times i think we met.
Well i i know i think i know that we did.
Not meet do you know add a casting thing.
Because wong foo was casting for agents.
Of secret stuff yeah we did emily.
Together i auditioned and we read.
Together i don't and i was like i do not.
Recall i think my first impression of.
You was just like oh he's just like this.
Guy and i don't know what the hell think.
I'm sorry but i'm there for like an.
Audition and so yeah i don't think i was.
Thinking much of it i just want to do my.
Part well and i just thought didn't go.
Home and cry again i know ii swore that.
I saw your audition via tape and not in.
Person that's why i think our stories.
Vary i think we should ask one of the.
Guys i was there like i know it must.
Have been kristen was there and i think.
Phil was there so we'll talk to one of.
Those guys yeah films i mean first.
Impression of ryan was he's just some.
Guy yeah that's what she just said.
That's what you so bad i mean no i mean.
I just was like oh but you know what i.
Can't even remember so yeah he doesn't.
Even remember me so obviously he.
Obviously i was not memorable and wow oh.
Wow this is a real actor cuz i haven't.
Even worked with actors and i wasn't an.
Actor i was just like oh man i better.
Like really i was intimidated not just.
By her but like all the other actors i.
Feel like you were scared of me a little.
I was scared of the whole situation.
Because even like getting a sound.
And i wasn't used to that stuff i was.
Just like oh i better actually learn my.
Lines paco knows how and i'm new in.
Videos i'll have stuff to that right but.
I'll just go off-script he'll go like.
Line after line and he'll mess it up so.
Much and i'll go like sometimes it'll.
Change the story yeah let's do this now.
Yeah and then it messes everything up so.
Uh yeah all right i was more worried.
About that i think at the time all right.
And then uh so you guys are dating and.
Then there's a steak story which steak.
Are you talking about the first time.
Around the first time oh i think that's.
Funny i mean we'd even say that we've.
Dated the first time around that's.
Always like well we kind of dated yeah.
No i mean it wasn't even like it was.
Just like we were getting to know each.
Other but i was only considered dating.
Yeah and i think we wanted different.
Things and honestly we didn't really.
Know what we wanted i mean i knew what i.
Wanted back then back then i wanted to.
Get married and have like 500 kids and.
Like it was just five really five it's.
Point you had your team you had your not.
That i knew but you had a very strict.
Plan for your future and you send.
Reminders you had reminders for it i.
Don't know if you want to bring that up.
Or not yeah no i was a little weird um i.
Basically thought that i'd be married.
With kids by the time i was 23 and i met.
Ryan when i was i think about weight 94.
Yeah about that age and so i think at.
That point i was really feeling rushed.
Where i was just like whoever i date.
Next like we're gonna get married and so.
Unless we're gonna get married i don't.
Want to waste my time and so i think i.
Was a little bit kind of mean to you.
Because i kind of was like don't waste.
My time cuz you young i wasn't mean then.
Again i wasn't mean back you were gonna.
Meet at the end though i was because i.
Was a little annoyed i was just like not.
You i wasn't i was very like oh you were.
Not used to girls saying no to you.
You're not used to their know-how.
Shannon no i wasn't used to girls.
Pretending like they they liked you a.
Lot and then the next day they don't and.
Then they like you again okay in his can.
You can my defense yes it's.
Not that i was pretending to like you.
And we've talked about this it was that.
There was a part of me that didn't like.
You you made me laugh and you were so.
Fun and i thought you were really.
Intelligent and charming and awesome but.
Then there was this other part of me.
That was like no you have to think with.
Your head scheduled he's too young he's.
Not ready for anything serious like.
Don't waste your time you're only.
Getting older time is ticking tick tick.
Tick you know so i think there was just.
I was really torn and so that was why i.
Definitely wasn't gonna give i was nine.
Twenty maybe at the time and like i so.
Liked it the weird thing that was like a.
Lot of awkward things were like we'd go.
Not like we were dating but we'd go on.
Like dates.
I guess that's dating yeah like because.
I'm underage and like to her she would.
Make me feel like like i mean i was like.
I would feel embarrassed cuz we do like.
Some of her friends and they would all.
Be like a little older i mean not like.
24 25 they're older than you that's why.
Yeah a lot of my friends are older and.
So then we were in situations where they.
Were much older than you yeah like like.
Seven eight years and then i'm just like.
Oh i can't get wine i'm sorry and i.
Think at that time like i was really not.
Okay with that either so that bothered.
Me a lot.
I would bother me too though it's a.
Little different when the guys older i.
Think oh no that's sexist.
No no but i think it's true right like.
It's a little it's not as as weird for.
The girl i guess but even then if you.
Were a 25 year old guy or 20 40 or.
Whatever and you were doing somebody who.
Was 20 and you went to a restaurant with.
All your friends who are like 28 29 and.
You guys all got wine and this person.
Gets carded and you can't even be there.
That would be a pretty awkward for you.
Yeah wouldn't it yeah i mean if that was.
A girl mhm.
Yeah but i think as girls it just feels.
Less weird i think it just maybe it's.
Sexist but i think i just really had one.
She with you being younger i was young.
Yeah but obviously all right and i.
Caught her and now yeah right grandpa.
Was so old and boring like i think i'm.
Way more fun but i'm also old and boring.
So now we're both old.
Sassie baby okay well roast you so hard.
Does fun things i do a lot of fun things.
Yeah i'm trying to do more fun things.
You already do i don't know why you're.
Suddenly mean i want to do more fun.
Things well because i didn't live my 20.
Is very fun i think i was so ready to.
Like grow up and be an adult but i.
Didn't get to have a lot of fun so now.
In my 30s i'm trying to enjoy life more.
And have fun like i made ryan to a.
Staycation yesterday yep.
And he's really happy about it obviously.
No i mean it's not but it was great we.
Had a nice dinner we went to get.
Massages made a couples massage it was.
Really romantic yeah we i just always.
Thought that such a weird concept.
Staycation where you get a hotel in the.
Same city that you live in yeah and the.
Part of me i mean i got used to because.
She likes doing that but apart me and.
First was just like it doesn't make.
Sense we have a regular bed like a.
Cleaner one probably i don't need i.
Think about those kind of things when.
I'm walking around hotel when you do.
Barefoot i'm like man i know there's.
Probably spit and like all kind of who.
Knows what's on that floor there's no.
Way they cleaned it very well in between.
The hour that we had they definitely big.
They don't they don't clean the remotes.
That stuff bothers me they don't know.
Any    in the curtains but it looks.
Okay to make it i yeah i don't know i.
Just love hotels and i love room service.
And so like making a mess and not.
Cleaning yeah i mean i think it's.
Because okay a little bit is that i.
Don't have to clean it because i'm the.
Type that once it's messy like i need to.
Clean it right away that's why i like.
Even when i'm hosting people i feel like.
I'm always cleaning the whole time yeah.
Because i want to stay clean but then.
When i'm in a hotel i feel like it's.
Okay because it's not my house but i.
Don't really make it i get it i mean i.
Get the whole staycation thing for all.
You couples out there if you can't get.
Away for a long time well i don't know.
And i think you like it i don't know if.
Everybody would like that well i think.
It's about making time to spend time.
Together i mean for those of you guys.
Who don't know we've been long-distance.
For a really long time and ryan works.
365 days out of the year he worked on.
His birthday he works on holidays he.
Walks every single day this is work.
Bears work so he works.
And so if i'm like let's take a trip and.
Let's go on a vacation i've done it.
Really hard for him to take more than.
You know a couple days off and so.
Staycations are better because then he.
Only loses one workday or he can like.
Today part of the staycation and then we.
Work in the afternoon and so yeah but i.
Also admire that about ryan so i know.
This is not a full roasting session ryan.
Is very hardworking and that's one of.
The things that makes me like him so ya.
Know because all of a sudden i felt.
Really shy let's talk about paco now.
Part of what arden does for you is.
Whenever you get into like a.
Relationship of some sort let's not talk.
About don't listen he drops everything.
For a girl because when he is so in love.
But i'm telling you people that's the.
Way to do it see yep you need balance.
Let me defend myself no this is now.
Roasting paco time yep but i mean talk.
About it because i think that's very.
Relatable for a lot of people especially.
People who i mean people don't date as.
Much i feel like right dating is like.
Happening less and less like i guess.
Exclusive rio date yeah real yeah not.
Like tinder hookups yeah well i think.
The generation has just changed a lot.
And it's really weird because there's.
Just too many options and everybody is.
Sort of always like one foot in one foot.
Out or like always kind of look in that.
Way in though does everybody i want to.
Go mow they have fun right you don't.
Want to commit and it's sort of like you.
Go on a couple days but it's just like.
Dinner or whatever and then you're like.
Oh but let me see if i can meet somebody.
Better yeah but i think that's why i.
Like we work because we're both like old.
School and we're just kind of like you.
Can take out school you're both old.
Things but also like we're too lazy to.
Like meet new people like we never did.
I've never had tinder coffee meets bagel.
Any of those i don't even know which way.
To swipe and i don't think you've ever.
Had that either mm-hmm oh i missed that.
You phase of no tinder weed that was a.
Combination.
Yeah yeah we missed it and honestly.
There's like a small part of me that's.
Like oh they could kind of be fun but.
Also it's very overwhelming and scary to.
Think that you're just out there and.
People can like just sway wait yeah you.
Yes or no and it's just so like i know.
Feels really unauthentic i'm sorry i'm.
Sorry no but i mean i have a lot of.
Friends who found their soul mates on.
Those sites and so i think it's great if.
You match with the right type of person.
But back to paco paco just he just has a.
Big heart and i know you guys all think.
He's like nasty and that he's just cool.
You guys audience they just probably.
Think paco is a mess but he's actually.
Actually pretty sweet he's really sweet.
And he anything he goes above and beyond.
And maybe a little too much so i always.
Tell people like if you like someone or.
If you love someone your instinct it's.
Like sort of give everything and do.
Everything but i always tell people like.
Paco you just kind of like reel it back.
A little bit oh no definitely like you.
Give too much too early no okay then.
It's like okay bye let me defend myself.
Then so about a year ago it was real bad.
Oh yeah i know yeah like i would ask.
Heart in like all types of stuff and.
Everything and i would be like going out.
To la all the time like for this girl.
And everything and i would just give way.
Too much and arden was like like why are.
You doing that you don't even know what.
This person likes you or anything like.
Make them want to work for you type of.
Thing and it totally made sense and as.
Of recent like i i'm focusing on myself.
A lot more and when you start working on.
Yourself and this is all things that i'm.
Kind of like learning from you you know.
So just to show you that i listen and i.
Do know i'm so when you work on yourself.
You make yourself the prize you make.
Yourself important and other people will.
See that and value that in you and.
They're like oh i do want to like you.
Know get to know this person like you.
Know how are they so focused and passion.
Is something that a lot of people.
Respect and admire and find attractive.
And you know i got a lot of passion good.
I like that you do listen sometimes see.
And that's why i'm a lot better.
Now i'm proud of you paco and that is.
The basic relationship that you guys.
Have had.
Paco coming to you you telling him the.
Same thing him not listening and then a.
Year later now you've kind of listened.
Yeah i'm a lot better now okay and for.
Those of you guys out there yeah i feel.
Like if you are you know wanting to date.
And get into a relationship i always say.
The best advice is love yourself know.
What you want and who you are and if you.
Respect yourself somebody else will as.
Well yeah but you also really have to.
Love yourself i know it sounds silly a.
Lot of people are searching for love.
What does that mean love yourself i.
Think it just means you have to be at.
Least semi happy with who you are like.
If you don't even like who you are how.
Can you expect someone else to like you.
Let alone love you so i think a lot of.
People jump into relationships to feel.
Like they are loved and to fill this.
Void but then what happens is you then.
Put so much pressure on the other person.
To love you to this extent that isn't.
Really capable for them to do on their.
Own but i think when two people are you.
Know adults and they kind of know who.
They are and they're balanced and they.
Have this healthy view on themselves and.
Life and they come together and they can.
Hopefully have a balanced relationship.
That makes sense yep what i've heard is.
Like it's complimentary exactly instead.
Of having somebody complete you where.
They're filling voids right you already.
You're like very secure and who you are.
And somebody makes your life better.
Exactly but without them you're okay.
With them it's better so i want to know.
How you guys kind of compliment each.
Other you know like you guys are you.
Guys are similar but different and so.
Similar it was so different yeah no but.
You're similar in the fact that you're.
Both boring.
We are both boring i don't think i am i.
Think i'm super interesting you're them.
Are you serious you are the most.
Predictable person i ever met get a hold.
Of ryan i know he's either pooping or.
Playing video games sleeping or playing.
Basketball it makes sense that's a lot.
Of things like you just named that's a.
Lot of things anyway i don't think i'm.
That boring but yeah we're very.
Different she does a lot of things she.
Has a tiny group of friend she has a.
Huge group of friends that i she has so.
Many friends that i have.
Such a hard time i mean i don't want to.
Sound racist but a lot of them are asian.
And and very like hard for me to.
Remember like three different jenn.
Friends well that's that i think in your.
Defense.
I understand i actually do have like.
Seven friends named jen so that's a.
Little hard and two of them are jenn.
Married to ben so that's really.
Confusing too well they're both yujin.
Right so jenn in and they're both.
Married to guys named ben yeah so i get.
Them mixed up a bit and they get.
Offended yeah jim and then gentry but.
You know it's fine i know so funny i.
Didn't know that her last name was jay.
Yeah all right well thanks yeah so you.
Hey you've even answer the question what.
Do you like about her what do you like.
About her what do i like that was a.
Question no he looks so upset about that.
Question took what do i like there's so.
Many things he's like how dare you make.
Me pick one know what didn't know what.
It was the that was the original.
Question.
Yeah paco is asking how we complement.
Each other how we make things work and.
What you like i think you get me to do a.
Lot of things that i don't want to.
Initially initially but then it but then.
It helps i think it helps because you're.
Right i mean i think if you weren't.
Around i wouldn't do a lot of these.
Things that inspire me essentially even.
If even if it's not a good thing like.
Something i don't want to do it'll still.
Inspire me to create something yeah you.
Know i think that there's a there's a.
Lot of that and learning to be more.
Openly compassionate i think i think.
Blacc naturally i always go logic i.
Think you myself but i feel like yeah.
And she's a feeling so we're so.
Obviously so i've learned to be more but.
That's like a kind of normal.
Relationship that isn't normally no it's.
Not the girly feely i know you're saying.
But we're not like feely.
But then that's a thing like we're.
Different in the sense of like i'm not.
Like the type of girlfriend that's like.
We have to like talk every single day.
Move to be together all the time i feel.
Like always hold hands and be like we're.
Not like that we're fine on our own.
We're fine like with ryan here working.
And me back home working or whatever we.
You know we balance that out but.
Definitely yeah ryan.
Is much more logical well love languages.
That that helped us understanding how.
Many is there by five love languages i.
Love languages are very different yes.
Brian is just time and touch and then.
Mine is probably gifts and acts of.
Service and words of affirmation so.
We're literally the opposite yeah yeah.
So i think a first couple years was.
Tough especially with the distance.
Because we were always a little bit like.
Missing each other like do we like each.
Other do we not and so i think once we.
Kind of figured that out and realized.
Okay we're just - people right right i.
Think ryan is your happy even if we just.
Spend time together if we're not doing.
Anything yep.
But i'm the type that's like we do.
Things and you have to like see i think.
That's common in a lot of relationships.
I think a lot of couples can relate to.
But what helped us is talking about what.
We're talking about right now right i.
Think that will help any relationship to.
Know that because i didn't know that.
People i was just like white i don't.
Understand how you don't understand me.
It was a lot of that before whereas i.
Think what i learned from her is like.
People are just different like very.
Different and it helps and it's.
Interesting too because the thing that.
You guys probably don't know about ryan.
Is he has all these plans and he has all.
These ideas but he's not the type to.
Sort of say it and he never says.
Anything unless he's actually going to.
Do it so if i was like let's say maybe.
Year two in i'd be like hey let's go do.
This.
And he'd be like i don't know or i don't.
Know if i can and in my mind i'm like.
Dude just say like maybe you'll try or.
Maybe we will butt in but later on i.
Realized it's because he didn't want to.
Say it and not do it because in his mind.
That's worse whereas i think for me i.
Would be like no i just want to know.
That you're making the effort if that.
Makes sense.
Yeah but yeah i mean and then to answer.
Paco's question with ryan i like that.
He's so logical and he sort of like.
Helps me during your break together yeah.
Yeah i think for me like i take on a lot.
Of things i'm doing a lot of things all.
The time but in like the most simplest.
Way he's really good about being like.
Hey it's okay you have all these things.
You have to do today and then you got.
Five new things to do but everything's.
Gonna be okay.
Let's take it one at a time and so he's.
Really good about like helping me sort.
Of do that and like we play clash.
Together and a lot of times i start.
Freaking out and i'm like oh my gosh.
We're gonna lose we're gonna lose and it.
Just i start putting cards down and then.
You'll be like normal people who don't.
Know it's a game you can play with two.
People he'll be like no we're okay we.
Still got this and then you like calm.
Down and then we win and it's awesome.
Yeah it's just i think another big one.
It's a perfect example i think you being.
Like this.
Hey i think it'll help other people it's.
Helping me but at the same time that's.
What i'm thinking that's why i think.
About you all the time was okay no it's.
Even no anyway i think another good one.
Is like something that i think i never.
Understood how people couldn't get over.
Is if something bad would happen to you.
That day how you would linger on.
Something and i always thought like what.
There's nothing you can do about that it.
Happened like how can you improve it and.
Versus like a lot of times she'll bring.
Me something like something bad will.
Happen to her she'll tell me all about.
It and instead of comforting her which.
My natural thing is i'm gonna solve the.
Problem how do i stop this from.
Happening in the future.
That doesn't work guys and girls out.
There who are illogical that's mostly.
Guys though mostly but it's mostly guys.
Were factors so don't i had to learn the.
Hard way like they just want a lot a lot.
Of people just want compassion and not a.
Solution.
Yeah even though i think the thing is.
And that's actually something that i do.
Appreciate about you too is that he.
Helps me get out of that like lingering.
Faster but i think you have to first.
Approach it with compassion and then fix.
It like for example let's say like i.
Trip a lot when i walk up the stairs but.
Sometimes like i would fall really hard.
And they might be bleeding and then ryan.
Would be like why did you do that okay.
There is definitely times and you're.
Like why would you do well you know i'd.
Be like what were you running because.
I'm sorry thing like maybe you should.
Stop running.
Yes so like for the longest time i was.
Like he's so mean but then later i.
Realize.
In his mind he's logically trying to fix.
Me so that i no longer stop tripping.
Because he's like why do you always trip.
He trips so much i mean i know it's not.
It's because my mind is faster than my.
Climate like my life you know others and.
I'm thinking of other things and my legs.
Just can't keep up i'm just like boy i'm.
A lot realized sorry and a lot who's.
What i'm trying not to laugh he always.
Laughs see that's why he cares about you.
Yeah no no it's fine because i.
Understand where it comes from but also.
I mean i'm just this is like the most.
Like basic example where now though he's.
Really good about being like oh are you.
Okay and then let's not do that anymore.
I don't say okay me but he doesn't say.
Like that but he you know this well.
That's a very specific example that's.
Just one example and i'm obviously this.
Happens in like a lot of other things.
Where like let's say something bad.
Happens at work and i'm my days ruined.
But then he'll you know let me sort of.
Vent through it and he'll be there but.
Then very short after he'll point out.
Things that are still positives and.
Instead of me spending the rest of the.
Day lingering on that and being upset.
I'll kind of be over it because he'll.
Have helped me logically realize that.
Hey there's really nothing i can do to.
Control that moment in situation so.
Let's not be sad forever so in a way it.
Kind of helps that you guys have.
Different perspectives because you.
Really need to each other and you can.
See it in another way and because if not.
I would have never like if that happens.
To other people i would just give the.
Logic like the solution versus like.
Compassion like yeah you wouldn't have.
Compassion robot i just think it's weird.
It's like you're missing this like.
Compassionate dna i'm super feely dude.
But you know ryan's really sweet he's.
Really sweet he's really sweet and.
What's crazy is that they're so sweet.
And he has such a big heart which is one.
Of the things i love about him but he.
Would never really let you know and.
He'll never take credit for it and does.
A lot of things for people you don't.
Know.
Yeah yeah so he's a type that would.
Really.
Ever want anyone to know yeah definitely.
Not one of those like youtubers that.
Would go and like film the nice deed.
Done that before but we've also done.
That though i'm telling it now we've.
Done i mean just growing up it was just.
Like for fun yeah like it's not because.
I care okay alright so i guess are.
Really not so sweet considering.
Everything it's so it's selfish i'm.
Doing it cuz it makes me feel good.
Whether people know or not it's like you.
Know i have extra bucks i'm gonna go to.
Walmart get a blankie or whatever and.
Nothing to do in hilo so we drive around.
And give homeless people blankets and.
Stuff it's not because i'm like hey.
Let's film this it's because i'm bored.
Yeah and it's something to do and it's.
Not a bad thing in my mind and i feel.
Good about it.
So it's selfish yeah but it's different.
The unselfish byproduct a lot of things.
That we do that are everything for me.
Like you know you mentioned earlier that.
I love you know meeting young people and.
Helping people i love connecting people.
But it's because i want to help people.
But at the same time it makes me feel.
Good right yeah people need to.
Understand that everything we do is.
First i have nothing it's it's fine.
Yes anything wrong with that yeah like i.
Give paco romance advice because i want.
To one day when he gets married be like.
Hey yeah cuz of me i know and i'll do my.
Girl or whatever or boy or boy whatever.
Happens girl i support it all yeah yeah.
I love you either way mm-hmm but i want.
To go into something a little bit deeper.
Now.
Brian is so exposed right now he's never.
Been this honestly not that deep maybe.
Not that he just more i want to know.
Because you guys do have a long-distance.
Relationship and we talked a little bit.
Of about dating online and stuff and a.
Lot of times online dating is a lot of.
Long-distance at times so what made you.
Know it worked for you guys like where.
Did you guys compromise it you.
Compromise out clearly you did but you.
Know talk about it like what where in.
Your mind what did you have to give up.
In order to make this work i did.
I guess i'll start i had to change.
I live by habit and i follow the same.
Thing i normally do so you're boring and.
It's mean to some people but people who.
Live like me understand this is what.
Works and this is what i'm gonna stick.
To so i have to disrupt my schedule and.
To me that's a big thing it might not be.
A big deal to other people but if you've.
Done a thing a certain way for a long.
Time and it works for you to change that.
Is is see it sounds bad but it's a big.
Deal to me it was a bishop like you're.
Laughing it's true that's i mean i was.
Dying because i just remember like year.
One there is this time when like i was.
Like we never do anything and you were.
Like we went to the grocery store.
Yesterday and he was really proud of.
That yeah we left the house i would have.
Normally just order things to come to me.
Right ryan didn't leave his house for.
Like eight months guys before we start.
That is not true yeah i do things you do.
More things now i do more things now.
What people hit me out like hey do you.
Think ryan would do this i'm like dude.
If you can get him out of the house.
That's amazing are you talking    to.
People you know what though i've gotten.
Pretty good at getting him out of the.
House yeah well me because he cares.
About you he l words you i came out for.
Your birthday party he did i surprised.
Me for my birthday no oh sorry no.
Because you say go cuz i care about you.
But i went to his birthday party oh and.
You left the house for jenna's birthday.
Party you surprised her in la - that was.
A long time ago.
Mmm i just like being home yeah he does.
He likes being home but yeah i would say.
Compromise is probably the biggest thing.
And i think it works for us because.
We're both really busy with what we're.
Doing and because would she have.
Something going on i think long-distance.
Relationship is really hard when one.
Person is always waiting if that makes.
Sense yeah if there's less that that.
Person because it's hard to if you're.
Just waiting around it's hard to like.
Like oh why aren't you texting me like.
Every morning because you know if you're.
Working you probably don't have the.
Energy sometimes or you don't have the.
Time and i think it's also understanding.
Like there's definitely times when we'll.
Talk a lot more.
Maybe we'll facetime more maybe we'll.
You know hop on the phone a lot more but.
Then there'll be weeks where we won't.
Talk much at all either because his work.
Schedule is crazy or because mine is.
Crazy but we have a mutual understanding.
Knowing that that's okay and i think.
That's something i really appreciate.
About ryan because you know maybe five.
Six years ago there was someone i was.
Dating that when i'd be done filming and.
I might have a 17-hour day on set.
18-hour day on set where i literally am.
Leaving set washing my face and hitting.
The bed so fast that don't even have.
Time to text goodnight and it sounds.
Kind of selfish but just really tired.
And sometimes you don't want to talk but.
Then that person would get really.
Irritated and upset not understand and.
Not understand filming schedule or long.
Hours but ryan gets that and so i think.
You know whenever something is busy like.
That i don't have to worry that oh no.
He's gonna be upset like because he's.
Not he gets it you know and if we make.
Plans and it changes he's like alright.
That's cool i get it and i'm for sure.
Filming in general i think it's it's.
Really tough for the other person who's.
Not in that industry if you're not in.
The entertainment industry to date.
Somebody that is i think is it takes a.
Long time to get used to it i mean just.
The fact that like in me i had to even.
Get used to you just kissing another guy.
On a show even though it's acting you.
Know oh my hey you kissed somebody else.
Too.
No i'm not saying i'm just yeah but i'm.
Just saying you have to get used to it.
You have to understand like if you're.
Very open about it like that's there's.
There's other obstacles that most.
Couples don't have to go through right.
Right and that is a big one and i'm sure.
Like it's not we're not the only ones.
That i mean if you had it's true you.
Know but i will say for those of you.
Guys out there if you run into that.
Situation i think kissing on camera is.
Really the most unintuitive ever felt.
Intimacy kissing on camera which is.
Really kind of sad to say when people.
Are like wow you guys have so much.
Chemistry i'm always like well thank god.
We're good actors i literally i think.
I've always felt nothing and so and i.
Think it's because you have 150 people.
Staring at you you've got cameras in.
Your face you got what people think.
Right and then it's always funny when.
You see the most romantic shots and it's.
Beautiful those are the ones that are.
The most awkward because it's everything.
Slow and they're like move your hand.
Higher or lower turn your cheek turn.
Your face this way that way and it's so.
Awkward but then you know with sound and.
Editing in lights they make it look good.
And so one of the least romantic things.
And we i mean you know more than anyone.
It's kissing in the rain oh yeah we've.
Done a small version of that oh a lot in.
Teen wolf yeah because people think it's.
So romantic is in the notebook oh yeah i.
Would assume it is we had this scene.
Where just so you guys know when you.
Film with rain it's not like normal rain.
It's like pouring pouring water because.
For it to catch on camera oh maureen you.
Can't see you can't see it so if you.
Guys ever see like raining outside you.
Just try to film it you really can't see.
Anything so then to replicate rain for.
Fit for camera and for film they just.
Just go crazy and i remember when we.
Would do these things running through.
Rain by the time we even get to each.
Other we just can't see and then we're.
Kissing and then holding it for however.
Long till they call cut i remember after.
Every take we would just release and.
Both be spitting water on the ground and.
It was just like it was a gross but it.
Looks romantic and awesome yeah that's.
For was that teen wolf.
Yeah teen wolf we did that we kissed in.
The rain a lot i feel like yeah there's.
A lot of rain rain that show is very.
Much like it's more of a romance than.
It's like yeah i would say it's like a.
Lot of romance a lot of action it's.
Really fun it's very dark but yeah.
There's definitely a lot of romance and.
They make it look good we had some.
Really great a great crew the great dp.
Made it look really nice that was um i.
Sent the video i said it wasn't my.
Favorite show.
Oh really they're like oh ryan just.
Didn't like it because it like me.
Kissing another guy well but we weren't.
Even dating like that no no that wasn't.
The research oh that's not no i think.
The show you're on now is great yeah.
It's like well it's well-written not.
That teen wolf wasn't guys okay but i.
Just i think it's not meant for me.
I think that's meant for more.
I mean i don't know if it is but i.
Thought it was meant for more for girls.
Or guys constantly have these beautiful.
Body shots and body shots yeah we have a.
Lot of guy fans too and a lot of.
Middle-aged women there's a lot of moms.
Really the only people that like run.
After me like at the grove in la are.
Like forties fifties women really yeah.
Well that is uh i did not know that was.
I thought it was like 13 to 17 year old.
Female girls yeah i think they more.
Excited for the boys yeah they're.
They're more excited for like dylan.
O'brien tyler and like cody you know.
Those guys yeah well i didn't realize.
How long we're going but we should go.
Into some questions actually some of.
Those questions were so the biggest.
Similarity was from cm see my janice on.
Twitter yeah the question about long.
Distance relationships from andrew tran.
On reddit which one's did we do a little.
Bit compromise know what do you think is.
The number one advice and what would you.
Say to make it work long-distance.
Relationships it's hard to say because.
Ours is such a weird thing you know so.
Different from other people but i think.
That's something important that every.
Relationship needs to understand is that.
Your relationship wow a relationship is.
Unique in its own way and you need to be.
Able to compromise and not be selfish.
Something that works for you won't.
Necessarily work for me or are you yes.
Became a weekly yeah i mean yeah i know.
It makes sense yeah but also well not.
Soft was super soft guys don't listen to.
Him i don't know what that was like.
People i just gotta keep my brand oh.
That's all you know is that your brand i.
Don't know why is your brand like that.
What made you think that that was his.
Defense mechanism mm-hmm i feel like.
That's what allows he's so emotional it.
Doesn't matter who very emotional it's.
Are they're more twitter questions.
Twitter questions there were more but i.
Mean we don't have to state we don't.
Have to do it i just i think we need.
Still hear what's good what you got i.
Guess you know uh vanessa mendes asks.
Arden what are some actors you would.
Like to work with mm oh you know i want.
To work with these days gemma chan.
Super big fan she's crazy yeah like to.
Work with her she's covered a lot lately.
Tough she's been doing like what it why.
Her specific just cuz she's pretty not.
Just cuz she's pretty someone clip that.
And send it to her so that arden and her.
Can collab in some way oh my gosh no i.
Just think i don't know i just really.
Like her yeah she's just a very.
Sophisticated nice elegance to her even.
In her style of acting i think it's.
Really right really really great i mean.
Because i really like like natalie.
Portman i like nicole kidman i like your.
Like classic beauties mm-hmm and i think.
It's really exciting to feel like now.
There's an asian american woman that i'm.
Like yes that's like that mm-hmm.
Okay yeah another twitter question from.
Yellow paco so do you but really are you.
Serious did you guys kiss yet we're.
Waiting till marriage.
Yeah we're not inappropriate so you guys.
Have kissed other people but not each.
Other yeah but it's just acting can you.
Guys at right now and kiss each other oh.
That's so awesome.
Hmm i mean it's so if you're reading out.
Yourself then i guess that's it huh yeah.
That's not it okay you should tell.
People how really bad you are with.
Trends oh yeah you're like oh my gosh.
I'll be like wow babe have you seen this.
And he's like um that was a trend like.
Two and a half years ago hey why do you.
Always when you do my voice like um well.
I text i see it like that no i don't i.
Don't put enough emojis that's oh that's.
A good tip for those of you who are.
Dating especially you guys out there an.
Emoji will go a long way yeah a little.
Smiley face would turn okay - okay just.
Add the colon and parentheses and it.
Changes everything.
Are you mad no exclamation point happy.
Face everything it's like are you mad.
And it just no they are it's because.
Before that if.
Or that if you are you mad will happen.
If you don't put the emoji we have the.
Emojis shows everything's fine i don't.
Know if that's just us but i think a lot.
If you date a guy that you think is.
Always mad don't ask him if he's mad.
Because he's probably never mad i.
Learned that too later the hard way i'm.
Not always appearing mad is that you're.
More see when you're smiling and you're.
Happy it's great but it's a lousy social.
You're so serious like too bad yeah good.
Luck good luck editing this yeah for a.
Part - you guys would like to see art.
