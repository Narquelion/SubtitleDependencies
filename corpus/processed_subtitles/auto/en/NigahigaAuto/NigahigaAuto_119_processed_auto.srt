Thing a human being can do so let's get.
Started the first lesson in being pc is.
To avoid the trendy topic if an issue is.
Trending on social media or talked about.
On the news chances are you should.
Probably avoid that topic because all of.
A sudden everybody really cares about it.
Now and no matter which side you pick.
Her probably gonna offend someone here's.
An example of a trendy controversial.
Topic net you guys buy remember can you.
Believe this what this is starbucks.
Christmas cup so so there's no christmas.
On the cop this is a blatant attack on.
My religion a blatant attack on.
Christianity plus the cup is red that's.
The same color as hell and the devil and.
Fire and pimples that are not ready to.
Be popped yet well i think they're right.
For not putting christmas on the clubs.
Did you just say well i'm not a.
Christian and if they did have christmas.
Designs on the cup then that's.
Infringing on my first amendment right.
Of freedom of religion how dare you see.
Something just a cup see it might seem.
Like a silly petty argument but since it.
Was trending in the news it's really.
Important now if you really want to be.
Pc avoid the trendy topics this is what.
He should have said guys it's just uh.
Never mind.
No comment.
You know what you're worse than both of.
Us by keeping quiet you're not doing.
Anything so the next lesson in being pc.
Is no more jokes jokes are a thing of.
The past i mean you might think that.
Some jokes are not that bad but in 2017.
All jokes are offensive hey you want to.
Hear this joke i just read okay all.
Right so three guys walk into the bar oh.
Three guys huh do you know you guys were.
Against women's rights what why do they.
Have to be guys they don't well then.
It's sexist why are there no women women.
Go to bars too yeah i know dude it's.
Just a joke oh it's just a joke what.
Women aren't funny enough to be a part.
Of your little joke it fine it doesn't.
Really matter okay.
Three women good walk into the bar in.
The middle of the day right the middle.
Of the day wow what is it now oh you're.
Saying all women are alcoholics you a.
Bunch of misogynist hey why did the duck.
Cross the road why to prove you wasn't.
Chicken are you implying that all.
Chickens are cowards or that somehow.
Ducks are above chickens in some way why.
Because ducks and chickens are equal.
Okay and people like you were support.
Ducks supremacy are part of the problem.
What are you talking about i don't see.
How this is offensive yeah of course you.
Don't you don't see it because you're a.
Little privileged duck boy i grew up in.
The safety of your little ranch so of.
Course you're not afraid chickens.
Chickens we grew up in fear we get drugs.
Gmos forced him to us at the mills were.
Forced to watch each other get.
Slaughtered just for food it ducks get.
Eaten - yeah they do but tell me how.
Often do you come across duck eggs at.
The supermarket huh how often do you.
Pass by a fast-food chain called kfd you.
See all bird lives do matter but right.
Now.
Chicken lives those are the lives that.
Are in danger and that's what's trending.
What do you call someone with no cell.
Phone i don't know what a houseful.
Because with no cell phone you got a.
Closet with a household as somebody who.
Finds jonah hill on my casseras comedy.
Inappropriate i take offense to that.
Joke what they've never even said this.
Joke how is this even related to either.
Of them because it was super bad and.
Finally the last lesson in being pc is.
For you to know that everything is.
Offensive if you don't think that.
Something is offensive chances are.
You're a bad person and you're not.
Looking hard enough here let me make it.
Easy for you i'll give you some examples.
Now take a look at this x-men poster.
Does it offend you at all because if it.
Doesn't you hate women it's clearly.
Showing a man choking a woman's that.
Means you think that it's okay for men.
To choke women not to mention at the top.
Of the billboard it says only the strong.
Survive implying that men are stronger.
Than women but that's not it this poster.
Isn't just sexist it's racist i mean why.
Is the light-skinned blue person talking.
The dark-skinned blue person and not the.
Other way around take a look at the date.
On the bottom don't tell me it's just a.
Coincidence that they conspired the.
Release date to be on may 27th the exact.
Same day the race riots in east saint.
Louis took place in 1917 and the title.
Itself is not just sexist it's a hate.
Crime i mean the title of the franchise.
Is x men y not x women i'll tell you why.
Because x-men apocalypse is an attack on.
The lgbt community that's right x-men.
Stands for transgender their x-men they.
Used to be men other women so they're.
X-men so when they say x-men apocalypse.
What they're really trying to say is.
That this is the end of the world for.
The transgender community i will not.
Stand for that i will remain sitting i.
Will not this is old news it's not.
Trending anymore it's no big deal then.
Next so in closing i know there's a lot.
Of things to remember so i'm gonna.
Simplify it and try and wrap everything.
Up in order to be a truly politically.
Correct person avoid all the trendy.
Controversial topics which basically.
Means that if something is being talked.
About by somebody somewhere about.
Something you may not have an opinion.
About it because you're wrong and it's.
Gonna offend someone must also remember.
No more jokes jokes are a thing of the.
Past.
So remember to never laugh or make.
Anyone else laugh because if you do that.
Means you're laughing at the issue.
Issues like war and rape and racism so.
If you laugh you're a racist war rapists.
And last but not least and most.
Importantly everything is offensive it's.
Not rocket science if you don't want to.
Offend others it's simple don't have.
Opinions don't take any action.
Don't walk talk move where or share.
Anything you're thinking about.
Especially if it's about an issue and.
Everything is an issue and at the same.
Time keep in mind there with all these.
Issues if you don't speak up and take.
Action you guys are part of the problem.
So stop having opinions stop taking.
Action and step up and do something and.
Take.
Hey cut cut what no no it's not you the.
Video is great message is clear just.
We're missing something i don't think.
We're gonna get the views this way.
Unless hi i'm ryan higa and i'm.
