William no one else when you get in.
Trouble yes exactly yeah but so your.
Housemates i mean obviously you live.
With a bunch of other gamers we should.
Introduce you first for people who don't.
Know scara is originally you started.
Doing playing league right you were like.
Professional esports i was as a.
Professional league of legends player.
For two or three years then i.
Transitioned to being a coach for six.
Months and then afterwards i would and.
In between i was i've been a streamer.
For about seven to nine years wow.
I'd have to really double check because.
I didn't start streaming on twitch i.
Started amy on xfire and exactly you it.
Was like it's such a stuffed program you.
Had a cap of 50 people so like if you.
Hit your cap people have to wait in a.
Queue so people at someone left to watch.
The stream and so i used to stream water.
Warcraft arena on xfire to kappa 50.
People like way back when and then you.
Always filled out your cap.
Yeah yeah i was actually really good and.
The funniest thing is like i was i was.
Like one of the top rate players on my.
Battlegroup i could never get ranked one.
And the reason i could never get ranked.
One.
It's cuz hospice team was so good she's.
Just like actually just beat the.
Out of my team until we got like the.
Moralize we hate her quit the game i was.
Like i see was like her team is way too.
Good like oh he had like yeah she was a.
Really good druid she had a really great.
Warrior she had a really great warlock.
And they had like literally like some of.
The best players in our battle group on.
The team it'll she's actually building.
An impostor and and the funny thing is.
Now you're doing your streaming tft yes.
Which is team fight tactics yes it is i.
Don't know it's like a game bride game.
Just kinda yeah yeah it's a strategy.
Game right okay.
Actually the best i found the best way.
To describe it it's a deck building game.
It's a building it's a strategical deck.
Building game with i guess gambling.
Elements it's got to be one of the more.
I mean i don't know if it's i haven't.
Checked recently but is it more popular.
Than fortnight yet on twitch hell no for.
Days but it still it's one of the bigger.
Ones right i will the tribute it to.
Something like it's like hearthstone you.
Know okay and so it's something that.
Like there was a lot of crazy around.
There before and unless it's probably.
It's died down by now and unless they do.
Something big like it's probably this.
Day like at a good level for like a.
Couple years right and that's so.
Interesting you put all this time into.
Learning this like skill and this art.
And it could you you have to adjust.
Right like you can't just play the same.
Game well league i guess i play league.
For like 7 years actually so i never.
Thought i'd switch and then just.
Randomly like i went in to play this.
Game okay i actually got was getting.
Tired of league for the first time in.
Seven years wow.
So i started playing dota auto chess i'm.
Like i'm in my stream i actually had.
These where i played more all the chests.
That played league of legends and this.
Is the five months following tfts launch.
And then one day i got a invite from rai.
Games super 8 dat like we need we want.
You to come in and test our game i'm.
Just like okay mm-hmm they even say it.
Was a game you like we need you to test.
Something confidential but through mike.
Did a great provide that new was a game.
So much i woulda died and they were.
Making their own daugther auto chest.
Which is the the first iteration of the.
Genre uh-huh and it turns out that like.
As i was trying to escape ride games.
Like the clutches of riot games to play.
Other different games they just dragged.
Me back in so then i became like one of.
The faces 40ft.
And like a lot of my success is.
Attributed to me jumping on the.
Bandwagon first right right so they were.
Very supportive of your career then you.
Say or i mean yeah right like i was a i.
Was a streamer for illegal edges that.
Became a top seaman for the new game.
Like i was actually like i okay i was i.
Was almost a consultant for them at some.
Point i felt because it's like when we.
We they have like a chat room with all.
The the alpha testers and we talk a lot.
About the game but even then like i at.
Some point had to figure out if the game.
Was worth like all any on and what ended.
Up happening was when they first invited.
Me to that meeting and like everyone.
Else else ended up leaving i sat down.
With the devs for like two hours after.
Hours like we're literally eating in the.
Dinner room i sat down for two hours and.
Talked to them not just about the game.
Like the future they gave my talk to.
What's your distribution plan like.
What's your like how are you guys gonna.
Make money what's the future of your.
Game what's expansion look like wow.
Everything i heard about from talking.
With them i was like these guys that are.
Intelligent they know what they want to.
Do they can enact change quickly and.
Like i really like these guys and so i.
All end on the premise that i like the.
People working on it more than the.
Premise of i like the company or like.
Anything about the game get interesting.
Because the first the first iteration of.
The game we got was like yeah potential.
But it's like man honestly it was it.
Wasn't as good and even now i should.
Credit you yeah you pretty much helped.
Develop it like i do anything about the.
Game i was just saying the like i i.
Talked him about some but like a lot of.
Stuff i talked to him about they already.
Need to do so like it's not like i was.
There to be like oh you know i made any.
Part of the game successful i'm just.
Saying they're like i thought them a.
Little bit about stuff here and there in.
A way it's almost like you guys both.
Affirmed like this is what we because it.
Does really yeah you confirmed yeah yeah.
But we're talking about a lot about you.
Know what you're currently doing yeah.
Let's go into your past a little bit.
Because it's actually it's it's a niche.
You have interesting stories you do a.
Really ok i hate my hit me with my just.
References they you guys know each other.
From yeah we've known each other for a.
While now because that's sighs i mean.
Clearly you know something i don't know.
We don't know her like me and david's so.
Yes i i've met paco.
Four years ago four years ago i saw i.
Started offline tv which is like a group.
Of how do i even see like a gamer yeah.
This is actually a gamer house but like.
Streamers house and we didn't fail it's.
Like there's so many like there's been.
Like a lot of streamers yes yeah that.
Been growing up and that like we were.
The ones that are able to kind of.
Succeed in a formula i have no idea how.
Like essentially i brought together a.
Lot of people that wanted it's so funny.
Actually at the origin story was like i.
Had a version me and like no manager.
Chris and i had an excel document i was.
Like in this dock me i'd the people i.
Wanted to work with like in the house.
And so like like pokies name was on.
There which it we eventually got her.
Toast is on there but i was like oh.
Toast wasn't even on there it was so.
Early i didn't lilly picchu one of the.
People who live live was a lives with us.
Is on there and i was like there's.
Nobody can get her she's too big so i.
Like crossed her out and like we didn't.
Even try to get her like the first the.
First couple people we got but like we.
End up grabbing a lot of content.
Creators it's been i think about two and.
A half years since we started all of us.
Are doing pretty well like it's been.
Pretty successful and where was i going.
With this.
There's oh yeah i met him because pocket.
Tiger came over a long time ago and i.
Think me before that actual house yeah.
Was even like created it was one you.
Know the base unit that's why it was.
Grabbing food a couple of oh yeah so so.
I use are i still have a friend sorry.
They used to name orlando and then i met.
Him through orlando and then what's so.
Funny when we're starting off off off.
Off line we were just like how do we.
Make cool stuff and then he drove over.
To try to help us do school stuff we.
Still have he was one of the first.
People to film our very first skit ever.
Wow and that was the reason why we don't.
Do skits anymore because we're just.
Awful actors actually like the worst.
Footage i really want to see i don't.
Even know how to find it like i'm pretty.
Sure it's hidden somewhere like we our.
First ever skin was done with pakhi oh.
That's when we learned that streamers.
Are not actors or actresses and that we.
Probably do a little bit better with.
Improv and like set scenarios than just.
Like hey let's read off lines oh    we.
Can't read off lines well i mean it's.
Kind of a we do i mean we have lines but.
We'll improv it yeah a lot of times you.
Can tell you that huh i said see what.
Makes you feel comfortable.
Yeah yeah okay so basically you guys met.
But before that story in it because like.
You have to tell me the story from that.
Point because i am not even sure i.
Remember the first time i met you it was.
At korean barbecue okay but we kind of.
Just talked about because i was very.
Curious to like your backstory and how.
You kind of got into league how you.
Became a team with dignitas all that.
Stuff okay guys are like you oh boy like.
You you want my life story from what i.
Got was just interesting because it was.
A gamble you know in a way alright so i.
Was playing league of legends like like.
The first season started league of.
Legends was it had no support right i.
Came from a game called heroes of.
Newerth.
I i switched to league of legends.
Because all my friends quit and my.
Brother was like hey you got come play.
With me and my friends like dota i.
Picked up cuz he wasn't playing it his.
Friends league.
What were your professional at that time.
Or you were just an amateur i wasn't.
Anything right i think the best that.
Place was i was top 100 on the hawn.
Ladder.
He wasn't the earth ladder but some that.
Like i was not a professional player or.
Anything i did well in world warcraft.
But like i didn't consider myself.
Professional right and so i just jumped.
To league of legends and the i remember.
First three games at played i had.
Averaged 30 kills a game and i was like.
This game is so easy like i can't new.
This is a children's game this game is.
Dumb i hated the game when i first.
Started and then like onwards and.
Onwards onwards and i ended up getting.
Into it and i went to the very top i.
Remember i got no this because i was.
Ranked 3 in the month it took me to.
Level 230 rank came out and when rank.
Came out i hit rank 3 third in the 30.
North america oh playing exhausting.
Night catarina and everyone was just.
Like who is this guy because all the top.
Players are from beta and so no one knew.
Who i was.
Except for one person who would become.
My future teammate locust.
Locus knew me because he said play world.
Of warcraft on my server and he.
Remembered that i was a top pvp on that.
Server and i made the kinect that way.
And then we started a team together so.
It's like you know that six degrees of.
Separation it's like in esports it's.
Actually like i know one person they.
Know everyone else then that's how it.
Was this seven years ago crazy it's not.
Even that long it is but if you think.
About it how much things have changed.
Like you said you guys just formed a.
Team and then look where you are like.
Seven years isn't that long for how far.
In esports i think six months is a long.
Time he used to be so crazy that in the.
First two seasons people people were.
Like what's your long-term plan now it's.
Like that's a joke right so so in in.
Normal businesses from what i understand.
Dr. pan plans like a ten year plan you.
Know short-term is one year long term is.
Ten years and then that's it.
In esports long year long term is one.
Year and short term is one week and so i.
Couldn't tell you at any given moment in.
Like like at some periods during the.
Last five years a lot of periods well.
That was doing the week after mm-hmm and.
I even even now like two months ago if.
You had asked me are you gonna quit.
Legal and she's like hell no - i love.
Legal legends and then eft comes out you.
Know i blow up plain tft and now i'm.
Like an entire i'm like a strategy gamer.
Now and it's just it's really strange.
Because i that's no we're way i expected.
To go and like mice like my success i'm.
Trying really hard not to take it for.
Granted.
Trying to work really hard on it but.
Like it just came out of nowhere i like.
To think that like especially in esports.
A lot of opportunities will come up.
Randomly and it's just like your hard.
Work will dictate your your luck if i.
Need these and then then it's just up to.
You to pursue them like then it's up to.
Your hard work to maintain like the.
Success you know do you think any person.
Just like any any single person could.
Train and play as much as you play a.
Certain game and become as good as you.
Are or do you think some people just.
Think differently and help as good as me.
Are you wear dresses i think i person.
Think there's a there's like this it's i.
Always wondered cuz i know like half.
Would she didn't play that game at all.
And like all of a sudden.
Hold at the top at these well especially.
It comes to ha fou i think there's a.
Skill sets of people excel it so like if.
You're an fps gamer yeah really good.
Reaction time right uh uh really good.
Like i guess like muscle movement you.
Know when it comes to that kind of stuff.
Fps skills will translate in between fps.
Games right so ashley if you want the.
Best skill set you should be an fps.
Gamer because there's always there's.
Always a need for that skill set.
Strategy gamers are like you know maybe.
They they don't think quickly but they.
Think like well like overall um they are.
Maybe slow mechanically they don't have.
Much mechanics but they're very good at.
Being able to understand and piece.
Together different pieces to make like a.
Whole picture right uh and so those are.
Skill sets about that way a lot of.
Strategy gamers have people like this.
Guys toast ha food dog very very like.
Very good at excelling like and knowing.
Like the value of things and like the.
Odds of stuff happening you know and so.
Everyone just has different skill sets.
When you grow up you learn to learn.
These skill sets from a lotta different.
Things you know and it doesn't have to.
Be games like let's say you were i don't.
Know like you're playing you're a.
Badminton player and you have really.
Good like hand-eye coordination because.
You play a lot of tennis you play a lot.
Of batmanning you need that high.
Hand-eye coordination to play that skill.
To play that a high level and then you.
Can translate some of that's going to.
Play in fps.
Right and so a lot of people who are.
Really really talented just play games.
All their lives ok well that's.
Interesting to me i've always wondered.
That and well i mean like if i were to.
Ask you like you said it's a certain.
Skill so do you think if you were to.
Just just start playing a lot and just.
Trained your ass off you could become a.
First person shooter player um i always.
Tell people is that yes that i could.
Become good but do you think you become.
Like where you are i could not be.
Legendary at the game oh but i.
But like because the amount of hours.
That have to put in especially at this.
Point in my life is very it's like i.
Don't have enough timing right but if i.
Did i'd have to literally switch.
Everything into doing that so i guess at.
Some level you have to have confidence.
In your ability to succeed right so for.
Me i always think if i put enough hours.
Into something i'll be good at it mhm.
And that's just the confidence i have in.
Myself right but i don't ever think i.
Will be like a super good at something.
So like i might put in thousand hours.
Playing overwatch like more than that.
Let's let's say i put a whole year to.
Play over.
In playing call of duty and playing apex.
And csgo how good would i be at fps.
Games well if i actually trained and.
Practiced i did a lot of like ain't.
Ballestas stuff in queue has an actual.
Regimented schedule i'd probably make.
Like global we'd actually i believe that.
But right now if you look at my school.
You've laugh at me if i said that like.
Actually like if i play fps games you.
Look at my skill you buckle this guy's.
Never played held a gun before ever i.
Just this guy in real life more than.
Like online it's really bad.
Like i think i'd probably be able to hit.
Like that you enjoy it though like if.
You're not i mean my little enjoye being.
Bad at something but i enjoy improving.
At something so like if i if there was a.
Game that really like caught my.
Interests legalize just comes out with.
An fps game and i'm just i just want to.
Be    good like i it kills me to be.
Bad at the game i would put in the hours.
Oh there's not something yet i'm like i.
Want to do that and for me i i just see.
Better use of my time like for instance.
Like people a lot a lot of people see.
You with idea i'm a normal day and i.
Just tell them all i do is i eat sleep.
Tf2 you mm-hmm and read that sounds like.
A merch idea but like for the first.
Three weeks of tft launch which it's.
Been about a month enough in month in.
Three weeks in i would plate tft for 12.
Hours.
Wow i'll wake up shower tft for 12 hours.
Maybe go to the gym.
I've personal trainer for like three.
This week whatever maybe go there and.
Come back after tft goes out for three.
Hours i would need a record a video.
About tft now take an hour about two.
Hours so like literally i like 3 a.m. or.
00 a.m. i'm recording a video in.
The middle of the night to put on.
Youtube to like fight to right answer.
The occasional guys because obviously if.
I'm blowing up on tnt.
I'm i capitalize on the success smart um.
Or i would walk into toast room and i.
Would talk to him about the day i'm.
Talking be like hey you know like what.
Do you think it's good what you think.
It's bad i would if he's not available.
Even if i'm eating i'm bringing up tft.
Streams i'm watching dog i'm watching.
Hoff watching like hyped i'm watching.
Say i'm watching all these really good.
Players i would absorb information even.
If i'm not playing so like i would say.
The first like three weeks i was putting.
In like 16-hour days there sounds like.
You enjoy it oh yeah i really enjoy and.
Right now like i would say my motivation.
For the game is lower than when it would.
Start.
For sure i'm streaming like only like.
Six hours why is that um too easy.
No i'm actually struggling a lot right i.
Think i'm trying to take it easy because.
Um let's talk about that actually oh.
Yeah currently i'm doing a challenge i.
Started the year i wanted to do ustream.
For every single day this year and so.
365 days of streaming and when i first.
Started challenge it's because i saw.
Coke carnage pretty people don't know.
Coke are huge variety stream like really.
Really big rice jimmer he's been.
Streaming on twitch like since forever.
He is really dedicated audience he.
Averages like you know seven eight.
Thousand play anything like jrpgs.
Doesn't matter he has the world record.
For longest time consecutively streaming.
On twitch can you guess what it is 164.
Days i don't know i don't know i mean if.
He's 32 days it's six years what no it's.
Five and a half years its way every.
Single day it's 2,000 days so like you.
That's like what uh okay he he streamed.
Through his first child and he stopped.
In a second and he made a video about it.
And that was his schedule he was.
Consistently streaming every single day.
That's how he got blew up bigger that's.
How he blew up he he was more amazing.
Though he was more consistent than early.
Morning talk shows he was there every.
Day of the week more consistent in your.
Family members he was there for you you.
Like kind of stuff and i saw that.
Challenge i was like i'm gonna try doing.
That let's start easy let's start at 365.
So i go through it.
Honestly    joke like the first.
Hundred fifty days i was like this isn't.
Even that challenge i just do this.
Normally you know and then recently like.
With tft popping off i realized that.
It's really when you get new viewers you.
Have to be really careful especially it.
Comes to strategy games because there's.
A lot of back seating and ones that we.
Actually taxi it would be like oh you.
Could alright yeah yeah i see that.
And so yeah when it happens in tft i.
Have a lot of new viewers coming in.
They're just like super toxic super.
Aggressive and like i can't get like a.
Good flow going for my game for my.
Gameplay because like i'm trying to be.
Entertaining i'm trying to be uplifting.
And i'll lose a game.
And maybe it you know honestly like the.
Best players will play sait sometimes.
Literally the best players i watch.
Because it just happens but uh if i ever.
Do that or i have a bad day where i just.
Don't play very well like it becomes.
Super toxic to the point where like i.
Can't play because that on top like i.
Become like super snappy like i on.
Average ban ten people a day right now.
And before when i was out when i was a.
Virgin like 2.5 viewers i was i never.
Abandoned person i been one every two.
Days right it's like just the sudden the.
Influx of the popularity plus the type.
Of game i play it's really back to see.
The book because even you play to the.
Right odds if everything's results based.
Like right so like they see that like oh.
You could've gone for that and they see.
This oh you could have done this but.
It's like even if i made the right play.
I could like it could work out that for.
Me like oh you should have done this why.
Didn't you do that right and so it's.
Really straining i think the last couple.
Days for me doing this challenge not.
Having a rest day as well as doing this.
I've been streaming a lot less hours.
I've been trying to take more time off.
Still doing like what six hours a day.
But like i went from streaming 240 hours.
A month every month that's select that's.
Crazy like a hundred and eighty but what.
Is doing that is you feel the burn out.
Like did you feel like you had to at.
Some point then i think maybe i was a.
Little more snappish at people like.
Because the thing about the most.
Important train has a stream where's.
Patience hmm i would say like cuz this.
Is seeing patients because you didn't.
Get a lot of dumb ask questions like.
People coming it's like like new players.
It's not a book oh you all answer to say.
50 questions 50 times a day.
So it's like you have to pay the other.
Have the patience of a saint or a.
Teacher to be able to do what i do.
Especially if you're like i market.
Myself or and i'm marking myself like.
Maybe brant i don't even like saying.
That word it feels too like artificial.
Like i'm i'm being like you just lots of.
Friendly it's just more yeah yeah i so i.
A lot of people see me i was like it the.
Educational guy like the teacher to.
Professor whatever and like when they.
Come to my starting how do i do this how.
Do i do this how do i do that but like a.
Lot of times i'm just like yo like that.
Way you ask me right there like you.
Could google that like that's just.
Really easy question it's like it's like.
You can know but you're asking me.
Instead and you want me to.
You the answer you already know it.
Sometimes when like that combined with.
People were being dicks yeah because i.
Have a lot of new people like i think.
Before cuz i was i was averaging like.
What 2.5 thousand three thousand viewers.
Which is like you know that's a success.
Story anyway that's a lot but i go from.
That to going to doing like thirteen.
Thousand nine to thirteen thousand.
Literally i quadrupled quintupled my.
Viewership the success comes with some.
Growing pains oh sure.
And i didn't see the problems with my.
Stream challenge and like the other.
Stuff before but after now i'm just like.
Oh    like i have to be really really.
Careful because like i'll get like like.
Really annoyed a lot quicker like all.
This the mental fatigue tends to build.
Up and so for me as a defense mechanism.
I'm like i try out the back d backlash.
Or like travel yes be upset or snap back.
At my viewers as much i ban a lot more.
People every day but that's just the.
Nature of the game i guess and then i i.
Take i'm streaming a little bit less you.
Know i i started reading fantasy fiction.
To try like balance out my might be my.
Thing but like if you have to like if.
You saw my pie chart of what i do for a.
Day it's still like tft what should we.
Call it.
Like streaming youtube videos like.
Sponsorships and then like now you just.
Add in reading right except for reading.
It's like instead of it's like it used.
To be i read like in about an hour to a.
Day on normal i just like reading mm-hmm.
And now i read like four hours a day i.
30 cuz i i.
Turned out my stream i got in my bed so.
30 and it at 430 a.m. wow.
And i woke up i read some more and i'll.
Say huh that's nice it's really nice how.
Many hours of sleep do you generally get.
Oh it's generally it's like 6 to 8 hours.
Probably probably more along the 6 or 7.
Honestly i i think i used to be like i.
Used to be a cutie slip 14 you know 14.
Straight are you serious yeah i don't.
Think i tried really i mean maybe i.
Didn't sleep for like 24 hours i might.
Really i feel like as a kiss so easy.
Asleep a long time like you like yeah i.
Thought like 10 was like a long yeah 10.
To 12 is long 14 that's fine but like.
That's a one thing i have seen about.
Getting older is you tend to sleep a.
Little bit less yeah true but that.
That's like oh the worst thing is i'm.
The oldest person my friend group or.
Likes to anyone i mean almost oh yeah.
I'm definitely always in the house huh.
I'm turning 30 this year okay and it.
Scares me on the big three the big 3-0.
I'm just like    guys everyone.
Everyone looks really young to me i'm.
Like god you're like a baby that.
Wearing diapers around the house it's.
Just a number man no no no i know it's a.
Big deal yeah i like see around people.
I'm just like oh you just got the esport.
You're a professional player that's nice.
To meet you oh you're 16 mm you're half.
My age you could have yackey you could.
Have been their dad yeah you know it's.
Just it's just it's really interesting.
Age wise i think on average like.
Everyone's getting older in the scene.
But you stop people coming in they're.
Really really young you're just like oh.
My god yeah you know we can't go praja.
Age 17 what was i at 17 you know doing.
Stupid    well-well be right back but.
We're gonna take a quick she break and.
Yeah what continue talking about this.
With some twitter questions.
Music.
And we're back okay do i go right into.
Twitter questions or should we welcome i.
Actually had a question i'm answering.
The in the gaming world and this just.
Recently became a thing and i'm sure you.
Have thoughts on this ninja joining.
Mixer mixers microsoft's new streaming.
Platform competing directly with twitch.
For those listeners who don't know okay.
So i told them in the break i was like.
I've already talked a lot like ii this.
Is pretty much like this car a podcast.
At this point so if you guys want.
Talking like please oh no this is the.
Point that's why we get to bring in.
Different people because it's a whole.
World we don't what david and i don't.
Know.
Okay so it's actually very interesting.
To us okay it's super interesting so.
Back to scara podcast let me talk to you.
About my feelings about ninja is.
Actually like okay so ninja moved him to.
Mixer and obviously he's not gonna say.
It's for the money but it's for the.
Money of course whether he said those he.
Wanted to go back to his roots.
But matter what its roots work was.
Twitch that's what yeah his roots was.
Actually halo so he's moving about for.
Money but also cuz like microsoft backs.
What should we call it.
Mixer mhm and then what ends up.
Happening is i think keys would be able.
To get like early access to halo and.
That's gonna be like a big pull for both.
Himself and tharixer for him as a.
Streamer.
He was the superstar streamer and well.
You have to know about twitch and i.
Don't think anyone ever really talks.
About this no streamer ever stays on top.
So the number one streaming on twitch.
Never stays for more than a year every.
Single year like clockwork it moves out.
Actually the longest first place.
Streaming on twitch was cutie pie i.
Think it at one and a half years really.
And then like after him it's like and he.
Was a league of legends dreamer also.
Your former team yeah yes so wait is it.
Happening is like he was the first and.
Then it went to.
Music.
I've been like dr. disrespect and then.
Like ninja and then shroud and then tea.
Foo people who's number one thief is.
Number one right now oh i didn't know.
That i guess huge he's like he's like.
Ninja but like uh-huh old ninja like but.
Old ninja hit the highest highs of any.
Person that right hit the 900k.
Viewership mark collab with drake has.
His own merchant walmart this guy's like.
Household name good branding end up.
Happening was i would say he kind of.
Fell off no one stays on top right yeah.
Kinda fell off and then you got the.
Superstar offer from mixer i'm assuming.
And why not take it the but it's like.
It's only can only be good for him in my.
Opinion like he moves off they think of.
It what happens worst-case scenario he.
Fails to you it's like a two three-year.
Contract right i'm sure it's a two-year.
Contract he got paid a shitload of money.
For it and then the marketing when he.
Returns can you imagine twitches the man.
Returns yeah and they just a silhouette.
Of him and a poster it    pays on.
Billboard's everywhere it's like so.
You're laying on his strategy yeah.
Exactly like like so like worst-case.
Scenario he got himself a bag of like a.
Huge paycheck he comes back after like.
Troubling times and people welcomed him.
Back busy still them right now the most.
Fall person on twitch.tv wow still and.
And that's like the future right you're.
Predicting that and that's poorly if it.
Does well you know it's all good because.
He's a superstar who who changed a.
Platform he's got that draw he's got.
That power to be able to make like it.
Just elevates his brand so much to say.
He can go anywhere and make people come.
To you or at him right but also say this.
Okay so there's actually recently a.
Couple of drama between twitch in ninja.
Yeah sure time heals everything you know.
So maybe that can happen in the future.
But right now there was an issue with.
His channel about promoting other.
Streamers and how there was russian porn.
Oh yeah okay so so like twitch has been.
Really all right let me preface this by.
Saying imagine you're a ceo of twitch do.
You care about like the they're like.
Random like tea sir there's a bit alive.
Terms of service violations or like kind.
Of gray area bs that's been happening.
Here and there.
For the last year like oh this girl got.
Banned for doing for like doing.
Something dis girl thing in there for.
Throwing her cat you know stuff like.
That and what you as a ceo care about.
Like these small things these small.
Infractions probably not right you're.
You're trying to figure out like okay.
Like how do i how do i work with amazon.
To create like a superior product how do.
We make sure our roi is good like what's.
Are not q3 plan like    like that you.
Know it assume you have somebody else.
Yeah right and so it's probably and even.
In the general sphere it's probably not.
That important honestly it's like the.
Really really super hardcore twitter.
Fans it's like i just    up y'all.
Got these like pos things all this stuff.
Recently like they try to promote the.
Stupid stuff where they use ninjas.
Channel as like a beta test to promote.
Other streamers like if you're offline.
The one of the biggest a what a next.
Which employee tweeted that what are the.
Biggest problems with twitch right now.
Is that if a streamer is online offline.
And you go to a stream you will not and.
You're a fan of him you may not watch.
Another streamer so they're trying to.
Make sure that funnel doesn't just i.
Some people out they want try to make it.
Easy access for you to go it instantly.
To another streamer that they're.
Promoting so obviously they tried to.
Bait a product on ninja that was kind of.
Weird still probably what would have.
Been okay but someone was streaming porn.
On the 49 channel on the under the four.
Night tag and got that got recommended.
Cuz they would recommend the all four.
Night streamers because obviously me.
Just fans or fortnight fans they would.
Recommend their category and so ninja.
Obviously doesn't like his brand.
Promoting porn it's kind of    so.
He like had a twitter video about it hey.
You know this is stupid    oh yeah.
Yeah yeah and then the ceo apologized.
They kind of reverted to his channel all.
This stuff in the end it's like this is.
Only good thing this is only good for a.
Danger like that's i see like ninja.
Walks away clean he is on this new.
Platform and i think success or failure.
Will be based on who switches mm-hmm.
I'm very honest i tell my chat look do.
You that mixer comes at me with like a.
10 million dollars i'm out the door you.
Know yeah i even like 5 million i'm out.
The door see you guys that we did it for.
Has a podcast we were just talking about.
This were like yeah skaar what about 1.
Million 1 million not really well what.
About 2 and i'm just like whoa it's like.
I don't like this job for them right.
Let's work our way down yeah but i think.
It's really interesting and generally.
Almost everyone i talk to it it says.
That mixer needs more people to drive.
Over like ideally didn't want five of.
The top ten shops right well you can't.
Just have one yeah yeah well maybe you.
Can i'm like yeah but like it's like.
It's like pewdiepie for d life right and.
Right yeah do you know any other.
Streamer sister you want do you live no.
You know any streamers to stream my.
Mixer no but do you know people would be.
Heard of mixer yeah do you know people.
Who stream on twitch yes yep bunch of.
Random people i'm sure so like there's.
No draw there if it's just one we got.
Like five superstars you can do it.
Mm-hmm.
I've seen some extra streamers the.
Number one streamer on mixer that wasn't.
Ninja was a 247 uh radio station so.
They got some ways to go before i'm.
Pretty sure that's illegal as well by.
The way.
But like i'm like always positive that's.
Not allowed but uh the other fridge have.
You ever met ninja or played games with.
Him no never he plays fortnight he's.
He's at the first-person shooter yeah.
Yes i'm not an fps guy he's also like.
Remember what everyone that's on me is a.
Really cool guy really chill guy but.
Like my worlds don't intersect like.
Right i don't leave the house so so i.
Get difficult for me to meet people when.
Like i don't go anywhere.
Um so that's probably the hardest thing.
But yeah i would consider an agent to be.
Like very close like a c or b level like.
A superstar like just in general oh yeah.
Yeah like shays he's like amazing bob.
He's in like mainstream yeah yeah yeah.
Like commercial yeah i'm like i i don't.
Always say this phrase i'm pseudo famous.
So you may know of me if you're like my.
Specific demographic you're like yeah.
You're 18 to 28 living in southern.
California who's also predominantly.
Asian and you really like bubble tea and.
You hang on a k-town it's like.
Like then i'm famous no like nothing.
You're giving yourself man i think.
Anyone who plays or yeah we go get food.
You get stopped hey those people i told.
You are you really what i mean like okay.
So i think what you're saying is true.
And you mate you make a good case you.
Should take that clip and send it to.
Mixer i think what if you were to just.
Like get a few of other big streamers.
For other ones put it put together a.
Pitch and send it to them if they hey.
Give us fifty million dollars bam okay.
It'll be more i mean so like already all.
That stuff my agency's i'm sure talking.
To other are like it's already happening.
Like yeah i already know how could your.
Self we know one of the platforms are.
Talking to you right it's right it's not.
Mixing oh it's not mixing yeah yeah so.
It's someone else but like for me it's.
Like i wouldn't do that work myself i.
Like this i like to think they're like.
That's why i have agents debris media.
Doesn't mean to say yes or no yeah and i.
Wanna focus on just the stuff i'm good.
At you know i like playing league of.
Legends like playing pft i want to.
Create content i don't want to get.
Bogged down by political like politics.
Stuff or i don't wanna get bogged down.
By like things i don't like like mm-hmm.
A lot of times people when you talk to.
Corporate people it's like so how did.
You feel about your brand like what do.
You think your brand outreach your.
Growth and like they start using these.
Buzzwords i'm just like i know what you.
Mean i can understand the english.
Language but the more you talk like this.
The more i don't want to listen right so.
Like i tried i think a lot of our.
Success as a household and a lot of.
Streamer success is the ability to stay.
Authentic to their mm-hmm - they're like.
Brand i'm going to use one of those.
Terms i'm sorry okay sure but like a lot.
Of their success and i think a success.
Of a lot of content creators has been.
Awesome to city and being able to.
Capture that has been really difficult.
For a lot of people you know i'm sure.
You've run into problems where it's like.
Is this you know ryan material is this.
Something i'm proud of.
Sure and maybe you've released things.
That have been successful that you don't.
Like all the time.
It's i mean it does take it's it's a.
Matter of like your own self right leg.
Yes you think people like you said you.
Could do really well but if you're not.
Happy with it then yeah okay well i mean.
A lot of people don't think that way.
Though you know but maybe it's different.
For streaming i mean works on youtube to.
Not be authentic and still be able to.
Get away with it but maybe it's.
Streaming you have to be streaming cuz.
They see you so closely and like right.
If you're a good actor you're in.
Hollywood you're not streaming be like.
For them to see six hours of your life.
You can't act you can't act and fake it.
That long yeah exactly like you will.
Slip up you know right well youtube yeah.
Cut out all the parts like i could be.
Like a completely like pg person if you.
Just ignore ignore me cussing like every.
You know five or ten minutes right so.
Yeah i agree like anything you chopped.
Up and at it you can make me look like i.
Say you can make me look like the devil.
It doesn't really matter but on you.
Streaming yep nope no possible so you.
Said you a lot of people see you as like.
A teacher do you think your appeal to.
And why you're so popular is because.
You're good at the game or because they.
Just genuinely like you okay oh.
Aside from very very very rare cases i.
Think if you're trying to make a name.
For yourself you have to be good at the.
Game okay like you being good at the.
Game is a draw for people to come and.
Watch you there are exceptions you you.
Should be entertaining you should be.
Consistent you like all this stuff.
You should have presence you should be.
Able to like i don't know like all this.
Stuff but i think if you're not good at.
Video games why would people watch what.
What what i mean is you're like there's.
There's being good at games and there's.
Being like you like in the top.
Percentile no i think you need to be the.
Top percent oh okay well there any other.
Cases where like they're just maybe.
Really good-looking or they're just a.
Nice personality or like the show maybe.
You can have success that's not at the.
Top level if that's the case if you want.
To be like a 10,000 plus streamer and.
You cannot suck ass at your video game.
They are known to play especially if.
You're not variety streamer 10,000 plus.
Dollars.
Which i think there's only handful i.
Think people will average 10,000 is less.
Than 50 or like less than 60 if you want.
To be and a lot of those channels are.
Like like tournament channels you know.
So individual wise it might be less than.
Like 40 right but if you're one of those.
People and you're and you're no for.
Streaming one game or one type of game.
So you're not a variety streamer cuz.
People who watch variety streamers like.
Lyric are there for different reasons.
Like they like his personality i don't.
Know how good of a gamer is how.
Completely awesome i'm not watching.
Streaming up to tell uh he oh i could.
Say very confidently is not superstar.
Level like that's super good like a lot.
Of the other streamers read no for one.
Game like league of legends or one game.
Like apex legends or like for a night.
They have to be good that he had you're.
It's even ninja you know who was at the.
Very top of his game he won the first.
Pro-am like he the all the tournaments.
He was the winner so people could he.
Wasn't the best player i can confidently.
Say he has no way in hell but he he won.
All the tournaments he was good enough.
To where he could say he was elite.
Status and a part of what made his.
Appeal drop ended last year he didn't.
Qualify for a world championship this.
Year i heard is really bad right and.
Like as of you are like you don't want.
To watch someone who does who's not good.
Enough to qualify you know there's so.
Many other people i can watch why would.
I bother about with a bother so for yeah.
I think there's an argument to be said.
With that though like with a basketball.
Like lebron he didn't make the playoffs.
When people start watching him just how.
Much do you bring to the table when it.
Comes to video games like if you're not.
Playing you want to watch someone who's.
Good you know he's either good or.
Entertaining and it's very rare to find.
The full package the full package player.
Who's like good entertaining streams a.
Long time yeah yeah all this stuff so uh.
I think if you're especially a exclusive.
Streamer streamer that streams one game.
You have to be good to break the dif i.
Figure mark if you're not who you can't.
Compete i'm a hundred percent serious.
You have to be not just good elite if i.
Wasn't challenger or a grandmaster like.
I was at the very top i would i would.
Lose several thousand of my viewers.
Guaranteed actually my viewership has.
Gone down because i'm not even higher.
Rasili yes oh wow it's that like oh.
Relation is interesting i didn't know.
That.
I thought they were just there i mean.
Like i know like you said if you're good.
At the game you bring in viewers but i.
Thought after they get to know you you.
Know um a lot of people um hardcore fans.
A lot of people like the game so they'll.
Just watch the very top person on the.
Section which is white which is uh.
Discovery system is awful so like.
Youtube has the algorithm which everyone.
Hates and despises but it's phenomenally.
Well well done like it is the most.
Successful algorithm to finding stuff.
That you will watch right in like of.
Anything i know mm-hmm even if it's.
Complete    i hate it hahaha but.
Uh twitches is terrible which is what.
Just a numbers based on numbers you get.
So like if you're not in the first page.
You're not gonna get discovered.
Who's gonna discover you like why would.
I watch people always ask me how do you.
Be a good streamer and i'm just like.
Have a reason for me with a watch like.
What's your niche you know most people.
Anisha's they have to start out being.
Good and then they can work from there.
Like if you could say you're the best x.
In the world people will watch mm-hmm.
But that's it like unless you have that.
Kind of draw no one will ever discover.
You it's kind of like a resume in a way.
Then yeah yeah to some extent you could.
Be like hey i graduated first to.
Stanford but like instead first to.
Stanford like i'm the number one like.
Challenger player in brazil or something.
Like that you know mm-hmm wow well.
That's good to know for all the kids who.
Want to become streamers oh you're not.
You got to be the best in the world it's.
Like start practicing that's some real.
Advice though i think but i i appreciate.
It some people are just like i can do it.
You want to know what's    crazy.
The difference between you play see well.
I like the first tournament or not it's.
A difference becoming up or down mm if i.
Lost three games in a row on stream in.
The first four three weeks i streamed.
Pft i will lose 2,000 viewers three.
Games already have it done to us like a.
Math it's no it's like i watch other.
Streamers and most players most people.
Come in will watch to the end of your.
Game and leave anyways but people will.
Not watch a loser does it worry you then.
That i mean so no i mean because your.
Current viewers    and while you're.
Doing so well right now is because.
You're doing so well at the tft does.
Ever worry you that like all of a sudden.
New game comes out and no one cares.
About tft oh.
Which i mean like the or you don't have.
To switch but if people aren't.
Interested in it oh absolutely but like.
I think at that level like you don't.
Want to worry about too much like for me.
It's like focus on yourself and focus on.
The grind and try to make the best.
Product like i'm confident enough with.
For me as a person that i will excel.
Regardless what happens like if you're.
Gonna ask are are you gonna be.
Successful ten years from now hell yeah.
20 years from hell yeah.
Thirty years from now i'm probably dead.
But if i'm not probably still in success.
Can mean a lot of different things but.
Like mm-hmm i think personally i always.
I'm confident of my ability um and my.
Skill set to find success regarding in.
Any yeah okay well that's a good answer.
Then well this this is basically just.
Like how to become a very successful.
Streamer podcaster been really good this.
Is very helpful advice like thank you.
Thank you for letting us be on i don't.
Want to stream anymore so we got some.
Twitter questions yes some of the fans.
Out there very easy and simple one hmu.
Cesar asks how often do you wear suits.
Never pretty much never steal on the at.
The lcs analyst desk i've been on the.
Last couple days and i were sued to kiwi.
Kids wedding he just got married he's my.
Old teammate you can actually name off.
The occasion so those are the three.
Times i've worn a suit this year oh is.
That so that's a guy inside i think it's.
Just like they saw me recently a suit.
Like a now it's okay i spend most of my.
Paycheck for the lcs desk on that i.
Don't see myself i want to treat myself.
Like i don't spend money on anything i.
Really only spend it on food which i.
Love and that's it skaara actually.
Bought me my first suit oh yeah we went.
To some random bootleg place and like.
They were slightly giving deals for sure.
For suits i'm like baka you go one let's.
So i can get yeah well you didn't need.
What i just looked about yeah.
I see really nice person but yeah it's.
Like that's all that's all i have have.
Feels like i just got to see recently.
And then they're interested so i've.
Spent money on that and then recently i.
Got a mechanical keyboard custom-made.
For myself it's super nice i can't rave.
Enough about this like i want everything.
I own to be custom like ideally cuz ipad.
Okay i don't know if it's like we use.
Mentality by like saying they're like i.
Got this and i'm the only one who owns.
It no that's i mean it's cool i feel.
Like everything right now i was like oh.
You get a participation award and i'm.
Just like i don't want a participation.
Award i want the only one give it to me.
Like and so like you're at that level.
Where you can get i commissioned a.
Friend nathan to build one for me and i.
Got like i think i got i delved into a.
World of mechanical keyboards by the way.
Stupidly expensive like pretty much all.
The stuff you want is like sold out yet.
To buy them i like their secondhand.
Party websites or through people they.
They move up like two times in price and.
It costs like one to two grand to get.
Your final board if you want it done.
Well so i have like a one to two grand.
Board it's super nice and i'm gladly.
Easy for like the next decade and i only.
The only two things i spent money on for.
Like the entire year i'm not even.
Kidding.
Question number two from twitter from.
Griffin hatake does living in a house.
With other streamers caused unnecessary.
Tension and frustration and how do you.
Deal with feeling irritated with each.
Other the mess mess is you make messes.
You make and deciding which is very.
Specific who has more break this down a.
Bit i mean living with other even like.
Creator streamers whatever you want to.
Call it i'm sure there are frustrations.
Right oh yeah absolutely even living.
With living a roommate right but but.
More specifically its you guys all share.
Something together is it do you find.
That more i guess they're saying.
Frustrating but do you find helps okay.
All remember i talked a lot about my.
Problems with recently about like i've.
Streaming every day yeah and all that.
Stuff and part of the reason why i feel.
Like i am not doing as well as the first.
Couple weeks this is toast recently left.
The canada.
His family again and i think him leaving.
Motivated like he motivated me to to be.
Better at tft because me and him nice.
Like bounce off energy like it was kind.
Of like a friendly competition yes.
Because like he's a top one streamer i'm.
Like number four and i was always.
Looking up to him and like i bet i'm.
Gonna beat him i wasn't like do this.
Better i'm gonna do this better and like.
I'm sure he sees that like because i'm.
Hustling he has to hustle as well but.
Like ever since he left like i've had.
Like more like problems in terms of like.
My focus and my motivation and like all.
This    comes up it's like i know it's.
Still a lot more when he just left.
Recently and it feels like like you know.
He helped me out a lot but not just him.
Like it's very motivating to live with.
People who are successful equally minded.
I am true the frustrations come in like.
Terms of like i guess privacy like.
Personal space is not that good i think.
You want more and more of your own.
Personal life as you go grow older like.
Right it's really i i see very few.
People who do where that's not the case.
Usually you enjoy company of others like.
And you're like early 20s and select.
Your late 20s but like once you get your.
Late 20s honestly you looking for a.
Relationship you're looking for like -.
Like really settle down and i think that.
We talk about this a lot we tried to.
Make off on a business and i think.
They're like for the most part like in.
The end we weren't sure we what we had.
Big dreams like we went off fine to be.
Like a maybe a household name all this.
Stuff but then we realized that like.
While we're trying to go for so business.
Oriented stuff between friends not sure.
How long is this gonna like even stay.
Together or us to stay together as a.
Group currently like we may there's a.
Chance that we plan to like just disband.
At the end at the end of like the.
Current lease because just because like.
Not because we hate each other but.
Because it's it's like that time a.
Little house said it's hard to push.
Through the plateau in a way i pushing.
Through a plateau it's like i feel like.
There's a time when people know that you.
Should move on or that you you want to.
Move on and while we're having a great.
Time together and we're being very.
Successful like i think bring us.
Together has made everyone more.
Successful right and we we're like.
Creating lifelong friendships and one of.
The one of the words or.
Instead lily used to say was that you.
Know what they said that it was the best.
Of times in in our last house she it was.
During one of our like we were sitting.
Down like eating like talking she's like.
You know you don't know the best of.
Times until they're gone and she said.
That that could be us right now and i.
Thought i always think about that.
Because i'm just like that deep line.
Yeah i don't know like i really may.
Think i may look back on this and think.
This is probably the or maybe could be.
One of the best times of my life.
Mm-hmm i truly believe that that could.
Be the case and so i'm trying to just.
Not take you for granted i get again.
Right and do the best i can and not.
Really worry about where stuff ends you.
Know cuz it's gonna end at some point.
I'll find it's gonna dissolve because we.
Decided not to like kind of taking new.
Members and not to like kind of expand.
At least currently maybe that changes.
The next couple of months who knows but.
Like we try they make it very very.
Exclusive and by doing so it's like well.
If one person leaves like it's like you.
Know it's like a boy band you know you.
Just can't kick you out    justin.
Timberlake and expect you know the rest.
Of the band to stay together mm-hmm.
Oh we're like a really shitty boyband.
Like you could bring in we're like we're.
Like s club 7 do you remember that real.
Throwback like no one even remembers.
Them in life yeah but yeah like we're.
Like like that you guys are like you.
Guys are a family yeah yeah i actually.
Think of him as my family i'm not i'm.
Not super close to my uh my real family.
Anymore um i had to visit them next year.
By the way i promise my fault my father.
My grandparents my grandfather's last.
Wish before he dies he's 92 right now.
It's the seam his his grandsons and so i.
Have i was like i will definitely go.
Just tell me what so i'm planning a trip.
Next year to see him before he dies.
Where did your family live my family's.
All in china okay.
Also that is that's pretty tough all my.
Fit like my mom dad moved to china.
My brother's studying in med school or.
Trying to go into med school over.
Boston but he just came back from china.
Too so like i was the only person in the.
Country.
For a long time actually talk about my.
Family do you know how my family a.
Little bit we thought about it that's.
Okay it's subject ever you're.
Comfortable okay i've talked about this.
Like i guess maybe three friends i'm.
Knob is that super public because i feel.
Like it's just a little bit awkward.
Talked about okay um so my family does.
Pretty well in china i would say uh my.
Aunt owns the four largest hospitals in.
Sean high also very well uh yes so.
Fairly well uh like i learned a lot of.
Interesting things my grandfather or one.
Of my grandfather's yeah one of my.
Grandfather's did train ten thousand.
People for the beijing opening olympics.
Wow he was one of the eight generals in.
The chinese art i think it's called.
General is where like there's eight.
Different people who controls at least.
Like ten thousand people i have no idea.
It's really weird but like he retired.
Recently but he was the one who trained.
The opening ceremony he's trained for.
Six months they cut down from ten.
Thousands like eight or seven and so.
Like yeah you saw the beijing olympic.
Ceremony when they ran across the screen.
All that said my grandfather my.
Grandparents trained that my my dad's.
Younger brother is like one of the.
Number one contact lawyers in the.
Country or like and he graduated like.
First in his class from mit something.
Like that my my dad's like one of the.
Best offshore engineering platforms in.
The country he got hired by chinese.
Government and he wanted a number one.
Civilian award last year wow which is.
Great for me because they could just get.
They could just give me visas for free.
It's actually excellent bunch of so like.
Actually like like my father's.
Generation i could i consider me like.
Like the generation of miracles you know.
Like kind of like you know talking about.
You know they're like the generation of.
Miracles and like they see our.
Generation is like the failure.
Generation like they always what did.
What do they think about your career.
Choice.
Oh they actually like i think most of.
Them like me cuz i'm like the most.
Successful although like everyone else.
Is like it's like you don't know where.
Do they get it though oh yeah yeah cuz.
Like it's like it's huge engine it's.
Legal x's and all the fan.
Chai's places all this stuff they don't.
Sign with like nike and    like that.
And any wild    china but so like in.
China in some countries you can have.
Money without power okay it's possible.
Or vice-versa in china it's not possible.
If you have power you also have money.
Like it's and so like i would say my my.
Family is relatively powerful in in that.
Country uh-huh and i i'll talk about.
That much because like i don't like to.
Ever have any kind of association with.
Them i don't want to feel like i can.
Always fall back on going to china sure.
Thing and to be honest i'm really like.
Cut off from my family like i i've very.
Rarely talked to them i'm like it's like.
Terrible when i feel people here people.
Have like oh yeah me and my mom like.
Call each other on a monthly basis i'm.
Like yeah me and my mom if she's like i.
Remember and like i don't miss her phone.
Call like maybe we'll talk like once.
Every six months my brother might talk.
Like once every like three months so.
It's like i'm a really like very distant.
Relationship with my family i feel much.
Closer with my family in la like my.
Roommates no they're pretty much my.
Second family.
Didn't i deal with my mic mic closely.
Related like blood ties but it's not.
It's not because there's like animosity.
No i'm just a terrible person like i.
Feel like i do really really badly like.
You know i'm like the worst kind of.
Friend you can have because i will never.
Reach out and ask to do something and so.
Like if you don't interact with me on a.
Daily basis which i don't leave the.
House mm-hmm.
So you can't interact with me unless you.
Live with me i will like like i won't.
Reef refresh the friendship kind of that.
Deal because relationships and.
Friendships are like the same thing you.
Work at them for them to be better you.
Know if you don't work at them you're.
Not gonna develop good friendships and.
Like a lot of times like i'm a very bad.
Person at that and like that.
That's true for like both like my.
Friendship relationships as well as like.
My household like my my actual family.
Relationships now i try to get better at.
It but like that's just let's say it's.
One of my biggest weaknesses but you're.
Working on it yeah i mean when you like.
You said you wanted more you've been.
Living with your family yeah you've been.
Living with these other.
Streamers but you do say you want your.
Own personal space and it's getting to a.
Time where you feel like you're at that.
Age where you want to have your own.
Space uh yeah i know like i think.
Especially when i live with offline.
People i i feel like it's it's weird for.
Me to try to pursue a relationship.
Because i always it's actually really.
Funny because i think of them as like a.
Second family i always compare like if.
I'm interested in girl i'm like what.
Would my my roommates think if i brought.
Her back and there i feel like they.
Wouldn't be like satisfied instantly not.
Interested like my traction level to.
Them doesn't matter as much as like how.
But i think my roommates will judge me.
For the person that hears well they.
Approve that closer yeah at least.
Sometimes i feel that way i talk to.
Other people our house well they feel.
That way too like like they have to be.
You like if i that's tough for the.
Person like i've been in like one.
Serious relationship and then like a.
Couple of things when i like talk to.
People like i'm always just like would i.
Be comfortable bringing the back and the.
Answer is no which has been though a lot.
Of times like i don't bother i'm very.
Private about my relationships people in.
My household don't know if anyone i'm.
Talking to anyone there's multiples.
Before we wrap it up yeah the first.
Thing that popped up when you brought up.
That question of like how do you guys.
Diffuse issues is something is something.
I always think about cuz you told it to.
Me and it was like i was having issues.
At one point and you're like is there.
Anything you can do about it right now.
And right away and i was like no and.
You're like then why are you so focused.
On it focus things that are immediate.
And the things that you can toast with.
Oh dude okay so i we talked about mikey.
Pie big a streamer legal legends.
Teammate one of the biggest things i.
Learned from him is to not give a.
About stuff and i feel like he learned.
That you grow older anyways like.
Predominately with him he only cares.
About a couple things in life it's like.
His friends his cats.
Leisha and league of legends that's it.
Lishus his wife.
Why it's not like they're married and.
It's like he's live in the life like.
He's got the girl.
He's got the game he's got the cat you.
Know he's got he's got everything he.
Cares about that's all he cares about.
He doesn't care about like he's like.
Image he like he wears these like white.
Shirts    he actually moved up a brand.
His mom bought him new white shirt so.
Like $20 but like like he's like he's.
Like flexing with his $20 whitey's now.
But for the most part for the most part.
Like he doesn't give a    about.
Anything like he'll he'll blow money.
Away like he's had yes'm gucci.
Sneakers he has got some nice    but.
He doesn't mainly as a joke you know.
Just cuz he can as opposed to something.
He's actively interested right like i.
Learned to care a lot less about like my.
Appearance to others i learned to care a.
Lot about less about like what i wear.
And i learned to keep focus on what i.
Really care about you know whether it's.
Like my stream whether it's my.
Relationships my friends my roommates.
Are it's helped me focus a lot in terms.
Of like what can i do to get stuff done.
And just ignore everything else cuz i.
Think i think that's made me a lot less.
Like i guess stressed about a lot of.
Different things a lot of people come to.
Me with problems and i'm just like do.
You want me to like actually solve them.
For you or do you want me to like just.
Be a listening like person cuz like i'm.
Really bad at being able to do both at.
Once.
So like i try to have them clarify.
That's actually a really good question.
To ask people because i found like i.
Always try to solve problems exactly.
People don't want like this one a year.
Exactly you know that's actually very.
Important to learn yeah yeah be a good.
Good listener sometimes and so yeah i.
Think well thank you know everybody.
Listening to this well what that being.
