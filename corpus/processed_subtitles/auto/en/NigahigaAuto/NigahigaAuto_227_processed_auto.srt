You know what i don't understand korean.
Dramas or all asian dramas they're all.
Pretty much the same thing and yet.
People spend hours and hours watching.
Them i can pretty much predict what's.
Gonna happen in every single drama first.
They're in love and then they're sad.
Love comes back and then they're mad and.
Then somebody dies and for all of you.
Who don't watch asian dramas this is.
Pretty much what it looks cheap i do not.
Know this one man.
