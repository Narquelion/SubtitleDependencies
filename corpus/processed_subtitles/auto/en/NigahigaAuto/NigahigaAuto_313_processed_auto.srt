Hey guys so i don't know if you guys can.
Tell her not but my voice is gonna be a.
Little bit more annoying than usual.
Because i'm sick in fact i've been sick.
For a while now with be okay that the.
Illness has been gone for a while now.
But really though i have been sick for.
Like two or three weeks so i apologize.
For my voice and also my my hair which i.
Did not cut i don't know why i never.
Remember to cut my hair before i vlog i.
Know so many of you wonderful people.
Loved to point out how ugly my hair gets.
Minutes long but being the extremely.
Self confident person that i am it's a.
Good thing i don't care what you guys.
Think about my iboga oh now that works.
What you love those days when you have.
Magical sneezes anyway i'm pretty sure.
You guys know what memes are and one of.
My favorite means is the unpopular.
Opinion meme you know the one where.
People write their opinion on something.
That most people don't agree with either.
That or they agree with it and they're.
Too scared to say it out loud why did.
You guys know i'm always gonna give you.
Guys my honest opinion as unpopular as.
It may be i mean it does get me into.
Trouble sometimes but this isn't tv you.
Can't tell me what to say can't tell me.
What the thing this is youtube i can say.
Whatever i won this is the land of the.
Free in the home of the bees what yep.
Definitely have to pill today anyway.
Today's topic can be another touchy one.
Cyberbullying if you watch my draw my.
Life video you know that i was bullied a.
Lot when i was younger so of course i.
Think bullying is a problem but recently.
It seems like cyber bullying is like the.
Main topic that people report on these.
Days you know from articles to new.
Stations to groups being started on.
Facebook just to target cyber bullying.
Well i'm just gonna come out and say it.
This is my unpopular opinion for the day.
Cyber bullying is a first-world problem.
There i said it now bring on the hate.
Comments not just kidding don't cuz that.
Would be cyberbullying look don't get me.
Wrong i do believe that cyberbullying is.
A problem but don't you think we should.
Be more focused on regular bullying.
That's done in person coming from.
Somebody who was bullied in real life i.
Don't think it's really bullying if you.
Can escape it and i was being bullied in.
School there was no escape i felt like i.
Was being backed into a corner to the.
Point where i wanted to kill myself cuz.
I thought i had no other option i was.
Forced to be there with him i was forced.
To go to school i was forced to go to.
Classes with them if i had the choice i.
Would have avoided them at all cost if.
You're being cyber bullied whether it's.
On facebook or twitter or whatever.
Social media you are not being backed.
Into a corner you have so many options.
You have the option to unfriend your.
Boys you have the option to block your.
Bullies you have the option to escape.
Your bullies by deleting your entire.
Account you are not being forced to be.
There having social.
Media is not something you need to live.
And there's no law saying that you have.
To be on it.
Unlike school that's your own choice i.
Believe that if you're gonna choose to.
Be on social media you're gonna have to.
Learn how to deal with it if you can't.
Handle it then just don't be on it.
There's no shame in that because no.
Matter how much people try to stop.
Bullying through empathetic news stories.
Or campaigns i honestly believe that.
Bullying especially cyberbullying is.
Never gonna stop.
That's just how some people are and also.
On a side note all those stop bullying.
Campaigns where all people do is hashtag.
Stop bullying does almost nothing in my.
Opinion i'm pretty sure there aren't any.
Bullies that looks at a tweet with.
Hashtag stop bullying and things oh okay.
Yeah stop and for all the kids that are.
Being bullied that do see that hashtag.
I'm pretty sure they're not gonna be.
Thinking huh that'll stop them instead.
Of campaigning to try and stop bullying.
I think there should be more campaigns.
Trying to teach kids how to deal with.
Bullying i'm sure at the time i would.
Appreciate that a lot more hashtag.
Bullying isn't going away so let's teach.
The kids how to deal with bullying and.
Other stuff yeah that's pretty catchy.
That'll catch on i can honestly say to.
All you kids out there that are being.
Bullied right now if you can survive.
Being bullied it's gonna make you a.
Stronger person when you get older not.
Older older well i guess older too i.
Think the real way people are not aggro.
Is either inspiration or desperation and.
If you're being bullied to the point of.
Desperation where you feel like you have.
No options you're gonna figure out.
Something a little off topic but other.
Than mentioning it and might draw my.
Life video i never really told my story.
In detail publicly before being bullied.
Is not something you're typically proud.
Of kind of want to just erase those.
Years i don't know the next time i'm.
Gonna be talking about bullying so here.
Is my story cue emotional music and i.
Was little boy i never thought i'd make.
It out okay that's a little too dramatic.
Let's tone it down so when i was going.
Into sixth grade i moved to a charter.
School where i basically didn't know.
Anyone and i already stood out because i.
Was really really short and skinny at.
The time and there was also not many.
Asians there and blessed because it was.
A charter school we all took a placement.
Test to see which group we would be in.
And to this day i still don't know how.
But i scored really well on that test.
And they put me with the older kids so i.
Was even smaller in comparison to and.
From there it was pretty much like i was.
In a movie in terms of getting bullied.
Things that i saw in movies that i.
Thought never happened in real life.
Happened to me i mean it wasn't anything.
Crazy but i would get shoved pushed to.
The ground praying tea made fun of her.
Being small and asian this went on.
Pretty much every single day i used to.
Make all these random excuses to my mom.
Why i couldn't go to school until i.
Finally told her why and remember she.
Called the principal one night and the.
Next day we all had this big assembly to.
Talk about how we shouldn't be bullying.
Mother and that pretty much did nothing.
And at the time i just hated like i used.
To stay up every single night feeling.
Angry and sorry for myself sometimes i'd.
Be so frustrated that i have thoughts of.
Just bringing my metal back to school.
Just start swinging away at these.
Bullies but then i come to my senses and.
Realize that i don't want to go to jail.
I'd rather be dead than go to jail which.
Actually led to even darker thoughts but.
Luckily i'd fall asleep and in the.
Morning be somewhat grateful that i.
Didn't do it but then i remember one.
Specific night i was just sick of.
Feeling angry and sorry for myself and i.
Started to think in a different way.
Sorry i chose to think in a different.
Way i remember thinking to myself that.
Everything happens for a reason i'm.
Being bullied for a reason my bullies.
Are bullying me for a reason and i just.
Asked myself why and i came to realize.
That everything they did was just to.
Make each other laugh and i was just the.
Easiest target so then i thought how can.
I take that away from them and once i.
Started thinking like that i changed my.
Entire outlook on the situation i made.
Everything a challenge no matter how.
Much someone was gonna prank me or do.
Stuff to me to make each other laugh i.
Was gonna make them laugh if one of the.
Bullies made fun of me i would go with.
It and make their joke my joke like if.
One of them said why don't you open your.
Eyes you little chink i would say what.
Do you mean chink i know understand and.
Then everyone laughed because they.
Weren't expecting me to say anything and.
Just like that it was my joke and then.
If i got tripped or shoved to the ground.
I'd make a joke out of it i remember.
This one time one of the guys were.
Behind me and they did that thing where.
You take a step and they kick your back.
Leg trip and fall down and i did and.
Basically he said move it jab and i.
Would just be like man richard that was.
A good one you're so strong.
Shut up okay i don't know i didn't seem.
Like i want that time but then i just.
Kept doing it over and over and.
Eventually it stopped.
I took the fun out of it i didn't get.
Mad i didn't retaliate i just made it a.
Joke like i wanted to fall down and.
Instead of being known as the small.
Nerdy asian kid i was known as the small.
Nerdy asian kid that was sometimes funny.
Nobody wants to bully the small nerdy.
Asian kid that's sometimes funny because.
That's just me but that's basically my.
Story.
Cool story broke thank you that's what.
It would sound like if you were here i.
Started using comedy as a defense and.
Then i just fell in love with making.
People laugh which led to me making.
Videos and now i'm here talking to you.
Guys and for all of you out there that.
Are going for the same thing it doesn't.
Mean that if you do what i did it's.
Gonna work for you you have to figure.
Out your own situation the point is for.
All of you out there who feel like.
You're being back into a corner and you.
Have no other options just remember and.
Know that you're not going to be there.
Forever and if you manage to survive it.
It's gonna make you a stronger and.
Smarter person when you get older i.
Don't know it based on a little messed.
Up.
And another unpopular opinion by being.
Bullied is kind of a blessing in a.
Really really good disguise because if.
You get to that point of desperation.
Where you're backed into a corner and.
You feel like you have no options and.
You still survive it at least for me you.
Live with this thought that there's.
Nothing that you can't do because you've.
Been in a situation with no options and.
You still made it i can honestly say.
That looking back i'm almost thankful to.
My bullies because without them i.
Probably wouldn't be talking to you guys.
Right now in fact if you happen to be.
Watching this video for some reason you.
Know exactly what you are i forgive you.
For everything i wouldn't be who i am or.
Where i am today without you so in a way.
Thank you.
Whoa when super off-topic on this one.
Sorry i get really passionate when i.
Talk about bullying but anyway thank you.
Guys so much for watching i know this.
Wasn't the funniest video but it's.
Something i've always wanted to talk.
About remember to post the hashtag.
Bullying isn't going away so let's teach.
Kids how to deal with them and stuff i.
Don't think that was it and also.
Remember if you're being booked if.
You're being bullied.
Applause.
