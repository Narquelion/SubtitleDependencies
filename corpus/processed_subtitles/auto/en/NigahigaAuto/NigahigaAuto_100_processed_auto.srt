Delays hi i'm ryan higa and here at a.
Dry airlines we've always believed that.
Your experience flying did not just be.
Good not just great not even just an.
All-around amazing experience so that's.
What we do.
Our motto here at ever i airlines has.
Always been just that even though you.
Paid for this flight we don't work for.
You we're gonna be as rude and.
Condescending as we want gonna like a dj.
You know push a couple buttons have a.
Couple sips before you know it we're.
There pay me so we got this game right.
It's kind of like the mini olympics but.
With bets you take a luggage but a.
Half's add that little red sticker on it.
Rather than placing it down nice sleep.
We shall put it on to the plane and if.
We hear anything broken or anything in.
Pieces and you lose.
Oh it's for fun but it also makes us be.
Careful with everyone's frag lea stuff.
One of my pet peeves are when people ask.
For things but we take customer service.
Very seriously here so immediately after.
We're finished doing what we're doing.
Like gossiping and taking a nap or.
Eating our food will not the customers.
Food the good food we go over to the.
Customer and politely say what sometimes.
We like to do this thing up here we turn.
The entertainment system all the way.
Down so when the passengers put their.
Headphones on they turn it up they can't.
Even hear anything and then out of.
Nowhere i pick up the pa and.
You're the spit out oh but even with our.
Incredible staff the fry airlines.
Wouldn't be what it is today without the.
Help of all of you our loyal @vy.
Airlines members show up to almost every.
Single flight from the parents who.
Ignore their screaming kids member who.
The angry business man shouting on his.
Cell phone for the whole plane to hear.
For the guy who didn't learn shapes as a.
Kid to the armrest hugger the leg.
Spreader a guy who sits window but has.
To pee every 20 minutes the overly.
Friendly guy who talks the whole flight.
Despite seeing you trying to sleep even.
The guy who was constantly farting.
Thinking we don't know it's him and even.
Though we have funnier to write airlines.
We always take your safety very.
Seriously with our newly updated on a.
Safety demonstration video hello and.
Welcome to a wright airlines this is.
Your safety demonstration video which.
None of you are actually going to listen.
To but we're going to do it anyway so.

Emergency exits on this aircraft in the.
Unlikely event of surviving a plane.
Crash and life vest is located in a.
Pouch underneath your seat but so is a.
Luggage of the guy sitting behind you so.
You probably won't have access to it in.
The event of a change in air pressure.
And oxygen masks will automatically.
Appear in front of you if you don't.
Already know how to put on a mask and.
Breathe chances are you're not going to.

Children's boogers located underneath.
