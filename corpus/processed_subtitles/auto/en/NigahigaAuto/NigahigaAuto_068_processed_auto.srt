Right now we're in the desert this is no.
Place for fun and games you do not want.
To get lost out here but every year.
Stupid tourists get lost out here every.
Week got a little rough on the dismount.
But we're good let's go it's been nearly.
Three minutes and i'm completely.
Starving i need to eat fast or my.
Tummy's gonna hurt have to be really.
Careful he's one of the most dangerous.
Creatures of the desert the hippopotamus.
I don't think he saw me yet so we're.
Still good but i was wrong all right.
Sneak up from his rear grab them that's.
Why i'll take them right this is.
Incredibly dangerous so don't ever try.
This at home do it somewhere else.
It was a bit risky but it's gonna be.
Worth it you can pretty much find these.
Uh these canned vegetables pretty much.
Anywhere you go especially in the.
Deserts i just gotta know where look and.
That it's just that it's just awful this.
Is just awful.
It was awful luckily uh.
There's a technique that i heard about.
From my mother's father's grandson where.
You just take a big whiff that is much.
Much better.
The ancient natives use this technique.
To absorb half the vitamins and minerals.
Because half the taste is in the smell.
All right we really need to get moving.
We have a lot of ground to cover.
I have to get moving now before the sun.
Goes down because i'm afraid of ghosts.
And that's about enough for today.
I need to find some shelter please well.
Time to find some shelter because i.
Don't know what time it's gonna get dark.
Here but i luckily uh i usually i.
Usually have a watch but uh let me have.
My cell phone so i can use it like a.
Sundial.
30 p.m.
Right now so i we really need to get.
Started.
The ancient natives use this technique.
With their cell phones but it's not.
Always completely accurate i was off by.
About 6 hours i have to work hastily.
Because the sun is going down and i need.
Something to protect me from all the.
Predators and aliens so i've been.
Working about five hours now and i think.
I think i got enough shelter to last me.
The night here.
But it's no time for rest i have to get.
Moving this terrain is incredibly.
Disorientating but luckily i can.
Navigate using the stars so if you can.
Find the star all you have to do is.
Follow it and it will always always lead.
You home 50% of the time unfortunately.
For me this was not one of those times.
I'm completely lost.
