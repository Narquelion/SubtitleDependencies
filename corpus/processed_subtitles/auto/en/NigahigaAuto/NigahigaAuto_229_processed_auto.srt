Hey guys as you know i made a bunch of.
Rants a while back you want to see them.
Well you can't because of copyrighted.
Music those videos are no longer.
Available for you to view so i'm gonna.
Be recreating those rents and more.
Starting off with music what happened to.
Music nowadays people are making songs.
That i don't even consider music anymore.
It's pretty much like fast repetitive.
Words with a beat yet artists are making.
Millions of dollars and i don't get it.
It's like they come up with a line and.
They're like this sounds pretty good i.
Think i'll repeat it 20 times in one.
Song what is the world coming to.
Imagine if books were like that there.
Were three things i was absolutely.
Positive first edward was a vampire.
Second there was a part of him that.
Thirsty for my blood and third edward.
Was a vampire see how stupid that sounds.
Now imagine if music were like that pop.
Up out pokerface pop pop pokerface ma ma.
Ma ma wait a second it already is like.
That but seriously i thought music was.
Supposed to have meaning and even if.
Those repetitive songs do have meaning.
It's kind of like okay we get what you.
Mean now move on anyway another thing i.
Don't like is when artists make songs.
Telling you what to do for example you.
Crank that soulja boy i don't want to.
Crank you i don't even know what that is.
And next lean like a cholo come on a.
Cholo don't even speak greek and last.
One of my favorites the song say my name.
By destiny's child say my name say my.
Name first of all i can say whatever i.
Feel like saying destiny's child second.
Of all i don't even know your name i.
Know your mother's name destiny.
However there is one really really.
Talented artist my favorite of all.
That's right sean paul and for those of.
You who don't know who sean paul is he's.
The only guy in the entire world that.
Can create a whole song using his own.
Language that nobody can understand i.
Mean seriously how do you even talk to.
Somebody like that hey sean paul just.
Give me the light what just give me the.
Light what sean a ball sean a ball yes.
That's your name someone give it to.
Twirl girl just give me the light and.
Bout to draw.
Lucky man i gotta know which one i'm.
Gonna get my blog yes and if you are one.
Of those people who can actually.
Understand what he's saying well then.
You should be very proud of yourself.
Because you are only one of the few the.
Proud the marines anyway the more of the.
Story is rap is alive music is dead.
That's all i have to say i'm going to.
Bed peace and that's when i realized the.
Greatest rapper of all time was dr.
Seuss.
