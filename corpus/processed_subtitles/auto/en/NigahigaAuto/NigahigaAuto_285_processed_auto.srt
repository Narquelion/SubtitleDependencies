The fact that we're talking about.
Technically we shouldn't be talking.
About it is what the messes are trying.
To say yeah in this conspiracy but so if.
We die don't say that vancouver and.
Toronto gossip.
Hot girls i know you guys are taking but.
They got huh i mean doesn't mean we.
Can't acknowledge that japan was by far.
Our favorite trip bullet oh pop it.
Kick it twist it no you just drop it and.
You break it all right claps claps claps.
Oh no i turned it in welcome back to.
Another episode of off the peel podcast.
We got our usual okay that's enough of.
That.
I was trying to be a house trying to be.
A producer dude we have our usual cast.
Back cast back.
Hi did you introduce them yeah will and.
Will not a lot of people know my name is.
Willy surprised you know down that's.
Gonna be your guys group name i used to.
Go by willy you didn't really sauce well.
That was just an inappropriate gamer.
Name that had but when i was a little.
Kid oh really you didn't know that yeah.
I wasn't trying to make you almost like.
A twelve-year-old i didn't know that i.
Didn't know that's why you named.
Yourself that good start i was funny.
Not anymore i was oh man.
Okay well we can't say that but this is.
Will why can't we say that we could i.
Guess we could yeah it's your podcast.
I'm will i'm paco no you so say and i'm.
Will i know i'm will and i'm will.
And i'm ryan together we're ryan and the.
Willie sauce all right what song is that.
I don't know where that came from.
Looks like paramore um we do not have a.
Sponsor today but you know what cool huh.
Doing way way oh nice too late yeah but.
I guess what could be a fake sponsor is.
Your foundation yep i'm going right in.
Today yes i do have a nonprofit that i.
Don't remember when that video came out.
It was on second channel something.
Usable two years ago cuz i'll still it.
Wasn't anyway a lot of people don't know.
About it but the idea kind of came from.
It's kind of like a make-a-wish.
Foundation but instead of sick kids it's.
Going towards the caregivers so it's.
Almost like without them knowing so it's.
Instead of making a wish it's like.
Giving somebody an unexpected surprise.
Yeah like someone who's selfless yeah so.
The first one we did was this girl that.
We heard about through a well my mom.
Heard about through a newspaper back in.
Hilo and she was like this she just does.
Everything she's part of the peace corps.
And she uh just like right out of high.
School she went to like africa to help.
Spread like aids awareness and stuff.
Like that she was a beast basically she.
Did so many things it seems unrealistic.
It's like this is too good of a person.
So she was our first person that we you.
Know did something for and then we.
Talked to her mom secretly this is.
Basically how it works we reach out to.
You know a friend or a family member who.
Wants to nominate this person obviously.
They didn't know about the foundation so.
We didn't wait for someone to nominate.
We had to like basically just go and.
Find the mom and we secretly talked to.
Her and said is there anything we want.
To do this best day ever.
That's what the foundation is called so.
That's not what it's called that's what.
The show was called the foundation is.
The ryan higa foundation org and.
Essentially we reached out and we found.
Out that she needed a car she didn't ask.
For it she didn't even the mom didn't.
Even ask for it but she said is theirs.
We said is there something that your.
Daughter is gonna need cuz she's going.
Off to college and really what she.
Needed was a car so we ended up getting.
Our car but that's just one example not.
Saying we're gonna go and help cars to.
Everybody but if you're out there and.
You know somebody who's like done a lot.
Of good things or you just really want.
Them to have their best day ever go to.
Ryan higa.
Foundation org yeah nominate them and.
There's a video don't remember what it's.
Called or older huh what's the video.
Called on technol it's well the show's.
Best day ever.
Cuz your idea is to give somebody who.
Deserves it their best day ever.
Not that getting a car is her best day.
Ever but it's just the show know what uh.
Like what would qualify someone this is.
Somebody who like you know work hard or.
Make edits podcasts and you know yeah i.
Mean if they're a good person.
Sure they've done beyond he's a good.
Person i'm out you if they go above and.
Beyond like like a like a teacher you.
Know you hear those stories like the.
Teachers always they're broke but they.
Spend all their money to their salary on.
It it's kind of kind of like those.
Typical shows you see on like the news.
You know how they do like those segments.
Where they surprised people yeah but i'm.
Trying to turning into a show at the.
Same time.
Yeah that's cool that's cool so i mean.
We just need nominations to find good.
People you have to be 13 at least or.
Older than obviously to nominate legal.
Reasons and then right as of now i think.
It's only in the us the the nominee.
Nominate from wherever you are but the.
Nominee should be in the us just for now.
Okay we're not big enough yet very cool.
Super cool yeah anyway off from the.
Foundation since we got right to it i'm.
Gonna bring it up at the end i mean he.
Just felt like later you know do it.
After this you break if you want yeah.
Laughter.
What uh what's on the agenda today dude.
Life is on the agenda.
Dana's sick she was yes or dana and.
You're leaving you're going to japan.
Wanna japan you're so lucky i'm not what.
Are you talking about what do you mean.
Okay then stay then oh you're not lucky.
Okay stay then no don't leave tamara.
Worked hard for this one okay oh did you.
Uh no but i mean it's just an expression.
Taco yeah you guys remember the game.
Fatal frame xbox game.
That sounds really i never had the.
Scariest games it's meant to be scared.
You take you go around basically and you.
Take pictures i do see like it's not.
It's not meant for kids i don't think i.
Do remember that was really scary yeah.
It was a fun group game to play with.
People mm-hmm i like i don't know maybe.
That's where my my enjoyment of seeing.
Other people scream it scary movies.
Comes from were you the one playing it.
Or just wanting to do as a group huh did.
You play it or watch it like when both.
Yeah i was trying to watch it i couldn't.
Play it's too scary you're kind of like.
A weird sicko like why is that weird.
No no cuz you like my people like that.
How much you like seeing other people be.
Scared not necessarily but i mean i.
Don't a lot of people like those.
Compilations of people getting scared.
You don't watch those videos and think.
It's funny no i don't it depends on the.
Reaction yeah they could be pretty funny.
I don't i don't usually watch those it's.
Like something ellen does she scares.
People yeah it's like yeah those are.
Like nice gears like ah yours is like.
Dude let's go watch this movie like the.
Conjuring it's good okay that's a good.
Movie yeah but you just always like.
Anytime you go and see a scary movie you.
Always invite the whole group you like.
Anybody wanted to watch this movie.
Greg's always like just doesn't respond.
Or something yeah but i mean it's it's.
Just the kind of movies i like oh yeah.
Sure do you uh anything wrong with that.
Or weird about it dude a lot of people.
Like scary movies i like scary movies i.
Do want to figure out why i get that.
Enjoyment though i go into scary movies.
And i base how good it is based on like.
Man i actually felt something i like to.
Feel something when i watch movie.
Whether it's happiness sadness or if a.
Movie makes you feel something it's a.
Good movie yeah and it's really hard for.
You especially according to the last.
Podcast yeah you're a robot that is not.
True.
But it is but if something makes if a.
Movie makes me feel anything i think.
It's a good movie.
That means i got sucked into it yeah.
It's probably also with scary movies is.
If you actually feel scared when you'd.
Like don't expect it or ever because.
It's easy for like like you were saying.
Or i remember we talked about this a.
Long time ago we're like jump scares are.
Kind of like the easy way out.
Yeah but when the movies use all their.
Like tricks to make you feel scared yeah.
That's when you're like whoa it's the.
Building of the anxiety yeah it's not.
Really the actual jump scare.
At i mean that's just like the that's.
Like a fart joke in comedy it's like the.
Easiest way to get a laugh or do the.
Screech that makes both you guys laugh.
No but like jump scares you you told me.
This and this is how he kind of.
Convinced me to go watch more scary.
Movies ryan was like horror and comedy.
Have a lot in common because those are.
The only two genres that rely heavily on.
Timing heavily yeah yeah it they're all.
About timing and that's why kind of.
Jordan peels movies have like exactly.
Done so well i mean he's like he's a.
Comedic genius yeah.
And he's able to translate that into.
Like horror so maybe you want to talk.
About a little bit cuz that's actually.
Something that you're interested in yeah.
I mean i from even before get out you.
Know it inspired me but b even before.
That i was like i've alway mean you guys.
Know i've always like people ask me all.
You want to make a movie.
My natural gut is to go and make a.
Horror movie that's what i would have.
Want to create more so than like a.
Comedy movie because the only reason is.
Because i feel like it's so similar in.
Terms of timing and it's something new.
Yeah and i feel like it's it's fun to do.
I don't know maybe something is wrong.
With me alex just carefully i like to.
Give people.
I don't know increase their heart rates.
I don't know what it is mmm something's.
Wrong with me dude you should make human.
Centipede for is there a third one there.
Is a third one oh my man if people who.
Have not seen it don't not one of the.
Ones that i think is considered a great.
Horror movie but it's great shock value.
Do you remember playing scary games.
Growing up.
Scary games what yeah like like you were.
Saying with the fatal friend do you.
Remember that that was the only one man.
It wasn't like your genre you play games.
Oh there wasn't many i mean resident.
Evil did you get scared of diablo first.
Time you play oh no did you remember the.
First boss the butcher yeah i had to.
Have my brother come to kill him cuz i.
Was scared.
Yeah he was scary i guess i don't know.
Something about i don't know i wasn't in.
Film at the time or wasn't into making.
Videos yeah but like it's easier now.
Because when.
Watch those horror movies or like it.
Not just horror movies anything that.
Takes you out of the film like a horror.
Movie or something that you're really.
Into it's hard for me to not picture how.
They're filming it if that makes sense.
Yeah yeah like if there's a shot where.
It's just like in the music's building.
I'm picturing like the editor damn why.
Are they turning up their volumes so.
High right here obviously something's.
Gonna happen if not they're gonna cut to.
Something else and then like i'm already.
Pre-planning so many steps ahead because.
I'm trying to picture how their timeline.
Looks like yeah and it's so not fun but.
If there's a really good movie that.
Sucks me in that i don't think about.
That stuff yeah.
That's on you i don't know that makes.
Sense i that's the only way i can try to.
Get out of movies cuz i get sucked in.
Very easily that's why i don't like.
Watching scary movies cuz even though i.
Know it's not real mm-hmm like i'll just.
Be like oh it immersed yeah i get super.
Like just i'm in it that's why that's.
That's why i like when we talked about.
It last time when i had to go oh dude.
That's the only way i can get out at.
Them verbally say something to be like.
I'm in a movie i'm in a movie.
Get me out of here like after the.
Conjuring when i went to the cloud yeah.
I turned all the lights on yeah wasted.
Your electricity dude i turned like ryan.
You made me see this movie after i.
Didn't make you it's fun no i don't you.
You don't regret it no i don't because.
There's a good story really good yeah it.
Was it was funny though even like when i.
Watch dude you and arden are probably.
Like the worst people or or best.
Depending on which to see horror movies.
With because that's what scares me is.
You guys person who next to you that.
Grabs you on a not so scary part will.
Scare the    out of me i've never.
Grabbed no but you'll yell i will you'll.
Yell and it's i like kind of get a.
Little bit mad cuz i'm like that's not.
Part of the scare but like it scares me.
And i'm like that's not that shouldn't.
Happen that's a jump scare you know how.
To get you you do you do.
People like scare you more it's more.
Scary than the movie yeah and it's a.
Little upsetting cuz you're like man.
They just jump scared they fart joke.
Damn we did go off top let's go listen.
Let's go through some of the interesting.
Stuff we have here so i mean it's not.
Interested is interesting to me but um i.
Didn't know who he was until like today.
Uh-huh not that's not necessary sure i.
Didn't really know much about and how do.
You.
Nipsey hussle nipsey hussle so he just.
Died.
Yes very young but by the time this.
Comes out that's true a few days this.
Week yeah he just died he just passed.
Away this week cuz he was shot in a in.
Front of his store own store and you.
Know a little bit more about it so well.
Yeah he's a rapper he's a rapper but.
He's also like a huge community activist.
Yeah he did a lot for his communities.
Just just bringing awareness and.
Everything like that and was trying to.
Build people up in terms of like.
Employment in his stores i saw a couple.
Of videos talking about how he employed.
Artists who were trying to make it but.
Also needed money so this is how this is.
How they would hustle this is how they.
Would grind and his mindset was just.
About like bringing like positivity and.
Stuff and a quote actually i mean he had.
Such an impact on the community that.
Mark ride lee thomas hope it's how i.
Said his name is a member of the los.
Angeles county board of supervisors who.
Represents the southern part of the city.
Released a statement sunday night saying.
His district mourn the loss of hustle oh.
Dude i'm gonna butcher his name i know i.
Just saw that it was like oh i can't.
Wait to part mice - i don't know known.
To us as the hip-hop artists nipsey.
Hussle was a father businessman.
Entertainer and an inspiration to many.
With really tommy so this is a common i.
Mean this is like a common thing that is.
This is why i heard of him because every.
Celebrity not every majore him his.
Celebrities came out and they they were.
Showing like such respect and like such.
I mean you know they do that a lot times.
When people pass away but yeah it was.
Like a consensus like this is such a.
Good guy he you know naturally i'm gonna.
Look him up i looked him up i saw all.
The great things he did but there was.
Also something that just.
Right before the podcast i wasn't even.
Searching conspiracy or anything but.
This thing popped up on my facebook.
Timeline and it was a conspiracy about.
His death and i'm like oh here we go.
Again just cuz someone dies and gets.
Shot it doesn't mean there's a.
Conspiracy mm-hmm but then i looked into.
It you know i love my conspiracies you.
Love them and there's you know what.
There is i mean i i haven't done enough.
Research of something i'm gonna say how.
Do i give a disclaimer like don't take.
Everything i say as a fact but take you.
Know a grain of salt.
Take it with a grain of sugar i don't.
Know why i changed it anyway if you look.
At the conspiracy in super inch i only.
Looked it up for like an hour so i don't.
Don't um don't knock me if i get it.
Wrong yeah our own research essentially.
Yeah do your own research but from what.
I've read and i've only checked it sites.
Obviously they could be wrong and they.
Could be saying the same thing yeah the.
Conspiracy was that he was releasing a.
Documentary or making a documentary.
About this doctor doctor said dr. seuss.
Abbey who claims that he got a or he.
Created a cure for aids i don't think.
It's claimed he actually proved it in a.
95 yeah okay well he proved it that he.
Has a cure for aids and hiv right you.
Know in a court i don't know about hiv i.
Think just aids isn't that the same age.
Any leads to aids no well we just doing.
Okay i think it was oh it could be eight.
Well regardless it's everybody knows we.
We know aids as being incurable right.
But he has proven that it was c i don't.
Even know if i can say that it was.
Proven i don't know the article said.
That okay so it's not us we're reporting.
What we saw yes cured aids essentially.
And everybody knows i mean in the whole.
Especially the conspiracy world people.
Know that if you if you just like curing.
Cancer or hearing aids like selling the.
Treatment is a lot more profitable than.
Selling a cure because then you get to.
Build them every step of the way yeah.
You know there's always that conspiracy.
And basically there's there's i'm gonna.
Give that really yeah that's crazy yeah.
There i mean like people talk about oh.
There's been a cure for cancer it's just.
That it makes so much money treating.
Walls than it does curing them they're.
The pharmaceutical companies make more.
Money off of a country being sick than a.
Country being wealthy or a healthy.
Healthy arm it's all the pharmaceutical.
Side.
Could be maybe you know i mean they.
Could have investment you and me on the.
Conspiracy i'm telling you you do you.
Should look into it you don't have to.
Necessarily believe everything with a.
Grain of sugar and just like you know.
Look it up and but basically there's.
There's more to it but you told me some.
Stuff that was interesting you brought.
Up about i was just talking to you.
Before this went live there is another.
Artist by so essentially um in the.
Article that i had read dr. stubby and.
This is up that i've heard even before.
This event right but doctor said we had.
Found a cure and he got stopped like at.
An airport or something i think in.
Honduras and basically he got stopped.
For having too much money on him right.
And then he got detained and while in.
Custody he died three days later due to.
Fighting a battle with pneumonia but the.
The big conspiracy is how could one of.
The world's most healthy men suddenly.
Died to pneumonia within three days so a.
Lot of people are draw up the idea of he.
Was executed you know possibly.
Conspiracy yeah there's there's no.
Actual evidence right and then i believe.
There's an artist by the name of left.
Eye or something yeah it's a woman yeah.
What did she do she she was talking.
Basically talking talking about it and.
Trying to bring awareness turnabout from.
Tlc but she essentially from what i read.
Again that much i probably look more.
Into it but she was murdered as well.
Right oh well she wasn't murdered she.
Was in a car crash a car crash but.
People again suspect because she was.
Talking about and bringing awareness to.
It and then this whole thing happened.
Because you know named she also was.
Making a documentary that's yeah yeah oh.
Lisa left eye lopes hmm good for you you.
Know you're so hip i know some things.
About the culture but yet so that this.
Whole thing came up and it's very.
Regardless it's a little suspicious yeah.
And he also has a quote i believe that.
People have been tweeting and stuff.
Saying that uh what was the exact quote.
I have it somewhere.
It's basically he said if i if they kill.
Me for.
Documentary or he says here it is if.
They kill me for this documentary y'all.
Better ride for me not that i really.
Know one ride for me means what is right.
For me me and barry down for me like.
They know what i was about you better.
Ride for me maybe she's like maybe like.
Put keep pushing it so i saw that nick.
Cannon actually instagrammed it or.
Something that he's saying he's gonna.
Finish the documentary yeah and i'm like.
Dude mmm that's date like and twitter.
Was like protect me again yeah and all.
This stuff like but if you have to go.
About it though i mean like you would.
Say publicly you're gonna finish the.
Documentary people know if something.
Happens to him we know it it is like.
There's still no way to prove it though.
So i wonder this is kind of like not a.
Side thing but has there ever been a.
Conspiracy that was like pretty big that.
Actually got proven in it transferred.
From conspiracy theory to fact and then.
Action was taken has that ever happened.
I'm sure i'm sure there has been maybe.
When everybody thought the world was.
Flat in nineteen of 1492 yeah everything.
Was a conspiracy at some point right.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah i mean like more like in modern.
Modern times where maybe someone was.
Like it became it was a known conspiracy.
And then either something came out or.
Someone proved it well this is what.
Happened just see small it right it was.
A conspiracy at first a lot of people.
Were saying what that doesn't sound.
Realistic that sounds like he staged it.
Mmm even before he the facts came out.
Right true people were saying that and.
Then you know a couple weeks later he.
Gets caught or they find like his i.
Don't know i don't know i don't know how.
It went down exactly but all these other.
Facts came out yeah and but it's like.
Those are like a small like a small.
Example of that i think you're talking.
About like a grand scale like worldwide.
Yeah or even something that is like what.
Government you know so they've been it's.
Like okay if it if it is like let's say.
Let's even say like god forbid i hope.
Not you know nick cannon whatever yeah.
They get they get him they get off on.
That would real quick they get him right.
And maybe even has like a note it says.
Like they came in bob i was a government.
Like then what do you do.
Did someone else call the police someone.
Else carries on.
Cuz they i think when nick cannon said.
It was like i'll take the baton from.
Here so it's almost as this like it's a.
Relay you know one person like you know.
I don't know i don't even know what i'm.
Trying to ask but it's like i know what.
You're saying what's the next like how.
Do you how do you find you'll see people.
Yeah pursue and make sure you know those.
People are you got it somebody you got.
To get somebody with in power yeah to be.
A conspiracy there is to be like to.
Pursue it yeah but also what person.
Morality yeah but the thing is it's like.
A you're basically in like a loophole.
Because that person loophole what is it.
Called where's the word i'm thinking oh.
Not conundrum either but basically that.
Person who makes it that way into power.
Your isn't gonna make it there without.
Playing ball yeah you know yeah so.
That's why i think those things never.
Come out yeah is even if somebody who if.
I all of a sudden i believe in.
Conspiracy theory is certain ones on all.
Of them if i were to somehow magically.
Make it into a position of power a.
President right i'm not gonna make it.
There by saying hey i wonder if the.
Clintons murdered something something.
They're not gonna let me rise into power.
With that kind of thinking i say so i.
Think it's there's no way really to.
Expose those kind of like no completely.
Innocent person can rise to that i'm.
Right amount of power and then they make.
A non in the way on the on the journey.
There they make you seem like a crazy.
Person already when you say conspiracy.
Theorist you're thinking all this guy.
Believes in flat earth or has nothing to.
Do yeah exactly.
But like aliens are we're not gonna get.
Into that but yeah aliens are not a.
Conspiracy alright are we going just.
Talk for derek i'm so excited i can't.
Wait to talk about all his alien stories.
That's pretty crazy how like you.
Literally it was like overnight that all.
These conspiracies like just exploded no.
No no it's been around for a while but.
The fact that he was pursuing this.
Documentary more people were like.
Exactly this is adding on to it oh yeah.
I think even more like suspect mostly i.
Think he could have easily just been.
Another shooting but like where normally.
When those happen like especially to.
Celebrities yeah if you find out oh they.
Caught the killer or they killed the kid.
Yeah i didn't.
Anything i think supposedly also it was.
Like on his turf in his area yeah you.
Know and how could people have done that.
And just gotten out you know that.
Quickly the turf was healing he he was.
In like i believe something something.
You know some i don't i don't know what.
It is it's i don't want to say anything.
I'm wrong but it was something.
Gang-related and then he also was.
Meeting with someone i think whoever.
That police officer whatever it is not.
The officer the guy you were talking.
About using the rolling sixties.
Neighborhood crips yeah well that is but.
He was supposed to meet with someone the.
Next day talk about preventing gang.
Violence yeah yeah so he was in a gang.
Right mmm that's it that's right right.
Yeah but yet he's trying to stop can be.
Trying to prevent people from going on.
The same yeah yeah yeah but i think a.
Lot of the times to uh originally gangs.
Were a way for like people who were in.
Like broken families and stuff and they.
Would have like like brother brotherly.
Ties or someone a father to look up to.
And everything like that it wasn't it.
Wasn't originally supposed to be about.
Like fighting and all that everything.
He's like right you know talking about.
Late in the 40s or the 50s.
We're like the the original purpose of.
The gang yeah i was supposed to be like.
That before.
Yeah and then it kind of just like.
Turned into something else.
Mmm right well i mean that that yeah.
Like i said i don't know enough about.
This like whole conspiracy i literally.
Just spent an hour before you guys came.
Over yeah i'm looking up stuff so i.
Don't want to spread misinformation and.
Also don't talk more because you might.
Die what oh yeah this oh that there's.
That too and like there's the fear of i.
Mean like people shedding light on the.
Fact that yeah even nick cannon the fact.
That we're talking about technically we.
Shouldn't be talking about it is what.
The messes are trying to say yeah in.
This conspiracy but so if we die.
Laughter.
Mysteriously yes i'm an idea of how do.
You think you're gonna die though right.
Yeah yeah like maybe you're gonna like.
Some people think like i'll do i just.
Know i'm gonna die in a car crash no i.
Don't i don't have one but some people.
Would think that they have a feeling no.
Walker.
To a forest put my hands up above my.
Head and dissolve and become a plant all.
Right that's how i'm gonna do it if.
You're gonna let me choose you know i'm.
Not letting you choose i just think how.
Do you think you're gonna die i think.
That's probably how would we ever never.
Want to be a plant no i mean i'm gonna.
Like into like the trees oh like ashes i.
Don't know either.
I've never sounds like a psychic how do.
You think you're going to die is.
Actually in this is in this 36 questions.
To love thing that i saw okay and it is.
Like it has a lot of different questions.
That eventually like get you and this.

My sleep are you gonna make me dissolve.
Our plants huh yeah that's true.
Seriously tell me how dark this went.
Dark but i like it because i like damn.

Even bad though they say that on tv you.
Know really yeah and    they say.
Bitchin i knows it yeah yeah they can oh.
She doesn't mean we should be just like.
You know she didn't she didn't ever.
Force the issue wait before we go to our.
See she break i think we should start.
Off with some twitter questions oh what.
We she see you then twitter questions.
After one because.
Let's do it before will loves to twitter.
Questions hey where are they underneath.
The nick cannon bart um not lamp higa.
Says favorite memory from childhood go.
Well actually the at is what reina erase.
Her favorite memory from childhood it's.
A very basic one well it kind of ties.
Into do we have memories from our.
Children oh no i don't know do you have.
One immediately that you can think of.
But favorite weird it's a but i don't.
Know if i said this on the bias but one.
Of my favorite memories is when i got.
Spanked by my dad what because i passed.
Another kid and i passed him and.
Remember like like i went to a private.
School i was like a christian school and.
My dad was a was a pastor what true.
Right so it was like oh why why am i.
Messing up so everything is like it.
Didn't look well mm-hmm and so my dad.
Spanked me but he used a racket paddle.
And not a normal racket paddle a wooden.
Racket palace know what racket paddles.
Are wooden know there's the string ones.
Although old school ones were wooden i.
Think you know i was like you know it's.
About three so why do you like what that.
You liked it no yes what you got you.
Into it's because oh he said after he.
Like spanked me so hard the first time.
They don't even pull the paddle back.
That my whole butt was red except for.
The little air holes so it is like.
There's little white spots on my butt.
From the rag and i just it's a funny.
Image i just think it's funny you saw it.
No but the way he said it is very like.
You can see it in your own head you know.
Huh like your whole blood is just red.
Except it looks like you have a reverse.
Chickenpox oh i thought you liked that.
For a different reason oh no it makes.
Sense where you're going to japan pretty.
Sure if i if after you got spanked i.
Went up to you and ask you like hey did.
You like that you perfect oh that's.
Definitely not definitely at the time.
But now it's kind of funny i've got so.
The conclusion that you're a masochist.
That's the one that likes pain right i.
Don't know i think a little bit but not.
I think a lot of it because for one.
Verbally you like to get abused and you.
Amuse yourself i do.
And.
And when it comes to comes to like the.
Shoots that we do like the other day we.
Did the the pulling the sheet thing.
Right yeah and then you're like out of.
Nowhere you just like hey what if i were.
To like ride into this table and fly off.
The bike and land like i like dude.
That's super dangerous so we're not.
Gonna do that but you really want to do.
It so you did i thought it'd be on your.
Own for your own video yeah and i.
Thought i thought i think oh and that's.
Just one of the fairies.
I don't you're a masochist the inside of.
My thigh mm-hmm yeah that's your fetish.
Huh i don't know maybe mmm you have a.
Favorite childhood memory no but i want.
To figure out more about paco favorite.
Childhood memory i don't know if i can i.
Mean it would take me a long time to.
Think of one specific one but probably.
Like sports like i did some baseball.
When i was really young i had like some.
Pretty good memories from and martial.
Arts doing martial arts growing up and.
Like going to tournaments and getting.
First place in those and it was just.
Really good memories i think from like.
You know feeling accomplished as a young.
Boy i was a very unhappy kid so i didn't.
Have a lot of good memories yeah at a.
Very it wasn't a rough childhood it was.
Just a very i was a very unhappy person.
Naturally you still are no i'm happy all.
The time for simple things you just.
Don't smile i guess not what about like.
Extracurricular stuff that made you made.
You happy like when i hated like most of.
My time was spent either studying doing.
Basketball judo which i hated both at.
The time i didn't like basketball back.
Then i never hit like a sweet little.
Jumper and never i never had many any.
Shots really i was like block i wasn't.
The worst guy on the team but i was.
Probably the second or third worse.
Mm-hmm yeah so it wasn't very happy.
You'd be like yeah that's not really.
Want to go to the next one though.
Because i got some sleeves to pull okay.
Not grab it's questionable thank you.
Raina next we got joe joe dick key dicky.
Thoughts and reusable straws oh do you.
Want to pull the sleeve sir so do you.
Want me you can go ahead.
Reusable straws i love reusable straws.
Oh really mr. using the straw right now.
That's not reusable.
That is reusable honestly yes it again.
Um the when i use some at home i'll.
Actually like clean these but i'm.
Talking like the metal ones yeah i.
Thought they were talking about like the.
Ones you recycle like the like the paper.
Ones you can talk about that those ones.
I do not agree i don't i know it's all.
About the environment and stuff like.
Straws can't do straws really make that.
Big of a difference like i know there's.
A lot of straws in the world yeah.
There's got to be other ways because.
Those straws are awful i think with the.
Straws thing supposedly it doesn't have.
That huge of an impact but it still has.
A little bit of an impact and also the.
Thing that it gets is the visual aid.
Because there is this one picture where.
This turtle had a huge like just a straw.
So yeah yeah i saw that and they're.
Trying to pull it out and there's like.
In his brain and all that stuff and.
First of all that drug should emit.
Snorting drugs that drug turtle.
It's a starting drug and your own joke.
Ruin my joke i'm not funny well i mean.
So that seems more like an emotional.
Reaction.
Yeah like a logical one because there's.
Other things you can like before straws.
I'm sure mmm i haven't done the research.
But i'm sure there's other things more.
You know yeah feasible or whatever it is.
To fix then straw straws can be like the.
Worst thing like why that and yet every.
Place in la is starting to do these.
Paper straws yeah and i hate him like i.
Get paid you get paper in your mouth i.
Think i thought okay thoughts on.
Reusable straws reusable straws are good.
Yes yes yeah agree agree i think you.
Should be using a reusable a lot of.
Things like i bring i don't use plastic.
Bags anymore like i bring my own bags.
How hard is it i reuse plastic bags yeah.
How hard is it to just use the same like.
Just get a bag and bring it same thing.
With straws how hard is it just to clean.
A straw and reuse it sort of you save.
Your plastic bags for the market i don't.
Even get plastic bags.
I bring i breathe you see i do know i.
Saw i go i think it's a asian thing yeah.
I say yeah yeah you guys do that growing.
Up make senior plastic bags from the.
Market and stuff because we do remember.
To layer our trash bag or our trash cans.
And stuff like that and just for a.
Random stuff i got scolded for using.
Straws from someone really recently.
Mm-hmm.
And it weird thing is a.
Girl that it was into and so i was like.
Just being like just trying to catch.
Conversation as soon as i use a straw.
She just got mad at me and i was like.
Well it's over good job.
That's all it takes huh yeah but even.
These straws you can clean these i mean.
I know it sounds kind of wack but you.
Can actually wash these and clean it no.
It's super easy this is actually a topic.
That i was gonna bring up for notes was.
Recycling and apparently you're gonna.
Bring up recycling yeah because the.
Thing is a lot of people think that it.
Could be too late for recycling that you.
Know we're killing the earth and it's.
It's too late for the stuff like that.
Because before china actually we.
Exported a lot of our recycling and our.
Waste to china because they're such.
Their cheap labor laws they were able to.
Take these things recycle the trillions.
Of products but china i think within the.
Past couple years something banned.
Importing of like loathsome waste so now.
Cities that used to make like i think.
Like sixty something million dollars a a.
Per ton for recycling mm-hmm.
Now have to pay like to get their.
Recycling done a lot of these places are.
Burning their recycling their waste for.
Energy but it's just like so what does.
Our i guess country do now in terms of.
Recycling because it takes so much for.
Them to sort through all these like.
Small things right so what we could do.
Individually is to separate them but i.
Feel like it's because america feels so.
Entitled a lot of us are just gonna be.
Like why do i need to do that you know.
I'm already helping by recycling why do.
I need to take these other steps no.
One's going to yeah i mean some people.
Were obviously but the majority is not.
Going unless it becomes a cool thing to.
Do or gonna make it cool yeah or it has.
To become a i mean like high five.
Yeah well california already has that.
Though what's worthy yeah you get paid.
To recycle you get five cents back i.
Think california has ten cents right we.
Had i don't remember what it's not that.
You know no we still i mean i still.
Collect all bottles and stuff like that.
But yeah we do get we'd get no rewards.
Here so i don't see why people are.
Incentivized here to do it mm-hmm most.
People don't i see a lot i drove around.
The neighborhood and stuff i don't see.
Many her cycle like recycling things i.
See.
Of trash cans it's more work for people.
One of the things that ladies in my own.
Personal opinion is like it's it's it's.
Good to recycle but it's also like a.
Good thing to be conscious of like how.
Much trash you're actually using like in.
General like that's why i think we.
Started trying to like use a lot of.
Reusable stuff you know and like i know.
It sounds kind of hipster but you like.
Put something like instead of using.
Things you know bring a jar and like.
Fill whatever you're getting like rice.
Like when we go get rice like we put it.
In like a reasonable bag or a jar so.
We're not very good about the boxes and.
Then you use it any throw away the box.
Wherever you know what i mean like just.
Like a thing in the back of my mind i.
Think that yeah that wasn't always like.
That it was only like as i became an.
Adult so yeah but that's my two cents on.
It well overall recycling is good more.
People should do it what's unreasonable.
Straw is good yeah.
Shishi break i'm not a fan of still not.
Found a paper straws still not a fan you.
Know they used to be made of corn i well.
You told me that yeah why don't they do.
That sounds like it's probably a.
Conspiracy a conspiracy crosstalk.
Warning idea she should break already.
Music.
Classy and tried to take it and we're.
Back in our pack okay and we're back.
Welcome back to the second half of the.
Box take it out of the    oh my gosh.
It's so loud whoa what am i drinking out.
Of it's my brand-new off-the-field.
Podcast mug get it at weekend they know.
I think so i think people ask if they.
Can get it uncle look get it somewhere.
Well i thought wearing off the pill.
Shirt too but yeah no sponsorship plug.
And you snap and then put cgi over yeah.
Yeah cgi right hit the mugs good see we.
Already knocked out all the twitter.
Questions now we have them are yeah well.
Okay what is this one i won't skip it's.
My favorite.
Tata says out of the videos you guys.
Created which one of them took the most.
Time in hawaii oh that's just a question.
For everyone the most i don't recall.
I don't recall a most time time and why.
Like everything start to finish start.
You writing to when it's posted yes i.
Don't know you would know that yeah i.
Know i think i mean some videos it's.
Something i wrote like the year before.
Does that count sound like i'm actively.
Working on it though yeah be like from.
When he pulled it up finalized it and.
Then got it into our hands and then you.
Know gets edit it didn't post it.
Honestly probably one of the bga videos.
Those take the longest oh yeah i didn't.
Think of that because because your.
Prosthetics pardon it that's why it i.
Mean people will ask for anything i want.
You guys make another one it something.
Like just like 10 minutes it's not ten.
Minutes because the videos ten minutes.
Does not mean it takes ten minutes to.
Six ten months so those are what i don't.
Know about that but i'll usually write a.
Concept first i need to have a good idea.
For a song and i don't have to think can.
This song fit into where the storyline.
Is where all the guys you know but it's.
But then there's another step which is.
Even harder which is from there if i.
Have a concept i work with david to be.
Like hey can you translate this to.
Korean because you need to have korean.
In it right yeah okay pop so there's.
That step which is painful because we.
Have to find words that i can't even.
Contribute i don't know how to make.
Something sound good.
Syllable wise i'm wise cuz i don't know.
You know green yeah so there's that step.
And then after that we have to make the.
Song and i have to learn and the other.
Guys if they're in it have to learn how.
To say these words and not even words.
We're saying sounds basically imitating.
What we're being told it's really hard.
Yeah it's it's just like a and just make.
A song the subtitles take over at that.
Point that's to make this song and then.
We had to go through all the other stuff.
To make the video it's ridiculous and.
The music video is more of like a.
Traditional sense of filming a video.
Like oh there's a budget involved it's a.
Budget there's a crew like out here we.
Do it very like youtube style right we.
Have like quick quick fast out there.
It's like setup to the scene you have a.
Call sign shot that the proper film yeah.
Yeah and it's it takes way longer it's.
Way more expensive.
And so you know what if you guys want a.
Bga video patreon right here i'm.
Thirteen million dollars if you don't.
Raise thirteen million dollars by 24.
Hours of when this podcast released just.
Can't have it honestly though like.
That's part of the reason why i don't do.
It it's like financially not like those.
Videos do well but i don't really like.
Really benefit from it that much in.
Terms of like financial i like to lose.
Money i think i'm the first one you know.
It's you don't because they're not.
Sponsored if they were sponsored then.
You could get you know it would be worth.
Doing but timewise and like money-wise.
It's expensive yeah out of my pocket -.
I'm not like yeah and the guys are not.
I'm not paying them they're just doing.
Me a favor yeah i being in it dude.
You're paying them an exposure sure but.
I don't really count that i would love.
To pay them i just don't have the budget.
Yeah it all goes towards making the.
Music video yep one of those those are.
The ones that take the longest and.
That's why i don't know but with you.
Guys i don't know i mean what what's it.
Your turn.
What do i say i don't know i mean i mean.
That's that's the one but for you.
Personally like your experience what is.
The longest one for you i guess the one.
That i made out of the videos i created.
Like which one took the longest for you.
To like partake in is actually probably.
Might've been this the ghost-hunting one.
Cuz you were the only editor really no.
I'd switched over to greg oh a large.
Chunk of it yeah i mean that took a long.
Time but that wouldn't be one that i.
Look back you're like wow that was just.
Took us such a long time i mean we had.
Like a an unfortunate loss of progress.
During the process but that that's i.
Don't really i mean yeah i don't know i.
Can't really think i mean that has to be.
Pretty much the one that is answered.
Because mine is my experience is.
Different in terms of like i can't think.
Of like a first channel one i can't i.
Guess i mean i guess the obvious one.
Will be dragonball i mean that was a.
Long time ago it took a long time or any.
Of those big effects for yes you know.
Those want to take a long time cuz i.
Mean yeah people don't know we don't.
Know how long it takes.
Yeah it's okay it doesn't matter all we.
Do is make podcast now anyway i think.
One comment that annoys me the most is.
Like just ryan can't you make more.
Videos i could i definitely could i.
Could post three times a day but it.
I bet you i could i would shoot i'll.
Steal them right now in two hours but to.
Where you watch it if you watch it sure.
I'll make i'll make ten videos a day.
Yeah that's easy but we'll watch it but.
That's not the type of content you come.
To him for as well it's well i mean some.
People like that stuff but like it's.
Just not what i am i like doing for one.
Yeah yeah to the super employee board.
You know thank you.
Tata nine nine three zero nine one nine.
Shouting yeah thanks for the question.
Anyway that was yeah we got some.
Twitter's out of the way we don't.
Anymore about whatever we know enough.
Twitter question okay we can do more.
Next time it's just that we can all have.
Very similar ones you know yeah but yeah.
Be original damn dude i mean you know.
What we should do which is fun we should.
Just pull like what we do for you - why.
Don't we just pull from the comments.
Section dear ryan there's so many yes.
Good i saw good questions every time i.
Walk back to podcast there's way better.
Questions in the in the comments section.
I like what a bunch just go look it up.
So right now there's we change it for.
The next one if you guys leave if you.
Guys have interesting stuff that's you.
Know i think the thing i like about it.
Is people can upload it yeah you have.
Good questions that people care about.
Versus like not no offense to be with.
Left those twitter questions is just a.
Lot of times are very like stuff we've.
Already answered also we only had two.
Hours for this one cuz we didn't really.
Give time yeah yeah so was leaving you.
Were questions you were questions yeah.
Because uh i mean i think i like the.
Youtube system i think it's in terms of.
Like the uploading system at least it.
Shows like what people care about yeah.
So leave some interesting stuff up both.
The ones you like just like a dear ryan.
I like that yeah dude okay this is weird.
But vancouver and toronto got some hot.
Girls i know you guys are taking but.
They got i mean doesn't mean we can't.
Acknowledge that i mean your type though.
I don't can i talk about your type real.
This i do why no because it's really.
Interesting to me and maybe other people.
Share the same thing it's not a bad.
Thing it's just like roasting well how.
Does that mean roaster are you beat cuz.
See.
Means you think think of it as an insult.
Then well no cuz every time you you find.
One way to because it's so interesting.

Breakable i've been with the girls who.
Weren't break but i mean that that just.
Gives you a picture in your arm yeah.

Your arm.
I just find it so interesting it's just.
Very interesting to it is i've never.
I've never heard of that like that's.
Your interest what that is so specific.
That's why cuz i say a lot of things.
That other guys would say but then that.
We different like nobody can it can also.
Display like you can imagine a whole.
Person just based off of that one thing.
Off their arm yeah i accept this.
Challenge we got to find those pictures.

Long time i know are a lot of i still.

I know i'm not tall but i don't really.
Like when the girls taller no most guys.
Are like that most guys don't want to do.
It like a whole like oh you want to feel.
Effeminate like is it it must be.
Something to have something to do you.

Dude it's so you guys let's talk about.
That a little bit you guys have been to.
Japan oh yeah yeah yeah and i was i'm.
Jealous because i haven't been on any.
Trips we went on the book to her but.
That was just me and ryan and that was.
Yeah that was really fun for me.
Japan was by far our favorite trip for.
Sure he got super hooked up yeah shout.
Out to ben grubbs was working at youtube.
So there is this thing called geek week.
Right and essentially i do i just didn't.
Want to go because i was like i need to.
Make videos and like what if we what if.
We give you a budget fly all your all.
Your team.
You know essentially we'll make you a.
Video so you not to worry about that but.
You basically had a one week vacation in.
Japan yeah and then you promote it on.
Geek week and promote on geek week so it.
Was like a win-win you know you get a.
Vacation and you get a video usually.
What stops me from going places i need.
To work on something yeah so we did that.
And youtube google they have so much.
Money they put us in the ritz like the.
Nice one of the nicest hotels in tokyo.
Ritz carlton in in tokyo in roppongi.
It's like the business district very.
Fancy super nice i think that's a gaijin.
Hunter and there was um what does that.
Mean it's like we're the japanese girls.
Look for a white guy foreigners type of.
Thing i didn't know it looked like super.
Like it looked like businessmen area.
Yeah yeah super nice and definitely.
Expensive not that we'd had to pay for.
It yeah but they gave me will sean and.
Greg just four of us yes we all had our.
Own suite about the size of like so.
Pointless suite had two beds yeah.
It was so pointless but it was like the.
Best like it's hard to beat when you're.
Four you guys even said that you ended.
Up sleeping in each other's really i.
Don't think i slept in mind maybe yeah i.
Think we gave was that the we gave like.
It let someone sleep in ours or.
Something but yeah i don't think it was.
Too big there's too much room and and it.
Was together anyway and had chocolates.
Where you guys every night every morning.
We had you chocolate spray but to be.
Fair on the trip there was a lot of work.
Yeah like we were working the majority.
Of the time we're filming we're like.
Going to locations yeah and you guys are.
Doing the nada to a video i don't know.
Yeah yeah official fake no to video and.
Then the we did some meeting read stuff.
Like that yeah but um yeah that was.
Interesting i was it was for sure a good.
Trip best trip and you guys did an onsen.
Yeah that's what i was saying we're.
Jealous i wasn't being sarcastic we're.
Jealous that you're going to japan i.
Love japan yeah cuz we had such a but.
It's such a um such an interesting place.
It's the only time i went on a trip.
Somewhere where i felt like this is.
Actually like a completely different.
Country because no one understands you.
Yeah like in singapore people still.
Speak english.
Hong kong actually no i take that back.
We went that mean changing that wasn't a.
Good experience i had a horrible thing.
That felt the same more like no one.
Really yeah.
Taxi drivers trying to scam me and.
Derrick the whole time they're trying to.
Overcharge us like double and we.
Couldn't get anywhere and the people who.
Brought us out kind of weird like.
Stranded they just rotting like you know.
We had no idea children working we.
Couldn't find a hotel like it was fun so.
In japan i would say go to an onsen.
Preferably one that you actually have to.
Take your clothes off and sit and tell.
People what i wants it is it's like a.
Bath house or like a spa break it's like.
A spa place yeah yeah and now dude i.
Honestly want to go to one where it's.
Like old ladies yeah that's what we went.
That's what i want to do and also go to.
Ski g fish market.
No that clothes i thought they had they.
Moved locations or something yeah well.
Go to wherever like wake up super early.
Or stay up all the way to like 4 or 5.
And come and try and do that i'm gonna.
Try to do the the mati carts which is.
The mario oh yeah i'm gonna try and do.
That there's like he's a kaia they have.
A so we didn't go in there yeah but they.
Have some weird stuff in jet in japan oh.
Yeah for sure these people and i think.
What i can say because i haven't you out.
There they're weird dude they're weird.
They do some weird stuff mm-hmm but it's.
At the same time they're like the nicest.
People like go never meet any more.
Polite have better service and in japan.
To me i don't know just my opinion but.
They do some weird stuff like his.
Process club that we went to remember.
There was this place called black rose.
Yep and it's a s&m bar you know what.
That is yeah yeah like would be nice.
They do that and they do like whatnot.
That we did it was closed so i don't.
Know if you did you ever tell this story.
I don't know but we were with like the.
Person who was taking us around i like.
You were just trying to show us like.
Weird stuff weird stuff fun time and we.
Went up to this bar and just you and him.
Just me and him and we was elevator the.
Elevator opens up and you step right.
Into the bar and it was red velvet all.
Over the walls and can't melted candles.
Everywhere i was like black furniture.
And we.
Walking was completely empty and i was.
Like do you think we should go in here.
Like what's gonna happen we walked to.
The end of the bar he just like like.
Walks in dude to do like american guy.
Hey everybody here and i was just like.
Um i think they're close and he's like.
Yeah i guess their clothes and they just.
Laugh but i came down i was like kind of.
Scared like that terrifying it creeped.
Me out.
Yeah but i'm pretty sure if that bar.
Would have been open we would have had a.
Different experience oh for sure that's.
What i mean though i think that's the.
Kind of stuff that you would do yeah i.
Probably do some ways though like that.
Yeah yeah i think there's a good amount.
Of them they're pretty excited for you.
Mr. ainge better bring back some good.
Stories for this podcast and then film.
It yeah i actually wanna try and do like.
Uh i was really inspired cuz i just saw.
The conan yeah it out without borders.
Something that dude he's hilarious man.
So funny like i'm inspired i want to do.
Something like this right things don't.
You feel like only he can get over sure.
He says some things and he like the way.
He's so charismatic that he's able to.
Act a certain way when people will laugh.
Yeah you did it.
You'd be like your comments would just.
Be the opposite you know i mean maybe.
Well that's why you being a comedian is.
About being self-aware you know and just.
Like understanding how people perceive.
You yeah so i i mean like it shouldn't.
Change but he what's being said is still.
The same thing like he says some things.
And he does some things that i feel like.
If logan paul did it oh for sure exactly.
The same as sure he would receive the.
Exact opposite response.
Hmm but it's just based on likability.
How are we going in on this part about.
What is it is time what i mean just.
Extending that conversation because.
That's a conversation in itself is it.
How like people's actions yeah aren't.
The same just because of who they are.
Yeah of course you know i mean it's not.
Necessarily fair but i think it is is it.
Fair i do think it is so you think it's.
Fair like jesse smollett is famous so.
He's able to get out of a crime that he.
Committed no i don't really no no no.
There's no way i thought of it because.
That's i just saw a video today yeah.
That he's not getting talked about that.
What a chicago police department was.
Basically saying like it's the reason.
Why.
He's getting away with this it shows.
That yeah if you're famous we have money.
You can get away with things yeah and.
That's what i mean in like not people.
Aren't treated the same you see who they.
Are and i i mean i don't think that's.
Fair yeah.
Well what i'm talking about is like the.
Whole likability thing if you've built a.
Foundation and a character behind you.
Sure that shows that you know i you have.
A positive attitude and you're trying to.
Do things for the better that you know.
Certain things that you do he would.
Should have an understanding of okay.
There's a reason behind this it's not.
Purely for what he's just saying i think.
It's very important to yeah build a.
Foundation and context just like the.
Ryan higa foundation giving back to the.
