Hey guys so most of you guys know by now.
But i'm never on time for trying clearly.
As you could probably read the title but.
This time i feel like we were way ahead.
Of the game like years ago if you guys.
Watch our identity series you guys know.
What i'm talking about okay yeah it's.
Not quite the exact trend because you.
Know we didn't actually hammer it and.
Polish it but i'm japanese so that's.
Like half the trend you know anyway for.
Those of you that don't know what i'm.
Talking about this trend is called the.
Japanese air polish tinfoil ball or.
Something like that it's basically just.
Taking a bunch of foil and making a foil.
Ball and feeding it up until it becomes.
Shiny and spherical sphere sphere.
Fiera cool but for the majority of you.
You probably already have seen this.
Trend done like a thousand times i mean.
Just searching foil on youtube you see.
Tons of these videos just like.
Everywhere a lot of them kind of click.
Beatty i mean it can't all be the.
Largest world breaking ball in the world.
I mean i'm not trying to throw straight.
You guys seen the thumbnail have like a.
Perfectly shiny ball on the thumbnail.
That looks like perfectly round and it's.
Mirror polish to the point that it is a.
Mirror then you watch the video in the.
End product is nothing like that i mean.
If i'm not mistaken that's what.
Clickbait is right you mean like what.
You're doing right now what the ultimate.
Foil ball sounds pretty click baby to me.
Wait how did you know i was gonna name.
It that it's right there and seriously.
That thumbnail you're gonna make a foil.
Ball that's the size of a person that's.
Definitely click big what what's so hard.
About it is you just make a ball out of.
Tinfoil right i do that every single.
Time i have leftover see anyone can make.
An ordinary ball out of tinfoil to.
Create a perfect mirror polished.
Japanese tin foil ball one must hold the.
Pasta tin foil ball okay honestly how.
Hard could that possibly be.
Yeah no i didn't even start it yet i.
Didn't really feel like doing it so i.
Kind of just been sitting here for a.
Week i'll probably get started in like.
An hour or two so.
Music.
Laughter.
Music.
Open up a ball before you take a hammer.
To until it's fall.
Wrap it up again and again and now you.
Got yourself a gold ball basically.
That's always to when you idiot to get.
This wrong don't know what else i can.
Say i didn't even need to make this song.
Mr. zall my.
Music.
To go away.
The cost like a big break when they're.
Working.
Oh hey guys i'm finished with the song.
Now and now presenting the ultimate foil.
Ball i knew you were gonna make one as.
Big as the one in the thumbnail but come.
On that was just sad oh this no this is.
Just for the swish to open the curtain.
For the real foil ball what do you.
Really need that ball for that switch.
And is that even a real lever yeah look.
Guys.
Music.
Music.
Really it's the green ball no that.
That's all foil when you compress tin.
Foil enough it kind of loses its.
Shininess and what happens is this green.
Tint well it's the green ball okay fine.
I wrap the green ball in foil but this.
This is real this is a lot of wheat i.
Know you could make one as big as the.
Thumbnail without baking it's not fake.
Then where is it huh where is this.
Ultimate tin foil ball right here i just.
Told you that is not ultimate that isn't.
Even close to the size of the one in the.
Thumbnail okay.
What are you trying to say that i'm.
Trying to say that your title is.
Misleading and not only is your.
Thumbnail fake it's a straight-up eye so.
You know what that makes you a cheesy.
Clickbait er see i know you're gonna.
Make one it makes the thumbnail without.
Making it it's not fake.
Well except for this one but the next.
Part coming up that's all real.
Music.
Music.
Music.
See pretty good thumbnail hi i told you.
It wasn't fake but the title was still.
Misleading come on fine i'll admit it i.
Was wrong i know yes she made a real.
Ball even though it isn't as big as i.
Thought it would be and the contraption.
Was pretty cool so so what are you.
Trying to say this video wasn't.
Clickbait that's what i've been trying.
To tell you from the start.
See doesn't it feel nice to know that.
See cuz when you compress tinfoil.
