Hey guys so today i'm gonna be talking.
About the most annoying types of friends.
And i know that sounds really bad.
Because you aren't calling your friends.
Annoying let's be real for a second.
Every single friend of yours probably.
Does at least one thing that annoys you.
But you just look past it because well.
If they're your friend either that or.
You haven't been friends long enough to.
See those traits come out or well you.
Don't have any friends you would know a.
Lot about that huh.
What you act like you have friends what.
Are you talking about i have friends.
Yeah and that's why you're talking to me.
Right now you talked to me first that's.
Why i'm talking to you yeah but.
Technically i am you so you talked to.
You first why are you here i'm annoying.
Right and i'm here to help you with this.
Video since you have no friends yeah but.
You only have season two look if you're.
Gonna help can you at least wait till we.
Get to the examples i'm sorry i thought.
We already started is this not the first.
Example is it's not the whiny annoying.
Vlogger friend anyway as i was saying.
Until i still rudely interrupted myself.
I love my friends i'm sure you guys love.
All of yours that's why we call them.
Friends but there's no such thing as a.
Friend that's never annoying there's.
Just friends that are significantly less.
Annoying than others and today we're.
Gonna be talking about those others here.
Are the most annoying types of friends.
Take a look.
This is one of the most relatable common.
Ones there is the baler we all have that.
One friend who says they're always down.
To do stuff and then they make plans.
With you and at the very last second.
They tell you that they can't go or they.
Bail hence the baler hey greg do you.
Want to go to the gym a little bit yeah.
Let me just get ready all right i'm good.
You ready oh my bad dude i i can't go.
Anymore i can't make you have a doctor's.
Thing appointment conference the judger.
Just like it says in title this is the.
Friend that literally judges you for.
Everything that you do i see you and me.
Like seriously you're gonna wear that on.
A date what's wrong with it i mean it's.
Cool i mean it looks a little.
Polka-dotty though you shouldn't have be.
Heating those those are so bad for you.
Wait are you liking her photo you just.
Met her that's so desperate the.
Passive-aggressive friend this is one of.
The most annoying types of friends in my.
Opinion they never ever tell you exactly.
What they want to say or what they want.
To do it just hint at it so that you.
Don't believe the bad guy and they put.
It on you all right so who's driving i.
Can't cuz my car's in the shop so i can.
I can i i did drink a little so i mean.
Like if you don't mind riding a little.
Bit drunk it's fine oh i do have shoe.
Boxes in the back that's kind of taking.
Up some space so they'd probably be.
Really uncomfortable for three people.
But it's cool because i can just throw.
My shoes on in the trash i don't need.
Them i mean i don't need shoes i cannot.
Have this as lepers even though it's.
Really not safe for my workplace you.
Know as long as you just don't block my.
Rearview mirror because you know i can't.
See at night and i can't drive.
Oh it's dave i can't see during the day.
Very well okay fine i'll try to i can.
Drive no it's it's fine i mean i can.
Drive as long as you drive okay let's.
Just go sure if that's what you want to.
Do the liger again another common one i.
Mean these friends pretty much speak a.
Different language when it comes to time.
Just have to translate it for example.
Agar says that they're leaving soon it.
Means they haven't even started to get.
Rid of it when they say they're on my.
Way that means i'm on my way to get.
Ready but i'm still 30 minutes from.
Leaving when they say i'm here that.
Means they're five to ten minutes away.
And then when the liger says i can't.
Seem to find you where are you that.
Means they literally just showed up at.
That second the overly sensitive friend.
This is the friend that takes every.
Little thing so personally that you get.
To the point where you have to be.
Careful what you say around them and.
What you do around them because you.
Don't want to offend them oh wow what.
Eft itf ti thanks for the invite oh i.
Mean i was already with derek and we.
Just.
By this great food place oh so you guys.
Were already hanging out without me.
That's cool now you don't mean my green.
Why because i'm asian so i only asian.
Food what amazing - wow so you're saying.
I'm unoriginal i didn't say that are you.
Calling me alive okay it's not a big.
Deal we'll just strive back to the same.
Greek food place at the same exact meal.
So you don't feel left out okay no i'm.
Good what what else do you want just.
Don't want to go why artie the ditcher.
When a hot girl or a guy comes along.
This is the friend that just changes.
After them they disappear and completely.
Seem to forget about you and your.
Friends the photographer i guess this.
One isn't really annoying to a lot of.
You guys but this is really annoying to.
Me this is the person that has to take a.
Picture of every single little thing.
That you and your friends do to them.
Then needs to be broadcasted or it.
Didn't happen the cheap friend this is.
The one friend in the group that never.
Pays for anything okay i'll be right.
Back i got a all right and your friend.
Over there said you guys are paying.
Together the overly competitive friend.
This is the rent you never want to play.
Games with because they always get way.
Too competitive oh you just hit it just.
Hit the ball like are you serious no.
Let's go i mean like if you want to.
Handicap you can get help take it easy.
Man it's cool it's your turn go ahead.
Just go ahead you need the help so i.
Hope you need to play by the rules even.
By your own your dumbass roses fine the.
Check out this video friend i need a.
Better title for though this is the one.
Friend that always wants to show you a.
Video that he or she thinks is so funny.
Or cool or awesome even though they're.
Not that funny or cool or awesome you.
See that twist so good right right right.
Right.
The overly honest friend and last but.
Not least you never want a lying friend.
That's like one of the top things you.
Don't want in a friend but sometimes the.
Overly honest friend can actually be a.
Lot more annoying for example see that.
Twist so good right right right right.
This video sucked oh because sometimes.
It's better to lie to a friend than to.
Actually hurt them this video sucked oh.
But i guess there's a good ending to it.
And it doesn't end awkwardly and again i.
Didn't make this video to call friends.
Of mine nor do i think you should send.
This to your annoying friends because.
That'll probably result in you know you.
Having less friends it's actually the.
Opposite when i made this list i.
Actually realized that i do a lot of.
These annoying trees i mean when you.
Watch this video i'm sure you guys.
Pinpoint in which one of your friends is.
This and which one of your friends is.
That but sometimes we forget to look at.
Ourselves you haven't already you should.
Rewatch this video and instead of.
Thinking about all your different.
Friends that these apply to think about.
Yourselves if there's something a friend.
Does that really annoys you chances are.
You do something that really annoys that.
Friend as well because there's no such.
Thing as a perfect friend which also.
Means that you're not the perfect friend.
Either in order to preserve that.
Friendship we have to learn to just.
Accept these annoying traits and realize.
That no friend yeah how would you know.
You have no friends i have friends okay.
Just because i'm talking to an annoying.
Imaginary one it doesn't cause i'm not.
Imaginary what you still don't get it.
Get what you see how annoying i am too.
Yes you aren't incredibly annoying she's.
Why you named me annoying wrong i didn't.
Call you that you called yourself that.
Exactly i called myself that and i am.
You.
I'm gonna knowing all along you see that.
Twist so good right right right right.
This video sucked oh but i guess there's.
A good ending to it and says intend.
Awkwardly that's really bad for you.
Right.
Music.
