Caught oh is there a way there is no any.
Nice crunch.
No anyway you would have to like like.
Suck on the chip for a long time no but.
Even opening the bag oh yeah you can't.
Do that everyone had that scene in big.
Daddy mm-hmm and when he's like trying.
To eat um well that's he trying to eat i.
Don't know some kind of chips but that's.
Such a relatable thing you can't open a.
Bag of chips without making a lot of.
Noise yeah whenever i do that instantly.
Wherever i am in the house dogs every.
Single time i remember in school.
Whenever i had to open up a bag of chips.
I'd always just be like i'd have to.
Cough yeah because it was loud you know.
So it gregg does with farting and farts.
At the same time huh yeah he does holes.
Yeah well he coughs loudly so you don't.
Hear his fart yeah but you can clearly.
Hear his part and a burp is like it's.
Extra long wait what do you mean.
Sometimes he'll do the burt burt the.
Barb the barb the but that's a good name.
For it the barb the burp i was other one.
Cough combo that is that's a lot yeah.
Just died a lot of emotions going on.
Ones i've definitely farted and sneeze.
At the same time i once threw up and.
Diarrhea at myself at the same time ha.
So where did it go.
Yes because when i was a kid you know i.
Had the flu.
Uh-huh and so i just like spread my legs.
Open over the toilet and just like try.
The puke through the hole didn't it yeah.
I definitely got all over me oh yeah oh.
Yeah well that's just unfortunate where.
Else actually where else is gonna go.
Unless you have a trash can next to you.
So what about you dana since we have a.
Girl in the room today and we're.
Starting off with very hot oh how should.
I say manly topics is that sexist to say.
No most girls don't let's see not that.
Easy huh yeah how about what this what.
Are your thoughts on girls are like.
Girls no boop well i mean that's i don't.
Know i don't think that's a know that it.
Is girl i mean it's a joke yeah it is.
But a lot of girls like don't you talk.
About they're poop-shaped.
Yeah those are poop shamed i agree yeah.
But you agreed that girls don't poop are.
You agree that it's a common joke yeah i.
Think but i think some girls take it too.
Far you know where they're actually like.
I don't want to talk about this great i.
Don't poop you know we should start it.
Your movement i mean i there was that.
Video i gave you about how girls should.
Be like allowed to fart hashtag me poop.
Yeah and then bite what you're gonna get.
You're gonna get you for that bob no i.
Mean like dana's pretty as much as deena.
Is cuz you're always you're the only.
Girl in or hpc and you're around guys.
All the time farting and burping and and.
You're pretty open to it like you don't.
Think it's i mean whether you do or not.
You're just around it right yeah yeah.
You have a choice but even before rhpc.
She's kind of been around all guys just.
The dance crew all steph boys like i was.
Always around like 15 to 17 guys all the.
Time so maybe i'm immune to it because.
I'm maybe i guess oh no but you grew up.
With all i mean not grew up but like all.
Your friend group was mostly guys um and.
Then now with rhpc you're surrounded by.
Guys all the time who are pretty gross i.
Would say i mean in compared to the.
Average yeah person i think very open.
With farting and some but like being the.
Only girl you don't really like when.
That stuff happens it's not.
You go ill or like you're just so immune.
To it but you yourself don't do it yet.
So i think that's what we're talking.
About like how it's not okay for girls.
To express themselves that way i think.
With us it's okay.
What do you mean like with us like many.
Girls did that we'd be like no he's like.
We would kind of encourage it yeah well.
Yeah i'd be like cuz it's you it's.
Different yeah would you do it with me.
Do what fart if you farted yeah i think.
We would be all laughing we'd be like i.
Think we'd be grossed out i think we.
Need like yeah i think it depends on.
Your friend group i don't know okay so i.
Permission so if that happens actually.
We encourage it not just permission we.
Want you to fire in front of us.
Yeah actually have you ever have you.
Heard ardan fart yes does she fart on.
You ha no i i mean i don't do you do.
That like the people we don't really do.
That yeah dude.
Really yeah mm no she hasn't done that.
No yes arned i heard i've heard it and.
She was extremely embarrassed how about.
Now.
What if she farts she still is yes no.
She still is embarrassed but like i mean.
I don't see why like i've heard her poop.
Before i've heard i've heard some salvos.
I'm sure greg actually has greg hurt i'm.
Sure he's heard you fought oh yeah do.
You do it like no not on right so i.
Think similar to that cuz you i mean you.
Guys are basically like how long have.
You and greg been together it'll be.
Maybe 15 years holy moly older than a.
Lot of that's like people watching yeah.
More than half our life they've been.
Together since high school right yeah.
Lasted my last year of high school right.
That is uh you're basically married in.
Some states i think yeah common law.
Common law.
Well um speaking of greg what is it like.
Living with greg that's a common thing.
That i mean not just i mean we don't.
Even know yeah oh yeah i mean you kind.
Of know you lived it.
Yeah but i mean like the it's it's an.
Interesting relationship cuz you guys.
Have been together so long you live.
Together but you also work together a.
Lot uh-huh we do everything together.
It's good it's tricky but do you ever.
Get like man i just need my own space.
Oh all the time does he that's yeah well.
That's why their house has like five.
Different rooms yeah yeah we each have.
Our own offices for when yep those times.
Happen because they do yeah i think what.
Helps is that like early on in our.
Relationship too after a few years of.
Dating we were like co partnering a damn.
Studio we had the dance crew so we were.
Both kind of like in the creative.
Director position so we always worked.
Together and then we both taught.
Multiple dance classes together and i.
Feel like it we kind of got used to.
Doing everything together so we.
Understand each other's chemistry and.
How we work right but with this line.
It's like with what we're doing now with.
Working with you and stuff it gets a.
Little tricky knowing the fact that it's.
Kind of like unpredictable of what you.
Throw at us basically and since we both.
Have different strengths and visions.
That we could either show off we do tend.
To bump heads a lot creatively and that.
Kind of affects the relationship because.
If you have a tricky day where you want.
Something to happen your way and you.
Know he thinks otherwise.
Before compromising it's like you can't.
Go home and complain you're like let.
Yeah stress out on your boyfriend who.
Caused you the stress to begin with so.
We don't have that but we do understand.
That okay.
We're compromising a little bit more.
Efficiently now where we both kind of.
Understand how to work around each other.
And our visions but it's tricky but also.
Rewarding because it's when you know.
When we come out with something that's.
Really cool that we both were a part of.
We could say that we also did this while.
In a relationship or it's something that.
We created together and that yeah that's.
Awesome i was wondering about that.
Because it's got to be like for you i.
Feel like it's tough because or maybe.
Weak there's a side that we don't.
See but you're the temp person that i've.
Never once heard you mad really actually.
I think a little annoyed but i've never.
Heard you complain or mad like i don't.
Know if you have no no i've never seen.
Her greg get mad at her actually but.
I've never seen like maybe when you guys.
Are home do you ever get like and show.
That i'm sure you have to write every.
Normal person does that otherwise you're.
A social path you know but you've never.
When we're around you've never done that.
Yeah no i think it's hard did how do i.
Say this when i'm around you guys it's.
Like it's always a like a positive.
Environment so it's kind of hard if.
Something frustrates me like i won't let.
It get to me right um i think a lot of.
The time too is because your frustration.
Will probably happen before we even get.
Together because you're designing props.
And you're designing costumes and you're.
Designing sets and that's something not.
Necessarily we're around and then as.
Soon as you're done being stressed out.
That's when we all meet up and then.
You're like i have nothing to be upset.
About i've seen like moments were like.
You know if i mean even if it is a.
Positive environment i mean there's it's.
Stressful situations we're running out.
Of sunlight or if like we've got to film.
Something in a limited amount of time.
We're not moving fast enough you know.
Like there's there's definitely times.
Where everybody gets frustrated and i've.
Seen greg get frustrated stressed and.
You guys kind of whether it's like.
Something you disagree on and greg get a.
Little upset but you won't you just kind.
Of go with the flow okay like very.
Passive mmm-hmm i think oh yeah when he.
Kind of gets in that position i know to.
Just kind of follow his word because i.
Trust that you know i don't i don't want.
To confront him in that time or i think.
He kind of gets into a director mode so.
I'm like okay let me do this for you.
Because i think at that time when were.
Filming and it something like that.
Happens i just kind of trust him or i.
Just trust and that he knows what he's.
Gonna be doing and i'll help support.
That because sometimes he'll be kind of.
In a panic or trying to figure out what.
He needs.
You are kind of overwhelmed so then.
That's when i become like what can i do.
For you type thing because i know that.
You know if it turns into something more.
Complicated than at home it'll be a.
Different story.
Right right with a real fighting.
Physical fight brings out the bat that's.
Why maybe that's why i'm reserved.
Because i know that hmm we'll figure it.
Out later.
Yeah not worth not worth bringing it.
Into the working environment because it.
Could bring everybody else down and true.
That is true i can make things harder.
Mm-hmm okay.
Well that's just something i wondered.
About yeah but we kind of jumped right.
Into it like we we went to what you do.
Like we need to get to know how they met.
And stuff let's go quite a lot to go.
Order man okay just need to be corelogic.
I wanted to be hi mom does she listen to.
Oh what's your dad i think they do yeah.
That's cute okay well watch time baby.
Yeah but yeah so you how about talk.
About how you and gregg met cuz gregg.
Was looked way different and was way.
Different back then he did and you're.
Kind of an emo girl like a goth girl oh.
You're a hot topic model you're talking.
About her high school days and when they.
First met in south that's why oh haha i.
Still really love hot topic yeah your.
Outfit looks straight out of hot topic.
Is that yeah i mean you you've always.
Had a unique i went out i don't say.
Hipster but like you have like a unique.
Sense of fat you're a fashion person.
Mm-hmm i think it's fun yeah.
Um are we getting into how we met yeah.
Okay he's gonna ignore my question.
Formally right how we met formally oh.
Yeah cuz you guys think you guys met.
Yeah yeah we'll talk about that we'll.
Talk about that our story time mm-hmm.
Look at that she's all giddy still she's.
Still got butterflies thinking about him.
That's disgusting.
Oh gail stop um we met it was my first.
Year in high school and it was my first.
Homecoming and he was actually the blind.
Date of my best friend at the time so we.
Met we had our homecoming dinner at the.
Mall food court and then greg shows up.
And that's how we formally met and i.
Just remember during the dance like my.
Friend didn't want to dance with him.
Greg was kind of a wallflower that.
Entire night and he went to a different.
High school the first two years before.
He switched over to mine so he would.
Come to every dance like our friends.
Would take turns bidding him in you know.
When you fill out an application for.
Someone from another school to attend.
The dance right so he would always be.
There and dance with him so i feel like.
He i kind of wanted to talk to him more.
And more and then after summer break.
Like he started attending school just.
Two years later though right here is.
This yeah show your age real quick.
Graduated 15 years ago right yeah mm.
Four or five ish 2005 um so you.
Basically for for two years you're just.
Like man this is really weird guy that.
Just keeps hanging around our friends.
But doesn't ever dance yeah and then you.
Were attracted to that yeah all right.
Guys no you know it's a bag of dana he's.
Just gotta be a you know hang around.
Don't really get involved be a.
Wallflower but like every time every.
Time it would come around he would.
Always be like that silly guy and he had.
An afro at the time which is hard to.
Believe now he had a big afro and he.
Would wear like ginormous hoop earrings.
Mismatched clothes like he was always so.
Quirky but he was super shy at the time.
So i feel like that's what kind of made.
Me interested and i was like i was too.
Shy to ask him to dance but it was so.
Repetitive like they would bring him and.
I always had that curiosity like i want.
To get to know him more but he went to.
Our school and then started dancing in.
Our dance classes and then that.
Friendship builds because we always had.
Yo mutual friends and.
And from there it kind of took off.
Through dance and yeah just hanging out.
Who talked who hit up who first was it.
Ever like oh hey i think you're cute or.
Is it always just like just talking and.
Flirting and then yeah actually um it.
Was pretty random cuz we would hang out.
And then all of a sudden he would kind.
Of send me little messages on myspace.
After school so that was a thing after.
School you'd go home and check your.
Myspace and he would just be like hey i.
Hope you had a good day you're so cool.
Cool that is so like i remember that.
Yeah yeah but the thing was hey i.
Actually had a crush for a son one of.
His friends so it's one of the step boys.
Er um a little bit before like one of.
The step boys close friends like right.
Outside of the group like a brother a.
Cousin yeah so i was so creepy in high.
School.
Explain that okay i don't know i.
Actually don't know this story that.
Neither do i did you do i mean you're.
Still kind of creepy now bleh.
So i would if i liked a boy i would just.
Kind of like follow him around or just.
Kind of so that boy i liked i see you.
Building up your courage i've never.
Heard about this go ahead okay let's say.
This psycho dana yes i don't know if i.
Still have it it's probably deep in my.
Closet but that boy that i liked he.
Stepped on a plate but you said i don't.
Know if i still have it but that boy is.
In my closet.
Here's some scary okay i'm sorry i.
Didn't mean to interrupt sorry data yeah.
Way cooler no go ahead.
He like he stepped on a plate at lunch a.
Paper plate it was laying on the floor.
And he left like a shoe print on it.
And like right when he walked away i.
Took the plate and i was kind of joking.
Off to my friends because they knew that.
We all kind of liked him he was he was a.
Cutie so i took the plate and i like put.
Clear tape on it to laminate it and.
Preserve it and i kept it i may have had.
Him sign it like i think they all kind.
Of knew that i was crushing pretty hard.
Right um and i think he knew it too so.
It would kind of be more of a playful.
Thing like watch i'll do this type thing.
That's so creepy it is but back then you.
Didn't think um so i did that and i.
Would like draw a cartoon version of him.
On my planner but the thing was when i.
Started showing more interest in greg.
Like i drew a doodle of greg next to the.
Guy with afro and the hoop earrings and.
I think greg and i spend more time.
Together like in dance class that really.
Brought us together.
And that's when things started like.
Actually happening i feel like with the.
First guy was crushing out it was more.
Playful like trying to joke around cuz.
He was super cute yeah greg was always a.
Person that i was very interested in.
He's such a unique character yeah we can.
All agree on that.
Um i know someone i peaked on twitter.
And someone asked like what made you.
Fall in love with him and stuff and our.
Shadow think like on my drive here.
Stooping to the good-good when he went.
To our school he was on like the.
Audiovideo audiovideo audiovideo team.
And he would do the morning.
Announcements so he would read the lunch.
The daily lunch that would be you know.
On the tv they would roll they still had.
The tvs that they would roll in play the.
Morning announcements he would read.
Lunch or any news and.
But he had the afro and the big earrings.
And like everybody saw him as this.
Character i was like oh he's so cool and.
That's why that's when you fell in love.
Is that what you were saying you don't.
Know but that was like the moment you.
Just thought that was he was so cool.
He's such a cool character yeah and i.
Think yeah yeah you can tell i i've.
Always been drawn to things that are.
Unique and i guess you can kind of tell.
That yeah yeah.
And then you yourself are very unique in.
Terms of how you would dress and like i.
Mean did that's what you take pride in.
Different and doing things differently.
Stalking people yeah did greg know about.
This like back then yeah he was aware of.
It it sounds like a plot to an 80 summer.
Flick i don't know why yeah you see you.
Like we explained that story and then.
Making doodles of the guy you're like a.
Girl in an anime that's like the main.
Kerala.
With the bad character and was like.
Really handsome and then she ends up.
Falling in love with the guy who's like.
The clown yeah the guy who would have.
Always have like the swirly eyes yeah.
Every time we see it's the true love.
Yeah i get beat up all downstairs while.
You actually sick you saved you would.
Follow guys around that you liked and.
Then saved their footprints yeah.
But the thing was i think everybody kind.
Of jokingly knew i was like that or i.
Kind of made that character for myself.
I'm a joke yeah but i feel like greg.
Kind of he made it seem like there was.
No need for me to do that anymore.
Right because after we started like.
Talking like a couple months into our.
Relationship.
He went from having an afro to doing.
Like the rat tail things yeah so when he.
Asked me to homecoming or some other.
Dance.
He had like a ring container thank what.
Do you call that a ring bell ring boxes.
Yeah yeah i don't know so he waited for.
Me at lunch and all of our friends were.
There and he had this box and he.
Presented it to me and it was the lock.
Of his rat tail.
I have to do anything for that i didn't.
Have to creep behind you it's scissors.
Or anything like that's mine and i have.
Like i have like three at least for.
Those of you that don't know what that.
Is that's when your hair is like what is.
It like a single strand of mullet yeah.
It it's a baby mullet or like a baby boy.
A baby mullet.
Pretty much i used to have that he.
Didn't cut them off and you guys are.
Freaks you guys are pretty that's pretty.
Strange but it's like that's why it's.
Funny and unique yeah yeah you're funny.
Dana i didn't know i did not know i.
Bought that creepy side of you but.
That's funny they call the call do you.
Still do that do you feel like this.
Mustache hairs like you shave off his.
Mustache and present that to you my god.
Every year on your anniversary that's a.
Great idea.
I'm sure there's people who can relate.
Those like very i mean it seems like.
Anatomy right i don't know why i think.
Adam a i'm just picturing you like a.
Girl literally fault like stalking.
Someone that they like but usually like.
A anime thing cuz in an anime that's.
Cute.
If you do that in like a lifetime story.
It's it's a murderer it depends on what.
Platform you're in yeah in anime it's.
Like oh it's so funny it's cute and then.
You know but in real life oh it happened.
In real life yeah i'm glad your don't.
Agree yeah yeah okay i did not know that.
To be honest yeah oh yeah and then um.
Informally you know we have a hunch that.
You met someone before mm-hmm.
Because we went to the same elementary.
School and middle school and i don't.
Know if you guys had like like rainy day.
Fridays but you would have designated.
Days where mixed grades would come.
Together and the last two hours of the.
School day you can go to a room that's.
Watching a movie or you can go into a.
Room that's all coloring or toys and.
Stuff like that i loved it it was so.
Much fun.
High school in elementary school and.
I remember going into the toy room and.
Just like a little a little 10 boy.
Asking to play with me and we we did the.
You know what a marble run is is where.
You build.
Yep-yep contraption you roll the marble.
But we both remember playing with that.
That was our go-to thing and i told him.
Like i remember specifically this one.
Time that i played with a little boy who.
Is tan yes are you all you remember.
Maybe a little bit of shadow already he.
Was born with a hairy kid yeah really i.
Did not know that yeah so we did that.
And i feel like while we were talking it.
Was a random story but i want to say.
That we both kind of got that feeling.
That it was fate because i also had that.
Experience with another friend in.
Preschool and i never i have totally.
Forgot about it and i met up with a.
Friend near the end of high school and.
We became best friends and then there.
Was this one time where we were talking.
About do you remember playing with a.
Girl in preschool like blocks and so a.
Similar story and a couple of months.
Later a couple weeks later he comes with.
A picture of us playing on the floor.
He's like this is yeah so it was weird.
And it was a very similar feeling huh.
Yeah maybe you were just following him.
This whole time.
That's cool i mean that's classic.
Clothes do you remember anything from.
Preschool i do i do.
Why do you not i heart i don't remember.
Too much just like embarrassing moments.
Like peeing in my cot or like cutting my.
Own hair yeah stuff like that peeing in.
Your cut yeah go ahead.
Yeah like a small bed you know oh you.
Used to peel on in the bed yeah last.
Week too had to change the sheets.
So whatever dude grown man is a grown.
Man has grown men you know just shows.
That my body's working yeah i just i.
Remember.
Not being a good kid i used to get in.
Trouble a lot as a preschooler yeah used.
To beat up girls.
No i didn't i was one time and it wasn't.
Be dying it's just we're not getting.
Into that one hitter quitter yeah okay.
Whatever.
No but you know it's funny too cuz in.
Preschool i don't know my mom told me.
This but i do remember giving attitude.
Or like being really annoyed with the.
Ladies that ran in the place and i just.
Wouldn't get along with it listen to.
Them i wouldn't get along with them i.
Wouldn't listen to them but i was told.
That when when there was a guy there.
I would like like him and listen to him.
Sallis i was your sexist i was dude.
You're gonna get for that hashtag.
No i mean yeah i mean that's that's what.
I was told i mean i don't recall being.
Sexist but i guess i didn't like i don't.
Know that's all i remember.
Wow well we went to your grandma's house.
At one time and you showed us that.
Picture where you couldn't sit still and.
Like this totally looks like something.
So it's it's a picture of me as like a 3.
Or 4 year old and my hands like this and.
Like it raising up into the picture and.
That's cuz the ladies were holding my.
Arms i wouldn't want to take the picture.
And i look really pissed and i guess.
They took a bunch of shots and that's.
The only one they could use do we have.
That we have to show that that's you'd.
Have to go back home i don't know who.
Did that i don't know but yep that's all.
I remember so you were a crazy stalker i.
Was a sexist and you were a poo poo pee.
Pee boy yeah but that being said poopy.
And pee it's time for our shisha break.
We'll be right back.
Music.
I brought she's knocking huh i brought.
You something i just remembered oh wait.

Very positive but i wanted to hear like.
You know there's gonna be people who.
Don't like it like anybody like you just.
Like rep you know the red bull like i.
Like the taste of it but like initially.
When i first drank it i wasn't a fan.
I'll tell you what people are gonna say.
About yours it's too sour milk is weird.
Doesn't taste like milk though the.
Closest thing in terms of the thing is.
When you hear about it you probably.
Think oh that's gross an energy drink.
Like milk and it's white - right but.
What i wanted i wanted it to be white i.
Wanted to be different and the the.
Inspiration was kind of like those like.
I don't know what those things are.
Called like after you eat korean.
Barbecue you know like those kind of.
Drinks i can in asia we have a lot a lot.
Of it yoku little big things uh yeah i.
Mean i there's nothing yeah kind of like.
That like the yogurt yeah kyle pico from.
Japan yeah like this there's not there's.
A lot of that in asia and i really like.
Those drinks there's no energy drinks.
But you know i wanted to bring that here.
And nobody really nobody in the u.s.
Wanted to do it so we we work out of the.
Netherlands that's our production nobody.
Want to do it and there's good reason.
It's a big risk but you know that's.
Ninja milk and anna and i are drinking.
It cheers he's not supportive thanks.
Dana this is what it sounds like so good.
Ninja muqaam where were we sorry i.
Wasn't going to add mode well i mean.
It's the second half yeah yeah we have a.
Lot of those yeah we're interested okay.
What do we have here first.
Nelly from nelly which prop costume was.
The most difficult to create proper.
Costume most difficult for people who.
Don't know dana does all the costumes in.
Props props.
Yeah oh um the bj light sticks oh yeah.
So that ii bg a video the light sticks.
That light up yeah those were good yeah.
Danny dana and made those that was a.
Process because well you texted me the.
Idea mhm mhm and they were all hand-cut.
From acrylic like we got a special saw.
For it and i had no idea how to operate.
It and it was a very big learning curve.
And i tried so many things like i put.
The stick on the flashlight and you.
Wanted both silver and gold and i'm.
Trying to figure out how to color it how.
To do that yeah so the light sticks.
Ended up being clear but i spray-painted.
Them like half or six gold six silver.
And i just didn't like the way it looked.
You couldn't really see it glow as much.
Afterwards so the day before we sent you.
To la with them i had a big bottle of.
Nail polish remover and i was like hand.
Removing all of the spray paint out of.
All the crevices and everything just.
Like undoing there was two days of work.
And on top of that we were working on.
The star wars video at the same time.
Because we we filmed that a few days and.
Then you had to leave to do the bga.
Stuff so then we were like picking up.
While you were away but i feel like the.
Fact that we were doing two projects at.
Once and it was a lot of back and forth.
So that was the hardest problem and the.
Star wars one had a lot of costumes -.
Mm-hmm so i was just at all at the same.
Time but yeah difficult to wise that was.
That's i mean it look legit thanks yeah.
I mean that couldn't have been easy it's.
Hard - yeah cut a straight line from.
Acrylic yeah i think that was actual.
Like a blood sweat and tears project.
Because it was overwhelming we were.
Working on multiple videos at the time i.
Was trying to learn how to use this saw.
And the acrylic it's kind of sharp so i.
Definitely got in.
Several times you actually got cut it's.
Got like sharp ends when you after you.
Pull it through there's a little chars.
That come off or if you're trying to.
Like smoothing edges and you you catch a.
Little bit yeah.
All right but it was fun i think i.
Really like learned or i felt.
Accomplished like i taught myself how to.
Do this actually why don't you talk up.
Talk about how also you kind of got into.
Rhpc cuz that was like unexpected right.
Yep yeah okay more story time yeah fun.
Fact like i met you before greg met you.
Ii do you remember how we met is that is.
The third grade dude you're the kid no.
It was at your house right my house so.
You were living in north hollywood at.
The time with doc yep yep and well dom.
Kind of grew up around my family a lot.
So it was no surprise that he would.
Spend holidays at my parents house so.
When he came back for thanksgiving he.
Brought you along with him.
So we met you at my parents house on.
Thanksgiving no staying there hey you're.
Back yeah you were staying at yeah you.
Were staying with us and that also was.
When agents of secret stuff came out too.
So we spent thanksgiving watching agent.
To secret stuff with all my and then the.
Day after was our thanksgiving party.
Uh-huh and you dressed me up i tell was.
The beginning of her career she dressed.
Me out she thought of because so.
Basically you guys have these these.
Parties these thanksgiving parties where.
They all dress up and like you know.
There's pilgrims and dana basically i.
Didn't have a costume because i didn't.
Know i'm gonna be you know most people.
Don't dress up as anything she made me a.
Pilgrim with within a day mm-hmm oh i.
Miss those parties yeah when we were.
Living back at home we would have these.
Themed parties and for thanksgiving we.
Would throw like yeah costumes in a bag.
And for thanksgiving it was you could.
Either draw a pilgrim or an indian and.
There was like two teams and we would.
Have a whole like thanksgiving olympics.
Yeah.
Feast and like competitions and relay.
Races and it's so much fun but we were.
All on the pilgrim side me you and dom.
So i had my costume others need to get.
Our line races so within 24 hours of.
Meeting you i was already dressing you.
Yeah and that was and that's when we.
First met yeah yeah but the actual thing.
That brought it all together was if you.
Want to talk more about it because what.
You actually design was amazing.
Which one the the cloud thing right oh.
That's right so even before i moved out.
Here i was still doing stuff for you.
Guys cuz that's when you would got.
Brought greg on yeah and i would come.
Out to visit him and it just so happened.
To be like oh you're gonna be in town.
You could help us with his stuff so i.
Was visiting with some friends and i.
Helped you guys make a cloud video for.
The 10-million the lamp clouds mm-hmm.
That was a lot of fun so i helped out.
With that for that week and then i went.
Home and then i came back a second time.
And that's when we did the tea time room.
Mm-hmm.
Well originally because i mean people.
Don't know i'm sure that you went to.
College for interior design yeah and i.
Mean even when you first came out here.
It wasn't from my impression i i just.
Thought you were you're coming here to.
Do that it was this was gonna be like a.
Short term like oh so you don't have.
Anything else yeah you want to just come.
Help us out you know just kind of casual.
Yeah and then i just found like wow this.
Is like so much so much value in terms.
Of what you can do it's so little yeah i.
Think that's your gift in terms of like.
It's it's very difficult to be creative.
With not much and ain't even greg to.
Like both of you are very similar in.
That you can make something pretty legit.
With not much mm-hm and that's big for.
Me because it saves me a lot of money so.
I'm gonna buy the real like i don't.
Gonna buy actual clothes sticks okay hey.
Dana do you think and the thing is i'll.
Always be like do you think you guys.
Could make this and i've never heard no.
Yeah like it's always like what okay.
Like even if it's really difficult and.
Then greg will be like yeah i think dan.
I think we'll figure it out yeah but.
It's never like no even though it should.
Sometimes probably be a no really yeah.
Like uh if when you're like oh can you.
Help if i have to help them with props.
When you asked me to help them i know.
It's like a bigger project sometimes.
I'll go over there and i'll start.
Helping them i'm like how are they doing.
This and they're like yeah we should.
Have said no it's like going at it.
They're so creative it's crazy like.
You're the epic snort snort epic snort.
No video like you called me and you.
Talked to me about it and you wanted.
Like this frozen castle and multi-levels.
And stuff and greg was editing another.
Video at the time but i had you on.
Speakerphone and i hung up and greg and.
I looked at each other i know i need i.
Need people to do listen tell me no.
Because i go to big things we do it i.
Think that's almost fun in the.
Challenger you know we make something.
Work it might not always be.
Three-dimensional i guess it gets to a.
Certain degree yeah yeah but it's part.
Of the fun yeah i mean it's it's.
Definitely it's definitely i know.
Sometimes i'm just asking but like i.
Already know you're just you're not.
Gonna say no sometimes i tell great to.
Like just tell me this is not realistic.
I can dumb it down more but ryan's like.
That really pretty girl it like you know.
And then you guys are like the boyfriend.
And ron's like can i have this and then.
You even though he knows like he.
Shouldn't be getting it you guys like.
You know anything for you babe it's like.
That's oh no i'm going with this analogy.
All right i'm just saying they're.
They'll do anything for you because they.
Appreciate you so much mmm that's some.
Way you've found a way to make that but.
Not that's not if i was dating you i'd.
Say no find a much better guy so what.
When you first were bringing her on you.
Thought a short term what you hated long.
Term um yeah what just kept like she.
Just kept help at first she was just.
Helping for free like she was just like.
Oh i i'm i'm sure dana will help make.
That it was always just like dan just.
Helping and then we were like okay well.
If she's gonna be.
Doing this you know delicious bring her.
On for a little bit because at the time.
I was still thinking you were still.
Looking for that you know interior.
Design kind of job i don't even know one.
Of those like shows like those problems.
Well yeah well i have my bachelor's in.
Interior design and my concentration in.
Interior architecture so i did it all.
You know like the cod and the model.
Making and stuff but i feel like what.
I'm doing for you now or the more.
Hands-on stuff is kind of more relatable.
To what i was working on when i was at.
Home because my previous job was like.
More civil stuff and it kind of became.
Into something that i haven't tapped.
Into and it i had no intention of going.
Further in that but with what we're.
Doing i use a lot of my model making.
Skills and you know learning what.
Materials to use and what works as well.
As aesthetics and making sure things.
Look cohesive and all the little crafty.
Tedious things basically right but yeah.
When i came out here it was fun helping.
You guys and i did have a couple clients.
From back home that i was doing like a.
Broad staff for us i would send them.
Like cad sketches and stuff and then i.
Did a couple of jobs for interior design.
Out here for my previous job yeah that's.
Literally what your expertise is mm-hmm.
Because she designed the for people who.
Watched second channel the tea time room.
And that was like i mean we i wasn't.
Expecting that like something so.
Professional but i mean that's it was.
Around that time i would say yeah all.
This - with sean we actually have a.
Video of that was supposed to go of the.
Making of this room i don't know where.
That video is i think it's going sean's.
Computer somewhere somewhere yeah.
There's there's a video of them making.
This room yeah and you helped there was.
A segment where i guess you can't see it.
Now but the the rhino that's above you.
You helped me i did it was part of the.
Video yeah it never came out it's still.
One day it might one day.
There's a lot of videos that are like.
One day one day there's some videos.
Though that that haven't we i haven't.
Posted that i know it'll be the right.
Time it just used to marinate like fan.
Ball has to marinate i'm telling you.
Don't just trust me dude i know these.
Don't work work a dana so i mean we kind.
Of already discuss some other things.
Like how you and greg fell in love and.
Stuff boring and also you know like the.
Props that you guys made boring um and.
Then i guess he stopped insulting her so.
Much people already think you hate her.
Like a lot of people from the other.
Videos thing you know say oh yeah you're.
Here to defend your side here and yeah.
You can let's talk about that how paco.
Is like really mean to you i know in a.
Joking way but sometimes it's like even.
For us were like cringing oh yeah i mean.
To everybody you are but it's a.
Different amount but we're sexist we.
Here's a least sexist because you treat.
Dana how you treat us exactly all.
Feminists yeah i get opportunity disses.
Coming all around your but some things.
You say to her you can't get away with.
Oh sorry i didn't mean to interrupt.
Talk about your side of the story i.
Guess paco is a feminist and i was i'm a.
Three at best tell him tell him what he.
Said we to update people yeah i've been.
Wanting to explain my side of the story.
Because when talk were told that story.
About how one of our friends asked.
Monica if she's on the team or not or if.
She's yeah with us and you said what did.
She say like she's too good-looking.
Like she's monica's too good-looking to.
Be see and you said that i said but it.
Was actually well that's a story she'll.
Be about better context basically we.
Were like oh yeah what is monica in the.
Group and i was like what no monica.
Stood up to attracted to be in the group.
And then someone is like what about dana.
And i forgot that like you know dana's.
Like part of it but you just got to.
Commit to the joke.
Like what dana's like a three at best.
And then i said afford okay way better.
Now you defend yourself.
So it was monica that said after you.
Said she's sooo good looking to be in.
The group monica goes oh so it was.
Monica that said that and then i went.
Yeah yeah you're right.
She just wanted to clarify but it's even.
More sad because she's just like she's.
Not like offended she's just like yeah.
That's even more offensive you hurt her.
You don't you don't care about that.
Stuff but it's just like the way that i.
Don't know this is some things you don't.
I don't know maybe i am a sexist person.
I'd i don't treat girls the same way i.
Wouldn't say that to a girl i think.
Friends to like self-deprecation is like.
Our security blaze automatically it's.
More of like a light-hearted thing i.
Don't know if i would say it to anyone.
In the group oh you're like a three at.
Best maybe only you actually because you.
Would say that to me yeah i don't said.
To greg or will or any of them that's.
Also be up for me i think i'm in a.
Position that i can say that you say.
Messed up things all the time yeah.
Because you guys like do mess up things.
To me so this is our dynamic what are.
You talking about are you talking i.
Don't i don't yeah i don't know we don't.
Say those kind of things to you you.
Don't we give you helpful advice but.
That's because that's just how we talk.
There's example the relationship is dana.
I don't talk like that to dana.
But greg really or any of us just you.
That's okay that's what makes you.
Interesting all right let's just do it.
One last i mean the only really good.
Question that's left is like what would.
You be doing if you weren't working with.
Rhpc we just talked about what you went.
Into and then how she got that what.
Would you be doing oh that's true um.
Well it's not like i don't have time i i.
Would like to do something fun on the.
Side too cuz there are times where.
You know you're writing gregg's editing.
All the graphics and thumbnails are made.
And i do have a little bit of time i.
Would like to do i would like to do.
Something fun and crafty maybe like.
Greeting cards or i've been practicing.
Calligraphy yeah i think that would be.
Fun something artistic that i can.
Control or create a fun product either.
That or like musical theatre would be.
Fun yeah you do like to you're good.
Singer and well actually i didn't know.
About they that's it a really.
Interesting thing.
Dana's greeting cards or birthday i.
Don't know maybe those kind of things.
Yeah yeah and would you write like the.
Things in it to like funny ones or like.
Just sure or lame custom you know oh.
Yeah yeah.
Here if as soon as ryan fires all of us.
Start a patreon okay and then you know.
Different tiers and then people can.
Order your stuff hmm should i start one.
Know when i fire me again thank you sure.
We're still here i've always wanted to.
Do i mean i have no artistic side but i.
Always want to make the jokes cuz i used.
To like reading the the comedic ones.
Like you know there's so many of them.
That are just like lame puns yeah i'll.
Be great at liam policy very close but.
Then but then i couldn't do the art.
Because it's poorly draw you have the.
Puns and you attempt to doodle it it's.
Much more entertaining looking at your.
Stuff than like looking at one of ours.
And having it look good oh yeah i agree.
Him have some house do the art because.
Even with manga like the people that.
Will write or have ideas they aren't.
Necessarily always the artists right so.
You know where she's making a joke that.
It would look like a little kid drew.
Yeah that's how i you i love that you.
Love it cuz you're good at drawing the.
Rest of us normal people you can't draw.
Or like people don't stalk yeah this is.
Crap like the thing that you made for.
Shaun before he left like it was oh my.
God it was delightful like i tried.
Really hard i shouldn't and i think.
That's what i would rather appreciate it.
