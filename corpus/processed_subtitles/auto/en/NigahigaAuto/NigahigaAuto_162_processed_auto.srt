Like anytime i i wouldn't meet someone.
And i walk in the room and i'm a 6-3.
Black guy and they're like basketball.
Right.
That's usually what they assume when i.
Go back to the studio tomorrow there's.
Gonna be a bunch of boxes waiting for me.
And i'm just pumped to open like his.
Christmas every time if i'd only use one.
Phone that i would use the one plus.
Seven preps.
Welcome back to another episode about.
The pill podcast today yeah we have.
David the moderator see paco's next to.
Me i'm ryan and another very special.
Guest mr. marques brownlee in the house.
Everybody oh wow beautiful that's all.
You get we don't really use that know.
One of the biggest if not the biggest.
Probably tech youtuber in fact you are.
The biggest taking youtuber for sure.
There's a bunch of other channels that.
Also do tagged you've been around a long.
Time but i've been doing just tech haha.
Okay and you're in town so thank you.
Again cuz you're normally in new york.
Right yeah new jersey uh-huh east coast.
Okay and then you're here for i don't.
Know if you want to bring it up i do.
You're here dude so i came out here.
We're in la for there is a motorola.
Event where they they announced you know.
You've probably had the razor one of the.
Most popular phones ever made a folding.
Screen version of it and so it was.
They're having this announcement event.
It was cool we got to see it in person.
It was revealed mm-hmm but the event.
Itself was pretty bad.
And i think kind of like roasting them.
On in my video in other places but it's.
A it's happened it's out there now it's.
It's out there that motorola doesn't.
Know how to throw events i can tell it's.
Been a while yeah well the last phone.
They even had well we have a lot of.
Mid-range phones like their moto g is.
One of the most popular like $350 phones.
And so they don't really have to do a.
Big showy fancy event for it they just.
Put it out and suddenly it's the most.
Well selling phone on amazon because.
People love cheap phones really oh but.
You know big 900 this is a $1500 phone.
They got to do some some showy stuff.
They tried to put on an event diplo was.
There but it wasn't that great was the.
Music good no sorry but in general i.
Mean like you said you like the phone.
Though yeah i mean it was so i didn't.
Even use a razor but like i could tell.
Like just from holding it like wow this.
Is kind of cool a little folding screen.
Thing is still pretty sweet i don't know.
If it's worth $1500 oh my gosh i think.
You have to really love that nostalgia.
That they're sort of wrapping it in and.
I think a lot of people will try to get.
It for that reason but yeah i mean i saw.
A mean movie i thought it was fake but.
That's i mean it does look cool i mean i.
Don't know at functionality-wise i don't.
Know but and that's kind of a thing that.
Uh other companies are pushing right the.
Foldable screen stuff yeah yeah yeah.
Samsung has one huawei has one this.
Company royal made one there's like a.
Couple floating out there but they're.
All over $2,000 so on one hand this is.
One of the cheaper folding screen phones.
But it's still like an iphone is you.
Know a thousand eleven hundred bucks and.
Most people are just just getting a new.
Iphone right so you gotta you gotta have.
A real reason to spend that much so.
Right they're trying so you're.
Constantly going to these different.
Events and releases and stuff because i.
Mean that's what you do yeah and i'm.
Sure people invite you and bring you out.
Because it benefits them the thing i.
Appreciate is that you're pretty honest.
With your reviews like it's not always.
Positive and i'm sure they're bringing.
Out or even paying you how do you manage.
That if some if someone's bringing you.
Out and even if i don't know maybe they.
Don't but i'm sure there must be like.
Some kind of compensation right since.
You're doing them free promo there has.
Never been ever so i've done so i yeah.
Fly to events i go i pay for the flight.
In the hotel really go out there they.
Always invite me and it'll be up to me.
To decide is it worth going like is this.
One of those things that people are.
Interested in should i go see it or not.
The motorola one i was like yeah people.
Who will care about this folding phone.
Like or the more interesting things this.
Year but yeah a lot of times there is.
Events that are just sort of more casual.
Or and i'll just not go or they'll.
Invite me in a.
I have to decide it's worth it but in.
General i just know that valuing my.
Honesty yeah like is actually that's the.
Reason i'm there is to give you my.
Impressions what i really think is the.
Product worth the money that either.
They're announcing they're gonna charge.
For it that's what i'm there to show so.
If i'm not honest and none of that's.
Worth it for anyone right right right.
Right yeah okay well that's i mean.
That's good to know.
Yeah so how long exactly have you been.
Doing it 2009 was the first video so.
Almost 11 years 11 years do you still i.
Mean it seems like you enjoy it but yeah.
At some point i mean i'm sure it's.
Exciting as you you're really into it.
But some point is there ever time where.
You're just like man i just want try.
Other stuff kind of yes but also so much.
Of what i'm into is trying to make the.
Videos as good as possible.
Uh-huh and the more you do in this i'm.
Sure you know like in this world of like.
Trying to make videos unique and better.
The more you find that you can also try.
To do mm-hm and so we're in this like.
Crazy world of like we got this camera.
Robot that's specifically made for.
Moving a camera.
It's you'd see a robot in like a factory.
That would like move parts around mm-hmm.
A company has like written software to.
Control it and keyframe it and so now.
We're attaching the camera to it and.
Like having the robot do crazy camera.
Moves we're at this point now we're like.
That's the type of fun that we have.
Making a video well that's kind of where.
Exactly where like if i was just doing.
The same type of video i did eight years.
Ago i'd probably be really bored but.
That's just just advancing your craft.
Actually exactly it just so happens to.
Be something you're still interested in.
Yeah yeah that's always gonna be new.
Tech exactly that's part of why my job.
Is easy i don't have to be interesting.
And exciting and i mean i guess often.
You know you have to be a little more.
Than my normal self but i like the tech.
Has to be interesting and so i don't.
Have to work as hard as the engineers.
Trying to get everyone's attention right.
Have you always been into tech like what.
What got you started and all that yeah i.
Feel like i have pretty much always been.
Into tech somewhat of a nerd my dad was.
An it i don't know if that had anything.
To do with it but you know finding you.
Know computer when i was in high school.
And buying my first ipod touch and being.
Like this is amazing i went on box it in.
Front of a camera like that's probably a.
Pretty nerdy thing to do so like i've.
Always been into tech.
Someone i also read that you majored in.
Business and information technology that.
That must also play into like what you.
Know your your passions right yeah yeah.
I and i went to a tech school so that's.
Like almost everyone there was technical.
In some way i've you know i always had.
The my best score all nine times i took.
The sat it was always the math section.
So i feel like i've always yeah had sort.
Of a technical inclination but then it's.
Just exciting like new gadgets are just.
Fun so it sounds like you were made for.
This like with your dad being an it do.
You talk to him a lot about like.
Different gadgets that come out and was.
That was that always like a part of your.
Life growing up uh yeah and his job is.
Like about like solutions in a way so.
Software solutions like custom you know.
Infrastructure type stuff so it's not.
Even like the gadgets he's like more.
Like behind the scenes but even that.
Like now that's like what we talk about.
Is like did you see this new phone or.
Are you trying out the chromebooks right.
Now what's your deal so like yeah that's.
Just sort of always been part of what we.
Talk about and how old are you 25 25.
Yeah and you've been doing like.
Interested in tech stuff for a long time.
Since like a young age then yeah and was.
It ever an issue where you were growing.
Up like that people because you know a.
Lot of people are like oh black people.
Should be athletic which you are because.
You'd play on a professional frisbee.
Team and currently yeah team yeah it's a.
Pretty new world a pro ultimate ultimate.
Frisbee is like 50 years old but yeah.
Row ultimate is pretty new yeah.
Does that mean you get paid to play the.
Game someone yeah it's almost nobody's.
Full-time job yeah everyone who plays.
Professional too prefers me pretty much.
Always also has there a doctor a teacher.
Or whatever uh-huh but yeah when we go.
Out and we play in front of a stand full.
Of fans and there's referees and it's.
Like it feels like a pro thing that's.
Like the craziest part yeah like what.
Else things like you're not only smart.
You do have the athletic side so but did.
You ever have to deal with people.
Teasing you because like oh why don't.
You play like.
Or whatever yes dear - yeah i don't know.
If it probably wasn't ever teasing as.
Much as it was just like it almost seems.
Like an innocent question like anytime i.
Like meet someone and i walk in the room.
And i'm a 6-3 black guy and they're like.
Basketball right that's usually what.
They assume i actually remember pretty.
Recently i like called an uber from.
Newark airport and i like timed it.
Perfectly so that i was walking out the.
Airport as the uber pulled up and i like.
Walk out the airport and as i was.
Getting in some like lady saw that and.
Literally was like i don't know who you.
Are but i'm sure you're probably an.
Athlete so hi whoa just because like she.
Assumed that that's like something like.
And like a giants player random just a.
Random person whoa do you take offense.
To those things i don't take offense.
Well she's also not wrong she doesn't.
Dude you're a pro at yeah it's like it's.
Almost like the the implication is like.
That's definitely what you're probably.
Gonna be doing and i watch basketball i.
Love basketball but yeah that's i get.
The innocent assumptions i think you.
Have a tuna so kinda i watched the.
Rockets games oh and that's because i.
Was following chris paul for like the.
Last like five or six years now that.
He's not when he got to the rockets i.
Started watching them and then james.
Harden started having historic seasons.
And now he's on the thunder which is way.
Like the sighting so i'm just a rockets.
Viewer now really but you're from new.
York.
Like the nets are over the nets i.
Started liking the new jersey nets.
They moved to new york yep they're.
Pretty great but the knicks voice - my.
Dad's a knicks fan.
I apologize every time that he's still.
In expand to him but i yeah i've never.
Really had like an allegiance like to a.
City i just want to respect some players.
I i think something about his game like.
I've been a defensive player in ultimate.
Frisbee and chris paul's defense.
Specifically we're the same height and i.
Feel like i watch him move and i'm like.
That dudes like n basically i think he's.
Like 6 1 yeah there's something like.
That but like he's an awesome defender.
And his iq is off the charts and i just.
Like watching smart players be at him no.
Because you've met a lot of i've met.
Some players yeah i have not met chris.
Paul but i have been to a couple rockets.
Games.
Yeah yeah bettina i have always been a.
Spurs fan it's personal to get pick.
Rivals kinda they've ended the rocket.
Season once or twice yeah and well i.
Think we're we we've got we've have a.
Bigger rivalry with dallas to be fair.
From back in the day anyway we're.
Irrelevant now.
So i think you can make the playoffs.
Here    let's see man we'll see but.
That's kinda surprising actually you're.
A houston fan and chris paul.
But speaking of people that you've met i.
Mean you just a quick youtube search.
Google search the people that you've.
Interviewed and talk to is it's kind of.
Amazing.
And i just thought we'd bring it up i.
Mean like bill gates.
Elon musk kobe bryant neil degrasse.
Tyson will smith in the most recent.
Rewind just said he's one of the first.
Things he says is your name yeah i mean.
That's gotta be kind of cool pretty wild.
Yeah it's always fascinating when i do.
Like an interview or something like that.
To figure out like every interview yeah.
Every interview has its own like.
Circumstance of like you know someone's.
On a press tour or they're they're just.
Trying to do their youtube presence.
Whatever they're trying to do robles.
Yeah and it's always fascinating to like.
Try to figure out what that situation is.
And yes some of them are just like they.
Just want it to be in a video they just.
Wanted to be on the channel neil.
Degrasse tyson was doing he was shooting.
Some of his tv show called star talk.
Radio show.
Macie million a radio show and there's.
Like we got to get you in and they just.
Saw in your work.
Yeah and i think obviously the audience.
Has part to do with that but like the.
Tech connection and a lot of times they.
They want to be in this tech world and.
They don't know exactly how to but.
Obviously they've watched some videos or.
Something that gets them interested.
That's been a way to do that you want.
Had no other reason he's just like yeah.
I'll do it.
Wasn't he doesn't have any reason to do.
A press tour but like down to do yeah so.
So was it a combination of you reaching.
Out to some folks and then some of them.
Reaching out to you definitely yeah.
Probably about half and half a lot of.
People have their team's reach out and.
It's always like their team's trying to.
Reach out to my team but my team's just.
Me so it's just me answering their email.
Are you not represented by neh.
I do manager yeah i do have an agency.
And they have worked it on like a couple.
Smaller like sponsored projects but.
Every single one of the interviews has.
Been through me so yeah it's just them.
Emailing me like who do we get in touch.
With i'm like me oh wow you have a.
Personal touch on there i guess then.
That exactly yeah and i can talk.
Creative with them pretty much right off.
The bat usually they're like what can we.
Can we do a video and i'm like well.
Here's the talking tech series you've.
Probably seen this and we can talk about.
Whatever tech stuff that they're into so.
Yeah have you have you had good good.
Experiences with with having agents and.
Managers in the past being an online you.
Know concentrator yeah my experience is.
Pretty limited i've only had one agency.
That i've worked with and so technically.
One agent  manager but other than that.
It's pretty i don't even do that much.
Like sponsored stuff or any crazy.
Extracurricular like outside of the.
Video stuff so i haven't really had too.
Notable of an experience does that mean.
That the gear that you receive to review.
Are they are they just sending it to.
Your is it are you buying them a little.
Bit of both mostly really that's.
Probably so it depends on what kind of.
Gear the the stuff i'm reviewing like.
The smartphones the the headphones the.
Gadgets that's probably like 80% sent to.
Me 20% and bought but it's gonna end up.
In the video no matter what if they.
Don't send it i'll buy it but all the.
Other stuff people think i also get for.
Free like the cameras we use and the.
Studio lighting and the equipment and.
The space like that's obviously all we.
Pay for it but yeah the the smartphones.
Are the main thing that sort of has it.
Down to a science now where they like.
Have a release date they'll send it out.
To a bunch of press and some youtubers.
Five days before the release date and we.
All get to use it and review it and then.
By the time the release stage shows up.
Then our videos are all ready to go so i.
See yeah that must be in a great feeling.
To get something before like the rest of.
The world does yeah like do you still.
Find enjoyment in that because like it.
Seems like you get every single phone.
That ever exists or has ever created.
Yeah and your.
You know it's like do you feel that like.
Christmas feeling like i get to open a.
New new thing it's still kind of a dream.
Job yeah i feels like when i go back to.
The studio tomorrow there's gonna be a.
Bunch of boxes waiting for me and i'm.
Just pumped to open them like it's.
Christmas every time sometimes it's.
Because i don't have a public like a p.o.
Box or anything for like anyone to send.
Stuff to so every time a package arrives.
I like kind of know what it is but.
Sometimes it's like oh this agency has.
My address they've sent me stuff in the.
Past this is from them but i don't know.
What it is it's probably related to.
Something else like i can sort of piece.
It together but it's usually pretty.
Sweet to just open gadgets time yeah.
What do you do with all the other ones.
You don't you other bad ones.
I can either sell them give them away.
Give them back it would depend on what.
It is i also some people out of old.
Giant storage somewhere it's not.
Actually that bad because a lot of.
Gadgets are pretty small and i'll either.
Throw away the box and then like give.
Away or ship back the item but i keep.
Like about two generations old of.
Smartphones from like every single maker.
So i just have like a it's like a drawer.
Literally full of i have a cd rack and i.
Don't have cds the only way yeah it's.
Like having shoes but it's phones i mean.
How many phones do you have i can.
Imagine you have a ton hey the drawer is.
Getting so heavy that i'm kind of.
Worried that if i open it all the way.
It'll just snap off i think there's.
About a hundred something phones in.
There but i don't know how many phones.
Do you use though currently two two i.
Always have my main android phone and my.
Iphone and my main phone is my main sim.
Card i have two sim cards two which is.
Kind of annoying but my main number and.
Then like my iphone number and that's.
What i carry yeah so do you say your.
Androids your main because if i put my.
Sim card in the iphone notoriously.
Imessage will just start to like take.
Over that sim cards messages okay and.
Ecosystem lock in is also very real and.
I've been part of my job is to be to.
Have a foot in like both ecosystems and.
Constantly be using both so i yeah i'll.
Have like my main phone will be sort of.
Rotating between phones i'm testing.
Which right now i have the pixel four.
Before that it was the one plus seven.
Pro i was just testing a xiaomi me note.
10 and there's just a long line of.
Phones before that but my other phone is.
Has been the iphone 11 pro for a couple.
Months so you're you're are you so would.
You if you have to choose between oh boy.
Yeah at the moment let's just say at the.
Moment the current time right now yeah.
Which one would you choose if he had to.
Choose if you had to only use one phone.
If i had only use one phone that i would.
Use the 1 plus 7 pro wow and that's an.
Android phone and not a lot of people.
Even have heard about but i love the.
Performance it has an awesome high.
Refresh rate screen the camera is not.
That great but a lot of the reasons.
People use the iphone are great about.
That phone too.
So i could do without like the iphone or.
The pixel if i just had to use one but.
Luckily i don't have to use one so i.
Don't did you at any point love apple.
More than android in some worlds yes not.
Even in the video editing world i was a.
Premiere person for like 7 years or.
Something and i finally got convinced to.
Try final cut pro and loved it so for my.
Computer i've been a mac for like four.
Or five straight years and not even.
Close to switching back to a windows.
Desktop i will probably be on a mac as.
Long as i use final cut well i have to.
Be on a mac as long as it's so.
Interesting so many people including us.
We'd switched from final cut to premiere.
Right what do you like so much better.
About final cut okay so a lot of people.
Switched cuz you were using final cut.
Like probably in like row eight or nine.
I don't know and it went through this.
Like transition where it got like worse.
Like simpler and a lot of people dropped.
It right around then that's when i was.
On premiere.
So i saw all that dropping and happening.
And i was like i don't really care.
Whatever and then it was actually the.
Kobe interview that i was doing with.
Another youtuber john tld and he was.
Shooting the behind the scenes video so.
We are literally like.
Next to each other both editing our.
Videos me the interview him the behind.
The scenes we both finished editing.
Around the same time i hit export in.
Premiere he had export and final cut his.
Video finished upload exporting he.
Watched him back found a mistake went.
Back fixed it finished exporting again.
Before he uploaded it i was out like 19%.
We went out to dinner came back it was.
That like 70% it eventually finished the.
Fans are cranking i finally get to.
Upload the video but that was when i was.
Convinced i should at least try final.
Cut because this isn't hilarious you.
Can't edit on my laptop you're the same.
Laptops.
Yeah well the footage so when you edit.
Like regular prores for k it's actually.
Yeah it'll it'll handle it pretty well.
But i've been editing this is a multicam.
Red project so this is three red raw.
Streams of 6k at the time that i was.
Trying to push through a laptop and it.
Was just not handling it well.
I traveled here with an imac pro because.
It's still really hard to edit red raw.
On a laptop i could get away with it if.
I was just shooting on like my canon or.
Whatever but that's been my challenges.
Raw do you feel like it's difficult.
Because you are known for tech i mean.
That's what you're known for if you feel.
That pressure of always having to stay.
At the top of your game quality wise and.
I mean you do have to people look to you.
Right you're the guy so do you feel that.
Pressure like man i can't stoop down to.
A lower quality and someone else or like.
This is so much more work but i have to.
Use the red yeah i i don't look at his.
Pressure as much as i actually want to.
Push the game to the next level right i.
Would love if red made like a smaller.
Camera with like the same color science.
And autofocus and i could take that.
Places because it would make my life.
Easier but when i watch back i've tried.
This i've gone to events with like just.
My rx100 or esr or whatever and i edit.
All the footage and i'm like i don't.
Like this as much this isn't as good.
Looking so something about my eye for it.
Is like the main reason why i want to.
Bring like the nice camera and deal with.
The extra work yeah it's cuz you.
Genuinely just want to do something.
Better yeah okay so do you have like a.
Team that helps you because i know you.
Answer emails yourself but yeah what.
Does your team look like yes so i have.
Three people working with me andrews my.
Full-time assistant and sort of like a.
Second pair of hands but he also.
Co-hosts the podcast and edits it and.
Then vin and brandon are the sort of.
Cinematography extra hands and they're.
Super talented in their own right but.
They'll do things like their behind the.
Camera when i'm on camera they do set.
Design they do motion graphics sound.
Design all that stuff so when i do like.
The main edit i can pass off clips to.
Them they can make that clip incredible.
And we bring it back in and we'll do.
Like a robot shot is what we call it.
Bring that back in and we sort of mix it.
All together and then i'll finish the.
Whole project she's still very hands-on.
In your process then definitely yeah and.
I sort of not struggled with that but.
I've thought a lot about like what if i.
Just gave them the whole edit and we've.
We tried that actually a couple times.
And every time we do that it feels great.
To not have to work as much because.
They're editing but i feel like the the.
Personal touch is lobby's you have to go.
Back in and change it's gonna take a lot.
Of time anyway yeah little things and i.
You know over time i'm sure we could.
Like hone that down for them to to.
Pretty much edit it exactly the way i.
Would but it definitely feels like i.
Should just keep doing the main edit and.
If you're not i mean you say you still.
Get excited by it so it's not like yet a.
Chore right yeah no i i know that the.
Edit is the most tedious part yeah but.
It is the most personal like execution.
And i think i think that's a similar.
Situation you and greg have to go.
Through right yeah yeah we still do that.
I've had to learn to i guess kind of i.
Was i was a lot worse i mean not alan if.
It's called worse i was very like not.
Perfectionist i just like things a.
Certain way and i was talking about.
Timing to point something of a second.
You know like it makes a big difference.
To me but i had to learn like okay i.
Know it bothers me but i know most.
People it's not all people don't even.
Realize this and i've tested that theory.
And it for the most part.
I know exactly what you're talking about.
I had to get okay with being like okay.
This is realistically for them on time.
That we have left to post this this is.
Enough yeah and it was it was it's a.
Tough thing to do and it hurts sometimes.
Yeah but i definitely know what you're.
Talking about have you gone back and.
Forth like you edit one and like you can.
See how the audience reacts versus.
Someone else who edited a video and oh.
For sure.
Yeah sure and it would just became a.
Thing of like the times that i really.
Care about something that's exciting and.
New yeah then i won't like budge on it.
Yeah if it's something that i'm like not.
That proud of that sounds bad i'm not.
Proud of stuff and then it's just like.
Well i this is enough you know what they.
Say to do like one for you one for them.
That's like a general rule but like you.
Can sort of go back and forth where like.
Some things are just you know we already.
Kind of have a basic idea of what this.
Is gonna be and so we can easily pass.
That off and then some of them are like.
Like more passion projects or whatever.
Gonna call it and then you end up i mean.
I recently liked one that you did a.
Video you made that didn't i didn't know.
You did that kind of video there wasn't.
A review it was just you um i don't.
Remember what exactly do i think you.
Just exported the same video like over.
And over i like this one i want to do.
More of that i think you should do i.
Like that video how did that do for you.
Though it was fine actually updated well.
I think it's because it ended up like a.
Fun video right i think the initial.
Performance of it was probably worse.
Because people are all used to like new.
Gadget new gadget tech new thing and.
Then what happens when you download and.
Read upload a video a thousand times or.
Like i don't know i guess i'll watch.
That later but once people watched it.
And start sharing it people like really.
Liked it i am i am the reason why i.
Thought that was great so you actually.
Did that then yeah i'm bloated yes so.
Egypt i was like the download button.
Inside of it so we uploaded this 8k.
Beautiful like 40 second file downloaded.
It and then uploaded that and they.
Downloaded that and uploaded that and we.
Did that a thousand times so what was.
Your internet bill like some people web.
Cap i'm like a fiber it was since it was.
Such a short file it wasn't so.
It was more of like the tedious someone.
Every all the comments are like why.
Didn't you just write a script to do it.
Which we were like oh i didn't know i.
Could yeah it turns out there's a limit.
Of like a hundred uploads a day and so.
Once you get to that limit you have to.
Like wait 24 hours to start again so.
That's at least 10 days of 100 uploads.
But then some of them it was andrew and.
Vin and i all trying to do this but like.
If you download a video and then upload.
It and then download that too fast it.
Was like not done processing so you.
Didn't get the full quality and then if.
You like didn't really check them for.
Like 50 and then you like look at it.
You're like why is this 480p and you go.
Back 50 and you realize you messed up.
You you lose those 50 towards the castle.
Is like a month project yeah exactly.
Worth it i thought that was one of the.
Best videos i've seen a long is good it.
Was just creative what do you use for.
Your camera to shoot with or do you.
Change it once in a while or yeah our.
Our main camera is a monster oh 8k this.
Division direct their names are pretty.
Weird now but it's a red camera and it's.
A huge nearly full-frame sensor which is.
Wild for video and then the image.
Processing pipeline just spits out a que.
Red raw with like 16 stops of dynamic.
Range or something crazy i could no.
Doubt about it forever but it's a that's.
The primary camera.
Well no autofocus huge file size is kind.
Of terrible to use but the image is so.
Nice that i'm willing to work with it.
And and sort of that i have that.
Pipeline pretty much down i mean for a.
Youtube video like you may be using.
Probably the best camera out of any.
Youtuber right that's not shooting film.
Right yeah it's kind of funny it's like.
I know another guy john who uses an ari.
Alexa mini one my friend judd nur who's.
Also from new jersey also uses a red.
Camera and it's something about the tech.
Crowd and maybe this is just because.
We've been leading the way and a lot of.
People are sort of copying it but for.
Whatever reason we just really like.
Crispy video and the better you can make.
It out it's kind of funny you've noticed.
Like if you watch a bunch of other tech.
Videos even from like cnet or the wall.
Street journal yep.
Suddenly all their videos.
Really cinematic in the past couple.
Years and that's because that's just the.
Look that's over kind of set this bar i.
Mean that's kind of like what you're.
Known for it to a certain degree right.
Like yes so i never really thought about.
Taking credit for it cuz there's sort of.
A group of us that are all sort of.
Pushing the envelope and doing different.
Things but like if i see a robot shot.
From one of them yeah i start right yeah.
Yeah uh you said there's a small group.
If you guys that do that yeah do you.
Guys have like a group chat where you.
Discuss all do you try to this this like.
Exchanging tricks and trades yeah we not.
A group chat but we all sort of it's.
Kind of funny at tech events because.
Like tech companies invite all the same.
People to all their events we sort of.
All collaborate and we'll chat at these.
Things so like ces every year we're all.
There but like when samsung comes out.
With a new phone they invite all of us.
So we're all there anyway so we all.
Talked there and then we're all at the.
Apple event we all talk there and a.
Motorola and like it just sort of.
Happens a lot during the year um but.
Yeah that's when we'll end up like just.
Talking about the techie tube world or.
Do you feel like sometimes because.
You're always hanging out together when.
You guys talk about things sometimes.
Their opinions influence you so almost.
Like it bleeds into your commentary.
Probably yeah and i think even just.
Watching other videos like i know my my.
Edit style has changed watching other.
People's videos like what you say about.
Like a point ii like 0.1 second.
Difference like if you watch a philip.
Defranco video you would know if the.
Edit style changed because like the.
Cadence would be off right and i don't.
Know how many people would notice if my.
Edit was a quarter of a second off but.
Like that's the sort of thing i'll like.
Sort of hone based on like watching my.
Own in other people's videos and i think.
That happens in a lot of things and in.
Tech and other genres too yeah well.
We're about at that halfway mark okay.
Cool i guess we'll do a quick.
Shishi break and this is something we.
Just started doing since yesterday but.
Do you have any things for our halftime.
Show that you want to perform any skills.
Anything you can do.
Can you sing i will drink more of this.
Water and do a bottle flip do it right.
Now but it's gonna take a while okay.
Music.
You actually have to do it yeah i don't.
Even have any crazy yeah.
Well then we'll be right back and we're.
Back sweet awesome so i wanted to ask.
You something about this cuz you know.
You're definitely a tech channel have.
You seen how like the youtubes peace.
Corps recently got leaked kind of i did.
See that i don't think i saw myself in.
That but i saw the articles but yeah and.
I was like definitely pushing tech and.
Gaming and stuff like that yeah is it.
Explicitly pushing tech uh it talked.
About that because that's like a great.
Consumer it's really that you can buy a.
Lot of right ad companies will probably.
Purchase into that area as well yeah uh.
And so i was just curious how if you.
Felt like oh like this is good for us or.
I feel like i've always sort of known.
That what we're in one of these genres.
That's like pretty clean for youtube.
Like i know a lot of people like the ad.
Pocalypse happens like a lot of certain.
Genres of channels were like really.
Struggling to deal with it and if you.
Watch any of my videos or any tech.
Videos basically they're all pretty much.
Like clean the the normal demographic is.
Awesome for youtube because it's like.
People who are unreachable anywhere else.
It's like 18 to 34 year old affluent.
Spending you know consumers that are.
Like ready they like like put our ad.
Dollars right there like it's perfect so.
Like i've always kind of known that's.
It's a good safe place on youtube and.
It's kind of a happy coincidence that i.
Happen to love tech but yeah it's been.
Pretty smooth sailing as far as dealing.
With youtube so how do you um do you.
Guys have to like look at algorithms.
Constantly that's your thing are you.
Kind of just like oh no we're clean so.
We know we're gonna be good yeah there's.
Still ways to play with algorithm.
Especially in the whole quantity over.
Quality game i think about that a lot.
And we make about a hundred videos a.
Year which is like one every three days.
Like twice a week something like that.
And i know for a fact because other.
Channels do this if i uploaded daily the.
Channel would do massively better on.
Paper it would get three times as many.
Views every month they.
Would get recommended in the algorithm.
There would be a bigger category a.
Bigger library of things to recommend.
But as far as sanity i don't think i can.
Like do that to myself so yeah we think.
About the algorithm a little bit but.
Generally a title thumbnail in the.
Description make a great video yeah yeah.
And uh just went with terminology i.
Forgot for audiences who don't know he's.
Like youtube's p scores basically like.
Their preferential score what type of.
Videos they'll suggest you and your.
Recommended in your sidebar stuff like.
That and as of a couple of days ago i.
Don't have you seen youtube's new ui in.
Terms of uploading stuff like that not.
Uploading i saw the new homepage mm.
Which is like much bigger thumbnails.
Which i don't hate because i've our.
Thumbnails are like kind of like made to.
Be really tiny like it when i do a.
Thumbnail of like a phone like there's.
Only so many angles you can show a phone.
Where if you shrink it down to that.
Postage stamp-sized you can even tell.
What it is so i kind of like the bigger.
Thumbnails but the new upload interface.
I haven't seen so what do you do when.
You're not making youtube videos i think.
A lot of people are pretty interested in.
Knowing what your life is like outside.
Of that to have like a girlfriend you.
Just hang out with your friends like or.
Is it just work work work and frisbee.
Frisbee yeah well i was gonna say is.
Like usually if i'm not at work it's.
Some ultimate related thing like.
Weekends for the most part on the east.
Coast when it's warm from like march.
When is getting warm to like september.
Which is nationals is ultimate frisbee.
Which is it's a lot because you have.
Practice during the week and then you.
Have games and tournaments on weekends.
But that's mostly what i'm doing when.
I'm not at work and that's like mainly.
The reason i'm i wouldn't i would go.
Insane if i didn't have some sort of.
Especially cuz like when you're a.
Youtuber people know nothing about this.
But you're like sitting down all day and.
Like i can't really sit down for more.
Than about three or four hours like i.
Hate cross-country flights because i.
Really just don't want to be sitting for.
That long so something about like i can.
Get through sitting and editing for five.
Straight hours because i know you have.
Practice tonight like.
We'll be the opposite wars exactly like.
Chomping at the bit trying to get out of.
That so i think that's like the the.
Balance of when i don't have to work.
That's that's where i'm at what is a so.
You said it's like games and tournaments.
Is it mostly tournament based your.
Season or how does because i've no no.
Idea yeah yeah yeah it's kind of complex.
And anytime i try to explain it i try to.
Simplify it basically club ultimate.
Which is like if you think of like club.
Soccer like area teams are that's like.
The main version of ultimate college.
Kids will join an area team people who.
Are graduating things like that i play.
For the new jersey area team now i play.
For the new york area team and those are.
All it's a better team yeah we came in.
30 nationals dan oh congrats thank you.
That just happened to you said september.
Yeah that was was it a month ago maybe.
He's a month ago no i don't how many.
Teams because nationals i think there.
Were 16 teams well and is it also kind.
Of like other sports we have to travel.
To another city to play yes yeah so so.
Yeah tournaments will be in various.
Cities around the u.s. so we had a.
Tournament in colorado this year.
Nationals is in san diego there's other.
Tournaments on both coasts generally but.
Anywhere you get like a huge field space.
That's like generally like minnesota and.
Is really popular with fields and and.
Certain states have much more fields.
Than others but it's tournament.
Basically you play like four games in a.
Day and hopefully you win but that's.
Your like your stress relief and.
Something you love doing yeah definitely.
Would you say that i guess let's say the.
Ultimate frisbee became the thing like.
It became like the next big thing right.
Well would you leave the tech industry.
And would you do that professionally if.
It paid off.
Paid away more than you know let's say.
You got a 20 million dollar contract to.
Be a frisbee player but you got to focus.
On playing frisbee can't make tech.
Videos anymore.
You could do it lebron vlogging yeah.
Your new hate comments be like dog get.
Back to the field.
Get that disk going dang uh wow i i.
Assume it's your stress relief right yes.
They don't want compact this they want.
Frisbee this exactly uh i never thought.
About that.
I guess yeah i guess i would you would.
Enjoy it more.
I would enjoy it but i think yeah my.
Offseason yeah like you know some sort.
Of creative outlet cuz i think i would.
Also go crazy right now if i never had.
Any creative outlet so i think they sort.
Of you know each other they keep each.
Other like in check or from overwhelming.
The other do you find that your fan base.
Cuz allow your stuff is educational so.
Like if someone's interest in something.
I would assume they type in something.
And they find you and they what they.
Learn and they'd like you or they don't.
And they trust you or whatever do you.
Find that your fans would care care more.
About you or care more about your.
Content i think the content but i think.
It helps to have a palatable personality.
Yeah i think there's a bunch of really.
Good examples of channels that are.
Successful because of their personality.
And like the audience is there for them.
Right and oh they're so relatable.
They're so funny they're so whatever and.
I think i sort of mentioned earlier but.
Like the best the easiest part of my job.
Is like i don't have to be the most.
Entertaining person personally i'm like.
Covering the tech and that's what people.
Care about and hopefully my coverage of.
The tech is also entertaining and that's.
Where we push the limits of like well.
That's why you have fans because they.
Like you doing it right just some random.
Person ever eat every week or every.
Three days doing it right yeah yeah.
There's a million places to get do you.
Think i mean i don't know if you have or.
Not but don't you think what if you did.
Something about you playing professional.
Frisbee you think they would care about.
You or do you think they would not like.
That because like what is this yeah i.
Think i have wanted to do that and i'm i.
Struggle to find the time to really give.
It the time it deserves i think any time.
We're playing i'm so that's the problem.
I'm so hyper focused on playing that i.
Would be like annoyed that i couldn't.
Give my attention to how it was being.
Recorded filmed i'd have to honestly.
Like take a season where i'm injured or.
Something so i'm up i don't like to not.
I'm not like worked like mad that i'm.
Not playing because i couldn't play so i.
Could focus on recording.
But like usually the entire season i'm.
Like focused on like peaking physically.
At the right time of year and like.
Eating right and like oh like everything.
I'm doing on the field is like for very.
Purpose built so like it's really hard.
To make something about that yeah yeah.
Using other people's footage so yeah.
With yeah i know what you mean yeah i.
Would i would like to do that though and.
You'd have to like get people to sign.
Like release forms exactly.
But on the off season though what do you.
Do that's sure right now is the off.
Season it's a lot of just like working.
Out boring staring at a wall biking like.
It's it's not as exciting we do have.
Like some winter leagues that you can.
Play in in new jersey which is a lot of.
Like weekday night stuff randomly but i.
Do enjoy like having random time i i.
Took a day the other day and i just.
Played 2k for like i think the entire.
Day because it sunsets at like 4 o'clock.
And i think from like from like 10 a.m.
To like 4 o'clock i just played 2k 2.
Whole day cuz i hadn't gotten 2k 20 yet.
So i had to like get in get in the.
Storyline yeah yeah i usually get 2k.
Every year like right when it comes out.
Same and this year i slacked a little.
Bit and i didn't get to it until after.
Nationals.
Mm-hm and so i just got into it i got a.
Question i mean a shift modes a little.
Bit get a little more deep sure go ahead.
What like so you know you're obviously.
Very very successful you've interviewed.
Some of the leaders of the world right.
In technology and science and you've.
Been you know oliver on every.
Publication and whatnot and you're.
You're doing this thing that you really.
Enjoy right what what is what's driving.
That like what is it like you do have.
Like a purpose or like a reason for.
Doing this i know it's very deep but but.
I'm curious because you know that it's.
Obvious that a lot of people are super.
Drawn to your personality right even.
Though it may be something that's you're.
Just reviewing products right something.
Technical technology but but you know.
Seems like you had a really good.
Upbringing and you seem like a very you.
Know likeable.
And i'm just wondering like what is.
Driving you to like what's your end goal.
Like what are you trying to accomplish.
Just i know it's not just you know.
You're not just trying to review.
Products like there's yeah there must be.
Something there i think the the way it.
All started was i wanted to make videos.
That i would want to watch so it sort of.
It was like created from i wanted to.
Create something that i wanted to exist.
In the world and i sort of started to.
Pivot it but stopped because it was way.
Too much into creating like a website.
Where you could just like look up a.
Product and just like see if you should.
Buy it or not and i whether that was a.
Video or like some collection of videos.
Or some information or comparison or.
Whatever it was you could just find it.
Decide if you wanted to buy or not and i.
Think like the videos that i make are.
Like kind of the next best thing it's.
Like i think of a product i wonder if.
It's any good i'm just curious about it.
Generally or some topic i wonder what.
Happens when i upload a thousand times.
And download it upload it again and i'll.
Just go search it up find it and boom up.
Here's the best possible comprehensive.
Video about what i wanted to see that's.
Just kind of basically what it's based.
Around you know it's i guess it's.
Nothing too deep as far as like what is.
My purpose what i what i want to do with.
His time i feel like it's it's mainly.
Just creating what i want to exist and.
Making it better as we go it seems like.
You're on a quest the way i see it at.
Least from this explanation just love it.
I see it as a quest to create the best.
Library of reviews for any particular.
Phone or you know gadgets yeah yeah yeah.
It kind of has end up ended up being.
That and i think the like branching out.
Into other types of videos is the more.
Fun part that i want to do more and so.
Maybe it's less of a catalog of products.
And more of a catalog of entertainment.
But tech happens to be the common thread.
That goes through it we're doing a retro.
Tech series that starts premiering in.
December or it's like obviously no one's.
Buying these products anymore they're.
All gonna be you know 20 30 40 year-old.
Iconic pieces of tech but it's like the.
Aryans of diving back into what made.
Them iconic it's just sort of.
Entertainment instead of like product.
Based stuff yeah so yeah it's just a.
Lesson in history yeah yeah exactly and.
Still tech related some people aren't.
Good don't give you the past it's not.
Your usual stuff but it's still related.
Yeah common thread right yeah so we do.
Have some questions from fans here oh.
Boy.
Many many questions yeah i got a.
Question first okay for that i love it.
Because like you said i like what you.
Said palatable personality sure what is.
The weirdest band interaction you've had.
Though we're just fan interaction.
Because i'm sure you're so likable that.
They just come up and they're like i.
Know you.
I'm just right into it you're right that.
Like when people come up to me they they.
It's a it's a power a social.
Relationship everyone knows everything.
Already about you and you don't really.
Know them so it's kind of one-sided at.
First but on one hand that actually does.
Produce a lot of like fun like.
Interactions i on my way here as i was.
Getting into the uber lady walking by.
Didn't even like do anything she just.
Walked by and went i really liked your.
Youtube videos and then just kept.
Walking i was nice but yeah weird.
Weirdest fan interactions i'm trying to.
Think of like because i'm sure you have.
To be at a lot of conventions stuff like.
Yeah well here's the thing about a tech.
Audience is a lot of nerds like me don't.
Go out too much or whatever so when we.
Get to like a tech convention imagine.
Filling a hall with all these people who.
Like are used to being like just on the.
Computer and now they're just sort of.
Checking out tech so it's sort of a like.
Everyone that comes up to me will have.
Like a different way of trying to.
Explain that they know who i am but it's.
Usually pretty awkward it'll be either.
Like oh my daughter knows who you are.
Youtube right or they'll like say 410.
They don't know i like i like the.
Everyone says in the acronym wrong i was.
Walking through the airport and someone.
Said mkb d or something like they just.
Said the.
Letters and i was like yeah that's me.
Not really but yeah everyone's got a.
Different way i noticed stuff like just.
Saying nothing too crazy nothing yeah.
Nothing like no crazy i don't want to.
Like jinx it but nothing like stalkerish.
Or anything wild because your audience.
Is a little more mature yeah they're all.
At home alright so we have a question.
Here from three number three do you ever.
Want to produce or create your own tech.
Yeah that's a big challenge like a big.
Undertaking i've thought about and this.
Is come up before like why don't you.
Make yeah so much to say about phones.
Why don't you make your own phone it's.
Like well okay you need you need like a.
Manufacturing process you need to.
Basically partner with an entire.
Smartphone company.
The thing about partnering with a.
Smartphone company when you have to.
Objectively review smart phones is that.
Compromises your relationship with at.
Least that company's products forever if.
Not the rest of those products so it.
Seems like that might be like an end.
Game like when i'm 50 i'd be like.
Alright i'm done making videos i'm gonna.
Make the perfect phone and i'm out of.
Here or when your professional ultimate.
Blair yeah i'm your sponsor yeah by your.
Own bone exactly and then the logos on.
The jersey is perfect yeah.
What this is actually mike my question i.
You know everybody knows that you are a.
Fan of tesla yeah you drive a tesla what.
Do you think about the future of tesla.
And what their automobiles like where.
They're headed right now like do you.
Think they're headed in the right.
Direction.
Yeah whenever i look at tesla and i.
Compare it to i try to stay objective.
Like i'm obviously fan of tesla but i.
Look around at other electric cars and.
Every time i look around tesla is miles.
Ahead in so many ways as far as electric.
Cars and i think we're just now getting.
To the point where there is legitimate.
Competition to a couple of their models.
The porsche ty can seems like one of.
Them but it's still more of a driver's.
Car versus the everyday like the model 3.
When you're out here it's everywhere.
Basically so they're kind of on a great.
Path i i was talking to someone recently.
About a potentially unique way for.
To exist which is just for them to sell.
Parts like they have the gigafactory.
And they have such great drivetrain.
Technology they could sell electric.
Drivetrains cell batteries and then kind.
Of like google just sell one car like a.
Model s and model 3 but still the rest.
Of those parts to make everyone else's.
Electric cars better the way google.
License is android mm-hmm so there's an.
Android phone from samsung from motorola.
From huawei from xiaomi they can all use.
That to make their phone better so they.
Don't have to build their own os because.
Right now ford doesn't really make great.
Electric drivetrain toyota doesn't i.
Mean i have a hybrid but they don't make.
Their own great electric drivetrain so.
If they just partnered up with tesla and.
Use the supercharger network they'd.
Already have a much better car so i was.
Thinking about it in that unique way.
Recently and i think that could be.
Pretty cool but as it right now i just.
Want the roadster.
It's supposed to be 2020 but also for.
Sure delete oh all right next question.
Here from joseph liu.
What does mobile tech look like in the.
Future oh man if i knew i think also i.
Struggle with being maybe a little bit.
Short-sighted because people make these.
Like crazy renders of like oh it'll be a.
Hologram that comes up out of your i.
Don't know maybe i just think like we'll.
Always have like ice and smartphones as.
Just like this object that you like pick.
Up use and put away and so on when we.
Get these like wearables and like i just.
Broke out google glass again for like.
The first time in years and i'm like.
Trying to understand like maybe vr is.
The future maybe ar.
But i don't quite see it yeah and i just.
I go back to like well if we can make.
Phones better that'll be the future yeah.
So uh maybe i'm sure it's sighted but i.
Feel like i just look at smart phones.
The smaller phones aren't going away not.
Anytime soon.
Mm-hmm yeah i have a question actually.
So yeah rewind we talked a little brief.
About it but i touched on that yeah and.
I feel like you kind of got thrown into.
It yeah hard because you were like that.
First big line sure yeah did you do you.
Feel the brunt of the hate yeah you.
Almost like a face of it that's why yeah.
I don't know if you know it was funny.
What on the face but he was one of the.
Biggest yeah yeah yeah it it i i don't.
Think i got that much hate for it.
I think the memes in the comments were.
Relentless for like three months.
Mmm-hmm but as far as my involvement in.
It like i kind of told my story and i.
Made a video about it but like we all.
Thought rewind was gonna be this.
Different thing this year i don't know.
If you got like that email that was like.
This is the first year everyone's gonna.
Feature creator voices and we've.
Narrowed it down to 50 creators instead.
Of 350 and i was like oh this is gonna.
Be different and then we did this shoot.
And in the shoot the producers are all.
Telling us the same stuff like it's.
Gonna be great we did multiple takes of.
Different lines everyone gets a close-up.
Shot we're like wow this is different.
And then you watch the video like this.
Is not different this is the same thing.
So yeah it was like i don't feel like i.
Got thrown into it as much as i just i.
Along with everyone else involved didn't.
Have any control over the final product.
And it just kind of happened mm-hm.
Hopefully this year is better if they.
Even do a rewind this is sure they will.
Think you're doing something yeah so.
There's another question here i'm from.
Hot sure whoring your reviews are now.
Quoted by the biggest companies in the.
World has that kind of pressure changed.
How you approach reviews in any way and.
It's it's i mean i would think that you.
Know when you're making these reviews.
Some of the biggest publications may.
Also quote you right i mean do you feel.
That pressure or is it just just don't.
Think about that at all uh at most i.
Think maybe it might like make might.
Tempt me to use more quotable language.
Hmm but as far as like how i actually.
Talk about the product i don't think it.
Changes anything at all i think even.
Since like the the beginning day is.
Eight nine years ago i got a tell like.
It is like if a products bad i'm gonna.
Tell you exactly why it's bad but the.
Good thing about that is a company who.
Makes that product when you put out a.
Review and say something's bad like.
Let's say the battery life for the.
Camera or whatever it's bad the fact.
That i'm telling the truth about it.
Helps them to either improve it they can.
Do a software update or to make a better.
One the next time and if no one told.
Them it was bad they kind of wouldn't.
Know like they put out a product the.
Best they can and hope for the best and.
Turns out the battery's bad no one wants.
It good to know make the next one bigger.
Battery but if they don't get this.
Useful valuable feedback about why.
Something's bad it won't help the.
Consumer a good example of that was i'll.
Go back to when i was in college i.
Reviewed a motorola phone and i'd worked.
With him a bunch and the phone came out.
And i reviewed it and i went to the the.
Specs and i was talking about the camera.
About how like this is the worst part of.
The phone if they only made the camera.
Better this would be a great phone and i.
Showed all these example photos and i.
Reached out and i sent them a bunch of.
Sample images i was pointing at circling.
Stuff in the videos like here's where.
The coherent hertz here's where dynamic.
Range would've been better and there was.
Software update like within weeks.
Specifically addressing what i had asked.
About and sure enough like months later.
People are talking about what this this.
Phones cameras gotten better that's.
Pretty good for them so that and i'm.
Sure the next phone had a better camera.
Too so thanks to you i think we all win.
Yeah when reviewers do their job what so.
This is my personal question um what.
What was the most exciting review that.
You ever made what was the worst review.
That you felt pain to have to make this.
Review okay and then yeah i guess those.
Two okay exciting review i don't know if.
It even counts as a review but i got to.
Make it i've started this autofocus.
Video series pretty recently where we.
Talk about car tech which lets me review.
Cars we're like five six episodes in but.
I've already i was given a mclaren 720's.
For a week and easy we we shot it in.
Like december and it was impossibly cold.
Like every time we had to lean out a car.
Window to get a shot it was like the.
Camera would start to like freeze up and.
We'd have to take it back in like it was.
Really hard to shoot but that was the.
Most exciting product i think i've ever.
Had damn you're upgrading man yeah.
They're like hey here's our car our new.
Car the road out well that's every boxes.
It's already a thing there is already.
There's automotive journalists who kind.
Of do this already they regularly.
Receive cars to review and i know they.
Have like press cars that like go around.
The country when i did the tesla video.
That was a press car they don't do it.
Very often but mclaren toyota whoever.
They have a fleet of cars that they will.
Give to press for a couple days and get.
Take back so it's already a market that.
You can get into if you want i just had.
Never done car videos and i don't know a.
Lot about cars but as soon as i got my.
Car i was like oh i love cars so i got.
Started to get into that but yeah that's.
That was pretty exciting most painful.
Yeah so the one that comes to mind was.
Last year i reviewed the red hydrogen.
And i don't know if you heard about this.
What red makes great cameras and they've.
Been in hollywood they have the best.
Color science i love my red cameras so.
Red or last year about two years ago it.
Started hyping that they're gonna make a.
Smart phone oh that's gonna be a smart.
Phone okay it's gonna have like the best.
Camera in any phone right this is right.
Around the time when smartphone cameras.
Are getting really good reds gonna get.
In the game they're gonna change the.
Game all right i'm ready i'm ready for.
The red smartphone they were taking a.
While to make it there was all this hype.
Building up and you could kind of tell.
That this was red not knowing how to.
Make a phone really like every time i'd.
Ask them for an update about it they'd.
Be like oh we're we're doing carrier.
Certifications so we're it's we're it's.
Too late a little bit but it's gonna be.
Great don't worry i was like i'm ready.
Any time i'm ready and i made a video.
Actually or they they gave me a world.
Exclusive first look at like one of.
Their first prototypes so people got.
What what the design would look like and.
So i'm everyone's ready for the phone.
Super excited for it it finally comes.
Out and when it comes out first of all.
The parts are so old because they've.
Been working on it for two straight.
Years it had like a two year old cpu the.
Camera was an off-the-shelf sony sensor.
With really not great photo quality.
Didn't do high quality video which it's.
Made by readwrite of all headings that.
Should be good exact.
It had a really big battery but like.
That it was a thick phone like it it had.
One of the worst screens of any phone.
Where they were claiming it could do.
Like 3d really well but if you turn the.
3d mode off the actual display was like.
Not nice so all these things flopped.
Fill hard on their faces and so my.
Review of the phone was like i wanted.
This to be good so bad but it was a one.
Maya my i do smartphone worth at the end.
Of every year it won my worst phone of.
The year award i get a little there they.
Did not ask for their trophy some of the.
Other companies asked for them they did.
Not want this yeah i mean i guess that.
Shows i go with show you you're honest.
You know like i mean you love the brand.
But you had to be honest so exactly and.
I've been i went on and bought one of.
Their cameras last week so okay that's.
