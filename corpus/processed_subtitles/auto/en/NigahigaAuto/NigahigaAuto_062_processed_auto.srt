Through my videos and i don't think i.
Actually have so i'm gonna do this one.
This scar look how big this scar is.
Right here and a scar right here.
Actually i was getting attacked by.
Ninjas one day and i'm not even gonna.
Bother this is a true story a story i'm.
Necessarily proud of when i was 6 years.
Old i was in the first grade i remember.
I was riding my bike with a bunch of my.
Neighborhood friends you know at the.
Time there was this stunt daredevil guy.
Called evel knievel you guys don't know.
Who he is he did a bunch of crazy stunts.
On his motorcycle and basically i wanted.
To be him i thought that was like the.
Coolest thing in the world there was a.
Few of my neighborhood friends and we're.
All riding our bike on my street there's.
This gigantic ditch she about a six foot.
Six and a half foot drop and i don't.
Know where i rode my bike straight.
Towards the ditch tried to lift up the.
Handlebars try and do a backflip and.
Land but it did not quite go that way so.
Instead i did kind of like a half.
Backflip and halfway through towards the.
End i was like oh my god i'm gonna fall.
Instead of bailing i turned sideways and.
Basically i landed exactly on this arm.
And completely broke my arm.
I got it casted and apparently i don't.
Know something went wrong with the.
Casting so the time i was high school.
Kept having these wrist issues like.
Every time i just bent it a little it.
Started to hurt when i got x-ray tyria.
They realized that you know from that.
First injury an arm got messed up what.
They had to do this because his mom was.
Longer what they had to do is they had.
To cut all the way through the bone and.
Take out a chunk of bone to make this.
Bone shorter that's why there's big.
Slices there and then what they did is.
They went in and they attached a metal.
Rod to the two bones so that the bones.
Would heal properly and then they put.
Another metal rod in here you know i had.
Metal in my arm for like a like two.
Years some metal actually still in there.
But actually really self-conscious about.
This i used to always like wanna wear.
Long sleeve shirts nothing you can do.
About it's like it couldn't it could be.
Worse you could have a scar and your.
Frickin nose dear ryan go to hell and.
Kill yourself wait you want me to go to.
Hell first and then kill myself it.
Doesn't make any sense do you even do.
That as if you're in hell you're already.
Dead can you even kill yourself in hell.
There's no way you can go to hell if.
You're still alive that doesn't make any.
Sense unless oh my god this is hell.
Jesse though dear i make a freestyle rap.
Um i don't know how to do that my.
Rapping is basically fifth-grader poetry.
I just look for words that rhyme as fast.
As i can and then i just even if it.
Doesn't make sense i'll just say it.
That's how i freestyle but i'm just.
Gonna go for it ah yo i'm sitting right.
Here doing this dear ryan call me mgm.
Cuz i'm a straight lyin to you when i.
Say that i'm making this up i got all of.
The lyrics written out on the back of.
This cup i'm just kidding there's.
Nothing really on there in fact i.
Already did this dear ryan i don't even.
Know why it's still here i'll tell you.
Why cuz i'm lazy i'm a bit crazy when i.
Open my eyes big you got some flowers i.
Got daisies that made no sense a penny.
For your thoughts.
Cuz i need to buy time now dot dot dot.

And condensation on a scale from 1 to 10.
Ign rates a 10 out of 10 and for all.
