Otherwise but what did you say he.
Okay you got it.
It just doesn't it just i don't know i.
Don't know i mean actually don't even.
I'd never know how to say anthony's last.
Name either yeah it's alright you don't.
Mention talking okay no more dude i.
Don't think so yeah i mean where we grew.
Up a lot of people said his last name.
Wrong as well padilla yeah okay but it's.
Padilha it's padilla is it really yeah.
It's like spanish this way right yeah.
Like kiss idea i thought it work at taco.
Bell and i would hate when people say.
Casa dilla i just say that i've gotten.
Out but slide it you mean quesadilla.
Polly you're one of those i'm a douche.
Bag taco bell the truly authentic.
Mexican experience yes yes so well it's.
Great to have you man it's been a while.
It has been last time i saw you we were.
Getting korean barbecue and wasn't it.
That burger spot no like where you live.
Oh it was okay what was that spot.
Super-good yeah then why i don't think.
We should do yet i literally live above.
Burger place uh-huh place is so good.
Okay don't don't ever mention where then.
Okay well fine but i will say though.
That they have a burger where they put a.
Slice of flaming yon in the burger oh.
Like on top of the regular patty i could.
Give him more i know.
Just keep give him more hands what is a.
Street name rhyme way so we can find.
This burger spot not your place you know.
This burgers but i don't even know okay.
Google maps tells me where to go and.
I'll just go alright you someone who.
Uses google maps or ways actually oh.
Google maps for sure well yeah cuz i.
Mean like the ui on waze is the grossest.
Thing i've ever seen you're a infection.
Yeah oh yeah come on man actually what.
Is ui i don't know user interface got it.
So mark it's just it just looks really.
Ugly and there's a lot of like logos and.
Stuff and i've never i've never actually.
Used it ever i've seen other people use.
It and so you're gonna call it ugly and.
Never use it you know i am one of those.
But also they they make some pretty.
Crazy recommendations like they'll have.
You do a left turn across like six lanes.
Of traffic and i mean yeah you can do.
That but i get crazy anxiety over that.
Kind of stuff because i don't want to i.
Don't want to edge out and then block.
Other people because i don't want to.
Inconvenience other people so i i'm.
Always trying to be as like considerate.
Described especially for an la driver i.
Know it's not a good pairing i always.
Say though that la drivers although they.
You know have a reputation to be very.
Aggressive and whatnot they're one of.
The you got to be a really good driver.
In la yet right yeah i think that that's.
The strange thing about la is they breed.
Really good drivers like not nice.
Drivers know they it's arrogant they're.
Arrogant drivers because they they see a.
Space that the car can fit into in.
Traffic and i'm just gonna wedge right.
In there and yeah your car can fit there.
But you could also cause somebody to.
Freak out and crash into you but it's.
Really funny whenever i go back to.
Sacramento because the difference in.
Drivers of la and sacramento while still.
In cal.
For nia is night and day because people.
In sacramento are nice but also.
Completely clueless like whenever i go.
Up there i always find somebody that's.
Just not looking they just start merging.
Into my lane i'm like hey hey.
So yeah la is not ellie's not that bad.
See in hilo in hawaii we don't even have.
That many lanes so you don't have to.
Worry about that but people also don't.
Drive over i would say forty miles an.
Hour yeah it's terrible it's terrible.
Driving back home and actually oahu is.
Pretty bad it's kind of like la have you.
Been there have you driven there it's.
Pretty low it's slow yeah but the lanes.
Are so narrow and like it's i mean.
That's one of the reasons i actually.
Don't like ahoo as much and la is.
Literally a traffic just makes me upset.
Yeah i'm one of those people yeah one.
Who is it oh wahoo was interesting.
Not my favorite not my favorite of the.
Islands we're out where else have you.
I'm like humble bragging well i went.
It's really funny the first time i went.
To hawaii we went to the big island.
You're your town we didn't go to hilo.
Though but went there with my parents.
And anthony it was like there it was.
Like our graduation gift i think.
And they took anthony along as well but.
When you go on vacation with your.
Parents it's kind of i mean like it.
Doesn't matter where you go it's kind of.
Lame because you have to do whatever.
They want to do right and also you know.
We were 18 i was i was still 17 and you.
Know you can't drink at that time.
There's so much you can do there yes.
General yeah yeah well i saw some sea.
Turtles that was pretty dope okay yeah.
So you know that we went to the volcano.
That was that was like you know it's a.
Big bed right now it's a little more.
Interesting now a little more lit really.
Now it was cool maui was like the sort.
Of cross between kauai and oahu i would.
Say mm-hmm where it's like it is.
Touristy but you still can get out yeah.
And then there's like the if you want to.
Talk about narrow roads the the road to.
Hana oh yeah dude well that that's the.
Rope did you have a renter you're not.
Supposed to go on that road.
We have a jeep oh yeah i don't think.
You're supposed to go there in a rental.
Yeah it's crazy like it's dangerous dude.
Yeah well they have i know that i saw a.
Shirt that you could buy there and said.
I survived the road to hana because it's.
Essentially most the time it's a.
One-lane road and the locals bombed that.
Road and there's bridges that are only.
Wide enough for like one car uh-huh and.
And so you know you see somebody coming.
The other way you better get the hell.
Out of their way and like drive into a.
Ditch they'll just run they'll just run.
You off the road yeah nuts it builds.
Character.
Yeah and then um and then kawaii oh is.
My favorite island like especially.
Living in la where you know you don't.
See a lot of green mm-hmm and the green.
That is there is just kind of like brown.
Green and then you go to kawaii and like.
Everything it's like somebody turned the.
Contrast up in your eyes like just i.
Couldn't comprehend the greenness of.
Everything and then a wahoo's like all.
Right there's a lot of tourists here if.
There's there's a lot of there's a lot.
There's a lot of people in general yeah.
Well did you find that um i don't know i.
Always ask people this especially if.
They're white did you experience any.
Racism there because believe it or not i.
Don't know if people know this but in.
Hawaii white people i from what i seen.
Experience the most racism which i know.
A lot of people argue that you can't be.
Racist to white person and i don't agree.
With that argument but i don't know i.
Growing up i've just i've seen the most.
Racism directed towards white people and.
Especially tourists i understand why.
I've heard i always heard about the.
Racism towards white people there which.
Honestly i understand mm-hmm i mean did.
You experience how they don't belong.
Locals i did i never i don't think i.
Ever really experienced anything.
Firsthand i haven't really experienced.
Anyone ever be rude to me from another.
Country i had one guy when i was in when.
I was in paris i had this one guy that.
Music.
I asked him if he spoke english in.
French because i don't that was.
Basically the only french word that i.
Knew and and he was like stem of d james.
Was that his food how about now maybe.
Yeah but i mean that's the rudest.
Anyone's ever been to me in any country.
I think as long as you respect everybody.
Right then they'll show you equal amount.
Of respect unless they're just having a.
Really bad day you're just a nice guy.
You know you don't in traffic you let.
People go like maybe that's why i don't.
Know well in my experience i've i mean.
Paco knows to like naturally i get it.
Makes sense you know i mean the islands.
Were illegally taken over right so.
There's always that you know there's a.
Negativity there but um it's especially.
Towards tourists i feel like people.
Don't it doesn't matter how polite.
Naturally a lot of like local people.
Don't like tourists and is there cuz i.
Know i think i mean i've heard that like.
In hawaii like there's there's even.
There's more racism against like.
Filipinos there oh no i'd say with uh i.
Guess minorities in america mmm in.
Hawaii there's equal racism to everyone.
Because it's such a melting pot yeah.
Like it's kind of like nobody really has.
Claimed like like up full claim cuz.
You're yeah you're you you have you're.
You're like japanese yeah i think.
There's everything yeah i think it's the.
Only state with no majority so everyone.
Is a minority there yeah and so everyone.
And it's just like everyone is equally.
Racist to each other and it's just it's.
Except yeah but it's almost like less of.
A problem like you but don't take racism.
As seriously there yeah i think at least.
Growing up because it's like everybody's.
Different yeah.
And like a lot of mix too so it's like.
The races racist comments and stuff it's.
Just like it's mostly stereotypes there.
Are jokes most of the time yeah so.
Everyone knew a little oh yeah anything.
Yeah it's a little different but like i.
Said to me i still think the white.
People got it the worst there well i.
Mean i get it because we're the most.
We're probably the most recent invaders.
Of hawaii right you know so i get it and.
There's a lot of money coming in there.
People you know.
A bunch of people from mainland america.
Saying oh actually i loved i'd love to.
Live there i'm just gonna bring all my.
Money i'm gonna buy this big house and.
I'm just gonna drive around in my.
Mercedes i'm just gonna buy everything.
That i was at rich people sound like to.
You.
Well there was actually a couple of.
Months ago though but this i guess.
Caucasian female said i moved to hawaii.
A year ago fell in love with the place.
And had like this whole like video on.
Twitter of how like oh you know i'm.
Exactly what you how you're describing.
He's doing this and a lot of people took.
It and said you didn't fall in love with.
Hawaii like you fell in love with being.
Able to vacation the whole time and.
Experience like all this stuff while.
Actual whole way and the people are very.
Different from what you're showing yeah.
100% yeah and that's and that's that.
Disconnect and you got it you got to.
Really respect the people that are.
Already living there if you're ever.
Going to move to another place you have.
To show that respect and understanding.
Of the people that were there before you.
Because then that happens and you look.
Like an idiot we should sell just that.
Clip right there.
You like the tourism board oh you're.
Saying everything right right now okay.
Well that makes sense that people were.
Nice to you so you and you went with.
Anthony yeah this is okay what what year.
Was that because you graduated 2005 so.
We went in 2005 okay.
Yes a bit yeah i'm an old man.
No i they're like four years older than.
Us ruff three three or four years always.
Like we're all the same age they were on.
Youtube from the very beginning yeah oh.
Five right i mean it first came out so.
Yeah and they were in uh you guys were.
In high school yeah well no we we just.
Graduated so it was the summer between.
High school and our super prestigious.
Community college yeah that's funny you.
Went to the big island the year that i.
Started youtube actually you're welcome.
Yeah yes you heavily must have.
Influenced you heavily influenced me and.
Actually i mean that's true story i mean.
I used to watch your guys stuff all the.
Time i mean i told you when i when we.
First.
Like we used to watch you and i mean you.
Guys were my favorite and like derrick.
Comedy yeah a lot of people don't know.
But that's childish game you know god i.
Can't even aim yeah that was the out you.
Guys were my favorites to watch back.
Then and i think about tamiya brats and.
Beretta exactly they started working.
With you guys.
Right yeah joe joe worked with us for.
Probably three or no probably four years.
And then and then luke luke barats also.
Did some work for us as well right right.
I got those guys are funny they're.
Amazing yeah they're super underrated.
They're both really talented joe bereta.
Went off to do a alley folk.
Yeah the valley folk it's separate.
Channel with some of the other people.
That he met through sourcefed uh-huh.
Yeah and all right so i guess going into.
The first twitter question since we're.
Talking about this which is going to.
Twitter already i mean i kind of want to.
Talk about it because they just.
Presented itself in such a natural and.
Organic way go ahead masha xk asks when.
I was in elementary school it was a.
Controversial topic who is better smosh.
Or nigahiga so have you folks ever felt.
Competition between each other i mean.
Not competition in in like a angry sort.
Of way but back in the day well this is.
A podcast you can be real if you were.
Like who is this no way.
No because like like ryan said he was a.
Fan of our stuff we were a fan of.
Nigahiga as well and like back back in.
That time there was so little content.
Yeah everybody knew everybody and.
Whenever you met another person like we.
Met at vidcon for the know you do some.
Youtube live right oh my god remember.
That yeah youtube live soldier boy katy.
Perry yeah i forgot you were there yeah.
That's where i met everybody and bo.
Burnham yeah like i met everybody there.
I even met kev there for the first time.
I mean we talked obviously but i think i.
Met cab for the first time there too.
Yeah people don't know about you to live.
Dude i literally i think i just talked.
About youtube live in our in our second.
Podcast and i was talking about how i.
Met bo burnham on the elevator and i did.
Recognize him because he's so damn tall.
Huge and in his old videos he'd play.
With a keyboard on his lap yeah and he.
Had this giant keyboard so i just.
Thought he was like an average size or.
Small-time person - he's a giraffe he's.
Gigantic.
He's super tall yeah also a super.
Talented guy i like - yeah um but yeah.
That was the that was the first time we.
Met and i again like like you were.
Saying everybody used to be very.
Supportive of each other we used to have.
Those youtube meetups even like random.
Ones like not even orchestrated by a.
Company or anything we just like there'd.
Be a spot and i mean i could barely go.
To any cuz i was in hawaii yeah there.
Was a lot that um people just meet up.
And hang out you know yeah that was he.
Had somebody did a big meetup in san.
Francisco i forget what it was called.
But do you member smp films yes yes yeah.
That was the first time that a lot of.
People met each other and it was in san.
Francisco and anthony and i drove out.
There and we just hung out at the pier.
And they're just like fans of various.
Channels philip defranco was there i'm.
Still was sexy food yeah that's like.
That weird thing you like bring up you.
Like oh yeah his channel used to be.
Called sexy feel they would think like.
Refer to him as that in my head.
I still think i don't think philip.
Defranco i think sexy phil yes yeah for.
This day i mean i wouldn't say that.
There is there was a sort of strong.
Competition but back in that day there.
Was there was a competition to get into.
Spots on the page and there would be yes.
Most viewed and most commented ever did.
Most favorited so so there were a couple.
Times when when we both uploaded it like.
The same time it's like ya know.
Especially if it's a video that you.
Really like - yeah or if it was like a.
Hot topic and then one of whoever was.
Releasing that topic first is like.
Dammit not people gonna think i copied.
Them but like there's no way we could.
Have made that in time you know but yeah.
There other than that i mean like people.
Were more we're closer before i think.
Cuz the community was so small i mean it.
Youtube was all about collaboration.
Until about i'd say four years ago.
Mm-hmm i remember the first the first.
Time that i ever experienced like.
Youtube drama directed at me was like a.
Channel that was that was talking crap.
About smosh the movie and it had just.
Came out so i was i was really proud of.
Like you know the fact that we were able.
To make a movie i didn't think it was.
Like a masterpiece but i was like well.
You know this is this is a sort of step.
Forward for you know youtube creators.
Getting into other sort of venues and.
And this one guy like made this very.
Like scathing review and i got so i got.
So hurt by it because i'm like this is.
Another creator and he's tearing another.
Creator down right and and i was so used.
To before that being everybody was.
Helping each other raising each other up.
And so that was my first experience with.
Somebody.
Tearing another creator down and then it.
Turned out that it's actually really.
Lucrative to tear other people.
Especially now yeah yeah i mean it.
Drives interests i mean ya can't there's.
No doubt about that i saw a tweet.
Recently by a keemstar i don't know his.
Real name.
Keemstar that's not illegally first name.
Kiemce yeah they don't know what star a.
Star last name drama he just said.
Somebody tweeted at him like oh stop why.
Do you keep mentioning jake paul so much.
Like it would be nice if you didn't have.
To mention him every video and he.
Tweeted back he's like well i mean he's.
Made me like two million dollars this.
Year so like if you wanna give me three.
Then i'll be happy to not mention it so.
Like and that's just him reporting on.
Drama not even being a part of it.
Technically yeah so i mean it it works.
And it does drive interest because when.
Things go down i mean like even for me.
I'm not gonna lie i'm interested to see.
Like okay what did someone do now yeah.
Yeah i remember the first time i heard.
About about drama alert i was like i was.
That some kind of it was like a charity.
Livestream some youtubers were putting.
On and this guy was like yeah like.
There's this guy keemstar and like i.
Don't feel good watching his stuff but i.
Can't stop.
I was like oh interesting so i went.
Checked it out and then yeah it just.
Kept getting bigger and bigger and.
Bigger yeah and i feel like you know the.
The i feel like the real breakout with.
Youtube drama was leafy oh right there.
Was that moment when leafy got really.
Really huge.
You know tearing into people.
Unfortunately a lot of times they were.
Children yeah which isn't very cool i.
Mean like i certainly didn't said some.
Pretty stupid things when i was a little.
Kid and i wouldn't want to be crash site.
Criticized for it you know.
And then i mean because he was the first.
One and it got really big youtube you.
Know basically cracked down on him.
And destroyed his channel mm-hmm yeah.
And um that's where we are today folks.
Yeah i don't know how we got there but.
We were talking about how we were.
Competitive and it ends up now we're.
Just watching drama youtubers i guess.
Well i guess from you because we got his.
Perspective so from your perspective did.
You ever feel like oh this is.
Competition even though like like ian.
Seems like a very like oh like let's.
Build up everybody but you on the other.
Hand i was ready to take them yeah.
Because you were a wrestler you actually.
Beat him up or actually we did wrestle.
We did wrestle yeah no i felt um like i.
Said it was it was when i met everybody.
It was more of an honour more than it.
Was kind of weird too because i was like.
Not you guys had already had meetups and.
Stuff like that but i could never go.
Because i was in hawaii and then i moved.
To vegas for college and then i was able.
To go to let youtube live and that's.
When i mean we've already talked i think.
Before then same with like kev and like.
Happyslip all those people back then but.
I never met anyone even david.
That's where i met david - david choi.
Hmm i met youtube live and everybody was.
Just so cool i wasn't expecting that but.
Everybody was cool i will say that kev.
Did say later way later down like five.
Years and then he was like hey man i.
Just wanna let you know back then i'm.
Super competitive with you but i was.
Like oh you know what i kind of felt.
That to turn it before we were friends.
Because it's like another asian dude.
He was like bigger than me too at the.
Time just and he was doing the blog.
Thing he kind of was like watching kinda.
Thick i guess phil was doing that and.
Then what's that other asian dude wine.
Wine cohen who was uh he was doing that.
Too so kevin was like conspired off that.
And then he thought that was the route.
To go we're dropping some names and a.
Lot of new people who yeah tony picture.
Lancome isn't a directory it's one of.
The first i would say one of the first.
Like kind of rent style videos um and.
I've watched him as well the wine conan.
Like i was more into like skits and.
Stuff like that you know smosh was doing.
So uh i went kind of more that path and.
Yeah i guess in kev's head i didn't.
Really see myself as a competitor with.
Him but i i get it because we're kind of.
Like oh people would pair us up in the.
Comments cuz there were two asian dudes.
That's the only reason and younger.
Younger asian if i were a different.
Ethnicity i'm pretty sure it wouldn't.
Have had those similar comments yeah.
There was there was a time when we kind.
Of youtube's seemed to be the sort of.
Kingdom of like asian creators and gay.
Creators yeah and we're like man if you.
Could just get a gaugin creator you.
Would rule youtube yep because yeah.
There was a certain time when and i.
Think it was honestly just because they.
Weren't represented in any other form of.
Media and finally there was a space.
Where you would actually see an asian.
Person on the screen obviously still.
It's not that great but no it's very.
Different but like the crazy rich asians.
Really broke through i know.
Olivia who's in our cast she said like.
She's getting a lot more auditions.
There's a lot more interest in asian.
Actors yeah for sure yeah i mean there.
I'm yeah i mean i did i don't want to.
Get too uh i got a little frustrated.
Sometimes about that whole scene because.
It sounds so bad drop in your podcast i.
Just i feel like people especially in.
The asian community don't aren't.
Acknowledging how much better it is and.
How much better it's getting and they're.
Just like well we're still not like it.
It's it.
It's only a small group of people that.
Don't that still think well it's not.
We're not even close it's just one movie.
But they don't realize like how many.
More how hot of a commodity it is to.
Have asians right now and then i.
Personally think they're gonna milk it.
And then it's gonna be the opposite.
Again for a little bit i think they're.
Gonna milk it right now because it's.
Gonna make money you're gonna see a drop.
In that because people aren't gonna get.
A little over it over stature it's gonna.
Be like a little trend thing and you.
Know but it's all i still think it's.
Better like it's still better i'm i mean.
I think i think china is becoming the.
Largest movie going yeah audience so i.
Mean i doesn't care about.
Asian-americans they care about chinese.
China china chinese but i mean i think.
China's italy into kpop you know i think.
They're i think they're interested in in.
Other and other people as well but.
That's that's gotta be good i feel like.
China like they don't obviously what's.
His crazy rich asians didn't do that.
Well they're obviously didn't do it all.
Because what they want is tom cruise or.
They want like the blockbuster marvel.
And i think what i heard is it put trade.
Chinese chinese yep in like a bad light.
Mmm well from there one of the things i.
Read it yes yeah yeah it makes sense but.
Did it actually play over there it did i.
Think it didn't do well mmm yeah cuz.
It's hard to get i think only a certain.
Number of movies american made movies.
Actually are allowed in and from what.
Maybe i'm maybe this is totally bad.
Information but from what i heard you.
Have to you have to work with certain.
Chinese companies they have to be like.
Involved in the project and you have to.
Also include certain chinese actors in.
Your movie oh wow so that's why like if.
You watch if you saw xxx return of.
Xander cage you know a masterpiece of a.
Movie i think it's i think that's like.
Another h brothers film which is it's a.
Chinese company production company i.
Think and you'll see there's a there's a.
Chinese actor in that and you'll also.
See him in i think he's also in valerian.
Which was funded by some chinese.
Companies.
But it's really funny because because.
There's also other roles where they have.
To portray china in a good light yeah so.
Like with transformers right when they.
Had like the big battle in in china.
There's a scene yeah china comes and.
Saves the day well that's i mean that's.
Smart that's what makes money yeah you.
Make more money later yeah i think in.
Valerian was it blair i think it was.
Valerian like there's like a there's a.
Chinese character that saves the day.
Yeah at the end guys if we see china.
Four more times in the next 13 seconds.
We're on route to beating donald trump.
In his whole presidency well when i say.
We're not saying jane oh that's pretty.
Good dude thank you we're close though.
We're close yeah we're probably on some.
Kind of list we probably won't be.
Allowed in so much tsa is like they're.
On a no-fly list now anyway you so.
Before when i hit you up to do this.
Podcast it was like what three weeks ago.
Yeah i said i'd love to have you.
Obviously and you said that i would love.
To do it but just wait a few weeks and.
You announce something just very.
Recently do you want to talk about that.
Or yeah you yeah i would love to okay.
Can i talk about it i'd love to you tell.
Me i don't know what your contract.
Situations are like yeah so smosh know.
I'm burping now i do my big speech see.
That's what happens.
Nervous it's all coming out it is yeah.
Whenever i had to explain this to my.
Parents and my family friends i i kept.
Doing that was like the whole smosh.
Situation yeah i think it's just like a.
Weird like it's a weird sort of like.
Emotional reaction cuz it's it's been.
Like crazy so okay so backing it up a.
Little bit we sold smosh to a company.
Called alloy digital in like 2011 or so.
Later on that company merged with this.
Company called break and they became.
Defy media which a lot of people know.
About now.
Great reputation sarcasm yeah and in.
October like late october early november.
They very quickly closed down the whole.
Company and laid everyone off with very.
Little warning right and that left smosh.
In a weird place because i don't own it.
It's not like it's not like because they.
Went out of business i get smosh back.
Right.
So essentially fell in the hands of the.
Bank and i then worked with the.
Consultant for like four months to find.
It a new home make sure that it got into.
The right hands and if it didn't go into.
The right hands then i wouldn't be a.
Part of smosh i would leave and probably.
Mostly everyone else would leave and.
Then and then that company would be.
Known for killing smosh right but.
Basically at the final hour when this.
There was a really really bad foreign.
Company that almost got it and i it.
Would have been bad i would have left.
Rhett and link hit us up rhett and link.
The og youtubers are still there in it.
Don't kill in the game.
Some people might know him is good.
Mythical morning they came in and they.
Save the day they bought smosh so so now.
Smosh is a part of their mythical.
Entertainment thing and it's really.
Honestly and i'm not saying this because.
I have to it's the best outcome because.
It they're not owned by anyone like they.
Own rhett and link own mythical entirely.
So they don't have they don't have any.
Like larger company to report to that.
Can shut them down or they don't have.
Any investors that could just pull.
Funding or whatever so now we basically.
Get to really look at everything that is.
Smosh and just kind of you know take.
Apart the machine look at what doesn't.
Work throw that out and put some new.
Pieces and that that we wanted.
You know we think can make the machine.
Work a little better it's it's been a.
Really it's been a tough ass four months.
Every day like we would we would go into.
Meetings with investors or you know.
Other sort of people and you know we'd.
Hear like yes we can we can fund this.
Bah blah blah and then we get a call.
Like the next day and be like oh sorry.
Just not in the time and like oh well.
Now we're screwed.
And like every day it was like it was.
Like you know highs and lows we're gonna.
Make it we're not gonna make it like it.
We're not gonna make it and it was like.
It was draining as hell and i was under.
Nda and all those other stuff so i.
Couldn't tell i couldn't really keep.
Everyone in the smosh family informed as.
To every step that was going on so i.
Just had to be like hey like you know if.
You're able to let's keep getting.
Together and making videos because.
Somebody had defied me access to the.
Channel so i was still uploading right.
But i hadn't been actually managing a.
Channel and so long which is like it.
Sounds so silly from like the outside.
But no i know that's weird.
Yeah we have three channels one before.
If you're counting else smosh but i.
Didn't i didn't run that during the.
Downtime but three channels and i am now.
In charge of uploading and making sure.
Like the video files are correct getting.
All the metadata on there like.
Thumbnails it was a pain in the ass.
Meanwhile trying to also make sure that.
Smosh doesn't go into the hands of right.
Some help    ass company.
Congratulations dude you did it thank.
You.
Oh you're waiting for that i wasn't sure.
When to bring it out that was good so i.
Mean that's i mean that's great.
But what does that mean like coming from.
A viewer perspective was that mean force.
Marcia what is that gonna change like.
Well if i had my biggest issue with defy.
Was just the leadership it was really.
Really bad.
They didn't really put much effort into.
Smosh they just kind of like smosh was.
Successful so they just kind of let it.
Do its own thing and then they i think.
Probably put a lot of money into their.
Things.
That maybe didn't work out which is you.
Know typical company stuff i can't like.
Yeah define did some really bad things i.
Can't say that everything defi did was.
Evil and bad you know they they.
Obviously supported us for many many.
Years and we did gross mosh with them so.
I can't i can't completely dump on them.
But some of the people at the top were.
Bad uh-huh really bad and i'm not a fan.
Of them and i'm glad that were no longer.
Associated with them i now have a.
Leadership position in smosh so i'm able.
To have a say in what happens next.
That's really exciting there's a lot of.
Things that defy didn't do that i felt.
Was a really big oversight about in.
Terms of a content like where they were.
You allowed to just say hey i have this.
Great idea yeah i want to do this on.
This day they were really they were.
Really afraid of of legal things right.
So every single script got passed.
Through a lawyer got it and and they.
They even towards the end got nervous.
About like mentioning brands because.
They're like whoa you know we never know.
You never know if like we're gonna do a.
Brand deal with them or whatever it got.
Really ridiculous and they were also.
Really afraid of some of the new youtube.
Guidelines so they're like okay you can.
Never show a gun you can never show like.
Somebody that like like died in a video.
Even if it's a comical like if somebody.
Gets hit in the head with like a.
Football and they fall on the ground.
They look dead like i can't do that.
That's crazy yeah it was see i i always.
Felt that to be honest i felt like when.
That change happened with you guys and.
I'm officer i didn't say anything you.
Know yeah but i've always wondered i.
Don't know why i'm asking you now i did.
Always wonder like what kind of control.
Did you guys have at that point we had.
We had a considerable amount of creative.
Control.
There was just yes though those things.
Especially towards the end did get more.
Constrained right and like i don't i.
Don't want to promise people like like.
Oh like our videos are gonna be twice as.
Good now because that's.
Not fair like i i think we were already.
Doing a good job with with the youtube.
Content yeah i do think we can do better.
And i think we will yeah.
Now that we have more control and we're.
Gonna we're probably gonna loosen up on.
Some things but i think there's so much.
More out there than just youtube mm-hmm.
I do want to figure out a touring thing.
Because with what we are it's it's so.
Different nowadays from other youtube.
Content like you and me are pretty much.
Like the only people doing sketch comedy.
On youtube now so some are sort of.
Offering with the live show is very.
Different from you know somebody that's.
A vlogger right we have a cast of people.
That can we can create a sort of a live.
Like a variety show almost like a live.
Show and some other stuff i don't want.
Promise anything because this is all.
Very very preliminary and it's all we're.
Gonna leave this and say there's a new.
Live show coming we're taking pounds if.
Sound bites yeah yeah there's a live.
Show variety yeah.
But if you get you saying anthony's.
Coming back as well so well you could.
Just you could just pull out different.
Clips of me saying like anthony and then.
Coming anthony's coming back there.
Well we got it right there so thank you.
Yeah well speaking of anthony yeah just.
Because i mean obviously you guys made.
The video together and it's very cordial.
Is there anything else like i mean how.
Are you guys do you guys still keep in.
Touch at all like um do you i mean i i.
Mean i don't know i have a little bit no.
Idea yeah i mean we keep in touch from.
Time to time.
Obviously he's really busy with his own.
Channel right and and this is something.
We were kind of talking about one i.
Don't know like when is this podcast.
Coming out this is coming out on like.
Next friday's your podcast okay so like.
I think are put i think i'll be talking.
About this in in in our podcast as well.
At the same exact day basically what.
We're saying is like you know all the.
People that are that are pestering us.
And pestering him for him do i come back.
To smosh it's it's really disrespectful.
To both of us mm-hmm like especially to.
Him because like he's doing what he.
Wants to do he didn't want to be doing.
His.
His channel he wouldn't be doing it and.
For people that go on his channel and.
Say come back to smosh like you're only.
Good on smosh like that's super.
Disrespectful yeah so yeah i had to have.
Known that was gonna happen right oh.
100% yeah so i mean cuz a lot of a lot.
Of his beef when he left was was about.
To phi so i see a lot of people think.
Like well now that defines of the.
Picture it's it's gonna like you can.
Come back but it's it's obviously a.
Little bit more than that it's you know.
Obviously we've become creatively kind.
Of two different people so i mean you.
Know yeah with with with a duo or any.
Kind of any kind of partnership.
Creatively it it's hard to sometimes.
Come to an agreement on on content and.
You know the fact the fact that we.
Remained a partnership creatively for so.
Many years is kind of a wonder yeah yeah.
But the door is absolutely open for him.
To come back and be in videos like i.
Would be really excited with the.
Prospect of him be like showing up i.
Think it could be really cool but the.
First video video that he's back there's.
A gun and he gets shot and then dies.
Just so it all comes full circle yeah.
We're gonna we're gonna bruce lee him.
Yeah just because they can now yeah and.
It get it gets to monetizing you can and.
Then you gotta go back to your own ways.
I mean i'm we're the same way even now.
It's like we gotta think about i mean.
We'd get to do a little bit more edgy.
Things but like i've experienced it too.
In terms of just like you mean using.
Like i sometimes would get away with.
Using like two seconds of a song you.
Can't do that anymore.
Yeah even if it's a mention you know we.
Got we got flagged for we got a flag.
From a video from like seven years ago.
Where anthony and i are singing i'll.
Make love to you acapella in bad russian.
Accents that is so that's not even being.
Picked up by youtube that's literally.
Someone look flagging it down it's at.
Like the end card so i don't i don't.
Know how somebody found that because.
Not singing it on key we're singing bad.
Accents that's how good you were and.
There's no music playing behind it.
Uh-huh and somehow some someone.
Physically you had to watch it and be.
Like that is i know who owns the rights.
To this and they go i don't know i don't.
Know it's like covers supposed to be.
Okay.
No you'd have to get some kind of.
Resolution of some sort or be with like.
A mcn yeah covers aren't aren't you.
Can't do covers covers aren't covered.
Covers on cobra broke the claiming.
Business is actually really a really big.
Business yeah there's a lot of money in.
Claiming so a lot of large companies.
Will hire businesses to just scour.
Youtube and claim videos well now it's.
It's automatic like a lot of it's.
Automatic a lot of it is but there's.
Still a lot of manual no there are i.
Mean i-i've in this past year i mention.
It to another video i think i've gotten.
Like literally probably ten times more.
And probably like half my videos got.
Claimed and it's still happening every.
Like couple every week some of them.
Justified some you can do i could.
Dispute but like it's such a long.
Process it's like almost not worth the.
Energy it's like okay fine okay.
This video still gets views over time.
And i get over time you're gonna get a.
Lot more but like i just don't have the.
Energy to like dispute every single.
Thing yeah and some are some are.
Justified i get it it's just like kind.
Of ridiculous yeah we had we had one.
That was really annoying we have this.
Really this really fun series on our.
Second channel called try not to laugh.
Where somebody sits on a stool and then.
People dress up in props and stuff in.
The background then they come out and.
They get thirty seconds to try to make.
That person laugh right and we had this.
Guy his name on like instagrams juji mu.
Foo he's like this big buff guy and he.
Does like backflips and all these like.
Crazy acrobatics i had him on the show.
And we use like two like short clips of.
Him to like show what he does and juke.
And media claim that really whole damn.
Video and it's like because.
We had him on the video like he would be.
Cool with us using these clips but.
Jookin we can't curse on this i.
Don't know we never said our first.
Really sponsor on this one so there.
Isn't so yeah i don't think sponsors.
Really care with pod casts i don't think.
They do either i just never done it yeah.
But you could be the one okay i was like.
So i was occasionally i cannot talk.
Occasionally i was self censoring myself.
Because i wasn't sure cuz most podcasts.
Are like who cares i mean just all say.
It once together i mean if it comes out.
Naturally then it will you know oh this.
I just i get really upset i just have a.
Lot of hatred for jookin oh just like i.
Just hate that whole business model they.
Literally just they just buy clips and.
Then license them and whenever somebody.
Uses their clip then they just claim it.
And take the money it's it's a it's a.
Shitty business oh i don't know i just.
Curse together great i just really don't.
Like chicken.
You really don't really coming out like.
You can see all the dirt is coming to.
Help man we're about to set up a fight.
With setting up a boxing plate yeah just.
Get into that about would you ever do.
That hell no i've never been punched in.
The face before would you like our.
Wrestling our wrestling match was.
Probably the most confrontational i've.
Ever been with anybody really yeah that.
Was a visit me.
Filmed agents of secret stuff by the way.
Yeah for ian his board yeah and we.
Wrestled and he was in his suit and it.
Was a little revealing.
I was gonna say you can kind of see my.
Dog through it yeah interested yeah i.
Was wearing a blue suit and i tried to.
Last in the ring what 30 seconds so i.
Just ran around the ring and tried to.
Avoid you actually think i saw that one.
Yeah yeah it was funny it was fun one.
More time.
I was just wondering yes i mean you know.
Everybody's that whole scene is blowing.
Up it helps everybody that does it yeah.
I'm sure it does but then after the.
Match.
Nobody cares true it's you know what i.
Did now it's gone i'd be afraid of if i.
Got into a boxing match and they knocked.
Me out so hard i peed myself.
I think people would understand that.
Yeah but that was a terrible sex way.
Into our oh yeah we do have to do a she.
She break okay that means - it's a pee.
Break but we just call she she anyway um.
Quick she she break yeah we've been.
Going for a bit anyway yeah we'll be.
Right back.
She she break she she get road to help.
You up that's the most controversial or.
Confrontational he's ever been dude he.
Just hit them on yeah anyway and we're.
Back.
Yo that's how we get back into it anyway.
Um what are we saying.
I don't know talking about obama boxing.
And by yeah i will say that i i did.
Remember that one part from the boxing.
Match oh it's really funny because like.
You know i didn't really want to support.
That that match so uh there was a group.
Of there's a group of maybe maybe like.
Twenty of us that all went over to one.
Person's house so we only had to pay for.
One but i do have i do have some respect.
For god i forget his name he went it he.
Went up against the rock iraq one of the.
Rack iraq is it one of the drama guys.
Yeah yeah he's one of the drama guys the.
Guy that comes out from behind the tree.
That's not his whole mean what is it now.
We're she's gonna be upset.
Yeah anyway just look on your phone i.
Mean that was that was he was clearly.
Gonna lose yeah cuz both the wrecker.
Racket goes like have you ever watched.
Our videos yeah they're awesome but.
They're insane yeah those guys are.
Insane and if you've like seen any that.
They're hilarious they're they're like.
Amateur wrestlers too so they're just.
Extremely physically capable guys and.
They went up against him and it's like.
Ah man like yeah so i got to give props.
To that guy that went up against the.
Rack ragged dude cuz uh-huh yeah man had.
Heart yeah yeah.
I'm just the most important thing but i.
Help you win but yeah i respect no i.
Don't help you in i believe in heart you.
Know it's a big part of it oh for sure.
Um i'll hit you up to uh or who if you.
Had to who would i box yep.
If i had to everyone's like oh there's.
No way we could hit each other we're so.
Passive-aggressive against each other.
But if you had to though i don't think.
Of them standing any worse quite.
Everywhere just like talking about each.
Other yeah i don't think we ever even.
Like raised our voices at each other.
Yeah like yeah i was gonna say like one.
Of it one of the people that was running.
To phi or junkin junket yeah yeah i'll.
Box juke and media yeah okay i shouldn't.
Say that because maybe there's some like.
Mma bro that runs that yeah website i.
Don't know i don't know if i ever said.
This publicly and i don't think he would.
Mind but when that all was happening as.
It was getting planned out the second.
The second i think no the first fight.
Actually rice come hit me up and he.
Wanted to box me i think you did mention.
This i might have mentioned it i don't.
Know where though where would i have.
Mentioned it when i think oh maybe it.
Was one i don't think i at least yeah i.
Was like one of those like really our.
Test versions okay.
I don't think like boxing or i mean you.
Would still annihilate him but he might.
Be a great boxer for his good reach he's.
Got he's wrong and i don't know how to.
You right it was an mma fight i think.
I'd be pretty confident but not in.
Boxing i'm a browser.
Oh you're what i mean it's the same it's.
The same advantage that logan had you're.
A natural-born athlete well no i.
Wouldn't say not i wouldn't say natural.
Okay but i mean you're and i'm very much.
Out of shape compared to like when i.
Used to do a lot of sports he says that.
And he's like as you said he is flexing.
A little bit but i mean like obviously.
You're you're a highly.
Pettit of person you were where you.
Liked state-ranked or something with.
With wrestling or wrestling yeah he won.
First place in states come on man it's a.
Small states hawaii yeah it's not like.
It was uh all right how strong was he.
When he beat you up though and he was.
Smiling the whole time right yeah he.
Wasn't really trying that's the thing.
It's necessary think cuz running around.
In a slipper i was suit i was fighting.
For my life well that would be an.
Interesting that would be an interesting.
Fight i don't say it i wouldn't say you.
Should do it though no i mean the thing.
Is i the only reason i would do it if it.
Were mma because i'm a fan of the sport.
Yeah and i already have some experience.
In it so i wouldn't have to put in like.
You know granted his experience you know.
That's not fair if he has none but if he.
Does have some experience in boxing yeah.
And i've experienced in wrestling and.
Judo then it kind of balances a little.
Bit more you know yeah i mean it just.
Wouldn't be fair no it would.
It wouldn't be fun to watch if it was.
Mma because you would just take him down.
And put him in some kind of hold unless.
You're really good and nobody knew he's.
Better he's really good at like.
Surprisingly athletic at basketball we.
Played with him oh really he's good he's.
Actually really good at basketball and.
Honestly when i first looked at him i.
Didn't think he was gonna be athletic.
He's pretty good okay well maybe i take.
Everything i said maybe he was like he's.
A sleeper he's one of those people.
Who've been training and he thinks like.
I think he doesn't know how to fight but.
He can fight he's waiting that's what i.
Said i didn't fall for the trap rice.
Let's try brian yeah nice try don't and.
While you by your screen name yeah why.
Were you buying.
Why were you balling with rice gum.
What's that all about he uh so he lived.
Out here so this is like right when he.
Was kind of getting big we uh he kind of.
Reached out and it was uh i would say i.
Even mentioned it in that song exposed.
Song that he when i went out we hung out.
With him he was like you know i know he.
Has a bad rap and stuff like that and he.
Does the whole like forcing kids but.
When i know he's like a very nice shy.
Kind of i guess a kid at the time he's.
Um he's probably always been a nice.
Person it's just i just have a persona.
Exactly yeah but you know we we filmed.
With him and i dare you a long time ago.
He was story.
To get big and i kind of see like you.
Know okay he's kind of he's feeling it.
You know i mean everybody goes through.
It a little bit right when you start.
Getting that fame you kind of feel like.
Oh i'm getting more money than i ever.
Thought i would i'm getting more girls.
Or you know whatever it is and at the.
Same time he was like you know we had.
This really deep talk after we played.
Basketball together i was driving him.
Home and he was just like stressing like.
I don't know like maybe i should move to.
La or what do you think i should do like.
He's very like he was very kind of um.
I'm sure he doesn't actually i don't.
Know if he'll mind if i'm talking about.
It but it was just very normal he's a.
Normal guy going through like a lot of.
Stress yeah and i think part of that you.
Know whether it's a persona or whether.
It's him he it's kind of like a defense.
Mechanism i think i think it's because.
He feels that's where he feels.
Comfortable that's what got him made and.
He kind of just ran with it and you know.
Just liked it like a prank channel or.
Anything you have to top yourself you.
Have to go above and beyond consistently.
Or else people lose interest yep so yeah.
I think happened i mean when you when.
You build your whole when you build your.
Whole persona around always raising the.
Bar and pushing the envelope then you.
Like you said you have to keep pushing.
The envelope yeah if that's what your.
Game is eventually you're you're going.
To reach a breaking point yeah whether.
It's your content or your mental.
Well-being.
Exactly see but that's why i think like.
Um like i get why he gets the hate he.
Gets it's the content that he puts out.
Right so but i don't think a lot of.
People know who he really is.
And that i think it's also just i mean.
It's not their fault for not knowing.
That but i think a lot of youtubers are.
Like that actually they know that it.
Works i'm sure there's some that are.
Very genuine that are very not saying.
That he's not but i'm sure there there's.
Some that are very much just douchebag.
But and they put on like a.
Family-friendly front yeah there's that.
To it there's that you know that is like.
Strangely a thing yeah where if they're.
Putting on like a nice sort of thing.
Online then yeah i don't know no it's.
True yeah i mean i.
I we're not gonna say names but i'm sure.
We you know people over the years and.
Stuff like that i mean most of the.
People i've met have all been wonderful.
Yeah me too even if i even have never.
Met i don't think i've ever met.
Rice gum even if i met him in real life.
I don't think we had have a bad.
Experience.
No get along just fine probably super.
Pullet even when i met um logan paul for.
The first time i wasn't and he wasn't.
This is before like all the you know.
Controversy and stuff like that just one.
Of the nicest people and i only met him.
Once but i you know he can't get much.
From one meeting but he just came up to.
Me at a party he said oh i was i'm such.
A big fan of your your videos from back.
In the day i was like oh i like your.
Vines i didn't know he was on youtube at.
The time but yeah it was like around.
That era and it was just like a normal.
Conversation and then when all this.
Stuff started happening i was like oh he.
Messed up well he's gonna get some pr.
For that made him bigger yeah and then.
Just the thing is it just made him.
Bigger and bigger so how can you really.
It's positive reinforcement yeah you.
Know like in his head obviously it's.
Like well yes all this drama things.
Making people say some bad things about.
Me but i'm also blowing up so like how.
Can he yeah i mean it's all speculation.
But i think you know when you're.
Creating content like that without any.
Sort of without any kind of purpose yeah.
When you're just doing it because you.
Need to push the envelope yeah you'll.
Get a lot of views but you're not you're.
Not i don't think you're really building.
A core sort of audience and that's.
Something that i feel like you know you.
Guys have done i feel like that's.
Something that smosh is done like our.
Audience has always been like not very.
Engaged but i feel like you know we've.
We've always had a sort of core and and.
You see those sort of channels that that.
Have just followed a certain trend or.
They get locked into one sort of like.
Format and they just ride that thing all.
The way up and then once the algorithm.
Shifts you know and that trend is no.
Longer good for the algorithm the bottom.
Falls out from under those people.
Except that the algorithm hasn't changed.
In a very long time it has there there.
Are things in the algorithm that a.
Change well i mean they're still doing.
Well oh yeah that's true.
Actually they're not what it was even.
Last year but they're still huge yeah i.
Mean there was there was like recent.
There was recent stuff that that picked.
Him up a little bit again but you know.
That they kind of because they don't.
Really stand for anything you know if i.
Have to they have to keep pushing the.
Envelope and i mean i'll still say it.
Like logan paul is extremely talented.
Yeah i do think he's really a really.
Talented guy so i just i'm just really.
Disappointed because the after the.
Forest then i was like i was like this.
Is his chance to completely reinvent.
Himself yeah and go down a new path and.
It'll be really good and he didn't do it.
And i mean he still obviously succeeded.
Yeah very well i know what you mean it.
Could have took that other turn and kind.
Of like reinvented himself yeah like cuz.
It was such a big event that's like your.
Perfect opportunity to i mean look at.
Any celebrity goes through that stuff.
You know there people want that change.
And then you can always change it up.
Again later but like the whole like it's.
Very similar to that like at least how i.
See it is like the whole miley cyrus.
Situation is like she was this very.
Clean whatever girl and then people are.
Like what the hell she turned into this.
Miley drug miley twerking miley and.
She's so out of character people were.
Just like super interested but at the.
Same time like hating on her like this.
Is not how i should be she want a new.
Audience there but now that she's kind.
Of reverted back to old miley it's like.
Oh now i want to root for this girl cuz.
She's like you know she's seeing her.
Wrongs and like she's trying to be a.
Better person and she's dating that.
Famous dude hemsworth again you know so.
It's like it's like a very i don't know.
I think it strategic yeah it's a really.
Good really good career move i mean i.
Guess before her christina aguilera did.
It.
I mean we all remember the dirty area.
Era of christina aguilera come on you.
Guys remember it.
I mean i'm trying to think of the people.
Watching remember probably not.
Oh god world no yeah but that was the.
Thing like christina aguilera started.
Out with like genie genie in a bottle.
Like she was like this kind of like a.
Little bit risque but like still sort of.
Wholesome i think i don't know i wasn't.
Like a big fan but then she came out.
With dirty and she went like full-blown.
Like like i'm like this sexy and like.
You know as a freshman in high school.
And that came out that was very stoked i.
Mean it just britney spears same thing.
Right yeah yeah and then and then they.
Had kind of had that sort of with.
Christina i feel had that sort of like.
Mit like she matured and then she was.
Like acted because she's an amazing.
Singer so she was able just kind of like.
Mature into this sort of like i am now.
Like i am now a woman i'm mature woman.
And people loved it but it's the same.
Trend everything look at justin bieber.
Same thing this innocent little kid.
Right plays like you look cute kid.
That's like you want to support him all.
The little girls love him closer like.
This this man face like i'm i'm the man.
I'm gonna take off my shirt and then.
Start you know get tattoos and stuff.
Like that and look buff look but he is.
You got buffer yeah um and then now he's.
Back into like well i'm going back to.
Church and well not that he didn't go to.
Church but you know he's putting on that.
Uh but i don't know i think it's the.
Same trend i've seen with celebrities at.
Least oh it happens all the time and.
That was logan's chance to go through.
That phase i think and then he could.
Always come back which i think would.
Happen but yeah and i think he's just.
Like uh it's an it's because people see.
That as being human that it's relatable.
Like if someone is perfect and always.
Perfect it's like wow i love this person.
But i can't relate to them i would like.
To be this person but when you see.
Someone fail and then and then they.
Succeed that's a story that you can.
Align yourself with and be like if they.
Can do it if they can go through.
Something way tougher than i went.
Through then then that gives me hope.
Yeah yeah i honestly i.
I thought logan was gonna was gonna sort.
Of like go down the the route of like.
Raising awareness for suicide like a.
Little bit later a little bit he did one.
One video yeah one and then it was and.
Then it was back to as far as i remember.
Got back to the haze though a dead rat.
Or something like i was like i really.
Like this soon man maybe could also be.
The people that he's around to knows i.
Mean like i mean yeah you gotta find you.
Gotta find good people to surround.
Yourself with if you surround yourself.
With with yes-men people that'll just.
Tell you they could also convince.
Convince you that it's oh yeah that's.
Not that bad ya know yeah yeah i mean.
Who i mean we're gonna be called.
Apologist now logan paul apologist logan.
Apologists you guys having podcast as.
Well yeah i'm impulsive also yeah yeah.
Now is that something that either of you.
Would ever consider going on go on logan.
Paul's podcast yeah um i mean i don't.
Know it well enough but i saw clips on.
His instagram of like doing some kind of.
Crazy stuff here like some guy gets.
Kicked in the balls or did he do some.
Crazy stuff is it gonna i don't know if.
I would want to do that but if it were.
Just to talk to him i'd have no issues.
Talking to anyone to me at least i don't.
Know about you i know people might.
Associate your brand so it's like a.
Little you know but to me i'm okay with.
Talking to anyone.
Yeah it seems like he's i don't know.
I've only seen clips again yeah it seems.
Like he's kind of trying to do like a.
Howard stern thing mm-hmm like it's not.
Like i thought again he i thought with.
The podcast he was gonna reinvent.
Himself and go like a little bit more.
Mature yeah and then it was like the.
Third guest on was a porn star i'm like.
All right dude.
But i reading the comments and stuff it.
Seems like people are really really.
Liking it like apparently it's good.
I mean it's entertainment yeah yeah you.
Know this i mean like this is just us.
Hanging out and talking we're not.
Kicking people in the balls we don't got.
Like random strippers or whatever yeah.
But i'm not opposed to having a stripper.
To talk to or a pornstar sorry i would.
Talk to a porn star.
I wouldn't make her do anything crazy.
Also a kara is actually so funny the way.
Ausa kira who was a porn star.
Did she also do like go ahead deeply a.
Passive yeah i think i just want to be.
Clear i'm never i've never heard that.
Name i don't have any idea who you're.
Talking about up christina aguilera i.
Was stoked she went on.
Qasim's okay that's going deep yeah i.
Know you can't do something like that on.
Youtube no qasim is so he's so good that.
Was so funny.
Yeah and as a last question as the.
Grandfather's kind of of youtube in a.
Way you guys have been here for so long.
We're dying you dying literally a dying.
Breed though sketch comedy how um what.
Is some of the strangest fan.
Interactions that you've had what does.
This one always come up with every.
Person well it's because i'm asking that.
What oh yeah i'll let ian go because.
Wherever we already answered this yeah i.
Mean the weird one that we always say it.
Was a time when back when anthony and i.
Lived at the same house the address got.
Leaked and people started showing up at.
Our house like on a almost daily basis.
And somebody somebody decided like in.
The middle of the night that they were.
Gonna go into the side of the house like.
Through a fence uh-huh and they took a.
Picture of anthony through the window.
That is so weird.
Yeah that's cool i actually have a.
Similar one to that i didn't tell it i.
Don't know i didn't tell this story but.
Similar same thing somebody i mean.
People found out where i lived my other.
Place and i had cameras though and i.
Just so happened to have my tv on that.
Has a different cameras and i just see.
These kids like just i might you know.
Not not doing any of my front like kind.
Of garage area my on my driveway so.
You're not really like trespassing but.
Then i just keep watching them and then.
You just see them talking and you see.
This one kid go over and he runs up the.
Stairs looked in the window and he.
Starts filming inside.
Yeah and then basically it's just like.
That's one of the main reasons why i.
Moved here because i was just like that.
Was happening a lot at the other house.
Once they find out where you live it's.
Um it's very uncomfortable i always kept.
My windows closed and you know it makes.
You feel weird man yeah i mean i.
Wouldn't suggest everybody goes and go.
And do this but i mean i bought a gun.
Yeah like oh you're gonna get so much.
Hate yeah i know.
Well it's look i i definitely don't.
Recommend everybody go out in california.
Yeah.
You can that oh i guess you have to just.
Get a which one call right like you need.
Some kind of license or something in.
California with a shotgun no oh really.
Always literally i paid 300 bucks and i.
Had it in like two weeks or something.
Like that you do like a background check.
Or something but they do you don't need.
A permit for a shotgun or a handgun you.
Have to take like a written test a.
Concealed weapon yeah and then no not a.
Not a concealed for a handgun yeah just.
For at least back when i was thinking.
About it oh you had to take a test like.
A written test and then you had a permit.
That expired like a couple years later.
Right welcome to gun talk yeah and it's.
Obviously i didn't i didn't have the.
Intention of going out there and.
Shooting fans but yeah well i mean it's.
Its intended purpose if someone comes.
And breaks into your house like you have.
Some way to protect yourself if they.
Have a gun too you know yeah and like.
And that was my reason for the shotgun.
Over something like a handgun was the.
Sound alone should be enough to scare.
Most people away unless you're like a.
Quasi murderer which is very rare you.
Know if you're just somebody looking to.
Break in and steal some equipment like.
You're not gonna take that risk so if.
You just hear that then you're you're.
Not gonna stick around yeah i don't plan.
On shooting anybody.
I certainly don't want to shoot anybody.
I don't fantasize about shooting anybody.
I think you know gun violence is.
Obviously a huge problem but yours i.
Mean you have a you're a special kate i.
Mean like not to make you feel like you.
Know but i mean it's true like you.
There's a very legitimate reason as.
Why you have that gun yeah and it's.
Not for fans that are that are trying to.
Take pictures through my window it's.
It's it's the fact that you know our.
Address is out there it only takes one.
Person to say well they're youtubers i.
Bet they have some pretty expensive.
Video and audio equipment or one crazy.
Person that's all it takes.
Yeah i mean i've never banked on the.
Crazy person aspect of it but it did.
Happen it did happen to gavin and make.
Turn i know yeah and that that was scary.
As hell cuz that's that's sort of the.
Thing that every sort of youtuber feared.
And and you know thank god they're okay.
You know like that one crazy that's what.
I mean though there's so many people in.
The world and because people know you.
There's a higher probability of someone.
Crazy coming and doing something that.
Yet and i mean obviously the the girls.
Online have to worry about that a little.
Bit more yeah sure oh yeah there was.
There's some there's some youtuber that.
Was telling a person so this is gonna be.
A third person story but they said that.
They had a there this guy reached out.
Out to out to her it was a fan and he's.
Like hey um i'm just making sure you.
Haven't been talking directly to me have.
You and she she was like no and he's.
Like okay thank you because i have this.
Mental condition where i watch when i'm.
Watching something i think they're.
Talking directly to me what yeah so so.
He had the wherewithal to realize that.
Because of this you know mental illness.
That he could not be possibly thinking.
Straight yeah but it's those it's that.
Possible that's a fortunate scenario.
That is very easily with a very people.
Who are self aware of that yeah you know.
Yeah and then and then it's those kinds.
Of people not that i'm trying to like.
Say a certain type of like mental.
Illness is responsible right this is.
Anything but the people that aren't.
Right in the head that you know the guy.
That broke in there was obsessed with.
Meg right like had thousands of notes on.
His phone about like his love for her.
And like how he was gonna kill gavin or.
Whatever it was nuts yeah and you know.
Obviously it's not like something that.
Youtubers should be worried about every.
Moment of the day but yeah but just you.
Know being aware of something like that.
Yeah see the thing is the way that i.
Justify that that you know i know that.
Already people are gonna be like oh i.
Can't believe ian has a go what and.
There's gonna be people regardless.
Because we shot a video where we.
Literally just went to the desert and.
Shotguns yeah that's i think you do out.
Here i didn't think much of it and we.
Got so much ridiculous hate for that i'm.
Sure but the thing is about the whole.
Situation and your situation and why i.
Think it's fine is because if everybody.
Didn't have guns that there was no guns.
Yeah of course well you don't need a gun.
Even though it's alright.
You know if but the fact that you don't.
That's not put into place you know like.
That's you need i mean i understand your.
Concern for that yeah i mean i my i have.
No black or white thoughts i think.
That's that's the issue with with you.
Know any sort of gun control debate is.
It so black and white of like you're.
Either for guns or against guns and i'm.
Like i mean there's certain cases where.
Like maybe it's it's alright but like.
There's also a lot of people that.
Definitely should not have guns and.
Maybe there are just too many guns.
Yeah well the original reason was for.
Tourney right like that's the reason why.
That a second amendment.
Sure yeah but we all had single fire.
Muskets like two minutes not that we.
Need to not that we need to get into any.
Gun control talk because that's really.
Not an interest among the concert people.
Like yeah i know but um yeah that's.
That's that's cool of you to admit it's.
In that same and that's also kind of the.
Funny i always think about this with.
Like there is like a lot of people hood.
You know from an outsider perspective.
Like everyone thinks california is like.
This you know super liberal democrat gun.
Control hellhole it's like well i know a.
Lot of people you could basically.
Classify as rednecks like uh-huh like.
California is a very diverse sort of.
State and i mean we're you know a lot of.
Us are descendants of pioneers people.
That traveled across the frickin country.
In a wagon and wrist you know life and.
To come out here and you know there's.
Still a lot of that sort of like you.
Know rugged sort of lifestyle that that.
Exists i mean there's there's like like.
A more like way northern california they.
Tried to secede ya know they try to form.
Their own state north california.
It's called know there were sorry there.
Was gonna be three right well no this is.
Early as it was called the state of.
Jefferson oh i didn't know that yeah and.
It's like a little bit of oregon and.
Then and then like like northern.
Northern california huh and yeah they.
Just they didn't like how things were.
And they wanted their own state whatever.
Happened to the separating california to.
Three parts that i think the courts the.
Courts knocked it down.
No so it showed up in our it showed up.
In our voting yeah but it said like the.
Supreme court of california or something.
Has like voted out yeah so it wasn't on.
The ballot it was such a stupid idea.
Anyway like i mean i didn't know enough.
About it to comment but i just remember.
I was like oh more states to remember.
Yeah you know sucks for kids yeah.
Anything like 52 states you have to.
Learn about now and guam and all this.
Stuff i mean as maniacs would have to.
Change their song yeah it is kind of.
Weird though that california is one.
State but there's what 40 million people.
That live in one state such a big sock.
It's like two-thirds of the east coast.
Or something like the size of it west.
Coast.
No it's the same oh yeah two-thirds of.
Like i don't know it's huge yeah yeah i.
Don't know alaska's 3 times the size of.
Texas i do know that yeah paco's coming.
With those africa's tax something times.
The size of i don't know i'm just.
Looking at me and we're doesn't even.
Memes boy i just love whatever there's.
Like an asteroid they're always like.
It's twice the size of texas or like.
Three times the size of great britain.
I mean it's a unit of measurement for us.
You know i guess so we wouldn't.
Understand in cubic meters or somebody.
With no i mean yeah if someone is like.
It's 5,000 inches how does it and then.
You convert it to feet it's not as.
Impressed let that be easier for us and.
Like meters because we're not on the.
Metric system that don't you haha wait.
This topic got like very serious and.
Dark towards the n huh yeah that's how i.
Like to take things now that's good rope.
You in with the light fluffy things and.
Then i'll just tear your heart out and.
Then we talk about gun control and now.
That's every what everyone's gonna be.
Talking about unless we talk unless we.
Bring up something i don't know but i.
Think it's we don't really we always end.
Up bringing some political thing in here.
But what my original intention is to.
Talk about things i'm interested in.
Obviously what the guest if there's a.
Guest what they're interested in - and i.
Guess i am interested in politics kid.
Always comes up at least once a podcast.
Yeah.
But um you're talking about life and.
Life is politics.
And i but the thing is i'm not the most.
Educated person on this stuff but i have.
My own opinions what politics you off oh.
