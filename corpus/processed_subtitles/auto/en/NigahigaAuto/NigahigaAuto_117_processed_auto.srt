You.
Hey guys so as many of you guys have.
Probably already heard youtube has.
Recently been sending out these diamond.
Play buttons for youtubers that have.
Over 10 million subscriber you know it's.
Like when they sent out those gold play.
Buttons for youtubers over a million.
Subscribers or like the silver ones for.
Youtubers over 100,000 which by the way.
I have not gotten yet for either of my.
Channels this one or higatv you know.
What it's fine i don't it's not like i.
Care you want to know why i don't care.
I'll tell you why this one has two.
Thumbs in the 10 million subscriber.
Diamond play button ha ha ha that's.
Right this guy oh yeah and also i have.
One too woo.
Sehun is the hundred thousand silver.
Button when you got the gold and the.
Time i don't care at all most of the.
Time i mean i do care a little bit but.
It's not like it's on my mind all the.
Time it's a little weird you know don't.
You think it's freaking weird it's like.
If you have a wartortle and a blastoise.
But no spoon squared glad we're not but.
Anyway i'm getting totally off topic.
Video was not meant to be about what we.
Don't have but what we do have it for me.
What i do have is a 10 million.
Subscriber diamond play button i can.
Honestly say to that change my life.
Oh my oh my god it's so bright.
Everything changed the day i got my.
Diamond play button i just got this.
Sense of empowerment knowledge i could.
See the world for what it really was.
Water felt wetter i could suddenly see.
The air move i couldn't smell music but.
With this neat gift the vision i could.
Now see what this award really meant to.
Me wasn't about the fame that came with.
It it wasn't even about the fortune it.
Was about making my dad proud my dad.
Want you to have this what is the sun.
The-- 10 million subscriber diamond.
Play button there's only a few people in.
The world that happened and i want you.
To have it so that you'll finally be.
Proud of me oh son you don't have to.
Give me anything that might not say it a.
Lot but i've always been proud of you i.
Love you son.
You too dad okay yeah obviously i.
Exaggerated a lot receiving the diamond.
Play button didn't actually change that.
Much at least in terms of fame and.
Fortune like i said those things.
Fame fortune they never mattered to me.
They never did it was and always has.
Been.
About making my dad proud and that is.
What the diamond play button really.
Meant to me dad want you to have this.
What is this son to dia ten million.
Subscriber diamond play button there's.
Only a few people in the world that have.
It and i want you to have it so you'll.
Finally be proud of what this    oh.
Okay yeah maybe this award isn't.
Something that everybody understands and.
Appreciates it's a big deal i'm sure.
Maybe the award is a few years late cuz.
Most of us you know that celebrated 10.
Million subscribers did so about a few.
Years ago yeah it's not an oscar an emmy.
So by having it you don't get more.
Famous or more wealthy in fact it's not.
Even made out of diamonds so it doesn't.
Add really any monetary value at all.
What you don't want bro you naysayers.
And doubters this this award is still.
Awesome oh yeah there's a lot that this.
Award can still do okay first of all it.
Still makes a great house decoration i.
Mean for you have to probably put on the.
Ground or like on a table or something.
Because it's too heavy to hang on the.
Wall but it's still nice to look at or.
You could just carry it around with you.
At all times because it makes a great.
Conversation starter.
Whose heavy season here has i got so.
There's shine what is this oh yeah oh.
Wow a trophy or ten million subscribers.
That's a lot of subscribers and if you.
Ask me you know like you say something.
What what huh did you say something no i.
Don't think so.
I didn't say okay cool cool look at this.
No see and that's just a little taste of.
How valuable and useful the diamond play.
Button really is i didn't even start.
Talking about how great of a paperweight.
It is or a door stopper booster seat for.
The short tin cans were like thin can.
Leave it out in the sun it's a frying.
Pan in the freezer and you guys don't.
Want to talk right i'm sorry i actually.
Started this video as a thank-you video.
To you guys clearly that didn't happen.
Obviously i was just joking earlier well.
I mean kinda you really can't use those.
Words for all those things i mean.
Literally when i first opened it and.
Looked at the awards straight on i first.
Thought that actually came to mind what.
I finally know what i would look like.
From the point of view of spiders ken.
Went off track again in all seriousness.
Despite all the jokes i just want to.
Thank all of you guys and of course.
Youtube as well many of you guys already.
Know this but i'm actually not that big.
On award i don't normally watch any.
Award shows like most people do like the.
Oscars grammys emmys teen choice vmas.
Whatever nothing against them i just.
Don't find it interesting just my.
Opinion i mean it's human nature it's.
All it always feels nice to get.
Recognized for something but my thought.
Process is and has always been that we.
Put a little too much value into these.
Awards and that's a whole nother topic.
And don't get me wrong i am so.
Appreciative of this award like youtube.
Didn't have to send us anything for 10.
Million subscribers but they still did.
But what i'm even more appreciative of.
Is the fact that all of you are still.
Watching and supporting and i'm super.
Thankful to youtube not just for the.
Award itself but this award gave me an.
Excuse to make this video and thank all.
The people that got me this or in the.
First place all of you that subscribe.
Seriously thank you guys so much you.
Guys hear that all the time but it.
Hasn't changed you guys know that.
Literally 90% of my time sleeping is.
Like 50 40 percent 30 percent eating is.
Another 20 percent it's 5050 percent.
All my time goes into making these.
Videos i literally work on something.
Every single day and i hope you guys.
Know that it's because i i want to.
Create good content calm this video.
Still haven't gotten that hundred.
Thousand silver button but you know i.
Like i said i don't care it's not like.
I'm waiting for it i don't lose sleep.
Over it at night it's not like i.
Carefully listen all day long for the.
Doorbell to ring you know hoping that.
It's the mailman bringing my no yeah see.
I don't it doesn't matter and that's the.
Lesson of this video okay i don't need.
An award to validate my existence and.
You guys don't need an award to validate.
You're much too confident and my.
Self-esteem is so high plus like i said.
I already cut the diamond play button.
Okay so why would i even want a little.
Silver.
Sorry it took so long without further.
Ado this is for our favorite asian on.
Youtube congratulations for surpassing.
100,000 subscribers rice gum oh there it.
