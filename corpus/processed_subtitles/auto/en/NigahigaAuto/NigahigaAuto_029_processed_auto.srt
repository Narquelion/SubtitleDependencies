Do you write can you make a boy bad.
Music video about games we got asked to.
Do something very similar before but i.
Think it was about um posted sandwiches.
Music.
Yep that's what it was there's a small.
Part of a bigger deer ryan i remember.
Because so many of you were commenting.
About how you wanted the full version of.
This song you guys are commenting more.
About that small part that dear ryan.
Than you were about the rest of the.
Videos so that was shocking guys i.
Recorded the entire song in my closet.
Using a very cheap microphone and using.
Stock garageband that it comes with.
Every single mac and it sounded awesome.
So yeah i just try probably sort of put.
It on i it was just kidding in the so.
Bad we were trying to parody basically.
90's boy band it's back in the 90s way.
If you are alive then didn't seem cringy.
Then but you go and watch them now it's.
A straight-up big old-fashioned.
Cringefest why do that you'd have to say.
It like that.
I am so off topic back to the video hey.
Guys i probably should have comment on.
This first but as you can see the vlog.
Room has finally completed crazy of.
Shawn and dana.
They actually surprised me and created.
This whole thing without me knowing what.
It was gonna be and i love it they have.
A second channel video coming soon.
Showing the whole thing anyway so now.
That everything is set and i'm all moved.
In we can finally get back into the.
Swing of things i know i know we've been.
A little slow on posting videos lately.
That's you know carrying over from last.
Year as well it's completely my fault.
Not only because of the whole moving.
Situation getting messed up but also.
Because well i i don't know how else to.
Say this but i i relapsed again um it's.
Hard for me to talk about as some of you.
Guys already know i have had a very.
Dangerous addiction to well.
Music.
I've had a dangerous addiction to it.
Music.
When i get stressed out i okay find this.
Bit is not funny addiction is a real.
Thing i know see this is just paper i.
Don't actually smoke this was root beer.
And well this one's real as you guys.
Know i kind of do have an addiction to.
Energy drinks but you know what's the.
Big deal nobody ever gets hurt from.
Energy my chest.
The real dangerous addiction i relapse.
Into was well gaming too much energy.
Drinks and i know i know a lot of you.
Think that this is some kind of joke.
It's not when i get really into games it.
Harms every aspect of my life because.
I'm one of those people that you know.
When i get into a game i get really into.
It you know because it's fun my eating.
Patterns changed because i forget to eat.
A lot of times i skip meals when i'm.
Playing games free time that i would.
Normally use to work out or go hang out.
With people in real life go straight to.
Gaming i'm constantly sleep-deprived.
Because i keep pushing myself making.
Four hours is enough sleep three hours.
So you still feel okay - it's not that.
Bad well the sun's already up so i might.
As well stay up i mean i got these i.
Don't really need it i'm sure a lot of.
You gamers have very similar experiences.
Maybe not all of you but one of the.
Biggest things that gaming can take a.
Toll on relationships because more than.
Anything gaming takes away your time and.
Your attention and that's one of the.
Most important things you need for a.
Relationship so if you're a hardcore.
Gamer and you want to have a.
Relationship really think about it.
Before you get into one you're probably.
Gonna have to sacrifice something things.
Are gonna change.
I'm not saying it's not possible to have.
Both there's always a balance but trust.
Me something has got to give and it's.
Just not gonna be the same so unless.
He's behind for a little bit just.
Protect me okay i'll admit it i did.
Forget that i agreed to go shopping with.
You today but um in my defense i do.
Recall saying i didn't want to really is.
It that much to ask you spend a few.
Hours with me together well i mean we.
Spend tons of hours together why does it.
Have to be out shopping like.
Need anything new we own that we have.
Groceries it's not about shopping it's.
About spending quality time together.

Do is play your stupid little games.
Their stupid friends why can't we just.
Spend quality time together here doing.
What playing your games well yeah i mean.
