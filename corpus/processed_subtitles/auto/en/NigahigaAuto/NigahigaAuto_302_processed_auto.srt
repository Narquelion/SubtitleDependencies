Dear right you do parkour here right you.
Do parkour here ryan do parkour ryan.
Parker on parkour kumar clark so this is.
Probably no definitely the most common d.
Ryan that i get all the time every.
Single time i posted your id video and.
I've actually done things kind of.
Similar to parkour but i've never.
Actually really done it because well i i.
Just i don't know how to do it.
Iii can't do parkour ever since i was a.
Little kid i've always dreamt that i.
Would one day learn parkour but you know.
No matter how many times i tried over.
And over and over again i just just.
Could never seem to get it you know i.
Remember this one obstacle in particular.
This dinosaur in the middle of the park.
Was you know the hardest thing i've ever.
Had to do and i could just never figure.
It out i could never get over it i could.
Never learn parkour if i could not.
Defeat this dinosaur i always thought.
One day i would i never did and just.
Made me realize that you know it doesn't.
Matter how much you want something it.
Doesn't matter how hard you try some.
Dreams some dreams just don't come true.
You know what no forget everything i.
Said earlier if you have a dream you.
Chase after it as impossible as it may.
Seem even if it seems like it's a it'll.
Take a miracle to get it done miracles.
Aren't possible at one point it was.
Considered a miracle that electricity.
Was possible or america without we could.
Travel through space even the idea of.
The internet was a miracle and yet we.
Still accomplished all those because.
There's nothing in this world that's.
Impossible till you believe it is so.
Never give up on your dreams because.
There's no obstacle that you can.
Overcome make a miracle happen defeat.
Your dinosaur.
