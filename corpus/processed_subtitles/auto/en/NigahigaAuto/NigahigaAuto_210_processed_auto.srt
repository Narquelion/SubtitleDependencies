I've been preparing for zombies for a.
While can ghosts be racist i'm pretty.
Time five just test everybody test first.
Testing test tests good tests testicles.
Testicles by p claps yeah get started.
Okay let's get right back to it but.
Before we do that welcome back to.
Another episode of auth appeal podcast.
We have very special guest he's not.
Really special.
No i was gonna say we're gonna will and.
Greg but wills always here greg is the.
Special guest today yes come on okay.
Well okay normally he's he puts the clap.
He was you know that's that's what he.
Gets because of you you weren't prepared.
Plague.
Say my name london will is also good.
Yeah okay i just wanted to get the intro.
All the way because what are you talking.
About waiting me introduce me know.
That's why does he get that thing no i.
Don't know are you yeah it was supposed.
To be for me i just didn't get the seed.
Yeah i don't get my decisions here set.
This whole thing up for you guys and you.
Guys ruined it all yeah well you know.
What that is this is what you guys do.
And when i'm not around yeah this is.
Yeah paco pretty much just takes the.
Good job i need to add i wanted to do a.
Person to do things we could add yeah.
That would be nice and put it next to.
You the surprise i think we should be.
Discussing outside of the pocket people.
Are gonna be like and we need a new.
Table yeah in this complaining hour.
Right now we're just gonna whine about.
All right to work in progress it is yeah.
Okay so greg's never been you weren't.
Even on it when we first started i never.
Even watched these things yeah it's too.
Long anyway the reason why greg is never.
Has never been on a podcast is most of.
The time greg is editing oh yeah pretty.
Much all the time that's the only reason.
Why and if he's on here he's not editing.
He's not editing we're probably gonna be.
An additional an additional week behind.
So that's true but then but then this.
Week i think we're gonna make it work.
Yeah no mmm well will said no but he's.
Doing editing this one but that's always.
A tough far with these podcasts because.
We're not gonna miss a week so like i i.
Don't know if we should talk about the.
Video that we're about to put out cuz i.
Don't know if it's gonna be out yet just.
.
Well it won't it won't mean it needs to.
Be out it's like the biggest most.
Largest amount of footage we've had yeah.
On one person in a really long time yeah.
It needs to be out oh you mean this last.
Video yeah the video coming out yeah no.
I mean we can talk about it like tape i.
Mean we pretty much exposed the ardon.
Thing before the video came out which.
Kind of made the video not make sense.
But it's the worst intro ever it is.
We're not talking about anything now on.
That is complaining oh yeah where's the.
One wearing give me some.
Yeah we decided to do a four-person.
Podcast today don't worry we're gonna.
Get a dana yin at some point we wanted.
To keep greg and dana separate though.
They're not the same person hey they're.
Not like twins we're there the same.
I'm just kidding we get that all that.
Wins that we're related you're twins you.
See that you're related yeah actually.
Well know what i don't see that at all i.
Mean because of racism yeah they're both.
Short dana it's pretty hairy just jump.
Into some of these stands what kind of.
Topics we guys i want to try and do.
Something different this week we didn't.
Really get to do it you said last week.
Yeah but we jumped in it with ian that's.
Why but i want to try and do something.
Where like you know at the start of the.
Podcast just to get it rolling a little.
Bit better since our second half is.
Always better i wanted to try and see if.
We could start off like with what made.
You laugh the hardest most recent cuz.
Then you kind of get the giggles going.
And then you kind of get into.
Storytelling mode and you're ready to.
Just alright you start then all right.
Idea definitely get alright well that's.
Life the funniest thing to me this week.
Was interacting with ryan's dad because.
At the last video we're outside and it.
Was really cold for us at least and it.
Was outside it was in the 40s but for.
Ryan's dad he's from hawaii which is a.
Lot warmer so we were like he asked oh.
What's the temperature and we're like oh.
It's it's about like 40 degrees and he's.
Like what no it's not and then we pulled.
Out a phone and showed him 40 degrees.
And he goes yeah but that was in your.
Pocket so it's probably warmer in there.
And we all started dying cuz he thought.
It was a thermometer and it was the.
Greatest it was the greatest thing well.
You have to understand he has a flip.
Phone still doesn't know how to answer.
Calls he knows how to send calls which.
Is a huge upgrade over the past couple.
Years he doesn't he doesn't answer any.
Of my calls or.
My mom's and he yeah i mean that he only.
Can make calls i don't know why he.
Doesn't answer it yeah.
Just outside you saw me uh what the sd.
Cards for the cameras and he was like.
What is that and i was like oh this is.
Like this before the cameras this is.
What we film on this is a film he said.
No i didn't hear this story yeah i'm.
Pretty sure he is did not understand.
Technology at all like he probably.
Couldn't turn on a computer i can't.
Actually probably i would like to see it.
Well it's he's a rare breed that of.
People who don't understand technology.
That's whatever how about you guys what.
Is something that made you laugh really.
Hard recently no honestly depressing.
Week for me nobody laughs here yeah i.
Mean i wish you would have told us your.
Asses like you were really prepared or.
We aren't yeah you think i want to try.
Something new that i thought i've been.
Prepared yeah but uh yeah you guys feel.
Good on the spot no i have nothing that.
I can think of right now that is the.
Thing that i like that is yeah but then.
That again that leads us right back to.
What we are not sure we're gonna talk.
About which i think we can let's just.
Say it go for it yes.
It probably will be out right we'll know.
It'll be out so we did a ryan tries.
Ghost hunting video and it's kind of.
Based off of and inspired by ghost.
Adventures.
I just always wanted to do that i don't.
Know if you guys actually i didn't ask.
You guys what you guys believe in ghosts.
We talked about are we talking about.
Before or after our experience no i mean.
Okay before and after has it changed you.
Do you believe in ghosts it's changed a.
Little bit for me i would say how so.
From the video from this last video from.
The last video yeah because you know.
Like for mia i don't have any hard.
Evidence that they did exist i don't.
Have any hard evidence that they didn't.
Exist i don't know what yeah and so i.
Just like i was just going into it with.
An open mind like we'll see what happens.
You know so you didn't really i know you.
Don't have evidence buyer did you.
Believe.
I was more inclined to be open to the.
Idea of ghosts after that oh yeah.
What oh was it just like the whole.
Experience yeah kind of like certain.
Things that just couldn't be explained.
Like what that wow how does that happen.
Yeah yeah okay i was like i don't know.
Why i thought you were very like ghostly.
Yeah like super believer even before.
That yeah yeah i just get scared very.
Easily but that's me greg does too i'm a.
Scaredy cat for sure and that experience.
Just kind of solidified it for me yeah.
That whole thing was just it was i felt.
Like going into it it was kind of like a.
Gimmick thing like i thought it was.
Gonna be just like this cheesy tour that.
We take and people were gonna be kind of.
Like you know overhyping it but man i'm.
A firm believer now i'm relieved before.
Though no extra firm yeah i mean i.
Always just had it i mean i believe in a.
Lot of things it's a ghost is you smile.
Those things that are one of the things.
I believe i believe in in and zombies.
I've been preparing for zombies for a.
While so like seriously i mean you.
Believe that there's it's a possibility.
Sure or that they already exist no not.
It could already exist but i mean it's a.
Possibility that they could happen i.
Guess it's just fun to kind of keep that.
In the back of my mind and prepare for.
It yeah i guess so.
Me yeah go ahead i feel like i'm pretty.
Neutral on it still i feel like last.
Time we talked about it i feel very much.
The same way like i'm not gonna.
Discredit people from having their own.
Experiences so that's why i can't really.
Say like oh they don't exist like i'm.
Not gonna be like you know paco had this.
Experience and say that wasn't real.
Because obviously it was real to him i.
Just haven't had like a personal.
Experience right and and going there at.
That tour it was really it was fun like.
It was a really awesome experience to.
Like play with the tools and like get to.
All the tools that you see on like those.
Ghosts exactly.
Yeah was it called a dick that's go spa.
Talk ball yeah that was crazy box yeah.
All those things it was just like it's.
Very interesting.
Yeah they had like five devices that.
Each one did something different yeah.
And it's cool to see what each one did.
Yeah yeah so i don't know i'm still.
Maybe i'm like a little bit in leaning a.
Little bit more towards believing after.
That experience because everything adds.
Up to what you know your all your.
Experiences let's you know create your.
Whatever you believe in but for me i.
Don't know that you never so that you.
Never had any personal experiences.
That's why you're i mean that's cool.
Yeah yeah i mean i was i wouldn't say.
That i was a super skeptic i mean i told.
The story already on the other podcast.
Yeah about my experience so i'm not.
Gonna go through that again but like i.
Was you know growing up in hawaii sean.
And i used to go sun all the time and we.
Used to go like all the most haunted.
Spots everywhere all the legends never.
Saw anything so i never believed and.
Then just randomly that one night.
Happened and i kind of leaned the other.
Way but i'm even then even before we did.
The tour i was still kind of uh.
I don't know kind of skeptic right even.
When she brought that the other devices.
I was like man they could have easily.
Tampered with this stuff to make it.
Maybe somebody's like controlling it but.
Then there was some just some things.
Like paco said i i couldn't really.
Explain this doesn't make sense right so.
That was a little freaky i think there's.
One experience that we'll had that you.
Didn't really share with people with the.
The box that when it kind of like.
Glitched out and the battery died yeah.
Well i mean it's it was one that well i.
Mean we'll try to put in the video but.
It was we never really had like an.
Ending to that segment really yeah.
That's like the scary part because it.
Just kind of ended and we're all like.
Wait what just happened yeah like.
Basically there was like a tool that it.
Was like a dictionary of words and.
Somehow like through energy or whatever.
The its they think that the ghost can.
You know essentially manipulate the.
Device to pick a certain word it's kind.
Of a modern-day ouija board yeah exactly.
Exactly without you having to spell it.
Out like they just like text it to you.
Yeah and so when we were like it just we.
Were really like into finding this.
Ryan was getting like a big meter and.
Like the device was going off and then.
All of a sudden like we hadn't really.
Had too much activity on this thing this.
Thing like goes crazy and it put out.
Like six or seven words and i can only.
Pick out like two or three but two of.
Them were japanese and present and i.
Immediately thought like okay of course.
They're like they're understanding that.
We have a lot of japanese people here.
And they're saying that you're japanese.
Well to me i instantly thought like made.
Me think i talk very well this was like.
Would they be okay with that because.
Like really it's like a they're from a.
Completely yeah time no no that's what i.
Was saying i was like because there was.
Also before that it was like believe or.
Like go or not what was it was like it.
You're like not in the way there was.
Something there's other words i really.
Believe yeah so and then i was thinking.
Like okay this is okay this place was.
Built or around in 1913 and you know.
That's like around the time when that's.
Not around the time but let's say these.
People you know we're 20 years old or 30.
Years old and this it's around what.
World world war two yeah right well is.
That 1949 which is very poor not it was.
Around then those people could have been.
Around then and that's when you know the.
Japanese bombed pearl harbor i mean it.
Could be some animosity i don't know.
Yeah i was probably the most japanese.
People in that here's the real question.
Soundbite you ready can ghosts be racist.
Shoot i mean for their time make sense.
Cuz yeah they didn't have pc culture.
Back then yeah well i mean they probably.
Had their version of it yes probably.
Super inappropriate but that's exactly.
What i thought like immediately as i saw.
I saw it no way hmm.
Like i really thought about that like if.
You know different time yeah there's a.
Completely different time like would.
That affect them how they want in.
Interact with you know people know it's.
Kind of crazy it is crazy.
So alright well if you guys were ghosts.
And you you could select what time era.
That you could haunt and where what.
Would it be.
Select look correct question i'm errol.
You type that out.
No i'm just talking about goes will be.
You know so we're trying to keep this.
Podcast under 60 minutes um yeah i would.
Probably hunt right now hunt you guys.
We're asking that question would you.
Just start just keep unplugging each.
Other's mics i don't know we always have.
Issues when we start podcasts from.
Whatever reason there might be a ghost.
Thing one of the shaun's ghosts like.
He's not dead but he just has a ghost or.
We just suck at audio equipment yeah.
That's really mean dude why would you.
Say that about sean what whoa what do.
You say you're going too dark you said.
Something about sean being dead i like.
What nobody hears anyway that actually.
Could lead to her another topic we want.
To bring up is very dark man this is.
Started off pretty dark how do you how.
Did you guys feel and hear about the.
Whole momona thing.
Oh just hearing that word mmm that was.
The name of my brothers cat by the way.
Yeah when i was in videos normal so we.
Put up the cap of momo in the podcast.
Okay right now it's scary uh anyway um.
The first i mean i saw it on my facebook.
Timeline and it's one of the i don't get.
Scared easily.
Yeah but i just was scrolling i was just.
Like what like i thought was one my.
Friends like they edited their photos or.
Whatever apparently was this was a.
Sculpture or something like that art.
Piece of some sort yeah japanese art.
Piece.
Yeah but it was very i actually felt.
Weird by it.
Like i was like i don't want to see this.
You don't get scared easily yep but um.
It's good art it was a hoax right it was.
Like reported supposedly supposedly.
People believed that it would get.
Younger kids or audiences to do.
Dangerous challenges that could lead to.
Death such as like turning the gas stove.
On and then just letting get was ruffolo.
It was reported on that someone in.
Sacramento raised some lady in.
Sacramento had a daughter who said that.
A gregan one 6a anyway they she had a.
Daughter supposedly.
That turned on the gas stove because a.
Youtube video of momo told her to do.
That personally is like a moment.
Challenge or something like that i don't.
Know but it was it was debunked that.
That person was making that up.
Wow that's crazy it's actually a.
Challenge huh challenge yeah people were.
Saying that oh this is such a basically.
People were it i feel like it was like.
That lady was just like or i don't know.
Who it was who started it was just like.
Hey i want like some kind of attention.
Like i can't believe like somebody you.
Know what people like to post i can't.
Believe this is what's wrong with the.
World or whatever like those kind of.
Polls i don't know i i'm trent a lot of.
Older people these girls like they'd.
Like to be outraged.
Yeah i'll read yeah or something but.
That's like that's i mean i when i saw.
Those like dan that's crazy but like she.
Does like that could actually happen now.
That could start because somebody.
Created that that whole you know i mean.
Yeah it's so there's no reported.
Incidences of like actual things that.
Happen right not yet not not according.
To the articles that i read or anything.
Like that.
Yeah not that i know of that is scary i.
Think it just it's really a shame too.
Because it kind of sheds like negative.
Light a little bit on youtube in a sense.
To people who don't really maybe maybe.
Someone will never know about this being.
A hoax you know like from older.
Generation wherever and now they have.
You know it's kind of giving them.
Another reason to not i mean that's kind.
Of what i think when i hear it is like.
Meant that it i'm glad it's a hoax of.
Course but it's like it's kind of kind.
Of unfortunate you know it's kind of.
Like i don't know do you guys remember.
Any like hoaxes or stuff when you were a.
Kid cuz i don't even know if there were.
Hoaxes or not but i remember as a kid my.
Mom would constantly get these emails.
That would alert her like kids in like.
Western us have been getting getting.
Dealt drugs that are passed off as pop.
Rocks and then when you eat them like it.
Can be so strong that children die and.
So she would be like you can't eat pop.
Rocks anymore i never heard of that yeah.
So that's why i don't know if those are.
Ever real or if those are hoaxes seems.
Like the same kind of thing though yeah.
But there was a one thing that isn't a.
Hoax that sounds like one and it's call.
Jenkum have you guys ever heard that.
Right kinkos jake oh geez.
Jenga jenkem jenkum jumbles.
Yeah and it's it's a hallucinating drug.
Where people would pee and poop into a.
Balloon and then smell it afterwards oh.
You get high off of the pm poop smell.
Something like it like for men's or.
Something like that and like like that a.
Porta potty yeah so people go into a.
Port-a-potty he's gonna start breathing.
Like this is a hoax to get people to go.
Into portable and smell poop some people.
Learn to feet some people aren't sap in.
Poop apparently i mean that's all yeah.
That's a hundred percent it's that i.
Remember like actually think about that.
So i mean if i'm wrong i'm wrong i mean.
Don't knock it until you try.
No we are not condoning that duke duke.
Moonshine oh my gosh yeah don't try it.
Is this a joke.
In the mid 1990s it was reported to be a.
Popular street drug amongst zambian.
Street children what does ambien zambo.
Do an exam i don't know bone really bad.
With yogurt geez well i mean on the momo.
Topic that artists kudos to them for.
Making something so yeah gary yeah last.
Time i was scared of a face like that.
Was probably like uh like the grudge.
Face or something like yeah i've been.
Scared i've been swiped past pictures of.
My feet so fast ever since like i was in.
High school of your feet my feet wow.
Holy cow no but i mean that's that's one.
Of the reasons why i was like kind of.
Impressed that you came i mean like i.
Get i asked you i was like are you.
Willing to film this ghost-hunting.
Episode because i know yeah more than.
Anyone in the group greg is probably the.
Most afraid of those babies dana maybe.
Dana no i.
Cuz dena came with us to watch the.
Conjuring - greg what greg i mean he.
Wasn't there but i'm sure he would not.
Have wanted to go watch that tina did i.
Don't even like watching the movies you.
Guys watch like conjuring all that i.
Said you don't come with us.
I hate those movies they're scary.
Yeah do you think what um i guess it's.
Because you're a believer i think it's.
Just like all right so i'm not scared of.
Like just aam be sand werewolves and.
Vampires cuz like you can you can fight.
Those things right but like ghosts and.
Stuff like they're demons.
Yeah i'm defenseless eminence i can't do.
Anything towards them that's why i.
Thought about like chucky's like i mean.
It was a scary movie it as a kid but.
When i got yeah a little toy like if it.
Kills me i deserve to die but same wait.
Like the grudge girl i was like dude.
This little tour the ring girl i was.
Like if she crawls it on my tv i was.
Like thinking like you know like in a.
Scary movie 3 where she crawled through.
The tv and then what's that lady the.
Black girl on that she starts beating.
Her ass and i was just like that's.
Exactly how i think it would go you know.
If you died to this little girl.
It was decomposed i mean like she's like.
She should be able to break you know i.
Mean like your skin's breaking your.
Bones probably rotting she probably.
Smells like that zimbabwe weird we don't.
Know things you're also probably doing.
Judo when you watch out huh you were.
Probably mean i mean i definitely was.
But yeah i was like i see how she would.
Come at me and i'm already playing home.
I'm gonna take her down get behind her.
I'd snap her neck chris is there such.
Thing as a dude judo chop there's no.
Such thing as a judo chop actually you.
Know what if someone's grabbing your.
Lapel yeah you could chop your hand down.
But it's not a real thing that's not.
What he says judo chop there's no judo.
Kick either come on austin powers come.
On.
They done did life is a lie yeah but.
Anyway i just thought it was um i was.
Kind of shocked so even at some points.
Because greg will go off and get.
Equipment and you know do things on his.
Own without anybody else around the.
Other night when we were filming i was.
That you were like just going off on.
Your own i turned on like when i get.
Into film mode yeah i just don't even.
Think anymore just like autopilot yeah i.
Was just filming so the crazy thing was.
When i was filming later on down to.
During the day like we just kept having.
Camera equipment failure like our.
Batteries kept dying and stuff like that.
And that was the stuff that was creeping.
Me out of broken me out of my you know.
My yeah yeah that's like wait all these.
Stuff is charged and i just keeps dying.
Yeah and that never happened yeah it.
Never happens and he said it might.
Because it's supposedly like the ghosts.
Are pulling energy from you know.
Electronics or whatever and paco's phone.
Went off randomly even though he had.
Full service and even then i was still.
Skeptical i was like okay what if they.
Have a device that's making our like a.
Dj exactly yeah but then my phone was.
Fine the whole time everybody else it.
Was just like random you know moments.
That we didn't even get to get on camera.
A lot of times cuz it was just like.
We're setting up yeah it was old i was.
Getting i was getting scared that we.
Weren't gonna be able get to shot.
Honestly because i was like i have two.
Batteries they died instantly.
And i have to use this specific infrared.
Camera to get these shots and it was.
Like kind of that was making me scared.
Like yeah i want to get this shot so i.
Can't so i don't know i feel like you.
Could fight a ghost oh sage but when you.
Cross when you think about it like when.
There is a ghost most times they're just.
Scaring you like it you don't hear about.
A ghost like killing anyone that's true.
Yeah maybe like if it's a demon and you.
Got possessed but how often do you hear.
About that in your life yeah or same.
With most times it's somebody you know.
Just scaring getting scared because they.
Saw something but they'd never like oh.
It grabs my hair it's like well okay.
That's not even assault.
Yeah actually i don't know that's.
Probably a song if someone like touched.
Your hair like well i mean i don't want.
To get too much into the video because.
We're just giving away the whole thing.
Yeah just in case but how about this.
Then instead of talking about this video.
Let's talk about the is synergy between.
Both greg and ryan so a lot of people.
Losses the process yeah yeah and how how.
Well you guys work together.
Um so like with a lot of the videos most.
Ryan will write the full scrip have like.
Some wild ideas cuz like he said another.
Podcast he likes to push his ideas and.
See like oh is this possible make i want.
To try something new every time and.
He'll come up to greg and greg is.
Someone who never says no he just i was.
Like yeah okay we can do that yeah so.
Speaking on that even just recently i.
Made over he was fixing another edit and.
I just text him randomly i had this idea.
And basically i was just like hey do you.
Think it's possible to do this.
And before you mean i had a chance to.
Answer i was like wait i have to.
Rephrase that because greg is always.
Gonna say it's possible cuz you'll find.
A way but it's a matter of like okay is.
This gonna be worth us putting the time.
Into and yeah because greg always.
Figures out how to do anything it might.
Take two months yeah but you'll figure.
It out just like we i mean like i mean.
We let's talk about it like cuz there's.
Some videos like i wasn't too worried.
About the fortnight one i mean obviously.
There's a lot of effects in that and.
Stuff like that but i ask you is that.
How possible is this to build a entire.
Fort you know do we have to build it in.
Real life.
Frana is it easier to make an effect.
For it yeah um and you says possible so.
I'm like okay but it's a matter of like.
How possible and in a realistic time.
Right right usually it's i i look at the.
Thing on paper or your text message or.
Whatever and on paper looks it looks way.
More doable then you know.
In actuality so yeah iii i often times.
Jump the gun and i usually just say yes.
Just kind of like you know it's just so.
I can start thinking about it because.
Once i know something we're actually.
Gonna do something that's when like my.
Brain kind of starts putting the pieces.
Together and doing all the logistics but.
Sometimes it is impossible.
Yeah but we're too far into it right.
It's like we can't turn back now well so.
Likely a good example is you know on the.
Exposed video yeah the music video we.
Did we're i was just pitching ideas with.
With you and i was like.
This is so much post work like i didn't.
I didn't have an idea for that bridge.
Part i know what i wanted to see i want.
To see all these little screens right as.
We're spinning around which we did but i.
Didn't know how it was and then your.
Idea you're like oh and what if all.
Those screens ends up being you i was.
Like yeah yeah that's awesome and.
Because you said it i was like okay then.
It's doable.
Yeah but i mean and you did you did it.
Yeah i mean most of times the effects.
And stuff that we do i mean it's there.
Me see all over hollywood all the time.
Like anything is possible nowadays.
Especially with today's technology what.
They have a lot of time and yes that's.
What yeah that's what kind of holds us.
Back it's just you know like technology.
Manpower and just time overall and but.
Like the ideas that's kind of like where.
I guess me and ryan kind of shine.
Because he'll write something and i will.
Kind of see it a completely different.
Way and we don't really combine our.
Ideas until like midway when we're kind.
Of we both got an idea of where we're.
Heads are at.
So sometimes it's like two completely.
Different videos or two completely.
Different ideas coming together mm-hmm.
And sometimes it works sometimes it.
Sometimes it's you know sometimes it's.
Like mid like filming yeah like oh this.
Is not what i was exactly but for.
Whatever we it ends up most times we try.
To at least make it work yeah even if.
That means getting rid of something yeah.
But i mean that's that's usually the.
Process for that for the most part yeah.
Sometimes ryan like fully leaves some.
Sections blank you know like whenever we.
Do like a connection type video like a.
Like a miley cyrus well you call that.
Video like conspiracy conspiracy theory.
I guess yeah when ryan goes into his.
Ryan math stuff where he's just.
Connecting the dots and he doesn't.
Really know how to visually yeah so he.
Just leaves it blank and then you know.
It's up to us to kind of connect.
Together yeah like like if there's no.
Specific direction on those then what a.
Lot of times what greg's good at is.
Figure like visually.
I think you see everything visually yeah.
That's where i see things more like.
Almost like a math equation right right.
And that's why it helps because it's.
Like we're working two different parts.
Of our brains if that makes sense it's.
Like well we're packin de but yeah.
That's uh that's kind of like what yeah.
Mostly the processes like i will say the.
Very first kind of experience that kind.
Of relates to this like your question is.
Like when we first started working with.
Ryan were in los angeles and it was me.
And greg and like i was gonna be.
Starting to do bts and greg was just.
Starting to do effects on first channel.
And it was the i one you were there for.
That yeah you were there for dear ryan.
Can you open your eyes no my first video.
I do know we did your first one i think.
I think with movies and minutes avengers.
That's the first one i like that's the.
One who came out to vegas yeah but that.
One was i feel like new york i literally.
Opened him oh you were like holy cow.
Like i've always had these ideas and i.
Want to do but you couldn't do them on.
Your own so when you had literally like.
The capability to now do these like.
Graphic or cgi kind of bigger ideas.
They're kind of more i don't know you.
Just can't edit them like cutting scenes.
It's like you obviously had to spend.
Time if you're not familiar with it.
Someone where it's dear ryan can you.
Open your eyes and he goes is really.
Really big and greg like made these 3d.
Is too big it destroys the room and the.
Building and then for whatever reason it.
Starts teasing dietrich's you know but.
The thing is that's i didn't even think.
Like even if i could see it in my head.
I've never done anything like that was.
Like how the hell cuz i was on like.
Imovie i think exactly there's no way.
Unless you feel like green screen which.
I kind experimented with did not know.
What i was doing but uh i didn't know.
That was possible and i just open the.
Door for so much work exactly.
So much more time spiraled out of.
Control.
Yep and then we went downhill from there.
Just.
Just stress the stress it's like alright.
Well that i mean that seems like an.
Interesting you guys started talking.
About your origin story almost yeah.
But before we go into our origin story i.
Think it's about time we hit that.
Halfway mark we are we're there already.
Yes we are yeah we were talking about.
Goals for a while huh she should break.
She should break do you guys have to she.
She not she could she she again again i.
Agree the quids you guys she she a.
Balloon ooh try it out and doodle good.
All right she should do the break just.
She should.
All right break change it up a little.
Bit you know what else is something that.
We've changed up what i feel like we've.
Gone to big league like we mean i'm.
About to explain whoa why are you so mad.
Because you cut me off like always.
What does that mean though but uh i.
Think we got two big lis cuz once we got.
One sponsor.
We've never begged for another that is.
True yeah i remember you guys did this.
One podcast where like you guys were.
Trying to get shauna a piping job that's.
No we're trying to get him a.
Volunteering job and i think he actually.
Got a job.
Oh really yeah for real i just talked to.
Him well i don't i i don't know if i.
Should say i don't it's not my place but.
And i don't know for sure but i'm pretty.
I'm pretty sure he may or may not have.
Gotten a job i'm not saying because of.
The podcast by the way it's i he was.
Looking to get a fallen he was trying to.
Just volunteer yeah cuz they weren't.
Letting him volunteer which i thought.
Was weird but it makes sense no but yeah.
He's uh i think he may or may not have.
Gotten a job well maybe congrats sean.
Maybe congrats john so kind of like man.
We're back and we're back yeah they said.
That nobody sees that part yeah what.
Were you talking about.
We'll watch you beg for a sponsor real.
Quick and then we could jump in here.
Orange this is the part where we're.
Supposed to be like hey and thank you so.
Much to something we're sponsoring this.
Shishi break yeah i think that turns.
Away sponsors to be that we call it a.
Shisha break hell i don't even know what.
It is okay let's keep it that way then.
Yeah we explained it though before yeah.
But they don't watch the befores they.
Just look at the views oh good yeah yeah.
Those went down let's talk about yeah we.
I guess we could bring up origin story.
Again the one thing that i read the most.
Was how did you guys meet and it kind of.
Includes all three of you yeah it.
Includes more than me a lot it's like a.
Lot of people so this is the real story.
Because we made the animated thing that.
Was i mean it was it was in the right.
Order kind of it was kind of the story.
But i was like a joke but i'm not a.
Stripper so many people have asked and.
Be like you were a stripper and you took.
That seriously no but the people took it.
Serious that's why i was i think they.
Did i think the joke no they actually.
Asked they think you they really think.
They thought you were super but i'm like.
Look at my body do i look like i have.
The value for that yeah you're very.
Muscular probably pay a couple bucks.
Yeah yeah i mean you ain't gonna do it.
Right now ain't gonna do it i can't cuz.
If i show my legs it'll deter ad we.
Don't need legs continue with this.
Anyway we can um i'll let you guys i.
Mean you guys can tell it if you i can.
Fill in the blanks but i mean yeah greg.
Was first so um so it all started oh man.
Maybe like back in i want to say junior.
High when we used to go to school.
Together me will i didn't go to junior.
High with you oh that's right high.
School yeah high school high school what.
We all kind of lived in the same area we.
Were me we'll dana.
We're from sacramento california which.
Is where dominic d-trix and a few others.
Are they're all we're all kind of like.
From a certain area and we grew up.
Together we went to the same high school.
Together.
And eventually we started a dance group.
Called the step boys as a hit was a.
Hip-hop dance crew shoutout ya know it.
Originated with uh you know a few guys.
And then eventually we picked up will we.
All started dancing with us and in.
Addition to will it was d-trix and that.
Was when we kind of took dance seriously.
And we started training we started doing.
Competitions and dance was like our main.
Jam and then dom got so good at dancing.
He actually went on to a few shows he.
Went on to left us he did leave us and.
Yeah well we actually sent him away we.
Were like you're so good we're holding.
You back please don't go i mean please.
Go do this thing and he did he went and.
Killed it and he did yeah we can't he.
Was like we were so freakin like proud.
Of how like cuz we never would thought.
Like one of the people that we were with.
If you don't know he went to america's.
No first he went to so you think you can.
Dance so you think he danced that's what.
It was yeah yeah and i don't know he.
Just like did so well on it and came.
Back it didn't win but he made a name.
For himself first yeah for sure and from.
There he went on to america's best dance.
Crew with quests which should have been.
Step boys okay he was at that time he.
Moved to la and you know he had like his.
Yeah he had a lot of good dancer friends.
Out there and yeah they're all amazing.
They're all like really good guys so and.
They won and they were we would have but.
Later on down the road like we're like.
Man if dietrich's can do it we could do.
It that stuff it's easy bro so we.
Actually did trial and we did guys made.
The show i was at that audition - yeah i.
Think suppose of the you guys beat out.
Derek's crew yes it's true so that's.
Another one it's fallen king yes derek.
Was in a he was also a dancer also.
Actually he is a dancer he's dancing.
Right now.
Yeah and he was actually someone that we.
All looked up to when we saw dancing in.
Sacramento he was like a professional.
Breakdancer that we were all like when.
He.
We saw him i was like kind of.
Intimidated by him and now i hate him i.
Could already see derek in china.
Listen to this when you say no we.
Actually did like super look up to him.
Though he was i'm he was super dope he.
Was a traveling like dancer and they.
Would go to other countries and they.
Would win yeah and like we like we would.
Have never been able to do that kind of.
Stuff cuz we weren't the best dancers.
But we could make good shows yeah we was.
Our forte performers you guys are known.
As the funny guys we really clowns yeah.
Like literally circus clowns you made.
Other dance crews laugh yeah pretty much.
It's all about entertainment that's what.
You guys were known for then when you.
Are on america's best dance crew like.
Your logo was a mustache and like you.
Were the mascot basically yeah and it.
Was not about like oh you guys can do.
The best flips or you guys have the best.
Stunts there's a little bit of.
Everything but the things you guys have.
Was comedy mm-hmm yeah the producers.
Actually hated us what yeah you did dom.
Dom was he was the judge at the gym on.
The show i'm like the waitress he would.
Kind of tell us like you know behind the.
Scenes stuff and he was like yeah you.
Guys might need to step up your game.
Because the producers they're like they.
Really want you guys off the show we.
Could dance let's show them so yeah we.
Would you know put on girl costumes and.
Make a fool of ourselves but at this and.
Then they kick us off at the same time.
We we had a we had as like it was like a.
Really good learning experience and it.
Was it was fun and after the show we all.
Kind of uh you know we needed to figure.
It out and at that time dom and ryan.
Were living together cuz you guys met.
How did you guys meet again i meant dom.
Through victor actually so same quest.
Through quest.
I met dom yeah through victor i don't.
Know why i met victory through wong foo.
There short that they were doing and.
Then we just happened to get in touch.
And i was like oh you guys are on this.
Show you guys are like dope anyway me.
And victor kept in touch he introduced.
Me to quest.
And just naturally i just like got along.
With dom and like his his style of.
Comedy and stuff like that so we he.
Ended up coming out a couple of times.
And we hung out steve terada came out.
And then we just kept in touch yeah.
Pretty much i was going to live in la.
And vegas at the same time and i ended.
Up getting an apartment with him in.
North hollywood and then that's where i.
Guess that goes back to you right not.
You yeah i was like maybe here's that.
Maybe the year before and i think i met.
You twelve wasn't tendon okay dana would.
Know yeah anyway so yeah it was after a.
Bdc and like youtube was a pretty big.
Upcoming thing for dom and you know he.
Wanted to spend more time and effort.
Into it and i was always like confused.
About it because i actually studied.
Video for school i went to college for.
Digital media and my plan was to you.
Know do video and then i saw i hear dom.
Getting into this youtube thing he's.
Doing good and like yeah and he was like.
Great what kind of camera should i get.
And why do you want why do you want this.
Expensive camera i was getting a little.
Salty because you know i was like saving.
Up all my allowance i didn't get.
Allowance and i was just like really.
Excited to get like this you know these.
This equipment that dom was just picking.
Up like nothing he had like no interest.
And no he was just getting it for this.
Youtube thing i had no interest in.
Youtube at the time so i was like okay.
Well yeah well if you're just you know.
You need this equipment to do this you.
Need this editing stuff and basically i.
Was kind of helping dom in his early.
Youtube career and i guess from there he.
And or you guys were getting really into.
Youtube and you guys formed like rights.
Yeah and all that yeah and you guys.
Needed kind of more help getting stuff.
Out so dom offered me you know a place.
To stay and out in la to help him.
Produce some videos.
It they'll do some stuff like that so.
You know i didn't have anything planned.
But to try and dance some more so i was.
Just gonna you know i finished my i.
Finished school and then i was like okay.
Yeah i just made the leap to move out to.
La and hope you guys yeah i think like a.
Pretty big piece of it as well that we.
Didn't mention was when we were younger.
Like when we first started hanging out.
Right in step boys i was probably like i.
Don't know 15 or 16 when i first met.
Them and we really like greg was he was.
Like really always into like filming and.
Editing and essentially he had like this.
Group of literally clowns right so we.
Would make these really stupid funny.
Videos for each other which was what we.
Did we didn't use youtube but you would.
He would make them on cds i would make.
Them into like yeah dvds we'd give them.
To people yeah yeah and that was kind of.
Like our version like we weren't on.
Youtube then but that was like what we.
Were doing so that was like the.
Correlation between dom.
Knowing greg's value you know because he.
Was the one that filmed and edited it.
And liked it it was just really stupid.
Stuff like that we used to do it was.
Like typical you exactly like early 2005.
Exactly like this jackass type stuff.
Yeah like just some stupid skits yeah.
And so that was kind of the correlation.
Between dom using greg is like or.
Wanting to hire him in a sense because.
He knew he was that was what he was into.
It was really good at it and and then.
Well i mean you were living with us.
Spike you were you were literally on our.
Couch times we didn't we had to it was a.
Two-bedroom place me and dom in a room.
You were just living on our couch and.
The couch was not that big it was i'm.
Pretty tom five five and that couch was.
Like two inches too short for me so i.
Constantly had to sleep like with a.
Little kink in my leg and i'm pretty.
Sure i got some back problems to be fair.
Yeah it was a really nice place it was.
It wasn't that rough it was we were.
Coming from where we were like stepboys.
Yeah it was like it's pretty nice.
Wait so did you both move to la at the.
Same time right gregg moved before me he.
Was because like this point after a bdc.
Like i didn't go on the show i was still.
In college and we were all like getting.
To the point we were really figuring out.
We were like kind of becoming adults a.
Little bit we were figuring out like.
What we wanted to do do we want to keep.
Pursuing dance professionally gregg was.
Like finishing college so is he gonna do.
Dance or film like everyone was kind of.
In that phase and so gregg had like.
After the show you know there we work.
Might have like done professional in you.
Know moving to la and stuff like that.
Trying to do more dance but gregg got.
This opportunity to do film with them.
And went ahead and then i remember it.
Was like pretty like a specific time.
Where gregg came back and was like this.
Is what i'm doing and he hit we had like.
This talk with all stepboys about like.
You know you know push harder like let's.
Do some stuff like if you want to do a.
Dance if you want to be a dancer and.
Move to la and dance like we had like.
This you know as a serious talk and i.
Remember thinking like okay i need to.
Make it change and you know and it.
Motivated everyone to like lit the fire.
And so i just took the leap and i trant.
I was gonna transfer to la and so i.
Moved to la i don't know how many months.
After that would have been probably for.
Three or four months and i just had just.
Took the leap and i was gonna transfer.
School out there and continue my you.
Know college education and so that's why.
I like i came after yeah but i was like.
The instigator i was trying move out the.
Entire dance crew because they were like.
My only friends i didn't know anyone out.
In la i didn't have no money yeah i.
Didn't have like anyone only when i had.
Was dahm dahm was like you know my.
Saving grace but he was also the only.
One only friend that i knew out there.
Yeah so it was kind of a risky jump i.
Mean it was just like something that i.
Was terrified of you know i was leaving.
All my family all my friends and all for.
This youtube thing that there was.
Nothing involved with it there was like.
I didn't know if i was gonna get paid i.
Didn't know if i was gonna if there's.
Gonna be a career that i can actually.
Make money off of or you know be.
Financially stable from but at the same.
Time i kind of just knew that it was.
Something something i don't know i think.
It was just the like it was exactly what.
I wanted to do i didn't want to work for.
A big company but i also wanted to make.
Some big stuff like i didn't want to be.
Held back creatively and i felt like.
This kind of it checked all the checks.
That i needed in life besides the.
Paycheck so like i was i was like okay.
You know i'll figure out the money stuff.
Later as long as i get to make some dope.
Stuff on in video and you know this is.
Gonna be worth it yeah so i was like.
Yeah we'll come out man like we're gonna.
Get so much money.
We're gonna be alright and i see i.
Actually we actually got a good portion.
Of our dance crew - you know like come.
Out and i mean like jerel he's with uh.
You know he's doing this thing out there.
With dom or he was doing this thing with.
Dom there's green yeah they're all kind.
Of from step boys i mean they are from.
Step boys yeah if you see like you know.
A lot of people that's in dom's videos.
You know that they're probably from.
Sacramento and it's a it's a pretty cool.
Family that sacramento if you don't if.
You've never been there it makes sense.
Because there's nothing to do out there.
So i think that's what we kind of like.
There's nothing to do but hone your.
Crafts and like get better at dancing or.
Video or whatever so it's there's a cool.
Place it was a boring place to live but.
It was also a very like cultured place.
So yeah that's the origin of yeah how we.
Met ryan basically yeah and then yeah to.
Continue the story just a little bit.
Like after greg had moved i had moved.
Shortly after and then like greg said we.
Didn't really know anyone.
So we me and greg we'd hung out like.
Every day yeah and then sometimes since.
Brian was dom's roommate sometimes dom.
Would be somewhere else like super busy.
So we were hanging out with ryan like.
Because he was at the house and our.
Department and and he was obviously.
Working and doing youtube stuff and so.
It literally just put us in the same.
Like literally the same room and it just.
Kind of the same i think the same thing.
That connected dom and.
Since like the sense of humor like.
That's what we shared as well because.
It's it's all from the same dancer.
Essentially we all it's kind of like a.
Malcolm gladwell's outliers in a way.
It's it's a book where it basically.
Talks about how you are at like the.
Prime age the youngest point you could.
Have been to learn all that you could.
And and be in the right place at the.
Right time yeah type of thing i think so.
Yeah yep.
I mean i i'm a firm believer of like.
There's nothing wrong with hard work i.
Mean it never really hurt anyone besides.
You in your own time and you know yeah i.
Do agree if we were in the right place.
At the right time yeah and it is a very.
You know fortunate opportunity for us.
You know ryan dom especially given us.
These opportunities but at the same time.
If it wasn't for us putting in the hard.
Work to get us to be you know have some.
Type of talent in the first place they.
Probably wouldn't have even you know.
Thought of us ago and it just had.
Perfectly lined up too with you because.
You were in a phase of your career where.
You you did want to like like create.
Like a small crew to help you produce.
More on a more constant basis right.
Because if we would have met you like a.
Year before it would probably been.
Completely different right um i think.
Originally i didn't even know greg could.
Do what he could do right effects wise i.
Wanted somebody who could help me shoot.
For one yeah and have another you know.
Bodies around right because it was just.
So hard to do everything by yourself and.
Then when i saw what he could do in.
Terms of like his filming and now it's.
Just like how did you make cuz i would.
Use the camera i would give him my.
Camera sometimes right and he would get.
A shot and i'd be like how did you make.
It look so cinematic oh you know you.
Just do this and this and this and you.
Know he makes the background blurry and.
He's just like i stuff up on my own.
Camera cause i didn't know how to use it.
Right you know and then i was like when.
He kind of showed me that stuff i was.
Like damn there's so much things i did.
Not know what's even possible yeah and.
That's the main reason why i wanted to.
Bring greg on so i think honestly i.
Think it would have happened still with.
Greg because i was just like so.
Intrigued with learning like what else.
Is possible yeah.
Like if we kept every single video if.
You look it's a progression like from.
Year to year.
Does huge jumps in terms of what we were.
Doing and it's not necessary like he.
Couldn't have done great couldn't have.
Done it before it's just i was like.
Literally doing what we do now is like.
Hey is this possible.
How can we do this and you know still.
Keep it within our brand right but it.
That's how it progressed it was a lot of.
I think even you like you know like you.
Couldn't even compare your knowledge now.
To that that version of grey because you.
Learned so much along the way and you.
Just kept you know if you didn't know.
Something you never said no you just.
Looked it up figured it out even if.
Sometimes it was whack compared to what.
You thought i was gonna be or even for.
What i thought was gonna be it's like at.
Least we got it done you know might not.
Have been exactly how we pictured but.
The fact that you figured out how to do.
It is i guess i guess in a way it's it's.
A good and bad thing to say.
Yeah always you're gonna you can make.
This happen yeah that comes from i think.
For sure it comes from step boys and.
Sense of like we we never it was so.
Weird because our our performance is.
Like i said they weren't just dance good.
But somehow we made it happen to where.
Whoever is watching they would either.
Laugh or understand a story you know and.
A big portion of that came from i think.
The mentality that we all breeded and.
Definitely like the older guys for sure.
Of like take this idea and make it.
Happen right i think it's just like you.
Know you can literally make something.
Out of nothing like you don't need to.
Have all the skills you don't need to.
Have talent you know i mean you have.
More so just the willingness and the.
Drive to be able to you know say okay i.
Got this well back then it was like you.
Know if take for example we had this.
Dance crew no one knew how to dance but.
We all wanted seriously we all wanted to.
Put on a good show like we knew what.
Made us smile and what made us like like.
A certain dance performance so we're.
Like okay we'll just tweak our abilities.
And you know get that same kind of.
Moment but with our skill levels yeah so.
Like you know we knew we had one guy.
That i had a that could do a backflip.
It's.
We utilized that guy a lot because he.
Was you know it was it gave that idea.
That the entire crew could do backflips.
Exactly but you know we apply that same.
Kind of idea to video we're not the best.
Video makers or i mean we're far from it.
There's like so many good effects guys.
Camera people but we try to a man we do.
Our best to get a really good you know a.
Professional look but at the same time.
We have the time more than half the time.
69 percent of the time we don't know.
What the heck we're doing 69 percent of.
The time exhausting just to go back on.
To the origin and finish i'll do the.
Fast version yeah.
Just so people understand yes i met greg.
First and it was literally on a per.
Project basis i was just kind of like.
You know it was more dom's friend and.
Then eventually like you know it wasn't.
Consistent enough for you i think to the.
Point where like i was using you more.
Than dom a little white tf slave you.
Were i was getting tossed around.
Actually was it white yet before you.
Started working with who was right.
During like right during white tf is.
When i moved out like the heart of it.
Okay so you came on a little after then.
I guess so yeah okay you were the white.
Tf bts er yeah yeah if someone needed a.
Video in white tf mm-hmm it's probably.
My way and then from there you.
Introduced me to will i mean already.
Kind of we already kind of met but like.
That's where we started hanging out like.
You said we hung out more yeah after.
That we i ended up moving back to vegas.
Because i really did not like living in.
La and you guys came onto and lived at.
The cloth which is the don't the cloth.
Is you know what the cloth is really.
Yeah they've heard us say it before so.
Ok well the club is the first house i.
Lived in vegas and it became it the.
Office essentially i see that coming a.
Lot like what house is this.
Yeah anyway i don't think it's ever been.
Officially addressed as that well the.
Scenes before they're exposed to us.
Anyway from there so willing greg are.
There i think the next person might have.
Been shaun yeah or was it.
Eric was oh yes on visitors no it was.
Sean no sean visited and then he went.
Back he was still in college yeah i.
Think it was sean we were saying you.
Were like around with derek a lot.
Because he already lived in las vegas.
Yeah he was doing his own youtube stuff.
Anyway to help him fort after i'm gonna.
I'm just gonna say sean i think it was.
Sean okay sean finished college and he.
Hit me up well i hit him up to i was.
Just like i always told him from the.
Last time he visited like if you ever.
Want to get back into making some videos.
And stuff like that like come come.
Through you know like we have a place.
Like because they were seeing at the.
House and you know we had some room and.
He says yeah i was i'm interested in.
That i don't think he he what he at the.
Time he was very not interested i think.
He was just so over college yeah he was.
Over school that's why he really wanted.
To do it and then now obviously he's.
Back interested in again but so sean was.
There and then eventually you guys moved.
Out right it was like this weird thing.
Where everybody except derek lived at.
The club yeah yeah at some point anyway.
Sean came in derek had just finished a.
Job that he was working with the job.
Walk he's dancing in a vegas show but it.
Was just about to be renewed or the show.
Was just ending and he had the option to.
Either go be on the show again or i.
Don't know what it was a kid the rien or.
Something or he said hey isaac like i.
Want to edit like this is what i went to.
School for whatever like do you want to.
Another editor so i said okay well um.
Yeah i guess we could bring derek in too.
So he brought in derek from there was it.
Josh josh yeah you know dane oh dana.
Moved out we was it that time i think it.
Was dana was before josh no i don't.
Think so okay well either way josh.
Booher he was a brief period of time but.
He was living out here too met him.
Through internet icon and how was a.
Thing and it's also where i met also.
Where i met paco alumni but yeah i think.
Josh was here for a little bit.
Dana came in because of greg essentially.
She was coming here.
What was the reasoning for coming here i.
Mean design right yeah it was interior.
Design but also you know we're doing.
Like a long term relationship and turn.
Suit for one well we'll talk about that.
Next but uh yeah.
Why'd you say it like that i was like in.
Agreement oh yeah i mean we might have.
To talk about it on a different one sure.
Yeah yeah okay so dana and then josh.
Ended up leaving to go work with his.
Parents net in atlanta or la and then.
Paco the story i don't know have i told.
This story about him coming we were.
Doing i know specifically we were.
Filming skit so that 30-minute skit so.
Was it called halloween one the.
Halloween skit so all my fault and it's.
Okay we'll get to that so paco comes and.
He hits me up you know we kind of know.
Each other.
And then he's like hey man and just want.
To let you know anytime you uh you know.
I would love to come help just i'll.
Drive out and just get some experience.
And i was like all right well we're.
Shooting this really long schizo episode.
Sure and he drove out like i think.
Pretty like soon right after i've rented.
A car yeah you rented a mom okay so.
That's that's one other thing he rented.
A car drove all the way out from la just.
To come be on set and help us for free i.
Wasn't paying him it just came to i was.
Like dan this is a really hard-working.
Cool dude like who does that he kind of.
Reminded me yeah yeah he just like.
Giving up some of his this time and and.
You know just dedicating it towards.
Bettering himself yeah and i was like.
This is very impressive it was like a.
Two-day shoot i believe right no you.
Guys were shooting for four days yeah.
But you hit me up on the first day and i.
Do remember the second day when we're.
Filming at the time i think you fell.
Asleep during the shoot or something.
Like that something like that happened.
And we were all like you know whatever.
Cuz we're free yeah and he drove the.
Whole time yeah i think it was the end.
Of that day because i had just a ride.
And we went to shoot like right away.
Yeah he fell asleep in the shoot and.
Normally i'd be like oh that's if he was.
Working for us but that's weird but.
Little did we know inside well anyway.
We'll of all people was like i was like.
Hey do you think it's worth like week.
Josh just left we could bring this guy.
On board like he we could use the hands.
Like if he edits i know he did at it.
Because he was making videos of his own.
I guess.
Jammed and will was the number one.
Person like fight he was like this is no.
Help yeah because i was like messaging.
Him like a good job when coming out like.
We really appreciate the topic shocked.
Yeah you know if you keep coming around.
Like that's how you know that's how it.
Always his work like derek was gone for.
A long time and he just helped in.
Exactly and then that's exactly what i.
Told him was like you keep coming out.
And killing it like of course you know.
Something's bound to happen you know.
It's like and that's what happened.
But anyway paco ended up being a part of.
The group yeah.
Oh well he's in pocket paco's in and.
That's pretty much how he got in but i.
Think we found because i was always.
Trying to find out i was like okay so.
You don't want to write because what for.
Me like i mean i was like okay so you.
Don't want to edit you have such a.
Specific i do have a very specific are.
You write its i know that's why i.
Writing for ryan is tough it's it takes.
A genius no no it's just big rhino.
Genius guys know it's hard because i'm.
Very particular in what i like might not.
Always make sense to people but it's.
Just i'm just very picky even if it's.
Down to a point one second cut it makes.
A difference to me it does i mean once a.
I will say the last thing that greg was.
Talking about a little bit was like.
Greg's value and it was that he was like.
Super into filming and editing and stuff.
Like that and people recognize that when.
I came on like i didn't do any film i.
Didn't do any editing like we wrote.
Something a little bit in the beginning.
And i think hopefully like i like to.
Think that that probably at least put me.
On the radar but literally if you want.
To.
Learn something it's aunt like online is.
The determination and just wanting to.
Learn something yeah because i learned.
Everything from greg from ryan from.
Online like searching and just like.
Literally just wanting and like pursuing.
It so it's it's possible like i didn't.
Know how to edit i didn't know how to.
Film and motivational podcasts yeah we.
Have those now we are this kind of.
Turned in today just take out the whole.
First half just continue from this book.
Yeah just cause stepboys the movie and.
It's just like about inspiration like.
About a dance crew that didn't know how.
To dance.
And they all ended up doing like kind of.
Big things i don't know everybody but i.
Mean the one guy sings you know some.
Guys became somewhat ographers editors.
Guys a stripper right we have we have.
One of our crew mates that is in the.
Chippendales so yeah oh real vegas show.
Like it's not a joke.
Yeah well anyway we could talk a whole.
Lot more but we've hit about the hour.
Mark which means we don't have time for.
Twitter questions we all let's just do.
Some rapid fire.
I guess one no no just go through it.
Real quick no with the one we'll do one.
And we're gonna pull it from the reddit.
Page and we're gonna i guess we're gonna.
Open it up now i don't really i have it.
We're gonna start utilizing it things.
Using shows but what is like do you.
Watch the old videos still because i.
Know sometimes you guys do you cringe at.
It which one is your favorite one and i.
Want to go in order of greg will and in.
Ryan honestly i will say something quick.
About this oh that's the one thing.
That's crazy about like i feel like the.
Work that i've done with ryan is a lot.
Of time if i watch old videos i don't.
Cringe if it was like something i made.
Like a long time ago for sure i would.
Cringe at it but that's why it's like i.
Know it's not being really special.
Because i don't know i said they hold up.
Yeah they really do there's some videos.
That i cringe i do add a lot of them.
Some people are better than obviously.
Some bears but so which ones are your.
Favorites then.
Stole it the good one oh my god.
Everybody okay we got to say this.
Because people for whatever reason the.
Ones we love right especially for me and.
Greg when we're editing we're like dying.
Sometimes and we're like oh no we're.
Laughing so hard no one's gonna like.
This never all the ones we love like so.
Many of them i know even the ones that.
I'm like oh this is so bad and we're.
Like that means it's gonna do good you.
Know and for whatever reason being greg.
And that final edit if we're dying we're.
Like great no one's gonna get this.
There's literally like videos that you.
Guys probably don't know exist that.
They're my favorite videos just because.
They're so deep yep but i would say my.
Favorite video would probably be man we.
Meet some man there was 100 was the.
Scary one we did with kyle all the.
Paranormal writers yeah that's not my.
Favorite as far as something i was the.
Most proud of i mean it was probably.
Yeah it would probably have to be like.
One of the big videos i meant like candy.
Crush that was like a really that was.
The one i was gonna say that was like a.
Transitional video for us i think were.
You yeah that's when i was like holy.
Crap you just created a world.
Yeah and like we never did anything like.
That and i was like if you can do this.
And then and then that was your downfall.
Cuz i'm like great can do this that.
Means you can do all these other things.
And then yeah it just spiraled from.
There yeah i was gonna say candy crush.
Actually god that was the person i was.
Like yeah super cool.
But then that's another one we go back i.
Don't cringe but i'm like oh this is.
Compared to some of the stuff he's doing.
Now in terms of the effects i'm like oh.
This is nothing now right but i mean.
Still it's not nothing.
Yeah you know even even if you just like.
Put it during that time where you know.
Effects we're still pretty new for.
Youtube videos yeah it's not anything.
Good but it was decent for the time for.
Us it was good yeah yeah there was like.
I think at the time freddie wong was.
Doing crazier stuff and was like well.
That's his gimmick you know our gimmick.
Is not even about effects just supposed.
To enhance the comedy corridor has.
Always been some they were wrong before.
Freddie right yeah i mean they're low.
They were working with yeah yeah yeah.
And they've always been like killing the.
Game yeah some like some youtube channel.
That i always looked up to.
Can i machine-gun knees no we're out of.
Time what was your first job um gift.
Wrapper at the mall they strap gifts.
Nice time no let's just go quick ones.
Quick ones how did you meet dana awesome.
Dance class when's the next episode of.
Willing greg show mm and then i think.
One last thing that i wanted to say is.
We're out of time sorry i know we're out.
Of time no i'm just getting go ahead but.
Uh because the reason why i chose the.
Question of what was your guys favorite.
Old videos is that because you recently.
Announced that you were dating arden i.
Just didn't watch this if you know it i.
Thought it would be kind of cool to see.
Both you and arden react to agents of.
Secret stuff is just you pitch an idea.
Well we had previously talked about this.
But i just i don't think it's a i don't.
Want to i know you don't.
Yeah that actually is one i would cringe.
At i cringe at agent secret stuff anyway.
I'm like yeah he says oh if he skits.
It's one of those videos oh it gets so.
Many legs you guys would do it but i.
Really don't want to so i'm gonna say.
Like i don't even know what our podcast.
Gets normally but double it triple it it.
Has to be in the first week cause you.
Can't keep adding up eventually look at.
Yesterday's one how about that i hate.
Asking for likes though you don't have.
To like it if you don't like it we'll do.
It should i do that's really you know.
Almost difficult like a hundred thousand.
Okay well yeah i like a lot for a.
Podcast that's pretty unrealistic.
Drop it down a little bit all right.
50,000 no 100 hundred six thousand the.
Gregg special fine second channel though.
Yeah yeah yeah well i i don't want to do.
It and now i feel like it's gonna happen.
I don't watch that thing again you guys.
Heard the deal 69 thousand likes ryan.
Does a reaction to a snow arden does it.
And un arden see six hundred ninety.
Thousand likes and we watch sean and.
Ryan's been sleeping that part out don't.
Even mention this alright we need to end.
This thank you guys for watching the.
Hook the bill podcast i mean you guys.
Know how we ended so in three two one.
Ian oh my gosh that is even deeper why.
Dude that's deep it all that's not see.
You next time.
