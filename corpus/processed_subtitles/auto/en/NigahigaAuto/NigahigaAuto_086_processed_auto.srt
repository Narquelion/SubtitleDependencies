Hey guys so it just passed that i cannot.
Open notice this very overused trend.
That's all i saw about wednesday.
Seriously can get it it's funny when.
It's a joke but they were seriously a.
Lot of people who really think that.
They're forever alone i don't what is.
This.
And these people are actually sat there.
Same and i don't think that's a.
Legitimate reason to be sad no one needs.
A wiper in our girlfriend to be happy.
And just a heads up by telling people.
Only you are you're actually repetitive.
Everything that you want self-pity is.
Not attractive to most people just smile.
Be happy maybe your next valentine's day.
It could look like mine yeah i know.
You're turned on right now you're a.
Little cold but you're gonna be heating.
Up because i'm gonna be on you all night.
You ready cuz together we're gonna.
Create something beautiful you think i'm.
Making a joke but that's pretty much how.
My valentine's night was i even tweeted.
It twitter blasts anyway i am sick of.
This trend and i want no part of it no.
Part of it nope you already know i'm.
Gonna do it so.
I don't know how to say this but i i.
Love you thank you.
Applause.
Hey honey did you miss us all here you.
Go 20 bucks.
Thanks for appreciating it hey make sure.
You pay me back though.
You wanna boom you want a boo you want.
The bull you want the boat no forever no.
Boom one day i'm gonna be a tree yeah.
Probably not forever a stone.
Music.
Oh yeah just keep lying down freaking.
Camper forever intro who are you forever.
Alone.
Mom dad bus where are you guys.
It may not mean nothing to y'all forever.
Bye drink um yeah so i have adhd as you.
Probably can see for every butterfly.
My point is that yes we all want to find.
That one person that we fall in love.
With and i really do have nothing.
Against the forever alone - i'm just.
Saying if you're actually sad about.
Being single don't go posting it all.
Over the internet for everybody to see.
That's not gonna work and if you're in.
Your teen years and younger i know a.
Boyfriend or girlfriend might seem like.
The most important thing in the world.
Right now but trust me it's not i'm 21.
I've been a teenager for like ten years.
I know so stop worrying about being.
Alone just smile at it like - in school.
There's a lot more fish in the sea.
And remember the world is your oyster.
And one day you're gonna find your pearl.
Unless if your oyster has no pearl then.
In that case you would have to get.
Another waster which means you need.
Another world yeah it's not looking good.
For you.
