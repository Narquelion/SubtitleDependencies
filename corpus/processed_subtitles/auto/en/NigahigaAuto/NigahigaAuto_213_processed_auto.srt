Holy crap they're gonna pay me this much.
Money just to make a video and i just.
Completely sold out yeah yeah and oh i.
Support gay marriage or saying like just.
Saying that you're gonna get heat either.
Way yeah yeah so you might as well just.
Make both sides hate you and say you.
Don't and you do accept that people hate.
Them love them bring on the hate all.
Right we we're all good you roll every.
Cameras good are we doing the claps.
Claps we only need why why dude it's so.
Loud in our headsets come on.
Is that our intro the clap claps that's.
The clap claps we got the clap claps we.
Got beeps well we but we need the clap.
Claps to sync if people don't know it's.
Not we're not just applauding ourselves.
Yeah it's to sync up the audio with the.
Video yeah anyway welcome to the first.
Off the pill podcast it's not the it's.
Not the first one i'm a liar it's not.
The first one we've done we've done -.
Actually we've done three i posted two.
On the second channel one was with just.
Us i think and then we did one with.
David david choi a lot of you guys.
Really liked it but we stopped doing it.
For a very long time oh yeah i'm sorry.
There's a third one that we did with.
Derek but i don't was unsalvageable.
It's derek you know we went a little.
Off-topic it was almost like i don't.
Know what to do with this video we've.
Been experimenting yeah we've just been.
Experimenting you know yet inside the.
Mind of ryan higa yep that podcast was.
Basically inside the mind of derek it.
Well it was but i also felt like he was.
Trying to channel someone else's mind.
One day we might i might just post it.
One day just because it'll be funny sure.
But i feel like we should not be posed.
In that kind of pocket yeah it's a long.
Format yeah no we're getting used to it.
Anyway we are figuring it out and this.
Is the first one it's not i already said.
This is technically the first one on.
This channel yeah but it's not the first.
One how did i how did how do we we don't.
Even have an intro nope.
Anyway i think we should stick with the.
Clapping thing i mean we already did it.
Oh okay off to a good start.
I guess you can just say i just want to.
Give that intro because this is the.
First one so you want to intro the.
Guests so the guests i guess i don't.
Know if you guys are always gonna be.
Here we're still figuring out we got to.
Get i think we already have a bunch of.
Guests that we have coming up i don't.
Know if it's smart to say who it is yet.
But um you guys already know paco you.
Guys already know will and you guys.
Might know me yeah okay well and also.
For people who don't know it's called.
Off the pill podcast if you don't know.
That by now which is a little strange.
While you're watching this it's because.
That whole thing started when i started.
Ranting on videos without taking my meds.
I have adhd i don't take my meds.
Sometimes and when i do that i start.
Talking in circles and talking about.
Random things and that's what this.
Podcast is all about you know just.
Having fun talking about random things.
Really is an important and important.
Issues unstructured no they're.
Structured bar faris structure what are.
You talking about i mean there is.
Structure within unstructured we all.
Clapped boom every single time in the.
Beginning we always clap that structure.
And we breathe in.
That's our closer yeah we're not we're.
Still figuring this we have two things.
Basically that are structured everything.
In the middle okay.
Well it's only our first one technically.
Fourth one because we're not posting the.
Derg one yeah we're not talking about.
Anything by the way let's get into it.
What do we have on the agenda okay we.
Have so many things to cover because.
We've never covered anything yep well.
Why don't we talk about something that's.
You know kind of hot right now.
Ooh it's a skinning uh what do you wait.
What you trying to you made that gate.
Sound dirty so no i just meant a hot.
Topic oh you want talk about hot topics.
It's very when i was a kid i was.
Actually scared of hot meat see my mom.
Wouldn't let me go in there.
Ya know honestly i know really not.
Scared but i i couldn't know i was i was.
Scared yeah it definitely was fright.
Frightening for unless if we get.
Sponsored by a hot topic yeah speaking.
Of which let's thank our sponsors for.
Today hot topic that's not true i don't.
Know if that's even legal for me to say.
That we're not swat not topic is not.
Sponsoring this.
We have no sponsors we have no money but.
If you'd like to sponsor this podcast.
You could reach this email right here.
Your commercial could be just like this.
Have you ever wanted to go and get.
Something that's kind of scary to kids.
But also really cool to some kids that.
Are outcasts.
Does that sound bad well then go to.
Topics are us hot topics this that could.
Be you this is the essence of off the.
Pill podcast we tried to start something.
I know and we absolutely failed and went.
Somewhere else with it.
People don't know this to it people.
Don't know this too but we've actually.
Done more that that we never people.
Would never see because we were just.
Experimenting and they're just trash.
Kind of like this one back to paco.
While we talk a little bit about brand.
Deals cuz that seems to be something.
That a lot of everyone has yeah yeah are.
Going into it i know except uh you've.
Kind of been someone that has steered.
Away from that type of content and my i.
Personally i'm very interested in that.
You told we've talked a little bit about.
It but i think a lot of the audience do.
Would be like how does ryan make money.
On youtube since the ad pocalypse you.
Know i mean it's not as good and i.
Haven't i really don't do that many.
Sponsorship deals because i always base.
The content around i mean you guys know.
I've always based it around just if the.
Ad interferes with the funny or the.
Story then i'm not gonna do it i get i.
Get asked to do stuff like probably.
Every day like multiple inquiries.
Alright reflex but okay.
Is that a flex it is that's what.
Continue continue continue i don't know.
What that means i know you're we're.
Gonna go adhd right now continue on the.
Band you're the one who threw me off i.
Didn't take my fault what are you.
Talking about you're talking about.
Brownie like some people ask you.
Everyday.
Oh okay yeah people send or that is a.
Flex it is it's not that weird though.
It's normal for youtubers anyway as i.
Was saying before someone interrupted my.
Flight ever i was talking about yeah we.
Get that all the time.
I get that sent in random enquiries and.
Most i would say like ninety-nine out of.
A hundred are things that i don't really.
Care for don't really know or i.
Find a way to make it funny or it's just.
A ridiculous off like it's like nothing.
Or they just want like sometimes it's.
Just like hey you mind making a video.
For us we don't have any money but you.
Know this i think we think this you'll.
Like this product like well i mean if i.
Really liked it i would use it but that.
It felt like i said it comes down to.
Like can you make it interesting.
Mm-hmm that's how i choose sponsored it.
This that's why there's almost none yeah.
And yeah it would be nice to have some.
It would be it would we could upgrade.
Our mics not if you sound horrible right.
They're actually pretty good and rolled.
Shout the road this is not a sponsorship.
But they did send this free free stuff.
So that's why we have this set up yeah.
So thank you very much road yeah not a.
Sponsorship nope because it's still.
Waiting for you one thing too that i've.
Noticed like brands and will try to.
Reach out to you the process is very.
Slow.
You know yeah and the way that ryan.
Works is is within like a week.
He thinks of idea we film it and edit it.
And if if that holds back like the brand.
Or the deal holds it back in any way.
It's very hard to commit to it you know.
Cuz it's like what is it it's time it's.
A balance between like you know doing.
Our own thing and the time that is.
Involved right with working with them.
And going through that process.
It's a long process it's really long and.
Yeah i've also worked with other.
Youtubers as well and cool.
Well wasabi and when they were doing.
Brand deals and stuff a lot of times.
Yeah those brands would see a completed.
Project and they'd be like we don't like.
This right we want something else that's.
Also a big thing that i always try and i.
Wouldn't say negotiate but that's like a.
Must i always have to say like i want.
The creative control and a lot of times.
Brands don't want to give you that yeah.
Cuz they want to make sure their brand.
If they're paying for it they want to.
Make sure like it's all about them yeah.
Exactly.
So that's why for me it's just every all.
These things have to line up for me to.
Be able to do it but in a podcast way.
Easier form this way easier yeah just.
Talk about it but even with that i would.
Still want products that i actually like.
I don't want to be like i don't want to.
Name any.
I don't want to like talk about x.
Product and that product i don't even.
Like yeah you know like oh that's a.
Crappy thing cuz i like this other one.
Better but because they're paying me i'm.
Gonna talk like because it's like you're.
Signing off on it you're like it.
Sourcing it in a way exactly and you're.
And then it people use it or buy it and.
It's bad it's just like your opinion.
Means nothing yeah if it's a bad product.
But you have the luxury of doing that as.
Well what do you mean where you're in a.
Comfortable space yeah it's yeah i mean.
It so it would be it's comfortable.
Spaces that is a debatable at the answer.
Yeah yeah yeah who you're talking about.
Because i think overall you're in a lot.
More of a comfortable spot than most.
People of course yeah yeah than most.
People so you're you have the ability to.
Make those decisions and not be like oh.
I'll give up a little bit of my morals.
Or values to do this sponsorship yes.
Yeah i would say so.
Yeah but i mean i've done things that.
I'm not proud of who she would go into.
That i'm not proud of maybe like what is.
If you want to talk about what's the.
Most positive experiences with brands or.
Ones that you've kind of look back on.
And said like that was good and you know.
It's fun and i mean there's the thing is.
It's tough because i don't know which.
Ones i've signed contracts with that i.
Can't talk about there's just a part of.
That how about let's talk about the.
Positive in like which one did you enjoy.
The most.
I don't know there's a lot of them you.
Know what a good examples like the.
Fortnight video right i had the idea and.
I went to them actually they didn't come.
To me i was like hey i have this idea do.
You have some kind of budget so i can.
Make this you know better yeah and i.
Went to epic games yeah yeah epic games.
Well i kind of met like a middle person.
But we made that deal happen and that.
Was it's easier that way because i can.
Present them my idea rather than being.
Like hey you have to say our name this.
Many times you got to show this much.
Gameplay and like that's that's the kind.
Of stuff that's i could turn off to me.
Right but i mean i i had yeah i've had.
Some bad experience it when i'm not bad.
It's just like i've had ones in the past.
When i started like.
In high school yeah i did my first brand.
Deals i was just like holy crap they're.
Gonna pay me this much money just to.
Make a video and i just completely sold.
Out yeah yeah and people were pissed.
Back then people kids way different.
Hated ads you know like how i never.
Understood that you know how like back.
Then i don't know if they'd still have.
Hints but when like skateboarders you.
Liked got sponsored you big holy crap.
He's legit like that's dope congrats.
That's awesome right back when youtube.
First was starting if you got a.
Sponsorship of any kind people were.
Pissed at you like i don't know if you.
Guys remember that time i was like mm.
Between 5 and i guess 9 and 10 right i.
Remember we all did this carl's jr. deal.
I remember the mater made our own.
Mushroom basically what about portobello.
Mushroom burger yeah we did this ad.
All of us did one in our own way and we.
All had to post at the same time and i.
Thought it was funny i mean i was having.
Fun with it everybody seemed like they.
Were doing their own versions but people.
Were like pissed they were so mad.
Oh you guys are sellouts and all this.
Stuff i was like yeah okay it was a lot.
Of money but i think at the same time.
It's because this is at the time there's.
A new platform it was like wow these.
Guys have so much like creative control.
And like they're doing what they want to.
Do that's great and then to see i guess.
A corporate that's come in there it's.
It's change its new to it yeah you're.
Just a little too close to mike that.
Time danny got scolded dude the first.
Scoring of the off the building was.
Gasps he's a loudest person most also.
Their closest i think that's even better.
Sounds more balanced we're talking about.
A corporate yeah yeah i see that.
Perspective but now it's crazy how it's.
Changed like honestly i even felt back.
Then i felt like for me i didn't do that.
Many after that and i kind of learned.
But like i wanted people if i was.
Working with a brand it had to be.
Somebody my followers would be like.
Happy about yeah holy crab you gots it.
Like like the nintendo and i just did.
Like i actually love i've always loved.
Intends and most people do.
I think they grew up like our age grew.
Up with nintendo games and stuff.
Like that i feel like that's something i.
Felt okay this is just cool i've always.
Wanted to work with them same with like.
I would work with i don't know just.
Things that people like or i guess our.
Age group i don't know if people are.
Still what i mean with phonetics over it.
Like how we were i think this is which.
Is popularity kind of like a lot of.
People are gravitating towards that now.
You're kind of far joe rogan says just.
Official rogan did say that he always is.
Like swish that is one of the reasons.
Why i like podcast i love joe rogan for.
Sure i think like was this along like me.
Two three years ago yeah it's not a long.
Time but a couple years ago i wrote an.
Email to his thing to his like media.
Email really didn't get a response what.
Did you say i was just like i was.
Actually pitching to him for to do this.
Other idea this was like back when the.
Drama stuff was starting to happen yeah.
This is before nobody really knows this.
But i even i hit up joe rogan and.
Julianne from jenna and julianne right.
Because i wanted to do a show that was.
Kind of based around fighting between.
These people these drama channel because.
I was so sick of all like the they were.
All like district there was no fights at.
The time yeah i was like damn imagine if.
We had all these people having drama and.
They just like really fought like we sit.
Up at ufc like celebrity deathmatch but.
Not death yeah you know and i had this.
Idea i sent a very basic version no not.
A pitch i just kind of said oh i think.
You'd be great for this i would love to.
Work with you i'm a fan of your podcast.
Like how you think like i think it's.
Brilliant.
And i sent that over in the email a.
Couple years ago i don't know when.
Exactly it was just before there was.
Actual fights and right like i would say.
It within half a year that first fight.
Was announced it was alright it's been.
Done great yeah the real question is did.
Julian respond julian did respond yeah.
He thought it was a good idea because.
Julian's all down he's down for he's.
Down for us to fight yeah i mean i said.
One guy would never do jujitsu it i mean.
I would do it but i wouldn't like he's.
Too big and.
Grab some sleeves with him what did that.
Mean yeah what is it it was just like a.
Term i made up totally grab sleeves head.
Twitch card i was like julian grab some.
Sleeves and he was like what a car like.
That grab their sleeves oh you big ears.
Yeah yeah oh what were you thinking of i.
Don't know like the sleeve like yes like.
Ufc nobody has sleeves yeah well it was.
A jujitsu joke yeah i mean that's the.
Collar yeah trying to grab sleeves.
That's the sleeve is over here like okay.
Well what are you grabbing then you grab.
Their sleeve you know that you're.
Talking about the collar no no you can.
Grab sleeves in jujitsu.
Yeah of course yeah dude let's grab.
Sleep stop trying to make that happen.
Cuz it's gonna happen.
All right let's try it's like keep those.
Move let's grab sleeves let's leave that.
Alone.
Alone so that was brands you get another.
Topic sorry it's just an interesting.
Thing we don't have to like abruptly.
Stopped it stop it.
You know what's another brand that i.
Don't know if i should say this as i.
Feeling it in trouble for it but i don't.
Care my podcast i can say whatever what.
Day you get them you know it upsets me a.
Little bit mines my ears grab someone's.
Sleeve i'm here and they are swedish.
Guess who is it pewdiepie no as i was.
Fishing you into that it is ikea so when.
I was in la i went to ikea i mean.
Obvious everybody knows the hype right.
Early ikea and i wasn't i think i'm one.
Of the very small majority the minority.
Not majority one of the minority i'm.
Part of a minority that is not a big fan.
Of ikea what and i've never been meaning.
I got all my stuff after the first time.
I bought all my stuff for la from ikea.
And had to build all of it the next like.
Two days after that i was like i'm never.
Going here again well that's if they.
Want to sponsor this part just kidding.
Nope because let me tell you why later.
Down the road not only was a lot of the.
Stuff you know breaking and some of that.
And that's probably my fault for how i'm.
Eating their product.
Are bad because they actually have great.
A lot of this stuff in here well not all.
Of it actually not this stuff but.
There's other in the other house yeah.
It's a lot of ikea products in there.
Even the bed that you took for me.
Remember yeah there was a lot of ikea.
Products and they work fine but um a lot.
Of them would break and i think it's.
Probably the way i built it yeah that's.
Exactly my point like i feel like ikea.
Is a grocery store for furniture hmm and.
Like i just want to go to the restaurant.
Got it you know that's a great analogy.
Right yeah i thought of all people yeah.
Yeah i went in there and i instantly saw.
The only things i really buy from ikea.
Or things like this this is from this i.
Think this little thing in the.
Background you see how it's like metal.
It's kind of like yeah this cabinet.
Looking thing yeah the cabinet like.
Anything like any other wood stuff or.
Like any of like that kind of stuff i.
Don't really buy coz it's just it's like.
Ryan say it's like kind of falls apart.
It's like kind of work too dom has had.
His for how many years well regardless.
Even if you build it right i'm sure a.
Lot of people do and it lasts for a long.
Time and maybe they just treat their.
Stuff better than i do but regardless i.
Just i just feel like if you're gonna.
Pay that much money you should they.
Should make it for you you shouldn't.
Like you don't go to a bakery and say.
Hey could i get some dough and some.
Sugar and and then oh i'm gonna have to.
Make this at home now it's been another.
Half a day no the reason why people go.
To ai kids it's actually cheaper yeah.
But how much cheaper like a significant.
Amount is it really it really is that's.
Where we differ is you don't like it.
Because you have to build it yeah i.
Don't like it is because it it's not.
Like i'd rather just spend more money.
For something that's like higher call.
Like that a craftsman major yeah this.
Money making barrel i'm like cheap those.
Much money's i could save well no but i.
Like so ione can compare this to another.
Store out here in vegas it's like a.
Local place and they made products that.
Look just as good as ikea stuff i think.
It called biggs something i don't know.
Yeah they made products just as good are.
On the same price range i would say i.
Remember comparing at the time when i.
Was first getting furniture.
They're very similar psyche if not.
Cheaper and those products are still.
Held together they're already made and.
They do free delivery yeah i knew that i.
Don't know if it seems pretty big you.
Know what it is bigs yeah yeah yeah like.
It's a big it's a big place big and it's.
Um good stuff man.
Yeah they deliver for free like people.
Come in to us put it where you want in.
Your house like what that that alone is.
Worth whatever more you got to pay to.
Ikea to me and you save yourself a day a.
Day you could be working and making.
Money which is actually why you're.
Actually losing money by buying products.
Like that man they're never gonna work.
With me huh well that's probably what.
Prove me wrong.
Yeah that's probably what that store.
Does to compete with a store like thank.
You because right because like that name.
Like bomb meatballs they're they do have.
Good food their meatballs they do have.
Good fear.
Dude this sounds weird but i think ike.
Is like a dope like second date yeah.
That's not weird people already do that.
Yeah people should have dates there the.
Wall okay this is something that grabs.
My sleeves what's what's going on right.
Now grab sleeve dude no i done already.
Is been done i just hate when other.
People go to ikea now and they're.
Filming pun video oh my dude daddy's.
Realiza do that and his wife she's like.
One of the first people oh she did the.
Market one right and then someone did.
Like the ikea names cuz they're so weird.
Well i have no idea who did but if.
You're doing it now still oh just.
Weren't still do we know people are wait.
Didn't he do that no i didn't okay i.
Think you guys did know i definitely.
Kind of stuff if we went to ikea we'd be.
Doing that but we wouldn't be filming.
Yeah you don't because we'd also just be.
Trying to like make each other cringe.
Yeah which puck is great at but i'm a.
Class a yeah in charge i have like he's.
Been on a ledge down teeth oh yeah you.
Are on the pewdiepie buys dude that's.
How cringy you are i'm amazing dude dude.
That is awesome i'm killing it man i.
Want to make the pewdiepie any list you.
Wish you could not good enough man get.
On my cringe level.
Speaking i should probably get off the.
Topic of brands because what if burning.
Bridges just saying though i mean my.
Opinion could change i'm not gonna take.
The deal unless it has changed then.
Interesting transition from hey we don't.
Have any brands to you know topic one.
Really did scare me and ikea i honest i.
Still i'm not gonna lie right let's try.
How i feel.
Let's try and salvage is do it so hot.
Topic did scare you at first but but i.
Go there but now they're great because.
We go there for props we want to have.
Like a really like you know want to go.
For that look and i also think they have.
Like some good like real nice things.
Like like they tap into certain i guess.
Cultures band that's sure or they have.
Like that like searching like weepings.
Cartoons yeah happened to that and if i.
Want to wear like some dumb sailor moon.
Shirt which i love.
Should we tell people the fun fact that.
You like to wear skirts at home for.
Northerns.
Oh my i talk to wear skirts there's.
Nothing wrong with that dude this is.
2019 no it's not that it is i live with.
You yeah you know like wow what is your.
Mindset for that like i mean like i'm.
Not judging yeah it's the same with but.
I am a little bit it's the same with.
Crocs uh-huh i was like do nobody wears.
This so it's just you want your hipster.
So i just want to like you know wait i.
Guess in a way hipster yeah but it's.
More like i wanna make people cringe do.
You want me to tell the story about what.
You're talkin can tell this story.
Because i think he's trying to defend.
Himself.
No so i woke up so this is we're living.
At the old house when you explained the.
Situation cuz you're living with paco.
I'm lived paco moved in he's he just.
Starting to work with us and i was like.
Okay we got a new guy park was pretty.
Cool you know and i walk out to go into.
The office and paco walks out of his.
Room with no shirt on no socks but he's.
Wearing a pink skirt i'm not talking.
About like a costume like a girl's skirt.
Yeah schoolgirls yeah he walks by me.
He's like hey what's up.
Like not trying to be funny not trying.
To make me laugh he just walks by and.
I'm looking at him like waiting for him.
To kind of turn around or like maybe.
He'd lift his skirt up to try and make.
Me laugh or like make a joke nothing he.
Could tell like he slept in it his eyes.
He goes i'm a boogers in it.
Just walk not in sleeping in 100% in it.
Sleep in it well he just it's almost.
Stranger because you made a conscious.
Choice to like hey i'm gonna go out into.
The into the world with no shirt on and.
Just a skirt which is i mean summertime.
So it's like really hot and i never.
Lived in vegas so i was like no shirt i.
Need that ventilation on my nips and if.
I'm wearing pants you know i have a.
Skirt i can just open it up and there's.
A breeze strumming we already know now.
That that's you yeah but like this is.
Like when you first oh yeah yeah i came.
Into the group and we were just like.
Okay so this guy is different not i mean.
It's not a bad thing it's interesting if.
Anything you know don't wear it anymore.
No i have been worn in for a long time.
See it's not genuine then you don't love.
Skirts.
That's why it's like i just wore it just.
To be like huh how we like react i think.
You are discovering yourself that's the.
Kind of person i feel like you are oh.
Yeah always self-discovery everyday you.
Know did you like check it off a list.
Like skirts cross i will wear it once in.
A while though for like streams or.
Something okay well that's just for.
Entertainment yeah it's funny the weird.
Thing about it was that you weren't.
Doing it for any like you just we.
Weren't filming you just did it it was.
Behind closed doors yeah that you walked.
Out of that closed door to me mm-hmm are.
You a fan of jaden smith i feel like.
That's something he did and like maybe.
That it was around that time maybe.
That's why it might have been but i know.
You're inspired by those so the thing is.
I had actually bought that two years.
Before mm-hmm.
And then from that point it was kind of.
Just like hey this is a weird thing to.
Have so i'm just gonna use it sometimes.
Okay because like i mean otherwise it's.
Just sitting around yeah you can't let a.
Good skirt go to wait yeah you know.
Guess.
If you got it flaunt it yeah watch us.
Get all these comments like oh my god.
Will and ryan are so unaccepting i said.
You can wear whatever you want i know.
But this is my this is my pocket i think.
I think it's a little weird i mean i.
Have nothing against people who cross.
Dress that's fine.
And who says it's cross-dressing what if.
You were irish is that stereotypical.
Though there's kilts kilts scot scottish.
Scottish not irish when i first saw it.
That's what i thought it was i was like.
No it's like but it is pink yeah but i.
Mean they have pink kill today you walk.
By night and i was like oh that's a it's.
A skirt yeah yeah we're gonna get those.
Comments for sure well not for you.
You're gonna be like oh don't make fun.
Of paco he just like skirts let it be.
Who he is.
That's how i think their voices sound.
I'll see you in that comments we're.
About to get roasted me and will like so.
Close-minded clothes mind closed minded.
Bang i don't know that made me think.
About like i don't know why we started.
Talking about that hot topic oh that's.
Right his weird choices see even the.
Fact that i even have to quit like i.
Have to stop myself from saying that's a.
Weird choice that he made and think.
About like all the backlash.
Yeah like are people gonna it's such a.
Such a sad thing it was never like this.
Before we we talked about this all the.
Time never ought not publicly but yeah.
It's my think it's but it's not like.
It's not coming from a place of hate no.
Not at all it's just coming from a place.
Of like oh this is different to me yeah.
I'm the norm yeah like i mean i just i.
Mean like even like the whole yeah it's.
So frustrating to talk because i have to.
Be careful yeah yeah yeah there's all.
These like there's so many rules.
Landline there's so many rules but like.
Even like talking about like the like.
Saying like before it everything changes.
Saying like oh i support gay marriage or.
Saying like just saying that you're.
Gonna get hate either way yeah yeah so.
You might as well just make both sides.
Hate you and say you don't and you do.
Accept that gay people hate them love.
Them bring on the hate both sides i want.
Both.
Or you get love from both sides you know.
Are you going to be like i don't care.
Yeah you know whatever that is try it i.
Think the old sides will be like oh why.
Don't you care about our agenda i know.
This is like every like podcast has like.
Pc talk yeah yeah but you know what i.
Actually never did a video on i never.
Actually really did a video about gay.
People or like kind of like touched on.
That one that was like the hot topic.
Yeah hot topic that was your brands.
Nobody you know i mean it was like i.
Mean it was more popular than it is now.
Like everything happens in trends like.
For a while the whole game we're not.
That it's done but the whole move the.
Gay movement and lgbt thing yeah was.
Solely focused around gay marriage i.
Forget you remember okay sure.
And then now it's kind of like the.
Transgender thing you know but before it.
Was more just like you know about gay.
Marriage and you know gay people and.
Letting them be there and stuff yeah but.
It's funny how things happen in trends.
But when that was happening i just never.
Really touched the subject obviously had.
We had gay friends i don't again i was.
Kind of in that boat of like i don't.
Care yeah do what you want to do what.
Makes you happy baby yeah do what you.
Want to do like i also and if you it's.
Your religion and you are against it to.
Me i'm just like okay then be against it.
But i'll don't have to go in you and i.
Come from hawaii which is a place of.
Like people are just openly super.
Flamboyant if they are gay oh yeah well.
Like they're called marries in a way.
Indeed life for her memories for us.
Yeah just heard a different m word oh.
Yeah oh that one as well but in hawaii.
They say ma hoo yeah but i don't know if.
That's insulting.
Yeah i don't know either.
Honestly anymore i don't know.
Everything's changed man but you know.
What i always thought the way i really.
Broke it down and tried to think about.
It is like i can't like i really believe.
That you can't choose to be gay so how.
Can you hate on someone exactly yeah for.
Something they can't control mmm you.
Know it's like hating on someone like.
Being asian yeah but people would really.
Do believe that you can choose to be gay.
Yeah like a lot of people still believe.
That less but i think a lot of people do.
And it's a choice but the funny thing is.
I think the people who think like.
That are actually the closest to.
Becoming gay or being gay or they are.
Gay and they're trying to fight it this.
Yeah like the only people who are like.
If you really think about it like i try.
And think it think about it myself like.
If it's a choice i can't really right.
Now think or i think i just can't be.
Attracted to both of you.
I can't choose to want to be attracted.
To you guys that hurt you know i mean.
Like i can't or any guy yeah i can't.
Choose if you really think it's possible.
Right now if i were to think like you.
Know what it's if if it was my choice if.
I wanted to do that yeah i could be gay.
And i could like you i could be.
Attracted to you then i'm probably gay.
Mehar by turing but i don't think it's.
Possible to be to choose it like i just.
Really can't think it's possible i think.
You think it's a choice then you're.
Probably questioning yourself yeah i.
Thought about it before like am i gay i.
Know.
And then i we thought you were yeah.
Actually a lot of people think i am it's.
Well the skirt thing and like you know.
There's a bunch of others yeah but and.
I'm like very i can be very flamboyant.
At times yes but then i was i was just.
Like hmm okay like i can see guys and be.
Like oh dude that's an attractive person.
But i'm not i mean anything yeah exactly.
And for me i don't know this is gonna.
Get taken out or inappropriate but when.
I brush my teeth.
Not taking out anything dude and i scrub.
The back of my tongue and i gag i'm like.
I don't like this feeling enough me and.
We might have to take it out like hot.
Topic and i care never gonna appear this.
Video when they sponsor this well that's.
What you're saying about like you don't.
Think it's a choice to be homosexual i.
Don't think it can be from the high.
Point of view imagine like growing up.
Because from our point of view as a.
Straight male yeah we we grew up and we.
Were born into this world and we like.
We're attracted to women right so.
Imagine being like born a man and just.
Being born attracted to men and having.
People say right you know it's got to be.
Pretty frustrating oh yeah definitely.
Looking at it from their point of view.
Is like so and if someone told you like.
It's a choice for you to like women it's.
Like well let's just true i'm attracted.
To it's so very easy but that's what i'm.
Saying the people who are even.
Questioned like if they even think that.
It's a choice yeah it means they can't.
They're probably thinking about it for.
Themselves sure cuz like or they're not.
Thinking they're just saying like but.
Anyone who really thinks is a choice.
Just ask yourself this would you be able.
To choose to be attracted to a guy or.
Girl yeah if you're a guy would you be.
Choose to be attracted to these same sex.
Because if you if you can then you.
Really shouldn't be art making that.
Argument because you're probably gay.
Damn here's some freaking hot tea for.
You what does that mean if imagine them.
Saying that that it's a choice because.
They are homosexual and they chose to.
Like women boom oh explosion you know.
I'm saying so they're like it's a choice.
Yeah yeah damn give me a high-five.
Yourself to him dude grabbing your own.
Sleeves that's pretty sweet how do we.
Get on this topic i need to go down the.
Pc route oh you know what that's exactly.
Well we can't talk about current times.
And it's really upsetting i think you.
Know what i don't think it's bad to talk.
About it.
No yeah and i think honestly the times.
Are changing right now how you know.
Everything has become very pc over the.
Past like five years i would say sure i.
Mean not just in the past five but.
Really pc in the past five years old yes.
Yeah i think like i said everything.
Happens in trends and this trend is was.
Is at its peak and it's gonna change and.
Go the opposite direction i think.
There's gonna be a big movement of.
Anti-peace enos i think it's already.
Starting to happen and i think it's.
Gonna become almost like damn you know.
We're gonna be like okay maybe we need a.
Little bit more yeah again so i think.
It's gonna go and type in c and we're.
Gonna be just a bunch of like racists.
And meanies yeah but it's gonna be.
Acceptable and then it's gonna be.
Through the same thing i really believe.
That's how everything works well one.
Extreme pushes back the other extreme.
Exactly yeah then and it's always nice.
To find the balance but there's never.
Gonna be balance.
Just like there's never peace there will.
Be balance if more people are balanced.
Boom.
That is as not that's it okay that's.
I'll work on it yeah yeah but that's.
Right that's what this kind of sucks.
About the world is like it's it really.
Is kind of through the lens of the.
Extremes when i think moult like i i.
Would say the majority of people are.
More more of like in the middle yeah but.
It's that like that like loud minority.
Yeah you know which is kind of a shame.
Mm-hmm well i mean there goes our that's.
And that's our pc section of the week.
Peace enos that's gonna be like our.
Little penis.
For this episode of the penis of the.
Week we talk about gay you can't choose.
To be gay if you believe that you're.
Probably gay all right we're gonna have.
A piece enos of the week thing i might.
Bring it back see what people like you.
Know we're still experimenting i like it.
Um what else we got on the agenda today.
I like it i don't think you meant to say.
It but say what bearer menteng you know.
Like people who are curious about it.
It's the about what you know like if.
They're about the penises yeah yeah i.
Mean i mean like you know i didn't mean.
To say that but okay.
It's just naturally in you to experiment.
Is um she's she break i kind of do but.
Like so we were talking about having.
This thing in our podcast where we do uh.
You know rather than just doing the add.
Section what if we had what if we had.
Like this you know how normally they do.
Mid maybe rose-red a boat instead we do.
I mean some people do like sponsorship.
Stuff but what if we created our own.
Commercials yeah see this could be you.
Hot topic or you ikea carl's jr. again.
So we feel actually worked with in there.
Great no that's why again yeah film our.
Own commercial that we run during our.
Sheshe breaks i think we could make it.
But we make it funny that would be.
Pretty cool i don't think you know.
That's a lot of work too that's like.
Making a whole another video yeah i mean.
Oh buddy i mean we could do it super.
Simple though yeah like like a 20 second.
Thing take a quick sheshe break yeah.
People don't know from hawaii we call.
Peeing shishi number one is shishi.
Number two is do do i guess that same.
Thing for everyone well i guess if we.
Take a doodoo break that's if there's a.
Long ad we do like a minute and a half.
Add one of those ones where the sidebar.
Comes up it's like skip ad dude - dude.
That's what you can never take a do to.
Break at a that much taco no need to.
Spence no we're bringing it up because.
This is how paco avoids work when we're.
Filming and shoots paco will go missing.
For a clean 45 minutes and we already.
Know where he is he's in the bathroom.
Pooping yeah do doing i have a really.
Tight butthole i don't think that's the.
Reason i think it's just because you're.
On your phone that's okay so a new game.
Came out what uh so supercell who has.
Created yes clash royale classic line.
Right right about with sprawl stars.
Right like a moba game but i mean it.
Just got released in america because.
Apparently it's been played in other.
Countries so what you're saying is the.
Next time you go to the bathroom i'm.
Definitely playing longer break yeah so.
You're just saying you're not working no.
I am well everyone else is like we're.
Sweat we're try and get things done i'm.
Writing because i'm thinking on you know.
Second channel ideas oh yeah because.
You're playing girl stuff maybe we could.
Get a brand deal with brawl stars and.
Then they'll give me your phone is.
Probably so filled of poop no cuz it's a.
Brand new phone i bet you one sitting.
Food particles yeah there's so many poop.
Articles but i do like having a shisha.
Because i actually been drinking a lot.
Of caffeine yeah should we do a quick.
Shishi break and come back mini break.
Two-minute break.
And oh wait not claps she break b and.
We're back to be off the bill podcast.
Starring me me and me we didn't plan.
That it just happened and i hate it and.
I hate it so much.
Anyway maybe it's a bad idea to do these.
She she breaks cuz like i forget what we.
Were talking about well that's why you.
Know what it's a refresher because i.
Don't remember what we were talking.
About i show took my meds what if half.
The video is off the pill podcast and.
The other and happy and i'm just like.
Really focused i think we should just.
Like just start like guys actually have.
Work to do.
Just talking on your own honesty when i.
Do take my my adderall yeah i man.
Adderall such a bad name i guess like.
Now it's like such a bad rap yep but i.
Think people get affected from it.
Differently yeah yeah like for me when i.
Take it i don't get like height.
I'll some other people do mm-hm almost.
The opposite and i don't know if that's.
Normal.
But if i had it right now you guys could.
Be talking and i could be working on.
Something i could honestly work why you.
Guys are talking isn't listening isn't.
That amazing.
It's amazing for me because i get.
Distracted super easily yeah not like in.
The stereotypical like oh a butterfly.
You know yeah yeah but like even just.
Talking right now i'm thinking of other.
Things like what things i don't know.
Just like you've been talking about.
Words the word talking mm-hmm and then i.
Started thinking about like and i say.
That we're talking a lot i was thinking.
About that while i was explaining to you.
The other thing damn that's weird it's.
Not weird it's normal.
I think a lot of people do that they.
Just don't let themselves explore that.
Part yeah because even when i take my.
Meds that happens but i can control it.
That's the difference for me yeah and.
You know when i'm writing like scripts.
And stuff like that it's actually easier.
To not take it yeah and then after that.
But when i'm not taking it basically.
What happens is i write all this.
Nonsense like because the the reason why.
It turns out to be nonsense is because.
You're literally just going with the.
Flow and you can't stop because if you.
Stop you're gonna forget the great idea.
You had and but the great idea sometimes.
Leads to other ideas yeah that are.
Completely unrelated but you have to.
Write it down yeah.
Because you never know when it's gonna.
Come back yeah yeah and then you take.
Your meds the next couple days later and.
You go and fix all the little things.
Damn or put it together or put it put it.
In to make it make sense.
That's the secret right there that is.
The old not a secret do it if you have.
Adhd do that.
I heard it's different for it i've.
Talked to other people because they are.
Mean even like like comments and people.
Writing to me yeah saying like their.
Experiences are similar some are very.
Very different yeah i think it's not out.
Just like you have it or you don't think.
I think it's a scale no yeah and i.
Really get upset when people say like oh.
You're it's just like kids i mean a lot.
Of it is that kids who just want to do.
Drugs.
Sure um but it's not fun to me like.
Adderall is not a fun thing i don't get.
That same like hyperness and like yeah.
You know i mean it will keep you up but.
I don't get that like i don't get how.
That's fun yeah you know i don't know.
Well that's probably because you or.
Should be taking it to some extent.
Rather than i don't take it all the time.
Though yeah but yeah it's not fun to me.
At least no thank you way how do we get.
On that topic see i should took my meds.
We didn't even start with the topic know.
What's on the agenda.
Yeah well for transitioning into.
Different things.
Speaking of transitions yeah uh we can.
Just you know just talk about anything.
Cuz we we had something trending so why.
Don't we discuss something that you know.
Is bothering you guys recently in the.
Past couple of days yeah let's get.
Personal because i mean things that this.
Is something that i learned in a writing.
Class and what helps you write is name.
Three things that you really like right.
Now and three things that you don't like.
Right now and then that's what they told.
You in the class yeah well because.
That's how you start writing with the.
Topic right are you talking about fur.
Stand up.
No just in general oh in general like.
What worth writing stand-up or a joke or.
Making a video or a story then you just.
Like right through things so you could.
Be like i like food i like getting.
Massages and i like when people say.
Thank you when i open the door something.
I don't like static electricity i don't.
Like when i pick my nose too hard and i.
Bleed i love that one do you always.
Bring that up i do though you always use.
It as an example for something it's like.
We're playing like i dare you and you're.
Like oh why don't we doing weird like.
You pick your nose who can like pick.
Your nose until it bleeds no i brought.
This up many times this is not the first.
Time this is like the third time any.
I've heard it from you before maybe or.
Why either no it's - it's been at least.
A couple times we're like why do you.
Always go to that i don't like why do.
You want to see someone pick their nose.
Who they bleed know is that your fetish.
No.
Are you condemning my kings i i just i'm.
Curious is that your phone it's not as.
We can make that happen but you can pick.
Our noses till it bleeds but basically.
From the six different topics there's.
Usually like one or two that you really.
Are like oh this is something that.
Really annoys me or something i really.
Like and then that's the one that you go.
Off on already write about things i hate.
Yeah so i mean i guess in the past.
Couple of days what is something that.
You really like something has really.
Been bothering you.
Hmm something that's been really.
Bothering you static electricity i don't.
Know why but even know why it happened.
Know every time i put my clothes in the.
Dryer yeah cuz it's dry no but it's just.
Like it's there's so much build-up it.
Doesn't matter if i put like one of.
Those a dryer sheets the dryer sheets do.
Your laundry oh you didn't know what.
That was called huh i thought was a.
Detergent sheet or something like that.
Was called yes i mean i never had to use.
That in hawaii that's true yeah and so.
Now out here like i have to use it.
Inside used to using hawaii well even at.
The old house the cloth like i never had.
To use it and my clothes weren't.
Staticky uh and so it's so frustrating.
Cuz that is if i have a staticky shirt.
If i put it on and i start driving then.
It makes my my seat all staticky hmm and.
Then when i step out of the car gets.
Shocked every time it's it's happening.
So much maybe you have powers wasn't.
There a guy called static shock he's a.
Black dude why does that matter huh i.
Thought you don't see clothes oh okay.
Now i might have been a different day.
But yeah i maybe you just have like some.
Kind of gift i don't know i don't think.
That's that's a curse maybe there's some.
Way you can use it if you can channel.
Static more than the average person what.
Is the thing about it like this what is.
The ultimate lame superpower that you.
Can think of for yourself.
That's like wow that's you know i mean.
Like someone who can like remember that.
Family guy episode where like make could.
Grow her nail is really long that one's.
Pretty lame yeah but like something like.
That like what would be your let's try.
Think uh i don't know why i had this had.
This discussion with someone else before.
I was like if you had a realistic par.
With having to do with you but like not.
Unreal i cursed rength or something like.
That.
Okay a realistic lay empowerment.
Yeah i don't know why for some reason.
For me is just like you could hold your.
Breath for a really long time that's not.
Lame that's a cool one that's i mean it.
Is a little lame in that it's like well.
Would your name be you could swim like.
You're going to water for longer than.
Anyone in the world what are you gonna.
Do with it hide in the water that's true.
So what it's like.
Oh no they're robbing a bank mister hold.
Your breath forever man come save us.
Yeah but if they were like we designed.
These walking in the water boots and you.
Could walk under the water and sneak up.
On people boom you're a spy that's where.
Wheels mine wind.
You gotta get trained to go on land and.
Access a computer or something oh no you.
Gotta get trained yeah that was pretty.
Lame mind another lame power mine would.
Be related to me like growing my hair.
Instantly long that's lame but it's also.
Useful i could see how they could be.
Useful yeah it would just go yeah you.
Don't want to do like how great magic.
With tricks or something with that.
There's money and you know how great of.
A how great of a business that would be.
How many weeks you know what weeks cause.
You could help so many cancer patient.
That's true but you could also turn into.
A business that sponsors this podcast.
Brought to you by wheels by wigs wigs by.
Laughter.
Will or do people who are named will by.
The way just make sure you guys check.
Out was by wacom i'll be dead if that.
Has a this is the first time i said i'll.
Be dead if that is actually real say i'm.
Not i'm not even gonna be shocked if it.
Is but i'm gonna go buy it right now.
Yeah you should something if not someone.
Listen to this probably will do it how.
About you um man i so i had a forget who.
Was talking about with this but i had.
Some good ones by the way that use it it.
Might have been david but but our.
Premise was a little different it was.
Like how can you have a really lame.
Power but make it useful but it's also.
Like like it has to be like that bounds.
Of.
Yeah only reason why i brought it up i.
Was like it'd be really interesting to.
See that's what it was we're trying.
Thing about tweet cuz i want to see what.
Other people i never did it i don't see.
What other people would come up with.
Because there's so many but i forget how.
To list somewhere of a bunch of them but.
It sounds like a fun drinking game where.
Everyone has to like within 10 seconds.
Come up with like a lame superpower yeah.
And then everyone is kind of like no.
Butchers it would be cool because you.
Could do all this this is this and then.
Right the end whoever has like the best.
Lame superpower has to like drink or.
Something i got another lame one what.
You could get out you can instantly get.
Over a cold in 10 minutes so that power.
Is like like it's good but it's for a.
Superhero yeah it's pretty lame really.
Lame what if what if your power was to.
Just give someone a 10-second cold like.
You just feel like sick for 10 seconds.
That's it yeah they keep going the other.
Thing is like the the strength of the.
Cold is randomized from one to 10 yeah.
Sometimes it could be like flu for 10.
It's not that could be that bird no oh.
My god keto flu going through it right.
Now it's actually not as bad today as it.
Was the last couple of days yeah it.
Started about couple days ago so why are.
You going back into this though kido.
Yeah oh because it's um so yeah i mean.
It's a nice diet i like to dye it every.
Now and then remember this i mean.
There's the things i like having fun.
Doing good i i mean i i eat a lot and i.
Binge eat it's bad habits for all your.
Wrestlers out there peak you're gonna.
You're gonna get really fat or you have.
To learn how to control yourself because.
That's where i picked up all my eating.
Habits i learned binge eating i learned.
How to lose weight really quickly it's.
So unhealthy.
I've been told that but as a kid in high.
School i did not care because i just.
Wanted to win play worse i guess.
Fighters to stay champion in wrestling.
Yeah in judo i got second um but i had a.
Dislocated elbow while you were fighting.
In my first match i had a bye because i.
Was fourth seed and then i dislocated my.
Elbow they popped it back in or they did.
Something i don't know if they popped it.
Like wrapped it up it could barely use.
It the next match i had the it was.
Semifinals ready because i had to buy.
And i had to face this guy who was.
Actually the number one seed and he was.
Beating me the whole way i ended up.
Countering him and then pinning him on.
The ground because he wasn't a wrestler.
Hmm but he was like the favorite of the.
Whole so it was a big upset yeah and.
Nobody knew that i was like messed up.
And then i went to the finals match and.
Basically at that point after the last.
Guy it was like because it's all in one.
Day right so the first injury happened.
In the in the morning and then after.
Noon my arm is like i'm going to that.
Next one i got kind of lucky being the.
The best guy pretty much using one arm.
And the last guy who's even like the.
Guys before me were like oh man do not.
Lose to this guy we've all beat him.
Because there are there are 'allahu kids.
On the big island they were all like.
Dude do not lose to this kid because.
We've all beat like he shouldn't be.
There essentially what they were saying.
But i mean he earned i mean he got there.
Yeah you know he wasn't even seated in.
The top four out of like the 30 i don't.
Know how many people with 16 whatever it.
Is yeah anyway once i laid him i was.
Just like my arm was done like i.
Couldn't even like i could grab but it.
Was like the strength of like me no no.
It was feeling like a child like a.
Strength of a child so i basically had a.
Longer there so where it got worse and.
Worse and i didn't know that yeah yeah.
So i saw was really like upset because i.
Don't mind losing to someone who's.
Better i've always said this even like.
If it's like you know if i'm watching.
Basketball or any sport i don't mind.
When my team loses to like okay that.
Team would just deserve or when we play.
Basketball.
We play every wednesday and friday if we.
Lose to a team that's better than us and.
We get blown out i'm like cool with that.
But if we lose to a team by like one.
Point that we should have beat i'm like.
Really upset because it's like i don't.
Know why i just get really upset by that.
This is how you know it ryan as.
Frustrated went after the game usually.
Like he'll spend maybe two to three.
Minutes with the guys just talk and.
Actually let's tip spend a lot more time.
To adapt people up oh yeah if we did.
Really well he'll like hang out for like.
Maybe five minutes but if he's upset.
He'll grab his bags.
Alright hey guys peace peace yeah shake.
Everyone's hand just bounce but that's.
Only if we lose to a good team i don't.
It doesn't yeah we deserve like it.
Doesn't think we could have done yeah.
But in the same way in that in that.
Tournament i was i was very.
Disappointing because i knew i was like.
That was my senior year i was like what.
Could have been you know and i cut all.
This weight people don't realize how.
Hard that is to do in high school not.
Just in high school but i mean like well.
You know there's so many other things.
You got to worry about and you're like.
Always hungry and you're always grouchy.
Yeah.
And thirsty even so yeah that was a very.
Disappointing thing when you know i'm.
Not that i sit i'm gonna say i would.
Have won but like it you know you didn't.
Give it your all pretty much so we i.
Would say you probably did but it's just.
Things that were out of your control.
Right stopped you which is i mean i'm.
Sure everyone can relate to that it's.
Like super frustrating yeah i still.
Think you're number one thanks man.
Yeah but you're number two i am you know.
I'm actually numbered out of the number.
Two in doubles or tennis doubles so.
You're actually number four cuz your.
Other friend was also part of that okay.
Yeah i didn't know that you were.
Actually athletic until i saw you like.
Play basketball and you didn't know how.
To play basketball.
Yeah and you actually could play.
Basketball i said basketball like four.
Times okay talking talk now uh so yeah a.
Very similar situation where my partner.
Is way better than me i only started.
Playing tennis in uh in high school.
Where a lot of people have been playing.
It for like their whole lives and then.
My senior year my partner and i got.
Fourth seed and we were playing in the.
Semi-finals against the first seed and.
We beat them and it was just like it was.
A huge upset because these guys would.
Want like this song so because we had.
Beaten them everyone is like tripping.
Out of their eyes just like oh my gosh.
And like we're a public school too so to.
Beat a private punahou oh yeah it was a.
Explains the people who don't know.
That's where obama went yeah that's.
Wrong but if you're from hawaii sorry.
For all the punahou kids i think they.
Know this too yeah like everyone they're.
Like the best at everything yeah cuz.
They have like.
They have like the most pretty girls too.
I don't know about that but they have.
Like the most prestigious cues like the.
Smartest kids and like all the most.
Established it's like the top of the.
That's like let's take the harvard of.
Hawaii yeah the place everybody you know.
If you're not in there you're against.
Them yeah it's so it's a big deal he's.
There the patriot exactly they're the.
Warrior they're the yeah the warriors.
So when any other school in hawaii beats.
A punahou kid usually it's it's pretty.
Like you're like rooting for them yeah.
Non punahou person sorry for all the.
Underdog from point yeah but but it's.
True i mean that's it comes with the.
Territory being number one you i mean.
People always root for the underdog you.
Know and so we had beat their number one.
Seed the number one seed and i was.
Actually what dave shoji's son who dave.
Shoji the you age women's volleyball.
Coach the okay coach yeah right right.
Right.
Ah so we beat them and that night i was.
Like oh this is dope i got to height i.
Got to hike because then uh this girl.
I've never told this story.
Jordan lum if you're watching this i'm.
So sorry but the night before this girl.
Who is like watching like came up to me.
After it's like a good game you're.
Really cute you know what oh snap.
So when we are all supposed to go to.
Sleep i snuck out and hung out with her.
But so like early in the morning and.
Then went to my match and i was.
Exhausted and we we lost in straight.
Sets.
In the finals and i i was tired i do i.
Was tired and then if i was your.
Teammate but whoever that guy is you.
Need to apologize if that's once i don't.
Tell a lot of people it doesn't it.
Doesn't it's like who cares it's just.
States like it's just like a sport who.
Cares.
It's a big deal of dude like you'll.
Never get that chance again.
Yeah the same with like college players.
Like that's why i like a lot of times it.
Means more for them to win a.
Championship in college and doesn't an.
Nba in basketball because you'll never.
Get to do it again yeah you only get us.
X amount of chances for chances to be.
Protected.
Four chances and that's assuming you're.
At your best when your freshman.
Sophomore junior usually your senior.
Year dan that i feel bad for that guy.
It's big deal i mean you ever know two.
Events like that can lead to scholarship.
Three things that happen in your life.
You know and you took it away from your.
Teammates i mean should we have to have.
To blanket i don't think so.
He's actually a very dude ever since at.
A young age he's two years younger than.
Me but i was always just like how did.
You go to know he's three years younger.
If he's a freshman what school did you.
Go to i think um i went to pearl city.
High school parousia.
Yeah and i was he held himself with such.
Poise and it's definitely because of his.
Parents and you could see and i was just.
Like damn dude this guy's so respectful.
And steady trying to say about your.
Parents.
They're cool yeah they're very.
Respectful and there's a very nice and.
Very respectful very very different from.
You look i'm pretty sure dad don't wear.
Skirts are on the house now yeah.
Definitely not or your mom probably.
Laughter.
Because so what second place medal did.
You get will yeah.
None steve science fair nothing no oh we.
Did actually we got a dance second place.
Oh yeah dates no i mean world of dance.
That's the world's dude in the world he.
Second in the world's yeah that's just.
The name then there's country on dude.
That's then there's continents he did.
Worlds and you got second in world of.
Dance yeah it was uh 2018 or 17 or.
Something right so this past year i mean.
Excuse me yeah yeah i knew it.
Yeah we were all pretty young it's me.
Greg dana like we're all in a town yeah.
And it was a big deal cuz we were it was.
A big deal it was our first like big.
Bigger competition and dance right.
And there was this crew called choreo.
Cookies oh they're still around and.
They're always known as.
They're punahou to you they were there.
You're bad they're your puna home yeah.
And we were some ragtag nobodies who.
Were doing like really weird stuff like.
We would a lot of them would just wear.
Like a t-shirt or crew shirt and they.
Would just dance right and it would be.
Look really cool.
We had like full costumes and like skits.
And i did like a play we did like a play.
Where we were dancing we were not good.
At dancing so we had to like to think of.
We're good at like making people laugh.
And making moments you know in.
Storytelling you guys a good concept we.
Did and no one really did that bad and.
Like no one was really into that like.
The dance competitions were all about.
The dance just dancing yeah so we would.
Have like these big wooden sets that we.
Would have to like lug on and like weird.
Like props everywhere and we almost won.
By we almost beat them by like point.
Something was a really close really.
Close yeah i remember seeing that he's.
Outline i'm sure it is yeah well step.
Boys yeah the homeless one or no it was.
Yes i think we call it the bump the bump.
Show yeah.
And that the story of the show was i was.
A businessman and i lost my job and then.
Became like homeless and then there the.
Story was there was a group of homeless.
People that like took me in and showed.
Me the ways of of their world you know.
And then that that's i think this is.
This the ending of it was to be like.
Accepting because then the person who.
Had delivered me the message lost their.
Job and then i was like bringing him in.
At the end so it's kind of like this.
Store narrative right yeah yeah and so.
People were and we had like really cool.
Stunts yes that was like and then people.
Were in a way you guys kind of pioneered.
That concept of like storytelling maybe.
Like like mostly in our area i don't.
Really know elsewhere no yeah but it.
Like in the within the dance community.
Is kind of like a small thing so work.
Can spread fast sure and then there also.
Have been like prestigious crews who.
Have been like yo your idea like we.
Flipped it a little bit they told you.
That yeah.
Yeah and you know i don't want to say.
Like any names but there's been like.
Bigger crews that have bigger shows i.
Have said like they yeah we've allowed.
Them yeah some of our stuff say their.
Names can't no but that was our second.
Place story my second place story it was.
Really cool god you know what that means.
We're all a bunch of losers yeah losers.
Yeah we make it we make it there and.
Then we just do we don't finish yeah you.
Don't count you had first in wrestling.
Yeah but not in everything like i said.
We almost make it to the perfect level.
Of championship but we just don't quite.
Make it so that what that whole story we.
Talked about was all because paco said.
Think of something that you have.
Problems with you guys gotta stop me.
Because i don't even remember like.
Mid-sentence i'll forget what i'm.
Talking about and i'm moving on to.
Something else and doesn't matter.
Ya know that's what this podcast is i.
Know but at some point if i keep going.
Really off that's what you guys are here.
For someone's guy catch me and be like.
Hey we're not talking about that no yeah.
But the thing is like what you're.
Talking about there's good substance to.
It it's a good story there's no reason.
To cut it off sure yeah now if you're.
Just going off on something just then we.
Do that right yeah that's that's why.
This it's good so but i also don't.
Realize don't worry.
Yeah i'll bring it full full circle but.
Yeah i agree it's always retaining.
That's entertaining that's that's why.
I'm i've always had well not not always.
But whenever we go on dates mm-hmm oh it.
Would be a real issue.
Why ill you go on dates now no i like.
Back in the day if you go on and deal.
With a girl yeah or guy i guess the.
Talking part i would have to always be.
Conscious about like like i don't i.
Don't mind like talking to someone and.
We'll have a conversation but i have to.
Like it almost makes me more awkward.
Because i have to consciously be.
Thinking okay don't stay on topic.
Like don't take any meds back then yeah.
Yeah you know when i was like yeah like.
Especially like right out of like.
College and.
That time i was very awkward because i.
Think i would be consciously trying to.
Think like stay on top and yeah listen.
To what she's saying or sometimes i'm.
Not even there's not like a disrespect.
Thing or like i it happens to people i.
Respect the most i've told people this.
Before but like it's almost like the the.
One time i knew that i had i knew when i.
Was a kid but like i knew something was.
Weird.
Yes i would have like you know like my.
Um i grew up playing basketball and judo.
And they would call you in for huddle's.
Right and they would explain the play.
Let's say basketball they would explain.
To our coach would explain the play and.
Be like i would always get yelled at.
Because i would never know what the play.
Was about after we broke the huddle so.
Like as i got older this is from ages.
Five to 13 i would keep consciously.
Trying to tell myself okay pay attention.
Right pay attention and then i don't.
Know where break i was like oh my gosh.
Trying so hard to pay attention that i.
Didn't hear anything and i would always.
Get yelled at but i really want i didn't.
Want to get yeah i don't have to run.
Suicides or sprints and i would always.
Have to cuz i never knew what the hell.
Was going on so like that's how i knew.
Like okay me how do you like oh i would.
Always wonder like how do people.
Remember this stuff it's not that i.
Couldn't remember the time at the time i.
Thought it was a memory thing yeah but.
It was like i just can't be attention.
Yeah yeah it is and and it is i didn't.
Realize until i took meds for the first.
Time later in life which is in college.
And it was actually my prescription it's.
Not one of those like underground like.
Buy because everybody was trying to get.
Adderall back in like in college yeah.
It's like a popular thing now mm-hmm but.
I didn't think it was it wasn't even.
Called adderal back then it was.
Something else ritalin riddle i don't.
Know if it was well they might have to.
Be ritalin and then i think they i don't.
I think it's people still use really i.
Think it's for different things maybe i.
Don't know right but well regardless i.
Think i told this story did i tell this.
Already.
I don't think so on the first two hot.
Gas in the consigui anyway yeah that's.
Hot that's for people out there if.
You're curious if you had kind of have.
Adhd that's what it's like cuz i there's.
No way i would have known if i didn't.
Take medicine ah this is what other.
People get to experience naturally yeah.
I'm guys can read a book and it's not a.
Big deal yeah.
I remember they would do those tests in.
School where they would test your.
Comprehension and like your if you could.
Read something and then kind of tell it.
Back to them did they ever do that to.
You like in school like with the first.
Time i got tested it was when i was in.
Preschool and they thought uh they said.
They did say i had adhd but my mom.
Refused to put me on meds right probably.
Would have been school would have been.
So much easier yeah but i mean i still.
Got good grades growing up yeah it's a.
Weird flex huh i did get good grades but.
I kind of cheated a lot weird flex but.
Certainly that's an odd contraction of.
Muscles but was that the right time to.
Use it though tries to keep me up to.
Date with the little kids.
Just a little cuz sometimes well i.
Always use it wrong yeah but the thing.
Is also i think there's moments where.
You do it on purpose like i exactly know.
That was right that one was correct yeah.
But there's a lot of times you.
Ironically oh yeah sometimes right yeah.
As like a joke on the music what was i.
Talking about.
Weird flex but okay but what was the.
Flexing about how you got grades even.
Though you oh oh yeah i got diagnosed.
When i was today yeah okay the only one.
Who thinks those kinds of saints have.
Like an expiration date like two days.
Before they're like i don't know yeah.
Like i think it's a matter of how much.
People use it yeah mmm but it's also i.
Think in a way for our group it's almost.
Been like don't just follow trends you.
Know and i think it's kind of been what.
It's kind of been drilled into can we.
Follow trends try to i try to keep up.
With trends i'm just always late no but.
You yeah you're very late and then you.
Also do it in a way that's like still.
Didn't eat yet guys.
Let's eat i'm really hungry time to eat.
I don't know if it's necessarily been.
Drilled into us i think the majority of.
Us we're it's just in our nature to not.
I don't know when i make those if i.
Ever make like a joke like that.
Sometimes part of me feels like i copied.
A joke uh-huh and it makes no to me it.
Makes me feel like yeah yeah yeah you.
Know it's not really a joke right like.
What does heat mean again no it's not.
That's just something people say no but.
If you said like oh yeah i get hit up.
All the time for bran deals and i yeah i.
Said oh weird flex what okay i'm making.
A joke and then we would all look at you.
Like yeah but but i think that's also.
Why like you know you know how you just.
Don't copy trends like if people are.
Doing challenges and stuff oh i see what.
You're saying yeah yeah.
So in a way all of us are kind of just.
Like yeah but you're making you're right.
Now you're weird flexing but okay to us.
Right now you're like oh we're too good.
For me but no but but we liked i like.
Them i don't see it really late i do too.
I just don't want to do them i don't say.
That like yeah yeah i laugh at them but.
I don't use them as like in my arsenal.
Yeah like i know once something gets so.
Overdone i get upset seeing it honestly.
And then it becomes a joke in itself.
Yeah yeah just why i think it's so like.
The dab is really knowing for a while.
And then i thought it was so funny every.
Time i saw like mini mint or do it doing.
It like yeah yeah dan i think that's.
Like a whole another different level.
Yeah of comedy not like a different see.
Right now where we were flexing but okay.
That's okay dude dude definitely odd.
Contraction in our muscles but certainly.
Anyway um how do we get on this topic.
See this is the bad thing i should have.
Took my pill during the shishi break.
Honestly i think the last official topic.
We talked about was paco said what.
Bothers you yeah that didn't even go.
Anywhere.
I wouldn't talk that's why i told you.
Like so that's what no no it's fine it's.
All we're looking for is the seed that.
We can plant and then viciously whatever.
It better fractures off into okay what.
Bothers me tell them i don't know dude.
Grab my sleeve that bothers me as well i.
Don't know i don't know what bothers me.
I was like no way.
I don't really i'd have to see here i.
Think about it because it's not really.
Something that i can just pull out of my.
I have a lot of things so what i do.
Every day write about things that bother.
Me.
What get them for one let me tell you.
About ikea let's see i mean there's so.
Many things you know actually one thing.
That does kind of bother me but it's.
Like it shouldn't i don't i didn't i.
Never understood why people hate.
Nickelback so much that's i know it's.
Super random but i was just thinking.
About it the other day yeah cuz i heard.
A nickelback song cuz i was watching was.
It grey's anatomy i don't know i was.
Watching some really old show yeah they.
Had a nickelback song i don't know what.
Show it was might have not even been.
Nickelback but it reminded me and i was.
Like dude they're not bad like why does.
People like why do people hate them so.
Much you know trying to think of a.
Nickelback song is that the i remember.
Though there's a music video in there i.
Don't have the rights to that we might.
Have to bleep it just kidding out i was.
In look at this picture this picture.
Take a glance at the picture yeah i.
Still think that one vine is hella funny.
Was like what no but no but you know.
What i mean everybody that's like the i.
Know it because i go team yeah it's a.
Go-to but i've always like if you i.
Guess kids wouldn't get it now cuz.
They're not popular but back in the day.
They were playing all the time and.
Nobody had an issue with them i thought.
Photograph was a great song yeah and.
There's voices very like you know like.
It's very unique but i don't know.
There's things like that and that made.
Me think of other things that people are.
I feel like they just jump on the trend.
Yeah of like hating nickelback and we're.
Like well auto-tune anything auto-tune.
Sounds awful that's not true there's a.
Lot of other than that i really like.
Hearing yeah yeah you know like but that.
Became a thing right um there's i mean.
Crocks is something that people like.
Yeah yeah i mean but yeah yeah but i.
Mean i understand the crocks one what i.
Like rocks i i think they're comfortable.
Yeah i think they're goofy but they have.
Theirs they you know what i didn't think.
About it the real my real reason for not.
Liking them initially was the holes.
The holes made me feel weird i will have.
That thing i get like goose bumps just.
Thinking about the holes is it.
Trypophobia or something like that i can.
Get it i just don't wanna i don't want.
It to happen so i'm not trying to think.
Of holes right now my get that pretty.
Bad that goose that you get creeped out.
By holes like just seeing like those.
That that thing you know all the bumps.
Next to each other was it called i tried.
Before something like that yeah look at.
This oh yeah you got bouncy a little bit.
You know what that you know what kind of.
Trigger me like i don't i don't think i.
Have that but definitely seeing those.
Patterns is weird at your old house.
There were these dead sunflowers in a.
Vase mm-hmm looking i was like oh why.
Why do you have that there i don't even.
Know what you're talking about so i.
Probably didn't even notice it or look.
At it right at your doorway i don't come.
Through that way oh that's right i don't.
Go through the front door at my own.
House the thing that i didn't like about.
Crocs enough in the very beginning was.
That.
Paco's were so like crusty and oh he got.
Me a new pair and i start wearing kind.
Of fresh honey i bought him crocs for.
His birthday he just like did not use it.
Because he went back to using his dirty.
Ass ones no because it was he body he.
Didn't buy me the og ones yeah i got.
Some cool looking what's about what's.
Cool none of it is cool you didn't get.
Us og once no i did i'm confused no the.
Original style yeah i got him some cool.
Looking like it's like a different one.
Because he has so many of the other ones.
See this is what he had a clothes told a.
Closed toe one but it had fur on the.
Inside and that was just weird to me it.
Was for winter yeah but it was just.
Weird to have fur on my feet yeah but.
For winter it might be nice you know i.
Figure you got regular crocs i'm gonna.
Get you this regardless if someone gets.
You a gift you should at least use it i.
Did use it you did not i used i used the.
Other one i never got him a gift since.
And that every time i would see at a.
Basketball game and you're like nice.
Yeah.
No usually like once yeah paco actually.
Got us all crocs for he did birthdays.
Mmm he's he converted us yeah.
It was you know what it is though it's.
Like it's just easy to slip on yeah like.
So yeah and i wouldn't wear it to like.
An event like how he would like call.
Paco would but wear it outside go ahead.
Just like or whatever really yeah yeah.
Yeah they're awesome.
Crocs ah dude i've been trying to get.
Outta business they closed all of their.
American business i think they're still.
In this so they could still be a sponsor.
Yeah i thought i've reached out to the.
Brand's we gotta get away from brands on.
This lake table alone what about post.
Malone he did a croc deal yeah i know.
