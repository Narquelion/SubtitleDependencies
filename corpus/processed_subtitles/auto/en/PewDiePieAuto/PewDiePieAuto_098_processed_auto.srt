Of development what's good what's it.
Gonna be you know people always comment.
On my channel that i came up with this.
Challenge.
Okay now that article 13 has passed i'm.
Pretty sure that i can copy strikes.
Everyone during the google challenge.
Because i came up with the first.
Actually it was my idea and i completely.
Stole it from her but regardless of that.
Mics i can't copy strike me she she's.
Not a youtuber anymore.
Googling myself 18-plus.
Probably googling myself my net worth in.
The title next one lies she knows and.
That's really what ever wants to know i.
Google myself challenge a markiplier i.
Google myself you know even wired what.
What do they do they call it.
Autocomplete just because they have.
Can't have google in the title but let's.
Get real here it's the same goddamn.
Story look at markiplier is in there i'm.
Only acting like this because i'm salted.
That i will never i will never happen.
Music.
You know the only good thing coming out.
Of these autocompletes is this clip is.
That like a personal attack my favorite.
Favorite two seconds is this a good.
Reference it's a good mean all right.
Let's start a incognito tab because i.
Need to google myself and i need fresh i.
Need the freshness okay done.
We google myself now what are we.
Immediately know from this information.
That's right everyone i'm 180 centimeter.
The perfect height there will never be a.
Better height than 180 people keep.
Saying oh he's so insecure about his.
Height oh yeah well then why does google.
Say i'm 180 apparently i made a graphic.
Novel in 2017 i wasn't aware of this but.
That's always good to know you know you.
Can learn a lot about yourself so it.
Says that i am known as pewdiepie a.
Swedish youtuber comedian and video game.
Player i'm a video game player not a.
Gamer i'm a video game player thank you.
Very much.
Best known for his video to video.
Content which is mainly consisted of.
Let's play commentaries i suppose my.
Library quan in the quantity speaking.
And that is not wrong people also search.
For markup i logan claimed this.
Knowledge panel what does that mean can.
I oh oh like for your best what so i can.
Change my height oh hell yes it's.
Happening boys hibernate oh it's review.
Time reality can be whatever i want.
I'm 181 okay why he mentions in his.
Latest google myself vide.
We're just happening right i'm sourcing.
Ass i go hasn't changed yet what.
Goddammit so i like these because they.
Had they summarize basically the main.
Questions people have about me which is.
Number.
One how much do does pewdiepie make a.
Day by forbes estimate he receives 12.
Million in 2015 according to the mana.
Nation.
This helps increase his net worth to 68.
Million the very old data isn't it gets.
Also made nearly 42 million in.
Merchandise what no way.
I wish jesus christ by the march guys.
I'm not made anywhere near that amount.
Three thousand four hundred dollars per.
Hour not bad for a university drop by i.
Don't know exactly how much i make per.
Day it doesn't seem too far off which is.
Pretty crazy when you think about it.
Money is such a i go right in the deep.
End but money is such an interesting.
Topic for me because i obviously didn't.
Start youtube to make money a sad thing.
I've learned is how much people value.
Money in a way or at least the idea of.
Money people look at money as something.
Undoubtedly good it couldn't possibly be.
Something negative to have money which.
Is understandably a strange concept for.
People to accept but you look at people.
That win the lottery and having money.
Then fundamentally changes their their.
Whole life you know not just how they.
View life but also how other people view.
Them and i think that's a change in.
Particular that i feel like i really.
Want to protect and that's the reason.
Why in a in a way i try to live modestly.
Because obviously i don't but in.
Considering how much i make i try to.
Delay modesty because i don't want to i.
Want to just live a normal life i don't.
Want it the money to change my life it's.
Great to have but if it it can also.
Obviously become a problem.
Millionaire ranks about why money's bad.
Okay i think it's important to note.
Those i know i think a lot of people.
Think oh if i only had money then it.
Would solve all this problem for me when.
It's not really true and also the.
Concept of when is it ever enough unless.
You have a goal of how much you want to.
Make if you've invested in the stock.
Market then having money is obviously a.
Stressful element as well because once.
You have money you're afraid of losing.
Money there's a lot of things to.
Consider.
That i think isn't brought up enough and.
I think a lot of people look at money in.
A way that oh they only had money all my.
Problems will be solved which i can say.
It's not true okay everyone is a blood.
Sucking vampire and they want your money.
And as soon as they know you have money.
They aren't coming for it okay that's my.
Little rant of the day here my goal is.
To save up a little bit so i can buy a.
House in japan and have enough to be.
Able to sustain myself for the future.
I'm gonna live a long life and i want to.
Be able to have it for a while as well.
You know that if anyone is wondering why.
You know maybe why does he still do.
Brand deals and all this stuff that's.
Why i have that's my goal and i think.
It's important to have a goal in mind.
What is peter pisan network okay this.
One says 20 million okay i would say.
It's definitely more than that.
What is pewdiepie famous for for lets.
Playing i guess that makes sense.
I don't think people now associate me.
With let's plays but that is what made.
Me become the beg you to ba it's pretty.
Crazy how much this channel has changed.
Over the years from screechie let's play.
Commentary too i just spit out a rice to.
Screechy meme commentary everyone that's.
Right now i'm really i'm really proud of.
Myself for making these decisions that.
At the time seemed really stupid but.
Obviously it paid off a really really.
Big time i think a lot of youtuber fell.
In the trap that they always have to.
Please their audience no matter what and.
That should be their main goal and and.
That's the kind of youtubers that end up.
Becoming sort of slaves to themselves.
And their own content and eventually it.
Just leads to the demise of the channel.
Because after a while people aren't.
Gonna be interested anymore if you're a.
Minecraft channel and you always just do.
Minecraft videos obviously you can find.
A lot of success in that don't get me.
Wrong after a while people are gonna get.
Tired of it although minecraft is a.
Terrible example it's closed clearly.
It's still very popular fortnight for.
Example you know that has a.
Owning people aren't gonna be always.
Looking for for tonight content i don't.
Know what i'm getting at the point was.
For me when i did horror videos.
It was getting exhausting every single.
Day i played horror games going ah ah.
And after a while it just wasn't funny.
It wasn't interesting and it wasn't.
Scary anymore so i kept making horror.
Videos even though i didn't like it and.
Then people got angry at me from not.
Getting scared and for not enjoying it.
Which is like what i wasn't getting out.
Of it anyway so then i stopped doing it.
And then people got angry why aren't you.
Playing horror games anymore and i.
Realize i'm not gonna be able to please.
End everyone so i might as well do what.
I enjoy and i think that was my point.
That's what really paid off who is the.
Richest youtuber i'm pretty sure i am.
Not the richest youtuber i i don't do.
These sort of mega deals i don't i'm not.
The big corporate yeah i would assume do.
Perfect probably makes a lot more money.
Than me just based on the fact that they.
Do these massive deals.
That's just pure speculation but i can.
See that i can also see ryan's toy.
Review making a lot more than me because.
Kids advertisement i don't know if they.
Advertise but it wouldn't surprise me if.
They made more than me again just pure.
Speculation i have no idea but at the.
Same time that's what these sites do as.
Well they don't know how much we make so.
It's always kind of annoying when people.
Accept these as face value they're like.
Oh my god he makes this much money.
That's crazy oh my god superwoman made.
This much that's crazy that they don't.
Know they're just coming up with numbers.
And a lot of times these are less.
Confirmed by management's that do the.
Deals for these people so they conflate.
The numbers as a way to get more money.
From brand deals as a way to justify.
Getting paid more format brand deals oh.
This person makes this much from brand.
Deals is pewdiepie still dating mars yet.
Hey marsha are we still dating she says.
Yes which youtuber has the most.
Subscribers ah.
Ah don't google that one next google.
Please what nationality's idubbbz.
Why is that in here he's american -.
Ninjas use samurai swords i don't know.
Why does this come in there's people i.
Have a brother know how to always joe g.
If i told her that jyoti please all.
Right let's say i move on with a google.
Myself and do some google autocomplete.
So i can go pt pi age 29    networth.
I like the money.
Per simulator what - per simulators.
Becoming relevant okay how about this is.
Pewdiepie moving to japan.
I wish okay it's a little complicated.
Getting a visa and all that stuff.
Apparently i spoke to a tax expert and.
They said it's actually a little.
Complicated now because of logan pole.
Because people associate youtuber.
Youtuber isn't recognized as a job in.
Japan or a lot of countries and then.
They mentioned that thanks to logan paul.
It's actually a little bit more.
Complicated thanks logan thanks a lot.
It's pd pi swedish yes yes i am swedish.
As you can tell.
Let me take you guys to my own time.
Alright hometown i really wanted to do.
This so i grew up in gothenburg i have.
Not been back here and so long where are.
We now okay yeah yeah there we go the.
Main square hey this is fun i have not.
Seen the thing is my two closest friends.
My family and my sister moved to.
Stockholm when i was living in italy for.
A short period so there's hasn't been a.
Moment for me to come back to gothenburg.
Even though it's technically my hometown.
I want to go to where where i used to.
Live off m mun this is the tram i would.
Always take home from school.
It means nothing to anyone but me.
Basically ah that's funny.
I was literally about to say it's very.
Rare to get like good weather in.
Gothenburg and they're actually super.
Look it's super sunny here and then you.
Can move forward and it's like this is.
What is actually like in gothenburg it's.
Like nope it's still sunny now okay this.
Is what is actually like in stockholm.
Gothenburg wherever i'm from no one.
Knows okay this is where i used to live.
This street very central here it is this.
Is my street i don't know it's just too.
Invasive like no one knows i know live.
Here anymore so this is the building and.
We would live on the top and hey man so.
Many funny stories but i don't know what.
I want to share i used to always if i.
Was bored at night i would always throw.
Snowballs and people walking i was so.
Drunk one time when i came home that i.
Threw up outside the window and for sure.
You know there's obviously a lot of.
Parking here but my parents out of all.
Cars that could be parked underneath my.
Parents car what's the one that took the.
Fall so my parents enter the car though.
My parents are leaving this morning look.
At the car then looking up see that it's.
Literally my window and they're like.
Okay well he did it that son of a.
But they were obviouly not mad about it.
I think they realized that normally they.
I remember they said it they were like.
Usually you're not bad so you're okay.
Very nice parents i have this i realize.
This video just became something.
Completely different but this is what i.
Want to do okay let's go to where i.
Actually grew up though because i only.
Lived my teenage years in this centre.
This is a road that i grew up there's a.
House super cute road then my best.
Friend would live in this house so we.
Were literally neighbors oh this is not.
A privacy problem yeah that's the house.
I grew up in oh they build out the.
Balcony super nice neighborhood i'm very.
Thankful for my parents for letting we.
Grew up in such a great place so weird.
To look back at these things oh my god.
They cut down the tree there was this.
Ginormous.
Apple pear tree here and my parents.
Would literally always make me clean up.
All the pears okay i take back.
Everything nice i said about my parents.
Okay they would always make me clean up.
The pears and there were so many goddamn.
Pears they were so big so many pears.
There was apple trees over here and i.
Have to clean that up too.
I need to cut the grass on this hail how.
Do you even do that and then we were.
Responsible for the snow on this.
Staircase is there anyone falls and dies.
That would be our fault so they would.
Always send me out to scoop the snow how.
Could they how could they treat me like.
This this takes me back man all right.
Enough with that let's go back to why.
We're here.
It's pd pie no no i'm not vegan.
I guess i'm pescetarian basically i just.
Eat fish and no other meats so she is.
Too good to give up one of the reasons.
Why was when we shot scared pretty pie.
Season two i had to interact with a.
Bunch of pigs and they were so cute it's.
Like i don't want to eat these my my.
Moral is that i would i eat what i would.
Kill i don't like the idea of making.
This uncomfortable act of killing.
Something so easy it's pewdiepie.
American no still dating my it's p pi.
Russian it's pretty pi good what a great.
Question no no i'm not.
Why is pewdiepie chairs so expensive.
Laughter.
It's a high-quality chair with italian.
Leather and fashion why is pewdiepie so.
Hot when is pd pi birthday getting.
Married secret but this year can.
Pewdiepie speak japanese yeah yes.
No i'm true very slowly very very slowly.
Like trying to learn 10pt pi sing with.
Auto-tune yes speak russian.
No but my parents taught me a little bit.
Of russian when i was growing up so i.
Know how to read the letters more or.
Less and i i mean i know a few words.
Mean years with felix.
Yeah roberta you a youtube when i was.
Young people thought russia was gonna be.
The new big country and it obviously.
Became china instead so they thought oh.
It'd be good for him to learn russian.
Thanks for nothing russia you'd really.
Did it can pee deep i sue the median it.
Depends i get this question a lot like.
Why don't you just sue the media bla bla.
Bla bla bla i think the thing is that.
You have to prove that what they wrote.
They actually wrote knowing that it was.
False or something like that which is.
Kind of hard to prove i think maybe if i.
Look into it there could be some case.
Somewhere but i really just care about.
Making videos right now right now use.
Media i might change my mind so you.
Better behave which will bring me to the.
Final tangent that i have been going on.
On this video which is pewdiepie versus.
The media i thought about it recently.
And it's like there's a completely.
Different version of me existing in the.
Eyes of of people that read these.
Articles about me and as opposed to the.
People that actually watch my videos and.
I think it's always because people that.
Watch my channel know who i am and.
And i think you have a pretty good.
Understanding of what my values are and.
That i'm not this horrible person that i.
Am have portrayed as in the media.
Obviously a lot of it is self-inflicted.
Like yes i have done a lot of these.
Mistakes but i think if you if you.
Constantly reinforce the negative only.
The negative things that someone has.
Done you're gonna create an ugly picture.
Of a person i think no matter who you.
Are if you constantly list all the.
Shortcomings of any person that person.
Will be it look like a really bad person.
Then there is never a balance or very.
Rarely at least a balance story about me.
About the good that this channel has.
Done and all the positive things it's.
Always just the negative things listed.
And i think that's why for.
People i exist is like a completely.
Different character it's interesting i.
Think i will kind of give enough like i.
Don't really care about what people that.
Don't watch me think about me knowing.
That other people still know the truth.
In a way and i find comfort in that then.
I don't feel like i need to go in some.
Sort of oh guys i'm actually a really.
Good person look look how much money we.
Donated to charity i'm so great look at.
All these videos and success it's so.
Great now i'm not about that even though.
I literally just brought it up thank you.
