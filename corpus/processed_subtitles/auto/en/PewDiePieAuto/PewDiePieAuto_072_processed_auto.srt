Heart.
Now who is neil breen you ask well hi.
Thanks for checking out my crowdfunding.
Site my name is neil breen i'm a.
Filmmaker i'm in the process of.
Producing my fourth legitimate feature.
Film neil breeding is a legitimate.
Filmmaker and i made videos on his.
Previous work in the past which is.
Nothing short of oscar-worthy.
Performance wife's director weiss.

Can't help you out of this one jim we've.
All we've been through i can't pull you.
Out of this one.
Can't pull you out of this one what can.
I say neil is the bass i love this.
Background that he chose it says so much.
And so little at the same time which is.
Actually a great way to describe his.
Film now a couple a couple of days ago.
Me and some friends in brighton we.
Watched it another one of his films one.
Of his older work called the double down.
Now why don't we double down together.
And go through this masterpiece.
Neal breen psychological thriller double.
Down it's a masterpiece i'm not gonna.
Lie it's a little light it's a little.
Hard to sit through there are some.
Moments i'm questioning why i watch this.
Film but there are those golden moments.
And that's what we're gonna focus on.
Today's so the film starts up with this.
Lovely footage of clouds and you think.
Wow this actually looks pretty great i.
Like the music it's made by neal green.
We don't know what neal brain has done.
But we know that he is involved in this.
Field there's now i know what you're.
Asking yourself will there be another.
Neal green text on the screen please i.
Need to see more neal brief text on the.
Screen don't worry it is coming there's.
Got to be patient because this video.
Because this film has to be in our 30.
Minutes so that it can be quite where.
Producers writen and directed by neil.
Brain incredible actually like this.
Shots i don't i can't complain too much.
It goes through this i could thank.
Beautiful there he is.
Look at those sideburns aaron brown.
Aaron i always thought i was doing the.
Right thing and preparing for life i was.
The first in my class in college and.
Computers okay all you need to know.
About this character literally you don't.
Need to know anything besides say he's a.
Hacker.
He's a genius i don't know he's there's.
A lot of things okay perhaps most.
Importantly he enjoys eating tuna at.
Akane's i don't need much to live on.
Anymore.
I just eat tuna out of the can and live.
In the car.
You know for being a genius he's really.
Bad at eating tuna while driving oh neil.
Oh that was close.
That was real close this is why you.
Never eat tuna out of a can while.
Driving please let this be a learning.
Lesson for all of you out there now.
Mercenary for any nation it's gonna be a.
Lot of shots i'm not gonna lie there's.
Gonna be a lot of shots of neil breen.
Running through rocks and if that's not.
Your cup of tea then then you're just a.
Hater.
And this movie isn't for you so you can.
Just back away okay you can just get.
Away from here we ain't got time for.
This.
I want to watch neil breathe remove my.
Life one look at that and look at that.
Claim absolutely incredible or get he.
Married you know as a passionate fan of.
Neil breen's work there is a car there.
Are a couple current beams one of them.
Being an excessive use of laptops neil.
Breen loves to use laptops why use one.
Laptop when he's can use two laps down.
To assess and why use one phone and.
Break you can use two phones.
Simultaneously no one abuses laptops.
Like neil breen don't know nail yeah.
Don't do it neil don't do it god damn it.
Me a look first book me don't hit that.
Book with them god damn can't wait any.
Longer i don't care how angry you are go.
God damn e you don't don't not again my.
God not it.
Someone stop this man i know you're.
Upset it has a deeper meaning i'm just.
Really glad that laptop has made it an.
Apparent here as well.
Satellite dishes five laptops six oh.
He's got five laptops six oh there are.
Very dangerous wars going on that will.
Never end he's talking about t-series.
Vs. pewdiepie that's right i snuck that.
One in there so neil green is basically.
Like an undercover agent type of really.
Hard to explain.
Neil brain character is like a super.
Rogue agent to secret war underground.
Desert-dwelling.
Character i disappear he can disappear.
Home and he also has a force field which.
Is pretty much filled with cause for.
Shield sir if an intruder the force.
Shield will cause death if an intruder.
Draws near just letting you guys know.
That that's the thing that neil breen.
Has this is important for the plot and.
Story no it isn't but that is not.
Necessary in neil breen's films okay you.
Just don't understand three laptops at.
The same time port or truth.
How many laptops do you use at the same.
Time huh one two threes but there's no.
Waiver is that way it's therefore there.
Is far own but there is for laptops i.
Didn't see the fourth one my mind sorry.
Guys i gotta rewrite this review so now.
We have more shots of neo brain running.
Around in the desert an excellent.
Climber and an excellent athleticism but.
He's about to find something in these.
Rocks now place your bets in the.
Comments please what do you think neil.
Brain is gonna find in the rocks.
The winner gets gets to smash like on.
This video what is he finding.
Another laptop everyone the fifth laptop.
Makes this appearance.
Yep that's a laptop yep.
Confirmed it is in fact a laptop.
Remember we were seven and it was love.
At first sight we loved each other since.
Because you have matching pants is that.
Why neal there he is again with the.
Laptops now to be clear here we are 17.
Minutes into the film and we haven't.
Seen or heard any dialogue whatsoever.
It's just been nothing but this and neal.
Breen talking over the footage there was.
An error in the calculation okay all.
Right but let's go to the best fit in my.
Opinion of the entire film it starts off.
With the footage of a very public pool.
As you can see here then cut to neal.
Brain beam naked in this pool with naked.
Lady i love you will you marry me yes.
Yes yes i will marry.
You can tell she really feels strongly.
About this clip now i definitely want to.
Be in this shot okay i guess what i want.
To show myself as much as possible i'm.
So happy i can't wait to be your wife o.
Neill b nail breathe that's a laser.
We'll always be together.
I need to know that watch out neal.
Breathe how does she not see the laser.
It is possible anything's possible.
Thank you watches jeez.
Is it me or is it hot in here god damn.
That was sexy ah ah.
I cannot recreate that fantastic sound.
Only one man jeez that is the shriek of.
Pure agony now if you thought this whole.
Scenario was obscure enough i guess we.
It gets a spear.
Okay sure oh not the flower.
Okay cut to her then wait for it.
Music.
Yes thank you very much neil breen for.
That immaculate shot beautiful fantastic.
Art and he's gone oh okay there he is.
I find myself waking up on the ground pj.
Pointed out this when we watched at it.
It's like we see him waking up from the.
Ground we don't need him i'm sorry nia i.
Don't think what he need him pointing.
Out that he's waking up from the ground.
As much as i love the soothing sound of.
Neil greene's buttery voice just just a.
Thought the whole plot of the film kind.
Of sounds like neil greene's personal.
Thoughts i don't know how to explain it.
But showing this i'm always amazed that.
How governments all over the world are.
So concerned about nuclear missiles and.
Nuclear bombs and all the very expensive.
And secret technology involved.
The reality is that chemical and.
Biological weapons can be much more.
Destructive to societies and economies.
In nuclear weapons all right alex jones.
All right thank you appreciate it.
Oh he's laying on the ground again.
Now wait what just happened did he wake.
Up or did he find himself waking up in.
The ground is that what happened neil.
You're not explaining what's going on.
Just got a check if pretty pie stone.
Winning over t-series okay they're fine.
I've received their directions now.
Introducing the greatest character of.
All time neil breen is walking through.
The desert in the middle of nowhere and.
He stumbles upon none other than desert.
Santa desert santa everyone he sits in.
The desert i don't know what desert.
Santa does now unfortunately don't get.
Too attached to desert santa i know as i.
Love him dearly as well but deserts.
Ain't that the old man you don't look.
Like a tourist to me then don't point.
Your gun at him neil brain its desert.
Santa.
Where does he go in that's some fine.
Climbing meal.
What is desert santa gonna do follow him.
There's no way desert santa can follow.
Him that was some way too tricky of a.
Path no one could ever do that no one.
Has to parkour skills to follow neoprene.
In the desert.
Neal breen knows this of course no no it.
Was a goddamn me he shouldn't have tried.
To follow neoprene the path was too.
Strict he got outplayed desert santa.
Outplayed son i was drawn to him i felt.
I knew his spirit now this is actually a.
Love story between neal and desert santa.
Which is quite tear breaking the blood.
Is gone from his head but he's still.
Dying what are you saying deserts ain't.
Him.
Lend me your wisdom he gave him what did.
He gave him.
Music.
The desert santa stone.
Music.
That's a nice shot and that's a nice.
Barrett you just just put some rock over.
Him he'll be fine.
He gets he's alive he's just sleeping in.
His rocker babe.
Then we have neela visiting his parents.
I guess i don't i don't know what's.
Happening here i like this i like this.
Shot it's kind of aesthetic dad it's.
Like a good wallpaper we are filled with.
Love and we are at peace well that's.
Nice.
So apparently even if you're dead you.
Can still not properly walk in it still.
Hurts to walk on gravel and stone how.
About that hey that just looks painful.
All that we do is drive around and get.
Caught up in spectacular car chases and.
Dude buildings blowing up and wild.
Gunfire and so on that only happens in.
The movies and on tv it really doesn't.
Happen in real life in a real life.
Everything we do is done very silently.
Undercover and electronically the public.
Never knows what we're doing it's all.
Done in very very secret ways i'm so.
Water please.
Can i have some water please okay yes.
Speaking of secrets there is one i want.
To share with you my daughter megan was.
Just diagnosed with brain cancer no no.
I'm sorry.
That sucks what a lovely miam looks.
Delicious.
She's got brain cancer so he's putting.
His hand on her brain now back to more.
Footage of neil breen climbing my.
Favorite footage i could watch this my.
Entire life look at things look at those.
Moves grab the rock oh no no i grabbed.
It anyway that helped that helped him on.
The line oh no it didn't you grab.
Another rock neil he got the rock.
Fantastic.
Is he gonna make it up he made it up no.
One else can do that it's me give me the.
President contact has been out what in.
That what is happening at this point i.
Don't really know what happens in the.
Middle of the film it's one big blur to.
Be honest and we're just gonna we're.
Just gonna skip let's move away from the.
Cars they may be wired.
Watch this extremely smooth oh sorry.
That's okay.
No damage there's a bug device on the.
Car now how are you i don't really know.
What's going on to be honest i don't i.
Like the bit where nothing happened and.
It didn't make any sense this is the.
Metal gear solid play.
What does that even mean so neal green.
Drugs this couple kills the guy and when.
The lady wakes up this is what he has to.
Say.
Music.
We're in las vegas last night we went to.
The club danced a lot drank a lot.
Laughed a lot and had sex out by the.
Fountains then we went down to the strip.
And we got married.
Hey this is las vegas baby.
Imagine you wake up you don't know where.
You are.
Neil brain shows up and says last night.
We drank a lot.
We had sex by the fountains we laughed a.
Lot and then we went down to the strip.
And got married.
Hey las vegas baby what do you do what.
Would you do if this happened to you.
What we're married.
Then literally ten seconds later get out.
Get out the marriage is over.
Marriage is over.
This carla had a once-in-a-lifetime.
Opportunity to marry neoprene and it.
Only lasted five seconds gosh damn it.
Ten seconds well at least you.
Experienced those 10 seconds of pure joy.
And bliss and love i'm pretty sure neil.
Isn't supposed to need that skull but i.
Like the touch anyway.
Hey look it's more neil running in the.
Desert jess look at him go look at him.
Go.
Oh excuse me contact literally literally.
Me when i accidentally bump into someone.
Oh excuse me contact so relatable i.
Think that's why i like his films.
They're just really able another.
Reoccurring theme in needle spoons that.
Ferraris that's right is that the sake.
No it's the same ferrari i can't help.
You out of this one jim.
He just took jim's ferrari he loved that.
Car i don't know if there's any point of.
Me explaining what's going on i think.
It's better to just appreciate these.
These golden moments like this one for.
Example holy    it's him yeah it's him.
How can that be how can that be possible.
Music.
I was wondering what happened to all the.
Tuna cans.
Does he recycle them or does he just.
Have a cardboard box in his trunk.
Where he keeps all the tuna cans and i'm.
Just really glad that we finally had the.
Answer what happens to all the tuna cans.
Neil green leaves no questions.
Unanswered now of course in the end we.
Get to see one of the best neil green.
Running.
And screaming okay go nia.
Run like the wind nut run like you've.
Never run before.
Music.
How long is this how long is this gonna.
Keep okay so the movie ends with neil.
Green walking away with nothing.
His girl.
Music.
Or nothing.
I don't know but the most important part.
Of the end is actually the credits.
Because we have directed by neil brief.
Musical director neil green editor neil.
Pre production designer neil bri.
Production manager neil green casting.
Neil green and most importantly lighting.
None makeup and hair none locations neil.
