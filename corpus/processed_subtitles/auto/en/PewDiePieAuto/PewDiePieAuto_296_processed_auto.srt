Music.
How's it going everyone new camera.
Doesn't it look good wow.
Keep changing the game how does he keep.
Improving i don't know i just keep.
Outdoing myself.
Step by step as you can tell i'm back.
In the beautiful can you tell i used to.
Sit down here basically down there i'm.
Not on the floor i'm sorry i'm sorry i.
Thought i'd do a random update video cuz.
I haven't i didn't know what to film and.
I thought there's a lot of changes like.
New camera why is he doing that.
What's happening it felt like a good.
Time okay so grab your favorite g fuel.
And let's do this.
Why am i not on the floor felix well the.
Answer might shock you i don't like how.
My back hurts from sitting on the floor.
It was a good meme i'll probably return.
At some point but for now it's nice it.
Chairs are ok i feel ashamed just saying.
That just the way that came out i don't.
Deserve this tambourine the reason i'm.
Here again is because i caused a.
Quarantine basically we're more.
Comfortable in this location and i.
Didn't want to pack my camera because.
It's huge so i'm using myself a hundred.
Million subs subscribe please i got a.
New camera coming that it's a little.
Smaller i order one online so don't.
Worry ok i'm not this is not the.
Standard even though it should be i mean.
Look at this it's beautiful looks like a.
Shitty webcam i've been really enjoying.
Making videos lately i hope you guys.
Like them as well and especially doing.
The live streams i'm so glad i'm.
Live-streaming lysa bus check it out.
It's so fun we had some great moments.
Where you guys trolled me.
Me not remembering what the characters.
Names are i don't know the interaction.
That with the chat and playing a game.
Has been really fun and it everything.
About membership and live streams has.
Just taken me back to old school to.
Youtube where i feel like i'm i have a.
Closer connection to an audience and.
Doing laia lets place again which is.
Something that i've always been very.
Scared of doing because less place is.
Such a huge commitment for the channel.
There's so many uploads and once you.
Start one you have to finish it like i.
Always do i finish all my games and a.
Lot of times there's a huge disconnect.
Between your audience and what you enjoy.
Sometimes games are fun to play but.
They're not fun to watch and it's hard.
To find games that fit both but i feel.
Like with live streaming it doesn't.
Really matter we can just have fun.
Anyway lots of us a lot of people like.
It last of all a lot of people who can.
Hate it either way it's it's been fun to.
Play it so i'm really happy about that i.
Look forward to do more.
Let's place in the future some more.
Gaming stuff this channel was originally.
A gaming channel that's what i always.
Seen this channel but it's sort of.
Progressed and into do all kinds of.
Different things i feel like i've made.
Every video possible at this point but.
And i always felt awkward like there's.
So many people subscribe to this channel.
For so many different reasons and i.
Never know what to do with the gaming.
Stuff and now i feel like yeah i figure.
It out i'll livestream it it'll be.
Really cool let's see i had some.
Questions this is like a video i made.
Like back in 2011 on a shitty webcam i.
Prepared some questions like the first.
Riders would pewdiepie hey should we.
Call this friday or some pewdiepie let's.
Yeah hey guys okay luke asked do you.
Think you'll do more or less plays like.
You're doing last of us because i'm.
Really enjoying the two to three hour.
Live streams well that yeah yeah.
Basically yes i've already answered that.
Goes some tsukushi my next i think after.
And terraria of course we're not giving.
Up on that because i finish all my games.
Thank you very much.
Are you going to live go some sushi.
Tsushima you yes again looks fun so yeah.
I mentioned in a video that very briefly.
That me and marks everything.
Moving to japan we have a house there.
Now and due to quarantine we can't go.
There there's a lot of different reasons.
Why i don't really feel like everyone.
Needs to know every single nuance of.
That detail but that's i'm planning.
We're planning to go there in the future.
Sometime whenever we can this is very.
Very very complicated will you do a.
Review of the last of us part two i.
Personally would love to hear your.
Opinion about it when you finish because.
Your channel got me buying a playstation.
4 and to play last time whether what.
Part well that's funny it's such a.
Polarizing game and it's a god i hate it.
So much not not the game at this point i.
Just hate how people are just losing.
Their mind over this game either people.
Are defending it to death like notes you.
Just hate it because you hate women or.
Or if you like it then there's something.
Wrong with you it's like who cares i.
Think there's a lot there's so much.
Politics around it and i haven't seen.
Anyone really discuss it properly but i.
Need to finish the game first i might do.
It afterwards because i think the.
Politics has a lot of decisions on what.
Drove the story in terms of personal.
Decisions but i can only speculate when.
Are you bringing out more music you.
Hinted there was something a while ago.
But nothing came wow well me and dave.
Have been working for a long time slow.
Down a bit because of quarantine but.
More it is coming i think we have a lot.
But we want to make sure it's good so it.
Might take a while it might take a long.
While which i think is fine i but yeah.
If i'm not live-streaming it probably.
Means i'm working on music it's been.
Really fun i'm glad i'm doing that with.
Dave since your streaming partnership.
With youtube happen to me and things.
Appear to be in good terms is there any.
Hope for scare pewdiepie season 2 got it.
It's been so long ago at this point i'm.
Just like whatever who knows.
Never say never right i don't know only.
The future can tell i feel like it's.
Been so dated now that if it came out.
Now it just it wouldn't even make sense.
I think for the sake of people working.
On it it would be nice to get a.
Conclusion but who knows could you do.
More vlog like content i think a lot of.
People would be interested to have a.
Peek.
To you in marcel's everyday life well.
Now during quarantine there's not much.
To do every day feels i could say exact.
Same day i think once we're in japan.
Yeah i would definitely love to do that.
It's fun for memories too looking back.
In old videos it's nice to have that log.
So i think what once said this whole.
Thing is over hopefully soon yeah look.
Forward today this is a very chill video.
How about that a lot of people have been.
Suggesting i do more philosophy videos.
Those have probably been my most.
Requested videos i don't like i can't.
Just make them hey i need to think about.
It because they're so deep i need to sit.
Down in the forest for a couple hours.
For days no it's just that if i have.
Something random that i feel like i'm.
Talking about i'll make a video about it.
But i can't just decide to do it it just.
Sort of happens so even though they were.
Heavily requested which i really really.
Appreciate because the advice they do.
Terribly it doesn't matter because i.
Enjoy making them but i'm also glad that.
A lot of people request them has the new.
Video schedule with brakes worked out.
For you both in terms of how the channel.
Has been doing and how you feel about.
Recording videos channel is doing great.
But i don't know on my day off so i.
Still tend to work on side projects and.
Other things like that and it's hard to.
Like people are already asking about the.
Music stuff and i shouldn't have said.
Anything.
Yeah i'm really bad at taking days off.
Hey that's on me really it's hard when.
You enjoy it so much like in my day off.
I would love to stream all day but i.
Also want to do other things in my life.
As well but it's so easy oh i got a.
Couple hours free i'll go live that kind.
Of thing which isn't work anyway but i.
Think the five uploads a week is pretty.
Good it gives me time to reset the week.
Instead of everything just flowing into.
One thing and i can kind of reflect on.
Last week what worked what didn't and.
Give more thought into it even though i.
Don't but i can if i want to okay geez.
Are you planning on reviewing or.
Suggesting any more books in the future.
I always find your book videos really.
Interesting there we go again stop at.
Home just kidding thank you i'm still.
Reading just.
As avidly as i used to last year or the.
Year before so i probably won't do the.
Same format i think i want to make a.
Video kind of explaining why you should.
Read kind of like my workout video or.
Something i don't know i feel like.
Reading and working out has been the two.
Best changes i made in my life in terms.
Of personal growth and feeling good.
About myself i feel like everyone should.
Do it and i want to inspire more people.
To do it as well so if i can make that.
Into a video i think that could be a.
Really cool thing are you going to take.
Another break anytime soon i might do.
The january meme again honestly i've.
Been thinking about it.
It was really nice i feel like it's fair.
Any other job you get holidays i don't.
Really do that and this year especially.
Has been kind of crazy so yeah i.
Probably do that in january to be honest.
It was good for my mental health i think.
They're like my fear is that even if i.
Enjoy myself i don't want my whole life.
To pass by doing the same thing if that.
Makes sense.
Even if i love it you know i'm getting.
Old guys i'm 30 i gotta say i did not.
Expect me to sit here ten years later.
From when i started no way this.
Is crazy.
Answering questions things are so.
Different but still so so much the same.
It's kind of crazy what's important.
About being a minimalist how to start.
Things it's funny cuz i sent all my.
Clothes off to japan so i had no clothes.
I literally you can probably tell i'm.
Wearing like a black shirt in every.
Video or my own march i think i talked.
About this a little before but i i think.
The word means something different for.
Everyone for me it's just about caring.
For the stuff i have i think you can be.
The richest person in the world and have.
All the items in the world but if you.
Don't care for what you have and you.
Have too much of it you're not gonna.
Appreciate it and i think that's just.
The mentality to be thankful for what.
You have to me at least i remember you.
Know mark zuckerberg wears the same.
Shirts every day and he said it it was.
Because he he needs to make a lot of.
Decisions in that way he doesn't have to.
Deal with it and that sounded so stupid.
When i heard.
But but now someone in my position that.
Gets so many questions every single day.
That it's definitely real like the.
Fatigue of answering even small stuff.
Like stupid questions like that are nice.
I'm still i can't deal with it sometimes.
And here i am answering questions how.
Ironic i think it's just being there in.
The position i am people want things.
From me all the time which is fine but.
It just gets hard to keep up booooo-whoo.
Me.
I know opinions on ninja and scare.
Situation if any i have not heard about.
This and i'm very glad i haven't cuz i'm.
So tired of people's i.
Don't care like so i don't know what.
This is about but it's like someone's.
Someone you is getting cancer all every.
Day today the earth is dying it don't.
Matter what does your new setup look.
Like that is a great question i'll show.
A picture actually even better i can.
Literally just move this one camera can.
I look at that yes i'm playing tat.
Titans sue me this is my portable setup.
Basically fits in a suitcase it's.
Alright it works that's all he needs to.
Do it works any plans of dropping shoes.
Ooh who knows who knows wink wink wink.
How are you doing these days oh why.
Thank you for asking.
I'm doing really good i'm so happy i.
Feel like i finally came in terms with.
Myself realized not everything will.
Always be perfect you just got to be.
Happy with where you are i'm in a good.
Place anyway so i have every reason to.
Be but there's something i thought about.
Especially with all the drama that goes.
On online there's always a new drama a.
New topic and people just like small.
Things seems to be so big online and it.
Makes me feel like people are just.
Miserable like this is this is important.
To you really it makes me feel bad i.
Feel like if i could change one thing.
There were people to just be happier.
Because then people wouldn't get so.
Worked up over these insignificant.
Things all the time like people that.
Don't like last of us for example it's.
Like and and harassing the people that.
Made it i find it so baffling you start.
Going to be a co kamel and dis track.
Yes the thing is i don't want it to fall.
In the same meme as t-series where it.
Went too far even though i don't think.
That was my fault i just don't want to.
Fall in the same thing if anything the.
Only mistake i made was to not kind of.
End it sooner it's just for fun.
Literally a fun meme but i think it.
Could be a funny video so yeah well i.
Collaborate with mr. beast yeah i think.
We talked about doing something together.
At some point we do live very far away.
So we'll see do you have to clarify you.
Are joking every time you make an ng.
Joke clearly yeah i do people think.
Clearly take jokes out of context as.
Weapons against them so yeah i feel like.
I really have to it's super stupid but.
That's the world we live in it is what.
It is we need closet review okay i'll.
Film it it's coming up right now where's.
My closet are you guys impressed wow.
It's so dark this is not lit up there we.
Go.
It's ikea built it myself.
Designed it myself the layout on the.
Online ikea thing measured it yeah it's.
Pretty epic here or here underwear socks.
Always have the same brand of socks do.
Not have different brands of socks.
Biggest life hack of all time saving.
Underwear they're the same brand because.
Your junk and your feet needs to feel.
The same way every day never wear.
Different socks because otherwise they.
Get lost in laundry you're welcome.
Saved your life my pack isn't that.
Writing here oh sorry i got jesus.
T-shirt these are all my t-shirts that's.
It that's my closet i have no other.
Clothing except these pants and these.
Paints and that's all you need baby.
Closet tour done you're welcome do you.
Like golf as much as aadmi i actually do.
Play golf i played a ton as a kid i.
Think my handicap was like 17 which.
Isn't it's decent i have a really good.
Swing actually i'm pretty proud of it i.
Just like the focus my dad is really.
Good at golf we played last time he was.
Over in uk was really fun do you ever.
Consider.
Retiring from youtube i think i did more.
Last year but after my break it kind of.
Gave me some time to understand which.
Part of it i'll enjoy and that i just.
Want to focus on that it's crazy to.
Think how you entertained so many people.
On a daily basis but how do you imagine.
The long-term future of current youtube.
Are you planning on learning youtube.
Until you're very old or what do you.
Think you move on something new at some.
Point we have to think how many.
Youtubers now we now watch will be 50.
Sometime in the future bro well like i.
Said earlier i didn't expect to even be.
Making videos now so anything is a bonus.
I'll take you.
Yeah i remember a few years ago hearing.
Someone was 30 and did the youtube is.
Like what dude you're too old for this i.
Think it's changing youtube is changing.
It's gonna keep changing you never know.
What's gonna happen and that's part of.
The fun i think i can't answer this.
Question to be honest i think it's gonna.
Be similar to tv stars or tv or things.
Like that longer careers exist it's just.
How it is be honest are you actually.
Enjoying thinness and ferb or is.
Something that feels forced i enjoyed.
Them it's been really fun to watch them.
During the live streams if you can in.
Case you didn't know we watched one.
Episode at the end of each live stream.
It's not my favorite cartoon but i enjoy.
That you guys enjoyed so much i think i.
Prefer gumball more to be honest sorry.
Phineas and ferb fans if i had to watch.
A cartoon out i would probably watch a.
Gumball are you reading any interesting.
Books at the moment that you would like.
