If you don't know what stoicism is don't.
Worry i didn't used to have a clue.
Either even in my last philosophy video.
I said this i find it kind of humorous.
With the neverending self-help books.
That exists that still tries to answer.
This question today when it was answered.
Over 2,000 years ago by the ancient.
Greek word eudaimonia i was talking.
About happiness and what the best.
Practice to achieve it was the irony of.
My statement is that a lot of self-help.
Book today are based on stoic practices.
But i have been rebranded to fit the.
Modern world so even if you're not.
Familiar with stoicism there's still a.
Good chance that you practice it even.
Without knowing it for example things.
Like journaling meditating practice of.
Self-restraint are all in a way stoic.
Exercises even cognitive behavioral.
Therapy which some psychiatrists use to.
Treat their patients were developed out.
Of the ideas of stoicism the difference.
Is that cbt is used to help patients for.
The time they need it while stoicism.
Goes beyond and is more of a way of life.
So to explain what so is ism is can.
Sometimes be tricky because it's a wide.
Subject with many great practices and.
Many great philosophers so let's begin.
With its origins because to fully.
Understand and engage with ideas we need.
To understand where they came from i.
Think that was so cretaceous i love the.
Origin of stoicism its foundation comes.
From its own name which in latin is.
Stoah i like iris tatl in plato who had.
Their famous grandeur in schools stoah.
Meant simply a painted porch this is.
Where the first teaching of stoicism.
Were held stoicism derives directly from.
Cynicism if you watch my last video in.
Diogenes some sign up.
I find it mind-boggling that a man.
Living inside a barrel affects our life.
Still to this day and how we live so.
Weeks recognize just like cynicism that.
Virtue is the only good the main.
Difference here is that instead of.
Neglecting anything that isn't according.
To nature so it's recognized that some.
Things such as money for example are not.
Necessarily good or bad in themselves or.
They can be used for good or bad too for.
That matter plato and aristotle share.
This view as well and they don't count.
As stoics so let's just get into the.
Nuances there are many great stoics.
Epictetus being one of the most.
Recognized but there is no written.
Record of his practice but luckily for.
Us i think this is so cool.
He had a fan that wasn't just anybody.
But the roman emperor of that time.
Marcus aurelius.
Marcus frequently quotes epictetus in.
His famous written word meditation.
Epictetus describe what the fundamentals.
Of psoases amaze which is actually very.
Simple it goes like this there are.
Things in life you can't control and.
There are things that happen without our.
Control or beyond our control.
According to epictetus we should calmly.
Accept when things out of our control.
Happen but we as individuals can however.
Control our own actions through.
Self-discipline you probably done this.
Yourself at some point without the.
Self-discipline part when realizing that.
Something was out of your control.
Suddenly and abruptly what has.
Previously seemed terrible becomes.
Unimportant the idea of not letting.
Things out of your control change your.
Behavior is a simple practice that.
Anyone can immediately grasp but it's.
Much much harder to act upon achieving.
Virtue is not easy however the length.
The stoics went with this idea is often.
Heavily criticised misunderstood and.
Dismissed as being called an epithet 'ok.
Here's an example xenophobe when told.
About the death of his child responded.
Simply and calmly with i knew my son was.
Immortal you can take the extreme of.
This quote in any way you want but the.
Reality of the lesson is to simply not.
Fight against nature and let it consume.
You focus on what you can't control.
And let it be your virtue marcus.
Aurelius who is known as one of the five.
Good roman emperors did not live an easy.
Life he dealt with chronic pain and his.
Ruling as emperor would be fought.
Against to practice self-control every.
Morning marcus would meditate he would.
Meditate over all the bad horrible.
Things and people that would oppose him.
That day here's a quote from his.
Meditations when you wake up in the.
Morning tell yourself the people i deal.
With today will be meddling ungrateful.
Arrogant dishonest jealous and surly.
They are like this because they can't.
Tell good from evil but i have seen the.
Beauty of good and the ugliness of evil.
And have recognized that the wrongdoer.
Has a nature related to my own not of.
The same blood and birth but the same.
Mind and possessing a share of the.
Divine and so none of them can hurt me.
No one can implicate me in ugliness nor.
Can i feel angry at my relative or hate.
Him we were born to work together like.
Thief hands and eyes like the two rows.
Of teeth upper and lower to obstruct.
Each other is unnatural to feel anger at.
Someone to turn your back on him these.
Are unnatural.
Despite cbt deriving from stoicism as.
Previous.
Mention sources emit self doesn't talk.
Much about depression services some.
Focus rather more on anger they look at.
Anger as marcus describes as ugly and.
Irrational if you imagine an angry face.
It's rarely a pretty one however it's an.
Emotion that is often today displayed in.
Media when a character in a film for.
Example acts in revenge he's often seen.
Carrying at the same bad lead that was.
Originally done to him but we still.
Recognize his action as somewhat noble.
And satisfying we even enjoy seeing.
Anger if it's justified.
Marcus however received the word one day.
That his close friend in general ovidius.
Kasia's had betrayed him kasia's had.
Found out a rumor that marcus was close.
To death and possibly even dead.
And so casius took this as an.
Opportunity to declare himself as a new.
Caesar a betrayal of this magnitude.
Would enrage and upset anyone if it.
Happened to us but well marcus did.
Especially for the time being was.
Astounding he did nothing he didn't want.
To cause panic among his people if the.
Word got out of the betrayal and.
Confusing of ruling he instead acted.
Rationally without anger and without.
Hatred and made the announcement that he.
Will march against casius not to kill.
Him but to capture him when a friend.
Betrays us we have every right to get.
Angry but marcus controlled this anger.
Even mentioned that he hoped cassio's.
Would not kill himself in shame before.
His arrival for marcus coming would be a.
Great testimony of his virtue.
Marcus managed to not just calm himself.
But his people and while doing so he did.
What needed to be done which was to.
Secure the empire and he succeeded.
Plato long before him said that.
Philosophers should be kings.
This act of marcus was a true testimony.
To that statement a famous story quote.
Once said it is not possible to live.
Well today unless you treat it as your.
Last death is always near in stoicism.
Markers meditated heavily on this theme.
As well it might seem morbid but it.
Helps remind oneself to live in the.
Moment it helps you build virtue build.
Character and prepare yourself to be.
Ready to depart at any moment marcus.
Would meditate every evening to remind.
Himself to be grateful for every day to.
Me this is the most powerful part of.
Stoicism it's called memento mori.
Remember that you might have heard it.
Before i used to study a fair bit of.
Buddhism and what struck a chord in me.
Was the idea of reincarnation if you.
Live a virtuous life you will be.
Rewarded in the next but if there's no.
Reincarnation then you still live the.
Virtuous life marcus had the same.
Sentiment but for it way more eloquently.
Here's another quote from his.
Meditations live a good life if there.
Are gods and they are just then they.
Will not care how devout you have been.
But will welcome you based on the.
Virtues you have lived by if there are.
Gods.
But unjust then you should not want to.
Worship them if there are no gods then.
You will be gone but when i've lived a.
Noble life that will live on in the.
Memories of the loved ones just like.
Nietzsche said he was a why to live for.
Can bear almost any how if you have a.
Purpose you can live through any pain.
And suffering the purpose for the stoic.
Is virtue and it turns any pain on its.
Head that's what makes so isn't so.
Powerful and timeless that is still.
Practiced today memento mori.
Do not let it frighten you or remind you.
To live life with virtue memento mori.
By practicing so is ism there's no pain.
And suffering in this world that you.
Can't endure memento mori.
Nothing can be taken from you for a.
Stoic only values virtue memento mori.
Any suffering and pain will be an.
Opportunity for you to display and.
Practice your virtue memento mori by.
Living life to the fullest.
You are also ready to let go at any.
Moment to not meet death with fear or.
Anger or rather welcoming because some.
Things you just can't control will meant.
Amore remember that.
Music.
In a world where science knows no.
Boundaries travel to land where no tuber.
Has been and explore never-before-seen.
Landscapes.
They counter beings that are extinct.
Meet lion actors ancestors who collect.
Ancient items rediscover your favorite.
Scientifically accurate dinos what will.
You create.
You.
