That's pretty crazy.
I already have a wi-fi a wife i.
Oh yeah yeah boomers hate their wife.
More than anything i'm not there yet but.
I i think in a couple of years mm-hmm.

Time then your wife's box okay do.
Whatever the guy next to you always.
Looks in his pocket before he orders a.
Shot interesting.
Do you want another shot sure another.

Ordering each shot i have a picture of.
My wife in there and when she starts to.
Look good i go home i hate my wife my.
Wife's bad that's the title i said a.
Nice thing boomers hate their wives.
Where does that come from i feel like.

Like subcultures it's like the girls.
That i like wearing they have like the.
Hydro flask and they say and they say.
And i heard this yeah this goes like in.
Photo editing app it's become like a.
Subculture i've been seeing some words.
In my comments that i need to ask you.
All about so like visco girl.
I don't know that's the seo girl or.
Disco girl or schist kiss-kiss have no.
Idea what the hell that is.
And one there's one that says and i hope.
I got a feeling that somehow knows this.
Is a way inappropriate so you're.
Probably getting a really big food out.
Of this so let me know i don't get it.
Though i still don't understand what's.
Funny about it it's not funny it's just.
Like an actual subculture like i never.
Seen it is this normal white girls i.
Don't get it.
It is like a white girls that's what i.
Don't understand.
Explain it but i can't explain it man.
It's too complex i don't get it.
Oh is it like amber chamberlain is that.
It i think it's kind of image handling.
Yeah but i guess he did a video about.
She already done a video yeah no no no.
Nurse i said slip off his testicles.
Spectacles spectacle blonde with big.
Tits dumb yeah you can't be blonde and.
Attractive it and have any brain no this.
Is how that works now that's a boomer.
Sentiment yeah i swear people tried to.
Make me think that when i was a kid yeah.
Attractive people were automatically.
Suited or really buff people too right.
Yeah yeah this i wonder what boomer.
Values you still have it you don't.
Realize yeah yeah shaped by society.
I think burma's forget that washing.
Machines and dryers were invented during.
Their lifetime because all they cared.
About was making their own daily lives.
Easier it tries to washing using the.
Very latest technology a combination of.
Solar and wind power.
She says wasn't their thing we're like.
The the dishwasher was actually a really.
Important invention for the women to be.
Out of the kitchen yeah and here boomers.
Are like oh.
We're just wind oh you can wash your.
Dishes with your hands yeah yeah such.
Backward-thinking yes technology bad is.
Probably the worst boomer value yeah.
Although well we have all these taken.
Howl idea right but like is anyone.
Happier from it i was talking to someone.
About this the other day have you.
Thought about how much easier it's like.
Sleep around now because of like the.
Apps and stuff compared like only people.
Who were really i don't sleep around joe.
I know guys my tinder no but i just.
Thought about that how like that's gotta.
Have made it easier for people want to.
Do that i don't know that's like yeah.
You can argue it's a broom about you to.
Feel that's not a good thing to be like.
It's too easy to hook up now yeah i.
Think you had to be like good in like.
Club since oh yeah yeah and now you can.
Find someone on your same page yeah.
Easier yeah this one was born without an.
Umbilical cord it's because he's from.
The wireless generation the police just.
Pulled me over him and said papers i.
Said scissors i win and drove off i.
Think he wants a rematch.
He's been my english textbook is.
Terrible i'm hitting a nail i'm hitting.
It again i'm hitting it a third time.
Things would move much quicker if you.
Didn't tweet every nail feelings if we.
Do it every stroke he's tweeting he's.
Three thing to doing everyone all right.
Okay millennial dad's have terrible diy.
Skills half of them own don't own a.
Stepladder cordless drill half don't.
Have a cordless drill your dad oh you're.
Right when you were dad probably and.
You're never set of screwdrivers.
What bothers me yes again someone to do.
It i that's what i do was the time yeah.
So you'll be that millennial dad huh.
Proud millennial dad yeah i feel like.
It's so embarrassing though when you get.
Someone there and it's literally like.
Two seconds and it's done mm-hmm because.
You don't know like the basic thing to.
Do so i actually in my old flat i used.
To actually get a guy in to change the.
Light box so you're not a boomer at all.
I'm just old zoomer is like the thing is.
There was like a light over the stairs.
Oh yeah you don't own a step line but.
Then once it was there once he was there.
Like so where do kids learn to be so.
Violent and that one's real i mean like.
That's a real comic yeah it's so yeah.
That's like one of those boomer ideas.
That just seems too sick for some reason.
It's like it's been disproved like.
Scientifically so many times it just.
Doesn't seem to stick no yes like.
Violence did not exist before movies.
Yeah balances come down but kids are.
Playing video games so video games bad.
Video game bad like what's he has like a.
Bomb in the house i guess yeah what's.
Yeah i mean if yeah if you let your kid.
Have a bomb in the house or like.
Whatever them i got your rating to.
Answer why is he so ugly yeah the kid.
Looks like an a dog yeah it's got like.
Like this but i feel i gotta say i feel.
Like it's again it's equally cringy when.
Kids be like no but this is car video.
Games at all no i don't think it's asked.
When you when you've got science on your.
Side but yeah i still think it's cringy.
Like overtly trying oh yeah you do it.
Like really great i think it's just.
Cause buyers at oh you're all.
Scientifically wrong like who cares.
Could you see that like some stores.
Stopped selling like video games after.
Like a shooting and stuff okay yeah.
That's i think i think it when i read it.
It was when.
Trump said something and then everyone.
On twitter be like i've played video.
Games my whole life i never thought of.
Doing anything violence that's like yeah.
It's more like how you say it i guess.
Then yeah that's a good point yeah cuz.
Then you're putting yourself into it and.
Be like i'm so good i'm not bad at all.
This is so great you're right classical.
Music good modern bed.
Joe han you have to come with me to 2018.
