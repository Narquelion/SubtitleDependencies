Music.
How's it going bros my name is.
Last week we looked at what was it a.
Couple's guru.
Person reacting to me now i was.
Recommended this video.
Of a public speaker reacting to me and.
Now i will react to them.
Pewdiepie let's go.
My name is david jp phillips i'm a pub.
God damn it.
I've been doing it all wrong.
You know this guy's a public speaker.
Because he knows you need to do.
Something right away.
To get to grab interest mr beast is.
Really good at this.
What's up guys this is emo sixpence.
This is what i need to do apparently.
Just call out something.
This is the biggest tampering this world.
Has ever seen.
I'm trying to grow this tambourine to.
The moon.
From my pippy keep watching this video.
Alright sorry public speaker man.
Continue public speaker and i am here.
Am i detecting a little bit of a swedish.
Accent on this fellow man.
I think yes sir to give you loads of.
Ideas advice and knowledge on how to.
Become an even better presenter and.
Public speaker and we are learning from.
The best.
It is the absolute hero the best it.
Can't be me.
Mr pisa please the king of internet.
Pewdiepie we gotta ask this question.
Why is pewdiepie the king why is.
Pewdiepie the best why is he the legend.
Why has he got.
So many more views than anybody else.
He's not driving around a lamborghini.
He's not throwing money at people he's.
Just.
Him it's just i to be fair i don't throw.
Money at people.
I could do it i guess so that's a good.
Point and it's been like that for 10.
Years now i want to have a look at his.
First video.
And now have a look at that no no.
Laughter.
Yes he's still the same guy so this is.
Going to be exciting this is his first.
Video.
It's so weird i remember shooting that.
Video even.
I have a distinct memory of it i don't.
Like it pewdiepie here.
Yeah have you heard that one before.
Pewdiepie it started off with it kept it.
Going baby.
Keeps doing that he's been doing that.
For 10 years he's changing his voice.
Modulating it to a higher register.
Being that kind of playful guy i usually.
Take a break from all.
Electronics or whatever just because the.
Internet here is so did you see that.
Beautiful.
Double shoulder shrug.
He's so analytical i love it this is.
This is what i expected from the public.
Speaker what no public speaker.
Dating guy like he didn't analyze.
Anything it felt like.
No one appreciates my double shrug.
Shoulder.
That i've been i did that 10 years ago.
And i was like.
No one paid attention to it what the.
Hell man.
That is a very very unusual thing that.
Public speakers and presenters do.
And usually when they're synchronized.
That is associated to being truthful in.
What you're saying sometimes.
Really that's so interesting i had no.
Idea yes i am truthful.
One shoulder shrug it can be associated.
To not being entirely.
Truthful or honest about what you're.
Saying but obviously he.
Is double shoulder shrug or pewdiepie i.
Love it.
Laughter.
Music.
Pewdiepie self laughter did you hear it.
It's been going on for 10 years.
He is still doing it i can promise you.
We're gonna have a look at the new video.
In just a moment.
It's very very comfortable the beautiful.
Thing with a with a self laughter like.
That.
Is that it increases anticipation of.
What's going to come and you think.
Oh so that's what i've been doing.
He makes it seem so deliberate i don't.
Know.
I think that whatever is going to come.
Is more fun so he is actually.
Planting fun in that smile.
Whether you want it that makes sense.
Actually i.
Got a job a support captain he's got a.
Job uh so you can call me captain pewdie.
Smoke him up in pewter you see that.
What did i do now i did a little fake.
Pipe that's right.
Genius.
Laughter.
This guy oh my god i feel i feel so.
Flattered.
Embarrassed and epic at the same time.
Legendary prop and what's interesting.
With that is that.
This is him this is 10 years ago he is.
Not a public speaker he's not a.
Presenter.
But even the professional ones they.
Haven't got to this level where they're.
Using imaginary props maybe they're.
Using props like this they're showing.
Something on stage.
By using imaginary props.
It's not in their repertoire add that to.
Your repertoire.
It'll really enhance your public.
Speaking you can learn from me.
10 years ago public speakers to be fair.
Like i don't know if he's just uh.
Buttering me up here so now i'm like.
Yeah well actually.
But i do think that in the school i went.
To they.
Really hammered in on public speaking a.
Lot.
So i do think that helped a little bit.
Even though i look.
Back at this and i'm like dude this is.
So terrible.
Oh you can go there and they'll be like.
No i don't want to be there and i.
Believe you better    go.
Laughter.
Using roleplay as well he's gotten.
Better at this i think but using.
Different voices can i thank you.
Yes you're good now i'm going to go.
There you guys are going to go there now.
I'm going to go.
There and whenever you're in a public.
Speaking situation use role play like.
This with different kind of voices on.
Stage.
Oh it's amazing again it's a high level.
Public speaking skill.
Using gestures.
Music.
Okay let's have a look at the filler.
Sound thing um.
Why is he doing it it could be of two.
Reasons i.
Believe that he's not aware of that he's.
Doing it the cool thing with filler.
Sounds is that.
If they are functional i.e you want to.
For.
Some reason make it crystal clear that.
You're coming to a point or.
That you you want to signal that you're.
Nervous you want a signal that you're.
Uncertain you want to signal that you.
Are super present.
Then you can add a filler sound.
Functionally for that.
In all other circumstances just kill.
Them eradicate them.
Yeah i agree i i i find myself to want.
To editing out the.
Um sounds a lot of times because it is.
Annoying but i it's interesting how he.
Points out.
They actually do have a point they can.
Have a point which is kind of.
Yeah i never thought of that in your.
Signature scene.
Why does a man have a towel in the.
Background huh is that some public.
Speaking.
Trick what the it's got this very.
Deliberate background and a.
Towel oh oh that that's a public speaker.
Thing isn't it.
He'll come out and be like oh at the end.
Of the video i bet you wonder why i have.
A towel here.
Well you see they hate them.
Now i'm curious if that's gonna happen.
In your head but.
I want to keep uploading videos because.
I think it's a lot of fun and i'm gonna.
Miss you guys.
Just look at this as soon as he says.
I'll be missing you or he talks to us in.
One way or another he tilts his head.
Just slightly a couple of degrees to the.
Left.
We tend to do that when we want to show.
Empathy for something if your rabbit.
Died i'll go oh.
It's so funny i would never have thought.
Of that he makes you seem.
So smart for doing it when it's just a.
Natural human thing but he's like look.
What he's doing.
This is so great that's too sad why i.
Want to point this out this is because.
This guy.
Is synchronized what i mean with that is.
That there are.
Five levels of synchronicity in your.
Communication number one gestures number.
Two body language number three voice.
Number four.
Language and number one five facial.
Expressions if you.
Are i don't remember single one where.
Was the diagonal.
Five when saying something it increases.
The credibility of whatever you're.
Saying this guy is.
It's just a natural when it comes to.
Communication question is.
Is he still the same pewdiepie then.
As he is now.
Oh god go back to 10 years.
Ago please.
Welcome everyone to floor game flooring.
Flooring.
Floored and vlogging ah language change.
Again.
After nine seconds is doing exactly one.
Thing the same as he did.
Previously in 10 years ago it was.
Accident.
Just 10 times more obnoxious you're.
Welcome people like oh there's a.
Conspiracy.
He's doing it to promote black ops no.
I'm just an idiot.
Okay every conspiracy around me can be.
Summarized i'm an idiot.
Like i was gonna private right did you.
See that.
No i didn't what did i do i did the.
Double shoulder.
Yeah damn he's good again.
Ten years later and i bet we're gonna.
Hear a register.
Pitch up as well tootsie's back on the.
Line so i'm posting my setup.
God damn dude.
Did you hear that register increase.
This is pewdiepie for us the question.
Then does he still have that.
Synchronicity going.
Damn dude that's cooler than my setup.
That's not fair.
This is freaking brilliant you know that.
He's three times.
Displayed a sense of underdog or.
Displayed a sense of.
Weakness he did it now that's better.
Than my setup.
Yes that is better and all conspiracy.
Theories around me i am an.
Idiot admitting or showing a weakness.
Because i'm a beta i can't help it.
Look guys he's deliberately pretending.
He's an absolute loser.
Yes of course deliberately increases the.
Level of serotonin in the other person.
They they connect with you in a.
Different way.
That's right you're welcome for the.
Serotonin guys.
I'm so bad do you feel the serotonin.
Just.
Surging through your veins i don't know.
Where serotonin is.
Is it in your brain it's in your brain.
You feel it in your brain.
Just laying yourself out there showing.
That you are so much human that you can.
Admit your weaknesses like that.
That really connects us to him.
Maybe that's part of his magic spice my.
Magic formula.
We're a peaceful religion everyone will.
Join and anyone that doesn't will die.
Okay i'm not threatening but subscribe.
No.
Bell notification come on 11.
Boom boom boom did you remember that hey.
This is again imaginary props.
That's my reaction.
There is a skill called full out just.
Playing it full out.
Obviously spitting on yourself would be.
Defined as a full out.
Skill i feel like yeah damn uh first aid.
Kit you're welcome.
Saves life this is so beautiful.
Do you remember the video that he.
Recorded 10 years ago he had about 20 to.
Um filler sounds i would guess that.
Loads of those.
Were not consciously put there he is so.
Much more skilled he knows exactly what.
He's doing it's like you've gone to a.
Presentation space.
Communication skills coach because there.
Are it's almost like i've been doing it.
Every single day.
I think he's he's on point with the um.
Times.
That's something i found about very.
Annoying and deliberately trying to get.
Out of i probably still do it a ton.
Though and scythe cuts it out basically.
Very few instances when you can add a.
Filler sound and this.
Is one example of those so look at this.
He's using them.
It's live uh the wrench uh you're.
Welcome.
Saves life oh that's true just by effect.
Just by effect and they're perfectly.
Placed there i think we've nailed it.
Guys.
I think we've nailed it why you nasty.
Pewdiepie.
Such an absolute success one he is.
Super humble in more than five different.
Ways did he show weaknesses during this.
Four-minute analysis of this video.
Number two you're welcome for the.
Serotonin guys.
Two he's got is ready to changes number.
Three.
He's got all the variation spicing as i.
Call it.
Which he uses himself he's not just.
Using visual effects and sound effects.
He's using himself with different spicy.
Words changing language changing.
Voice he doesn't need anything more than.
A camera.
A microphone some video editing.
And he's got 100 that's right props to.
Cyber as well guys.
And i can just say this i.
Have been doing public speaking for so.
Long for 20 years i have still got.
So much to learn from now this is an.
Entirely new arena for me as well doing.
Reaction videos like this i hope you.
Like them i hope you love them.
But i've got loads to learn from him and.
I am here to learn it because.
I want to become as excellent as this.
Dude is.
At this profession and career wow.
Thumbs up to you mate no you're so nice.
Oh wow or terrible at water everywhere.
And ask me.
Why that person is so absolutely.
Excellent or.
Terrible at what they're doing i would.
Prefer excellent because i love learning.
From.
Great ex.
Shout out that was such a good video and.
Not.
Like even if you didn't bother me up i.
Still thought that was really.
Interesting actually hearing a pro and.
Noticing these things and pointing them.
Out.
That was so cool check out davidjp phil.
It's super fun.
I was thinking maybe i should do a video.
Reacting to my own public speakings that.
I've actually done i've done a couple.
Few throughout the years that might be.
Fun as well.
Do that next time i don't know that's it.
For me for now.
