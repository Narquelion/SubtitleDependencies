Do all millionaires think the same today.
We find out a millionaire.
I can answer finally we're doing a you.
Believe spectrum spectrum yes which.
Means i get to play along and you can.
Silently judge me how about that.
Self-made has to be somebody that was.
Growing up broke i disagree with that.
You can mow lawns for a few months and.
Make like a few thousand dollars we know.
How many lawns i'm gonna have tomorrow.
It's a lot of lawns once they say once.
Matalan lot of my limes.
That's right poor people you're not.
Mowing enough lawns i keep telling you.
Guys you gotta get mon lowing what are.
You doing.
Cringe sykes the key to my success is.
Just working hard like 18 to 20 hour.
Days every day of my life and having no.
Life but having a lot of money alright i.
Don't care who they are i'm sorry.
They're all six millionaires with.
Different values and beliefs i am.
Self-made hold up hold up hold up.
Strongly agree somewhat again okay i.
Would put myself i agree.
Music.
Okay so 72% agree growing up i didn't.
Need anyone in my family that was it was.
In real estate i didn't have anyone of.
My family that you know had millions of.
Dollars and for me i'd blame properties.
For something fifteen six years i.
Haven't twenty bucks.
And working part-time after school and.
Like saving away all that money then i.
Used that money to get my real estate.
License i barely graduated high school i.
Never went to college.
Two divorced parents so i should not.
Have become wealth that's right if your.
Parents divorce you got no chance i know.
He's just listing a couple things i get.
It but still that sounded kind of dumb.
Sure you can list things that would make.
It easier for you i don't know see.
Statistically what i believe that i put.
In them no one's the sickest no one.
Statistically is going to make it.
Statistically most people don't i.
Literally started from the bottom i'm.
Not saying that i was ever homeless or.
Anything but i did grow up in a.
Single-family house hold everyone's odds.
Are stacked against you shut up.
Administration my counselor told me i.
Would never make it in business so it's.
Self-pitying to go like i should not.
Have been successful guys.
Everything was against me i just had to.
Am i being crude maybe a little bit i.
Just generally think people becoming.
Rich is such a fluke that i don't that.
Doesn't mean they didn't work for it but.
It's so much luck involved in it so to.
Act it's like somewhat self-important or.
About it it just i don't know i feel.
Weird about it.
I'm somebody that was growing up broke.
In my opinion like you got it from the.
Bottom and i didn't get it from the.
Bottom i just grew that i don't think no.
I agree with her actually i totally.
Agree with a you need to come from.
Straight from the bottom like i started.
With a few thousand dollars i know a lot.
Of people who started i got a small loan.
Of a million dollars it was very tough.
For me what do you mean up thousand.
That's a ton like if you had nothing at.
That was a dollar so that's a huge.
Advantage are you kidding me yes yes it.
Matters like your life like you can't.
The zero but let's say you start with a.
Thousand dollars i still believe.
Yourself maybe even ten thousand even.
Twenty thousand because you're not truly.
Like a even six figures or seven figures.
I'm broke and i live at mom's house with.
Zero dollars you're in a way better you.
Can vote yes you are oh my god does he.
Not see it you can mold lines here at.
Every few months it makes like a few.
Thousand dollars like there's we know.
How many lawns i'm gonna have tomorrow.
It's a lot of lawns but that is.
Self-made the point was hot how much do.
You feel like you're self-made and if.
You start off with money given to you.
That's that's obviously an advantage i.
Would have been better off if i had.
Money in the beginning that would help.
Tremendously oh oh all right let's see.
Where i would put myself i would put.
Somewhat agree maybe it's a piss people.
Off i don't know i i just remember being.
It the the reason some ways is for a.
Short time it was a short time i was.
Very very poor and i was too proud to.
Ask my parents for money and i could.
Barely afford buying food i'm sure most.
People gone through this at some point.
In their life worth you can't really.
Afford food you just buy i remember just.
Buying pasta and just living that off.
For a month and i would eat it plain.
With some spices and that was.
Because i was all i could afford but it.
Wasn't a long time period in my life.
It's not like i grew up being poor or.
Whatever did they just they did they.
Just high five not being poor let me see.
That again.
Yeah not being poor gang man being poor.
And being broke i've been broke before.
Like me my husband i've been broke many.
Times in like our relationship but we've.
Never been poor and even like a long.
Time ago when i lived in a one-bedroom.
Apartment with my family we were never.
Poor i mean i was happy like i had.
Pudding we went to like parks and stuff.
I never felt poor damn she had pudding.
All i had was spaghetti you don't.
Understand my struggles well i got.
Kicked out and moved into my.
Grandparents garage and so i was poor.
Mentally and i was broke financially and.
I had to take care of myself at a very.
Young age so for a decade i was running.
A pool company in order to eventually.
Gain the opportunities to ultimately.
Move that ball down the court obviously.
So but were you happy i mean i wasn't.
What the hell why are you happy he said.
He was poor financially or mentally as.
Well like not really right because there.
Was a lot of stuff going on and like i'm.
Living in a garage and i'm growing up.
And i had to not only he didn't have.
Pudding i think that's the issue here no.
Pudding i had to bust my ass off to help.
My mom so for me i feel like we all.
Start from somewhere we go through.
Certain motions because it builds.
Character i like that i'm jealous of you.
Guys i wish i had that mindset like i.
Traveled to third world countries to.
Kind of this guy wish he could mow lawns.
That's really it i grew up really really.
Great but then i hit 20 and i moved out.
With some boy in the situation got very.
Very domestic violence you know i was.
Living in a penthouse and i'm sorry i.
Got too much pride i wasn't gonna go.
Back home and you know i'm like black.
And blue like getting locked in like.
Closets like really really toxic stuff.
So that for me was very very poor now.
Did it sling i mean that's obviously.
Awful but what does that have to do with.
Being poor i'm so confused shot me too.
Six-figure a month income.
Yes but in that state of mind and in.
That environment i felt like i was.
Really poor like i looked beat-up and my.
Direct deposit was not gonna fix a black.
Eye you know like oh no no oh god i.
Don't want to pay more taxes god damn i.
Look so red what is happening i need to.
Stop shooting so late at night what the.
Hell i look insane dude there must be.
Something going on here why is it so.
Dark there's no way there must be.
Something on my camera settings all.
Right guys this is how it looks night.
Now.
I'm sorry guys i'll get it fixed next.
Video oh thank god oh thank god i.
Thought i would be the only ones oh no.
Like you know you make more money you.
Obviously do have to pay somewhat more.
No feel like we deserve extra things to.
Pay just because we have more money like.
We shouldn't be looked to as like a fun.
You know from the government or someone.
Else who just feels like oh you have.
More money you should pay more in taxes.
I just feel like it should be a little.
Bit more freedom with it cuz it's really.
Really stressful and i feel like a lot.
Of businesses fail in the first three.
Years because a tax is not because.
They're bad at business not because.
They're about it managing money but.
Because they're not prepared to do.
Everything by the book true true i don't.
Mind paying taxes.
Obviously obviously i just wish i knew.
Where they were going big companies who.
Sell a lot of their services like in the.
Us and then they have some like ireland.
Tax status where they're getting out of.
It like apple and amazon and these big.
Companies that theoretically should pay.
Billions in taxes while it's us average.
People who are really supporting the.
Government i think there should be a.
Little aboriginal people and they are.
Average average men british people.
Millionaire i see what he's trying to.
Say though cuz everyone likes to pick on.
Millionaires and be like more taxes when.
In reality these huge companies are.
Avoiding so much but they.
Supplying jobs they are supplying a.
Service i don't know.
Amazon paid zero dollars in taxes didn't.
Didn't amazon save that because they cut.
On on the on bosses they got a tax break.
Or something like that i don't know.
Enough about these things.
I just know people like to throw out.
Lines for that knowing the new ones just.
Like i just stayed you donated $690,000.
Yeah he makes an average of 200 million.
Dollars per day yeah i put out a whole.
Press release and i'm just like come on.
Dude haha give a little donation shaming.
Donation shaming you're not donating it.
Up i see your net worth online you have.
To donate more me donate.
No i'm not gonna donate you need to.
Donate more to be fair they have created.
A lot of jobs through people i actually.
Sell on amazon so through amazon fba.
He's provided an opportunity for people.
Like me to make a living for myself to.
Be able to start a business you know.
Online and to be able to make internet.
Money so like to have that freedom and.
Like whether we think that he needs to.
Give more or not i mean that's really up.
To him what he does with his money i.
Would put disagree i think the most.
Expensive thing i own is my car and.
That's just like 60,000 just 60,000.
Listen to me i guess i own properties i.
Just don't like having things it makes.
Me feel overwhelmed i'm just like no.
Stop no more thank you i realize how.
Spoiler i sound but if you were in my.
Shoes you would understand is really.
Tough getting free stuff all the time my.
Husband my husband is like 90 grand car.
And added like a 200 grand car i'm like.
Why did you do that like you don't need.
You don't need to he's like well i mean.
I could so why not like i don't want to.
Pay more in taxes but i don't have to.
Pay buy more cars but i just did i just.
Do.
I don't want to pay more taxes i mean i.
Grew up wanting cars like i my whole.
Bedroom was like plastered with cars on.
The wall and then when i could actually.
Buy it it was like it's so fine right i.
Was fulfilling a childhood dream it.
Wasn't even about the car it was the.
Challenge yes i had all the cars the.
Thrill was gone so i mean it hey look at.
That he understands he's learning money.
Just bites you materialistic goods they.
Just either satisfies a craving or a.
Momentarily spark of joy that will fade.
True happiness we think oh no i think.
That you should all have like dreams and.
Chase those dreams whatever they are.
Maybe they don't cost that much but i.
Mean not everything's materialistic like.
When i started making money yeah i.
Changed my body yeah i know i mean.
I wouldn't cleared my skin yeah i.
Wouldn't got a tattoo what i would not.
Like you know what i mean like yeah.
Don't get hair extensions like i've.
Definitely purchased things in the past.
That were cool and it was because i.
Could but as times gone along for me.
I've realized so many times that every.
Time i hit the goal or the destination.
Of the target i realized that the.
Journey was so much more fun and and as.
I've achieved more success and built.
More companies it's almost every time.
Now where i get there and i'm like man.
The journey was actually funner than the.
Destination yeah right.
Yeah cause like yeah but the question.
Was if you've spent an absurd amount of.
Money just because you can not me mm-hmm.
I used to buy a lot of bags i'm like no.
I like and then once i got there it was.
Kind of like i don't have a man i don't.
Kids what am i doing.
But the question wasn't like what do you.
Think about what's not don't make me.
Agree with you mr. ted talks if you do.
What do you think about material.
Possessions now like true but in the.
Past i've had that so i fulfilled my.
Childhood dreams now i'm good these are.
The same questions that's before oh yes.
Not in person.
I don't know i think i've i think a lot.
Of times it just makes me sad for other.
People that the point i'm about to make.
Is that people look at me and they're.
Like oh he doesn't have any problems.
Because he has money people jet so many.
People share the idea that if money.
Solves all your problems and i know i.
Talk about this a lot and every time.
Everyone gets mad at me i just feel bad.
For people that i have bad mindset.
Because i know for a fact it isn't true.
Stop thinking money solves all your.
Problems because it just doesn't it.
Doesn't sometimes i look back on the pad.
Times when i was just starting off.
Youtube and i was just making enough to.
Pay my rent.
Each month and that's the kind of time i.
Look look at almost back as the most.
Happiest when me and my dad were in.
Sweden we we didn't have a lot of money.
It wasn't like easy but we were equally.
Happy then the amount of fame and.
Success that i got it was it has been a.
Huge package and obviously you know.
Money.
I just i prefer to have it obviously but.
Okay we got some split 93% agree live in.
A world where social media is extremely.
Prevalent so like being on youtuber or.
Instagram or social media a lot of it's.
Like perceived you know you are.
Constantly getting like quote-unquote.
Judged but even on social media it.
Really just depends what you post if.
That's very much just to control them.
Just for social media like i an even if.
You ask me what time it is i check my.
Iphone i don't even know if this thing.
Works but like when you're trying to.
Grow your business especially for me.
Like in stock trading why do you get.
Into stock trading is it fun no it sucks.
But you can make money so for social.
Media and you kind of have to show it.
But even with social media i mean if you.
Have a million subscribers on youtube i.
Think you're rich yeah because i know.
Youtube is writing you a check.
Oh so you judge people know something's.
Keeping your lights on now i'm not.
Judging in a bad way of course you know.
I i work every day to try to make videos.
Too but in the same sense like we judge.
People that ask us for money let's see.
The normie filter all normies will say.
Yes here's the thing obviously money can.
Buy happiness you can buy you things.
That you like it can buy you good health.
You can buy a lot of things obviously.
Obvious.
I'm just saying true happiness comes.
From here i strongly believe that.
It's kind of like that poor broker.
Mentality it's like you trick yourself.
To think that you're happy you trick.
Yourself that you want these things so.
That's why they say yes i guarantee it.
All over again like if you're rich and.
You're like in a domestic violence.
Relationship we all love the idea then.
And it's even what i touched on before.
We like everyone loves the idea that.
Only if you know only if i was rich then.
All my promises it's like a fantasy that.
People like to play with it's like the.
Lottery huh you can buy that idea.
Literally that's what that is you buy.
The mindset oh ah what would i do with.
This money you know oh all these things.
And you have statistics and actual.
Studies showing that people that win the.
Lottery end up more miserable because.
Their whole life got changed and in a.
Lot of ways my life got changed.
Completely due to youtube and not i.
Would say always positive like you're.
Not happy even though you might have.
Money but still money can buy fun things.
And looking back like you're proud of.
Your accomplishments you're proud of the.
Journey that you took to get to where.
You are and in a way it can pass money.
Allows you to buy freedom and then.
Freedom gets you the ability to have.
More time to find what makes you happy.
It's not a direct result but it could be.
Like let's say your mom or your dad or.
Somebody that had a severe illness you.
Know was in the hospital and they had x.
Amount of time to live now this person.
Makes you extremely happy and it's gonna.
Cost a million dollars or two million.
Dollars for this surgery that they save.
Them to survive and you save them like.
You quite literally just bought.
Happiness now that's not to say that it.
Buys happiness in every area of life.
Like i can but in certain areas like.
Yeah money definitely can buy a my most.
Fulfilling asset is the house that i.
Bought my parents since i am so grateful.
To be able to you were serving another.
Person hundred percent exactly happy.
Here's what this guy is gonna say we all.
Find that i guess reason at different.
Points in our life so i'm i don't care.
You're boring seriously i don't hear the.
Same people telling us so annoying what.
Did she say i i didn't not a single word.
And it really just depends on your.
Definition of happiness what makes you.
Happy and we all find that i guess no no.
No there's no your definition of.
Happiness that is not exist these in at.
Different points in our life some people.
Figure it out really early on and some.
People it takes them all a lifetime to.
Find out what's what makes them happy so.
Even though you could have a lot of.
Money if you don't know guys if you want.
To be rich subscribe and become floor.
Gang today it that's how it works.
Instantly i gotta say though people that.
Aren't rich they love to sell their idea.
Kind of what i touched on before it's.
Like the lottery let's sell this idea.
That you can become rich too when in.
Reality a lot of it just comes down to.
To pure luck and it did for me.
Especially with timing i think that's.
Probably my most humbling thing is that.
We know what if i started youtube now.
Would have been some as successful no i.
Don't think so obviously you still have.
To put in the hours and i think a lot of.
People judge people that are successful.
Too and basically looking at them back.
Oh if i put up the same amount of hours.
To work i would do it too and that's not.
Really the case either but right rich.
People love to sell this idea to people.
Too so they can feel like they have some.
Sort of control over their life like.
Okay you know there's so many.
Autobiographies of rich people or or.
Online programs you know the jake paul.
Program you can be rich too right if i.
Wake up every morning and if i meditate.
And if i could do a jog and if i have.
These same routine as these successful.
People have then it will happen to you.
Too as well but it's just selling the.
Idea that you're in control of your.
Destiny when unfortunately you're not.
The thing is if you're happy then you.
Don't need to be rich and being rich.
Will not make you happy something to.
