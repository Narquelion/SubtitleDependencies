To meet.
The love of his life who lives in the.
Amazon rainforest.
In brazil men packed five military.
Grade boxes to go there and his mom.
I don't know where gave him her hair.
Very normal.
She actually just uh snuck out and gave.
Me a little bit of her hair from her.
Comb.
To take with her why it means a lot.
They can't communicate properly with.
Each other so they use this app.
Go on my father said.

Swimming up his urethra that he did not.
Just wear two layers on his pee pee.
He also wear this pair of pants all.
Right.
He's wearing pants that outfit what else.
Happened oh yeah.
Paul admitted that he was uh he had a.
Criminal record and before uh.
Letting her react to it he runs off in.
The jungle what is happening.
It's just very confusing and i wanted to.
Follow up on some of these clips that's.
Why i summarized it.
The first thing i want to follow up on.
Is the.
Before the flight the whole military bag.
Thing.
So apparently he he changed his flight.
Because uh.
They wouldn't let him grab his five bags.
Brazil.
All right uh it's five for uh brazil two.
Bags older.
Huh that's two that pay for three more.
Two bags only.
Paul actually just need two bags the.
Other three is his mom's.
Hair they're packed with it brazil yeah.

Had a set list of things she wanted for.
The baby and that was my responsibility.
To bring back.

Plus 35 years of my life here in the.
United states into five pieces of.
Luggage.
Is that everything out of there looks.
Like it ah.
My only option is just change the flight.
Just wait 30 more days.
This way in 30 more days and come back.
With everything it's not a terrible.
Option.
Hey sweetie how are you hi you're fine.
No she speaks english now.
Trouble how about that all the luggage.
They said i can't bring oh no they can't.
I can't bring the luggage.
I'm not lying i'm posting on a plane.

So there you have it check it out.
Pewdiepie.store.
See you guys next time so okay back.
To the future paul is in brazil.
Again and he calls his mom for some.
Advice um.
I really need to talk to her i'd feel.
Alone overwhelmed right now.
I don't know what to do he looks a lot.
Better he's got a haircut.
How are you i'm good i hope things are.
Getting better there.
Why is the mom so oh.
I'm good i think that why why is that.
Funny.
I don't know i don't know i can't.
Explain it's too complex i was really.
Upset the other night when you were.
Messaged.
Because you were in such distress yeah.
It's been stressful had everything going.
On.
It was really nerve-wracking for me.
Because i'm we're so far away.
There's nothing i can do and there was.
Nothing i could do to help so i didn't.
Call it though karine's mom's been.
Talking a lot about how she wants uh.
I see divorce she said that basically.
She feels that everything ever said was.
A lie.
She regrets the the marriage and she.
Just wants me in korea and get divorced.
She wants a divorce unbelievable.
When you were messaging you were upset.
Too yeah it's upsetting.
You know everything's upsetting you know.
You you know what i think i think you.
And kareem need to talk yourselves.
And really think about what you're doing.
And then this is uh this is like.
Paul's default pose look in the.
Thumbnail.
Just oh god you don't understand how.
Tough it is to be me man.
I gotta have people protection i gotta.
Have all kinds of.
She didn't want to talk she's like.
Pulling teeth together to talk.
I mean you've been married since what.
You know you met dad when you were a.
Teenager and you've been married since.
You were high school sweetheart so i.
Mean.
You've been making it work for years we.
Had a very hard first.
Couple of years but we worked it out you.
Need to talk to each other.
And if you can't work it out you need to.
Come home.
Because this can't happen again and.
Again and again.
I don't want to tell you what to do but.
I think you know that's nice.
One thing that brings me difficult it's.
Too many differences.
Way too many differences so in your.
Honest opinion do you think me and.
Koreans should stay together or you.
Think we should get divorced.
I think you should make up that decision.
Your own girl god damn adult what the.
Dude and she clearly thinks you should.
Break up because god damn me.
When we talked last time i said it's too.
Soon don't do it you need to learn about.
You know each other and everything i.
Already told you that.
What's without everyone getting rushed.
To get married everyone.
Everyone i gotta get married now why.
Aren't you married yet.
You gotta figure out if you work first.
I swear she looks different every time i.
See her karine wants the divorce.
I'm so shocked i can't believe kareem.
What's the difference.
How do they get married to begin with.
Uh.
Please sit down and explain to me all.
The reasons why you're upset.
Is it wearing a body is that a.
Bulletproof.
Bed no that can't be it i'm not even.
Married to paul and i want to divorce.
From him why does he have a bulletproof.
Vest.
We can't wait to see what paul has been.
Wearing during the pandemic.
You're determined not to talk to my.
Know.
You know oh oh you know.
That's the one you should know you.
Should already.
Know i'm sorry if i offended your family.
And your culture.
I would like to really work through this.
He's been willing to offer a bit of his.
Mom's hair in a bag.
I think that's pretty generous of paul i.
Think karine should access.
You saw that karine did not accept just.
Accept.
Paul's mom's hair and look how.
Devastated that was for paul.
Will they ever be able to recover from.
This i don't know.
It does not work we've talked before i.
Do not want to talk anymore.
You want divorce yes 4k divorce.
Bala.
Oh god it gets so heavy with these.
Couples.
Just get divorced i don't care god oh.
Yeah so i don't know how i don't know.
When but.
For some reason despite all they go.
Through.
They have a baby.
Can you imagine like you're so close to.
A divorce.
You're fighting constantly let's.
Have a baby okay.
I still have doubts but i think it's.
Important that the baby have you around.
And your love also.
And your attention i want to keep this.
Together.
Because i love you.
They've been.
Get ready for this emotional roller.
Coaster oh god what am i watching just.
Thinking no.
I can't watch this i don't want to hear.
About what happened.
Wrong with someone's bad bad that's too.
Much man i can't do it.
This seems extremely private and.
Sensitive i don't know how.
No the morals of showing this i agree i.
Don't i.
I don't even feel comfortable looking at.
It i'm like no i don't see that.
All right so switch forward to today.
2020 what's going on with paul and.
Carini.
Let's watch are they still together it.
Looks like.
Oh and look they had a baby that's great.
How you doing oh.
What do we have here a little boy yes oh.
You're so pretty.
Thank you so are they in america or.
Brazil.
I honestly can't tell essentially.
This is one of my redos yourself nice.
The uh gentleman lived here.
A little bit of a fixer upper as we say.
Probably 20 years.
Until he got really ill and his sister.
Put him in a nursing home.
Be careful and watch your step okay.
Needs a lot of work.
Holy crap whoa these are sold as.
Is yeah i don't know anything about the.
Plumbing.
Or any of that wow we got a toilet in.
Here okay.
Got twelve but i'd want a wall when you.
Want a wall toilet low privacy oh.
Yeah is there there's no air.
Conditioning here is there uh i don't.
Think.
I don't think there's air conditioning.
In there paul oh my god no i'm doing the.
Paul.
Face i mean i feel for people that don't.
Have options but oh my god.
She left the slums just to get to.
Another slum.
There's no air conditioning there's no.
Walsh ball she definitely should have.
Stayed in brazil.
Oh my god this gives you some.
Perspective right everyone's like third.
World country there's third world.
Country that you go to america this is.
American dream right here so it's just.
Like comfortable for you okay.
What yeah yeah how can you ask that how.
Would you be.
Yeah mama's not happy you wanna keep.
Walking.
Okay come on sweetheart you'll like this.
Thank you not bad.
Be careful.
This is how they get you right they show.
You an absolute dump in there.
Then they show you something like not.
The nicest in completely.
Like slightly better or it looks amazing.
In comparison.
Um this one's got all the whoa it's got.
Like.
This place got walls oh    yeah i mean.
Yeah it's just like a regular bathroom.
What would this    this.
Place got a bathroom off yeah i mean.
Smaller we had to in brazil we'd have to.
Keep it oh this guy's got a.
Window neat and tidy and everything.
Organized.
Excuse me it is.
I prefer my house in brazil over this oh.
So the lot ran is how much 500.
Okay we can't afford a whole lot with.
Our savings 500 bucks to rent that.
Where no.
No dude that's this is this is doable.
Well think it over uh give me a call.
I'll see you all later we'll definitely.
Be in touch.
Okay they need to fix rent man.
Are you serious rent does not make sense.
To me it's like another form of tax.
It's in some way or another where the.
Rich people who sits on property just.
Cash in money right that doesn't seem.
Right of me this isn't ideal but it's.
What we can afford until i can make some.
Money get something better.
So what do you think about it you know.
Good yes you're no good husband.
Yes you're no good husband america.
See everyone has this american dream.
It's so good here welcome to america i'm.
Sorry americans you're great obviously.
But 500 for that.
That's an option why shut up.
Bruh i mean i'd be disappointed too i.
Don't know if it's paul's fault.
Necessarily.
This is the last video this is the last.
Follow-up of paul and karine.
While i was in brazil i boarded my dogs.
At a training facility.
It really feels great to finally have my.
Dogs back did you have a big thing away.
I didn't even know you had dogs.
We looked a few places to live and.
Korean hater i didn't even know you.
Could leave dogs at a training facility.
That'd be great edgar.
Uh you're going on a vacation man but.
Someone moved out of this old house in.
The same trailer park so i decided to.
Get it before somebody else got it.
Our house that's kind of cute.
This is basically a studio home.
Everything is just one big room.
And it's really small hmm.
Yeah maybe if you build a loft or but i.
Think it's definitely the best.
Affordable option that greeny.
Will accept okay how hard can this be.
My man got ac installed oh that looks.
Beautiful well done.
Oh god please oh god oh.
Paul that's not exactly the same thing.
Right you just pull the thing out and go.
Right in the window.
Oh god this gave me so much anxiety oh.
God people do this.
Oh what if i walk underneath a building.
And some idiot paul guy.
Installed his own ac oh god i to have.
God.
This should not be legal i know he's not.
High up but still.
Oh there's a moldy stinky biscuit hey.
You can.
Clean that out to make sure satisfy here.
Oh.
That's nasty build a little loft.
Build a little maybe outside extra thing.
Make the bed uh go flip inside the wall.
Yeah it could work it could work there.
You go paul and kareem.
Saga a lot of twists and turns man.
I don't know it started so with the hair.
And.
Uh and so much the process.
Uh yeah i'm glad yeah proper habitable.
Place.
Considering previous options i would say.
Happy ending question mark i hope so.
Maybe that's it maybe that's the.
American way of you get married really.
Early.
And then you just forced to go through.
The hurdle.
And then after that i'm sure they're.
Gonna make it paul and karine.
I'm sure they will make a sign of.
Approval.
That's it thank you for watching see you.
