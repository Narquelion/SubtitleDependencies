Hey joe you may think i'm a loser in.
Real life but in the gaming world.
You're the loser god i'm good good night.
Okay for those who don't know joe rogan.
Is.
A podcast host i think it's one of the.
It's probably the most popular podcast.
Host i think at least.
And uh i mean i don't know how you even.
Have a podcast in 2020 without pissing.
Someone off every week.
Uh and today i guess he pissed off the.
Gaming community this time.
You pissed off the wrong crowd mr joe.
How dare you how dare you criticize.
Video games.
So what did joe rogan say well let's.
Check it out.
You know and then they they seek refuge.
In drugs or video games or.
Something that stimulates them and video.
Games are a real problem.
They're real problems you know why.
Because they're.
Fun yeah well i have a real problem with.
Them.
And you you you do them and they're real.
Exciting but you don't get anywhere.
Right.
It's like you could do like like martial.
Arts right you could learn jiu jitsu.
You get obsessed by jiu jitsu and then.
Three years later.
You're you're like an elite jiu jitsu.
Athlete you're like you're.
What kind of beta martial arts take.
Three years to become an elite.
They're you're entering in competitions.
You're a purple belt you're moving up.
Yeah you're doing well.
You're thinking like i might be able to.
Open my own school one day that.
Confidence yeah if i have a hundred.
Students and those hundred students are.
Paying me x amount of dollars per month.
It's almost like if you have like a.
Stream or something like that.
With like a hundred viewers and they.
Like pay you x dollars.
Why are you talking about jiu jitsu man.
Hey man you have heard about.
I've been doing it wrong gaming money.
Get the    out of here.
I'm all about that jiu jitsu brain i'm.
I'm quitting youtube right now.
I could be making jiu jitsu money this.
Whole time and no one told me there was.
Jujitsu money laying around everywhere.
Make a living holy    i can have a.
This would be amazing and then you see.
Your jiu jitsu.
School and your jiu jitsu instructor has.
All these students and drives a mercedes.
And he's got a nice fan.
I could have a mercedes jiu-jitsu.
Mercedes god    damn it.
Good damn it i've been sold a pipe dream.
That isn't real.
I make no money you're doing something.
Exciting and fun and you don't.
Or you could just be then you just say.
That gaming is too fun uh.
Just seeing a bit of correlating message.
Here joe.
Video games three years later.
You could be that same kid.
Just playing video games waiting for the.
Next vic's whatever the    game is.
You know next xbox game to come out and.
You're going to waste your time.
You have children you got to waste your.
Time playing video games.
Jiu jitsu not a waste of time i mean i i.
Get what he's saying though at least.
With jiu jitsu you.
You're building your body you're.
Building your muscles you're learning a.
Skill that you're going to have for life.
Instead of a video game.
That comes out you know there's always a.
New cycle of games even if you get good.
At one.
There's always going to be a new one i.
Guess is my point uh so i get it i get.
His point it's just like the worst.
Example ever with jiu jitsu.
And that's another thing like you.
Wouldn't even have to be good.
At gaming to make a living obviously.
Right.
There's compared gaming competitive as a.
As a.
Superior job it's like the worst example.
You can make.
You can make analytical content reviews.
Streaming.
Youtube esports managing i like all.
These so much aspects of gaming.
And it's such a massive market.
Developing whatever you understand what.
I'm saying.
Uh i'm curious what ninja said let's.
Check out what ninja said and i guess.
That's the thing like.
Who gives joe rogan has to say about.
Video games like.
No one cares that's like what i would.
Think about.
I know i know everything about.
Everything so it's hard to think of an.
Example.
Makeup that's like me saying make up.
Stupid you cannot make money make a.
Doesn't happen but i think it's the fact.
That everyone is talking about this.
That makes it so interesting and it hits.
Comment about wasting time it's almost.
Like.
Joe rogan accidentally brought up the.
Discussion of what is the meaning of.
Life.
Building a career for yourself or you're.
Making money and.
Building something out of yourself or.
Just having fun in the moment and.
Enjoying yourself and.
That's almost how it became such a big.
Deal uh let's see what.
Mr ninja said most recent.
Uh clip going on about joe rogan his.
Comment about video games.
Or like gamers and i think where he was.
Coming from.
Um or what he was talking about.
Specifically i don't want to put words.
In his mouth but i watch the whole thing.
And try to get context of it and watch.
You know.
I don't want to say it just say you hate.
Him ninja.
Just say gate uh i will put merch in his.
Mouth because uh.
I want to be invited to his podcast in.
The future but i think maybe like what.
He meant was like that uh.
I think i watched the whole clip and.
Like uh i don't think he meant anything.
Bad.
To the podcast joe rogan let's talk.
About games.
I love you babe before and after the.
Clip that was just.
You know being posted on twitter it.
Sounds like he's talking about like the.
Top one percent like the very odd.
Or one-off chance that you're gonna be a.
Professional player any sports player.
And a successful one at that.
Right i mean you can be a professional.
Esports player and you know beyond like.
A tier two tier three.
Or which is not maybe paying you the.
Most and obviously if you're not winning.
And being paid a lot you're and you're.
Not a big streamer then you're not.
Really making a lot of money.
Uh so i'm assuming he's just basically.
Talking about you know the top one.
Percent you're winning every tournament.
You're on the top point.
Oh my gosh all right great correct.
Response.
Uh so yeah there was a.
Twitter bad but yeah i saw a bunch of.
Comments as well quit gaming eight.
Months ago bought a new car.
I have an amazing new girlfriend i make.
It load of money.
And i'm buying a house this spring i.
Party.
Every weekend i'm never home i enjoy.
Laughing.
Do yourself a favor stop trying to make.
A gaming career it's crazy as.
And of course we have the contrast.
Here quit my job four months ago.
Bought a car got out of an unhealthy.
Relationship i make more money now.
Playing video games.
I also use my platform to bring.
Awareness to mental health and bipolar.
Life it's great.
Do yourself a favor stop being.
Close-minded it's creatures.
I wasted my time playing video games as.
A kid to such a degree that i wanted to.
Know how to make them.
I wasted time learning some coding art.
Sound and music and now been wasting my.
Life for nearly 30 years writing music.
For them and companies waste lots of.
Money paying me for it.
Epic yeah i even though i kind of memed.
It already i feel like it'd be so easy.
For me to.
Come at joe rogan's statement and be.
Like yeah joe you're.
An idiot i make money playing video.
Games what the    you talk about you.
Dumb.
How can you be so stupid it really just.
Sounds like a boomer.
I'm sure when i when i'm old and i'll.
Have my podcast and i'll just go.
Yeah these    kids man back in my.
Day.
We play real games now these kids are.
Playing vr smear.
Real men back in my day we play fortnite.
God dammit.
We play battle royales bet they don't.
Even know what that means.
This is such a generational gap that's.
Always existed.
Even with novels i'm sure people said.
Like oh.
People wasting their time reading books.
Huh you should be go out there in the.
Real world enjoy the real world.
Cringe it's just a thing that's always.
Been going on and it's always going to.
Keep happening.
But i also find yeah i do find it kind.
Of cringe with all the streamers.
Being going after joe being like well i.
Make a living he's so stupid.
It feels kind of irresponsible almost to.
Just say say that because it's.
I love the idea that i can just inspire.
My audience or.
I don't know people in general if they.
Want to pursue youtube and other.
Gaming related things like yeah go for.
It but i don't want to.
Sell people on the pipe dream that is.
Possible for everyone because it isn't.
Just like any sport or uh profession.
You have to be in that one top percent.
Or 0.1 or whatever.
The percentage may be to really be.
Successful at it and it just doesn't.
Happen to everyone.
And that's just that's just reality of.
Life does that mean you shouldn't pursue.
Your dreams no but.
I think it's important to have some.
Perspective of your.
What you're pursuing at least and i.
Think especially when you're talking.
About something that.
Is actually like what joe was saying.
Highly addictive.
Like the video games are dopamine hits.
And having kids being so.
Exposed to them for hours and hours i.
Can't.
Honestly say that i think that's.
Necessarily a good thing either i it.
Kind of worries me as well a little bit.
When we designed something to be.
Addicted and.
Even myself as a kid i was probably i.
Yeah looking back i was definitely.
Actually addicted to video games.
And i think a lot of kids are.
I think it's way more common that people.
Think so even though there's a ton of.
Benefits to video games like i read.
Studies saying that it helps with.
Logical thinking.
Like puzzle solving i guess that's.
Logical thinking reaction time if you.
Think that's important.
Yeah it can improve your memory you can.
Meet friends online.
It can help you get out of mental health.
Situations there's a ton of.
Positive benefits but i think that.
Doesn't.
Make gaming above criticism it seems.
Like the gaming community is so.
Sensitive to criticism like.
Just acknowledging that gaming addiction.
Is a thing and that it is a problem.
Which i think is what joe is trying to.
Get at he's just.
He just brought up a terrible example at.
Least i think.
Uh yeah invite me to your podcast joe i.
Love you come on.
This is what it really meant guys it.
Doesn't diminish all the good.
You can talk about both it's okay.
Uh you know if gaming is your only hobby.
I would invite you to.
Try something else it's fun that's the.
Fun thing about life it's like what we.
Talked about in the beginning.
Is life about pursuing uh trying to.
Build something big for yourself or just.
Enjoying yourself and i think personally.
The answer is just a balance of both to.
Me the idea of.
Going through life being perfect just.
Feeling comfortable.
And feeling happy in the moment being.
Entertained is terrifying.
I hate that idea i never want to live.
Life just like that.
But also uh living life when i look at.
People that are.
All about optimizing and trying to be as.
Effective as possible and.
And accomplish as much as possible that.
Makes me really disgusted as well i i.
Think there's just a middle ground.
I feel like i i am though becoming more.
Boomer across the years like.
I a a few years ago as you guys know i.
Got into reading a lot more and.
Laughter.
I god i'm such such a boomer this is.
Like comparing that hobby.
Which is something you kind of have to.
Force yourself a little bit to get into.
If you're not used to it to something.
Compared to video games.
I mean obviously it's different for.
Everyone and everyone gets different.
Things out of different hobbies but i.
I can't honestly say i get that much out.
Of video games.
Compared to reading a book that i feel.
Like oh i learned something i actually.
Got something out of this even if it's.
Fiction i can still oh.
Cool i could immerse myself in in a.
Character i guess you can do that in.
Games but i don't think games are that.
Good at it.
I don't think they are i can't remember.
Last time i played a game and be like oh.
I learned something.
Maybe i'm wrong maybe there are examples.
But it just doesn't happen as often.
As what i'm saying i guess what i'm.
Saying is find a balance by all means.
Enjoy video games it's a great hobby.
It's super fun.
It's fun to share with other people and.
That's what made my job possible and i.
Couldn't be happier about it but also.
Find a balance.
I think that's what makes life fun doing.
Different things.
I don't know i just thought this whole.
Uh discussion is so interesting and i'm.
Curious what you guys think anyway.
Passing on the question to you guys.
And that's it for poppy somaria today.
And remember.
Keep gaming gamers children.
Of nine parts.
It's time to raise what was once.
Forgotten.
What creatures fart spells and poop.
Troops awaits.
Hoopty is coming to.
Nintendo switch.
And remember it has a very big pp.
Pre-order promotions i mean.
