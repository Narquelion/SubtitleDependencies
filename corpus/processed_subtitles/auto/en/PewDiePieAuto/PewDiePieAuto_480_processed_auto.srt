Figure out if we could live in japan or.
Not so we met with visa people and we.
Met with tax people but it's just so so.
So difficult that we feel a little.
Overwhelmed by it we knew it was gonna.
Be difficult obviously but there's a lot.
Of things to factor in with not just us.
And the dogs and the time and the.
Housing it's just a big step that i.
Don't know if you're ready to take or.
Not i feel like.
I really want to do it though i feel.
Like i don't want to look back in a.
Couple years and be like oh i wonder.
What it was like i wonder what it would.
Have been like and i think i mean the.
Unique opportunity to do something like.
This and i really want to try it even.
Though a lot of people you know.
Obviously it will be difficult so i feel.
A bit sad i don't know because we.
Don't know what to do basically i made.
