Numerous surgeries can't feel his face.
All to look like his k-pop idol gym and.
He wants to look like gym it oh oh you.
Know i'm not gonna lie i had the kpop.
Bug bite me too.
But i think you know there's a limit.
There's a limit to everything.
Oh my god alright let's watch this my.
Life's not to revolve around kpop and i.
Want my entire lip to look like jimmy.
And the lead singer would be jessica's.
For me he's perfection i just kind of.
Wanna i mean he's not wrong if you gotta.
Pick anyone to look like jim and that's.
Not a bad pic at least maybe fewer.
Korean at least i don't.
Oh god i don't want to be mean but it's.
Gonna be hard about my entire look to.
Look like jimmy he's gonna say my my.
K-pop idol oh no.
Jimin from bts is his k-pop idol he's.
Like a 12 year old teenage girl trapped.
In an.
Old man's body that's what this is.
Because that's what they would do right.
Bts debuted in 2013 now is actually i'm.
Getting bart baker vibes from this and.
What this is alt universe bait marker.
The korean version bart baker this is.
His current hostile environment let's.
Plan for the replicator you know you can.
Have your own hairstyle right gym and.
Change hairstyle i have to change it too.
Because i don't know i want to be here.
But i was ever questioned he liked to.
Wear this okay pop stars of us what he.
Wants to be him but he also have a crush.
On him what is that how does that work.
It's getting creepier as we go these are.
Some of my shoes that these ones they're.
Very very very striking especially with.
The spikes though the k-pop stars wear.
This particular brand as well now these.
Ones were expensive one where he has oh.
My god 5700 790 this one was my most.
Expensive clothing item over 7000 this.
How do they always afford this this is.
Why some people needs to be poor okay no.
Offense poor chi minh actually wore this.
In the fake love video so i'm super.
Obsessed to wear it all the time it's so.
Yeah this is very special to me because.
Obviously jimin wore the same one so i'm.
Gonna go on a limb here and say this man.
Is obsessed with jimin if any one of you.
Ever do this on me i will shoot.
You i will shoot you in the face i don't.
Have guns but i'll figure it it out in.
The kpop stars have so much pressure on.
Them before they even become famous they.
Have to train for four years they lived.
Together we have to train eight hours a.
Day it's all manufactured the way they.
Look the way they perform they all look.
Incredibly perfect yeah that's the whole.
Thing right it's all manufactured they.
All do surgery in korea it's all just.
Companies producing these stars like out.
Of a treadmill and you want to.
Appropriate that when i actually watch.
Their videos i cry just because they're.
So beautiful.
That's definitely normal you guys have a.
Crime watching my videos that's okay.
Though one is actually an original photo.
I'm trying to think how long ago this.
Was maybe like see he looks fine.
You look fine you don't have to look.
Like jermaine you don't have to look.
Like jermaine you look better there i'll.
Say it you look way better there gives.
The thing with plastic surgery it's like.
Yeah i understand you have some part of.
You that you maybe want to change but.
You look like plastic surgery it's not.
Like a natural look you look like.
Surgery happen to your face and i don't.
Understand how that is helping anyone.
I had very bad acne when i was at school.
And i had a very last time i checked you.
Don't need surgery for acne where's all.
The acne then me my nose is very big.
It's horrible i can't it's very hard to.
Look at it i don't even recognize the.
Person they come i just don't even seem.
To relate to this person it's weird.
I had all of the fatty tissue removed.
I was gonna be in a british girl cousin.
But i would like to look as close as.
Possible to koreans like korean pop.
Stars and jimin he wants to look as.
Closely as possible to korea.
He's like my version of like in japan i.
Don't know this could be me guys he.
Undergoes a surgery and then he's.
Supposed to meet up with his friends and.
They judge it afterwards and this is.
Where it gets real cringe so what do you.
Guys think of the new look then it's.
Obviously very different like what do.
You think the eyes are it is taking me a.
Little bit of time to adjust to actually.
Because yes do you know it still made.
You feel like it's still me or do i look.
More like jimin i don't ever want to.
Picture you like this i know starting to.
Be on it oh my god you're upset a little.
Bit because you're upset oh yeah i like.
You just don't want you to get to a.
Point where you can't undo anything i.
Mean well i think we crossed that.
Threshold heaven we looking at how we.
Used to like no i'm not gonna get.
Addicted i don't think i've done that.
Much you know.
What how do you think no he's is he you.
Know i don't think it's an addiction i.
Just think it's a i have a strong.
Interest in pursuing my my gold they.
Don't have anyone doing this early it's.
A very common thing in their career you.
Know really oh yeah they do i heard.
About this they do the puffs underneath.
The eyes actually that's very popular i.
Think i think that's the surgery.
You did why do i know that yeah it's a.
Trend because it's it's the thing in.
Korea it is a point like it's weird for.
Finally think of a good equivalent that.
Doesn't sound too racist so i'm just not.
Gonna say it but it is weird.
That's why that's not my goal i want to.
Look korean.
Jimmy jimmy i wanted to get a lateral.
Canthoplasty with it's cutting me.
Incisions here and kind of cutting the.
Skin out and then it's already planning.
To make the eyes more of an almond shape.
So i don't want to look like her he.
Wants to make the eyes more of an almond.
Shape you basically want like the.
Typical korean eyes imagine leafy coming.
Back.
He's got chin implants it looks exactly.
Like the chad meme he's got the haircut.
He's got the big nose he's got the.
Muscles that would be amazing i'm not.
Addicted.
I just want to pursue perfection so now.
A year later ollie has not 100% reached.
His goal yet he's not addicted okay stop.
It he's doing a couple more surgeries.
Gangnam style i know that reference it's.
Like that song where he already looks so.
Different geez form into a kpop star.
It's gonna be very painful not actually.
Changing my race cultural appreciation.
But you are changing to look exactly.
Like a korean person and that's what you.
Said in the last video i'm not changing.
My race i'm just trying to look exactly.
Like another race not cultural.
Appropriation control appreciation i.
Like it.
I'm not gonna see my new face they're.
Gonna see these are new friends these.
Are different friends if you're one of.
Those that goes through a cycle of new.
Friends every year or what's happening.
Or he has more than two friends maybe.
That's it i can't really today oh god i.
Just be amazing and their body and i.
Feel for them in a way so now that i'm.
Done korea i'm really trying to find.
Djimon i'm going to all of his favorite.
Hangouts favorite places i love you army.
Army and wonder what the bts stands.
Think about this guy is there the most.
Insane people on the planet it's a very.
Not everyone not everyone somewhere the.
Mine i think that's a pretty fair.
Amen and they would have grow very harsh.
On him so i was able to release the kpop.
Music video which i never dreamed would.
Happen before on my dream and hopefully.
Meeting jim in the most important reason.
That i'm in korea is obviously for my.
Beautiful transformation which i'm about.
To undergo he's doing another surgery.
Guys the first five hundred didn't do.
The trick but he's not addicted did they.
Have to him in flavor.
My flavor it's italian though isn't it.
Look at that and also reducing my.
Cheekbone i'm having a bone shades down.
Too late west so he's explained to his.
Friend what the surgery procedure is and.
I really love this big way it's coming.
All that in symmetrical i know it's.
Gonna be painful baby i know but it's an.
Amazing hospital amazing medical team.
And it's worth it you know if a person.
That clearly has done a lot of surgery.
Already looks at you when you tell them.
About your surgery that way and maybe.
That should be an indicator that maybe.
You're doing a couple too many of the.
Surgeries that's just my opinion.
Korean people love me every memorial.
It didn't every memory doesn't.
Understand what the    you say but.
There's always that oh look at those.
Chinon planes machining planes it's to.
Make it stick out more jesus.
Why am i holding this i am finally back.
In london so it's now being two months.
Since my surgery jesus christ he's a.
Potato damn you swell up a life thanks.
For that picture alright so now it's.
Time to reel for the frames the friends.
It's nene.
Music.
No no his name.
Oh thanks lucien i've got something to.
Tell you guys you might not take it well.
Music.
He had a face behind it what did he know.
I'm so confused i know i can't tell the.
Difference am i crazy i can't tell the.
Difference.
He looks from plastic surgery to plastic.
Surgery before okay holy go tell your.
Mom yes please you know it makes me.
Happy like look i look 18 now so i can.
Hide my real age so okay sure we'll go.
With 18 check the whole kind he thinks.
He looks 18 i can't actually remember my.
Age i'm almost done just need to do my.
Eyes and alive are left i'm not michael.
Jackson i'm jimmy i'm not michael.
Jackson i'm jimmy no i'm not not going.
That way i'm ollie.
Ah you're only i'm not mike jackson i'm.
Jimmy and i'm jim in your ollie.
Oh molly yeah that's right whatever it's.
Convenient and i'm sure jim in will know.
Me by now he must know me did you get me.
Oh god i'm one of our jim and actually.
Thinks i was i have a quick question.
About your ring though are you married.
No i'm not actually but this is jimin.
Just to remind me jim in every day so i.
Can feel germans energy and stuff what.
Do you like about jimmy well jimin has.
The most beautiful smile the most.
Beautiful lips and the most beautiful.
Sweet eyes he's incredibly funny because.
He's always forgetting his bags that's.
Always a funny quality of someone my.
Favorite stand-up comedians always.
Forgets their banks.
That's hilarious there's probably some.
K-pop in joke that i don't know about.
I'm sorry oh i'm sorry to keep up stands.
Watching this video we're actually at.
The exact.
Same restaurant that semen and bts.
Frequently came to enjoy meals what they.
Eat.
Bts eat what oh my god.
Is that the holy sanctuary of bts they.
Probably just came there n8y filming in.
The background this is where jim in.
Shock he's sitting on the scene to say.
It yeah his butt has touched when he.
Eats but she's talking like this is the.
Church and she's a priest and an jimin.
Is gone that's how this sounds like this.
Is my dream so i i shake your hand and i.
Touch do you mean for you it's oh my god.
The church of bts it would surprise me.
Ok methey oh some dreams just maybe you.
Shouldn't pursue actually i don't i.
Don't want to just oh my god that food.
Looks amazing oh my god.
Okay to wrap this up the reason i find.
Out about this cuz he recently went on.
Dr. phil it's pretty funny i'm not gonna.
Lie there's some funny clips in there.
But it's more or less what we just saw.
Only it seems like a decent guy as a.
Person he doesn't seem i've seen way.
Worse people in dr. phil put it that way.
But you know he says in his videos from.
What i gather he's doing this to be.
Happy right so there's nothing wrong.
With then i'm doing what makes me happy.
I'm following my dreams and then he has.
A song that is i am perfection that's.
His song that's the lyrics of a song i.
Think let me show take a look at me.
Flawless is me i'm more than just pretty.
Great great lyrics and then he goes on.
Dr. phil and he says you know dr. phil.
Is like you feel like you need to be.
Someone else and he he confirms it say i.
Never feel good enough he isn't happy.
With himself and that's the problem with.
This you're never gonna be happy trying.
To pursue someone that you're not i.
Think it's totally fine if you want to.
Learn or take from other people some.
Bits that you'd like but just blatantly.
Being what is that stupid expression i.
Hate expressions but it is i be yourself.
Because no one in the world can be.
Better at it than you or something like.
That i know it yeah it's stupid and.
Cheesy i like this comment as well to be.
Honest he doesn't even look korean in.
The slightest he looks like a.
Middle-aged english woman who had.
Plastic surgery.
He doesn't even pronounce jimin red.
Cringe he doesn't even know how to.
Pronounce jimin it seemed to me watching.
That interview that hey at least he.
Knows he has a problem but he still.
Feels good doing the surgery so that's.
His way to cope i feel like if he didn't.
He wasn't addicted to this it would have.
Been addicted to something else and i.
Feel for him i'm not gonna lie i feel.
Bad that he's gone to undergone all of.
This because i doubt he's actually.
Happier that way than if he was before.
Maybe he likes to tell himself that he.
Is it's an interesting story and.
Nevertheless that's it for this video if.
You guys enjoyed it smash like subscribe.
