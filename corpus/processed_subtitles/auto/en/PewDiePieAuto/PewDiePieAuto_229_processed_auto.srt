Everyone dayton oopsie good evening.
Everyone i'm tammy my name is mary hamm.
And i like ham our first story comes.
From gloria borger gloria borger has.
Passed away now i'm not supposed to give.
My opinion but this is so sad papi.
Gloria was found dead in her apartment.
We don't know yet who is responsible but.
We do know that i was the last person.
Seen with papa gloria alive let's have a.
Moment of silence for papa gloria next.
News.
Our next story follows youtube youtube.
Tyranny see what no way that can be.
Right.
What did youtube do this time they gave.
A shout-out to ss sniper world ok not.
That big of a deal this is the future.
Sniper wolf is here to share some of the.
Craziest vending machines all around the.
World.
Pewdiepie had this to say oh i didn't.
Show up cuz i oh youtube's main some.
People were upset about this saying that.
This channel plagiarizes click big.
Articles like buzzfeed every day without.
Citing a source promote channels that do.
Research and write their own material.
Please now to be fair this is not on so.
Sniper wolf this is more on youtube i.
Mean i can't really fault anyone for.
Making low quality content except ham.
News i do research goddamn e and i'm not.
Upset at sniper wolf ok i don't even.
Care that she got to meet keanu reeves.
It doesn't really bother me at all.
Remarking and it doesn't even bother me.
That she's been on the trending page two.
Days in a row i don't even have any.
Opinions so it would be literally.
Impossible for me to care next news we.
Have an update on the tpu versus face.
Drama now this is the hottest drama that.
Has ever dropped the t foo is suing face.
Claim oh my god.
Honestly why did anyone care now t foo.
Said release the contract please.
But faze clan please release the.
Contract and then phase client be like.
Oh we are releasing the contract and.
Then fake-face plan b like okay we're.
Not gonna actually release the contract.
We're just gonna make a video multiple.
Different versions of contracts whoa.
Careful there buddy you're showing a bit.
Too much information.
Wow thanks for releasing the contract.
Now we can go through all of it this is.
Great thank you.
Careful not to show too much just put.
The contract out there they're crazy.
2018 oh my god there's so much.
Information we didn't know if he wanted.
More monthly salary we sent him a deal.
That was gonna pay him seven figures a.
Year why do they always do that they.
Always take seven figures it's in 1.
Million whenever someone says seven.
Figures that means a million it doesn't.
Mean anything else seven figure oh a.
Million so they address the allegations.
That face is taking money out of the.
Code t few stuff which apparently is a.
Lot of money into the fortnight purchase.
Code thingamajigger we've seen a little.
Miscommunication in terms of community.
Understanding about in-game items and.
What that might mean and what that apply.
To let us be very on the record right.
Now that has nothing to do with support.
Of creator coach t p was signed in april.
Of 2018 while epic announcement.
Supporter created in october of 2018 so.
They're basically saying it was.
Impossible for us to take money out of.
It because you know they would have had.
It in their deal if this contract.
Happened after they announced this.
Support a creator program you know you.
Know damn well they would put something.
In there but they're saying that they.
Wouldn't do that.
I.
I kind of doubt on that when it became.
Clear to us that his puran i've never.
Seen more private texts in my entire.
Life than these past three weeks every.
One is just aa private text i will put.
That in a video when it became clear to.
Us that his pure intention was really.
Just to leave that's very difficult.
So they address the criticism that face.
Been getting because t p obviously wants.
Out of this contract why can't you just.
Let them him and they say this oh why.
Didn't you just let him out we are fans.
Much more of a debt than that because.
Our fans have invested their time and.
Their effort and their care and their.
Love into the relationship that we.
Created with t foo to kind of argument.
Is that it's for the fans guys they're.
Just looking out for the fans so they.
Want to preserve this relationship that.
They have between the fans and face.
Klein and teague but teague clearly.
Wants nothing to do with favs claim so.
What kind of relationship are you.
Preserving there am i am i am i cavemen.
Dummy dumb i don't get it what's the.
Argument and for us to just drop him.
Solely because he wanted out i don't.
Think anybody can rationally claimed it.
That would have sat well with our fan.
Base or frankly the culture of hit.
Gaming and relationships in general if.
We were to just drop him the culture and.
The relationship of gaming in general if.
They drop him would be hurt what the.
Are you talking about that culture.
Is ruined because you didn't want to let.
Him out tv who said that i want to make.
It clear that i tried multiple times for.
Multiple months to get out of this.
Contract no one was blindsided by.
There's no one this relationship is.
Publicly broken how do you apply this.
Argument it doesn't make any sense i get.
It from a business standpoint and i.
Totally get that they want to.
Renegotiate with tv you to keep him.
Signed that's obviously better for face.
And they i understand that they built.
This relationship that they need to keep.
Intact the contract actually did leak.
And i showed it in my life's video.
Because brad put it in but i hadn't.
Actually seen it so i didn't get a.
Chance to react to it because it.
Happened as the video went up and the.
Split was between phase and tipu 80% in.
Favor of phase plan between brand deals.
And then brand deals brought in by by t.
Few so he wasn't exclusive but if he.
Brings in the.
Randal he still has to pay them 50%.
Okay appearance fees 50% okay well i'm.
Just not gonna do any tournaments or.
Like public places then and tournaments.
They take 20% damn what a great deal wow.
I don't understand what if you want to.
Get out of this contract.
Now the cherry on the cake here is that.
If he wants to leave or it gets out of.
The contract.
Gamers shall be prohibited from playing.
Video games publicly online or in live.
Tournaments or professionally for a.
Period of six months i don't understand.
Why t few wants out of this contract it.
Makes no sense at all.
What the frick a lot of frick's i don't.
Get it at the end of the day t for you.
Is a dummy dumb dumb for signing this.
Contract and face klein is a dummy dumb.
Dumb for having this contract to begin.
With it's a weird situation where i can.
Understand both sides.
I understand t few from not wanting to.
Renegotiate when you're already in a bad.
Situation.
But it also sounds like face gave good.
Deals to t few and good as a way to.
Compromise from this situation i think.
It is interesting that t few spoke up.
I'm curious if other people will as well.
Other people maybe are stuck in these.
Similar contract cuz otherwise i don't.
Think we'll hear anything about this.
Anymore because now both parties that.
Kind of said there's until there's some.
Legal development and whatever that's.
Gonna be it's gonna be hit hard i think.
Unless they settle outside a court t few.
Has now changed his fades klan logo.
Threw spongebob squidward.
That's not squid or that's patrick idiot.
Next news rest in peace social blade.
Youtube just famous social blade.
Everyone youtube announced that they're.
Changing the site to round out the.
Subscriber numbers it will no longer.
Show the specific number of each.
Subscriber it will round it up currently.
All craters with over thousand.
Subscribers get their subscriber cone.
Displayed differently in different.
Places on youtube and for the sake of.
Consistency they are changing this so.
Youtube for example on their channel.
Says 15 point blah blah blah.
It will now just say 7.20.
Instead of four thousand three hundred.
Four point three and depending on how.
High subscriber count you have or how.
Low subscriber count it will round it.
Out differently so if you have low.
Subscribers it will it won't just show.
Nothing or whatever and this goes up.
Until a thousand and i think that's a.
Reasonable number at least to round it.
Off off but people were very unhappy.
With this saying this is just annoying.
I'd rather see the number go physically.
Up lul nobody once states i have a great.
Idea youtube listen to your creators.
This also means the end of these flare.
Tv like live streams with the subscriber.
Counts going up and down because that.
Will no longer function then youtube.
Will no longer give that information and.
That was confirmed on twitter as well i.
Think there's a couple things to note.
Here when youtube said consistency i.
Thought they meant initially like other.
Websites have consistently like that.
Like twitter shows the same way they.
Round up there's the numbers and same.
With instagram they round up the numbers.
So i thought our consistency across the.
Internet but it no its consistency.
Across their website but i think most.
People understand that this isn't just.
Because of that it's also to end these.
Sort of live subscriber count' drama.
Battle dwarfs or whatever you want to.
Call it we just clearly become a.
Phenomenon that's a word and of itself.
That maybe i had a little bit part of.
Having something to do with maybe just a.
Little i think especially after this.
Tati versus james situation where james.
Trotter literally lost millions of.
Subscribers largely due to these live.
Streams that went on die showed the.
Subscriber camp it got it so popular and.
And then i mean at the end of the day.
James charles pretty much came out on.
Top but he still lost so many.
Subscribers from it which i don't think.
He has recuperated yet so it's.
Interesting regardless what youtube.
Decided to do by this and and i don't.
Know it's rich for me to talk about this.
Because obviously i benefited from this.
But i don't see this is that bad of a.
Thing i think in general people are.
Misplaced with youtube and they want a.
Positive change i think youtube.
Desperately needs a positive change for.
The website something that people will.
Go wow that's some cool.
I like that because right now it makes.
It impossible for you to to announce.
Anything that isn't positive like fixing.
The sub count system gaining fixing the.
Fixing this copyright system.
Nobody youtube's changing something that.
No one wanted basically brah.
Next news what forty thousand videos.
Tell us about the trending time this.
Youtube recalled coffee break made a.
Video exposing the trending tab i'm.
Trying to understand what does youtube.
Want from from us aspirated a clip from.
The show the view that has 10,000 views.
Is not trending but it's number three.
Trend that's when you start to think oh.
This is real i want to show you a clip.
From the trending tab and as you can see.
All of the videos don't seem to be made.
By creative bra now youtube has.
Responded on this already susan in her.
Promises for 2019 i don't know if that's.
What it's called.
I did say that at least half the videos.
In trending will come from youtubers so.
They are already implementing changes.
For the training tab to benefit creators.
Which they've been largely criticized.
For but i think what this video really.
Showed really well in this study that.
Coffee break did it's just visualizing.
How it is right now so basically they.
Took data from 40,000 videos but data.
40,000 entries a lot of my reason for.
Doing this is i want to answer the.
Age-old question is youtube biased.
Towards traditional media i mean yes i.
Think generally youtubers has been seen.
As something unsafe you know you can't.
Rest assured that every youtuber isn't.
Gonna be consistent with what they put.
Out there in terms of sparking.
Controversy and i think maybe i am a.
Testimony to that and generally.
Traditional media is a lot more safe.
Than that and that's why they're biased.
Towards it i mean i think that's.
Basically it but regardless them getting.
On training how many views they needed.
To get on trending and then we have so.
The way the graph works is that it shows.
Average views before trending and number.
Of training videos lele pons she seems.
To have trended about ten times on the.
Training tab and she it took her about.
Four million views on average to get on.
Trending go.
10 times ok so that's how to read this.
So what do we find who do we find with a.
Lot of times on trending the answer is.
Overwhelmingly traditional media.
Traditional media as in espn as you can.
Show jimmy fallon jimmy kimmel stephen.
Colbert netflix mba a cnn box brunt.
Almost all late-night or like.
Traditional meat like the most.
Mainstream of mainstream media is who we.
See over represented on trending over.
And over and over again.
And i want to stress this is not due to.
The fact they're getting more views than.
These other youtubers right because then.
They would be up here for example if.
Logan paul's barrier to trending is.
About 11 million views then no matter.
How much he uploads he's a lot less.
Likely to trend frequently didn't.
Someone like espn who's barrier to.
Trending is on average about five.
Hundred thousand views eighty four brah.
You know i always thought of the.
Threshold theory of like okay well could.
Logan paul gets consistently high of you.
So you shouldn't need that much he would.
Have to actually get a lot higher abuse.
To trend but eighty four something else.
Caught my eye.
Pewdiepie i know that guy his training.
Data is super interesting because he.
Trends all over the world yet he barely.
Trends in the us now here's where i tell.
You that we don't just have the us data.
Set we have all these other countries.
Too and when you look at those countries.
Pewdiepie is crushing it everywhere.
Except the us even in non-english.
Algorithm it's bizarre though you got.
Now youtube is mentioned for some time.
That they have human moderators perhaps.
He gets blocked most of the time perhaps.
Maybe but how do you test that i decided.
To look at other controversial creators.
Too i don't think you need to test it he.
Then compares the stats with canada.
Because it's similar this is because.
Canada is operating in the same time.
Zones they have similar cultural.
Interests and they also speak english.
Now all of these controversial creators.
Are extremely popular and have some.
Level of swearing or edginess to them.
And this is what i found on the us side.
Many of these creators aren't trending.
At all or if they.
Are trending it's once or twice and.
That's it for comparison here's the.
Canadian side oh 45 that means 45 times.
Someone at youtube went pewdiepie get.
Him out of here.
Pewdiepie get him out of here pewdiepie.
Get get him out of here oh my god that's.
Amazing what else do we got the only.
Thing that makes up for it is maybe the.
Idea that america had moderation at this.
Point and maybe just maybe now he points.
Out the hypocrisy of the fact that a lot.
Of traditional media is actually very.
Edgy i moved on her like a venom cook.
But i couldn't get there that's clearly.
Not what it's about it's not about.
Edginess is what youtube deems save.
Content at least i haven't tested that.
Theory but i wonder how 44 of my videos.
Like what were those videos that were.
Deemed unsafe if that was the case.
Rename it sponsor tab there problem.
Solved just delete the trending tab.
Please i'm sick of hearing about it.
What's the point it's just making people.
Pissed off like either make it.
Completely fair then again they they.
Have to the thing is if youtube doesn't.
Censor the training tab there will be.
Articles written about how youtube is.
Showing on this front page of youtube.
These bad content you know this is more.
Media attacks coming to youtube if that.
Was the case how long is this video i.
Didn't realize it's gonna be this.
Goddamn long i have so much more to.
Cover here on po news keep watching but.
We have one more news i'm sorry whoever.
Has to edit this video it's god awfully.
Long but chaos i just got cancelled and.
I need to put that in the title because.
That's gonna bring more people in they.
Gk's eyes brother six minute video.
Called by where he calls out ksi his own.
Brother so apparently this is a concept.
Now where someone exposes someone that.
They are close to in a 40-plus minute.
Video showing a private texts and making.
The other person lose subscribers i mean.
Ksi is losing.
Subscribers now now they ge frame says.
He he doesn't want this to happen and.
He's just trying to stand up for himself.
Apparently a lot of people see him as.
The bad guy and this is him showing i'm.
Not actually the bad guy and i don't.
Even try and follow the dead guk side.
Drama that's been going on with all the.
Disk tracks and bla bla bla i never seen.
Dad yes the bad guy so i'm not sure.
Exactly who he's addressing here.
Probably ksi fanboys which mine probably.
Won't be changed regardless of this.
Video also let's not forget about the.
Dark place they made a new o's in a dark.
Place it just put me in a dark place.
Dark place in a very very dark place why.
Do all these people go to the range.
Without my permission.
It's old video to me just seems like a.
Little brother not being feeling.
Recognized by his brother i couldn't.
Explain cuz i have done nothing but.
Support my brother.
Everything i've supported him with his.
Music.
Jd addresses a lot of the drama that's.
Been gone on between them behind the.
Scenes of the diss track talking about.
How he was actually hurt by a lot of.
Things that went down and talking about.
The drama that happened between.
Christmas apparently there was something.
That happened and he wasn't actually the.
Bad guy i cannot be bothered to get into.
It i am don't care about the research i.
Give up okay it seems to me like haze i.
Maybe isn't the most compassionate.
Brother and a lot of history haver he's.
Kind of put towards isis panther and.
They g maybe is a little more sensitive.
Than your average person it's just the.
Bits of banter please digi this is just.
Blunt but it also seems like a lot of.
Stuff went too far between them but here.
We are private stuff in the public eye.
Very fun very interesting now it did.
Seem like this video actually swayed a.
Lot of people's opinion i used to.
Dislike you watching this video is.
Relatable i misjudged you without.
Knowing your backstory i wish you the.
Best day jean it sort of became.
Overwhelming support for jd in this.
Video i guess now we can expect a 45.
Minute video from ksi addressing this.
Whole thing and another more back and.
Forth with private matter.
That i don't even know i also feel like.
This whole thing they already have a lot.
Of drama in the public eye so i can't.
Really be too critical about this whole.
Concept but it's just like god damn it's.
Another one it hasn't even been a week.
Has it it's under the last one jesus.
Christ that's it for this week's pew.
