This huge milestone of 100 million let's.
Get in with a video nine years ago i.
Uploaded my first video onto youtube.
This is what that video look like it.
Blew up.
I got millions of views and i was big.
Ride away.
No instead of twelve million views this.
Video had about three or four this is.
What my content actually looked like.
Back in that day and i am back with.
Black ops with an awesome game of search.
And destroy it wasn't good it wasn't.
Engaging it wasn't even original but i.
Loved it it took so when he uploads just.
For me to hit even a hundred subscribers.
And hitting a hundred subscribers was.
Huge huge for me.
And yeah today we're gonna celebrate cuz.
I have 100 subscribers oh my it's funny.
Looking back to that video and what i.
Said i obviously had big goals.
I liked aim even that big goals even.
Though they might not be relevant at all.
But no no i don't want to i don't want.
To be famous but at that time i was 20.
Years old i was living in sweden in a.
Small flight i had just moved away from.
Home i have no idea what i was doing i.
Just knew i enjoyed it i was also.
Studying at university at the time.
Industrial economics and management my.
Calling in life thanks to what i want to.
Do so i decided this youtube hobby i'll.
Probably have to set aside because i.
Should probably focus on my finals so i.
Upload a video saying i was going on a.
Break but in reality that was i was.
Quitting it was it for me just can't but.
My hobby and from.
That right now so i'm sure a lot of you.
I'm sure most of you will understand.
That and i'm gonna miss you guys a lot.
Actually which was a pretty reasonable.
Choice to make considering i had about.
Five people that actually watched me.
During this time but luckily the break.
Didn't last long just a few days later i.
Was back uploading videos again i had.
Found what i was actually passionate.
About and i wasn't ready to just let it.
Go.
I knew that a career in youtube was so.
Far away it was more of a myth than a.
Dream at this point because people.
Didn't even know if it was possible but.
It was always at the back of my mind.
That there was a tiny chance that this.
Could actually happen i was back.
Uploading videos and i tried out this.
New horror game that had just come out.
Called amnesia and it was scarier than.
Anything that it didn't even compare and.
The top comment of this video really.
Says it it it is what started it all for.
Me at least i wasn't popular as soon as.
I played amnesia but for the first time.
The five people i watched my videos they.
Really enjoyed it and i could tell i was.
On to something and this wasn't just new.
For me it was a new thing on youtube as.
Well and i had never played horror games.
Before it was genuinely horrible i made.
Montages and compilations of the best.
Moments where it's really just me.
Screaming they're kind of loud they're.
Kind of obnoxious but you got a charm to.
Them.
Music.
Eventually i had grown a thousand.
Subscribers but it was also clear i had.
Grown an audience that really cared.
About me i used to be an introvert and.
But youtube really helped me open up.
Because on the other side there was.
People that really appreciated the side.
Of me that i didn't show to anyone at.
This point i had completely failed.
School i'm sorry mom and dad.
My passion was somewhere else and i.
Famously started selling hot dogs to.
Sustain myself but i look back at this.
Time with great memories because i was.
Finally pursuing my goal my dream not.
Selling hot dogs but making videos in my.
Spare time that is at this time i.
Managed to meet a girl online who later.
Became my wife i won't bore you with.
Every step of the way of the journey it.
It's been long it had its ups and downs.
I made a lot of mistakes on the way but.
I've grown i feel like i have at least.
And i feel like i finally come.
Internship with the responsibility i.
Have as a creator about a hundred.
Million subs too late but you know but.
The channel has done a lot of good to a.
Lot of things i'm truly proud of we.
Literally raise millions of dollars to.
Charities and i'm really proud of my.
Audience for helping me do that looking.
Back at myself in that flight in sweden.
It's a very surreal experience i would.
Never ever have imagined this outcome.
Beyond my wildest dreams came true ten.
Times over a hundred times over i'm nine.
Years old there now i'm still awkward as.
But i finally got confidence in.
Myself and i'm really proud of who i am.
Today and instead of a hundred subs we.
Had a hundred million subs.
Music.
We did it i want to thank all the people.
I work with over the past couple years.
You know who you are i want to thank the.
People i collaborated with i want to.
Thank all the great friends i met along.
The way i want to thank my previous and.
Current editors michael bride sigh i.
Want to thank my family for supporting.
Me in doing something that i didn't even.
Know what it was and i want to thank my.
Dad for being by my side every step of.
The way.
But most importantly i want to thank the.
Prowse i don't need to tell you about.
The journey you already know it brofist.
Got a ladder in the post hmm what is.
