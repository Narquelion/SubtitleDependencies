Can't keep it going oh i think put the.
Ice here with the ice there yeah you're.
Crazy can you're crazy well you will get.
Lava right does the ice turn into water.
If we break it water in.
But it turns into cobblestone right now.
That works so like you know i love it.
There okay put the lava like here in.
That one by the box okay but grab that.
You almost made him put it in the dirt.
We need every block of dirt every blow.
Right all right come on get your head.
Again here we go okay okay what happens.
If you if you break the ice as it turn.
To water no no no he doesn't doesn't.
Doesn't isn't it okay how do you make.
The ice turn to water what if we put it.
Like right next to it like not next to.
It but like right next to it i'm saying.
Yeah okay okay okay so like here here we.
Put it there should i put it there i.
Mean we could try i don't think it's.
Gonna work like we want it you don't.
Think it's gonna okay okay kay what.
About this we put it here but put one.
Two three.
Huh nothing okay okay i'm going right.
One two three.
Music.
Nothing we can't pick that back up can't.
We.
No like i don't know if maybe if you can.
Like dig under it and then like melt it.
From the bottom reach maybe from the top.
It's usually goes from top through this.
Bedrock here bedrock wow we've where's.
The diamonds it bro broke don't even bro.
At me bro okay but put it put it put it.
That yeah yeah yeah that's the right way.
Okay okay.
How are you ready for this yeah i'm.
Ready for this we'll see it what is ice.
In this game we're trying to do science.
Here you know all the comments are like.
I'm cringing so hard because all we have.
To do.
Look gamers okay we know what we're.
Doing with will oh yeah yes we know what.
We're doing we're just showing other.
People what not to do we're just testing.
Your minecraft knowledge show this video.
To your mind for crafts girlfriend and.
Then you can be like oh what no what are.
You doing oh what it didn't work wait.
Come back.
Laughter.
Why did you tear that i told you he.
Doesn't work i'm a minecraft man right.
Now i have to restart the freakin.
Service okay well we know that we now we.
Know that's the way you don't do okay.
I'm trying to tell you feelings it.
Doesn't work if you break ice cinnamon.
Toast kid oh there's an orc from.
Breaking the ice this time you lay with.
James charles doesn't mean i'm like that.
How do we melt the ice this isn't making.
Four maybe you need some time right.
Maybe or maybe needs to be if it turns.
Into the next debate wait wait wait.
Maybe put the ice on top of the the dirt.
Tray they don't dig under the dirt so.
That way it doesn't turn our block of.
Water into cobblestones that make sense.
I don't know what your idea is my idea.
Is to put the lava on the bedrock i mean.
The ice on the bedrock in the pit of.
Lava over but we can do your idea cause.
Breaking the ice work i know i know.
Okay look i'm messed up that's fine okay.
You mean put that put the ice here and.
Then put the lava underneath there's.
Clearly bedrock here for a reason right.
So we don't dig ourselves death probably.
No but why isn't it why is it not here.
Then it's not yeah it's not on this it's.
Ah well i think we it's because we need.
To use it's on that okay okay well tell.
Me what to do something i don't know i'm.
Just saying i'm just like looking with.
My minecraft eyes right right right.
Right right so how many it goes three.
Deep one two okay we can dig one more.
Nope nevermind what the hell did i count.
Wrong one two three i'm an idiot.
We lost a block ken oh god okay we'll.
Just edit that okay cool.
Let's try the eye side eh yeah let's do.
Your eyes like there first and then we.
Do mind if that doesn't work put a block.
Right put a dirt block right back here.
Again right okay so exactly like before.
Well no i told you to put the dirt back.
Down we just stood there not paying.
Attention to me oh i'm sorry.
Yeah you should be all right let's see.
It melt then oh wow it's melting so good.
Look at it go oh my feet that's looking.
Hold.
Are we are we are wait it's ice-cold so.
You let me put on top of it well what.
Did we do before no i wanted to put the.
Ice on the bedrock i don't know maybe.
Okay you know what.
Let's let's explore maybe there's other.
Things in here oh i get it i get it you.
Need to burn the tree yeah yeah that's.
It okay the tree doesn't burn what is.
This game there's anything burned this.
Lava burn anything only you burn okay.
Let's look let's look around let's use.
Our brains they all get a tree i don't.
Know i just will assume that you can use.
Something to make it into water melt the.
Ice you know but nothing works okay but.
Here so here's the question for you why.
Do we need water because the lava and.
The water will make up of them then we.
Can make it all the way out there cousin.
Try to have enough logs right yeah but.
We could also we can cut down these and.
I think they drop tree branches and then.
We get more trees and we can plant the.
Trees and then more trees more wait it's.
So so that we're gonna sit here and.
We're gonna wait for trees to grow.
Listen i don't make the rules of.
Minecraft okay we got to make it across.
Look i'm almost there these are supposed.
To be every islands like a puzzle that.
We got to figure out how to make it work.
We're given everything we need all right.
We've gotta make that we got criticized.
In the water i'm telling you it's not.
How to do it oh look i got a stick it.
Came from the tree oh oh can can kick in.
I got it there is a tree branch there i.
Didn't google this but i know for a fact.
That breaking this i somehow is supposed.
To turn it into water i got it i got it.
I got it.
Look what there's nothing here tree take.
That.
Music.
Three said again break the ice.
Okay new brain let's try and blame my.
Kids game alright i'm in again i'm.
Looking up ice right now it says you can.
Break it and turn it into a water block.
Creating water ice can be used to create.
Water by either melting it or being.
Broken if there's another block directly.
Underneath the ice block the ice will.
Revert to water when broken with it.
Really you just need to break it.
It's what says if there's another right.
Underneath it while you do your stupid.
Ice thing this guy is gonna say dear i.
Didn't uh everything's fine it's me.
Drown all right well i'm finding a lot.
Of tree stuff here dude like this is why.
Well it became ice again possible i was.
A waterbender oh i got a tree i'm dead.
Okay so now we plant three nice look at.
This okay okay so and then now you lost.
The block cut stop stop losing block you.
Stop i'm making cobblestone give me that.
Lava put that love on that spot right.
There you still have a gun i don't have.
It did you not take it i'll get it.
Okay okay just don't hurt don't hurt.
Tree it didn't it almost worked.
We're close it has to be flowing lava.
Oh okay so make these be the okay maybe.
I need to reset the map again is that is.
That what we have to do ken yep but.
We're on the right track gamers all.
Right well maybe if you ask me next time.
What you're gonna do.
Doing you're the one that just taught me.
To do it it's the worst minecraft.
Experience yeah it's good for videos.
Though all the gamers out there just.
Raging their face off right now.
Now they know they know they will never.
Be this good you will never be this.
Minecraft minecraft choice friendships.
Okay alright so now okay you do your.
Little dude first try i got an oak.
Sapling oh are you still doing the tree.
We have done you don't understand.
Minecraft if you think trees aren't.
Important trees they're not they're fun.
Over there somewhere i need the space.
Game work well the tree needs space to.
Grow oh my god how am i supposed to make.
A lava infinite conduit here through a.
Deer here do it here how many spaces do.
Is it even on the top one two three four.
Through theoretics and careful with the.
Blocks gosh he hits me off.
Can they be yeah there we go so i need.
To make it still water oh maybe i need.
It it's like what do you need to make.
The waterford make the border so.
Thinking make the water ken yeah hey.
Where can that work.
What can i work we didn't work here just.
Put the water no he's not ready.

But the water here and then you have.
Lava flowing here okay yeah i'm gonna go.
Put the lava.
Yeah yeah right here where's yeah i got.
A bucket right okay yeah yeah yeah the.
Ice down no break the ice scoop it back.
Run over there.
You ruin oak tree every time we reset.
Oak tree dies that's why i'm really mad.
The lava needs to be flowing ken okay so.
The lava lava needs to be flowing water.
Okay what it doesn't matter okay glowing.
Lava to be 500 part series let's try to.
Get off the first okay okay i got i got.

Okay so you'll pick up here yes lava.
Here right no no no lava needs to be.
Flowing lava thank you.
Now it's flowing now it's you got you.
Pick up the carrot you scum i don't do.
This i think i need to be the water.
First before no no no no no and then.
Okay and then put the hey i'm just gonna.
What i move i'm just getting the.
Water first so i don't mess up the lava.
Can kick in work together teamwork okay.
Nobody next team at the teamwork.
Teamwork teamwork okay okay okay all.
Right there put the lava there then get.
The ice here and then the water will.
Flow in okay thank you.
We got a cobblestone baby that was that.
Thing that was epic closer maybe we just.

Uh-oh.
Hey drop it oh no.
There you go okay all right gamer i have.
A tree i'll put down the tree later.
Actually i'll put them to you all right.
So let's make the lava flow as much as.
Possible.
All right oh good all right we lost look.
It's fine the water will like run over.
To this yeah but the more the more.
Spaces that it runs over the more lava.
Will make so if anything maybe we should.
Remove this box and make the lava flow.
From really it's as high as possible so.
Like this make sense to you where would.
I say none of the flowing lava right.
Yeah and then we need flowing water and.
They need to meet so we need like a.
Separation can i do anything okay they.
Have to flow into each other they have.
To meet put put up put up the lava put.
Up the lawn pick it up yeah yeah yeah.
Pick up okay what we're gonna do is.
Gonna place them as high up as possible.
All right but they'll just run into each.
Other yeah well place scoot scoot over.
Please.
Scooch oh scooch over i'm scooch in okay.
So the lava will go from this one the.
Long tough work it's gonna it's gonna go.
Everywhere and then that's the point.
Yeah yeah yeah this is good okay this is.
Good.
Yeah yeah we want as much flow you want.
To put a water on top okay i got you.
Yeah yeah yeah maybe like i don't know.
How high we should put it and like maybe.
You'll make a little shoot avenge me oh.
Oh you stole it bam i'm fine.
