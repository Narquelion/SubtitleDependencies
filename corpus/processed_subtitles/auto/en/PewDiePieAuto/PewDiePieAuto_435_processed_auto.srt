Welcome welcome welcome today we're.
Reacting to a video what a great intro.
That was by the way today were reacting.
To a video that even my mom sent to me.
So you know it's pretty important what.
Indians think of pd pi versus t siemens.
So far the indians have been quiet their.
Voice have been silenced i assume by.
T-series themselves but now thanks to.
The channel asian boss we will find the.
Answer like i said my mom sent me this.
Video so you know it's gonna be good.
Let's just find out what the indians.
Feel about it hi.
It's chris from asian boss even with all.
The serious tensions between india and.
Pakistan at the moment the online world.
Appears to be more interest in their.
Battle for youtube supremacy as they.
Should i don't know actually i don't.
Know but they should this is what really.
Matters.
Okay worse are no longer fight through.
Soldiers and mercenaries they're.
Fighting through nine-year-olds we're.
Talking about pewdiepie versus t-series.
The question is do indian people even.
Know who pewdiepie is how big is.
T-series in india our asian boss.
Reporter manisha hit the streets of.
Mumbai to ask these hard-hitting.
Questions these are hard hitting.
Questions yes finally we will know i got.
I'm actually nervous have you heard of.
The brandy series yes obviously yes i.
Don't know if i like how they refer that.
Obviously okay i bet most people find.
Out about tea serious things to me.
Anyway.
If anything tc should be thanking me.
Viewers who might not be aware of these.
Theories can you briefly explain what it.
Fresh.
Their tribe music company we distribute.
Music albums and songs t-series the.
Biggest.
You know database of all i thought i was.
Gonna say biggest youtuber but no no.
Their intro database that's right there.
Yep see instead of primarily music and a.
Lot of it is the favor of india okay it.
Is a music label which makes original.
Music oh is that what they do they make.
Original music very interesting i.
Thought you know they just copyright and.
Other people's music that's really.
Strange.
How often do you come across these.
Series is a huge it is it it is a huge.
Brand actually most of the talk songs in.
India are made by t-series i think it is.
It has the biggest market share in with.
The music industry in this country that.
Sounds awful by the way one one company.
Making all the music for india don't.
Like the biggest channel right now from.
India that's right from india they keep.
Leading up to something.
But no it's the biggest channel from.
India that's right that's all you're.
Gonna get t-series let me do movies and.
Don't make me come to india by the way.
Everything is released via pc ds dt ds.
Is that one music destination well okay.
All right yeah how about a new song or.
Anything the only destination you'll be.
Going to the for the first place will be.
T-series i know that a lot of people who.
Watch you know a lot of in you know.
Videos and conveniently it was about.
Saying hey music bollywood music they.
Watch tcs on a daily basis and i know.
For a fact that one of the biggest.
Youtube channels in the world is tch an.
Emphasis on one of okay why do you think.
The series is so big ananda.
Oh okay first of all like the youtube.
Algorithm alright.
This kids this kid knows what's up it's.
The youtube algorithm that's all there.
Is.
I like this kid finally someone speaking.
Some truth here okay before sleeping be.
Videos rd right if they come up they.
Pose like 20 minutes a day youtube it's.
Like oh yeah we need to purge this no.
Human being can push to any videos a day.
Is the only advantage they have on me.
Catches on they come up with music that.
People really like so.
That is the basic reason okay fair.
Enough alright i don't want to keep you.
Know something on t-series i i can.
Acknowledge that they do make music.
Videos i i will acknowledge that they.
Make videos pete is keeping me in a.
Musical life giving the newcomers a.
Chance in india because music connects.
The whole world that's what i understand.
Any kind of art form connects the old.
Boys it's like    lasagna connected.
Literally everyone even indians are on.
Our side thanks to be society's not.
Wrong.
I just realized tea service is a music.
Company and we absolutely stomp them by.
Making a song that actually makes it.
Even funnier i never thought of it.
Because it's been closed for the longest.
Time yeah that's right a long revelation.
When it comes to their quality of videos.
And personally i alright this whole quad.
Who cares about quality anyway i got.
Great quality here you see the lightning.
Everything is top-notch that's why i got.
Great quality okay stop.
I do like i'm a fan of bollywood so it.
Becomes automatically become a fan of.
T-series personally are you a fan of tc.
Know the view i don't like indian music.

Crazy to think about dude if i his silly.

Can just look at my mood good so i was.
It i wasn't ready for the feels that's.
So nice hey we got blue blue shirt kid i.
Am subscribed to him for the meal for.
The baby.
The only reason i'm not subscribed to tc.
Reason because i don't want 20 videos a.
Day blocking - yeah damn right this kid.
Is the best in my friend circle he's.
Pretty famous because we all have been.
Falling in since a pretty long time.
Since the brofist time thank you.
Oh g bros from india that's awesome this.
Is so crazy how do you think find these.
People that's a familiar with the major.
Online battle going on between dc's and.
Purify yes this is i mean don't do that.
Obviously that would be cheating and i.
Don't condone that behavior whatsoever.
But that's awesome it's been going on.
For like months now yes it everybody's.
It verified like everybody's jumping.
Into it for views and everything i am.
Back what's your understanding of the.
Situation.
So basically pewdiepie is right now the.
Most subscribed channel thanks righties.
Is the most subscribed channel because.
Excuse me excuse me i think that's where.
You're wrong kid that's where you're.
Wrong it will never happen bro army too.
Strong okay.
Which they have in india it's like the.
Battle of subscribers right now.
Pewdiepie has been campaigning to retain.
His number one position but the series.
Is right behind him.
I wouldn't say right behind i would say.
Like if i look over i'd be like at.
Whatever you know were you being chased.
By so yeah we all can relate and you.
Look over and like oh god it's more like.
A yeah i can keep going it's fine.
That's how i would describe it but.
That's just me of course so just for fun.
Who are you more inclined to support in.
This life oh it's about to go down into.
Support pcs damaged i don't want to say.
I'm holding that above and position you.
Want ec yes more inclined to see their.
Antennas fill my childhood when i was.
Five or six years old and now i'm 24 23.
Then it's very good i need to fact-check.
This series when was teen series founded.
It sounded like a lie 1983 okay fine.
Fine whatever like who's counting and.
Though why not beautiful because i'm not.
Interested in gaming at all and he.
Called me i called t-series a business.
Idea okay bliss that's not even in it.
I'm sorry i'm sorry.
Come back to me i'm sorry for calling.
You bases i although foreign youtubers.
Are on side of pewdiepie and i also i.
Also inside a few jeepers because i.
Don't like theseus personally this.
Independent creator is still pewdiepie.
So it doesn't make a difference and even.
If he is not he's making the same.
Content it doesn't matter if he's like.
Above or below tc reason.
Not to me a dance this is so cool these.
Cds is just for singing random videos on.
The internet and becoming the biggest.
You do plan on the bed but that doesn't.
Really you know isn't fair for pewdiepie.
Because he's been working so hard for so.
Long individual youtubers like pewdiepie.
T-series is a big corporation who have.
They have like unlimited resources to.
Gain that's right i can't how can you.
Maintain his number-one position ok.
Just keep doing what he's doing right.
Now that it became de beauvoir if i'm.
Really desperate i mean i'm not.
Desperate of course but let's say i was.
Desperate like what do i do then.
T-series will have a good quality of.
Production but you can never beat what.
Pewdiepie other connection pewdiepie has.
With his audience oh yeah much better.
Than like anybody so that is why he is.
Popular see i do not like i do not like.
Not appreciated at first it's a good.
Thing that being an individual person.
But then somebody at some point of time.
Started p-series alone - right it's just.
Not like it just came to be a big.
Cooperation it started but that's not.
Necessarily true.
Okay a lot of companies start off really.
Big they have investors they have a lot.
Of people a lot of capital okay so even.
Though being an individual it's a big.
Thing but being a politician i think is.
Your enough to you know carry - so do.
You see him holding onto his number one.
Position or will he be overtaken by tc.
Oh yeah i guess be overtaken versus.
What because t series is becoming.
Popular and popular day by day so or.
Associating with more and more new.
Companies bollywood companies i think.
It's like it's very stylish to have like.
A battle it's regularly the t series is.
Not the win because the indian audience.
Is increasing so this model is from.
India coming on the internet saying here.
That t-series is going to win he does.
Not actually care about her tribal and.
He's not doing it like he has no.
Personal grudges honesty series it's a.
Tko i lost some people get it and some.
People are like it's a barrel he called.
Me    sonia so if we cross him i.
Think it'd be tough to compete as an.
Individual you have a hard time if we.
Cross him and he become number one.
T-series are still continuing to grow.
Because india geo whatever for a global.
Viewers who don't know what gos can you.
Explain basically geo is a wi-fi company.
That's offering like wi-fi at really.
Cheap hours now.
So like a lot of india is now suddenly.
On online damn this kid is so smart.
Youtube higher this kid okay so.
Basically india is getting internet.
Which is a good thing obviously i.
Wouldn't joke like oh that's so bad but.
Honestly that's terrible.
So basically india is getting internet.
And t-series dominates india obviously.
With it as soon as you make an account.
In india i tried this out myself.
You'll just be blasted by t-series.
Videos they have a huge advantage there.
But sooner or later they will run out of.
Indians and there are forever infinite.
Nine year olds do you see youtube as a.
Space where it's the platform for big.
Corporations to run ads or is it a place.
For creators to you know create content.
Actually both if you create content.
People are attracted and when people are.
Attracted then you can earn money by you.
Know showing ads youtube is encouraging.
A lot of creators in india and the.
Corporations are also using it for that.
Business used to be a individual creator.
Content thing but now with like.
Monetization and things.
Definitely moving towards that's right.
Company saying and you might say you.
Know what there's nothing bad with that.
And companies had the same set of rules.
That applies to everyone else.
But i think it's more a concern from the.
Community of youtube's been shifting.
Towards less creator focused for years.
Now and now seeing an actual company.
Taking over as the biggest channel.
People feel like that's a a symbol.
Almost of losing that another touch of.
The creator side of youtube creators is.
Why people love youtube and that's what.
Created youtube and i people want to.
Protect that i understand that i don't.
Think necessarily t-series is the fault.
For all of it obviously that's not how.
It is but i think that's why especially.
People are so caught up in this battle.
So interesting to watch this really like.
It there you go.
We used to get more content that we.
Can't get now everything is getting like.
Into the same algorithm like nervous.
1001 tt over quality that's what we're.
Getting now so the battle was supposed.
To be between pewdiepie versus t-series.
But the narrative has kind of changed.
And moved towards india vs. pewdiepie.
Know what you have to say about that how.
It may be because of youtube i said a.
Few things that i have heard a few.
Indians but it's ok no a few but.
Pewdiepie.
That is very i found it mission vision.
Not people should follow these series.
Not because only for the his.
I think these series have done a lot for.
As for the country also someone in favor.
Of what he said completely because at.
The end i mean in general tourism lies.
In to me the concept of nationality does.
Not come anywhere close to youtube like.
Being an indian i can support anybody i.
Want it is my content it's not that.
Indian people only like this you know.
True indian people like pewdiepie.
Everybody like it's about the content it.
Is not at all related to your.
Nationality and getting patriotism.
Inside it which is very dumb damn that.
Was an amazing video thank you asian.
Boss go check them out link in the.
Description obviously for making that.
That's so fun what a great insight it's.
Cool to see the kids so smart and hurt.
Yeah like articulate knowledgeable it's.
