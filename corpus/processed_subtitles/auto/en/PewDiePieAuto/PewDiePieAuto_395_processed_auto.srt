Damnit.
Yeah what's up everyone.
It's beautiful speaking of dirty shirts.
Have you ever tried saving money on.
Laundry well i know a guy that has his.
Name is marc and he will go to extreme.
Measures to save money or to make money.
I find this very fascinated i never.
Heard of extreme cheap stakes before.
Likes freaking watch people misplace.
Millions of dollars in loose change.
Every year and their loss is this.
Cheapskates gain wow so he just goes.
Around like a marc spends his free time.
Hunting down dimes nickels and pennies.
All over las vegas can you just get a.
Job.
Does he have a job no i'm self-employed.
So what do you do shut shut up legend.
I like our cuts from this shot him being.
Excited about a penny to him wearing a.
Suit and i run this casino i'm the owner.
Of this casino i just like extra change.
Sue me interesting all right well.
Clearly it's not a cheap steak if it has.
A dog okay.
That is completely contradictory i will.
Point out all the fallacies in there.
Really good person but obviously he's.
The extreme cheapskate nine it's got to.
Be so tough to be friends with a real.
Cheapskate i never heard that expression.
Before it's like i don't i wouldn't mind.
Paying for friends but at the same time.
It's like if they assume and it becomes.
A standard it's just kind of like all.
Right hmm i make it sound like i do i.
Don't but you know what i mean the penny.
Loafers from back in the day but the.
Interesting thing about this and this is.
How you can really tell okay what's.
Interesting about the shoes when my.
Roommates dog.
The top i took a marker and i penned in.
The black as not to buy a new pair.
Genius hold up let me do that i'll take.
A listen from mark here just paint the.
Pain away paint the pain away it's not.
Working it's chocolate.
Oh i should not just lick it after i.
Laughter.
Inked poisoning and he literally will.
Save money anywhere these shoes and all.
My dress shoes i get from the shoe.
Repair store people drop off the shoes.
They forget about them or don't have the.
Money to pick them up okay i mean fine.
So far i can't really blame that you.
Should take care of your shoes i agree.
With that.
Dude they're your life's way longer you.
Don't need that many shoes how many.
Shoes do you add tell me honestly.
Honestly i should do the same literally.
My shoes hold up.
Look at my shoes they're completely got.
All the bunches got the same problem as.
Mark i'll just paint it up thanks mark.
I mean all this i guess you could get.
Just get shoe backs or whatever whatever.
It's cold i don't know i'm not buying it.
Costs money.
Oh mark has a habit of doing things that.
Are a little bit beyond what i consider.
Cheapskate mark okay what is rihanna gin.
Under $60 a month by just regarding.
Expiration dates and spending no more oh.
Chicken i see a problem with that i mean.
I get it that's a classic thing if.
You're low on money you can buy expired.
Food and i'm not really here to shame.
Anyone for trying to save money by the.
Way it gets it gets more intense then i.
Basically it's one single item tortillas.
50 cent's powerbars 50 cent's cupcakes.
50 cent's peanut butter my health worth.
Nothing.
I'm dying healthily one dollar but his.
Thrifty habits don't stop there he pays.
Next to nothing for water each month by.
Refusing to use it cow an apartment you.
Still have to pay in the long term on.
Most dollar fifty on laundry because two.
Pieces in with everybody else wait you.
Can keep that washes and dries his.
Clothes.
Without spending a dime that seems kind.
Of shady laundry with you oh he asks.
Okay no no i wouldn't like that would.
You.
I don't mind laundry to gag ruined by a.
Other ever am i an    i don't know.
A few things not a lot maybe a few.
Things yeah got him got him.
Yeah right yeah hello my name is marco.
It's morning if you mind if i tossed in.
A few articles with your laundry man how.
Do how does he convince them do you mind.
If i throw in some water with you thank.
You oh see this is a perfect example of.
I wish i was nice but i'm not i'm not.
I'm just not see i wish i was nice like.
That man he didn't even know about the.
Cameras i guess sure legit there's good.
People out there and it ain't me and it.
Ain't you even stop pretending couple.
Things and then you find some mouth to.
Share a dryer with do you mind if i.
Throw some longer in with you just a few.
Items goddamn people are so nice what is.
This money some glitch in the matrix.
What it's just knowing how to stretch.
Your money knowing how to make extra.
Money knowing how to get the best value.
I guess i guess like no you know what i.
Probably would yeah i would i'm just.
Thinking like if you're i guess i would.
Assume if someone asked me to throw in.
Laundry with them they have to be really.
Poor so i kind of want to help them so i.
Am a good person of course and it's of.
Course easy for me to say this in.
Retrospect but he does not do it he.
Discerned it to save money for your.
Money that's the difference well he.
Won't spend a single cent on laundry.
Mark does like to gamble but even at the.
Casinos he's found a way to make sure.
He's never parting with his own money.
Wait what the hell so he's he's saving.
Money just we can gamble to feed his.
Gambling addiction why would he do that.
He'd buy a good buy g fuel we can but do.
Anything what a waste.
He saves money just to waste it what the.
Hell there was no money there mark and.
You goddamn knowing that i find i don't.
Spend more than $5 and i only play the.
Penny slots because you could win up to.
$10,000 have you won $10,000 mark i'd.
Only lose a maximum of five dollars not.
A whole page what the hell.
What you say money but you order drinks.
Out what the hell mark you're not a team.
Stake i keep calling it stink like a.
Cheap steak that doesn't cut it all.
Right if i went to a bar the strip would.
Cost me 12 to 15 dollars but by coming.
To a casino.
I played the penny slots win money and.
Drink for free money is free and casinos.
Money is free and casinos yes that's.
What i said.
Fraid so large alcohol alcohol i'm sorry.
I don't know what's wrong with me i.
Didn't sleep much on 67 cents this is.
What one dollar can do.
But i'm gambling i know when to stop.
Most people think oh yeah i'm gonna keep.
Going they double and double and triple.
I'm like no you got to know when to walk.
Away.
Martin all right it was fair enough i.
Respect that he goes around and always.
Looking for things to do to try to save.
Money first time that i realized he was.
Cheap was definitely when he was trying.
To get me to do every single medical.
Study that i could qualify for in the.
Past why mark has volunteered in more.
Than a hundred medical studies and the.
Riskier the trial the better it pays.
What i was doing clinical trials i would.
Get these scrubs i would take a pill he.
Takes a cold for daily work i mean yeah.
Why not in for doing other clinical.
Trials why not long wait the clothing is.
A huge problem for the environment mark.
Is saving the world guys we should be.
Thanking him cheap to clean and they.
Were free these are the scrubs from the.
Clinical trials these all represent a.
Part of history for example a part of me.
It seems of the eboli study this is my.
What what what this man is fearless.
Everyone was panicked with my friend and.
I did this study never tested on humans.
Or animals before we were the first in.
The country to have it done it's $5,000.
For a week so why would i not do it i.
Couldn't do it i can think of a couple.
Reasons if you could choose a bullet.
Wasn't that a super high death rate what.
The hell jesus christ dude i get saving.
Money but sacrificing your help i mean.
Then again someone has to do it so i.
Guess it's commendable trying to be from.
The crazier trials but mark's full well.
Into it the two studies that i'm waiting.
On that i have not been in yet is a.
Flatline study this is a really good one.
What they do is flatten my heart for one.
Minute but you still breathe stay there.
14 days pays $25,000 14 days you kind of.
Stepped in and stopped that the second.
One that i goddamn fda stop the heart.
Stopping surgery maybe it's a really.
Important one what.
He's so like yeah check this out they're.
Gonna stop my heart for 14 days i might.
Not come out of line and those goddamn.
If ta stop it oh jeez he says it's so.
Casually i think that's it i'm really.
Anxious and really excited and waiting.
To do is this testicular study what you.
Do is you go in and you donate one of.
Your chester goals they replace it with.
An artificial one and when you check out.
After 14 days you get a check for.
$35,000 damn 35 k for adjusted gail's.
Did he get would you do it 35 k what.
Would that be for me yeah yeah i don't.
Need to oh my god this mint is hardcore.
I'll give him that he's hardcore.
I may have underestimated him gets free.
Checkups every month to see if he's a.
Good candidate for each study free.
Checkup that's pretty good actually for.
A physical examination it's gonna take.
Some blood make sure that i don't have.
High cholesterol diabetes.
So what's motivating you to want to go.
Under the knife and be part of the study.
Like that.
The money has made a second the money so.
You're undergoing this serious surgery.
Where we gonna remove a part of your.
Body what is there morning my momma.
Money well at least he's honest i want.
To save lives i've read the study about.
This about destroys clinical trial and i.
Think it can help a lot of people's.
Lives out there so i know this it's just.
A big sacrifice for me but i know i'm.
Doing the money i'm doing it for the.
Money.
Laughter.
The money yes so i like how he's.
Correcting the doctor just replacing i.
Get a new one at one that doesn't hurt.
Probably don't have to h as much oh okay.
Have you ever had doctor says i i guess.
Say the doctor has to check if they're.
Crazy right is that that has to be a.
Thing right any a made lunatic i'm just.
Thinking i don't know what the procedure.
Is but it has to be a perceived ago for.
Sure okay and amy's eyes are so blue.
Crazy okay and also i gotta check out.
Your jobs okay now what i'm gonna also.
Say is you do have the man-boob thing.

Boobs right there hell yeah.

Converted into estrogen somebody go get.
There's testicle yanked out as part of.
This study that it could make the man.
Boobs bigger man he can make you.

Not nerve you need to bone smart save.

Risk to you it's pretty significant i'm.
Not endorsing the surgery mark's test.
