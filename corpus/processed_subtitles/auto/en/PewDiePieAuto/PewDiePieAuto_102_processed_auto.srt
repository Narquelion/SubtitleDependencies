Him and he said and everybody.
Around because he ain't got nobody.
To listen to listen to listen.
I'm a blue bubbly baba.
Pull up.
All right no one's here but i'm gonna.
Talk anyway i gotta i finally got like.
The.
Elgato hd pro it's the thing you used to.
Record uh.
Game console capture with i had it.
Forever.
And i just was so scared because it was.
Like oh you have to install it into your.
Computer.
What can you hear me by the way.
That'd be    awkward if i have to.
Tell this story this is funny because.
Like you literally just.
I was so scared because the idea of.
Putting something.
By myself and my computer was so was so.
Much more difficult.
In my head than it was in real life it.
So when i did it it was like.
Changing the head of a vacuum cleaner.
Like it was so easy and i felt so stupid.
For putting it off usually.
Computer related stuff is always more.
Difficult than you think it is.
But this time it was the opposite so i.
Was like what the.
This is funny now i can play on my.
Computer.
With the playstation which is really.
Nice.
Is there music though or am i missing.
Out.
I'm not sure i don't understand like.
Maybe i need to share the live stream.
Yeah that's it.
Members only or.
Out.
Yeah    why is no one coming to my.
Stream.
Okay here we go people are coming what's.
Up.
Danny fighter.
How are you this blessed morning.
Excellent no one cares danny fi i'm.
Kidding sorry.
You're the only one here i shouldn't be.
Roasting you.
Oh e lsd what's up gamer oh.
Sorry i did an oopsy.
You saw it from the discord server why.
Aren't.
Why aren't people seeing it anywhere.
Else.
This uh very confusing for me.
You saw it on youtube how many people.
Are in here there's gonna be like two.
People in here.
No worries no worries.
What's up gamers early gamers.
I feel like people can't get access to.
It.
Youtube is doing some weird algorithm.
Here.
There's no way.
This is no way.
All right maybe i'll just post it on the.
Discord then cause i i think youtube is.
It's like oh this is a hidden thing we.
Shouldn't share it.
But i still want my members to see it.
Obviously.
Yeah but it i i get that you guys got.
The notification but two people getting.
Their notification makes no.
Sense.
You're not special i mean you are sorry.
All right two people two people stream.
It why not you know what.
Great i don't care how many people are.
Watching.
Is the game too loud or something just.
Let me know.
Oh nice i can actually hear the game now.
I've been playing it.
Without hearing anything.
I think i will replay this game.
Honestly.
Music.
Um.
Music.
Um.
Are you talking about lsd now or.
Meditation.
Or meditation through lsd.
Whatever gets you off.
I'm not into drugs this is a play on.
My full name oh well that's someone else.
Whatever gets your eye off and eats soy.
Alchemy.
Yeah i know i know.
Certain type of drugs can help you reach.
Some sort of.
Ego association which makes you it.
Changes you as a person but i'd rather.
If i wanted to reach some sort of.
Conclusion about myself and my ego i.
Want to reach that on my own and not.
Help through drugs because.
I want to be able to return to that.
Place on my own.
If i ever get there not.
Relying on drugs to get there.
Go sit under a freezing waterfall until.
You realize well i guess that's.
What i'm gonna have to do isn't it i.
Wouldn't mind.
It's a journey there isn't it i'll get.
There.
Uh i want to upgrade some stuff real.
Quick.
How's the is it is the game play too.
Loud or too low.
Oh no.
I like when you really practice your.
Mindfulness you can sometimes feel your.
Blood moving through your body i know.
What you mean actually.
That's a good idea i was a good minute i.
Didn't practice i'm.
Trying to really feel your body because.
It takes you out of your mind to do that.
Uh do i want to upgrade this no.
Motokuyo.
Music.
I think i'm really close.
Yeah we're almost maxed it out so i.
Might as well go for that first.
All right let's do a main quest because.
Everyone wanted it last time.
Maybe i shouldn't do many questions.
Since no one's really watching right now.
What do you guys reckon it feels a bit.
Like.
Because people really want to see them i.
Might as well wait.
Am i going to play ballarant again.
Honestly valerian seem pretty.
Fun i can see myself getting into it.
I'm not proponent of drugs but some.
Things give you a glimpses into another.
Side of your consciousness.
Sounds like you are a proponent of drugs.
My dude no shame.
Do what you want to do i don't care.
Damn this looks pretty.
I love the clear what blue sky this.
Makes me uh miss winter.
Isn't that crazy.
It takes into a state of mind that when.
You try to recreate.
That sober assume it's not the same.
Well yeah that's drugs for you.
All that white hurts my eyes ah put on.
Dark mode quick.
My eyes start burning out.
Let's    these guys up.
I got.
So    cool.
Ready.
They're really strong.
Music.
One enemy actually takes time.
Float.
This is like far cry japan yeah.
I think with most drugs your body.
Becomes desensitized to the enhancement.
To your constitution but mindfulness to.
The effects.
Become more by now yeah i mean i guess.
Another word of mindfulness in this.
Scenario for me is like.
I'm very much against it but i'm also.
Open to the idea that i.
Have never tried it so i can't really.
Judge it but i i just know it's not.
I know it's something i don't want to do.
Oh we got a mythic quest here i didn't.
Realize.
Let's go for it then.
Thank you jay appreciate it.
Do i usually talk about drugs in these.
Streams no i don't think so.
It just was brought up.
Laughter.
Foreign.
Alcohol is a drug.
Nicotine is a drug.
Is.
Blue.
Music.
Uh.
I like the song is playing it's popping.
There's hardly anyone in this stream i.
Don't don't understand why.
Thanks for being pierced floor gang out.
Thank you matthew.
It is very chill though so i'll take it.
It's a lot easier to stream and there's.
Only a couple people.
Guess we got to climb this mountain.
Yeah i'm into it.
Which mountain though i can't even see.
It it's so semrina.
Oh.
So oh i see so you have to it's an.
Element of gameplay.
I don't realize.
If you can    off mr dog because i.
Clearly need to hurry the    up.
Oh it's taking damage now.
Oh my god it's right there.
Here we go.
That's kind of fun.
Unexpected but yeah.
I wish i could sit in the game.
Like dark souls style.
Why is my camera inverted well i'm so.
Glad you asked.
Because you see the gameplay is here so.
It makes sense.
That i'm like looking at the gameplay.
Nice attention to detail.
Do you understand let's see how my hair.
Looks like a.
Ball thank you.
Ah yes yeah.
Okay so we need to find the next flame.
Pretty quick.
Otherwise we are toast or the opposite.
Of toast i should say.
All right here we go ascend mount.
Joe i don't have time for dogs.
Oh god.
I'm sorry doggy dog.
Where am i supposed to go clearly here.
If there was a dog here but i.
Oh i see it i see it.
When i learned that word the first time.
I always thought it was samus.
It helps oh you're dead.
I'm gonna die oh i'm stuck.
I can't uh.
Well i'm dead where do i go up.
Can i jump back at least.
No i can't right.
Where do i go up oh there.
Oh my god it's i can make it easy.
The    i can't believe i almost died.
There cringe.
I'll become a white walker soon.
I haven't seen game of thrones or read.
It.
But i understood the reference that's.
Epic.
I can sit a little bit i guess.
I can sit a little bit.
I don't really have time for dogs.
I was hoping there would be a.
Grappling hook place there and i just.
Went for it.
Guess not zero deaths cringe.
Well this is going great.
It said it's so hard to see.
I don't know where to go.
Maybe i'm supposed to go up on the side.
Here.
No.
Oh there it is yeah.
Come on just go can't really see.
There we go.
Nailed it what's up samurai.
Nice we can upgrade our sword now how.
You doing mame.
Frost coast my body a final suit of.
Armor buried in silver.
That was beautiful we're almost there.
Cool quest.
I'm not sure why the stream is not.
Alerting everyone.
But uh it's a very chill chill group of.
People.
I think we're less than a hundred.
This looks a lot easier than the other.
Ones because i keep getting lost.
Otherwise.
I know i know bro i know.
Uh now where the    do i go from here.
Excuse me.
Where it must be over here.
Yeah there it is.
Oh this is a close call dude.
We made it.
Squishy.
Nice.
Nice.
Is our cool picture to be taken here.
This is what it really looks like.
If anything i just want like.
I want like uh.
This with the audio and uh.
That's cool an animation like a.
Recording of it and then have that.
Animated like a.
Maybe use wallpaper engine or something.
That'd be    cool.
That looks cool too much.
Too much looks good on its own.
Let me actually try and get a better.
Pose.
Oh i love how you can see the ocean.
Really struggling here.
I feel like this would look better.
Without me.
Um.
There we go that's what i wanted.
Yeah it feels like a loading screen.
Isn't it.
Can you record video clips.
What is happening.
I guess i can't record it off my.
Elgato i'll just record it directly.
Congrats on getting on the top of kevin.
Kaise.
Thank you thank you i might make this.
Into a wallpaper on my computer.
Hey fitz i just want to thank you for.
Being like a father to me i'm autistic.

But you have always been a great role.
Model.
And you inspired me to better myself.
Every day thank you may.
That's so nice infinity.
Don't push yourself too hard.
I don't know what sounded patronizing.
But i feel like i do that with my son.
It's always good to improve yourself is.
What i mean but.

Wallpaper engine.
It might be cool let me try and color.
Grade it so it fits my computer a little.

Computer let me do it again.
You guys use wallpaper engine.

Mine.
Got the rain it's comfy got the blue.
Theme.

Yeah windows looks different.
It's kind of cool it's got a different.
Like.
Big like it.
Important things you know things that.
Truly matter.
All right back to the gameplay.
Where did the gameplay go oh god what.
Have i done.
Oh i removed wrong.
Video capture device.
Oh god what did i do there we go.
There we go we're back.
It reset the audio though is it too loud.
Now or is it okay.
When you can't tell your gameplay from.
Your wallpaper.
It's a problem.
It's hard to tell this is win well i'm.
Sorry.
All right let's keep should we keep.
Playing the game.
Should we try that all right.
We got to be hurry hurry here we go.
Hurry here guys that's english right.
At least it's obvious where to go now oh.
God i spoke too soon.
This is a weird universe repeats just a.
Small streamer.
Yeah right alternate small streamer.
Pewdiepie universe.
Uh.
And we're hot and it's how.
Okay i guess we go here.
Someone else uh died there that's pretty.
Cringe.
I think we're going down here aren't we.
Yeah doesn't look as cold as before.
There's a thing there.
Oh god i'm supposed to swing somewhere.
That was a tricky one.
Is there any nihongo bros in the chat.
Why did they add kai at the end i never.
I've never heard.
Sleep comes drawing near deeper i begin.
To sink cold and slow step.
Sheesh.
Did i just i just run past it to go.
Back no i didn't do that right.
Am i that dumb it felt like i walked in.
Circles there.
I am lost.
Yeah uh excuse me where do i go though.
Didn't i just go here oh god i'm going.
In circles.
It i'm going for it huh.
It's a    bear.
Kumasan i don't have time for you.
Get the    up.
Applause.
Someone built a    dojo here.
What a legend.
Foreign.
Foreign.
Nice this is so cool.
I love that it's so japanese to build.
Places in pharah.
Locations a friend of mine told me about.
A ramen place that's like.
Built on top of a mountain so you have.
To walk all the way just to get it.
It's like at the most obscure spot ever.
But it's still.
Popular.
I'm sure the ramen isn't that good but.
It's like the journey to get there.
All right we're gonna fight this guy why.
Why.
Aren't this awkward i'm not getting a.
Prompt.
Well glitchy i guess.
What is happening i want to fight you.
He said find a rock.
I guess i wasn't paying attention this.
Is awkward.
Teach me.
Here we go i don't have any resolve.
I used all of it i should have killed.
The bear.
In before frostbite.
Oh god.
Well that's a little harder.
This is going to be tough i don't have.
Any resolve in this battle.
All right.
Music.
I.
Music.
Is.
I didn't see the prompt i was so focused.
On the combat i did not see the text in.
Front of me.
Music.
You fight with no honor.
You didn't study the blade deeply.
Oh    oh    that's cheating.
Music.
He's letting me fight him that would.
Have been a lot easier.
Come on.
Music.
Okay so hold to switch ghost weapons.
Where the flame oh okay so it's two.
Charges.
That's really useful.
I kind of want to check out this guy's.
Dojo a little bit.
So like any    up here you know you.
Know i'm saying.
I love the the duels i wish they made a.
Whole game around it.
It's like the most fun part.
Right and then have multiplayer aspect.
To it kind of like for.
Honor if they made a second one skip all.
The.
Cut scenes and    i don't give a.
Have it more focus on the duels have.
Multiplayer options kind of like.
Bloodborne.
That'd be so    cool.
That would that that went well this is.
The back end.
Hopefully there's a cool little.
View from point i expect it a bit more.
Oh i like the red in the sky.
And every skype.
What should we go for.
I really like when you can't see.
Anything.
Have you guys played rage shadow legends.
Wow i'm glad i'm.
I'm glad i'm in the chat i don't i don't.
Like it.
Oh that just goes down all the way.
A musician it was crazy i almost freaked.
My ass off but i found you.
I mean him.
Dude this guy knows how to play.
Purity of war new mask huh.
The fire of war is fury cannot be.
Contained.
Uh we got ourself a new mask check it.
Out.
I do quite like the one we have.
Haunted dreams worn by those who have.
Seen.
Death that's pretty    badass.
Kinda want that.
Is that the one.
Mask is really cool too.
Nasty that's cool.
That looks cool.
There it is it doesn't match it's just.
Kind of ugly.
I think i like that one.
Which one is more aesthetic because.
That's really what i give a    about.
I think this is the most aesthetic one.
It doesn't look good in this light.
Though.
The pain of being a man.
They all look terrible in this light.
What the.
Can someone change the light please it's.
Almost like the game lets you alright.
Haunted dreams it is.
Music.
Red goes better yeah.
Let's try it see how it looks like nope.
That looks    terrible.
That's the one let's go with that i.
Don't    care anymore.
We can upgrade our sword that's what we.
Can do right now.
Get the n95 mask.
I didn't think of that.
Also i remember pete saying i didn't buy.
The digital.
Deluxe version of this game what would i.
Do with it.
Okay yeah now i regret it maybe.
It just i don't know they're just trying.
To squeeze extra money out of you i'm.
Not down with actually.
Boom.
Boom.
Pewds growing as a channel yeah thank.
You.
We upgraded everything yes.
Yes where's the the boyers over there.
Where's the armor.
Any gifts i shall accept guardians.
Scowl for someone aiming to disassociate.
From.
Physical pleasures and striving for.
Minimus valley why are you building a.
Clothing brain.
Uh good question.
It's step by step process i would say.
It's also fun.
I feel like if i cut i like i know what.
I need to do to get there.
But if i i know if i do it all at once.
It's not a good idea.
And it's also harder when some some.
Stuff are tied into your business.
So it's like bigger decisions to make.
But yeah i think i think especially not.
Tsuki per se.
Because we're more environmental.
Uh conscious but like the merchant that.
I sell.
Is obviously not good for the.
Environment and i do feel kind of.
Strange about that.
Where is the armor like it.
It is fast fashion and um i'm.
Technically against it.
There's also problems because if i don't.
Sell it people will be like where is it.
Where is it i would not hear the end of.
It.
And i i don't know i guess there has to.
Be a way and.
The problem is actually if i sell merch.
For a higher price because that's what.
It would cost.
To produce like more i got on a.
Different tangent here that's not what.
You asked but.
Um people would complain.
Because the prices wouldn't be higher oh.
Yeah step by step.
I want to upgrade the ghost armor.
What the    are you doing get out of.
My shot i'm trying to look at myself.
Are there any cool arm uh.
Like clothing options.
I can't see anything.
What should we do next.
How long have i been streaming should i.
Open up the floodgates.
It's a has been an hour all right well.
It's been fun.
Chilling with you y'all it's time to.
Open up the floodgates.
All right i'll be right back i'm gonna.
Get a drink.
Oh.
Okay.
Um.
What's up.

Walking in the wrong direction.
It looks so appealing over here.
