Gay makes me think i retract it corbin.
You're not gay.
I changed my mind uh kind of went after.
Me because.
Uh i had a wedding ring oh god no.
Because you're wearing a key.
The key is it's the key to all of this.
Who here has kissed a dude or been.
Kissed by a dude i think it's by a dude.
Everyone.
Yeah    yeah i kissed guy what.
So why gay i kissed guy a little time.
Ain't nothing gay kissing men.
Two men ain't nothing gay about that is.
Manly nothing man near the two guys.
Can't argue with science.
Kiss at least you can't be a simp if.
You're gay huh you ever thought of that.
You    homophobes kiss the dude yes.
I think it's by a dude who here has.
Kissed a dude and liked it.
We're not saying it's wrong we're saying.
It's game my dude that's different.
No there's nothing wrong carbon but it's.
Gay do you understand.
Uh yeah i've been kissed by a guy and.
I'll never forget it because it was the.
Most traumatic experience of all time.
And i don't understand how women does it.
I felt the beard that i don't want to.
Feel and i'll never forget it.
I don't even want to talk about it i.
Accidentally kissed my best friend on my.
Birthday one of my best friends.
You don't accidentally kiss an accident.
Yeah it was really funny my girlfriend.
Sounds like you're lying jared we have.
Six straight men and one secretly gay.
And then one secretly secretly gay.
Yeah so clear now wow.
Like okay so ah damn it who who knows.
Who won the super bowl.
Was that does that matter when i don't.
Watch it oh my my dude you're gay.
Does that matter oh he's so gay he.
Brought that up because he thought that.
Would be a good lie.
Right he brought that up so he could be.
Like oh yeah he had that ready in his.
Head before he went in.
Who can say who won the super bowl he.
Tried to go and attack there.
But he failed completely because all the.
Guys are like what.
That has nothing to do with your sexual.
Orientation corbin.
What are you gay or something yeah wait.
Jason.
Oh yeah uh corbin's out i didn't think.
He was the mole yeah.
But when it came down to it i was like i.
Gotta play for strategy i gotta win.
Really.
Yeah corbin only person you asked the.
Question too.
That's what happens in all of these.
Episodes is the only person they ask a.
Question to.
Is the one that gets voted out has.
Anyone here been mistaken for.
A gay person i get mistaken for being.
Gay all the time which is why i don't.
Think like it's.
You could tell by someone yeah exactly.
Tell through their story.
I don't get mistaken for being gay what.
Does that say about me.
I mean how could you identify a person.
By their physical appearance whether.
They're gay or not i don't think that's.
Possible and that's the conversation i.
Tried.
It's definitely possible because you all.
Just proved it by eliminating corbin.
I feel like for this to be effective we.
Have to put everyone kind of in the spot.
And like and then everyone else just.
Analyzes them.
Ask me questions you mean the point of.
The show my dude.
Wait wait look at my eyes real quick are.
You gay no.
Look at my eyes real quick are you gay.
Laughter.
Because they don't know what the.
They're doing this is so hard.
I asked andy and just because it can't.
Just be like oh.
Everyone gangs up on one person because.
Like then the gay person has.
A chance like hide in the shadows or.
Hide in the noise you know.
It was they keep going with a looking.
Strategy seriously.
It was if they're gay they're gonna act.
Different they're very like.
You know 1960s like mindset in that.
Which is funny and i was like.
I don't think we're gonna get anything.
Out of this i know i don't think so.
Either cena penis.
I've seen multiple penises how how did.
You feel about them.
What is this strategy i can't.
What did you feel about them.
Has this guy ever met a gay person what.
Do you feel about the penis.
When was your first girlfriend my first.
One was probably like.
In college yeah it was it wasn't very.
Long though so yeah my thing could be.
About i'm like muslim so my thing is.
Like it's just dating is just usually.
Very.
Unconventional and it's like very like.
Limited so i mean.
Is that a thing in muslim culture i'm.
I'm basically mainly on his uh posture.
And gesturing.
I feel like as far as like religion goes.
I mean usually is another thing where.
It's like.
Really pretty devout i would say yeah.
Okay.
Like i grew up like going to the mosque.
And everything it's a very like don't.
Ask don't tell.
It's something that needs to be.
Addressed there should be a lot of love.
Coming out just in general you know it.
Shouldn't be something.
Maybe we were a bit we jumped the gun a.
Bit on.
Colleen because nabil uh yeah it's gonna.
Be like i changed my mind it's not bl.
People get ostracized for doing what.
They do and being who they are how's.
Your relationship with your dad.
How's your relationship with your dad.
What the    are you trying to ask him.
Out.
Play baseball with him sit why is that a.
Question it's a relationship.
I'm not actually a jerk guys last person.
Open book.
Uh give it to me jonathan do you shave.
Your butt.
What do you wax no i don't i don't you.
Know that he can just liar right what.
The.
What is this guy's question that's so.
Good.
You sure you're right because that gay.
No.
Oh i guess you're not gay then we don't.
I don't okay unfortunately.
Sorry have you ever had a threesome i.
Have not i.
Like i don't i don't understand it like.
I gotta focus on one person.
And who usually who's that one person a.
Man or a female a girl yeah okay.
Laughter.
They are so bad they are so bad this is.
The worst episode i've ever.
Seen this guy looks like a lost kid in.
Legoland.
Have you kissed a dude he said he didn't.
I i have.
What was okay what was the situation.
Don't you want to say no.
I don't want to say no i want to be.
Honest i've kissed a guy because i was.
Like i could be bi.
And then turns out i wasn't what would.
That make you the mole.
No way he went out he's definitely it's.
Not wesley raise your hand if you think.
The mole is still in the square and you.
Would like to continue the game.
You just gotta be safe the calling out.
Is so like bad i apologize but it's a.
Game it's a game you just say it i think.
You're gay.
Right and so this is what i think.
There's a lot of.
Dominating the conversation the body.
Language and trying to control.
Everything.
I thought he was acting maybe too macho.
Okay maybe he is.
Over playing no i don't have a straight.
Role i don't think i'm going to look at.
Wesley.
You know what really sucks about this.
Guys is we became friends and now i feel.
Like we're not.
So like after this is over can we still.
Get beers yes all right.
If you want to the one thing i'll say.
I'm sure if you guys vote me off.
All right let's do that then one eight.
Times what a guy or.
Gaydar being right in real life i don't.
Believe in that kind of a thing.
Oh sorry that's so hard i've been pretty.
On.
I would say my brother he's he's gay.
And i didn't know until he came out and.
I was like whoa what the i was like.
Shocked.
Okay and so yeah the like case.
Stereotypes doesn't really match up.
But did it ever like cross your mind or.
Anything like did you ever even think.
About it.
No i didn't it's a lot because a lot of.
The times like what you're not paying.
Attention to.
Right it's like it's easy to miss you.
Know what i mean.
Right i just i thought dude yeah.
Disqualifying.
Yourself he's very quiet.
Very quiet dude.
It's him what's the.
Gayest thing about you all dude honestly.
Growing up me and my friends literally.
Just like poked out that's pretty smart.
What the    really hey dude no.
Dude what happened take two fingers or.
Something no let me explain.
It's so gay it's so.
And there's this thing called where it's.
Like horseplay or whatever.
Oh yeah behind one of your friends and.
Like ain't nothing gay about.
Penetrating your your boys huh i did.
That come on.
You're like finger up their butt that.
Ain't gay that's epic.
And not saying gay is an epic but like.
Bro why'd you move over there.
I'm just i'm just trying to they're.
Called right and so like basically.
I'm not hating i thought it's funny but.
I was with him in it like okay i hear.
You i don't think you're it.
Is that considered gay because that's.
Gay happiness like people might be like.
Yo that dude's a little too happy i'm.
Like yeah i am.
That's a good thing i think the gayest.
Thing that is.
So this is the weirdest episode we've.
Gotten so far.
I can't believe this is just a bunch of.
Dudes that.
Are brewing it out it's so funny.
Everyone's like oh my god are you gay.
And i'm like does it matter but how.
About how does that situation come.
Across are you like hey can i massage.
You.
It's all consent it's all consent no so.
They're my friends if you do gay stuff.
Like.
You're cool you're probably not gay wait.
What.
Say say.
Say that one again cheap what do you.
What was eight if you do gay stuff like.
You're probably not gay.
Where did they find this guy uh it's.
Such a good episode.
I love it i remember in school like so.
Everyone.
All the boys were teasing each other oh.
You're gay.
Oh you're gay oh you're gay ain't.
Nothing wrong with being gay.
Even if you're not gay you know what i'm.
Saying and i'll tell you what.
All the people that always went oh.
You're you're gay.
They are hiding in they are doing it.
They're projecting it.
At least that's how looking back out of.
My class.
The people that went oh you're good.
They're the gay ones.
Just like taste and music you know i'm.
Like a beyonce fan i've been listening.
To like britney spears since like day.
One like that's the kind of stuff like.
I'm just really into like pop music and.
Uh that's that's my thing i guess.
Now that makes me think he's not gay.
Anymore i don't know.
If i do ask you yeah no homosexuality on.
Like the.
Like the muslim community yeah that's.
Fine i feel like a lot of religious.
Organizations kind of take that.
Conservative approach where they're like.
Okay you know just uh.
Everybody's allowed in the religion the.
Thing that throws me off about his.
Argument and i don't know if i.
Understood it correctly.
But i think he was mentioning like yeah.
I'm not gay because i'm.
I'm par i'm part muslim or something.
Like that and they're not very accepting.
Of gay people which i don't know if.
That's even true or not but.
That was his argument but that doesn't.
Make him not gay that just makes him.
Muslim if that right i i.
I think he i think it's him you can't.
Really so if you were would you be.
Comfortable like coming out.
Would i be yeah probably not just i'm.
Being honest for myself and just because.
I know how muslims are like i probably.
Wow if it's not wanting to be alive.
That's crazy.
Wesley and evan whoa.
I don't like this game anymore can i go.
Music.
Home.
Evan sorry dude sorry brother i thought.
Wes was definitely.
The guy that's right i don't think it's.
I wanted to split the money with evan.
But if everyone else is being greedy or.
So i thought then i guess i got to be.
Greedy with everybody else.
This is what i'm thinking all right.
Because saying i'm muslim is like the.
Ultimate trump card of saying like.
Yeah yeah i get that yeah that's right.
Anyone could be a liar.
And i was like that is such a strong.
Play to use it's either.
Absolute truth or it's absolutely a lie.
Because he threw out the muslim card i.
Don't want to be controversial so.
Therefore.
He's trying to play it up and then.
They're yeah you said nothing.
Controversial so far.
He is what you're saying bro are you.
Just gay no but we can't.
You can just tell me are you guys okay.
Okay jonathan are you gay no i'm not hey.
Hey.
We're homies this is i'll tell you what.
This is the only episode of all of them.
I've seen.
I think that i remember that they've.
Literally just keep.
Asking straight out are you this are you.
The mole.
Get dude just be honest like it's like.
We're just.
Chilling here bro.
I'm just so disheartened right now nabil.
Nabil there you go that's the strategy.
Right yeah yeah there you go.
To be honest i'm not surprised i made it.
As far as i did in the game i feel like.
I played that hand really strong and i.
Was just like you know what.
I'm a muslim it can't be me raise your.
Hand.
If you would like to continue the game.
Can we talk about this for a second.
Come on continue the game dude continue.
The game no jared continue the game.
He didn't want continue.
I want the money because i'm competitive.
But i think the moles out.
Yeah right play the game come on we lost.
Is this is called trust.
This is where it happens we lost.
Oh my god look at him.
It's so funny oh my god i'm so nervous.
Music.
Applause.
Yes.
All right so who is it i am so confused.
Hey who's the mole wait.
All right who do you think it is.
Honestly type a comment now.
I think oh it's gotta be the guy that.
Just went out four cups dude.
I was shocked i thought it was what what.
Blessed the entire time i'm happy that i.
Made it as far as i've made.
It well done that got it right away and.
There are some like.
Okay i know this is going to be high.
Inside i thought he looked gay but he.
Was too.
Like obviously gay looking that it was.
Like i don't know.
There was never a point where i thought.
Evan was the all well there you go.
You can't know if someone's gay or not.
It's got nothing to do with your.
Appearance.
I think we proved it here thanks to.
Jupiter well done and let me just say.
Again.
Whatever you preferences sexually ain't.
Nothing wrong with that.
It's respect why don't they just ask.
Describe your ideal girl that's a good.
Point.
Yeah dude let's just all kiss each other.
Whoever likes it is okay.
I feel like they were this close to.
Doing that not available.
Who kissed the dude almost all raised.
