This one goes out to all my gamers out.
There we've all been there you know this.
Feeling i wake up early in the morning.
Making gas weep.
It's like i'm in the nether cuz i can't.
Sleep in case you got amnesia man i want.
That blue stuff i got my are a pig peg.
With a for chew but i'm a white obey.
Because that's where it's found i'm so.
Frickin low keep adam underground i got.
Big dreams of tearing at some big scene.
Hit the big leagues but you don't have.
This blue but you don't have this green.
But you don't have the biggest ball the.
World is see ya you think i'd be.
Satisfied no i got the best life it's.
Easy to see and a hundred million people.
Agree because i'm mine all day all night.
Don't stop till the stomachs are inside.
Don't mind all the time but you find.
What i want mind all day.
I mind all night mine don't stop till.
The stomachs are inside and of mine your.
House i mind your mom of my my tears.
Till the break of dawn i think we hit.
Bedrock what does that mean there's.
Nothing deeper than feed the    is way.
Too easy i swear it doesn't please me.
I'm like a reaper gleaning when i take.
My chicken squeeze it and fill this.
Power breezing soon be 60 sheep believe.
I'm bored of being at the peaks of time.
To see what lies beneath what smoochie.
My gamer was brewing my gamer got that.
Enchanted shin lapis lazuli my gamer.
Little    over system ii no matter.
