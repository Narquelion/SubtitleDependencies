Most famous of all the yo-yo tricks yo.

Finger movement yeah wrist and finger.
Movement oh oh oh i got the trick i.
Understand that was amazing dude once.
You get it you get it once you got it.
You got it i'm ready for the yo-yo.
Championships you have to understand.
That i'm also being watched that makes.
Me a little nervous you know if i wasn't.
Filming i could do all of these tricks.
On the first time it was good flying.
Saucer what is that not only is the.
Flying saucer fun to watch but it also.
Adjusts the twist or the tension of the.
Yo-yo string see the yo-yo comes out.
Takes an angle in the sleeper position.
Continues until it's fly absolutely flat.
And then you bring it back to the hand.
Now the reason it does this is unlike.
The other tricks the yo-yo release is.
Not straight down it's to the side see.
That yo yo man just plug it to the side.
About what that's so cool boom back to.
The palm of the hand now let's see how.
We do this trick you take your.
To the side seat right from the start.
45-degree angle.
Now watch in a sleeper position the.
Yo-yo is cocked a little bit see it now.
It's even continuing till it's.
Absolutely that's impossible that's.
Physically impossible in the strings.
Where you say we get up four to six.
Inches above the yo-yo that's insane.
Physics don't make sense anymore i'm.
Serious i can't even make it spin at.
That angle oh my god i did okay so it is.
Possible oh oh no your man can do it.
This okay i understand i'm fine.
Didn't even hurt have you seen that meme.
Where the guy shows off his pokemons on.
Thanksgiving to his parents that feels.
Like what this is oh holy moly smoly.
I did it almost this reminds me of a.
Time of one there you know when.
Everything wasn't discovered already you.
Can just do a bunch of cool    you.
Know what i mean.
Oh wow this messed up the thread.
Completely oh god it's all ruined.
Do you know what i mean i understand the.
Mix of philosophy and yo-yo now it's all.
Coming together it's like my skating was.
Inventing it was like this new thing and.
People are trying to test the limits of.
What kind of thing you can do with it.
Yo-yo is in venice.
Like what can you do for the yo-yo what.
Do we have now fortnight huh is that.

Ruined my life.
Alright.

Too strong did he ask for gold silver or.
Other material goods because.
Materialistic items will never make you.

Suspenders is just a token of your.
Adaptation of the philosophy and it.
