Already seen the abundance of memes that.

Get this wisdom well of course.
Keanu reeves number two reason why so.

This it's as a nun indisputable fact at.
This point look at this portion this is.
Early 1500s portrait of a man the gang.
Signs a gang steinbeck a lot of weird.
Finger things you tell us kyon oh it's.
Late there lilly you you have a likeness.
In the eyes yeah no the mustache and the.
Beard and the cheekbone and everything.
Yeah we have the same forehead ish i i.
Think there's a website called keanu.
Reeves is immortal calm there des this.
Canneries is immortal calm here it is he.
Doesn't age here's to prove the website.
Has been updated 2077 still has an age.
Even here how old is he is over 50 and.
The paparazzi referred to him as young.
Man that's right young man i know you.
Turned 50 last month an unhappy birthday.
But it's hard to believe looking at you.
Madam maybe i'm getting older or you're.
Just very very youthful but you i would.
Never he does nate number 3 keano has a.
Very sad paced.
Sad keanu was a meme that appeared a few.
Years ago before meme review was a thing.
What there were memes before meme review.
What the freak this was in the era of.
Memes where people just found a picture.
They thought was funny and everyone just.
Photoshopped it that was really it i.
Look how many counters look how sad he.
Is next to sad panda legends say that.
Keanu is still sitting and still sad.
Sipping that jpl when i was digging on.
The web about you i came across this.
About you.
This phenomenon the sad keanu oh gosh it.
Was a couple years ago yeah oh man where.
People picking fights with you sitting.
On a bench eating a sandwich looking a.
Little bit sad and it became like this.
Crazy thing on the internet what do you.
Think about sort of media attention yeah.
I don't know i didn't think of that as.
Media attention he was funny people.
Worried about your welfare um no i think.
That's lovely.
But oh the i think it was people started.
To do funny things with that sad keanu.
Obviously side account it was a meme or.
Whatever but it doesn't work in a way.
Because he ah no does have a sad past.
There's his clip on facebook that adds a.
Hundred million views talking about.
Keano sad past.
Music.
You.
You.
Music.
So apparently keanu was born in lebanon.
Okay how many people watch me from.
Lebanon and his father is half hawaiian.
And his name keano means cool breeze on.
A mountain i don't know if that's true.
But that's what he says.
Keanu is such an exotic name but that is.
Your real name.
Yes sir that is my name yes is it from.
Hawaii yes it's a hawaiian name and it.
Means cool breeze over the mountains is.
There anything about this guy that isn't.
Cool.
God damn it sookie oh no leads clearly.
Suffered through a lot it's almost like.
People fetishize his past in a way like.
Oh he's been through so much and a lot.
Of it is kind of exaggerated as well but.
I think what's important is that yes.
He's gone through a lot but he hasn't.
Let that define him or destroy him and.
That's what him is impressive about it.
Number four am i counting correctly his.
Lung okay i looked into his interviews.
And i found this clip and it's so.
Bizarre but sandra bullock she so that.
Was her first big break with you yeah.
And i asked her because everybody had a.
Crush on you.
If she had a crush on you then and this.
Is what she said i think how sweet keanu.
Reeves was and how it was really it was.
Hard for me to like really be serious.
Like he would look at me and i'd be like.
Never dated really there was just.
Something about me.
Not sure i think it's true no he never.
You never intimidated not at all.
Yeah there's nothing to intimidate i'm.
Not that yes you are.
But we're but i think we're probably.
Friends for that long because we didn't.
Yeah right is that how you do it that's.
How i maybe that's why he didn't want to.
Be with you.
And it is reacting to that click look.
How happy is obviously didn't know i had.
A crush on her oh i can't believe you.
Both had crushes on each other and you.
You were so scared okay well i know i.
Mean you ever had a romance with.
Somebody that you did a movie with um.
Sounds like yes i mean whether it's.
Whether it's before or after i mean if.
You wait until it's over.
Sure yeah but that's so that so that.
Chemistry was real because he all really.
Did both have feelings like that yeah it.
Was super sentai dog yeah yeah i mean.
She's so what's such a wonderful person.
No look at this cheap trick's end and.
He's like oh no.
Ici accident i don't want to look.
Goddamn you alan don't do my man piata.
Like this no i believe she's in a.
Relationship now you the window closed.
You you you had a chance you rest.
Assured sandra bullock husband is.
Sweating profusely right now john wick.
Is coming for you.
And then i looked into my fish over this.
The interview of him talking about.
Sandra well they shot this film and it's.
So sweet she has a nice nice such a.
Wonderful energy about her and her in.
Life and she's just wherever she goes.
And she really gives and wants things to.
Be springtime jordan company.
Oh and she's a really great actress too.
No she is no but she is no again i mean.
That the thing that's cool about this.
Film i mean it's cast really very well.
And the actors are really good and you.
Know she's she's brought a very you know.
She's been fighting the the this the.
Direction of just being like you know.
They complete damsel in distress okay.
How do you do not make a move on her.
Keanu jesus christ my god well all of.
This aside pass and the non happening.
Romance this is what led keano into just.
Becoming social class when kioto acts as.
John wick he is john wick okay in every.
Single film he is john wick the matrix.
Training for john wick that love story.
Movie he's still john wick okay he just.
Gotta he's clearly such a badass and.
Have such intense respect for his craft.
Got a reefs really well.
That's funny you can tell keanu really.
Cares about giving you an experience.
That is special in the film and actually.
Putting the work and effort into making.
That happen he does all the action.
Himself or at least as much as he can i.
Love movies gosh i love movies i love.
Watching them and i love making them and.
This brings up to the number 5 which is.
Keanu and money there's this question.
Movies have made so much money three and.
A half billion dollars entertain.
Entertain right yes that's right that's.
Right.
Everyone is so obsessed with money.
Apparently it was reported that he.
Donated 80 million of his 114 million.
Earnings from the matrix sequels i.
Looked around it doesn't seem like it's.
100% true but he definitely is a very.
Giving person he has donated a lot a lot.
Of money and he has also said himself.
That money doesn't mean anything to me i.
Made a lot of money but i want to enjoy.
Life and not stress myself building my.
Bank account i give a lots of way and.
Live simply mostly out of a suitcase in.
Hotels we all know that good health is.
Much more important and i think that is.
An important distinction of how you look.
At the world and how you look at money.
And i and i really really respect that.
Then coming to number five the point.
Number five is counter rives and public.
When he did the matrix it became such a.
Smash hit success that people were.
Obsessed with this film inevitably keanu.
Reeves who is the main star of the film.
I found this quote in an interview where.
He talks about the matrix becoming a.
Cult hit and he says he was asked about.
The film and it was he surprised that it.
Became big and he says yes somewhat i.
Want to make something clear i am not.
Jesus i am also no prophet or lone.
Fighter that will save the world.
I find it frightening how many people.
Believe that being acquainted with me.
Would solve their personal problems.
That's simply not so but i'm.
Participating in the next two matrix.
Films with enthusiasm i don't know if.
He's joking or not or if this is how his.
Life was actually changed that people.
Looked at up to him as some messiah i.
Could be reading into this wrong but it.
Is interesting with the kion owen and.
And the public you know there was his.
Viral clip of him being in the subway.
By the way you're not slick when you're.
Sitting there with your camera like this.
Is this is how you look like by the way.
He clearly just want to live his life.
Like everyone else and i i can't relate.
To that in a lot of ways but when you're.
That famous this is inevitable that.
Paparazzi and living in la you get.
Recognized.
Look how hidden he is we will still find.
Him look how many cameras you know that.
Moment when your bike doesn't start it's.
A bit frustrating imagine being that.
Situation with a dozen cameras pointing.
At you.
And some guy across the street choked it.
You need to choke them but yeah it's.
Like okay got it.
God what an awful situation like if you.
Don't get the bike running what do you.
Do you're just gonna be stuck there with.
All the cameras.
There's my nightmare oh yeah.
Who was that that was john wick he's.
Also very nice with fans which i do.
Appreciate taking selfies.
Please you're one of my favorite doubt.
Music.
Oh you might imagine you're flying.
Across the country you're tired you just.
Want to go home and then you may with.
Which leads me to the final point.
Stop asking keanu reeves for pictures.
Okay.
I'm sure and listen i want to speak for.
Him i'm sure he doesn't mind but i feel.
Like i'm speaking through keanu he just.
Want to live normally and not be stopped.
Every moment okay this is what keanu.
Reeves woods okay anyhow after this.
Video went viral where he says you're.
Breathtaking the guy that yelled you're.
Breathtaking from the audience was.
Offered the game to get it early and he.
Said no thank you.
I would rather if you donate to charity.
Instead so in the spirit of keanu reeves.
And making this video i wanted to donate.
All the profit that this video makes to.
The leukemia research foundation it's.
Working on her donated a lot of money.
Because his sister went through leukemia.
She survived it took my granddad and i.
Thought that could be a nice ending to.
It and have a nice keano effect of doing.
Something good i know everyone once.
Ochio reeves he should be how should me.
Review or whatever that's not why i made.
This video i'm genuinely just fascinated.
By the guy so it doesn't matter okay.
That's it bye what you never played.
Tuber simulator you know it's fun right.
I'm not supposed to give my opinion but.
Give it a try and then you can tell me.

Price.
