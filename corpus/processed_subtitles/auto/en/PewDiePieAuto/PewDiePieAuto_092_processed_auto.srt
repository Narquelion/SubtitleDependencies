Just to see if i can see myself in real.
Life.
Is that autopilot on okay that's pretty.
Good now we can change.
Look at that that was a smooth takeoff.
Hope you enjoyed your flight with.
Pewdiepie airlines so far.
We are on a steady course to sweden over.
The.
British fields apparently i don't even.
Know if we're going to sweden to be.
Honest.
I feel like it's not that direction but.
Who knows.
We'll now be serving snacks protein bars.
And g fuel wait we're not going in the.
Right direction hold up.
Hold up we're a bit off course we'll.
Just stare that way.
There we go it's a little shaky it's.
Gonna be a little shaky because we're.
Adjusting course.
It's fine shakiness is normal shakiness.
Is good get used to it.
Uh we're actually a little we burnt a.
Lot of gas.
So did i forget to remove the flaps how.
Do i.
How do i oh god i got the flaps on oh.
This is terrible.
Why didn't no one tell me about the.
Flaps bro there we go.
Oh that should be smoother what about.
That those flaps are still out.
You're not gonna die you're not gonna.
Die relax.
You're one of those panicky people huh.
We're gonna die there's a little bit of.
Turbulence.
Good betas uh what were they called.
Flaps f13 someone's at f13.
I'm trusting you there's no f13 you.
Control.
That does not exist there we go.
There we go now we're oh that's so much.
Better.
Why did not tell me about that huh all.
Right we're we're fine.
Uh we're going a little fast according.
To this but i think that just means.
We're gonna go.
You guys hear that that's fine that's.
Normal.
Don't listen to him how do we shut him.
Up which button i'm slowing down relax.
We're gonna have to emergency lane at.
The huckfield airport our landing gear.
Is broken there's no reason to be afraid.
My dudes you're in safe hands we're.
Gonna.
Just do a quick little pit stop we're.
Gonna have to lose some people.
Because i think we're too heavy and we.
Don't have enough fuel we actually.
Haven't gone anywhere.
Why is the autopilot so bad as soon as i.
Press the autopilot we just start.
Dying you're in safe hands we're flying.
To sweden and once we're there we're.
Gonna go to the yoyo championship.
Tournament.

Just believe.
With the power of believe we will fly to.
Sweden.
Zero deaths oh you guys didn't know that.
Was just assimilation now it's the real.
Thing.
We had parachutes in the back all the.
Boys jumped out it was epic.

Sake all right we're gonna climb.
A little bit more gamers.
Fasten your seat belts that was a little.
Joke a little practical joke.
We're at 146 so halfway up we gotta.
Double this altitude are you serious.

I gotta climb more.
I'm i'm pulling back ten percent muscle.
Increase there it is.
Damn we're high up    all right this.
Is a little scary.
You may now take off your seat belts.
