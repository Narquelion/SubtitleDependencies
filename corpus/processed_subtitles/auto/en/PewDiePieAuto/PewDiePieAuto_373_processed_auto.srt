Hey hey there is currently construction.
Going on in my office so instead of.
Setting up an awkward camera in my home.
I thought now would be the perfect time.
To do a voiceover video i wanted to talk.
About something that's been on my mind.
For quite a while which is ideas around.
The joker film.
Yes i'm two months late for anyone to.
Still care about this but if you clicked.
Hear me out i wanted to discuss not so.
Much to film itself what's more.
Interesting to me is the reaction to it.
And how it was portrayed and perceived.
By the media and the audience in general.
And now that the time has passed and.
It's sort of come to a conclusion so.
Personally i was very happy when i saw.
The trailer had come out the joker is.
Already a somewhat of a subculture meme.
So this led to excitement for more memes.
But i was mainly excited because it.
Started one of my favorite actors.
Joaquin phoenix which seriously why is.
It not called joachim phoenix english.
Language please i think he's a.
Phenomenal actor and i knew he would fit.
This role just perfectly a quick side.
Note here is that in the previous film.
That featured the joker in in suicide.
Squad the performance was by jared leto.
Which was a questionable display.
And according to the hollywood reporter.
Lleida was fuming over not being casted.
As the new joker in this film and i.
Think it's so funny when people are.
Upset over something they have no right.
To be upset about leto is a good actor.
In all but when you're sending allegedly.
According to him use condoms anal beads.
Live rats threw people on this set i.
Think he is trolling when he says this.
And the rule generally is never go full.
Joker never go full butt when the other.
Stars in the film were asked about the.
Gifts they're clearly very uncomfortable.
Yeah did you get one yes i can't even.
Begin to tell you the weird things i got.
I got a number of gifts to charity so i.
Don't like to talk about i guess that's.
Just what happens when you're so.
Epically immersed in the character of.
The joker on another side note i think.
The fact that jared leto who previously.
Won an oscar contrasting kwok-him who.
Never won one and clearly deserves to.
There's probably many reasons to why he.
Hasn't won one but i think part of the.
Reason why it's because joachim is weird.
I've been meaning to do a video on him.
Just him because i find him very.
Interesting he's the kind of person that.
You don't really know where to place him.
And he clearly enjoys that and plays on.
That but those kind of people are hard.
To attribute awards to and i think.
That's why that's exactly the reason why.
Kwok-him fits so perfectly this role.
Anyway the trailer came up it all looked.
Great people are very excited but the.
Media's reaction slowly started to.
Become weird talking about how joker is.
A dangerous film bringing out the worst.
Of the internet talking about how.
Killing rampage would encourage copycat.
Attacks talking about its dangerous.
Message or insult culture male range the.
List went on it went on so much that.
Todd philip the creator of the film even.
Had to step in and say publicly hey i.
Really think there's been a lot of think.
Pieces written by people who proudly say.
They haven't even seen the movie and.
They don't need to i would just argue.
That you might want to watch the movie.
You might want to watch it with an open.
Mind that's pretty fair.
That you at least watched a film the.
Point here being people were sure this.
Movies somehow glorified insult violence.
Or even white rage was mentioned it went.
So far that even during a press.
Interview with joaquin phoenix and the.
Telegraph they asked phoenix directly.
Are you concerned that the joker might.
Perversely end up inspiring exactly the.
Kind of people it's about with.
Potentially tragic result joaquim.
Walked out and left the interview and he.
Went even worse from here the military.
The us military issued a warning to.
Troops about the premiere event it was.
Almost as if media was bracing for her.
Impact that something bad was gonna.
Happen but then the movie finally came.
Out and surprised it's a movie about.
Mental health unfortunately this didn't.
Change the narrative from media that it.
Was still a dangerous film but i think.
What the movie seemed to have mostly.
Inspired was to have a bunch of kids.
Dancing at a staircase so was it all an.
Overreaction what had spawned many of.
These headlines and concerns came from.
What happened seven years ago in 2012.
Aurora colorado a shooting which took.
Place at a movie theater but it wasn't.
Just any movie theater it was during the.
Dark knight rises the batman film and.
The terrorists had red dyed hair and it.
Was told that the shooter called himself.
Joker.
So maybe the media's criticism over its.
Film's release wasn't unfounded then.
Except this wasn't the truth according.
To the district attorney it never.
Happened.
Colorado officials have attempted to.
Clarify for years that the terrorists.
Never refer to himself as the joker.
Quote the story has persisted because it.
Fits the narrative so cleanly of course.
A crazy haired colored guy who shot up.
The batman premiere thought he was the.
Joker of course and yet it has no.
Connection to reality the narrative.
About the joker association with.
Violence was false.
The film's dark knight was targeted.
Because it was the biggest movie.
Premiering at the time there was nothing.
More to it but despite all the negative.
Press that recent joker film received.
The movie was still a huge success.
Attracting ninety 3.5 million on its.
Opening which is a record for any.
October debit film it became the highest.
Gross all rated film of all time and i.
Saw it.
Maybe the hype ruined it a little bit.
For me but it was a really great film.
I don't think the movies without.
Criticism is my point i'm not what times.
Magazine would call a staunch defender.
Of it but people have been blaming.
Movies games music etc as problems for.
Other people's behavior for decades.
Instead of blaming you know the people.
Themselves hell i've even been blamed as.
Well so why do we do this well it's easy.
Emotions run high it's hard to think.
Rationally you want an easy solution to.
A complex issue but i would argue it's.
Time to be more responsible and look at.
The bigger picture the reality is that.
Hate isn't going to stop existing i'm.
Not gonna pretend that i know how to.
Stop hateful acts from happening but.
There are two things about hate that i.
Do know number one it feeds off.
Reactions this may seem like an obscure.
Example but during world war two in.
Japan there was a big concern by people.
That most of its beautiful and cultured.
And valued structures would get.
Destroyed by the fire bombings i went on.
In kyoto were one of the most beautiful.
Structures resides which is the golden.
Temple was miraculously preserved.
Throughout the war but ironically the.
Temple was destroyed shortly after the.
War ended anyway and it wasn't from any.
War or bombing it was burned down by an.
Arsonist who tried to commit suicide but.
Was caught before and later diagnosed as.
Schizophrenic his motivation was to.
Quote retaliate against society never.
Heard that before right to me it begs.
The question if the concern for the.
Temples protection didn't exist would it.
Still have been burned down society saw.
A likely event as a potential tragedy.
And he came true just not the way they.
Had expected that's why to me the.
Concern for a shooting in a cinema might.
Take place which is by the way a valid.
Opinion to have i'm not saying you're.
Wrong to be concerned about these things.
But it could be potentially a dangerous.
Thing to highlight just so heavily i.
Understand that it's not just one.
Person's fault either for addressing.
What could potentially be an issue with.
A film but since so many articles came.
Out prior to its release without.
Admittedly haven't even seen it it kind.
Of begs the question if it was all just.
Not pure recklessness my second point.
That i know about hate is that it wants.
To be recognized not every time but a.
Lot of times the movie actually depicts.
This accurately an outcast a lot of time.
One attention they want to be heard even.
If it's a dying breath this is i think.
An inherent hey.
Trading people that wouldn't come from.
Any inspirational source just don't give.
It to them arthur in the film was lucky.
To get on television as a platform to.
Get his attention.
By coincidence by raising concern that.
Someone might do something awful you're.
Basically filling a void for someone to.
Step in and take the publicity it's.
Sending a dangerous message to people.
That we are concerned something bad will.
Happen we will platform that bad thing.
If it does happen arthur gets put on.
Television just to be ridiculed this.
Performance on the show is what fully.
Transforms the joker the irony being.
That the media helps create bad people.
While platforming them all while.
Simultaneously thinking they're better.
Than them kwok-him had every right to.
Walk out of that question.
