Knife back it's keith time.
So i actually i don't know if you guys.
Remember way back in the day i did a.
Promo with walking dead and i got to do.
The official walker makeup so they put.
Me like this.
Ask the one they used for this show it.
Was really cool that's basically how i.
Look like exactly like that and they.
Told me that each walker on the show.
Tries to do their signet signature.
Walker move or whatever it looks like.
I'm making fun of something that's not.
Anybody.
God damn it now i just made it worse.
Alright you know what screw it i don't.
Know where it goes i should just stop.
Talking walkers in the other direction.
I saw his eyes when he did it my point.
Was they wanted to be recognized on the.
Show even though they're walker's which.
I thought was kind of cute go.
Also props to everyone for getting that.
Makeup ugh because it took like two.
Hours to get on and then an hour to.
Remove we're safe but not for long damn.
It it's so dark in here we can't move.
Forward without a way to see i'll figure.
Something out.
We can't move forward without a way to.
See can clearly see everywhere okay.
Here's a look oh excuse me.
A crystal freakin crystals and    guys.
We can demand home first are you.
Actually looking for deep core right now.
Pretty hey everything you got a better.
Grade oh maybe we can decorate our.
Chandelier with the grab a steak okay.

Too bad i was busy collecting crystals.
Can't he just do the walker thing and be.
Like hey guys sorry you in here have to.
Kill them i don't want to do that.
Sucks.
So he does recognize that people are.
Better processed i didn't really liked.

Ten please let me know in the comment.
Section down below and i'll be sure to.
Give you guys a like and follow for.
Follow in the comments if you right.
Poopy poop scooping poop.
How is this going to end we don't know.
Aj seeks your approval above all a knows.
You've shaken his confidence in himself.
God kids are so complicated the shores.
That way school is probably that way.
You're just gonna head back to the.
School.
A sim was the third huh the day after aj.
Killed marwan you already know viola and.
I vote for you to stay a sim was a third.
Vote wait that means omar voted us out.
And a ruby uh yeah.
Damn huh what made you think of that a.
Sim said you knew how to survive he.
Could just tell the school would be.
Safer with you there i voted for you.
Because i liked you.
But his reason it was better i just i.
Just thought you should know the sim was.
Right we were who we were more scared.
Than we let on when you met us oh he.
Meant that you were safer that's really.
Nice but he meant the opposite i was.
Like what ha ha it's not a character.
That we're out of danger and climbing.
Back home you just made me think of it i.
Like assume if marlon was still in.
Charge we'd be taken away to wherever or.
Dead instead we fought back because you.
Showed us how we weren't saved with.
Marlon even in his safe zone.
We were just hiding mm-hmm okay that's.
Great honey.
Looks like we're still not safe who was.
It gonna be huh.
Oh.
Music.
That is so great now lou is gonna turn.
Out to be the bad guy who's next.
You're not dead that's good.
Did everyone will come out damn right.
They took clementines back to the school.
I'm here for the emotional look for us.
Never would have forgiven myself if i.
Didn't.
It's over clem the raiders are gone and.
We got everyone out alive ruby said.
Violets eyes aren't affected so that's.
Good too.
They'll all be waiting for us back home.
Any idea which way that is i haven't.
Been out travel but i think there's a.
Bridge no no houses way back let's go.
Mmm how about another way around huh.
What's there not a safer way you imagine.
If they didn't do me sean and instead of.
Doing me sean they do the same season.
But with two vastly different arcs there.
You could go into how freaking cool.
Would that be that would literally shut.
Up all the criticism that these games.
Get about the choices not really matter.
We can live without me sean i mean why.
Do they me sean broke me that's when i.
Realized it's just not as fun as it used.
To be but he magically knew that i'd be.
So cool back on the boat.
Was that your first because you knowing.
At the end of the season.
Yeah two or three it feels you get to.
Pick if you want to stay with ken or not.
You have a tendency to beat yourself up.
Louis it would be cool to keep being.
Able to keep playing with him right back.
Or if you kill and we'll get a different.
Story.
Having a home means defending it that.
Means you can stay with the characters.
That you enjoy or if you don't like you.
Start alone you're gonna die on that.
Boat instead of constantly just.
Resetting always goes through my head.
When that happens my old pet turtle jeff.
My grandma's phone number the word that.
Lost me the fourth grade spelling bee.
Recommend i hate when they fell jeff.
Would joe sorry if that's your name.
Anything new it throws me up every time.

You drew me in and klem naive means you.

When i saw minnie's body for real how.
The walkers left her.

Between my batch and your stump.
We almost make a full pirate are i.
Wanted to wait till you were up and.
About but how i behaved on the boat it.
Was really unfair my head mercer messed.
Up by lily and minnie i was so wrapped.
Up in my own    it's okay he went.
Through hell in that boat and i let that.
Happen.
I'm just glad we got you out of there.
Hey ten let's go play i'm sure tens.
Exhausted aj no it's okay i kind of just.
Feel like playing a little after.
Everything that's happened good you.
Could teach me how you draw so good.
What are you drawing eyes.
But they don't look like they do in my.
Head oh yeah.
Eyes are hard the ears are good i like.
The yellow yeah but you couldn't tell.
They were eyes when you're starting out.
You don't have to get so detail just use.
Shapes like a circle inside a circle.
Works for the pupil.
Yeah you suck well i'm getting tired.
Kiddo mind talking with me before i turn.
In sure.
Gotcha sorry it's okay i stare at it too.
If it was just you and me alone out.
There and i was like this i don't know.
If i'd make it two weeks i'm gonna need.
These to go anywhere and if we ever had.
To run it wouldn't be pretty.
You made it so we don't have to run clem.
We're safe now yeah i guess we are.
Yeah oh this.
It's worth it.
All those times you would ask me if we'd.
Find a home all i could ever tell you.
Was we'll see.
And your face would fall every single.
Time it's better than saying yes and.
Lying to me and that's what i told.
Myself but you want to know something i.
Didn't tell you i never had a plan i.
Never knew where we were going i never.
Knew anything i just bought and fought.
And fought and hoped you didn't notice.
Hope we'd find something before you did.
Did i do a good job.
You tried really hard that's all that.
Matters right it's part of it a big part.
When we were in the barn you didn't.
Listen to me and if you had.
I'd be dead.
I shouldn't have said you weren't ready.
Back in the cave you showed me how wrong.
I was.
You'll have to be strong for the both of.
Us.
You made it so i can hello thank you.
For everything.
You're welcome for everything.
Can we have a star wars ending where.
Everyone comes back just to dance.
Music.
They're walking dead.
What does it say still not been final.
Season is that all the developers doing.
Their signature that's really nice.
The s-sean.
Okay okay in you go.
We can now play okay.
Okay i'll just do that then i don't.
Really know let's explain how this works.
But it still seems like magic.
Music.
And you complain.
Music.
36% said aj wasn't ready interesting.
41% decided to add a skylight who cares.
79% asked 80 to kill you.
Interesting i wasn't sure if that was.
The right choice.
It wasn't it all right.
It's definitely the best episode of the.
Season and i did i feel satisfied with.
That ending although it was very.
Nerve-wracking to say the least.
Again i really appreciate the people the.
Developers finishing this i'm not sure.
Exactly how that happened but i think.
That's great.
And i'm glad it's it had an ending a lot.
Of shows just don't seem to know when to.
Quit.
Obviously they don't have a choice i.
Don't know what i'm trying to say i'm.
Just like i'm glad he's wrapped up and.
It was wrapped up nicely i'll have to.
Say that and it's it's sad looking back.
At how this started this series so long.
Ago look this is the oldest years we've.
Ever done on the on the channel and it.
Kind of ended almost with a resentment.
For a while i was really like angry at.
The game for becoming the way it's done.
But i'm really glad how it ended i.
Thought i was great and i hope you guys.
Enjoyed this very long series if you.
Watch all the episodes props to you and.
Roll we'll move on to another series.
Hopefully in the future that's it for me.
For now goodbye.
