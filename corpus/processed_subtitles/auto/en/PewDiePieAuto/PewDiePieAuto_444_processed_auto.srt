Derrick savage.
Cool cat and his adventures are featured.
In several children's books including.
Cool cat loves karate as well as a new.
Video project called cool cat stops.
Bullying cool cat is holding me at.
Gunpoint cool cat is the greatest movie.
Like how he brought his camera for this.
Event but the shots that he gets of the.
Audience it's just like actually worse.
Quality than my videos it's always so.
Weird to me like this guy clearly tried.
To create some sort of concept you.
Probably put a lot of money and time and.
Effort into it it's you know in a way i.
Feel bad but also cool cat i don't know.
So all the sudden tables are turned here.
That the bullied becomes a bully and.
They added as a trivia character error.
Despite the matter yeah and cool cat.
Said earlier that bullying is bad and.
Shouldn't be done so it done she is.
Later seen bullying butch by making fun.
Of him that he is not invited to the.
House of vivica a fox then all the.
Sudden erik estrada is acting in one of.
The scenes i don't know who he is but.
Apparently he's that he's the guy hey.
Who's that kid no probably want to cool.
