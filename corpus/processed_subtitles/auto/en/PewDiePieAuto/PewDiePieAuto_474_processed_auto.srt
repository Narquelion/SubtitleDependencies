Annoying things youtubers do what's up.
Everyone it's me the least annoying.
Youtuber there is.
I just wanted to ethically rant today.
About some stuff that i noticed.
Youtubers do that is kind of weird.
There's a lot of it that doesn't.
Necessarily get addressed a lot it.
Probably does but regardless i'm gonna.
Go through it and then i'm gonna ask you.
Guys what your pet peeves i guess we can.
Call it our and we'll compare if we have.
The same ok number one this is very.
Specific but i find it as a perfect.
Example of youtubers have no idea what.
They're doing so they're just copying.
Everyone else we have sniper wolf with a.
Tiny tiny bit of red than the in the.
Thumbnail for whatever reason people.
Think this is something worth.
Replicating this tiny bit of red in the.
Background of the photo that's what's.
Gonna get you views apparently people.
Just should i pick any other color than.
This shade of gray red now now it has to.
Be that one oh i tried all other colors.
They don't give use ok sure.
I like how this started as well with.
Sniper wolf and was a z who practically.
Looks so similar anyway and they have.
The exact same thumbnail you know that.
Photo of a human where it's like all.
Faces combined this is gonna be every.
Youtuber eventually what is that yeah.
This is how all youtubers are gonna look.
In the future i know not that important.
Felix no one cares it just showed so.
Much to me alright bringing up the.
Second point which is the description of.
Videos i hate the description of videos.
I don't care about it but it's one of.
Those things as a youtuber you have to.
Write a description because it's so.
Important for people to find your video.
A lot of channels will i mean i don't.
Even know how it works to be honest.
Previously used to be tanks as a way to.
Find a video through searches and it.
Didn't have to be in your face you can.
Just put in a bunch of tags yadda yadda.
Yadda no one cares.
But now everyone just put the same tags.
In every video so you're kind of lost.
This effect so now what youtube wants.
You to do is to write a description in.
Your video and it's so obnoxious look at.
This i mean clearly it works view rise.
But after child well clay made the video.
Spining just rock band signs record deal.
At the product says oracle rose music.
Video goes viral.
By quaint created our regina and pc-9.
Brothers and sister kris my test results.
From upgraded hacker pc 7 1 p 1 5 to.
Reveal sibling true that was a quote ok.
And then you'll upload it quote upgraded.
Hacker defeat it's a way to get all the.
Videos recommended by putting the title.
Of other videos in this one searching.
For technology to destroy projects or go.
On the expulsion project soria youtube.
Channel example project circle member pc.
9 and also named merit started big and.
I've read half of it.
Watch my awesome friend videos know.
They're teaming up now oh no i think.
This annoys me so much because it's it's.
Not about the content it's more about.
How you can optimize your videos in a.
Way that people will be will watch it.
It's loud it grabs attention and people.
Don't question why they watch it it's.
Just there in front of you because it.
Hits every single mark or what youtube.
Is asking for if we click on any video.
That just starts immediately super.
Intensive then it's a it should be.
Assigned to just click off immediately.
You're not gonna get fulfilled from this.
Music.
I'm told by youtube as well that i.
Should write a better description and i.
Just cannot care less i told boohoo.
Right it's just so lame which brings to.
The third point which is youtube.
Thumbnails i mean this has a long.
History back with like i think tobuscus.
And with like same face every single.
Thumbnail for whatever reason having.
Just this face in the thumbnail will.
Will do the trick do you know how.
Annoying it is i'm so sick of it but.
It's so useful for people to know hey.
It's you in the thumbnail you know what.
From now on this is gonna be my.
Thumbnail for every video because that's.
How i feel inside when i make these.
Thumbnails so awful it's so cringy i.
Like this david dobrik one as well just.
Like just mirror the image i can't be.
Bothered.
It's too soul-crushing to take another.
Photo i'll just mirror the photo.
I like that clearly it works no one.
Cares i think after you it's fine but.
After you've done like a thousand of.
These stupid faces in the thumbnail it's.
Like.
I'm done i'm done i'm officially done.
I've done too many number four videos.
That have a question that i could not.
Give less    about but i'll watch the.
Whole thing and i'm thoroughly enjoyed.
It always annoys me like i've learned a.
Lot but i will never need to know this.
It's the world running out of helium i.
Don't care but it was a great video okay.
I want to see what shows up if i search.
Why why costco is cheaper than amazon i.
Don't care just don't click on it felix.
You clearly don't understand my.
Impulsive habits that i can't control.
Okay why joe rogan won't do hot ones i.
Mean i want to know but i'm sure the.
Answer is pretty unimportant why planes.
Don't fly i don't care stop stop roping.
Me into questions that i don't care.
About stop giving me knowledge and stuff.
I don't like it it needs to end what is.
His budget v socks why doesn't the heart.
Get tired i don't care i don't care i.
Don't care.
Stop asking questions in your titles i.
Don't care i don't care do i have to say.
It more why your aim still sucks i don't.
Want to know i don't want to know i.
Found this when i accidentally clicked.
On this video and it's number five.
Pointless or rewards for videos no.
Daniel or regina the winner will get.
Oh cool why it's almost like this night.
You need to know you can't just do.
Anything now there has to be like 10.
Grand on the line or something when.
There gets 5 billion and they're never.
Satisfied in the end when they win.
They're like oh cool this is awesome.
It's the same video regardless it's not.
Like it's amping up anything but oh my.
God they win ten thousand so i have to.
Watch the video and see what their.
Reaction is reaction alright cool thanks.
What are you gonna do with this i'll.
Maybe pay off student loans okay cool so.
Many youtubers do this now with like pay.
Ten thousand pay ten thousand all right.
Don't get me wrong i think people can do.
It right and a lot of people do but it's.
One of those concept that clearly works.
On youtube and everyone just take that.
Concept and they do it so lazily lazily.
Is that a word i don't know what did i.
See recently oh yeah morgues does that.
In line last two life wins twenty.
Thousand it's like it's like the bank.
Gives out loans to its elves yeah i won.
Twenty thousand from my own money that's.
Awesome cool number six.
I think i'm we're up to six likes on the.
Screen it's the thing that's happening.
Now and it's one of those things where i.
Makes me feel so    old leave a.
Like liked subscribe cool the video just.
Began why stop it i get it it's like a.
Way less intrusive way to get people to.
Like the video this is another one of.
Those things that clearly works and.
Everyone just does it and now it's a.
Standard and it's just annoying and i.
Don't like it.
Boomer this is a boomer wrenched by you.
To basically which brings me into the.
Next one is when a lot of times you'll.
Watch like a video just to understand.
How to do something an instruction video.
And for whatever reason they'll still.
Tell you okay maybe it's like how do you.
Fix how do you download this app on your.
Phone or something stupid i don't know.
And by the end that i follow me on.
Instagram guys no no i'm not gonna.
Follow you in instagram i mean i could.
Just ignore you saying that but why.
Would i know your place if you make text.
Tutorials then maybe people don't give a.
About your instagram jesus christ.
The same with podcast everyone has a.
Podcast now this is such an epic rant.
Why does that noah.
Not everyone hates a podcast if they're.
Sitting on problem number what are we on.
Eight or nine.
It doesn't matter red shadow legends.
Have you guys heard about raid shadow.
Legends but don't take my word for it.
Take all the reviews that are it has.
5-meter million reviews and they're all.
5.9 average and her weight if you.
Download now you get 50,000 gold.
Whatever that means and you can also.
Read shadow legend with me maybe you can.
Find me in the game if you play an.
Average shadow legends listen i'm not.
Gonna hate on people getting bright on.
Youtube i think it's great but for the.
Sake stop everyone that does raid shadow.
Legend shoutouts it's the same script.
For everyone they've literally just said.
Okay you need to say all these things.
And then every raid shadow legend shout.
Out sounds exactly the same it is so.
Annoying what's this the most immersive.
Rpg experience you'll find on a.
Smartphone its most immersive experience.
Your final smartphone i bought another.

Ad sponsored gifted gamer red shadow.

Class and play game and graphic good.
Alright.
Those were my pet peeves about youtube.
Do you agree with them do you not let me.
Know in the comments i'm not gonna read.
Them anyway i'm kidding i do read.
Comments okay so i asked them twitter.
What your pet peeves are about youtubers.
Which i think it's pretty interesting so.
Let's see talking super slow and it's.
Noticeable they're trying to make the.
Video longer.
Some people on youtube speak so slow.
I always watch videos on times to speed.
And some people speak so slow that even.
Times to makes the video dreadfully slow.
This is a problem with youtube in.
General that youtube ones longer videos.
So people drag them out for no reason at.
All and it's very obnoxious i can't say.
That i'm entirely guilt free on this but.
I've seen the worst examples and it.
Blows my mind that people are okay with.
It they never really help small.
Youtubers oh i remember when i used to.
Do that remember that and then people.
Started calling me nazi for it it's epic.
That this is why i don't do good things.
Any more unnecessary interest and.
Background information yes this is don't.
Care about your car accident that left.
You without a left head just show me.
That a clean bird so here's the tutorial.
On how to fix your makeup eckel also.
Guys sorry about the background already.
In this video we got a little bit of.
Construction going on outside hope that.
Isn't too annoying for you guys in the.
Background anyway also when they have a.
Camera for three years can't the relate.
Can't relate to this at all i also think.
That i know this is kind of a stupid.
Argument to make but when people get too.
Polished of a setup like a studio and.
And like super crisp quality camera and.
And their everything is amazing which is.
Nice don't get me wrong and they fit.
Certain channels but it almost feels.
Like you kind of lost touch with what in.
My opinion youtube is when it's too.
Polish it's almost like i know it makes.
No sense to say i don't know it's like.
I'm justifying me being a cheap ass and.
Not buying a proper camera alright it's.
Not a pet peeve really but chorded big.
Digital put an ad timer in their videos.
If i want to watch an ad and i can and.
If i don't want to i can skip to exactly.
Where the video ends more youtube.
Versity should do that a great way to is.
To if you're on your phone you can just.
Double tap on the side of the screen.
Most ad reads are either 60 to 90.
Seconds.
So you just doubletap six times and if.
Their ad is still going double tap three.
Times and you're good to go.
You're welcome gamers starting a podcast.
There it is for no reason i don't know.
Why that annoys you so much i like.
Podcast as much as the next guy but why.
Don't half the people i follow feel like.
They need to have their own aimless.
Podcast i ain't got time for that i like.
This because clearly you can just ignore.
It you don't have to consume the podcast.
It doesn't hurt you in any single way at.
All but it still annoys me i am still.
Bothered by it this does not affect me.
Whatsoever but i'm still very bothered.
By it stop it i don't like it.
Skip over really important items in bit.
On video games well when you're doing.
Commentary and you're focused on keeping.
It interesting it is hard to play away.
As you do when you just watch a video.
And you just it is different i remember.
When i play with friends and and one.
Person has to control it it's so much.
Easier to be like you missed that you.
Missed that you missed that i get that.
It's still annoying but yeah i don't.
Know talking over dialogue in games well.
It's that dialogues weren't so boring.
Jesus christ i gotta say as someone that.
Has played insane amount a story-driven.
Horror and sorry story driven games most.
Game developers aren't writers and the.
Writers that game developers hires are.
So bad they cannot write it can't it's.
Awful and he just feels like you're.
Having your time wasted i remember.
Watching the documentaries of the of the.
How they made the halo cutscenes and i.
Find it's so interesting how they kept.
Revision doing it it's a really good.
Service if you watch actually how bungie.
Did the original halo games because.
Their approach to storytelling in the.
Cutscenes were we are wasting people's.
Time we need to make this as interesting.
As we possibly can and i think that is.
Missed on a lot of games it just feels.
Like they need to drag out the game to.
Be as long as possible which kind of.
Ties into youtube in a sense asking.
People to like and subscribe to their.
Channel ten seconds into the video this.
Is one of those things that just doesn't.
Go away because it clearly works despite.
How cannabis it is i remember when i.
Started doing youtube videos and i felt.
Awful just asking for subscribing at the.
End watch it watch some of my earlier.
Videos i'm like if you've made it this.
Far in the video then maybe consider.
Subscribing and i remember i remember.
Like getting like two or three more.
Subscribers because i used to do that.
I'm like holy    i found a gold mine.
Subscribeto pretty recorded videos maybe.
It's just me but i don't like the vibe.
Of pre-recording yeah i get this a lot.
Since i do daily videos why don't why.
Can't you just work ahead or why can't.
You just do that i really don't like it.
Either i think it shows immediately when.
A video is pre-recorded and it makes it.
Less interesting in a sense i don't know.
Why cuz it's such a subtle thing i only.
Really work ahead if i have no other.
Choice leave your opinion in the.
Comments below.
Never reads comments this actually.
Reminds me of another thing i always.
Read the comments i think i think it's.
Super fun if i don't care about the.
Comments it probably means i don't care.
About the video i just created to be.
Honest so i think it's a good way to.
Know if you made an interesting video or.
Not i first thought the whole like a.
Common thing was interesting but now i.
Just find it a really annoying way for.
Youtubers to shell-like positive.
Comments because they all get bumped i.
Wish i could like a comment without it.
Getting bumped up because now it's like.
I want to find out what people thought.
Of a video like what the actual.
Democracy opinion of ideas are but then.
I have to feel like i have to scroll.
Through yeah there's a surgeon out.
Problems i am aware but it's like i have.
To scroll past all these like like the.
Creator like comments to get what two.
People are actually saying do you.
Understand what i mean so that's why i.
Find myself not even using this feature.
Another one makes a 15 to 20 minute rant.
About some other creator how much they.
Hate their content and despite their.
Views and then say please don't send any.
Hate as it ends as if that's gonna stop.
The hate well it's kind of annoying as a.
Creator how you can't criticize another.
Channel without a lot of dumb idiots.
Following along and just taking it too.
Far so it's almost like you have to say.
It even though it's not gonna have any.
Effect i think that's another pet peeve.
I have too is like these channels that.
Are purely based around calling out.
Other channels that's all they do and.
Then they get called out and it's and.
It's the biggest drama ever how could.
They say this about me but i think you.
Have a point here with this cuz it's.
Like you're creating this atmosphere on.
Youtube where it's being overly critical.
And and things like that putting more.
Emphasis that being overly critical is.
Important when it really isn't oh god.
I'm a giant hypocrite.
Starting an interesting sentence about.
Themselves or their own life experience.
Then gets distracted and then they never.
Finished and finished sin.
Yeah going on tangent is something i see.
A lot of youtubers do especially when.
You're new because you think it's like a.
Quirky way to speak but it's just really.
Really really really annoying if i ever.
Go on a tangent you may have noticed.
This i always acknowledge that i go on a.
Tangent just so people know that yes i.
Am aware this is a different topic but i.
Will get back to the point later a.
Little tip there for newbies and i'm.
Working on something really excited but.
I i can't tell you yet yes the.
Announcement of it the announcement.
That's always very interesting just shut.
The    up then i hope i haven't done.
This i don't think i do.
Doing too much of it at once and i can.
Lie but pushing games merch and hardware.
And drinks and figures and a sponsor all.
In one video it's kind of much in one.
Video i think with games i have another.
One coming out poopd on 12 of december i.
Don't give a    if you have a problem.
With it games is really hard to time.
With other things a lot of times you're.
Working with different people in it i.
Mean it is fair criticism but at the.
Same time games specifically it's very.
Hard to time say might seem like oh.
You're pushing a lot right now but it's.
Literally just a coincidence and i think.
It's cool stuff too like i don't know i.
Don't care when they try to act poor as.
Familiar i can relate to someone working.
Two jobs and living paycheck to paycheck.
It like some of them hi there well i.
Mean meanwhile we're all aware of it i.
Think it makes it worse when they try to.
Hide it and relate to us to some level.
Yet see this a lot youtubers obviously.
Pop off i think it's less than obnoxious.
Than shoving it in your face we'd like.
Look at the car look at the house wait.
And when that becomes your content.
That's a lot more annoying than trying.
To hide your wealth but i also think a.
Lot of youtubers are scared of showing.
That they have money to lose that sort.
Of connection with their audience and.
That's what people do it when i think in.
Reality it doesn't matter what level you.
Are on as long as you're honest about.
What you're doing and can express what.
Your fears are people will still.
Understand it even if they can't relate.
To it i'll really complain about youtube.
And how bad it is to point where it's.
Not just venting their frustration.
Anymore it's very tense of complaining.
For no reason.
You have a great house expensive.
Equipment and an amazing car like a stop.
I actually disagree with this to a.
Certain extent because i think i find.
Myself being more critical about things.
That i care about and that doesn't mean.
I think it's all bad but it's it's.
Things that i think can make improve.
It's just giving constructive criticism.
Or pointing out things that i'm annoyed.
With because i really care about you to.
Me if i bribed by youtubers because i'm.
I really want you to do well but i think.
It's small things right i think the.
Thing with youtube is said eventually.
Because it's ridiculous to care about.
These tiny little promise all people are.
Stupid thumbnails and blah blah blah all.
These all these things they don't mean.
Anything by themselves but after year.
After year after year after year.
Each progression of all these things i.
Think we'll find it maybe it's not.
Entirely possible that we find ourselves.
Looking at a youtube that has been.
Shaped in a way that we don't want it at.
All and i think that's my concern when.
Addressing these things not so much each.
Like i couldn't give a less    about.
What someone uses i said thumbnail well.
Yeah that's my youtube pet peeves.
Do you agree disagree i read the comment.
Actually that's a lie.
Actually no it isn't like i got it you.
Know when everyone's spanned the.
Comments and it's the same one i just.
Sort by knew all right that's how i read.
The comments you're not slick okay all.
Right that's it.
Bye-bye.
Music.
You are entering a new era where you.
Shall craft thy own.
The hour of our spells and poop grades.
Is coming marzia edgar and buttons need.
You.
The timer you will face but crawlers is.

Throne bertie is the game to play i'm.
Not supposed to have my opinion about.
That but the prizes.
Music.
