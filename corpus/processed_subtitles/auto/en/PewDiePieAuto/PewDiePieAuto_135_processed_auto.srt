Hello it's time for me to share one of.
My most.
Deepest darkest saddest.
Stories that i ever held inside and not.
Told.
Anyone in over 15 years.
That's right i broke my ass.
It's not something i'm proud of and i'm.
Only making this video.
To make sure that this happens to no one.
Else.
I was young i was foolish and this could.
Happen to anyone do you know where your.
Ass is right now.
You have to be aware at all times.
Otherwise.
You run the risk of experiencing.
The same pain i did long long long ago.
I'm making this video because i made a.
Promise in a video a couple years ago i.
Said.
I admitted that i broke my ass i'll tell.
People in the future about this story.
And i finally gathered enough courage i.
Finally gathered enough strength.
To tell my story about how i broke my.
Ass.
Music.
I'm really appreciative people.
Gave me their respect and support for.
Doing this.
It's not easy to talk about.
But i will do my best to stay strong.
Throughout this video.
Music.
When i was 15 in sweden i was an awkward.
Swedish.
Weird underdeveloped little child.
That's right everyone i used to be the.
Short kid you think i'm insecure about.
My height for no reason.
This has nothing to do with the story.
I'm just giving context i didn't like.
Interacting with people i would prefer.
To just sit home and play video games.
I know the perfect cliche of a nerdy kid.
Nevertheless during summer we didn't.
Have a computer.
At our summer place i had completely.
Different friend group there.
There was basically internet was.
Non-existent so.
I had no other choice but to hang out.
And socialize with people.
So even though i was a weird awkward kid.
Two months a year i.
Became a normal swedish boy i became a.
Summer child.
And actually went out partying and did.
All the stuff you do.
So one week during the summer there's a.
It's called sailing week i think.
Where everyone or a lot of people rent a.
Boat.
They go sailing and they go from harbor.
To harbor.
And they get drunk and party so.
Me and my friends rented a sailing boat.
Altogether.
Well i think i think i was 50. i don't.
Know exactly how old i was.
But me and my uh two closest friends we.
Rented a boat to.
Do basically just this i don't know why.
My parents thought this was a good idea.
I definitely would not let my kids do.
This especially.
Mine with what we did i'm not gonna go.
Into details but i know what you're.
Thinking wow felix you have so many.
Amazing talents.
You must be really good at sailing oh.
Yeah i was actually a sailing instructor.
At one point.
Not really i mean i was a sailing.
Instructor but i was goddamn awful at.
Sailing.
I really just got the job thanks for my.
Mom thanks mom i remember uh.
During the so it was basically me and a.
Bunch of really young kids.
And then during the beginning of the.
Course we asked like who wants to stay.
Up with felix and all the kids when yeah.
Me me me and i'm like yay i'm finally.
Popular with kids.
Kids like me this is great and then at.
The end of the course.
They ask the same question who wants to.
Stay with felix today.
No one complete silence no one wanted to.
Say it with me all the kids hated me.
Because i wasn't good at sailing and we.
Kept capsizing and i kept lashing out on.
All the kids because they sucked at.
Sailing and how is that my fault i'm.
Just the instructor.
I also won one sailing uh.
Competition once which wasn't really a.
Sailing competition but it's one of.
Those things that i carried with me.
Throughout these 15 years and go.
Yeah i'm good at sailing i'm not good at.
Sailing and i'm willing to admit that.
Nevertheless we went sailing me and a.
Couple friends and it was a great time.
We we partied and that was it.
The problem is i get really really.
Really motion sick or seasick and anyone.
That gets seasick you know how awful it.
Is it.
Stays with you until you get out of the.
Boat.
It doesn't leave you for all this time.
And it seems impossible to get rid of.
You just want to die and it's not a good.
Feeling i didn't like the feeling.
So i thought okay i'm gonna come.
Prepared.
So i bought this motion sickness tablet.
Which is supposed to help with it.
But they came with two side effects that.
I was not intending for.
Number one it made me extremely sleepy.
For some reason we had these weird.
Regulations in sweden where.
With drugs i guess we don't really have.
Sleeping pills like in america.
A lot of times what doctors do is that.
Instead of giving you sleeping pills.
They say hey just take these motion.
Sickness tablets they do the same thing.
And i didn't know about this so i.
Remember one time one of the days.
During the sailing week it was so stormy.
Outside i remember looking outside be.
Like oh my god i'm gonna die from.
Seasickness if i go out on this.
So i just downed a bunch of these motion.
Sickness tablets.
Being like it's not gonna happen to me.
Yeah i basically just drugged myself as.
Hard as i could.
Completely passed out i don't know how.
Long i was out but i remember.
I was waking up way later in the evening.
Being super confused i didn't know where.
I was.
I looked outside i thought we arrived in.
The new harbor realizing.
We didn't even leave the shore everyone.
Was too afraid to sail that day.
So i basically just drugged myself for.
No reason but felix we want to hear how.
You broke your ass well i'm getting.
There.
Okay papa needs some watch time there's.
Another symptom.
That i haven't mentioned yet and that.
Symptom is balance.
That's right motion sickness is.
Connected to your ear.
Which is connected to your balance so i.
Would say or at least i like to think.
That that's why my balance wasn't the.
Pristine.
Top condition that it's usually in i can.
Stand on one leg probably longer than.
Any other.
Person alive i pride myself in having.
Extremely well balanced.
In everything thanos catchphrase.
Perfectly balanced as all things should.
Be.
Was actually invented by me i have.
Amazing balance.
But taking these pills it knocked over.
My balance.
Then we were also on this boat drinking.
Obviously as we were sailing.
And that knocked down a few points on my.
Balance.
Scale as well and i think you know where.
I'm going.
With this sometimes when you sit down in.
A sailing boat.
It's a little bit awkward to sit down in.
A sailing boat they're kind of weirdly.
Shaped so.
It's not always the perfect place to.
Place your butt there's also a lot of.
Big objects.
A lot of hard objects.
That you could possibly fall on i was.
Gonna sit down.
Everything was fine it was a beautiful.
Sunny day we were all drinking.
Beer alcohol-free of course i was gonna.
Sit down.
And i remember it so vividly i can.
Replay the whole scenario.
In slow motion i was gonna sit down and.
I was gonna grab my friend.
While sitting down because like i said.
It's awkward sitting down in a sailing.
Boat so i was gonna get help from my.
Friend to sit down.
But this son of a gun moved away.
In last second and i remember.
So clearly just.
Falling out of my grass my hands knowing.
Oh god whatever my ass is gonna land on.
It's not gonna be beautiful and let me.
Tell you it wasn't beautiful.
I landed on a bench i don't know what.
That's called in english.
It's basically what you rail in the.
Sails with and it's pretty much as.
Uncomfortable.
As you can imagine oh it's called winch.
In english okay i screamed out.
In terror in pain in shock.
My ass ah my ass i was completely.
Immobilized.
I couldn't move but most importantly i.
Was in deep.
Deep pain it really hurts to break your.
Ass i wasn't sure exactly what had.
Happened.
But i knew something was wrong so me and.
My friend as soon as we entered.
We came to shore we came to harbor we.
Had to go to the hospital.
We did the scan to confirm that yes.
Indeed.
There was a crack in my ass.
I didn't no longer just had one crack in.
My ass i had two cracks in my ass and.
That was.
One crack too many to have let me tell.
You i remember feeling very shocked.
About this it was.
A very traumatizing experience and.
Realization and i wasn't sure what they.
Were gonna do with me.
How do you treat a cracked ass i thought.
Maybe.
They would give me some sort of a.
Bandage kind of like a diaper or.
Something like that.
And i remember asking the nurse what are.
You gonna do and she's like well we.
Can't vanish your ass can we and i.
Thought yeah i guess you can.
You live and you learn so instead they.
Just gave me a bunch of painkillers.
And sent me off even though i had broken.
Eggs you know usually when you.
Break something i never actually broke.
In anything in my body.
So i was actually kind of looking.
Forward to it because everyone.
You know when they're a kid they break.
An arm they break a leg or whatever and.
Everyone's like oh it's so sad for you.
And they get all this attention.
They get people riding on your bandage.
And no one's gonna ride on my.
Bandage ass bandage i realize all i have.
To deal with.
Is the pain and suffering and most of.
All the humiliation.
You break an arm it's cool you break an.
Ass.
It's not cool no one thinks that's cool.
No one is proud to say.
Hey i broke my ass okay do you think i.
Want to be here.
You think i want to tell this story.
Think again now the worst part of all.
Is that jonas jonas if you're watching.
This video you sneaky son of a snake.
Jonas the guy that moved away when i was.
Trying to sit down while i was at the.
Hospital with my other friend.
Aegis good friend at least that doesn't.
Tell people.
Jonas told everyone he told everyone.
That i had broken my ass and everyone.
Laughed.
Ha ha that's so funny i couldn't sit.
Straight.
For god knows how long i was in pain.
I was humiliated i was hurt.
Don't break your ass take it from me.
Take good care of it.
Music.

Happen to it.
