Are you an introvert or an extrovert.
Today we're gonna find out who's the.
Fake introvert i'm really excited to.
Watch this video because i find a lot of.
Times i talk to people and they're like.
Oh yeah i'm totally introverted i love.
Like sitting home and watching movie.
I would consider myself both introvert.
And extrovert yes that's a thing i feel.
Like you can tell sometimes when i make.
Videos with other people it's incredibly.
Awkward but sometimes i can do stuff on.
Stage and it's so epically natural.
Applause.
Music.
Six introvert one secret extrovert let's.
Freakin go you believe i'm gonna what.
It's like discover supplier does already.
Passed right the life spies he or she.
Wins the entire fries i don't like how.
They can lie but i guess that's the.
Point.
Silent round it's okay.
Oh so actually get to thanks me everyone.
Those introverts can't talk they cannot.
Communicate what are they saying here.
That's so weird.
I wonder how people react today you.
Really don't stereotype introvert also.
You believe silent fun fact did you know.
Introvert can actually talk normally.
Likes okay let's watch what is he doing.
It's making me uncomfortable.
Who's the surrogate this is what.
Introverts do all they put a bunch of.
Introverts in a room this is the result.
I feel like that's a misconception where.
At least in my experience i feel like.
I'm comfortable with silence and a lot.
Of people aren't especially in america i.
Found that the conversations with.
Americans are just like bam bam bam bam.
Bam bam bam and it's like oh i have to.
Fill the void with something to talk to.
Otherwise it's awkward but in reality i.
Don't think it is and i find that a lot.
Of times when people idolize mean like.
Podcast and suffer like them but oh so.
Awkward it was quiet for a second like.
To me it's more awkward when you're.
Trying to force a conversation just my.
Opinion and also very boring i'd rather.
Be quiet okay this is making me angry.
And we're only in halfway stylet rapping.
Music.
Why is he not looking at her it's so.
Weird okay i guess we have to judge just.
Like base on appearance if i had to base.
Just some appearance she seems remote.
Introverted maybe these two as well i.
Don't know her i don't know.
Did you notice that notice these two.
Making eye contact she pull away right.
Away she's clear she's clear okay we had.
To clear so far all right i want to see.
More who if anyone else did they hey.
She's been cleared to actually i don't.
Know because i just felt like everybody.
Was like trying to look into my soul and.
Like determine if i was an introvert or.
Not okay so you guys voted the one in.
The middle.
Interesting interesting all right fair.
So they vote right away just based on.
That what i really appreciate that what.
Is it called the nature a grasshopper.
Sound really two fully fully extend the.
Awkwardness all right so everyone thinks.
Ant won races physically or the way bike.
Mannerisms are i come off as an.
Extrovert.
Yeah expect it yeah he does seem bad i.
Think it's funny too because you put a.
Bunch of introverts.
In a box and expect them to be like you.
Know taking people out and it's like nah.
We're not you don't do that.
Did you know introverted people can talk.
All right let's see it this is very what.
I guys like to do my wing is her have.
Free time for yourselves i like to watch.
Tip talk take my dog to the dog park.
Stuff like that she likes to watch nick.
Talk yeah she looks like the part at.
Least how does it make you an introvert.
Does it i don't think it does i feel.
Like she dressed up as hot this is how.
An introvert looks like my energy and i.
Gain energy from having a long time and.
Being able to recharge.
Okay fair.
There that's true go back to a place.
Where i can interact with people.
No every time i'd like to paint.
Sometimes like go the beach or hike yeah.
I really like running and hiking like.
Spending time in nature this is a bit.
Confusing because i feel like she's.
She's speaking very extroverted lee i.
Would say very i feel like someone that.
Goes on this show too high that they're.
An introvert would not say something.
Like that you know what i mean they.
Wouldn't say something that would seem.
More extroverted like going outside am i.
Right.
They would be like oh i like to sit home.
And yeah yeah well i look like watch now.
She's clay also like writing as well.
It's like kind of like my creative.
Outlet sure you're clear alex next is.
Like chilli i just do watch like youtube.
Videos what i'm not doing anything.
See what i mean see what i mean that's.
What a fake aim to it i just like to sit.
Home and i like a video game a bit my.
Didn't live and it hurts every time i.
Thought it'd be like nobody bothered me.
Nobody i'd knock on my door.
Yes my strategy going into the game was.
Just like maybe pick up on like the way.
That people were like standing or like.
Just the way people held themselves and.
They came across as more like confident.
Or more sure of themselves introverted.
People can't be confident it's just.
Completely impossible.
I guess it's such a broad thing everyone.
Is different at the end of the day.
Prefer like calling or like texting.
People taxi come on what kind of.
Question is that of course everyone.
Listen introverted prefers texting you.
Can think of what you're gonna say and.
Tell me they're gonna call me i think i.
Did talk a lot at first because i was.
Trying to just say something so i wasn't.
Voted off too early what do you guys.
Think is like the heart.
Part of being an introvert meeting new.
People like fair kind of opening myself.
Up.
I've been let's go for like five years.
My only friend is like my friend from.
High school.
So like didn't work yeah that seems.
About accurate i can i can relate to.
That meeting new people who has time for.
That anyway let's get real here for me.
Like giving futures and like public.
Speaking oh my god a speech yesterday in.
My class naco haha no one likes public.
Speaking no one doesn't matter if you're.
Extra verdean to hurt and while i'm like.
Oh i love to speak and run to these.
People that no one lice who saw no i.
Just freaked out like for me it's like.
In large group settings feeling.
Overlooked or like not considered since.
I'm not immediately like vocal about all.
My opinions and stuff something i'm.
Thinking about it and like composing my.
Thoughts and want to say stuff but you.
Know sometimes in those situations like.
Everyone talks over and then the moment.
Goes away i'm not like this but i know.
Other people that are introvert that i.
Told me that they feel like this so.
She's safe safe so far i don't trust the.
Girl with the dirty jeans broken jeans.
And the girl with the flower skirt those.
Two do not trust.
It's a do we tie between emma and maya.
Wait seriously they vote out emma after.
She gave like the most perfect answer.
About what you guys don't deserve money.
Introverts don't deserve money i'm gonna.
Say it.
You know introvert these are poor.
Friendly and bubbly and that maybe you.
Came across as like outgoing so they may.
Be pinpointed me for that i can see that.
I can see that are we starting you guys.
Ever done any like the personality test.
Well those are guys like that's a good.
Question what is that like the advocate.
Yeah but it's turbulent in sweden we.
Have a saying yesterday your glory.
Muslin it means i suspect owls in them.
In the marsh and i'm like i'm expecting.
A lot of house in the mosque right now.
Somebody's like talking about like i.
Ever i don't know the order i was.
Seriously clueless so i thought i was.
Gonna be out once they started doing.
That so like what do you guys think you.
Struggle with the most with being like.
An introvert like i was like miss.
Consumption yeah cause like that's what.
I'm you know i don't know where it's i.
Would say for maybe they just assume not.
Like i hate people like i've been told a.
Lot that i seem intimidating at first.
Since i'm so like reserved and i have.
Like my show i like the reason i brought.
It up is because like a lot of people.
Assume like i'm not confident i'm like.
They're like oh you just need to be a.
More outgoing and i'm like i'm really.
Confident myself like i know who i am.
But that doesn't mean like i can't be.
Introverted at the same time okay that's.
Fair you like to complete her me yeah.
Everybody's on a spectrum.
So they sure are well are in a hundred.
Percent in.
Or a hundred percent an extrovert we all.
Have like tendencies of both because no.
I think that relates to me a world we're.
Like somebody's a hundred percent one.
Thing i actually do talk a lot like with.
Like my close friend like a family but.
Like outside like social public places i.
Like a more reserved.
True-true that's a giving that's a given.
Determine factor i feel like extroverted.
People cannot shut the f--- up about.
Around people they just met introverted.
People only really talk when they they.
Know and aren't comfortable with someone.
Is that correct i feel like i'm correct.
About that i'm basing all of this on.
Americans basically because every time i.
Go in america every wants an extra to.
Feel safe like why is everyone talking.
To me stop talking to me stop it maybe.
I'm just your opinion it's such a.
Difference though you talk to a stranger.
Here it's like what what are you doing.
We don't we don't do that you talk to.
Someone america i'll be like oh it was.
Strangers - i just like yeah yeah same.
Like i feel like i need my energy.
It's my i'm sorry like you were saying.
To think that like we're boring people.
You know cuz we can have fun but it just.
Depends on who we're with so well that.
Means you're boring around people that.
Think that you are boring around doesn't.
Mean i'm really funny i swear i just.
Have fun with other people i'm not.
Boring i feel that i'm like really.
Emotional like with my close friends i.
Like let all of it out but then with.
People i'm not what the hell is.
Happening it's starting red well okay.
It's time to vote alright who would you.
Vote based on this be honest i will vote.
Flower same same i really think these.
Strongly that these three are safe these.
Two i don't know i would still vote her.
I voted for alex because i could see him.
At a party like having fun he just kind.
Of had a bubbly.
Music.
Introverts cannot have fun at parties.
Impossible i see what you mean but yeah.
That sounds really funny introverts go.
To party and they cry they cry every.
Time dan they were too mad huh i'm like.
Surrounded by other introverts i'll.
Notice i'll be the ones that just kind.
Of like step up and talk more so i think.
Maybe people saw that i was being like.
That was a little bit more comfortable.
Within the group so they kind of saw.
That as maybe like an extrovert i.
Continue continue while the confidence.
So maya thinks for sure that she knows.
Everyone is out interesting.
Thank you dean how do you guys go about.
Dating it's hard i have a girlfriend but.
We're both introverts and we're both.
Really independent we know like when to.
Give each other space like we know that.
It doesn't mean that we don't care or.
Love each other less it just means like.
We need a recharge like we don't have to.
Constantly talk all the time and like.
Really that's very that's very hard i.
Need to put myself out there more cuz.
I'm like i want to date you know like i.
Want to find somebody but at the same.
Time it's just that like meeting up part.
And like alright my you're a liar you're.
A liar you're stinky liar potato liar.
Knock down yeah you know no i don't know.
Are you saying okay well i usually don't.
Approach people but like when i get.
Approached i kind of have about how to.
Like go scene or just like 20 minutes.
Before i'm like sorry i can't right i'm.
Going to right all right i swear i swear.
Liar i like being able to be to myself.
And do what i want on my free time.
Without anybody getting offended of why.
I don't want them around you know so.
Yeah truth truth i relate to this so.
Much i need my space.
I don't know i really don't know someone.

Just seemed very calm to me.
As for boasting everyone else they seem.
More nervous and kind of anxious you.
Guys still with like anxiety did you.
Tonight guys not heard from jake paul.
Anxieties in real what do you say what.
Are you talking about do you guys have.
Like a method for anxiety like how to.
Calm down anxiety anxiety that's not how.
You say it.
Learn to speak maya go back to speaking.
School i'm still looking for one okay i.
Have a really hard time like coming down.
When i'm really anxious so it's like.
Hard for me because i shot down.
Completely like i can't talk or anything.
When i'm really anxious so it's mostly.
Like just me sitting and like staring at.
A wall yeah for me it's like music or.
Just kind of like deep breathing.
Yeah same like the way i go to sleep.
Because i have like insomnia like i.
Can't go to sleep and so like i'll play.
Like the meditation music on youtube and.
It kind of just like mellows me out.
Because i overthink a lot and that's.
What keeps me up at night.
There's nothing to do with introvert but.
I feel like people with inner vert it's.
Like what i said about kingdom hearts.
People with introvert cannot shut the up.
About their anxiety i'm just kidding i'm.
Joking i'm joking that was too hard.
They voted her out damn it look like i.
Guess i would have done the same out.
There yeah yeah it's your life surround.
That people would vote me off just off.
Of the first look but i was surprised.
That i stayed so long.
Okay i think they're done vibes they.
Passed the vibe check okay all right.
Here's the moment of truth who is it.
Going to be i bet it was the first guy.
They got him right away or something.
What i mean.
Recent last round and losing was really.
Heartbreaking i was pretty upset because.
I thought we had it i thought we had.
Them all out you're at stinky's how can.
You just lie like that.
She's really good at lying.
You sociopath she should be a defined.
Associate bad jake okay i was like very.
Sincere about my answers like did you.
Feel that way about introverts like i.
Feel like i feel bad yeah yeah i'm 100%.
On the extrovert side what i'm an enfj.
My number one passion is communication.
And like so she gives me like more.
Energy than anything like i could spend.
Every single day with some quick wow.
Okay all right about being like an.
Introvert you typically think someone.
Who's god i need to go back to speak.
School dammit sorry someone who's.
Generally like very quiet but what it.
Really means is that we as introverts.
Just get energy from ourselves like we.
Need to like if we need some space we.
Get that from reading a book or you know.
Watching some netflix as they were.
Saying that's true that's true.
I feel like i'm both though i can get.
Energy from other people as well i it's.
Just like if it's too much i get.
Overwhelmed and i don't like it i wanted.
To represent more extroverted introverts.
And show that like thank you alex i feel.
So much better about myself.
Finally there's no one else like me if.
There's no one else like me then who.
I well done for lying so well i mean.
Respite yeah i just like collect it do i.
Just collect it no leave it there.
Everybody alex because i can seeing.
Having fun parties i love that comment.
Okay just because you're an introvert.
Doesn't mean you're not confident well.
These people maybe integrate a lot of.
Them are are also socially awkward i'm.
An introvert and i still like talking to.
People having fun i just need some time.
