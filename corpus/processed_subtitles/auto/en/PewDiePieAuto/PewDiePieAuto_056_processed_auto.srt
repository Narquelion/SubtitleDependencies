Wait.
What does he think this was there but.
I'm sure he had at least a million.
Subscribers.
Oh so you thought it was weird that i.
Just went in right away.
If i had like a couple million subs the.
Fact that he was responding.
In an interesting that was beyond just.
Friends so.
Quickly is interesting to me yeah cause.
You were wrong.
Mr coach do your math i mean do your.
Research.

Place to go.
Plus it's like five minutes from where i.
Live how old are you.
I guess i wanted to know yeah that.
Sounds pretty nice i'm 21 how about you.
I'm 18. i'm like hell.
Yes i wonder how many times.
Pewdiepie has actually gone on dates.
With.
His subscribers before he met marzia was.
This a first-time thing for him was this.
New to him.
All i know is the conversation between.
Them was so.
Adorable and it was romantic from the.
Get-go i thought maybe they were like.
Chatting about video games as friends.
For a while and then somebody talked.
About visiting each other.
And it was kind of cute and innocent but.
No they got right to the point pretty.
Quickly.
Which i it's cute i like it what are you.
Doing.
Hmm yeah i was more curious what a.
Dating coach think about.
Yeah being pretty straightforward that.
You're into someone right away.
Yeah i don't like to beat around the.
Bush it's a waste of time you like.
Someone.
You you should not acknowledge it at.
Least somehow.
Otherwise you get stuck in the friend.
Zone and trust me that my dudes.
You in there you ain't getting out.
Better make it clear right away hey girl.
I want you work for me then does marxian.
Get recognized.
By now we don't really leave the house.
Don't leave the house no when it's.
Really like in busy days or busy times.
But if we do go out when it's like a.
Weekend for example.
I think maybe a few times a day but not.
As much as a year.
Usually when someone recognizes me or us.
They'll come to me first and then.
They're like.
Let's see you can too in the daily it.
Happens the opposite.
At the blue lagoon yeah the person came.
To me.
Yeah oh yeah she did.
Laughter.
Uh being here you're welcome but also.
For being.
My future wife of course everyone is.
Invited to the wedding.
Check your ring check your inbox.
Everyone that subscribes.
Are invited it's gonna be lit we're not.
Giving out any details right you're just.
Inviting me but you're invited.
Laughter.
I don't know why it's so funny i'm.
Laughing at my own jokes this guy is.
Just like.
Poker face half the time.
All right they're just i mean there's.
Really nothing left to say.
They're an adorable couple they go.
Together.
Incredibly well and i just want to head.
This home.
One last time and i don't want you to.
Get involved but this is so important to.
Me because.
Like i said this has changed so many.
People's lives lana rhodes.
Would never want to go for pewdiepie.
Who lana rhodes.
Is that what some e girl.
I would probably not be found attractive.
In a lot of circles i mean like let's.
Let's put aside the fact.
He's incredibly famous put him with 500.
000 subscribers you know.
Not really well known and he goes into.
Some.
Random sports bar in new jersey put him.
In like a business networking event.
Somewhere in idaho i don't know.
His personality may just seem too weird.
For those people too.
Out there uh interested in video games.
And pokemon and like.
Isn't that for kids or something a lot.
Of people could see him that way and say.
Hey.
I mean you're kind of you're not like.
Ugly but like.
That cool man a lot of.
Women a lot of people could see him like.
That.
Pewdiepie doesn't go in those worlds.
Pewdiepie doesn't value.
Those worlds felix goes to places and he.
Hangs with the people.
That he values i feel like i just.
Listened to the most elaborate way.
Of someone telling me i'm a loser virgin.
But uh i'm.
Uh yeah.
Laughter.
He was literally selling hot dogs for.
Labor when she messaged him oh that's.
Right.
I was oh man who's this felix guy.
Messaging martial we need to tell pierce.
No you could say yeah he had millions of.
Subscribers.
He was really big and that's why marzah.
Was initially attracted to him.
And i would say no what i would really.
Say is.
Felix made videos that he was interested.
In.
And he attracted people that were.
Interested in similar things.
That also god he spent so much time on a.
Point that is just.
Completely wrong you don't have to start.
A youtube channel.
There's so many other avenues to give.
Value to the world and.
Find people that connect with you in.
Similar.
Ways i mean it does make a good point.
Yeah it's easier to find someone uh if.
You enter the circles of the kind of.
People.
That you are comfortable with it's much.
Easier to find someone that you like and.
You don't have to pretend to be someone.
Else.
To sort of get uh girls if that's the.
Goal or guys or whatever you know i'm.
Saying.
You like the peepee of the poopy i ain't.
Judging you.
Bro bro bro b.
I he's actually has a good point i.
Remember that especially when i was um.
Younger it's like i was never really a.
Party guy but i kind of felt like i had.
To be.
To get girls let's get rips that's where.
You meet them so it's like oh i love the.
Party yeah.
I love to do all this    you pretend.
You're someone else.
Um but it's not going to be a long.
Long-lasting relationship doing that.
Youtube is just one avenue for doing so.
And that's the way that felix did and.
That's the way that.
Marzia met felix that's about it for.
Today guys.
Oh my god he made such a long point that.
Is so wrong.
You share those interests with those.
People you are.
Naturally going to fall into.
Relationships with people that you're.
Attracted to.
I don't think me and martin necessarily.
Shared that many interests when we met.
We both love japan.
And that's something that we found that.
We love uh.
Together love our pugs i didn't used to.
Love pugs or something that she.
Introduced to me.
We've been watching a lot of dating.
Shows lately and i keep thinking how.
Stupid it is for people to have these.
Criterias of who they want to meet.
Because it's like if you really like.
Someone you're not going to give a.
About.
These criterias and it doesn't work the.
Other way around.
He has to be taller than me he has to.
Have a bigger nipples than me.
He has to like if you really like.
Someone it doesn't matter.
It really doesn't i think the the.
Since uh dating coach didn't go into.
Much detail i think that.
The biggest uh tip i can give from me.
And marci's relationship is just being.
Honest with each other.
100 and um talk to each other.
And be epic yeah i'm not good at giving.
Advice.
That's it that's reacting to dating.
Coach thanks again for 106 million subs.
Very epic and i see you guys next time.
Pedo children of.
Nine parts it's time to raise what was.
Once forgotten.
What creatures fart spells and poop.
Troops awaits.
Poopty is coming to.
Nintendo's switch.
And remember it has a very big pp.
Pre-order promotion i mean.
Music.
Foreign.
