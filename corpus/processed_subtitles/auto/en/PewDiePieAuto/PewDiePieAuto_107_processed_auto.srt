It's an and it's actually well animated.
But i didn't want to watch it because.
I just heard it was edgy which is like.
The japanese term for a little perverted.
But not.
No no yeah no actual nudity but i think.
Prison.
School really like pushes it as far as.
It can go with it.
Uh but it's actually very    funny.
It makes me laugh.
A lot out loud.
Especially the part where.
Um in the first.
In the first episode where the the.
The girls torture the guys and make them.
Like spit on their face.
And and uh.
Makes the the girl makes him lick his.
Boot and then the guy interrupts him be.
Like you don't have to sing.
Come on don't do this this is too far.
And then they get pissed off for.
Stopping her.
I wanted her what is wrong with you.

Reason why.
Bill gates needs to come in here and.

What's going on.
I was messing hey just restart your.
Computer man.
Every time.

The.
Rocket league doing it i'm lagging my.
Computer.
I think so because as soon as i start it.
Oh man that's nuts what are your uh let.
Me think.
It's probably my obs settings let's go.
Say.
F6 like what are your you have them set.
To like.
Really half or like the.
Uh what do you call them the presets how.
About you think.
Before you open your    mouth how.
About that.
No i just think what i thought i'm sorry.
What is it uh which obs.
Do you use just regular obs or the.
Streamlabs obs.
Obvious studio okay.
Okay look at my options down i got a.
Different one see as soon as i quit it.
Works fine.
Yeah but i've streamed i've streamed.
Rocket league many times on this.
Computer yeah well.
It's because like the newer versions.
Come in quality preset.
Do you know what i'm talking about yeah.
Is do you have it set to like higher.
Than.
Just normal you can also just control.
Delete and you know look at your.
Processor and see if it's like.
A gpu or anything's being overloaded.
Music.
And then you can figure out the problem.
From there i'm sorry for yelling before.
I feel bad now go menacing.
Song but at me i don't give a    okay.
I'm used to it he's always like this.
Channel.
Uh what is in my output settings.
Um should be like under output and.
Streaming and then uh.
I i use a different obs so i can't tell.
Exactly where it is but.
It should be under like a preset like.
Quality or uh.
Fast very fast.
Slow it depends on what the process it's.
Some quality right now.
Some quality did you control delete to.
See if anything was like having trouble.
Look at your uh whatever the    it's.
Called.
You look task manager and uh your.
Processors.
And performance and like crap.
Not responding not responding.
Your task manager's not responding do.
You have a windows update because i had.
One before we started.
Yeah you do have a windows update.
It's using fifty percent of my cpu.
Sixteen percent memory.
What about your gpu.
50 50. did you say you have a windows.
Update.
Yeah well that's actually.
Honestly probably what it is.
I don't know why but windows updates are.
Like dick your whole computer.
Up when you try to stream.
Those god damn.
Let me try one thing okay um.
I think it it could just be what my.
Encoder is.
Yeah as well as the next question let's.
Go ask you use your gpu or your.
Cpu to encode all right i'm gonna stop.
The stream one second don't go anywhere.
Crazy my stream's still on okay what are.
You implying i say crazy    cause i.
You know i don't you know i never say.
Anything.
I was playing the.
I use um the nv enc encoder.

If you turn your stream off you might as.
Well just windows update uh.
It's probably.
So much yes like how many tabs you got.
