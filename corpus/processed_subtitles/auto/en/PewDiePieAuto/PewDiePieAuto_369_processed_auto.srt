Quick question which one of these is a.
Hate symbol is it a the bowl haircut be.
The number 12 or see the okay hand sign.
Music.
The answer is of course all of them.
Let's go through some more examples hey.
Remember this guy i've actually never.
Showed him properly on my channel but.
Most you probably know it's pepe the.
Frog pepper the frog was a booming meme.
From 2015 to 2016 everyone loved this.
Guy from what started in just a pretty.
Small comic book was adopted by the.
Internet to become the biggest meme of.
That time celebrities were posting him.
And what made peppa so popular was that.
He could be made into anything and the.
Fact that there were so many different.
Versions of pepe became a meme in itself.
Pepe practically became too popular and.
Versions of pepe that should never have.
Been made was created which changed.
Things a lot but they were all of them.
Deceived for another.
Music.
Urging racist ideology known as the.
Alt-right jr. for example he put this.
Image on his instagram account it's a.
Meme of pepe and for those of you who.
Don't know pepe is a white nationalist.
Symbol are essentially nihilist who do.
It for the law basically that means for.
The heck of it racist anti-semitic and.
Overall just offensive.
Pepe memes were spread across the.
Internet and the future of pepe looked.
Bleak but there was some who resisted.
Some people fought back a movement.
Called hashtag save pepper was created.
By matt fury hippies creator to try and.
Bring pepe back to something positive.
The internet tried to help even adl try.
To help but it was too late.
Pepe was declared dead by mad fury and.
In one of his comic strips we see pepe.
For the last time this of course hasn't.
Stopped pepe from being used by normal.
People or people with bad intentions but.
Matt did what he had to do to distance.
Himself from what it had become it's a.
Kind of side story how hate triumphs but.
Matt is still trying to save pepe if you.
Want you can check out a kickstarter.
Link in the description either way.
People were ready to move on but from.
The ashes of pepe came something far.
Worse.
The photo from the white house causing.
Controversy today the photo shows.
President trump posing with white house.
Interns at the president's request all.
The young men and women give his.
Thumbs-up signature but look at the.
Intern in the back row he's making a.
Hand gesture that's quite different than.
Any of the others to some it appears to.
Symbolize white power the white power.
Signal is made with the right hand and.
Outstretched fingers that make a w and p.
As in white power hold on we're not.
Seriously falling for this are we ah the.
Origin of the white power okay hand sign.
Was quickly traced back to 4chan the.
Idea was to create another hate symbol.
Like pepe as a way to troll and to.
Create political discourse some people.
Took the bait obviously but it was also.
At this time that the circle game was.
Again becoming popular online the basic.
Gist of the game is haha made you look.
While making the okay sign underneath.
Your waist people mock just how stupid.
The idea was some use it as an.
Opportunity to provoke but it was.
Obvious it was another pepe and this.
Time there was solid proof that it was a.
Troll operation so people did the.
Responsible thing this time and declared.
The okay sign wasn't a hate symbol we.
Can't verify tonight that the claim the.
Okay sign is a hate symbol is false but.
It's never really that easy shortly.
After the unthinkable happened.
Whether path or just attract install.
We've actually started doing the okay.
Hand gesture is not okay.
Blizzard with right to man it's just.
Doing it regular and as i was looking at.
The camera he started to put the.
Universal sign on her shoulder and she's.
Been hot the incident happened while.
Former cub duh glanville was on the air.
For nbc sports chicago the man seated.
Behind him flashed an upside down okay.
Gesture which is said to be a symbol of.
White power the broadcast cut to a.
Graphic with stats but the gesture was.
Seen for several seconds if the cubs.
Actively working to track down that.
Person who made that gesture.
Music.
Hello.
It's me tired of editing this video i.
Keep saying the argument that well the.
Swastika was taken by the nazis so.
Symbols do change meaning like it used.
To mean the sun or whatever it came from.
Buddhism so yeah even if the okay symbol.
Mein used to mean okay these things.
Change the validity of it's changed.
Meaning is pointed towards white.
Supremacist now actually using it but of.
Course they're gonna use it unlike other.
Heat symbols this was given to them stop.
Making it so easy for these people like.
White supremacists have use the sign why.
The hell wouldn't they the problem with.
These hate symbols is that there's.
People who like to demonize other people.
And there's people that like to troll.
And these two just play into each other.
Perfectly they both get exactly what.
They want from each other one gets a.
Reaction the other gets an outrage and.
Then you have normal people in in.
Between who's not even playing this game.
That gets caught up in in it i'm not.
Saying that anyone that gets mad over.
Someone using this sign is part of some.
Outraged mob but there is a clear.
Culture or on getting upset it's it's.
False virtue rewarded with likes we're.
Basically training ourselves to act like.
This and to be clear i don't think.
Spamming the okay sign here look are you.
Mad now like that's not helping either.
Obviously if you look in the instances.
That i showed logically the evidence.
That they are signaling white power it's.
So incredibly weak but he just doesn't.
Matter they did it try sitting like this.
It is actually comfortable wait what was.
Her name again i forgot    apparently.
She's half mexican half polish jewish.
Grandchild of a holocaust survivor but.
She was accused of flashing the white.
Power hand symbol circle game has been.
Used in news media before it's just a.
Way to see haha gotcha wall.
Not everyone is aware that it's been.
Co-opted by a small group of people and.
They and they shouldn't no one should.
Know these things the guy flashing the.
Sign during the blissett footage stepped.
Up even though there was no reason for.
Him to do so and explained yeah that was.
Me i actually had no idea it had any.
Other meaning the most recent incident.
Of this happening was the gru costume.
And warner brothers i got fired because.
They discovered in their home video that.
He made the okay hand sign even though.
The child is doing it this as well.
Why the hell would someone symbol for.
White power in a private home video who.
We see signaling to the parents by.
Acting angry and upset over these things.
You're giving validity to the symbol.
It's supposed to be a dog whistle that's.
How this is defended all we need to we.
Need to know about these things if it's.
A dog whistle it's a goddamn megaphone.
Everyone gets called out on it on the.
One hand it control chola responds that.
They can deny but it also can signal.
Their support for white supremacist.
Ideas so the argument is that you can.
Use it and then just say no i'm just do.
You do in the okay sign so we need to.
Know about this so we can't allow white.
Supremacist to dog whistle to each other.
When congratulations you're doing that.
By making by accusing people that aren't.
White supremacist of being white.
Supremacist you are helping white.
Supremacist i think that's what annoys.
Me so much about this whole thing it's.
Really not about what what's the best.
Outcome and i think when we don't care.
About the outcome that's when we really.
Destroy ourselves here's what i need you.
To do don't get upset about the hand.
Sign and don't spam it like oh i'm so.
Epically trolling you oh god.
Oh no the thumb of one race oh god.
Brofist have bye.
