Welcome to the yearly let's complain.
About you to rewind 2019 edition i have.
Returned from exile thank you youtube.
Gods i exist now after two years of.
Being excluded in youtube rewind and.
Complaining about it every possibly have.
I am finally in youtube rewind this is.
So awesome.
Everyone is gonna love youtube rewind.
Now that i am in it oh no oh god.
Despite youtube's best efforts youtube.
Rewind is still a disaster this is so.
Sad fs in the chat they actually showed.
Me this rewind before i actually got to.
See it and i got to give feedback on it.
And they took some of my feedback but it.
Still bummed listen it's not my job to.
Create this video they just showed me.
The finalized product okay this is not.
How i would do it okay if i can control.
Rewind we'll get into how i would make.
It regardless i do find it kind of funny.
Cuz it's almost like they try to avoid.
All the politics that went on in the.
Previous ones of who they're gonna put.
Up there and who they're gonna celebrate.
And what things are gonna celebrate and.
They just said okay we'll just show the.
Top ones and then that way you can't.
Complain and i just completely backfired.
And when i saw it i'm like oh that makes.
Sense actually.
This way they avoid everyone complaining.
About it cuz it's just the list.
You can't complain by list this is.
Democracy this is what you said you like.
This videos not does it's not our fault.
Yeah i actually have a lot of thoughts.
On this we'll get into it i wasn't.
Planning to make a video on this because.
Just like everyone when you watch it the.
Reaction is this yet there's not much to.
Say about it it's kind of boring it's a.
Wash mode your video that's what.
Everyone's sentiment is when they react.
To youtube rewind but i thought let's go.
Through it anyway and i can get my.
Thoughts on it because that's the yearly.
Tradition of this channel.
I find it funny that people thought this.
Is like a preview of rewind hoover.
Didn't even realize it was the actual.
Rewind that is so awkward to watch that.
Bad word that's the first words i love.
Ita's cringe answer so good okay don't.
Start with casey neistat i'm sorry i.
Like casey nice that don't get me wrong.
But he's been in every rewind ever at.
This point and also him yelling kpop as.
Funny as it is that was not the cringe.
Is part of rewind okay it was will.
Submit going yeah if i got to control.
Rewind i would get get back will submit.
And recreate that beautiful moment where.
He goes yeah that would have been cool i.
Would have liked that marquez did a.
Video with will smith even and made him.
React to that meme i thought it was so.
Gay good times and i brought you down.
With me or this way obviously it's gonna.
Be hard to get people involved with.
Rewind now like no one wants to touch it.
Anymore.
This curse object so i'm already going.
Off tangents that is so awkward to watch.
Youtube rewind 2018 the most disliked.
Video in history on you it's it really.
Damn i didn't realize and 2018 we made.
Something you didn't like so into a.
Nineteen let's see what you didn't like.
Because you're better at this than we.
Are i know they didn't mean for this but.
It does come across as a tiny bit.
Passive aggressive riding wording it.
That way listen maybe if i was hired i.
Could have given better feedback all.
Right.
I hate this click for the shoe it pisses.
Me off every time i don't know why i.
Think it's a cool concept though of.
Showing just the top ones i know.
Everyone hated it because it's like oh i.
Can just look that up but when i watched.
Through it i was actually surprised when.
I saw some of the top videos i'm like oh.
Really damn we'll get to that i guess i.
Have no idea without the jewess the most.
Like crater videos i don't know this.
Thing i don't know what to say about.
This is there's nothing to reacting.
That's why i didn't want to make the.
Initial ad i'm like i don't know hey.
Look at that the mainstream and i think.
This video i think mr. bies deserves to.
Be number one he had an amazing year.
Obviously but you know the title is make.
This video the most liked video on.
Youtube the whole goal of this video.
This is not me being salty but i'm being.
Number one but the whole point of this.
Is to get that metric you know so it.
Kind of fits the whole purpose of you.
Made this the most liked video well it.
Doesn't give a genuine reflection of.
What the year is that's my point right.
It doesn't capture the moments of what.
Happened last year and i feel like.
That's the whole problem with this they.
Try to avoid the politics which makes.
Sense but then you lose the reflection.
Of what the year it was and i think this.
Is a good example of that i don't care.
About music videos i'm just gonna move.
On most like dance videos.
There's video games hey roblox is.
Apparently huge jesus christ what is.
This game get on the free fire had 30.
Billion views what what this is like a.
Fortnight pub g clone and it has 30.
Billion views i've never heard of it.
Almost more than gta jesus christ.
Music.
Minecraft's hundred billion baby goddamn.
Goddamn that's nuts.
You know i always avoid the top games.
Like my i used to avoid minecraft and i.
Don't like fortnight because it's just.
So lame guess mine crafting sort of.
Became cool again but still alright most.
Like beauty videos i guess they have to.
Have this cool i don't care let's move.
On these new creator breakouts it's good.
That they had this because obviously if.
You're just with this topless format.
You're just gonna get money the top.
Graders are gonna get monopoly and.
That's not fair either industry plant.
I'm just kidding.
Oh through gordon made it in that's.
Awesome again there's not much to say.
About it and then they had the most.
Viewed creators as he landed two billion.
What mr. b's dude perfect david dobrik.
Jelly two point five days an animation.
Channel had two point eight billion i.
Never even heard of that's nuts and i.
Honestly was shocked to see myself as.
Number one i didn't know four billion.
Brah four billion my videos aren't even.
Good how will people not realize this.
Yet then they had a celebration of of.
Random things like top female artists.
And friends and furs middle east and.
Creator to hit ten million subscribers.
And carissa god said occasional yadda.
Yadda yadda.
And you know i understand that it.
Doesn't really fit to put it decay in.
There somewhere for those who don't know.
It took it was a youtuber that passed.
Away last year he committed suicide he.
Definitely deserves to be recognized in.
Some way i understand that it doesn't.
Really fit in this format but they.
Should have made space for it in my.
Opinion i didn't even think about it.
When i gave feedback to be honest but.
It's still it's so obvious i find it.
Kind of funny because everyone's like oh.
This is a watchmojo video well jut watch.
Mode you've made their own rewind and.
What they did was they rank the moments.
That happen their personal favorite.
Moments and there you go there you have.
An actual reflection of what happened.
This year case i versus logan and peter.
Pie versus t series and look they made.
Space for ethic as well they've somehow.
Managed to do it so it isn't impossible.
Huh some other notes apparently.
Congratulations got more likes than.
Number eight but they didn't include it.
Okay so there was some politics involved.
I've watched her last years as well and.
Oh my god it was so much worse than i.
Remember jesus christ.
Oh god oh so bad and all the preachy.
Nests.
And all the but i didn't think this year.
Was that bad that was my genuine.
Reaction i don't think it's that bad.
I don't think it's that important i.
Don't think it's that big a deal but.
Clearly these videos have worked.
Themselves up to be something really big.
For the platform it's almost like it's.
Become a way for people to just unleash.
All their frustration with youtube into.
One spot like that's what it feels like.
It's become let's read some comments as.
Well all the reason i watched this is to.
See if they put felix and marcia's vet.
Wedding that's it last year we made.
Something with the most disliked so this.
Year let's try to break that wreck okay.
All right.
I feel like that'd be unnecessary hate.
It's just like kind of cringe as well it.
Doesn't feel like our youtube rewind to.
Me well no one likes youtube rewind why.
Would they try and capture it but i.
Think that's the point people did used.
To like rewinds like the 2015 one was.
Great people really liked it it was very.
Very popular.
And that's crazy - looking back on these.
But the problem is that along the way.
These youtube rewind videos became more.
And more of an advertising reel and made.
It so that we can only show that the top.
Friendliest creators and and look how.
Good we are i look how all the positive.
Things we come and it just becomes creep.
Preachy and it became cringy and it.
Stopped becoming a reflection of what.
The year was and more just over hey look.
How i look advertisers look how epic our.
Website this and it just became more and.
More and more and more you know youtube.
Probably spend millions and millions to.
Create these videos and that's an.
Investment for them to make so that they.
Can get more advertisers on onto the.
Platform but when in reality 2018 wasn't.
A good year for youtube a lotta created.
Who were frustrated and then shoving.
This video into your face was probably.
The worst thing you could possibly do so.
It's like this year they just given up.
On the whole advertising real thing and.
You know people made the joke like what.
I could have added this rewind do they.
Pay an intern 500 bucks or something.
Like that but obviously if they can't.
Make an advertising reel out of it why.
Would they spend the money on it and it.
Makes perfect sense from that.
Perspective they did engage with people.
Making fun of the rewind in the comments.
On twitter which i thought was funny wow.
Youtube rewind 2019 which is an upgraded.
Version of top 10 enemy list how are we.
Supposed to make me in saturday's come.
On peak 2019 mood being mad that youth.
Everyone didn't give enough to be so.
Good so true alright a couple things.
Charlie pointed out i think pretty well.
In his rewind oh yeah well because the.
Ship has already sailed people know that.
Youtube is not out to make itself a.
Better platform for viewers or creators.
They're out to make it better and safer.
For brands it takes one click to figure.
That out when you go to youtube's.
Homepage when you're not signed in all.
You get as a recommended or available to.
Watch right away.
Is jimmy kimmel jimmy fallon slapping.
His    desk and piss in his pants.
And that's what we wanted to came you.
Know but people know that's not the.
Truth jack sims also did a good video.
Where he pointed out like secretly we.
Want the cringe we want to see keanu.
Reeves say you're breathtaking.
Baby yoda and.
We all love to hate youtube rewind at.
This point let's get real here so ethan.
Got an email from youtube about.
Promoting rewind if i am tweeting about.
Youtube rewind and i asked.
I need that pose a call to action.
Question to my fans like what was your.
Favorite part of rewind hashtag youtube.
Rewind and then what people respond to.
Me and use the hashtag they'll get a.
Surprise and a delight someone from.
Youtube will randomly select people that.
Respond to me to give them way for it a.
Fanny pack.
Wait so youtube wanted ethan to post.
What was your favorite part of rewind.
And the top comments will get a fanny.
Pack guys what was your favorite part of.
Youtube rewind 2019 fanny pack question.
Mark so yeah that's pretty much all my.
Thoughts that i had on 2019 rewind i.
Know not very exciting but there's not.
Much to work with i wonder what they.
Should do at this point like what can.
Youtube do to have a successful rewind.
Cuz clearly big done it before.
I think that's literally it they just.
Need to go back to what it used to be a.
Reflection of what the year is don't.
Exclude creators and stop showing the.
Same creators over and over again i.
Wonder if they will actually go back to.
That then or not it will be interesting.
To see next year what they're gonna do.
Clearly this new format didn't work out.
Well but it's still didn't do as bad as.
Last year so hey that's an epic win what.
Do you think would make the perfect.
Rewind i think that's it yeah good just.
Go back to what it used to be but then.
Again how are you gonna get people.
Involved like if i got asked to be in.
Rewind 2020 i'd be like oh i don't know.
About this you gotta you gotta have to.
Prove yourself first kind of yeah.
Alright that's it hope you guys enjoyed.
This video see you bye bye hey hey oh.
Actually guys make this to like the.
Video so next year we can be part of.
Rewind.
For too long you have been farting in.
The corner now you are entering a new.
Era where you shall crafts thy own poop.
The hour of our spells and poop grades.
Is coming.
Marzia edgar and buttons need you.
The timer you will face but crawlers is.
All about.
When you are seated on the porcelain.
Throne where t is the game to play.
I'm not supposed to have my opinion.
About that but the prices.
