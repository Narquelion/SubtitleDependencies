How's it goin browse it is me my voice.
Is completely ruined.
Ah so i thought if there's ever gonna be.
A perfect time for me to do an update.
Blog it is now because it's gonna be.
Chill it's just gonna be a nice little.
Sit-down and i honestly i am way overdue.
To make one of these obviously i don't.
Know if you noticed this but the channel.
Has undergone some changes lately anyone.
Picked up on it but not just that but i.
Personally have undergone some changes.
Lately as well and i haven't really.
Addressed any of it in a video because.
I've been too busy playing minecraft so.
I thought now would be the perfect time.
Minecraft minecraft has completely taken.
Over and i gotta say i absolutely love.
It and it's just been so fun there's.
Just been so much positivity with the.
Channel and all the content and people.
Just wanting more videos and feeling.
Like oh i was such a good episode i.
Really enjoyed that that for me has been.
So fun to follow and to hear from you.
Guys you know when you make youtube.
Videos or at least gaming videos and and.
Frequently at that sometimes you hit.
Certain things that maybe get really.
Popular but maybe you don't enjoy making.
It yourself or maybe some things that.
You really enjoy recording doesn't get.
Very popular for whatever reason or.
Maybe people don't like yet because it.
Doesn't translate as well too into video.
Format so it's almost like you have.
These different you have these things.
That you want to hit as a youtuber but.
And sometimes you hit one or two of them.
But with minecraft it's just been.
Everything this has been all positive.
But the channel is getting more abuse.
Than has ever gone everyone seemed.
Really happy and positive about it.
I absolutely loved recording it and ad.
Revenue is absolutely fantastic like it.
Could not be better i know some people.
Are saying oh he's only playing.
Minecraft you guys see now he's getting.
Ads.
No i would have done it anyway but it is.
Epic i'm not gonna lie i feel like i'm.
Finally earning what people think i'm.
Making out of youtube videos merch is.
Still the best way to support the.
Channel thank you okay.
It is funny looking back as well because.
I did a podcast with cold ones like a.
Month ago or before minecraft took off.
And we were talking about like oh what's.
The next thing gonna be like wonder well.
The next is gonna be yes i think people.
Are getting tired of those type of.
Videos yeah well it's hard to say.
Because no one wants to be the guy that.
Makes the everyone wants to be the.
Follower of that let's just wait.
You should do what everyone else does.
Youtube resolve is changing so quickly.
It's pretty crazy but whenever my.
Channel gets like a second wind like.
This for the hundredth time at this.
Point it feels like i'm always so.
Grateful it just feels amazing and.
Honestly like i can't believe i'm i.
Think i'm this year is my tenth year as.
A youtuber uploading every single day.
And to still be on top of what i do is.
Just unbelievable especially looking.
Back at other youtubers at the time you.
Know the longevity of youtubers was so.
Short.
I always thought like oh i could.
Probably do it for like another year and.
Then people won't care so there's still.
Be able to make videos that i feel.
Really good about and then our audience.
Really like as well it's pretty crazy.
When i started off youtube i made videos.
For like a whole year and no one really.
Watched it i'm sure you've seen some of.
My older videos youtube like to.
Recommend them very specifically like my.
Hundred subs special or whatever and.
Yeah today we're gonna celebrate because.
I got 100 subscribers oh my.
But once i started playing amnesia which.
Was the thing that really took off for.
My channel because i played this horror.
Game and i was giving these little.
Objects in the game names never stefano.
There was barrels which was even i mean.
It's the same cause as i'm doing now.
That i think about it but it was like a.
Very endearing time for my memory and my.
Heart at that time and you know that's.
What i really fell in love with youtube.
Doing that stuff and that's when i.
Decided i'm gonna pursue being a.
Youtuber because this is amazing and.
Then you know it kind of went down a lot.
After a while after a few years people.
Kind of got bored of scary games and so.
Did i so that was a very stressful.
Period when you're trying to transition.
Into something else as a youtuber so to.
Be here again doing the same thing like.
With minecraft having that moment that i.
Had when i started off i never thought i.
Would relive that ever i never thought i.
Would experience that again and i'm so.
Happy that i get to do that with mine.
Crime and i feel like such a douche bag.
Or like peeing on this game would be.
Like no it's too popular i don't want to.
Play it and then here i am like oh it's.
Actually good but also looking back i.
Feel like now was the perfect time for.
Me to play it you know it's not just.
About the game it's also the timing i.
Think at least it feels like i've come.
To a full circle with a channel now.
Coming back to gaming this way and.
Looking back you know it's been a rocky.
Road and i think that's almost why a lot.
Of people appreciate the channel at this.
Point and i appreciate everyone sticking.
Through with me throughout like all the.
Controversies and and all that stuff and.
Obviously looking back now i kind of.
Feel like.
Very stupid about it and how a lot of it.
Just wasn't worth it so basically i'm.
Sorry for all the bad things i've done i.
Just want to play minecraft please i.
Guess i just realized it's like this is.
Why i started making videos it's what i.
Enjoy doing obviously i'm not gonna be.
Able to be minecraft forever there's.
Always gonna be the next thing or.
Whatever but then again if i stop.
Playing minecraft then my pit.
Sven is gonna be alone and i can't let.
That happen.
Another big change in for the channel.
Has been brad who's been editing for for.
Those who don't know i used to have two.
Editors brad and syme so i was still.
Working with me but brad left to do his.
Own thing brad and i have been working.
Together for five years and we made a.
Lot of really amazing videos that i'm.
Really really proud of.
You're wearing a life jacket beats mouse.
264 should i be wearing a life jacket oh.
Absolutely.
Ever man.
Get it and make it.
I see swallowed him so now it's just me.
And and sighs and i was looking for a.
New editor right away but in the.
Meanwhile i was editing my own minecraft.
Episodes and for those of you don't know.
For five for the first five years of me.
Making videos i was editing every single.
Day and as tedious that can be n s.
Tedious and time-consuming that can be.
It's also something i've missed for a.
While and i realized while editing the.
Minecraft videos that i actually really.
Enjoy editing those and i can tell that.
You guys enjoy it as well because.
Instead of just trying to record the.
Video and just get it up because.
Tomorrow we have another video so it.
Doesn't matter you know that's kind of.
The attitude we had to keep with the.
Frequency of the uploads on this channel.
And considering most of the time it's.
Two people involved to get the video.
Down instead when when i get to edit it.
I can sort of shape it in a way that.
Makes more sense than i can really make.
It exactly how i want it and i can put.
That little extra effort in which a lot.
Of times i've seen is unnecessary but.
It's been really fun to do that and.
There's a lot of minecraft episodes now.
That i always sounds crunchy but i.
Generally feel very proud of like the.
The whether episode and you get all that.
Stupid stuff i love that i think it's so.
Fun to make that stuff and i'm very very.
Happy with that it's been a while since.
I've been able to say like oh i feel.
Really proud of this video so that feels.
Really good as well you know they said.
What i said i feel like i'm naturally.
Coming back to where i started with this.
Channel and i enjoy it.
I really did another thing is that i'm.
Getting married soon right yeah i can't.
Wait to be your husband i'm very excited.
But it's also been a lot of work and.
Then to also edit my own videos it's.
Been hard to keep up so there's no i'm.
Trying my best with the time that i have.
Each day for anyone that's a youtuber.
That you know it's a grind and for a lot.
Of other businesses whenever you start.
Something and.
Reach a level of success you can kind of.
Like slow down a bit and let other.
People take over the work but to still.
Have me here to like doing all that it's.
Kind of crazy if you think about it but.
At the same time this is what i enjoy.
Doing this is what i want to do so i'm.
Actually just happy about it i think.
It's fun the final thing i wanted to.
Address now is that you know i'm getting.
Married.
Brides left get hitting a hundred.
Million subscribers did use an insane.
Number it's the dumbest number i ever.
Heard but i still have believe it.
Like before youtube i was that weird kid.
With no friends and then all the sudden.
There's so many people that enjoy what i.
Do it's pretty insane to me i like i.
Still can't wrap my head around it.
Honestly thank you everyone for.
Subscribing whether your been here since.
The beginning or on and off or for a.
Little while i really appreciate.
Everyone immune i there's been a lot of.
Speculation that i'm gonna quit the.
Channel because first of all these.
Pieces kind of falling together i still.
Really enjoy youtube and i'd have no.
Plans of quitting i do think it would be.
Good for me to take a break at some.
Point just to feel what it's like to.
Have a break okay i don't take breaks i.
Just keep going and going and going.
Because i'm so in the routine of making.
Videos but it would be nice to just not.
Have youtube in my brain for the first.
Time in ten years i'll probably do that.
At some point in the future at least but.
I just wanted to address the whole he's.
Gonna quit thing other than that i just.
Want to say i'm really happy um you guys.
Seem happy as well and that just feels.
Really good and i think that's the.
Bottom line is that i just really enjoy.
Making uplifting content and it was good.
To do that so thank you everyone for.
Watching this has been the update vlog.
Hope you enjoyed.
Check out march.
You don't have to like honestly but it.
Would be epic i'll see you guys in.
Tomorrow's video bye bye.
