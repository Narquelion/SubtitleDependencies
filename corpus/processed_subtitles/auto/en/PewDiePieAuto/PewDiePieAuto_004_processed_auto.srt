You do when it's hot.
You drink yeah you drink.
So therefore we have a bunch.
Of beverages that we're gonna try today.
We as in i am because i have the best.
Taste.
Of all time that's right this is a.
Tasting video no one's ever done that.
But i will do it better we have.
Cheap whiskey versus super expensive.
Whiskey.
Water from the tap versus what their.
Expensive was we have cheap beer.
Versus also cheap beer.
I thought it was expensive i didn't look.
At the price we're finally gonna answer.
The question.
Once and for all does diet coke taste.
Better than regular coke.
And also coke zero what is the.
Difference.
Can anyone know no one's ever done this.
We're gonna work our way up should we.
Start with the water.
Okay i look away my assistant of video.
You have to do i look away what do i do.
I can see you pour them actually and.
Then you can mix them up right.
No yeah yeah i am the producer i make a.
Video.
Okay i close my eyes sorry i'm not.
Closing my house.
Because i'm not a suit i'll have you.
Know i have the most.
Finest tongue of all time i will be able.
To tell.
Can i look can i look i'm so excited.
What i can't.
All right all right.
Music.
This one smells fresher do you remember.
Which one is which.
Music.
Okay so one of them is two pounds and.
The other one is.
Free right it's free from the.
Tap water.
Base of smell i would say this one is.
The embossing water you're not gonna.
Tell me okay.
Do i drink at the same time or okay i i.
Start with the cheap water because i.
Know it's this.
This is the chi.
Music.
Okay.
This is the this is bus right.
I told you i have exquisite they.
Actually it does taste better.
It's more smooth you can tell they put.
Chemicals in it but i do like the.
Chemicals.
What can i say can you tell the.
Difference.
Music.
I told you guys it's just me i know how.
To do this and you saw how confident.
That was right too.
Yeah you can't tell a difference.
Big brain big tongue i do have a big.
Tongue.
All right next we do the coke.
I don't know i'm gonna make that mistake.
All right.
Do you think i cheated is that what you.
Think yeah i don't need to cheat.
Oh you forgot one of the coke so we have.
Curiosity cola it's about 1.6 pounds.
And then we have a diet and a regular.
Coke which is i think it's both a pound.
So is it worth paying the extra.
65 so we should start between the coke.
And the curiosity coke i think.
And then we get into the sugar-free ones.
They are close i'm confident i will nail.
Everything.
But to be honest if i don't get the.
Whiskey one right i will be so.
Disappointed all right i can hear the.
Sizzling.
I'm getting hints already i don't know.
Why i'm trying to smell the coke from.
Here.
Hey guys welcome to buzzfeed today we're.
Trying out coke and.
Regular coke yeah all right regular coke.
Or cure all right or fancy smancy coke.
Let's get it.
I mean i'm just gonna straight this is.
The.
Fancy right no this is the fancy.
This is definitely fancy yeah.
It's so much sweeter yeah this one.
Actually smells like coke this one.
Smells like.
Sorry which one is the fancy this is the.
Fantasy.
That one of course what do you think.
Regular coke is fancy.
Smell that that is so coca-cola.
That's what you get if you have that.
Extra money.
Music.
Yeah regular coke for sure.
Fancy smelly coke no doubt my lock.
In decision what are the results.
Music.
Can.
Music.
Laughter.
What do i win prestige respect this is.
The reason i wanted to do this video.
Because me and marcia were having.
Regular coke and diet coke no it was.
Coke zero in diet coke.
And we couldn't tell the difference.
Right i will tell the difference.
I will stake my practice.
It's fine i will die in two weeks but it.
Will be worth it.
Okay i feel like we're doing important.
Science here.
How's the pouring going over there all.
Right you got to get the same.
Measurements.
All right can a swedish man tell the.
Difference get out of here.
Between coke zero diet oh god i got it.
All.
I gotta have zero coke.
Diet boom why do i only have two.
That actually makes sense maybe i should.
Do that no no no no.
No no what we learned so far it's.
Actually worth paying the extra money.
For.
If you care about the flavor you know.
I've seen videos where people like.
Fine water tasters get epically trolled.
And they're like oh you can't tell a.
Difference but you definitely can't tell.
It can i look.
You definitely can what is this oh okay.
Here we go.
Here we go here we go all right i have.
Them here.
I have the three cokes first.
This one is more bubbly don't know if.
You can tell that.
Zoom in on that margin.
Well this is more bubbly yeah okay yeah.
Yeah yeah man this is more bubbly all.
Right.
Hmm this is not the coke.
Even though it's more bubbly diet has.
Like this weird.
Thickness to it.
This is also a diet i don't know which.
One i'll try and find the coke first.
There he is more flavor more sweet this.
Is the cup.
Are we good booyah.
Can pewdiepie tell the difference.
Between coke zero.
And diet coke here we freaking go guys.
5 000 likes on this video and i will buy.
Coca-cola.
Okay tell you what this tastes better it.
Has a little drier aftertaste.
It does i'm usually bad at describing.
Flavors but it's all coming to me.
Today it's got a more richness to it.
I'm inclined to think that this is the.
Diet coke and this is the zero.
Yes.
I mean i knew of course of course never.
Doubt me for a second.
What did i say well this tastes better.
Right it's weird because i.
I always buy coke zero because i'm like.
It's manlier right that's their whole.
Marketing they try and.
Market it for guys but i actually do.
Prefer the flavor of diet coke.
So like don't be fooled by marketing.
Guys.
This is marketing this is you plebs.
Buying into it and here's me ascended.
Ascended from all flavors you just said.
You also get the.
Manly one even though you liked it.
So you were not no no no no.
No what i meant was.
Even though i am aware of it i i still.
Play into it i i play into their little.
Game it's like when a child wants to.
Play with mar you're not listening to me.
Regular coke is better yeah but it's a.
Lot of sugar and it's really unhealthy.
But diet coke is still unhealthy yeah i.
Know.
I know drink water gamers.
Music.
Yeah ask your questions did i say that.
All right so we basically have a friend.
Bought this.
He brought it over as a as a gift so i.
Assumed oh that's an expensive beer that.
They got me.
No it isn't i am on to you mother you.
Give me cheap beer.
You come to my house and give me cheap.
Beers uh and we got call spread.
The caulsberg is uh i think it's danish.
Yeah.
Which is disappointing but i'll drink it.
This doesn't really make sense.
I i can guarantee you i will know these.
The cold sprig is up.
Roughly a pound and the other the other.
One is 1.2 pounds.
So there's no difference.
Negligible negligible difference yeah.
Neglable magical bro how do you say.
Ninja ball.
Neglige negligible.
Negligible.
They're closed i can hear the phone.
That's a sign that it's a beer i guess.
Okay they're quite similar in.
Uh in color actually zoom.
Hurry there wow.

Yeah this the this smells like teenage.
Uh.
Drinking you don't know what beer you're.
Buying so you're just like.

Haven't had beer in so long.

Sorry caulsberg you suck danish.

My way.
Niche all right bye denmark bye denmark.
You have proven once again that you.
Can't do anything right.
Congratulations now for the final.
Test this is the biggest price.
Difference.
By far i can't even find the price of.
This.
But it's 23 years which probably means.
It ranges.
Between 300 to 400 pounds.
I could be wrong it's probably honestly.
Even more because i i.
Can't even find it online a company sent.
Me this.
It's a new brand bushido series by.
Kumu kumesen kumisen.
What the hell is that what is this.
Whiskey.
This is their first whiskey i think i.
Don't think this is even out.
I can't find it online i am so confused.
By this whiskey.
Oh i think i found it i found it oh my.
God.
So the 17 years is.
400 pounds this is probably.
This means this is probably like five to.
Six hundred.
Thank you for sending me jesus i don't.
Drink whiskey anymore.
Um but i still want to see if i still.
Got it you know i'm not gonna.
I ain't gonna swallow you know what i'm.
Saying but damn yeah.
Seven hundred pounds boy did the one you.
Bought me was that word sensei.
Yeah it was wasn't it my second with.
Good wheeze get a wife.
That gets you whiskey it's got really.
Good rating actually 9.2.
Jameson is a really nice she.
This became a whiskey video.
It's a nice out of all the cheap.
Whiskies.
Jameson is not bad it's good it's 20.
Pounds.
20 pounds versus six what was it almost.
Yeah roughly 700. boom.
You think i'm that's fine yeah i think.
You're strong.
Thunder is about to hit at any point all.
The light has left this.
There's no way in hell i will mess this.
Up.
Before i felt a bit scared but no.
There's no way.
23 years will be very dark and it will.
Be.
Very rich in flavor it's not always.
Better to have more aged it's just what.
You prefer but if you are a whiskey.
Drinker you will definitely prefer a.
More rich.
Taste can i look might say zoom in.
This is kind of crazy there's actually.
Very similar oh no.
What if i messed this up after talking.
About no.
No well this is this is the bushy though.
Yeah don't even i don't have to smell.
The jameson.
Because the jameson doesn't smell.
Anything.
Oh god oh.
It smells so good.
Oh.
This is so sad i don't drink anymore.
Damn i am smelly.
It smells sweet and not.
Some alcohols will just hit your nose.
And it's like oh.
But this is just pure it's like smelling.
A really nice candle.
But it's the smell of pure man.
Your face is that did you did you smell.
Just the alcohol.
With the smell my sister made the.
Weirdest face.
I mean to me it doesn't smell like.
Anything really.
Yeah i can't really touch it's weird my.
Nose is a big plug though.
Okay well i passed the first test right.
Yeah.
Okay i guess i wanted to mix them up and.
See if i can just go pure.
Flavor right because obviously it smells.
Better but i will.
I'll clog my nose all right and then.
I'll close my eyes as well.
Start with this.
Jameson oh god.
Maybe i shouldn't judge you soon no it's.
Gotta be jameson that's gotta be amazing.
Music.
Yeah that's the bushido much richer.
Flavor.
The aftertaste hits way more as well.
First when they hit your tongue it's not.
That much difference.
But the flavor develops differently did.
I get it right.
No did i got it wrong no    way i.
Went on this whole    preach.
Are you serious i didn't mean that i.
Just seemed like these and then i that.
Was checked but these had more.
Are you sure yeah this is the jameson.
Are you kidding me 20 pound whiskey.
Are you serious.
What this is so embarrassing look my.
Face is getting all red.
Well i guess i prefer cheap whiskey i.
Actually don't like the makoto that much.
Then.
Sorry makoto i'm lost for words i don't.
Know what to say.
It does smell way nicer but the flavors.
The jameson's flavor develops in your.
Mouth which is really weird.
I wish i had more whiskey to try like.
Actually try.
Uh because i never had my culture before.
Well anything.
Can happen here on the pewdiepie channel.
Clearly i'm a fraud.
But yeah i guess that makes it.
Interesting there you go out of.
Diet coke water and beer.
It's clear that paying that little extra.
Is worth it.
But whiskey 600 600.
Difference guess that's how it is.
I hope you enjoyed me embarrassing.
Myself in front of millions of audience.
But uh that's it i guess this is a good.
Thing for me that i don't drink whiskey.
Anymore so.
Probably for the better anyway thank you.
For watching see you guys tomorrow.
Hey hey hey marta stop drinking it.

Forgotten.
What creatures fart spells and poop.
Troops awaits.
