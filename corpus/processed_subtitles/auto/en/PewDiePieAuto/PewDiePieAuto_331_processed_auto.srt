Music.
How's it going bro.
My name is and today we're looking at.
Sushant.
Singh raiput now i'm not going to.
Pretend like i knew who this guy was.
But i recently found out about him and i.
Talked about him in a video in it and so.
Many.
People freaked out this guy is a big.
Deal i.
Just watched some videos of him and i.
Thought he would seem like a really.
Interesting dude.
Unfortunately he passed away about a.
Month ago.
So i just wanted to make this video to.
Kind of tribute him and.
Bring attention to him in his life if.
That makes sense i don't know.
I just think he's a cool dude i'm not.
Gonna pretend like oh i was the biggest.
Fan.
No i had no idea who he was but i like.
What i've seen.
Now for those who don't know he was a.
Big actor he was in movies like.
Detective biam keshi bakshi you ever.
Seen that one.
He was big in india in bollywood.
Basically.
Uh he got a nomination for best actor.
And.
He's been in commercially successful.
Films like kedarnath.
And yeah.
His acting is cool enough all right but.
I think what.
Is more impressive about him is the fact.
That he's actually really smart.
I found out that he was ranked number.
Seven.
In the engineering exams in of all of.
India.
Not bad i used to study engineering.
Myself so.
I remember i was pride when i got the.
Highest out of 200 people.
Uh i feel like out of all of india it's.
A little bit more of a.
More of an achievement and he also what.
I like about him.
He came from humble beginnings as well.
I'm not gonna try and force.
Like oh with this name it's i'm saying i.
Can relate to him that's all.
Like it's anything the same growing up.
In sweden and india.
Sorry i just realized how this sounds.
Like.
He was also national olympiad winner in.
Physics what smart dude basically.
Uh and you can tell just by listening to.
Him apparently i saw here he worked for.
Uh kapoor remember her that    dumb.
Thing.
I noticed uh sushant followed me on.
Instagram and i was so confused by it.
I wonder if it was because i trolled.
Ekta i don't know.
Regardless he dropped that engineering i.
Dropped that.
Engineering to pursue his dream uh to.
Work in show business.
And uh one of the videos the first one i.
Saw of him was.
When he did this university talk which i.
Thought was super interesting and i.
Wanted to share with you guys today.
Because i think he had a lot of.
Really valuable lessons on life uh so.
Let's watch it.
Excuse me if i don't make sense excuse.
Me if i get a panic attack right now.
But i'll try my best.
Applause.
Yeah i became an actor because i had.
A problem i was an introvert.
You know i'm the youngest in my family.
And i was so pampered in.
My heart that when i used to step out i.
Didn't know how to deal with people so i.
I.
Gradually i became this very shy.
Introvert kid.
Who could not talk well i still cannot.
Talk.
Here i go here i insert myself again i.
Can just relate to it.
I was such an introvert as well i still.
Am but i found this medium through.
Youtube.
To be extroverted and be this character.
It's just been so fun i guess he got the.
Same way through acting.
All right i would love to share my.
Journey with you my learning so in case.
You decide to drop.
Out and join me in bollywood it will.
Come very handy.
So i was thinking in the car what do i.
Talk about wait this guy wrote the.
Script for what he was gonna speak to.
University on the car on the way there.
That's impossible.
But after deep clicking i i i zeroed.
Down into two things that i can actually.
Discuss about.
These two things talk about.
Chasing your dreams and actually living.
Your dreams.
Which unfortunately nobody mentioned.
To me when i was starting out that's.
Funny because i had the.
Absolute opposite advice given to me.
People were like follow your dreams.
Pick what you want and i'm like nah i'm.
Gonna pick the job i hate.
Because money so those two things are.
The biggest lie and the only truth.
About success that i was told about.
I don't remember what it said but i'll.
Tell you what i think.
Is that success has way more importance.
I know it's easy for me to say.
This but i think people put way too much.
Importance.
On success itself if you're having fun.
With what you're doing.
Then you're already successful and you.
Can sustain yourself anything beyond.
That it's just unnecessary.
I think at least money.
Plus recognition is equal to happiness.
Is equal to success was that the lie.
Because i totally agree.
I feel like such a broken record because.
I think i've said this so many times and.
Every time i say it.
Everyone gets so mad and i get it.
Everyone's situation is different.
But it is a general assumption in.
Society that these things will lead to.
Happiness i'll just be.
Extra clear when i say this obviously if.
You can't afford to pay your rent and.
All these things yeah.
It will help you you will get happier if.
You get it but i'm speaking money and.
Excess.
Money and its multitude what people.
Dream about.
People imagine what would it be like if.
I had so much money like millions what.
Would i do that'd be crazy.
You know people love to fantasize about.
These things that's why the lottery.
Exists.
And people like to find science what it.
Would mean to be.
Recognized or some someone of notoriety.
And we generally see hollywood stars.
Shiny and smilingly and all that stuff.
When it happens.
Absolutely nothing to do with that.
Uh your happiness i think so at least.
Obviously people react differently to.
Different things but.
They are literally things that are just.
Like anything else.
After a while they're not going to be as.
Appealing anymore there are.
Sensational pleasures essentially.
They'll flee away.
So let me begin by mentioning that i.
Come from a very.
Uh middle-class family and when i was.
Growing up.
Money was a big big big difference in my.
Life.
Same for me because my parents were so.
Successful they made a lot of money but.
Uh and i always felt like oh god i need.
To live up to their standards i need to.
Get a job.
Just so i can be like them i know like.
Boohoo me right.
I'm just saying there was a lot of.
Pressure to perform well in that regard.
And it wasn't until i decided you know.
What i'm just gonna go on my own path.
Where.
I actually found a lot more of it.
Ironically generations of my family that.
I.
Know of that are documented nobody knew.
What.
Fame uh felt like so basically.
Uh both uh money and recognition.
Were missing when i started out so i.
Already started out as a failure.
Let me be very precise my family told me.
That i had to become an engineer.
Examination and then probably yeah that.
Would be.
Like opening the doors for all kinds of.
Happiness and i'll be forever.
Successful i'll be forever happy this is.
The action.
That i experienced.
All right fair enough sweden or india.
It's the same apparently that's so funny.
But right so i became very good in.
Studies.
Did fairly well in my time board exams.
And then.
Off i went to delhi for my classroom got.
Myself a drawn in a nice.
School and uh with them there and.
Fiji and half a dozen of our.
Other coaching institutes and i used to.
Share my room with three other similar.
Aspirants.
What it meant was every day after.
Finishing my.
Assignment school assignments and.
Preparing for my engineering entrance.
Exam.
I had to wash my clothes and i had to.
Cook.
Food for myself i wasn't complaining.
Well it was worth it because after all i.
Was for the very first time in my life.
I was so close to become.
Successful for the first time in my life.
So yeah.
Finally i slopped i got selected for.
Several engineering colleges.
And i decided to take a mission in delhi.
College of engineering which is crazy.
Now known as gtu thank you.
It's funny i got into my university.
Through entrance exams as well which i.
Worked really hard for.
And it was like i got in it's crazy how.
Similar experience we had and i thought.
As well like damn i made it like now.
It's a smooth sailing from here.
I could finally stop for a while and.
Breathe you know.
I was telling myself that you know what.
Now you're made.
You should be happy because you're.
Supposed to be happy.
But it wasn't working that much.
Something was missing there was a void.
That i could feel.
So i i thought maybe something bigger.
Was required for some reason for some.
Reason.
Incidentally while uh the first 18 19.
Years of my life.
The future of me was much happier.
Much successful than the president made.
So like all right so i was forcing.
Myself.
I promised uh as i promised i started.
Preparing the civil services examination.
And i was forcing myself to slaughter uh.
But i was bored.
Um exams were still far away.
And the main time i thought of doing.
Theater and.
Uh i thought to learn dance because to.
Counter the.
The shyness that i had still have.
And also because there were no girls in.
My engineering college for some reason.
Yeah so somebody told me that they are.
Very good-looking girls in.
Dance schools so i was like fine.
There you have it just pick up dancing.
And you'll meet girl scout.
There you have it once i started.
Performing art.
I knew one thing for sure.
I knew that i quite liked it.
And three years later imagine me sitting.
In the campus.
And i'm thinking all right i'm very.
Interested in performing arts.
And all i want to do is to earn money.
And to be recognized so if i become a.
Movie star.
Hmm i actually was very serious and i.
Dropped out of my couch.
Music.
No way he was that close wow.
Yeah i dropped that way sooner because.
Obviously i found youtube and i was.
Enjoying that so much more that.
Didn't feel like i lost to drop out the.
Idea was to just.
Quit quit school for a year and then.
I'll come back.
Yep got heavily into theatre.
And also the skills that i thought were.
Necessary.
To become an actor and by the way this.
Time i stayed with.
Six other guys in a single room kitchen.
But this time i was prepared for it.
This time there was one difference i was.
Driven.
That folks in engineering and b schools.
Should never become.
So i had to prove a point to everybody i.
Had to prove a point.
To my family most importantly.
I had to prove a point to myself.
And this was the time when i was also a.
Background dancer.
So i was dancing behind all the possible.
Stars that you can think of.
Everybody and i was thinking i was.
Thinking to myself while i was.
Performing okay it's just three steps.
Away there and.
Everything will be solid and i kept.
Going like that.
And two years later guess what.
I got myself my first big break.
I was selected for a prime time show on.
A tv.
Now hear me out was a seriously a big.
Break.
Because i started earning right people.
Started recognizing me.
To be honest i would deliberately go and.
Roam in all these malls.
That's funny i don't think i've ever.
Done that done.
I guess i did i did go on like make.
Videos where i broke his people.
I also suddenly discovered that.
I actually had many friends i'm like.
What absent all this while but suddenly.
They popped up.
Crazy how that works i was making good.
Money.
To a point that money.
Stopped being a differentiator in my.
Life.
Music.
And i was becoming more and more popular.
Now.
I cannot go to all these malls that i.
Was going.
All alone right so i wanted somebody to.
Be with me to save me.
That's the thing you don't realize first.
Time you get recognized is amazing you.
Love it it's so cool and that's.
An experience everyone wants to feel but.
Then you almost feel isolated where you.
Can't go to.
Malls and you can't go to closely packed.
Areas anymore.
You just feel like an alien it's very uh.
Limiting.
The first dream house.
I bought myself my dream car.
And just a note volvo xc90 thank you.
Very much.
To you as well i was getting such.
Female attention that my engineering.
College friends.
Could only possibly fail got em.
Got em man.
So i was having a time of my life.
And then something unusual happened.
I got used to everything.
I felt cheated i stayed with.
All these dreams for 10 and 15 years of.
My life.
I was promised happiness and i was.
Promised success.
But all these things stayed with me.
Just for few days right i'm punctuating.
Me.
Because i started from zero money.
And zero recognition so i was not happy.
How could that it be.
I didn't like this version of success.
And the future me again was luring the.
Present me.
But this time i decided.
Otherwise i would do something else.
So that gets us to the second point.
Which is the only truth.
Yeah i think he said it pretty well it's.
Like he imagined these things happening.
For 10.
15 years of his life and then they.
Disappear in a couple days and i think.
That's it they're nice to have and.
Everyone.
Wants to experience it but they don't.
Last and we put.
Way too much importance to them it's a.
Fantasy it's always greater in our head.
I won't take too much time i'll just try.
To keep it shut.
I figured something i figured that.
Something.
Seemingly big things were not that big.
Once i got them and looking back.
In the past i realized that.
Maybe smaller things were way bigger.
And there was one thing that was missing.
In my life.
That was the cause of this illusion.
And that thing that was missing.
Was now so true.
Yes i'll let him finish his sentence and.
Then i'll say what i want to say.
I was all these years.
Just i was obsessed about what's going.
To happen.
We are taught in schools but if this.
Happens i'll do that.
And uh six months from now i'll be here.
So i wanted to be in control i was so.
Obsessed about my future oh my gosh.
Taking the entire responsibility about.
The past.
But all i was doing was frequently.
Swinging from past to future.
I noticed the words he used control and.
The presence or the.
Or now he was always looking for the.
Next thing and that's the problem with.
With money and fame like.
You will never have enough of it it's.
Something that you can chase forever but.
There will never be enough.
But i also think in general you know one.
Thing i noticed especially here on.
Youtube it's these channels that.
Make uh routine videos where they say oh.
We wake up i wake up at.
Six i sleep four hours and then from six.
To seven i do this and seven to eight i.
Do this and then and then.
On and on and on and on and on and on.
And i i get that those videos are very.
Inspiring.
But being so focused on the things you.
Need to do constantly.
Seems like a nightmare to me i and i.
Think it's the illusion of control which.
Is what he said you want to think that.
You have control over your future.
When in reality it doesn't matter.
Happiness comes from the moment.
And personally as well the more i find.
Myself in the moment.
The better i'm doing it as a person i.
Really really strongly believe that.
Uh we always have this dream that we.
Want to chase oh if i do this then i'll.
Be happy.
Oh if i reach this goal then i'll be.
Happy what about now.
Anyone no matter who you are should be.
Able to be happy in the moment.
That's the goal of life that's what we.
Should try and aim for.
There's no always gracious greener or.
Situation that will make you feel better.
Why not just be happy now your life will.
Never be perfect.
Just recognize that and be happy for.
What you have if you're in the moment.
You immediately.
Realize and become thankful for the.
Things you do have instead of the things.
That you don't have at least that's what.
I notice.
And i think meditating is a really good.
Technique to do that.
But there are other ways as well of.
Course sorry this became a whole big.
Rant but i find that uh.
Especially today with it's so easy to.
Get distracted by things.
You can occupy your mind constantly but.
I think it's important to set away some.
Time to just.
Do nothing focus on nothing and that's.
What puts you in the moment i also.
Figured.
That when i perform on stage or in front.
Of camera.
I am so much excited i am so much.
Interested i am.
Music.
And for the first time trust me in a.
Long time.
I understood the true meaning of success.
Which was not.
Money plus recognition but it was.
Now plus excitement.
I love this guy so much such a great.
Dude.
Now let me share another day's shots uh.
Story with you when i was in school four.
To 5.
30 p.m was the time and i was allowed to.
Go out and play.
I was asked to be an engineer but the.
Entire day i was.
I used to wait for 4pm to happen i would.
Step out and the next one and a half.
Hours.
Felt like five minutes.
I didn't understand uh this then.
But now wait honestly very confidently.
I can tell you this that i am.
Living that 4 to 5.
30 life right now since.
Cause and effects i know are not.
Different.
Excitement is the cause excitement is.
The effect.
I get hired again and again because all.
These success.
Mantras that we talk about you know hard.
Work belief.
Focus vision risk taken talent.
Perseverance we can go on and on but all.
These success mantras.
Are now the side effects of the process.
Itself.
I'm so engaged i'm so it commands my.
Attention so much.
That there is nothing else that you can.
Think about so hard work doesn't.
Feel it feels like hard work and there's.
Nothing else that you can do but to.
A persist talent you will cultivate.
Vision you will get focus there is no.
Other way because it's it's.
It's commanding your attention so much.
So here i am right now five years.
Uh down the line money and fame.
Although still could not earn back their.
Reputation in my life.
But let me show you one thing i have.
Much more of them than i had ever.
Planned.
And the best thing uh my college.
Music.
One of the professors was very dear to.
Me calling me recently.
About asking me to plan this interaction.
With students.
And i very humbly requested that can i.
Get my degree back.
And it's uh it's happening and i'm.
Very excited again thank you so much.
Applause.
So good sorry i know this is very long.
But he's such a cool dude such a smart.
Guy.
Such a good message as well i that i so.
Wholeheartedly believe in.
Just such a tragedy it really makes you.
Sad to think that he passed away.
At such a young age and i think i.
Mentioned before in a video because.
The police say he died from suicide and.
At least personally someone that lives.
In the moment.
I cannot make sense out of committing.
Suicide.
And there's a bit there's been this.
Whole controversy and and uh.
Theories about did he really what.
Happened people don't know and i don't.
Really want to get into that i wanted.
This to just be a video of attributing.
Him because i think he's a cool dude.
And i wanted to share with my audience.
But yeah it's just this statement he had.
About living in the moment i.
Obviously this was a couple years ago.
But it this.
You wouldn't commit suicide if you had.
This mindset it just.
I don't believe that at all i really.
Don't.
Uh but then again yeah it is a couple.
Years ago and i don't want to add things.
To that but.
That's just how i felt while listening.
To it rest in peace or sean i would love.
To meet you.
Seem like a    awesome dude but i'm.
Really glad that you were you.
Thank you for being you and thank you.
For watching this video i know it's a.
Bit different but that's it for now.
Them.
