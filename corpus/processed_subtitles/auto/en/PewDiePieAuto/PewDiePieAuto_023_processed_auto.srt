What's up.
My fellow stupid last week we watched.
Six straight men versus one.
Secretly gay men and oh boy it was a.
Trick.
Are you gay no okay this is that was.
Hard.
It doesn't work this time we're doing.
The opposite six gay men versus one.
Secretly straight man that's even weird.
To say that's funny.
Okay who's straight who's straight i'll.
Find you.
When did everybody know that they were.
Gay literally my birth literally i had.
Oh my god it's black james charles holy.
What the    dude can i say that i.
Think i can say that yeah alright it is.
It is it is fact.
All right i think he's in the clear.
We're feeling like kindergarten i.
Promise oh my god.
Yes i would say he's definitely gay as.
Well.
All right we got four left let's go.
If black james charles isn't gay i'll be.
Very confused.
We brought together seven gay men i'm.
Gay i'm gay.
I'm gay i'm gay i'm gay i'm gay i am gay.
Yeah i believe you i definitely believe.
You all right just.
Watching all of them say honestly now.
Because it changes but just from looking.
I know that's the point is that you.
Can't tell by looking at someone.
What their orientation is except if.
You're looking at blackjack.
Charles i'm gay i'm gay i'm gay.
I think he's not the gay one look he.
Can't even say with a straight face.
Okay i'm gay i'm gay i'm gay.
I'm gay i swear i'm gay i'm so gay.
I just thought about this yeah gay.
People can't be simps.
At least guy gays that's not fair the.
Dude.
If anyone calls someone gay sim you can.
Just be like.
Oh at least i'm not a sim that came out.
Weird you know what i mean that's like.
The new thing for kids isn't it.
Haha you're a gay yeah well i'm not a.
Sim if the liar survives.
He or she wins the entire prize.
Epic here we go i love these they're so.
Fun.
I came out when i was 18 17.
Music.
I know the point is that you can't judge.
By their.
Okay my mom actually asked me when i.
Tried to tell her she basically took the.
Reins and she's like are you gay i'm.
Like.
I was a little bit later so i kind of.
Hit it for a long time i was like 23.
It was like an anxiety round because.
It's so short you can't really say.
Anything.
So i was like let me say something so.
Then i'm not the one that doesn't say.
Anything before the round is over.
I came out to my sisters when i was 17.
And then i came out tomorrow when i was.
21 because she found a cochrane in my.
Room.
She found a what a    running in his.
Room is that a metaphor.
Is that a gay metaphor or something she.
Was like what is this and i was like.
Oh everyone think it's him six percent.
Thought him.
That he's insane he's the gay i mean.
They're not gay.
Bro you cannot wear those shorts and not.
Be gay i don't believe that.
There's no way what kind of man wears.
Shorts and.
Isn't gay straight.
Game my dude i don't make the rules i.
Don't make the rules don't shoot the.
Messenger.
I think he's the knockout he's like let.
Me just see.
Stop me.
I can't get over blackjack shots i.
Yeah i think he's a kerbal they always.
Do this.
Easy all right easy easy curveball i.
Would never fall for that.
Cringe honestly cringe that they felt.
For that he's so.
Obviously plus he's like he's got the.
Gay posture.
Look one two three oh maybe that's the.
Thing one two three four.
Maybe that's the gay posture to have it.
Behind.
It's not me sometimes people tell me i'm.
Not i don't like.
Necessarily look gay or quote unquote.
What people might assume.
Looks gay just like the long hair and.
Maybe the clothes just like very i.
Thought long hair was super gay sorry.
Dave but i honestly what.
Bland.
Oh i'm sorry are we straight people too.
Flavorless for you gay.
Unbelievable no judgment.
Okay i have a question okay okay let's.
Do a hybrid.
Okay let's do a hypothetical real quick.
If we were all on a baseball team.
Would you consider yourself bruh if if.
Black james charles isn't gay i'll.
Believe anything.
Anything can be real i i believe in.
Ghosts now.
A pitcher a catcher i'm a catcher.
Pitcher.
Okay what does yeah we we we know.
Black james charles we know you don't.
Have to say it like that you don't have.
To say it.
I'll do both yeah pitch and catch i want.
To say yeah more of a catcher.
Okay see they can pick what they want to.
Do it's gotta be.
So much more fun being gay it's not when.
Did everybody know that they were gay.
And what age the birth literally my.
Birth literally i had a boyfriend like.
Kindergarten i.
Probably i believe you might do wait who.
Is this.
Oh he kind of flew under the radar then.
He you could be.
You could be there no oh my god yes.
Literally his name is christopher and we.
Kissed on the slide in like kindergarten.
And i was like i'm gay.
Mine was really suppressed during high.
School um.
If no one knows i'm trans so i have two.
Coming out stories so that's very.
Difficult to come out to your parents.
Multiple times well yeah technically.
That's a weird story to lie about.
That's very specific all right i believe.
You come out three times.
One i thought i was a lesbian because i.
Was born a woman so i thought.
Okay that's the thing and then after.
That i was like no.
I'm trans so i had to come out again.
After that and then.
I was like yeah i'm gay too many times i.
Mean he had three times where he came.
Out which i get you can come.
In you can go out you can come and go.
Out but i'm just like i don't know.
That's way too many times.
How do you just make that up he doesn't.
Believe.
It was just so repressed because my dad.
Was super homophobic.
And you know which happened a lot in the.
Black community so.
It was one of those things where yes.
Super heavily protected and guarded.
And then it just kind of came to a point.
In my life where like i realized like.
This is my life i need to.
You know do something for myself and not.
Live in that fear.
So of course i ran away to san francisco.
And and that kind of helped me like.
Accept it more.
Damn you forget about that i think the.
The.
The thing with coming out as gay it's.
Like uh a lot of people and i think my.
Approach a few years ago as well was.
Like oh it shouldn't matter.
Just uh it shouldn't be a big thing who.
Cares and i i still want to believe that.
But at the same time there's clearly so.
Much homophobia.
You see it everywhere online since.
You're not surrounded by it you kind of.
Forget that it.
It does exist so it's important to.
Remember and not just brush away.
I don't know i don't know i was bullied.
In high school for being gay.
Well i suppressed mine so yeah i know i.
Was dodging that bullying i'm not gonna.
Lie.
I was getting bullied it'd be kind of.
Weird to come in here and like make up a.
Bunch of stories about how.
Suppressed you were growing up and then.
Be like actually i'm straight like.
That'd be    weird i mean i wasn't.
Saying like i was gay but they're like.
You sound like a girl you're gay and i.
Would be like.
I'd like rumors go around about me when.
I was like denying it so i was like.
Super pissed.
And now like i don't care has anyone had.
Sex with a girl.
You haven't done i'm allergic i was very.
Drunk.
I'm allergic to this very drunk pulled.
Out i fell in the vagina.
It happens we've all been there my dude.
No problem.
I think this is actually disgusting i.
Went back in the house disgusting.
That's the least anti-simp sentence i've.
Ever heard i.
Accidentally had sex with a woman it was.
Disgusting.
That my dude there's a goddamn chant.
Right there.
Music.
Maybe they did get it right the first.
Time and i thought maybe he was kind of.
Using that to kind of like trick us all.
Into thinking he was like a beyonce fan.
So i was just like let me get him out.
Damn good luck guys it wasn't me.
Okay so what's everybody's favorite part.
About our community.
They're more accepting yeah yeah and.
Super open it's nice to have a community.
Of people that are.
They've been through the same thing.
You've been through who is.
In a relationship not i i don't know.
What that is.
So x when was your last acts.
Mine was about two or three years ago.
And i broke up with him because he was.
Still in the closet and i'm like.
Just out there like i don't have time.
For that.
And um dating someone that doesn't want.
To.
Admit their sexuality publicly yeah.
That's a weird thing.
Was like i helped him come out so like.
When he told me about that i started to.
Cry.
I was in my car i was like i think for.
Sure the straight man has been voted out.
Uh i don't think i think all of these.
Are gay who does everybody listen to.
I'm more of an r b oh it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter who you listen to it.
Doesn't matter your word you're tasting.
Music doesn't define if you're gay or.
Not.
So it doesn't matter i can't believe.
Black james charles even asked this.
It's not even a question yeah yeah like.
Gay artists so what.
All right that's the gate i've ever seen.
You're cl you're.
Clear you're okay my dude okay.
Uh yeah i think he's gay yeah you're gay.
He wasn't giving me enough a part of me.
Was thinking well.
He might just be just a well-dressed.
Person.

Giggers hell my dude.

As xox i thought oh oh i kind of hope.
I kind of hope he is straight because.
That would make it like that's a good.
Shot.
And then there were four and that's the.
Final four.
Come on end it you surely have them out.
I feel that you've eliminated them all.
Yes yes.
Please raise your hand.

All right so you guys want to keep going.

Gay competition who's most gay in here.

Came out.
No no because when i i also fell out of.
Love with him so i was like.
I can't i can't i tried to get my flesh.
And i was with him for a while and i was.
Like why the    i'm doing this like.
I'm sorry i don't like you anymore once.
We started that round and.
I think i went and gave him a question.
Like right away and he answered.

Was like oh crap.

Do this.
He's gay holy sh tens across the board.
Now i've seen that's the game's five.
Seconds of my life.
Because i i mean it took a while to come.
To grips with it but.
You know after coming to grips too bro.
You gotta out game dude that's not doing.
It seeing and.
Kind of showing that we come in.
Different colors and different styles.
And different.
You know everything so there's no one.
Right way to be gay just like there's no.
Right way to be straight you know.
Especially where you're going out.
Representation of just the whole.
Spectrum of everyone's show yeah this is.
A great speech and i'll be.
Well connected we're all together you're.
Not getting there's someone.
You know it's the same situation i was.
In it's nice to be able to see that.
And be able to be like okay so there is.
A way you can still be yourself.
And still not feel secluded.
I am gay literally and.
What straight man do you know could be.
His face like this.
Oh here he comes here comes.
Music.
What are you    kidding me are you.
Kid oh you    camera dude.
What the    what the    what.
What why why why.
Did you not see the split dude guess.
They teamed up huh.
Yeah yeah i was still hoping black james.
Charles was was uh straight.
Look at us yeah good job guys you really.
Have done your stuff.
All right all right all right for real.
This is one of these two.
We didn't really get to hear him speak a.
Lot it could be him as well but i think.
Actually one of these three if i had to.
Guess let's say this guy.
Music.
How can you lie about coming out three.
Times that's insane you're insane.
You came out too many times i was like.
One of those times as you went back damn.
And he knew that.
That's so gay that he knew that yes that.
Means i'm not gay.
Music.
What does that mean coming out too many.
Times is that i don't.
I don't i don't we're talking for too.
Much.
I'm like.
Music.
Well it was risky coming out to the.
Group here.
So he came there and pretended to be.
Trends.
That's weird is that one weird.
Transgender because a lot of.
People invalidate just trans people in.
General in the first place.
A lot of people still care well that's a.
Fair thing i don't know i don't know.
I do get it within the gay community my.
Gaydar and straight are very.
Horrible they're horrible i think it was.
Important to do this to kind of show.
People that.
There's you know spectrum of human.
Beings and.
Even if you identify with one group.
That's not all who you are.
Yeah i agree with that please do they're.
All moles.
But they think they are the only one.
Yes jubilee please listen to your.
Audience.
Gay community we aren't only stereotyped.
