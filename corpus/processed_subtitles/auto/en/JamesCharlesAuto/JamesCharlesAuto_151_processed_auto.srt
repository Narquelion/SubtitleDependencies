So 17 was that weird for me going from.
Like being an everyday i'm assuming high.
Schooler to all the time being yeah.
Tommy our high school was like it was.
Fun and it was cool and everything but.
Then like once i started doing social.
Yeah a lot of people started like just.
Like making like the stereotypical.
Musically kid jokes yeah you do a series.
On youtube called tea talk we're.
Basically every week right you go.
Through i'm so scared of the faces that.
You're making go through the week.
Steaming drama on tick-tock right yeah.
Come on linda oh waiting drama at all.
Costs oh we don't we're not in drama.
This way boy how did you get started.
Doing that and like why like why do you.
Like doing that in the first place.
Um so like i feel like people take drama.
Too seriously.
Definitely and like everyone like takes.
It to heart and i'm just like why don't.
We just joke about it and then like make.
Fun of it yeah and then i think people.
Just like take my things seriously so it.
Doesn't always end up working out but.
Then a lot of the comments will be like.
You guys don't understand sway boys.
Humor that's just like how they are.
They're joking around about it oh oh i.
Think i finished on time guys okay i.
Actually don't look that bad interesting.
Yes thank you for partaking in this.
Makeup really thank you for having me i.
Think i think i had the quickest time in.
The relay i mean at the same time okay i.
Had the best for the my time that i will.
See you in a little bit with the.
Finished i feel famous do you i feel.
Like that they aren't famous because the.
The look is a little off by i have a lot.
That i want to talk to you about there's.
Only gonna be five minutes on the clock.
And then just look as bad as you're just.
Saying you're gonna you got a lot to do.
Ya girlfriend johnson no griffin so you.
Blew up on tik-tok because you were a.
Nurse yeah and medical school yeah i.
Want to know how you blew up in the.
First place and how you decided to leave.
Nursing school because i think that's a.
Crazy decision that's when i first met.
You i'll just say it too.
Okay i said into griffin's do you have a.
Feeling about this case so q is very.
Very smart but then we actually became.
Really good friends first off you can.
Always go back to scores yes i yes so my.
Idea of this was if i can go back and do.
This later i always can like finish it i.
I mean school is always pretty easy for.
Me right like this i feel like this is.
An opportunity and.
Everyone you know gets and i was working.
At it i really love that mindset because.
At school is it super super important.
Like i always encourage my followers.
They go to school pay attention in class.
To your work like it's really really.
Important but at the same time school is.
Always there i'm like i'm a firm.
Believer like taking opportunities.
Taking risks so you got to a point i was.
Like okay i have enough of a following.
And then i met the boys and we're all.
Gonna live together so yeah okay this is.
Worth it when was the first time that.
You actually met all of that wasn't when.
You came to la first no it was on tour.
Last summer he went on tour kind of blew.
Up like we had like a really good summer.
And then i was like okay well i guess i.
Can come back and like finish or do.
Whatever i want later if i do well this.
Next semester doing school yeah.
Everything works out and then i came.
Back to la whenever i came to see you.
Yeah and that's whenever everything they.
Took off it wasn't really yeah pretty.
Much that's when we like this oh my god.
Not change my life yeah see you it.
That's why i always tell you thank you.
Now shake you know you do you do you.
Always talk to you the nicest things and.
I always appreciate it you're just a.
Really good sweet friend i love that.
You've chosen to use the same exact.
Brush for all steps of the routine well.
You see it was just conveniently there.
You know there's lots to choose from.
Right but it all just kind of blends in.
Well girlfriend thank you so much love.
You bye sisters i'm definitely gonna hit.
The eyes all right dude hustler we're.
Gonna have five minutes on the clock.
Let's make a relay race ready set go.
Okay this looks pretty your makeup belt.
Is so pretty oh thank you so jaden the.
First thing that i want to talk to you.
About when you first started on social.
Media there was photos of you and like.
Cowboy hawks you were like a country boy.
Huh yes sadly okay so i was born in.
Texas all right and then when i was 14 i.
Moved to tennessee.
You know i everyone out there if you.
Don't conform to what everyone else.
Wears you're just like weird yeah i.
Didn't want to be weird to be honest i'm.
Sorry.
Right just didn't post scared but now.
Obviously several years later i really.
Want to come i do because i think it's.
Really cool how you're so open about.
Your style your music and everything and.
I definitely enjoy that so speaking of.
Like a major transformation i think.
You're tweeted like how like you buy.
Like only girls pants.
Yeah and how like you buy like a lot of.
Girls clothes yes.
To my viewers probably sounds completely.
Normal because obviously they're.
Watching me i got a lot of hate doing.
The exact things i did now you're gonna.
Mean like especially in tennessee i know.
It's whenever i first started sicked i.
Started painting my nails because i.
Thought it wasn't oh yeah like i was.
Actually a fan of chase which is really.
Funny but i was a fan of chase and i was.
Like yo this is so dope maybe i should.
Try and i did and i liked it yeah and.
Then i got my ears pierced but everyone.
In my school actually almost got.
Suspended what because i had my eye.
Nails painted and everyone was just like.
Hating on me for it is so stupid yeah it.
Was crazy so i got my ears pierced i was.
Like ah i got beers beers inside up i.
Was in the graduation and i was wearing.
My capping down the doors were open all.
The parents were looking and then my.
Principal ran up it was like screaming.
At me he was like you're not gonna.
Graduate if you have your ears pierced.
Eyes literal most ridiculous thing that.
I've ever heard.
Ya know it made me feel really.
Embarrassed where i'm in now i just love.
Who i am now yeah is it i like having.
That story better than just being.
Someone who is like perfect their whole.
Life that's awesome now i can relate to.
People on a different level right so.
That's been pretty cool like people it's.
Good to think about yourself and love.
Yourself but ultimately it up we're.
Gonna go over time again i love any.
Other people it's not worth it yeah and.
That's all that matters and i didn't get.
That so i actually came out to la and i.
Was like you know what everyone should.
Just do whatever they want like wear.
What you want so i wear women's pants.
Cuz it fits my tiny butt better and i do.
Whatever i want because that's what.
Matters i think that's so cool i really.
Do good i didn't make you look better.
Haha maybe if i had more time i could.
Definitely fix it okay thank you so much.
Good work bro thank you i appreciate it.
