Hi sisters team charles here and welcome.
Back to my youtube channel first today's.
Video we're gonna be doing something so.
Crazy that no beauty guru has ever done.
Before and that none of us really like.
To talk about and that is face tuning.
You guys know i'm definitely the.
Self-proclaimed queen of face to it.
Let's be real i am very very very good.
At it and if you guys see me on.
Instagram you would know that a sister.
Loves a good tune i just really really.
Love a photo editing and in my opinion.
As long as you're not editing a makeup.
Actually on a photo editing and.
Retouching is just as much of an art as.
Actual makeup itself i've literally.
Become so known for facesitting at this.
Point that not only do i edit my own.
Photos but so many different instagram.
Celebrities and youtubers that you guys.
All know and love i will not release any.
Names but also some of their photos to.
Edit to so half the time that you guys.
Are seeing are really bomb photo on.
Instagram especially if it involves.
Makeup probably went through me first as.
Well though i also always get a ton of.
Questions from you guys about different.
Editing tips tricks and techniques and a.
Few descried tweeted on twitter asking.
What if i did a video where i edited.
Your guys's southies and it got like a.
40,000 likes or something absolutely.
Crazy so for today's video i tweeted.
Asking you babes to tell me your.
Unedited and makeup selfies something.
That you want fixed and call me crazy.
But i'm gonna facetune your guys's.
Selfies just a quick little just simmer.
Before we get really into this video if.
You're someone who does not believe or.
Enjoy a photo editing um please do me a.
Favor and click the little x button.
Right up here we do not need you here.
And i definitely do not want any.
Annoying comments this video is just for.
Fun i want to make it very clear that.
Like i said beforehand i view photo.
Editing is this as much of an art form.
As actual makeup itself but i will never.
Actually edit makeup on when you're.
Taking selfies there's a lot of.
Different variables that can really.
Affect the final photo such as lighting.
The environment that you're in the angle.
That the photo was taken it and the.
Actual camera you're using so what i'm.
Editing pictures i only like to make.
This selfie that already exists a little.
Bit better using photo editing.
Techniques but i never will actually add.
Makeup and i never change my face to.
Where i'm not recognizable anymore for.
Me personally you guys know i love a.
Good face to moment and i am very very.
Open and honest about the fact that my.
Photos are all very very edited but at.
The same time you guys see me on youtube.
Every single week unedited and raw and.
Also on snapchat and instagram stories.
All day long and a lot of you met me in.
Person too so it's not like i'm really.
Trying to hide anything there is nothing.
Wrong with fixing any insecurities and.
Making your highlight really pop in a.
Photo or making your eyeshadow colors a.
Little bit more vibrant as long as.
You're not crossing any lines and as.
Long as you're open and honest about it.
So without further adieu all that is out.
Of the way let's jump into the video all.
Right guys let's jump right in the first.
Response we have to this tweet is a.
Sister katie bruce lamora another fellow.
Beauty influencer and he said can you.
Fix my flashback oh no unfortunately if.
This were fixable i wouldn't have this.
Candle in the first place okay so.
Seriously now for the first time sister.
Zoe said fix my nose please and thanks.
And she said and this selfie right here.
Wow a sister looks beautiful and snot.
That's good and sasha snows up just a.
Little bit more alright so let's go.
Ahead and open the photo and face tune.
And we're first gonna stock with sister.
Reshape skinnier than mariah so first.
What i want to do is go ahead and take.
This smooth tool and i want to go over.
All of a sister zoe skin to kind of.
Create an even base all throughout.
Especially when it comes to it the nose.
Region usually you guys know i like to.
Just have everything in because if it.
Looks too smooth that looks very very.
Fake and cross it and bust it and.
They're gonna get clocked a real fast.
First sister to date and even though i.
Like to edit my photos the house down.
Boots i like to look them as real as.
Possible next i want to do is grab the.
Tones tool and then grab hicker and i.
Want to pick the lightest tan color.
Right on the center of her cheek and i'm.
Gonna go back to tones and then i'm.
Going to lightly tap on this light tan.
Color all around her cheek area and on.
To the side of zoe's nose bridge so next.
I want to do is go back into tones i've.
Got the picker and then i'm gonna take a.
Dark kind of brown shade and i'm gonna.
Pick it right from zoe's contour over.
Here and i'm gonna use this color - now.
Sketch in a new nose bridge if that.
Makes sense so basically you guys know.
What i like to contour my nose because i.
Definitely have a very very large.
Sister schnoz that i like to just snatch.
That was a lot whoa and the closer you.
Draw the two lines together this smaller.
Your nose it's going to look i'm gonna.
Go back and as always nose with this.
Dark brown color and i'm gonna sketch in.
To nose contour lines and obviously this.
Is gonna look very very intense but.
We're gonna blend them out so now that.
They turn into poor so we do an anteater.
Here i'm gonna grab the eraser tool and.
I'm gonna lightly tap over those two.
Lines to soften everything.
Make it not look absolutely crazy and.
Then it once again a smooth tool to kind.
Of blend everything out so now that we.
Have the contours and the brightness.
Built in we definitely need to add some.
Highlights to really provide a contrast.
And finish off this sister nose snot.
What i want to do is grab the tones tool.
Once again as you can see this is a very.
Very similar theme throughout i don't.
Gonna go to palette right over here and.
What i want to grab for zoe's skin tone.
Is a shade right in between a yellow and.
Orange barely goldy sheen and then or.
Right up at the top i want to drag this.
Color picker to like an off-white type.
Of color then i'm gonna go right in and.
Top right on at the tip of the nose and.
Then kind of right down the bridge.
Focusing it mostly right in between the.
Eyebrows all right guys are we ready for.
The iconic before and after here we go.
Before and after ooh.
Literally so good it looks like she can.
Barely even breathe do you guys know.
That it's always my goal when it comes.
To editing my nose contour and as well.
Nose contour is one of those things that.
Is very much affected by lighting.
Sometimes it can look really really bomb.
And the right lighting and sometimes if.
You're in a very shadowed lighting it.
Can look literally at the worst i just.
Fixed up zoe's nose nice and good it.
Made its sister snatch and i think she.
Will definitely love this and for all of.
You guys out there if you're like me and.
You're on a budget saving for a sister.
House that is how you get a rhinoplasty.
With facetune let's move on to the next.
Sister selfie so we obviously want to.
Work with her nose done hello a little.
Reason girl so good we went to somebody.
Else who wants a different feature fixed.
Oh okay this baby is from a sister emily.
And she says i wear my makeup for an.
Hour when this photo was taken the.
Foundation was a little bit splotchy but.
The vibrancy and the eye shadow isn't as.
Much as i want it also do anything to.
Make it look less wrong let me move.
Every selfie ever and she attached this.
Photo of herself oh my god hello girl.
You look so beautiful your eyeshadow.
Looks amazing it looks like this is.
Actually a recreation of my coachella.
Look so definitely down to help a sister.
Out with this let's pull this into.
Facetune and see what we can do so in.
This photo emily said that her.
Foundation was a little bit splotchy but.
In my opinion i think it looks really.
Really beautiful and bright.
Natural-looking i definitely want to.
Focus in on the eyes for this because.
She said that she wishes the eyeshadow.
Was a little bit brighter and more.
Pigmented so i'm just gonna zoom right.
In and when it comes to working with the.
Eyes the first thing that i always like.
To do is do it the details tool i'll.
Just tap a little triangle right down.
Here and then i'm gonna go in and.
Lightly tap over both of the eyes this.
Really brings up the saturation it makes.
The block of the eyeliners definitely.
Darker.
Makes the eyes pop a little bit and just.
Makes the eyes in general more.
Eye-catching if that makes sense.
Whatever i'm editing an eye shadow.
Especially colorful look on based it i.
Would like to do it in the same exact.
Order that i would apply and so for this.
I'm assuming because i did this as well.
That she started off with the colors in.
The crease and so what i want to do is.
Grab the tones to it right down here and.
I'm gonna start off with the right eye.
Or i guess her left eye hello and i'm.
Gonna grab a yellow tone first and i'm.
Gonna grab it right over here and i'm.
Just gonna start off by lightly tapping.
Right in it dot regen then i'm gonna go.
Right in with orange topping right next.
Door.
Same thing with the red right next door.
As well and then already it's looking so.
Much brighter but let's be real definite.
Looks a little bit fake right now so i'm.
Assuming she was going for a half cut.
Crease so what i'm gonna do is grab the.
Eraser tool and zoom way in and i'm.
Gonna lightly scrub over that crease.
Region to make sure that it still looks.
Nice and cut and then i'm gonna zoom out.
And lightly tap over that entire eye to.
Keep the shadow that we've blended in it.
But only make it like 50% there that.
Makes sense so it's just a little bit of.
A boost but not to the point where it's.
Like fake and looks like a literal.
Rainbow on the eye so before i go into.
The eraser tool just like i did in the.
Other eye if there's one a really.
Important thing that i want to note that.
I can't i self personally doing all the.
Time and is a major major major major.
Face to know that it's gonna give away.
The fact that it's edited real quick so.
Whatever you're taking a selfie at like.
Sister emily or like me have you turned.
Your head to the side and you take a.
Selfie of course we get that good.
Jawline we got that good highlight but.
Whatever eye is facing away from the.
Camera is never going to be as bright as.
The other eye because there is it light.
Heading in so you can help it out a.
Little bit but definitely be careful and.
Use it at your own risk so as you can.
See before and after before and after.
Definitely hoping out the pigmentation a.
Little bit without going insane like.
We've done the other eye.
I think i'm popular that so next in this.
Makeup tutorial if i'm remembering.
Correctly i cut the crease using.
Concealer and then glitter and i was.
Doing emily did the same exact thing so.
I want to make that glitter on her lid a.
Little bit brighter if you zoom in as.
You can see it right here on the lid you.
Can see that she has some specks of.
Light which tells me she did put a.
Glitter there but i'm losing the.
Lighting she was and.
Didn't exactly pick it up so let's bring.
It back a little bit i'm first gonna.
Grab the tones tool once again.
When to palette and a light yellowy kind.
Of born shade and go all the way over to.
The left and an off-white and then i'm.
Gonna sketch that right in between the.
Lashes a really important technique.
Winter face tuning is always the top.
Things and as opposed to scrubbing it on.
Especially when it comes to eye shadow.
Stuff because if you're wearing lashes.
The last thing that you want to do is.
Cover up those losses with whatever fake.
Glow you're putting on because it's.
Gonna look really really fake and really.
Really bad i think i'm definitely happy.
With that animate the lid much nicer.
Brighter definitely the glitter looks.
Like it's actually there now and while.
We're still on that kind of a light.
Yellow white shade does like i did on.
Sister zoe with the nose snatching i.
Want to add a little bit of that shade.
Or right here into the inner corner to.
Make her inner corner highlight a little.
Bit brighter and then same thing right.
Up here on the brow bone to really.
Intensify that highly and add a little.
Bit more contrast and attention to the.
Eye once again eraser tool just lightly.
Tapping over that and that looks so.
Snatched similar to rely shadow at the.
Last some of editing is what's going to.
Be at the blacks or the dark shades and.
You always do this to make sure that.
Nothing gets really really money kind of.
Gob tones one last time and grab a black.
And zoom all the way in and i'm just.
Gonna start lightly packing this right.
Into the crease to kind of add a little.
Bit more dimension onto the outer corner.
And then as well right underneath that.
Eye region because as you can see.
There's a little bit of lightness and.
Her crease that she probably did not.
Want there and then tapping in included.
That looks a little bit crazy and.
Ridiculous so once again dropping the.
Eraser tool and just lightly tapping.
Over everything to keep a little bit of.
That dimension but just erasing it so it.
Still looks a little bit natural and.
Last i finally not at least when it.
Comes to editing the eyes at this step.
Is totally optional i personally love to.
Do this in all my photos it's really.
What gives me that doll like look that a.
Lot of you guys love it's going to be to.
Brighten the actual eye so in this photo.
Emily has beautiful bright blue eyes but.
Clearly she's wearing a pretty big.
Lashes and black eyeliner so they did.
Get a little bit lost inside what i want.
To do is grab the tones to all once.
Again and i'm going to dip into a kind.
Of like an aqua shade then zoom into the.
Pupils and i'm just gonna kind of place.
That color right in the bottom and a.
Little bit of a rounded u-shape there it.
Is girl so good hello she thought it.
Staring it's my soul loved ah and then.
Of course erasers will top over it so.
It's not too intense and too scary.
Alright i think we're ready for before.
And after numero dos let's go and take a.
Look at what we were able to do -.
Emily's rainbow eyeshadow look we have.
The before and the.
Literally so cute as you can see we do.
Not actually edit any makeup on just.
Edited what was already there to make it.
A little bit more intense more vibrant.
More eye-catching and i think this looks.
So beautiful and so stunning and this is.
Actually like the same exact i think.
That i used to edit my coachella rainbow.
Makeup look photo so if any of you guys.
Recreate the look try this out and try.
Any of these techniques with your.
Eyeshadow looks i guarantee it'll make.
Your makeup look so much more beautiful.
And so much more pop in it for your.
Sister selfies alright guys so let's see.
Who our next victim is that we already.
Did nose contour and also the our region.
So i think i next want to focus on skin.
You're kidding hello britney j said give.
Me a snatch dose and a blinding highly.
Also this was a recreation of one of.
Your looks you guys are all so pretty.
And talented what the huh oh here's this.
Ginty okay leah said can you fix my skin.
Please sister make it look snap so let's.
See hello.
It literally already is - okay i'm not.
Gonna help her but this does bring up a.
Really good point that i actually want.
To mention when it comes to editing skin.
And once again it this is saying that i.
Catch myself doing a lot what are the.
Biggest no-nose of face to ever is over.
Editing the skin there's this smooth.
Tool and there's a super smooth tool.
Moving can only go so far obviously it.
Always like to start out with the smooth.
Tool just lightly tap over everything to.
Kind of even out the base i personally.
Love the look of a little bit of skin.
Texture even if there's a few.
Imperfections in there because i think.
It makes the photos look a lot more raw.
And a lot more real and if you're.
Editing a lot more believable okay let's.
See who we can actually help out here.
Hello okay this is a selfie from a.
Sister anarky and i love her i follow.
Her on twitter hey girl.
What's up and she sent me this beautiful.
Host makeup selfie with this beautiful.
Pink weight on it hey girl.
Love that and she actually gave us a no.
Comment so i wouldn't think this healthy.
Version focus on the skin because.
There's a few things that i want to.
Change to make this photo just a little.
Bit better alright so we have this photo.
Up and ready to go and the first step is.
Always going to be the smooth tool she.
Literally has almost perfect skin but.
She does have a few blemishes right here.
On the cheek that we can definitely get.
Rid of super easily so i'm gonna grab it.
The patch tool like duct go right over.
The pimple area and then bring it to an.
Area right next door in the contour just.
To get rid of it and click the checkmark.
And bam gone wow so easy is so beautiful.
Gonna go right over this same exact.
Thing click the little check mark wow.
Blemishes never heard of them.
For me personally when i'm editing.
Photos if i have a really bad pimple.
That's always the absolute first thing.
To go i'm very very insecure about my.
Acne and i know.
A lot of you guys out there are as well.
But if you're able to rock your acne and.
Feel beautiful and confident with it go.
You major props.
Unfortunately for myself cannot say the.
Same but if any you guys wonder how to.
Edit it out patch tool that's how so now.
We go back into our normal regular.
Routine of styling the sister smooth.
Tool just to kind of blend everything.
Together and just give you a nice and.
Even base as you can see here if i click.
The before and after it still keeps a.
Lot of that skin texture and a lot of.
The dimensions of her face but it does.
Blend out some of those harsher areas.
And contours making everything look.
Really really beautiful and more smooth.
So much of the eye shadow i now when i.
Grab the details tool and i want to just.
Detail over any features such as the.
Eyes the eyebrows and the lips because.
Of course we did a smooth out the skin.
And i don't want to lose any of that.
Dimension and i was time for the tones.
Tool and this is literally like my.
All-time secret to getting a perfect.
Skin and freeze to it can't believe i'm.
About to give you guys this full-on.
Secret but turn welcome i love doing.
Charity work i'm gonna grab the tones.
Tool and i just want to even out.
Anarchies skin tone and then a recontour.
It so it looks literally so incredibly.
Statue all about to be so shot gonna.
Grab the picker tool and i'm gonna grab.
This kind of light ish yellow shade or.
Right here underneath her eye and i'm.
Gonna use that and tones and i'm gonna.
Kind of brush that over this entire.
Region do not change the color i'm gonna.
Grab that same exact shade of yellow and.
I'm gonna pop that right in the center.
Of her forehead right over her upper lip.
Region as well if you're like me and.
You're a man you probably have a 5.
O'clock shadow and if you're like.
Anarchy and you have beautiful big lips.
Usually your lip tends to flip up which.
Gives a natural shadow in this region so.
Sometimes it's really good to put a.
Highlighter there to kind of counteract.
That so it doesn't look like a really.
Weird and gross by the clock shadow that.
Most of us probably do not want i'm also.
Gonna pop a little bit of this yellow.
Right here right kind of on the jaw line.
Region or right in between like this.
Contour area and then similar to every.
Other process so far i'm gonna grab the.
Eraser tool and i'm gonna lightly tap.
Over that entire region to keep the code.
That i just added but make it a little.
Bit less intense so it's not like the.
Most and like literally bright yellow.
Okay so we just highlighted and our key.
Space by adding a lot of yellow all.
Around but she is a woman of color and.
The last thing that i want to do is.
Lighten her skin tone or give her a.
Flash marry moment that is so not the.
Mood for today a so now i want to kinda.
Rock those highlights by a contouring a.
Little bit better grab the tones tool.
Once again and i'm gonna grab a shade.
Kind of on the outer perimeter of her.
Face right up in here by her hair.
And i want to use that brown shade with.
The tones tool to kind of add in and.
Intensify a little bit of those contours.
To really bring a lot more dimension.
Back so i'm gonna place that right in.
The hollows of her cheekbones kind of.
Right along her nose bridge similar to.
Sister zoe from before hand and also.
Right up in that hairline region to make.
The forehead look nice and snatched when.
You're editing - before you go ahead and.
Save or erase anything it's really.
Important to check the little blue.
Button down here and select your before.
And afters to see where your color.
Actually is as you can see right here i.
Accidentally put a little bit of brown.
It and our he's hair and i definitely.
Did not want that there so i'm gonna be.
Eraser tool and just go right over at.
That region because if that looks a.
Crusted busted and i actually have some.
Brown up here as well this contour looks.
Absolutely beautiful once again like i.
Said i'm gonna take the eraser tool.
Though and kind of soften it a little.
Bit because let's be real it's looking a.
Little bit harsh and i don't want her to.
Look crusted just a little bit more.
Chiseled alright guys i think we are.
Ready for our before and after sister.
Anarky ready here we go we have the.
Before and bam the after oh my god.
Literally so it's not as you can see it.
By using the tones - and the details -.
And the smooth tool you're able to.
Really even out that skin tone and make.
It look so much more smooth while still.
Keeping all of the different highlights.
And contours and looking beautiful and.
Defined these are the techniques that i.
Use in all of my photos to get beautiful.
Skin so hopefully you guys were able to.
Follow that and it was a little bit.
Complicated but i think anarchy is going.
To absolutely love this alright sisters.
So those are three photos of you guys.
All completely edited if we started off.
With this is your nose contour eye.
Shadow and then also skin off through.
And i feel like that had all of the.
Different points that really go into my.
Face tuning rutina but this video would.
Only be fair if now i have to face soon.
Myself until you guys what am i before.
Actors i done this a few times before.
But let's be real i definitely face tune.
A lot so i thought it'd be fun to kind.
Of look through some of the photos that.
I've been taking recently and show you.
Guys what it takes to go from regular.
Photo to instagram ready let's go.
Through a camera roll and find a good.
And fresh.
Sister instagram a selfie so that's you.
Can see of 8201 photos i definitely need.
To go through and clean those up soon a.
Lot of them are a selfie he's okay i.
Have these always from a shake shack a.
Few days ago i took them while i was.
Eating fries i've been in fresh photo.
Shoot let's see other words you have to.
Pick up the one that i want first and.
There's.
A lot of them oh my god the lighting and.
Shake shack is literally the worst hello.
Wait that's not hey shake sucker i love.
You please sponsor me okay i just go.
Through all these and the bad lighting.
And the bad outfit choice not exactly my.
Favorite not even gonna lie but i think.
That i finally decided on this photo to.
Possibly be grabbed don't even know.
Might be doing this editing all for.
Nothing but i'm gonna pull this one.
Right in to face soon and i'm gonna show.
You guys the full-on process i'll be sp.
Through this because it's actually gonna.
Be a lengthy process but you guys get to.
Watch enjoy.
Music.
Music.
Music.
You.
Music.
Music.
Literally 20 minutes later that was ugly.
A long visioning process but this photo.
Had a lot of saving to do let's be real.
And i probably will even go back into.
This later on and i think i'm ready to.
Show you guys this iconic sister james.
Charles instagram ready before and after.
Ready we have of course the before that.
You guys all saw and one two three bam.
The after hello there was definitely a.
Lot that i wanted to do if we look at.
The before and afters as if idli on the.
Base yeah sister needed a little bit of.
Work there was this really weird and.
Very very dark line going down the.
Entire side of my face i have no idea.
What that was i'm assuming it was a.
Shadow from either like a windowpane or.
Something lord knows that's not usually.
There at least i hope not i did do a.
Little bit of reshaping and you guys.
Know i'm very very insecure about the.
Size of my forehead so brought her down.
Just a little bit and then for the most.
Part i just evened out my skin tone.
Using the same techniques that we used.
On sister anarchy slim down the nose.
Bridge is a little bit using the same.
Technique she used on sister zoe and.
Then detailed the eyes like we did on.
Sister emily that was super simple then.
I finished it off using a not so simple.
Filter it does add a really really cool.
Effect and i think that that is it the.
Finished photo and i really like how.
This turned out i was a little bit.
Spooked at first not gonna lie but i.
Think this might be instagram ready.
Maybe.
Alright sisters that is only half for.
This videos today and not even gonna lie.
I just had so much fun for the past few.
Hours editing all these pictures base.
Hitting is of my all-time favorite.
Pastime so hopefully you guys all watch.
Us to learn some helpful and do it tips.
And tricks that you can use next time.
You're editing your instagram pictures i.
Want to say a major thank you - zoe.
Emily and anarchy for all sending in.

Beautiful too like literally the best.
Ever have everybody shaking and having.
Wigs snatched left and right also side.

To fix any insecurities that you may.
Have or just to make your photos look.
Really.
Bob but it is so important that you guys.
Love yourselves love your bodies and.
Love the person that you are and of.
Course if you want to change that that.
It's a very very personal decision but.
