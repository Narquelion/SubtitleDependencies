It's time to do my own intent looking a.
Little bit hey i'm actually gonna tell.
You guys this maze ado is in partnership.
With a bomb knights and they are in.
Australia tenant gran they actually.
Learned about them i think it was like.
Two or three years now the first thing.
That i was there when australia for a.
Really good friend of bercow and i.
Linked our products a lot because.
Obviously they're self tearing which is.
Important but i like be a color on your.
Tones that the public see this house.
Because it's more like all until where.
Is a lot of other tanning products or.
Orange which is not the move so yeah i'm.
Just going to squirt a nice amount onto.
My little tanning glove and the design.
Used to be color light  medium by the.
Way they do have a dark as well first.
Going to rub it on my leg and i just.
Going to do even strokes all over you.
Know even show up sir even folks okay so.
I really am self tanning in general.
Especially if you guys are going for.
What i do know that i used to get spray.
Tans all the time okay i'm not going to.
Pretend like that wasn't like okay but i.
Like self-tanning a lot better one.
Because it's a lot less expensive okay.
Although they look great we're very very.
Pricey and i got to get them touched on.
All time whereas this usually this rub.
On and then just wait a few hours but.
Obviously we're putting this during the.
Day as well but usually let's do this.
Before bed and then i'll sleep in it.
Alex really makes them bronzed alright.
So how do pretty much look like over my.
Entire body now and i'm just going to.
Use the access attending the stuff on.
The mat and just do what my face so i'm.
Not gonna do like a full score on here.
Just because i don't want to be crazy.
Alright ebay so the second i'm going to.
Cut in winter tana.
A nice butt cheeks put some clothes back.
On and we're going to let this chance at.
My body for about six hours.
Oops six hours in order to get the best.
Result so i can have that beautiful.
Australian aglow if you want to take a.
Warm shower and wipe everything off and.
It'll be beautiful.
So in the meantime i have all the other.
Quarantine and big over steps to get.
Started.
Any on the ball nice and that's how it.
Works by nice and calm and you guys can.
Use no james first 20% off enjoy your.
Tan okay so before we head on to the.
Harder parts of the transformation that.
Like doing my own nails and cutting my.
Own hair i want to show you guys one.
Super easy and really really cute way to.
Get fake freckles using actual henna in.
Case you guys don't know what henna is.
And is basically a natural type of a.
Temporary tattoo used in indian culture.
To do it literally the most stunning a.
Beautiful body art ever and you guys.
Know that i love fake freckles and live.
And put them on all the time and i was.
Looking into how to like actually.
Achieve them a few months ago and a lot.
Of people were using actual natural.
Henna to do them so i ordered a bunch on.
Etsy if you guys decide to do this by.
The way make sure that you don't just.
Get like a stupid store-bought henna get.
It on either amazon or etsy and make.
Sure you're searching for natural stop.
Or else it's gonna look so bad and i try.
The same as before so don't worry but.
I'm just gonna use my henna cold it and.
Give myself some phone calls so.
Basically all i'm gonna do is just start.
Putting little dots all over my face and.
I know this is gonna look absolutely.
Crazy okay we're gonna leave this on it.
For pretty much as long as the spray tan.
So we'll take it off at the same time.
But when we take this off it's gonna.
Leave a really really natural-looking.
Super super light orgy reddish-brown.
Stain on your skin for a few days that.
Looks exactly like real freckles.
Like i said they look crazy yeah yeah.
Trust me okay it's gonna look so so good.
And a lot less particular nation around.
This all right you guys so the next step.
Of our quarantine.
Glow up is going to be doing my own.
Nails now this i am so scared for okay.
I've never done that my own nails before.
Work with a lot of really amazing nail.
Tags here no i i got the set up few.
Weeks ago as you can see they are very.
Very grown out so i guess i'm gonna try.
To get myself a build today so i've.
Gotten my nails done enough times out to.
Kind of know the basic like techniques.
Of what needs to happen and i know that.
I need to start off by getting rid of.
The topcoat and gel polish that was on.
There already.
Oh you know they just realized what i.
Said wait my feet are in the water.
Oh no fundacion sweetie i'm so sorry.
That's my own fault that is not the.
Brand salt okay please don't kiss my.
Sponsorship okay put a nice bead on.
There.
Look how papa sloths it looks milky.
That's one that's a notch attend for.
Sure okay i guess that is one nail all.
Completes and i have nine other ones.
That frankly i don't want to do and.
Probably i'm not gonna do if we're being.
Honest so yeah this is gonna be bad and.
Let's just move on with the maple all.

Spots ready nothing nothing is going on.
Maybe maybe be hot.
Stained through the fan and once i.

And the freckles will actually be there.
