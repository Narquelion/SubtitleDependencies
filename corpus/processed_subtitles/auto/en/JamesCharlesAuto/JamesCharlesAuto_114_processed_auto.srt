Hi sisters james charles here welcome.
Back ig channel oh my god it feels.
Literally so good to be sitting here and.
Filming it in front of this camera right.
Now i know you guys have obviously been.
Seeing videos for me all the time but.
They were actually all pre filmed.
Because i've been to traveling and just.
Working on a lot of super awesome and.
Secret things the past few days which.
Has been so so so exciting you guys are.
Literally not ready for the things that.
Are about to come with the sisterhood.
But regardless in case you cannot hear i.
Am very sister sick right now i just.
Traveled to a vegas in salt lake city.
This past weekend of a good friend at.
Lips like nick for her makeup tour but i.
Got very very sick which is so.
Inconvenient and so rude and so.
Homophobic but i've been downing mucinex.
And don't stop and awesome and blowing.
My nose every 15 seconds thank you.
Kleenex hashtag not sponsored but.
Hopefully we'll be gone soon.
And if you already hated my voice get.
Ready for this video because this is.
About to be intense since i literally.
Have not had makeup on in over a week.
Now and knowing that blowing my nose.
Would take off my nose contour in about.
Three seconds flat i really just want to.
Sit down today i play with a little bit.
Of makeup i have a really pretty look in.
Mind inspired by a bum of a mitchell i.
Saw the times instagram page and i was.
Like wow any this on my face right now.
So we're just gonna chill i want to do a.
Little bit of a sister q&a as well.
Because i haven't done one in a while.
And for videos that i'm doing these more.
Colorful creative looks doing a juicy.
Q&a during that was literally the only.
Way that i can guarantee it'll still get.
Views and you guys will still watch so.
Love being a bargaining queen let's jump.
Into the video all right guys just.
Something right and this question is.
Actually a really good one to start off.
With that i'm really gonna think about.
Here but this is from a sister owed ron.
And he said if you couldn't be convicted.
Of any one type of crime what criminal.
Charge would you want to be immune to.
That is such a good question if i could.
Be immune to any criminal.
Oh my god 100% hello rob the u.s.
National bank right now take all the.
Money and run and nobody ever knows are.
You kidding i finally be able to buy my.
Sister house without having to worry.
About three lines of credit 100% that's.
Actually such a crazy cool person though.
I've never even thought about i want you.
Guys to all answer that in the comments.
Down below to actually maybe not i could.
Get bad real fast.
Never mind dog dude.
I think you're a great hair you're.
Kidding what is this i do what this is a.
Joke i have a great hair at age 18 oh my.
God wait kelly give me a zoomin that's a.
Gray hair i quit.
Oh my god i'm scared you call hayes what.
The hell that just ruin my day and my.
Life probably oh my god.
Sister nika ass what's one thing wrongly.
Did in your makeup routine before you're.
A professional makeup artist that you.
Would say to your younger self right now.
When you have all this knowledge oh my.
God 100 percent will be stop using so.
Much powder while baking your face.
Clearly you guys know flash like mary.
Happened for a reason and it's because i.
Used to use literally so much baking.
Powder it's absolutely insane like i.
Used to pack it on with a powder puff.
Not even a beauty blender and it looked.
So bad and not only did i look very very.
Textured but it also created one of my.
Biggest scandals of all time which thank.
God i was able to turn it into a meme.
And make it productive for me but oh my.
God it was really really embarrassing in.
The moment i feel like a lot of people.
Who watch beauty gurus for makeup.
Education including myself this is.
Totally how i learned how to do makeup.
In the first place.
Tend to follow exactly what a lot of us.
Do and implement those steps into like.
Their everyday makeup routines literally.
Once again that's how you learn to do.
Makeup in the first place obviously you.
Should support and watch whatever you.
Want and whoever you find entertaining.
Duh but when it comes to actually.
Listening to the tips and advice and.
Implement take different products and.
Techniques into your routine i would say.
That it's really really important to.
Find a guru or one or two who have very.
Very similar features and skin types to.
Because people like patrick starr for.
Example who use a million pounds of.
Pressed powder may sit there and say yes.
Baked your face bake your face bake your.
Face but for those people who want a.
Really really dry skin if you do that.
You will look like the sahara frickin.
Desert and then on the flip side there's.
A lot of gurus out there such as icarly.
By bell or jocelyn hill who have more.
Normal to dry skin and they don't really.
Set their face much at all except for.
Underneath their eyes and for people who.
Have oily skin if you did that your face.
Would be melting off at about thirty.
Seconds flat after walking outside with.
No pressed powder on so it's really a.
Matter of finding different people that.
You not only like and find entertaining.
To watch but also are able to give you.
Accurate techniques that are going to.
Work for you i definitely say for me i.
Wish i took my skin type into.
Consideration more when learning how to.
Kind of set my face in place we would.
Have avoided klaustreich mariya but.
At least we got a really iconic meme out.
Of it mariah asks how did you grow so.
Fast in the beauty industry.
What's your secret  method you use to.
Get noticed  stay notice this is.
Actually a really good question that i.
Get asked all the time i've kind of.
Briefly touched on this in a few.
Different videos but you guys know i.
Love giving business advice and it's.
Like my favorite thing in the entire.
World so i thought i would answer this.
One today i think the reason that i did.
Grow so fast in the beauty industry it's.
Because of the looks that i started off.
Doing and i don't want to talk about me.
Being creative because i literally feel.
Like i talk about that in every video at.
This point i think that originality is.
Really what grooming to begin with and.
Is what's kept me relevant up until this.
Day i'm definitely someone who can take.
Pride in the fact that i do create a lot.
Of really really original concepts for.
My channel that i've been started a lot.
Of other people and a lot of other.
Creators as well and i just worked.
Really hard to come up with new concepts.
The whole time i'd like the makeup.
Industry its kind of hit a wall in the.
Sense that we've literally all seen.
Everything done like a million times are.
Like every single eyeshadow palette that.
Comes out i feel like is looking exactly.
The same like every single week there's.
A new challenge coming out that feels.
Like one of the other challenges that.
We've all seen i think what set me apart.
From a lot of different influences that.
I was doing something different and.
That's always the advice that i give to.
Up-and-coming artists or people who want.
To build a social media page is that you.
Have to do something different you have.
To do thing that's gonna set yourself.
Apart from everybody else with a little.
Bit of glam and a little bit of face.
Tune who's doing the same exact thing.
Because as blunt as it sounds.
Nobody's ever gonna make it with some.
Brown smokey eyes and some nude lips.
Like it sounds harsh to say that but at.
The end of the day there's a million.
Other people doing it so the only people.
Who are really succeeding and who are.
Gaining quickly are the ones who are.
Really setting themselves apart and.
Establishing themselves as both an.
Entertainer and an artist if that makes.
Sense.
I also callate - if you go into the.
Industry trying to grow and trying to.
Gain followers and that's your reasoning.
Behind doing the makeup in the first.
Place you're never gonna make it because.
It's gonna be really really obvious and.
Apparent to the people that are gonna be.
Following you whereas if you go into it.
Really focusing on your art and like i.
Said putting out a new original content.
That nobody's seen before.
The followers gonna come no matter what.
Because it's gonna be something.
Interesting that they're gonna want to.
Keep watching so i feel like you really.
Have to go into it with the different.
Lenses that everybody else and kind of.
Think like what can i bring to this.
Industry that doesn't already exist here.
And it's gonna be those people who.
Really think outside of the box and.
Think strategically that are gonna make.
It to the top a strass where have you.
Always wanted to go but never been able.
To oh that's actually i'm really good.
There's actually a lot of places that i.
Really really really want to travel to.
Um south africa was actually like my.
Number one place that i really wanted to.
Go to and that trip is now checked off.
The bucket list which was literally.
Amazing and also not so amazing at the.
Same time you guys all know why.

Excited to go to oh my god literally it.

Much fun hello i just want to travel and.
Just see all of my sisters all around.
The world sister priscilla asked who is.
The kind best celebrity you ever met wow.
Can't wait to answer this one because i.
Know it won't get me in twist.
Accountable but i probably actually have.
To say kim kardashian hands down she's.
Been absolutely incredible every single.
Time that i met her she definitely has a.
Little bit of a controversial public.
Figure but she doesn't let that get to.
Her and she's just really really funny.
She's unapologetically herself and she's.
A really really smart businesswoman and.
She's just really really nice all on top.
Of that and has always been nothing but.
Absolutely amazing i would really love.
To work with her one day so i definitely.
Love it sister kim handsome easy answer.
For that one.
All right guys i'm currently baking in.
The oven i'm gonna go into my brows.
Off-camera.
Sorry i literally cannot talk while.
Doing them i need to focus so hard core.
To make sure the eyebrows end up being.
Sensors and not like distant cousins.
Twice root because.
It happens let's be real so i'll be.
Right back in a few minutes to start off.
The eyes so starting on behinds today.
Like i said i'm doing a look inspired by.
A mobile of mitchell one of my all-time.
Favorite artists and he's a uk artist.
And uk artist use a lot of very.
Different techniques than ask american.
And us artists and their eye shadow.
Always looks away a bomber than ours so.
I definitely want to try a lot of the.
Different techniques today so i'm gonna.
Start off with the p louise eyeshadow.
Base this is a kind of similar textures.
Like the mac prolongwear concealer and.
I'm just going to pat this on using a a.
Flat concealer brush and then for my eye.
Shadow today i'm gonna be using the p.
Louise i shut up palette apparently.
Instead of really blending this in.
You're supposed to kind of a tap it in.
To place and what really is scaring and.
Worrying me about this is that none of.
The uk artists ever set their base they.
Go right in with the shadows of right on.
Top and kind of blend it even though.
It's still wet so i want to try to do.
That today i'm not sure how to nor turn.
Out but clearly they're doing something.
Right they're putting something in the.
Water over there that's always making.
The shadow look bomb so you know what.
We're gonna take risk so unless i throw.
My brush on the ground like i just did.
I'm gonna grab my morphe emma 511 brush.
I love this brush that is a really.
Really big fluffy brush and dip into the.
Shade p louise right here in the palette.
And i'm going to use this yellow shade.
As a transition shade and the outer.
Portion of the crease this i said look.
It's gonna be pretty complicated so i.
Don't really want to explain what i'm.
Doing so i'm gonna go back to answering.
Your guys's questions during the process.
And sister bobbie asked have you ever.
Unfollowed one of your fan accounts and.
Why and the answer to that is actually.
Yes i have one very specific incident in.
Mind and this was a very very hard.
Choice for me to make but i did have a.
Obvious reason for doing so and that.
Being that this person was being very.
Very mean to a lot of my other fan.
Accounts and we actually had an incident.
In the sister and a few days ago.
Regarding a very similar thing actually.
But after all the crap that i've been.
Hit with from bs of stand twitter and.
People online just hating me for no.
Reason and just being so nasty the.
Absolute last thing that i want you.
Sisters to be is mean to anybody even if.
Somebody's being the worst person in the.
World are being rude to you they're.
Being mean though.
To somebody else please i asked you guys.
Don't address it don't say anything just.
Be the bigger person and either be nice.
About it or just don't say anything at.
All if anything you guys know i'm.
Definitely a firm believer and allowing.
People to grow and change from their.
Mistakes and although the love from you.
Guys is always a really really intense.
And amazing.
They hate from the haters is also very.
Very intense and you guys know that for.
Sure so if the haters coming into the.
Sisterhood already having a bad feeling.
About us and feeling that we may be.
Really really dramatic or really really.
Scandalous or all have god-like kind of.
Mindset then we all think the same way.
Prove them wrong let's just all be is so.
Amazing and so nice to one another that.
All the haters come in or like oh oops.
These people are actually a really.
Really dope and james is awesome and all.
His fans are really really awesome as.
Well so like i was saying i haven't.
Followed a fan account before i'm not.
Happy about it i it paid me a lot to do.
So but at the end of the day this person.
Was being very very nasty to a lot of my.
Other friends who i also love and care.
Deeply about and that is never okay so.
Be nice share the love no matter what.
Even if somebody's not sharing the love.
Back because i guarantee it'll come back.
Around to both you and the positively.
And them in the negative life karma's a.
Sister zoe asked if you could.
Bring one thing from your house in new.
York and bring it to your apartment in.
La what would it be and why literally.
The answer this is so easy my dog benny.
Oh my god i miss him so much.
It is literally insane and for some.
Reason too i think there has been a very.
Very strange influx of dogs in my.
Apartment building recently it's really.
Just making me so sad and miss him so.
Much.
And you guys know like i've been trying.
To buy a house really badly and it's not.
Exactly working out but the first thing.
That i do when i get a house before i.
Even like my furniture is literally.
Getting a dog i cannot wait to adopt one.
Oh my god i am so beyond excited i need.
A dog right now in my life i really want.
To get like a husky pitbull mix like.
That just sounds the best and the entire.
World it's been on my agenda trust me.
Sisters tannaz if you had a launch your.
Own makeup line what would be the first.
Product that you would come out with oh.
That is totally so easy.
Definitely a 100% in eyeshadow palette.
You guys know eyeshadow is by far my.
Favorite part of my makeup routine and.
So i really feel like i can be super.
Super creative and always switch things.
Up and always push the boundaries i just.
Live for a good colorful moment.
I definitely have if you are really.
Really or really bomb ideas for palates.
They've never been done before either so.
You guys will have to stay tuned and see.
What happens i'm gonna take this.
Metallic light blue shade if i'm a 35 b.
You guys know this is my all-time.
Favorite palette from morphe with all.
The rainbows she's use go james for 10%.
Off this palette and all other amazing.
Morphe goodies and i'm gonna try to pop.
This on the lid maybe and this might.
Give us the similar look i'm scared.
Sister katie asks what is your current.
Favorite clothing brand oh that's.
Actually a really really good question.
And if you had asked me this literally.
Like six months ago my answer would have.
Been literally like per for 21 and top.
Man which is the most boring generic.
White boy answers ever but my answers.
Have now drastically changed and i'm.
Actually really happy about it because.
You guys know i definitely said i'm.
Getting this year that i want to take.
Fashion a way more seriously and really.
Get into it and just be really proud of.
The outfits that i wear because a lot of.
Times my face is looking a real beat but.
I'd wear the same hoodie and every.
Single picture ever which i'm sure it.
Got really really boring for you guys.
Were really really fast so right now i'm.
Really loving a lot of the different.
Trends that are going on involving like.
Modern street wear.
That's like my all-time favorite style.
Of fashion i just feel like it's so it's.
So so cute for me too i really love that.
Style because it's really fun to.
Experiment with it and it's like a very.
Very kind of more masculine street wear.
Type of outfit and then just a b ass.
Face right on top i said f gender.
Stereotypes it's very very heterogeneous.
And it's just really really cool to like.
Play on that and i just have really.
Really been loving it so recently i.
Really been loving the brand jeah the.
Label they are i think in australia.
Brent and their products are so done.
With actually wearing a shirt for them.
Right now this is like a really really.
Cute jacket i love laura's boutique use.
Coach a store 10% off that is actually.
My best friend's brand but they do have.
A lot of really really cute stuff that.
I've been wearing a lot recently there's.
Another brand that i've been wearing a.
Lot recently called medi cow they are a.
German brand and i actually just found.
Out that there's literally one girl who.
Runs the entire thing and the clothes.
Are so cute she means everything from.
Scratch if you guys want to go check it.
Out i will leave her stuff down below.
She is so talented.
Actually maybe don't check her out.
Because then she won't have time to make.
All my clothes but she was really good.
She definitely deserves the support i've.
Also been working with a lot of.
Different designers out here and i like.
To get costume.
Has made such as oh wow brian horns the.
Guy who made all my coachella looks and.
Literally slayed them is working on so.
Many cool things for you right now and i.
Am just so so so excited my bank account.
Is not because getting custom fashion is.
Ridiculous expensive but i'm definitely.
A firm believer in paying people for.
Their work especially when it's custom.
And really cool stuff like that and it's.
Just been really fun for me i really.
Like the world of fashion it's something.
That i've been very very interested in.
But i've never been very good at so i'm.
Definitely really excited to be working.
On it a lot more and just be having.
Really cool outfits that i'm really.
Confident in and feel really proud of.
Because honestly not gonna lie it's.
Something that i struggle with a lot so.
It's been a fun challenge for me and i'm.
Definitely looking forward to it a lot.
Sister rhea asked does it annoy you.
There's so many people on youtube use.
Sister all the time now the same that i.
Get asked all the time and i don't think.
I've ever actually addressed it on.
Camera but no matter what way you really.
Look at it no i don't mind it at all in.
Fact i actually really really love it.
Obviously it started off as like a.
Personal joke between me and my close.
Friends but when it came time to pick a.
Name for my fandom because i literally.
Hate the word fan more than anything in.
The entire world sisters made sense.
Because it was already what i call my.
Best friends and i like to think of you.
Guys as a far more than fans and kind of.
Like a close family that we all have.
Together so it made sense and if people.
Want to call it their fans sisters too.
That's super cute it just means we're.
All one big happy you to a family i.
Think it's super super fun and then also.
If you look at it from the other side as.
Well.
It's literally a free promotion which.
I'm definitely never gonna stray from at.
This point we've kind of reinvented the.
Word sisters i'm gonna say it we read.
About - the word sisters and it's how to.
Become like a meme at this point which i.
Am so down for now a lot of my being on.
Social media has literally been like.
Turning myself into a meme and then.
Profiting off at the hate so that's.
Definitely i'd like to do and sisters.
Has kind of become one of those memes at.
This point and now i'm known for being.
Hi sisters and i live for us so.
Everybody should say sisters all they.
Want.
I do wanna add a little bit more of a.
Pop just like how mitchell did on his.
Vision to look with some sister glitters.
So i'm gonna mix together a few at.
Different once it's just a white.
Translucent one this one is like a blue.
A green reflex steel type of one then.
I'm gonna add in a few of these little.
Holographic star glitters as well.
Right on top of the land.
Music.
For a lot of thing i'm gonna use the new.
Bounds i'm a dragon lee lash's.
These are definitely much bolder and.
Bigger than what i usually would wear.
For a lily lash miami but i feel like.
These will definitely match the look of.
Really really well today and they.
Survived me of the style that all the uk.
Artists use i have not been more proud.
And more excited for an eyeshadow look.
In a very very long time so i'm gonna go.
Ahead and do the other one on camera.
Quickly and i'll be right back to finish.
Off the rest of the look and answer a.
Few more juicy scissor questions whoo.
All right sisters we are back that took.
Me a hot minute to mirror this i.
Overtook this one but i think we got.
Them pretty close i am literally in love.
With this look and i'm so excited to.
Finish it i want to take selfies right.
Now so let's go ahead and move on and.
Finish up next up is obviously gonna be.
The glow but before we do that i think i.
Want to answer one last question from.
You guys so let's go ahead and see this.
One is from sister johan and he said.
Tells the story of you getting caught.
Tickling your pickle oh my god do i want.
To tell the story right now this they.
Were before starting the story to my.
Younger audience out there especially.
Parents if you're watching with your.
Children um hi mom and dad by the way.
That's awesome that you guys watch with.
Your kids hello you rock best parents.
Ever this story is not exactly the most.
Pg you guys know you have a very very.
Family-friendly channel i will do my.
Best to kind of you out certain words.
And tell the story in the best way.
Possible it does however have a very.
Very important message behind it so.
Choosing your own well i'm telling you.
Right now this may be inappropriate but.
You already saw most of the makeup look.
If you want to click off because you.
Don't want to hear this i don't blame.
You but let's jump into the story if.
You've been a longtime subscriber in.
Mind any watch a lot of my videos i've.
Alluded to the fact a few times here and.
There that i may or may not have been.
Caught when i was younger doing my.
Business and if you've also been a.
Longtime subscriber you would know that.
I've never actually told my coming-out.
Story because i've said that there was.
Legal problems with it i didn't know if.
I could really tell them without getting.
In trouble and what people don't know is.
That those two stories are actually the.
Same story.
When i was younger i think and around.
Sixth grade i was 12 years old at the.
Time i was.
Hormonal i had just gone through puberty.
And just like every other boy i was.
Going through that stage of life clearly.
At this point in my own head i had.
Figured out that okay i was not exactly.
Interested in the sisters and was.
Definitely done for the brothers so here.
We go you guys know that i've definitely.
Always been very very active on social.
Media and at this time period i was.
Active on tumblr at the time there was a.
Lot of really really famous bloggers.
That i loved and looked up to and one.
Website that all these famous bloggers.
Would always go on to meet their fans.
Was called omegle which is an online.
Chatroom.
I remember gonna make literally all the.
Time and sitting there for hours.
Clicking through different strangers.
Trying to find at different famous.
Bloggers that i really really loved and.
Wanted to meet and just wanted to talk.
To you for a few short seconds and.
Ironically enough i don't think i ever.
Once met anybody who i was looking for.
Because there was always a thousands of.
Thousands and thousands people online.
But when they're scrolling through.
Strangers video cameras on an anonymous.
Live video cam website i'm sure you can.
Imagine what i started to come across as.
A hormonal twelve-year-old thinking.
About this is making me want to die i.
Quickly realized that although a lot of.
People on tumblr we're using the site to.
Meet their fans and meet new friends.
That a lot of people were using omegle.
For different purposes and through.
Realizing this i also started using home.
Agel for different purposes if you get.
What i'm putting on the table here oh my.
God.
So me and sister-in are three years.
Apart and the way the school system was.
Divided is we had elementary school.
Middle school and high school so during.
Middle school when i was in sixth grade.
And this is all going on he was still in.
Elementary school meeting every single.
Day i would have an extra guarantee one.
Hour from when i got off the bus at home.
To when he would get off the bus at home.
Since he was coming from a different.
School once i kind of figured out the.
Schedule and how to really finesse the.
Whole situation the visits to omegle.
Became more and more frequent until they.
Were literally a daily occurrence which.
Thinking about it now is literally so.
Repulsive but at the time i'm not even.
Gonna lie i was definitely like addicted.
To it it was a fun challenge for me.
Which is so like psychotic to think.
About but i was 12 i was very very.
Hormonal i was going through puberty and.
That's why i'm telling this story now.
Because obviously it's a very very.
Serious and scary thing that i don't.
Want any of you guys to go through so.
Snob also as well very very important.
Thing to know i was a minor at the time.
I was obviously at 12 years old but i.
Never once ever ever ever ever ever got.
Naked on camera and to this day i have.
Still never sent a dickey d piketty.
That's for personal reasons but every.
Single time it would always be a guy who.
Was above age doing his business and.
Then when he would ask me to take my.
Clothes i thought oh he's be like oh my.
Camera's broken i don't know what's.
Going on i won't turn on what the heck.
This is so where this has never happened.
Before so i could avoid obviously taking.
My clothes off which i did not want to.
Do and do not want to blind anybody with.
And also of course breaking the law so.
Although this is a horrible idea i did.
Not break any laws which is great.
Obviously but once again still please do.
Not do this literally ever anyways like.
I was saying this became a very very.
Routine i was doing this all the time.
And i was getting very very good at it.
Until one night that will go down in.
History forever setting the scene it was.
10 p.m. on a school.
Night one night ian was already asleep.
Because he was much younger than i was.
And my mom was already asleep as well.
Because she always was a bad very very.
Early for some reason so the only people.
Wake in the house for myself and my dad.
And my dad always would chill in his.
Living room watching football or.
Watching the news super super late at.
Night every single night and his living.
Room was right below my bedroom in our.
House i remember very very vividly i was.
Writing an essay for a history class.
That i absolutely hate it and in the.
Middle of it i took a break to do my.
Business so i went on to omegle calm.
Started searching through people.
Eventually found someone and there we go.
Things got started and all of a sudden.
In the middle of my business.
Tickling the pickle my door slams open.
And there's my father in the doorway.
Looking at very concerned and there is.
Me standing right in front of my.
Computer which is in the same line of.
View as my door.
Butt-naked with the screen lit up right.
In front of me and all he said was you.
Need to turn that off and go to bed.
Right now.
So i said got it sir good night love you.
The most and i read my little naked butt.
Into my bed and shut my eyes and cry.
Myself to sleep the next morning i woke.
Up one downstairs for breakfast took a.
Shower and.
Nothing happened nothing was different.
My dad did not look at me different my.
Mom did not know what was going on i.
Said yeah and i was so confused and also.
Obviously like literally having a panic.
Attack the entire day of freaking out.
Wondering what was gonna go on did he.
See anything clearly he saw something of.
Mine but did he see anything on the.
Computer screen so i was freaking out.
All day long said nothing go to school.
All day long awesome and periods nothing.
No texts nada obviously i know that.
Something is going to go down and.
They're going to say something but i.
Didn't know when i didn't know what they.
Were going to do and i i just didn't.
Know another time i was so freaked out.
And i was so nervous than when i got.
Home from school that day i didn't even.
Go upstairs i literally santos's that i.
Think i was like drawing a picture or.
Something.
You guys don't used to draw all the time.
Was all my favorite hobbies that was one.
Of the only things that i could do.
Before i really had makeup to kind of.
Escape and to just really focus on my.
Creativity and love the outside world go.
Away because at that moment i just.
Wanted to disappear into a hole and.
Never come out.
Well behold when both my parents get.
Home they say sister james well i was.
Just changed at the time but james we.
Need to talk please come with us.
Upstairs and instantly as soon as i.
Walked upstairs to them and said that my.
Bed and started talking i realized oh my.
God this entire time i've been so.
Nervous that i have not touched my.
Computer since last night when i jumped.
From my computer chair 70 feet across my.
Bedroom straight into my bed butt-naked.
Meaning i did not clear my internet.
History so sitting there talking to them.
The entire time i was already freaking.
Out but now i'm really freaking out.
Because i'm realizing oh my god if my.
Dad did not see anything now he's really.
Gonna see something so of course the.
First thing that comes out of their.
Mouth is we would love to check your.
Internet history my heart literally sunk.
Faster than the titanic and that walk.
From my bed over to the computer.
Turning on typing in my password going.
To google chrome opening the internet.
History and it being right there right.
At the top was probably the hardest 10.
Seconds of my entire life i can.
Literally see the disappointment in my.
Parents face and they clicked on omegle.
And there was the blog website and what.
Made it even worse that i literally.
Forgot about once again on the front.
Pages you can put an intro.
Of the different topics that you'd want.
To talk about so for example soccer.
Football webkinz club penguin at the.
Time or the names of 12 and 13 year old.
Bloggers that i was trying to find but.
Now instead right there on the front.
Page was about a ten word list.
Consisting of gay by men boys and woo.
There was the closet door was flung open.
And outran me unintentionally i remember.
Hensley started balling as any child.
Would because i was obviously.
Embarrassed that they caught me doing.
This but also now because i was out of.
The closet and in this current moment i.
Was not exactly ready to fly myself out.
Like that but thinking about it now i'm.
Actually kind of thankful that this did.
Happen as crazy as that sounds because.
The conversation after is probably one.
Of the coolest conversation i've ever.
Had at my parents in my entire life i.
Love them the most we've always been.
Very very close with this conversation.
Meant a lot to me because instead of.
Freaking out about me being gay and my.
Dad is very very catholic as well so.
That was something that i was super.
Super scared about the conversation was.
Very obviously more tailored towards.
Please don't do this this is so.
Dangerous there were predators out there.
Like you are putting yourself at such a.
Major risk and we don't want to see you.
Either get in trouble or get hurt and.
I'm so thankful for that because from.
That day on i never once did it again.
And i've always been so careful about.
That i've always been a very very huge.
Advocate for myself and my friends about.
Online pornography and chat rooms like.
That but whoo that moment of my life is.
Probably one of these scariest things.
That i've ever had a deal with it was so.
Horrifying it was embarrassing it was.
Sad it was just a lot of emotions going.
On at one time and i'm so thankful to my.
Parents hilda and the way that they did.
But yeah that's how i got caught doing.
My business on a chatroom with the.
Camera off thank god and that is also.
How i came out of the closet to my.
Parents i literally cannot believe i.
Just said this all in a video i had.
Never told this story publicly ever once.
In my entire life but i think that this.
Does have a very important message.
Behind it obviously it was very very.
Embarrassing at the time and thank god.
We my family can laugh about it now.
Several several years later dad i love.
You the most.
Tell you how to see that but i think.
This story does have a very very very.
Important message behind of internet.
Safety parents and kids if you guys are.
Still watching this through all of it.
Congratulations.
Love you.
Please be careful as to what you do.
Online please do not send risky pictures.
To anybody if you have text via snapchat.
Via any app that is currently popular.
Right now it is so incredibly dangerous.
You never know what they're doing with.
That picture that you get screenshot it.
They could scream record they could take.
A picture even though their phone so.
It's on the deal and you would never.
Ever ever know until it comes back ten.
Years later as blackmail and it's just.
So dangerous and so so so stupid you.
Never know who's watching you never know.
Who's recording you never know what.
People's true intentions are there are.
Some really really really crappy people.
Out there and please learn from your.
Mistakes it's dangerous and it's very.
Very embarrassing if you get caught so.
Don't do that and story time complete.
Whoo.
And last but finally not least after.
Filming this for four hours and it's.
Been a long time since i've been this.
Obsessed with the makeup look on my face.
So i definitely need to set it and lock.
It in place for the rest of the night so.
I'm gonna grab the screen to navy eye.
Makeup finishing spray and get wake up a.
Hobby spreads all over to make sure i am.
Locked in and ready just go you guys all.

Money off your purchase i think it's.

Definitely enough questions for today.
