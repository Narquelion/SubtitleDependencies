Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel.
2017 was an absolutely crazy here and i.
Am so beyond thankful to all of you.
Sisters chose to stay with me through it.
Let's talk about it.
Music.
Ironically enough this year started was.
Something that didn't exactly happen.
This year as most of you already know on.
October 11th of 2016 i officially became.
The world's first cover boy.
We broke history by becoming the first.
Male ambassador for a major beauty brand.
And the world was shook my mother's.
Event didn't take place in 2017.
However this opportunity changed my life.
Forever and my year probably would have.
Been very very boring without it in the.
Beginning of the year i made a huge.
Change in my life by graduating early.
And moving to los angeles at age 17 it.
Was a tough choice to make but my hard.
Work in school allowed for it and my.
Parents knew deep down that it was the.
Right decision for me i found my dream.
Apartment after only a few tours and.
Ended up moving in only a couple of days.
Later i literally had so much fun.
Decorating and making it my own despite.
The fact that i never actually films an.
Apartment tour even though i promised.
You guys a million times.
Oops coming soon baby not gonna lie.
Living alone at such a young age is a.
Little bit spooky i do live the freedom.
And i've always been a very very.
Independent and strong person but it.
Does get lonely i probably would not.
Have been able to survive here had i not.
Met my best friend laura milano her.
Family took me in as one of their own.
For almost four months before i.
Officially moved here and those people.
Literally mean the entire world to me i.
Also meant the original sisters who.
Became my close family security blanket.
And security guards at my meet and.
Greets as many of you guys know from.
Following your favorite youtubers.
Personal lives and drama ellie doesn't.
Exactly have the best track record for.
Genuine people but luckily along with.
Laura and the sisters i've been able to.
Surround myself with some positive.
Hard-working individuals and make some.
Amazing friendships along the way this.
Year i met tati westbrook another very.
Special friend of mine she's the mom of.
The youtube makeup world and also like a.
Mother figure to me she's helped me.
Become a better and wiser person and has.
Given me literally all the makeup.
Knowledge i could ever ask for.
Last january talk to you in her.
Now-husband james flew me to hawaii to.
Do her wedding makeup which is an.
Experience i will never forget a long.
Stead of tottie's wedding video i also.
Cloud with some other really cool people.
This year i did a few videos of laura's.
Husband who you guys know as danny the.
Road was also not ready for the.
Introduction of my little brother to my.
Youtube channel.
Better known as sister yet brother i am.
Truly blessed to have such strong.
Masculine men in my life that are.
Comfortable and loving enough to.
Publicly support me and my career.
It truly does mean so much speaking of.
Masculine men i was graced with the.
Opportunity of filming with the loves of.
My life and future husbands the dolan.
Twins our relationship started from me.
Leaving thursday comments on their.
Instagram pages but it now blows my mind.
To think that they are two of my closest.
Friends collabs are my favorite videos.
To film and i'm very proud of the.
Content that i was able to create with.
Some of my favorite contact craters that.
I've always looked up to not only did i.
Get to work with some dope youtubers but.
I also got to meet a few celebrities.
That have had a major impact on my life.
I met kim kardashian and ariana grande.
Culture for the first time her makeup.
Artist and one of my personal role.
Models margit ivanovitch had told her.
That i was there and she said her.
Security guard to escort me to meet her.
My heart was racing at a million miles.
Per hour but i somehow managed to pull.
It together and i couldn't stop smiling.
For literally the entire next week i.
Must have been annoying enough that she.
Didn't forget me because when she lost.
Her beauty line at k'kaw beauty i was.
Invited to her house to celebrate i've.
Always looked up to kim because despite.
What any tabloids or media has to say.
About her she's a genius and a classy.
Businesswoman and genuinely a super kind.
Person i also made a friendship with in.
My opinion the most talented vocalist of.
Our generation.
Demi lovato she followed me on instagram.
And i said him to her dm's and.
Miraculously she replied we started.
Discussing everything from her new music.
To my new makeup looks too even on.
Internet memes how can we forget pute.
Lovato she invited me to her documentary.
Premiere a few weeks ago where i finally.
Got to meet her in person and we took an.
Iconic photo and i could think her for.
All she's done for me while this year.
Was filled with many highs and also had.
Some major lows and at one point i.
Quickly went from everyone's favorite.
Cover boy to the most problematic.
Youtuber of all time in february i went.
On a trip to south africa with some.
Friends from school that i had been.
Saving up for and looking forward to for.
Four years prior before the plane could.
Even depart the runway i made a joke.
About.
Ebola and my friend thought i was.
Talking about the food virus ecoli.
I tweeted about her mistake without.
Thinking twice and the plane took off.
When we landed just one hour later in dc.
For a layover i remember checking.
Twitter and my heart dropping to the.
Floor a news article was written and.
Went viral titled cover boy james.
Charles says that the only thing africa.
Has to offer is ebola i was so confused.
And my first reaction was to fight back.
Being that my tweet had no harmful.
Intentions and i was now under public.
Scrutiny i tried to brush it off and.
Make a quick apology but after 26 hours.
Of flying and no internet access about.
The atlantic ocean i quickly realized i.
Had messed up big time and that there.
Was no going back i remember spending.
The first day in my hotel room in africa.
Sobbing alone thousands of miles away.
From the people that i loved the most.
And unable to communicate or defend.
Myself to the thousands of people.
Following me online it was a rough few.
Days but there was one day on the trip.
That changed my life and perspective.
Forever we visited a high school called.
Edge maine and i remember watching a.
Live drum performance for the music kids.
At the school in the middle of.
Performance the principal came in and.
Interrupted pass for someone named james.
Charles i vividly remember my heart.
Stopping and my first instinct was that.
They heard in my tweet and we're gonna.
Ask me to leave but to my surprise he.
Opened the door to the auditorium and.
There was a huge crowd of kids outside.
That had left their classes because they.
Had heard about my arrival and wanted to.
Meet me i instantly started crying as i.
Took photos while smiling and meeting.
All these kids we started off by talking.
About how our school systems differ from.
Each other but we quickly got very very.
Comfortable and started talking about.
Everything under the sun we talked about.
Our everyday lives what we like to do.
For fun boy and dating drama pop culture.
And i was even able to have an open and.
Honest conversation with some of the.
Kids about my tweet and how it affected.
Them from that day on at my life.
Literally took a 360 degree turn and my.
Africa trip consisted of some of the.
Best memories of my life my tweets from.
White house are definitely not something.
That i'm proud of.
But being called out for them has.
Allowed me to educate myself and become.
A genuinely better person and are not an.
Accurate representation of who i am.
Today.
Aside from me growing and becoming a.
Better person there is no denying that.
I've become a far better artist this.
Year back in march i took a flash photo.
With a sister named pam a tammy agree.
And after being filtered it turned out a.
Little bit ghostly the photo quickly got.
Into the hands of stan twitter and was.
Enter.
And d saturated and thus flashback mary.
Was born at first i was upset by the.
Poor representation of my makeup skills.
And everyone laughing at me but i.
Quickly learned to laugh with everyone.
Instead.
I turned my hate into profit by making.
One of my most successful videos on my.
Channel of all time recreating my memes.
Okay flashback mary flashback mary.
Flashback mary deep down i think that.
Flashback mary was a blessing in.
Disguise although it sucked at the time.
My recreating my memes video definitely.
Got my creative juices flowing and.
Therefore opened the door for more.
Entertaining based content on my youtube.
Channel i can honestly look back and say.
That i am really really proud of the.
Videos that i put out this year the.
Beauty community can sometimes get over.
Flooded with repetitive tutorials and.
Challenges and i definitely set the bar.
High and change the excitation for.
Beauty videos some of my favorites that.
I did this year include my makeover.
Series where i got my makeup done an.
Ulta sephora and mac which opened my.
Eyes to different styles and techniques.
Used by various artists testing fake.
Makeup where i compared knockoff.
Products to the real versions of the.
Most popular makeup items of the time.
Take her swimming on the first day where.
I tested waterproof makeup products by.
Jumping into a pool makeup versus the.
Iphone acts face it where i tested the.
Capabilities of the brand-new iphone on.
The same day that it launched and.
Finally singing my makeup routine an.
Original challenge series in which i.
Improv through some of my favorite songs.
Allowing me to combine two of my.
All-time favorite passions music and.
Makeup.
Speaking of music i also worked on my.
Voice a lot this year i was able to show.
You guys a whole other realm of james.
Alongside a few fun instagram carbs one.
Of my best friends anthony i also.
Started an acapella group called.
Flashback we've only released two songs.
So far but i've accumulated more than 3.
Million views on our videos that have.
Had a ton of sales and are so excited to.
Keep working on more music in the future.
Music plays a huge role in my life and.
Is now a huge part of the james charles.
Brand if you will which is developed.
Immensely sisters has quickly become one.
Of the most popular words on social.
Media what started off as a term of.
Endearment between my close friends that.
I.
We became my catchphrase which i.
Eventually turned is my very own.
Clothing line sister's apparel we've.
Only had a few launches so far but have.
Sold thousands and thousands of sisters.
Gear sisters all around the globe and i.
Look forward to working at my fashion.
Sense and clothing line once more in.
2018 i know y'all are getting a little.
Bit tired of me wearing the same for.
Hardee's on a daily basis trust me me.
Too.
I mentioned earlier that i graduated in.
January but in june i flew back home to.
Little old bethlehem new york to get my.
Diploma with the rest of my class i've.
Worked extremely hard in school and took.
All advanced courses all while balancing.
My at the time a small instagram career.
And a job at a frozen yogurt shop i.
Decided not to continue my education and.
To work as a youtuber full-time but.
Walking to get my diploma and my.
Custom-made michael costello sawasdee.
Crystal jumpsuit was one of the most.
Fulfilling moments of my entire life.
Education is super important to me and i.
Am so thankful that i had a supportive.
School system laura's family actually.
Flew all the way across america with me.
To watch my special moment alongside of.
My real family and some of you guys even.
Snuck into i've actually had a lot of.
Opportunities this year to meet and hugs.
So many of you guys face-to-face and i.
Look forward to so many more in 2018.
I had an impromptu meeting great in the.
Middle of new york city and over a.
Thousand and you guys showed up even.
Though i only announced it on snapchat a.
Day before i also went to playlist dc.
And almost got kicked out oopsies i.
Turned 18 this year and finally became a.
Legal adult which means absolutely.
Nothing because you guys know i don't.
Really smoke party or drink but i did.
Choose to celebrate my birthday with all.
Of you guys at the murphy store here in.
California and it was absolutely.
Incredible.
Working with brands such as murphy this.
Year has been such a huge honor and has.
Made both my social media accounts grow.
But also my knowledge of business it is.
Truly incredible to be working firsthand.
And receiving products of some of the.
Most famous brands and beauty when i.
Couldn't even afford some of their.
Products a year ago i absolutely loved.
Working in all their products and you.
Guys are always hearing me to tell you.
Use coaches for tempers they loved your.
Purchase i even put it on a sweatshirt i.
Had an opportunity to model for a little.
Holiday campaign this year which was.
Super exciting my makeup was done by.

Favorite artists with the shoe and the.
Photos honestly turned out incredible i.
Was so happy to be the face of their.
Palette and you can now catch me and all.
My favorites and all the different more.

Huge honor although it wasn't a.
Collaboration who really knows that 2018.
May have in store.

Cosmetics one of my all-time favorite.
Brands they took laura and i and a ton.
Of other influencers to necker island.
