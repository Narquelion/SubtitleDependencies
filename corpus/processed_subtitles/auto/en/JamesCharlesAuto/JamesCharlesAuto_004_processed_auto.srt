Hi sisters.
Welcome to the official 2020 house tour.
Actually no no no don't show that just.
Yet.
In honor of hitting 20 million.
Subscribers we're giving away.
Okay now that you guys have seen the.
Upstairs and the bedrooms and also the.
Main floor.
There's still one floor left of the.
House that i have not yet.
Shown you guys ever since i started.
Doing youtube about four or five years.
Ago now.
I have been dreaming of what it would be.
Like to have the perfect.
Sister's headquarters we've been.
Renovating for months.
And i'm so excited to tell you guys that.
Those dreams have finally.
Come true when i was looking to buy my.
First ever house it was really important.
To me that i was able to have a good.
Work life balance but for me since my.
Work takes up so much of my life it was.
Really hard to actually find that so we.
Found this house that had a basement it.
Was like literally.
A message from heaven above and i knew.
That this was going to be the one.
Because we were able to turn this.
Basement.
Into the dream sisters headquarters and.
I'm so excited to show.
You guys there's a lot that i want to.
Show you so let's go ahead and get.
Started with the first room which is.
The sister cinema.
Music.
Applause.
Sure you guys obviously all know trevor.
Andrew.
We're here in the movie theater which is.
Like i can't believe that that sentence.
Just left my mouth like the fact that i.
Have a movie theater in my house.
Is so cool it's not even funny this was.
Actually not on like my.
Requirements list when shopping for.
Homes but i certainly am not complaining.
This is like.
The best thing to ever happen to us as.
You can see we have a bunch of different.
Reclining chairs that do actually.
Recline.
Would you like to demonstrate trevor of.
Course oh yeah sure.
Oh this goes right back favorite.
Projector with a big screen obviously.
There.
We have some gorgeous candies instead of.
Gorgeous i love gorgeous skin.
Some delicious candies really lined up.
So you can pick your favorite a popcorn.
Machine over here as well so literally.
Any snack that you could possibly.
Want to indulge in a gorgeous snack if.
You will.
We have right here in the cinema well.
I'll let you two boys watch.
This for some reason.
Coming out of the theater right over.
Here we have the conference room which i.
Actually was not really expecting to use.
That often.
In the last house we honestly had a lot.
Of our meetings in like the kitchen and.
The living room.
But this has been really really helpful.
To just kind of separate once again.
Living and working.
And my team and i have meetings in here.
Literally all the time we have this.
Massive table a bunch of different.
Dining chairs we also have a tv on the.
Wall which normally is.
Not playing my videos it's for airplay.
Any like presentations or projects or.
Anything.
And also for virtual zoom calls we have.
An acrylic board over there for any.
Calendaring and planning then finally.
Two different art prints from different.
Exciting moments in my career.
Okay so coming out of the conference.
Room we have don't fit into this just.
Yet.
And over here in this hallway is the.
Sister salaam now this is once again.
A room that i didn't expect to have in.
This house but i'm definitely not.
Complaining.
It is so cool in here obviously being a.
Beauty guru beauty related tasks are a.
Huge part of my calendar and daily life.
So this room is like the perfect place.
For all that to happen we have these.
Massive beautiful vanities for.
Impressions with barber chairs as well.
So i use this area to get ready and also.
Get my hair cut which is.
So nice in the last house i was getting.
Ready and filming in the same studio.
Which was you know not the end of the.
World but it would literally look like a.
Tornado had gone through it every single.
Day which was an absolute.
Nightmare so now i get to separate.
Getting glam for fun.
And actually filming videos we also have.
A table over here where i get my nails.
Done with.
Chad you guys saw that in the long nails.
For a day video which was absolutely.
Crazy.
We have our 1 million and our 10 million.
Plaques and then finally we have this.
Beautiful wall of fully sound wings.
Ready to go if i ever need to do a.
Transformation now you guys have seen.
The movie theater the conference room.
And the salon and there's one more room.
That i need to show you guys in the.
Basement and it is my favorite room of.
The entire.
House having a master production space.
Has been a dream of mine for so.
Long now when i first started doing.
Youtube videos almost four years ago i.
Was filming in a little corner my.
Parents paste it with just two soft.
Boxes finally in this house i can.
Finally say that i have my dream.
Production.
Space come on in to sister studios.
Music.
Okay so obviously this space is.
Absolutely massive this is definitely.
Where most of the renovations took place.
And you're probably wondering james how.
Did you end up with a production studio.
In.
Your basement and that is a great.
Question when we first moved in.
Fun fact this entire area was actually.
An indoor pool which is.
Yes a subtle flex but was just so.
Unnecessary to me so we decided to fill.
It in.
Put it in hardwood floors and now this.
Is the absolute dream.
Studio space as you guys can see right.
Over here i have my full-on.
Camera setup which is such an upgrade.
From the last studio i am such a massive.
Nerd for production at heart so it has.
Honestly been.
So much fun for me to challenge myself.
And to try to keep upgrading our studios.
And our setup to ultimately make the.
Best content for you guys.
We have our camera and our tripod we.
Have our monitors the microphone.
The diffuser the big lights everything.
From the backdrop and it is all hanging.
From the ceiling as well which makes it.
So.
Much cleaner if i sit down to film a.
Video this is what you guys see.
I have a monitor in front of me to see.
What i'm doing there's a monitor behind.
The camera for lewis and there's also.
A tv right over there so any guests can.
See it as well.
Which is super awesome i always like to.
Have a lot of people in the room when.
They film my videos and our last studio.
Was really small and crowded which.
Became a problem quite a lot so it was.
Really important for this face that we.
Were able to have a seating area.
We have our couch and chairs and then.
Also like i was saying this tv here as.
Well.
Which is great for anybody that comes.
Over has a team or assistance along with.
Them.
They can sit and get work done and also.
Have easy access to see what's going on.
Behind the camera as well opposite the.
Sitting area next to the filming setup.
We also have another paper backdrop.
System.
And this is for photos we have the same.
Exact camera and the same exact lens.
Some more lights as well and just a fun.
Little backdrop so you're able to shoot.
Photos for assistance apparel or any.
Other photo shoots that we have going on.
Which is honestly really really helpful.
As well so therefore we don't have to.
Keep doing everything around taking.
Lights up and down.
It's honestly just such a hassle so this.
Just makes everything so much easier.
And i cannot wait to see what magic.
We're going to create in this photo.
Studio.
Moving right along to this wall we have.
Two very very special rooms.
And these are the sister studios but not.
The video studios.
The recording studio these used to be a.
Steam room and a sauna once again for.
The indoor pool.
But we really wanted to make it much.
More personal and you guys know how much.
Of a big part of my life.
Music is so we figured it'd be only.
Appropriate to build out the ultimate.
Recording studio.
To mix the music one day it is not done.
Quite yet we're still waiting on some.
Equipment and furniture but.
We are so close and it's looking so good.
So far.
The walls are fully padded and.
Soundproof we have a custom desk built.
We also have these really cool clouds in.
The ceiling from the brand room cloud.
They gifted them to us and it just.
Creates such a fun vibe in here and i.
Cannot wait to see what we're going to.
Create in here as well.
One day very very soon and then right.
Next door to the mixing room we also.
Have the recording room.
Which is.
Music.
Obviously very secure door very.
Soundproof in here so you can record.
Vocals and nobody's going to hear it.
Some more of ib clouds and then you have.
A window so i can see lewis yelling at.
Me telling me that my pitch is wrong.
From the other room all right you guys.
And the last place that i want to show.
You in the sister studio.
Is the sister store so many fun s words.
This like i was saying.
Used to be the indoor pool so this is.
Actually the indoor gym.
But now this is the stuff.
This is the storage room so it was.
Really important to me that we were able.
To create an area oh look at trevor just.
Being such a good employer working at.
The store.
It was really important for me that we.
Were able to create an area not only for.
Storage of sisters apparel.
But also for all of our makeup stuff as.
Well as you guys can see this entire.
Wall is all different makeup items that.
I have in my collection.
Once again similar to the pantry.
Organized by the queen herself.
Have all of our categories foundations.
Powders brow stuff we have.
Palettes tools we have all these eye.
Glitters and eye tools we have.
Lashes lipsticks literally everything in.
My collection is beautifully displayed.
So i know exactly where it is and i can.
Pull it really easily if i need to go.
Film a video out in the studio and then.
On the other side of the room we have an.
Entire wall dedicated to sister's.
Apparel we have all of our different.
Colored hoodies that we've released.
And we also always have our current.
Collections as well it was super.
Important to us to have a full on stock.
Because friends and family come over.
Literally.
All the time and are complaining to us.
That the last collection sold out way.
Too fast.
That they need their hoodie so whenever.
We have friends or guests over we could.
Always put together cute goodie bags or.
We also have the full collection.
For giveaways for you guys we love love.
Love doing giveaways and sending out.
Packages to all of you sisters whether.
It be on the sister's apparel account.
Which you definitely need to follow or.
My own account.
If you guys did not know fun fact i've.
Been giving away 500.
To whoever comments the secret emoji on.
My instagram photos make sure you follow.
Charlie to post notifications to all my.
Social media platforms because we.
Absolutely love.
Sending you guys packages thank you.
Trevor can you pop her in the mail for.
Me.
Good to go sounds good speaking of.
Giveaways you guys make sure you keep.
Watching to the end of today's video for.
A 20 million subscriber special.
I think at this point that is the.
Basement all complete which means.
The house is all complete but there's.
Still one last place to take you guys.
And that is upstairs to the backyard.
Music.
Okay you guys just like the basement the.
Backyard literally looked.
Nothing like this when we first moved in.
Because it underwent a lot of different.
Renovations.
And this is probably the space that i'm.
Most excited about i know i keep saying.
That but literally like i just love all.
The spaces.
And i'm so excited to share with you.
Guys the last house in the last yard was.
Really not it for a lot of different.
Reasons the first one being it was just.
Too small not for us but for fit again.
The last yard was so tiny but now we.
Have this entire space dedicated to this.
Little one.
Running around having the time of his.
Life with all of his toys and he has.
Never been.
Happier also as you can see there is a.
Massive pool which has been.
Incredible in the last house we were.
Really never in the pool because of the.
Way that it was positioned in the yard.
Anytime after like noon when the sun.
Starts to go down it was completely in.
The shade so the pool was always cold we.
Were never in it but.
This pool is not the case at all it is.
Huge and it is smack dab in the middle.
Of the yard.
It gets done all day long and we have.
Been spending so many days.
Chilling by the pool or just swimming.
And it has been literally like a dream.
Come true now i want to take you guys.
Over to this side of the yard because.
This is where most of the changes took.
Place.
And i am literally in love this is like.
The outdoor kitchen and.
Seating area now when we first moved.
Into the house there was actually two.
Different pool houses.
One right here and one over there where.
The fireplace is now which you'll see in.
A second a lot of times builders in la.
Will add guest houses or pool houses to.
Their properties.
Just because they can add square footage.
To the listing which literally equates.
To hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Sometimes which is.
Like mind-blowing to me it's truly a.
Sister scam and obviously i had.
No reason for either one of them so we.
Converted the first pool house into an.
Outdoor kitchen which turned out.
Absolutely.
Sunny we have these beautiful black.
Countertops and bar stools so my friends.
And i can sit out here and eat if the.
Boys are over.
And grilling some nice delicious meats.
Um we have.
An outdoor fridge and we also have a tv.
As well which does rotate so we can.
Watch music videos or the boys can watch.
Sport games.
During our outdoor barbecues we have.
These four trees that surround the.
Outdoor eating area.
Along with string lights as well which i.
Feel like creates just like a magical.
Vibe.
And i really like how it feels a little.
Bit more separated from the rest of the.
Yard as well.
We went with a massive concrete dining.
Table in the middle with a ton of.
Different seats around it so we can all.
Have family dinners.
When the backyard was finally finished.
My friends and i decided to cook for.
Once in our lives.
And set up a cute little dining table.
Out here i think i posted on my.
Instagram stories actually and we ate.
Dinner.
And then brought out some card games and.
Stuff and we ended up being out here.
Losing chocolate time until like three.
In the morning.
It was so much fun it was such a good.
Vibe and that's how you know you've.
Created a magical space.
Now if you guys follow me right along.
This way next to the outdoor kitchen we.
Have a cute little ping pong table.
For nice games we have three little.
Trees as well which are babies right now.
But will eventually be limes lemons and.
Oranges for our citrus in the morning.
And then this is a really fun part of.
The backyard as well.
This is our outdoor fireplace so right.
Here used to be the other.
Pool house as well which we ended up.
Removing but now it is this beautiful.
Sit-in full stucco white fireplace and i.
Am.
Absolutely obsessed we've already had so.
Many fun nights roasting marshmallows by.
The fire and just sitting in here and.
Talking and relaxing and a much better.
Use of the space than what was here.
Before.
Also i mentioned in the last video that.
I really wanted to give shout outs to.
The people that made this home.
Renovation project rewarding instead of.
Stressful.
And one person that i definitely owe a.
Ton of thanks to.
Is jonathan juan with racing green.
Construction he literally.
Took this backyard from drab to fab and.
I do mean that literally just like.
Leclaire decor as soon as jonathan and.
Racing green came onto the project it.
Was like magic waiting to happen and i.
Was just so.
So grateful every single step of the way.
Their team was professional.
Super fast and just honestly cared a lot.
As well this is obviously my first home.
Purchase which was.
Really exciting but really really scary.
As well there are so many things.
That you would never like expect to deal.
With being a homeowner i know that i.
Didn't expect to deal with obviously.
Jonathan and his team were amazing at.
Construction.
But i also just want to say a major.
Thank you to him because he truly kind.
Of like took on a fatherly role with me.
With this whole process.
Which just made it so much easier and.
Way more fun as well so to jonathan i.
Love you the opposite most.
And if anybody watching this happens to.
Be in l.a and needs any renovations done.
Hit up jonathan and racing green that.
Are the absolute best okay let's come on.
Down to this here.
And on to the basketball court if you.
Know me you know that i'm not really a.
Sporty person so you're probably.
Wondering.
Why the heck i have this in the house.
Although i will not be using this very.
Often i do have quite a lot of boys in.
My life.
Louis loves basketball a lot of my.
Friends husbands do as well.
Who knows maybe one day with a little.
Bit of practice i could be lebron james.
Charles.
I'm gonna stick with makeup now i.
Clearly am not a basketball star and.
That's fine.
Okay i know what i'm good at and i'm.
Gonna leave that part of the yard to.
Everybody else.
But this part of the yard is mine we.
Have this massive oak tree right here.
Which is.
So beautiful we have this fun little.
Hanging chair as well which is.
Such a vibe honestly i have been just.
Sitting out here reading and looking at.
My phone going over business emails so.
Often and then finally the best part of.
The entire house.
The in-ground trampoline now when i.
First moved in this entire area used to.
Be a putting green and no offense to any.
Golfers or anything it's just the only.
Thing that i would want.
My house but i have wanted an ingrown.
Trampoline in my home for so long now.
And it is finally a reality and oh my.
God we have literally been out here.
Non-stop jumping doing tricks being.
Flips double bouncing each other.
And also just sitting out here talking.
And trying to touch the leaves as well.
This is literally an olympic.
Braid trampoline and it is so.
Much fun.
Okay you guys i'm absolutely exhausted.
I'm out of breath.
And this has been a very very long day.
Of filming this house tour video.
But i really hope that you guys have.
Enjoyed seeing what we've built over the.
