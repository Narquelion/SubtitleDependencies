Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel.
Cutting right to the point for today's.
Video i wanted to sit down and just do.
Some type of glam look i feel like for.
The past several several videos i've.
Been wearing a super super light glam i.
Mean it has honestly been a week since i.
Put on eye shadow which is absolutely.
Horrifying considering my job is.
Literally a makeup artist i put together.
This winged out bronzy half cut crease i.
Look that i absolutely am in love with.
And then i added these gold little star.
Freckles which you will see later on in.
The video which is such a cute little.
Touch that i am so in love with and then.
I just paired it with this nude lip and.
This is the look that i came up with i'm.
Getting like very very summery festival.
Vibes.
I know summer is like basically over.
With and that means back-to-school.
Season is coming whoo check out last.
Week's video after needed tutorial on it.
But i figured i would do this little.
Festival kind of inspired look just to.
Bring us back to the good old days all.
That being said if you guys would like.
To see how i created this look make sure.
You keep on watching so to start off i.
Already went ahead and i primed my face.
Using my moisturizer and then i'm gonna.
Go in with my make up for ever ultra hd.
Stick in the shade of y 365 for a base.
It's actually been so long since i've.
Done a full coverage glam i feel like.
I've only been doing a light building.
Natural glam for a very long time now so.
I'm super excited to actually be doing a.
Real look today and this is gonna be a.
Super super fun one as well i'm also.
Gonna grab a little bit of too faced.
Spores and sohee foundation in the shade.
And natural beige and just put a little.
Bit on the back of my hand and i'm going.
To dip into my beauty blender and kind.
Of use this foundation to blend out the.
Make up front row ultra hd stick these.
Are both my favorite foundations for.
Very different reasons so i'm gonna get.
The best of both worlds today oh my god.
I can't believe actually never tried.
Mixing these two foundations together i.
Guess i've never really thought about it.
Because the makeup everyone is a stick.
And then the two based one is a liquid.
But my skin looks so good right now oh.
My god chicken seal today i'm gonna grab.
My atar shape tube concealer in the.
Shade lightmedium honey and just.
Highlight the high points of my face.
I don't know if it's all that studio.
Light that we added but i think if my.
Eyes are not deceiving me that we were.
Having a super super good skin day today.
Which makes me so happy thank you for.
Once in my life to lock our face in.
Place that are gonna be using of course.
The laura mercier translucent setting.
Powder during the summer time i really.
Like only setting up my nose area and.
Then under my eyes because those are the.
Two areas that definitely wear out the.
Fastest and get the most creases so i.
Really just like setting hair to lock.
The face but then as for the rest my.
Face.
I literally just add the lightest layer.
A powder possible if even powdering at.
All because i really like the summer and.
Dewy foundation look as you guys know i.
Feel like it just looks so beautiful and.
So natural and i am going to a party.
Slash event tonight that i'm literally.
So excited for it is the desi and katy.
Dose of colors launched i am so proud of.
Them and so skater to try the products.
But i definitely need this foundation.
And makeup look to last a very very long.
Time because it is early in the morning.
Today and i have to wear this at like 7.
P.m. tonight so definitely want to keep.
This in place.
I don't think want this look to be super.
Super golden and bronzy today so of.
Course we have to pack on the bronzer.
And for this i'm gonna use my benefit.
Hoola bronzer as always as i murphy m.
For a fire brush and you guys know you.
Can use code j's for 10% off all morphe.
Brushes since i didn't pack on the.
Setting powder today i'm being very very.
Light when i'm applying this bronzer.
Because if i dig it into my face too.
Hard it's definitely gonna lead the.
Powder looking super super patchy and i.
Definitely want it to cling on to the.
Still kind of wet foundation so i'm just.
Being super super light and letting that.
Color get on there naturally.
Alright so listen to you guys i.
Literally just did exactly what i said.
Not to do and i was bronzing to hard.
Enough you can see right here on camera.
My foundation is coming up a little bit.
And starting to separate so i'm just.
Gonna lightly go over that with some.
More studying powder just make sure that.
Area is really really locked in place.
Because i don't my foundation to wear oh.
Next thing to grab my kat von d shade in.
Late huh and my anasazi a 22 brush and.
We dip into this light yellow shade.
Right up in here i just used that a.
Little bit to reinforce the highlights.
On my face it's good to reinforce those.
Highlights that we originally put on.
With the concealer just because after.
Bronzer and contour that brightness can.
Sometimes get lost amongst the blending.
And everything so it's always good to.
Reinforce and make sure we are snatched.
And fully chiseled i'm going to grab my.
Luxy 180 nose contouring brush and dip.
Into it the middle shade and the left.
Shade of the shade of my palette and.
Then lightly.
My nose i'm gonna grab a little bit more.
Laura mercier powder and just lightly.
Baked besides my nose just to make sure.
It's really really locked in a place i.
Guess might as well go really full-time.
Bake the rest night phase to it has.
Definitely been a hot minute why not i.
Just went ahead and did my eyebrows.
Off-camera you guys to be doing them.
Literally a million times so i figured.
Might as well just skip out on it today.
As well i kind of want to cry right now.
Because i literally just hid my entire.
Eye on camera and explained everything.
Only just realized i wasn't actually.
Recording so normally my videos don't go.
In this order normally i do one on.
Camera then off i guess what is already.
Done so now we're gonna do the other one.
On camera again but this time we better.
Be recording i'm gonna start off with my.
Um 4-3-3 brush and dipping into the.
Joseline help palette i'm gonna grab.
This kind of mac and cheese type shade.
And it's gonna put that all up in the.
Crease i'm literally so annoyed right.
Now because doing eye looks on camera.
And having to explain everything.
Literally takes me forever but i can.
Literally recreate the same eye look off.
Camera and like ten minutes no matter.
What i look it is so i know i'm gonna be.
Late to my event now and this is not.
What i wanted to happen i'm not swearing.
Another m 4 3 3 brush and i'm gonna dip.
Into this orange shade right up in here.
And put that in the crease once again to.
Deepen it up when i get to this outer.
Corner i'm going to wing out the shadow.
Quite a bit because we want that like.
Blended out festival type makeup look.
Next i'm going to dip into this warm tom.
Brown shape it up in here and start to.
Deepen out the outer corner and blend.
That up a little bit into the crease.
Then with my m56 - i'm just gonna blend.
Out those edges.
Using my m 509 brush i'm just gonna grab.
The slightest bit of the black shape on.
The bottom corner and just eeping out.
The very very very outer v i'm gonna be.
Super super careful with this color.
Because adding too much block can really.
Ruin this look very very very quickly.
And this black in this palette is super.
Super pigmented as well so i'm just.
Going to add a light amount and then.
Blend it out like i said i'm being super.
Super careful and letting this out i.
Definitely am not going for a block.
Smokey eye look today maybe that's next.
Video but for now i just want to deepen.
Up that outer corner so adding block is.
Really really risky but can definitely.
Look great if you do it right i'm gonna.
Add some little on top of the lid but at.
The base i'm gonna go to the my morphe.
35o palette and my makeup shock t6 brush.
And i'm gonna dip into this orange shade.
In the bottom right corner and just use.
This to carve out the crease.
Oh the shadow is literally so pretty oh.
My god one slash taught us on there i'm.
Just gonna grab a clean a blending brush.
And go right over those edges to make.
Sure everything is really really.
Diffused and blended out except for the.
Crease obviously but that's kind of the.
Whole point to add a little bit of.
Glitter and more pop to this eye look.
I'm gonna grab these steal at liquid.
Glitters stuff and rose gold retro you.
Guys know these are so bomb i'm gonna.
Lightly pat this over top of that shadow.
Oh yeah wow that is over looking for.
That looks so pretty for the lower lash.
That i'm gonna go in with my m 4-3-3 and.
Dip into that burnt orange shade at once.
Again and just put a little bit of it.
Down right after i destroy this glitter.
Fallout oh my i'm definitely gonna hug.
The shadow very very close to the lash.
Line when i get to this outer corner i'm.
Also gonna blend it up into this dark.
Out our wing portion it being a very.
Very careful to not really take it on.
Into this area just think i kind of just.
Did because that's when things start.
Getting really really muddy like right.
Here but no worries we're gonna fix it.
Next intagram i am 509 brush and dip.
Into the soft brown shade right here and.
Define at the very very upper lash line.
Lower lash line then if i am 149 and a.
Little bit of burnt orange and just come.
Up on that out because once again we.
Definitely don't want a black smoky eye.
One check that i love to do is driving.
My beauty blender and a little bit more.
Of that translucent powder that i use it.
Doesn't matter which one and i'm just.
Going to put a little bit of powder.
Right underneath that shadow to kind of.
Bake it and lighten it back up to skin.
Tone and this will actually really do a.
Good job of cleaning everything up and.
Then finally i'm gonna grab my nyx.
Wonder pencil in the lightest shade and.
Use this to a line at my waterline.
Census look at super super intense and.
Dark on those outer corners i definitely.
Wanna use a lighter color in the.
Waterline to open my eyes back up we're.
All still gonna look super super small.
And tiny for mascara today i'm gonna do.
A light coat of benefit roller lash two.
Bears no this is my all-time favorite.
Lashes so got a pop of my house lashes.
Iconic light it has been so long since.
I've used these lashes and i'm honestly.
So excited i'm getting like so much.
Nostalgia i think everything using lily.
Lashes miami's for the past like sixty.
Four years straight so it's time for a.
Little bit of a sweat job.
For that classic golden glow of course.
You guys know we're gonna be using the.
Anasazi oh sell hollywood illuminator i.
Use this all the time like literally in.
Every single video but it truly is so.
Good and it works really perfectly for.
My skin tone as well i find that.
Oftentimes a lot of highlighters can.
Leave a gray cast on my skin because i.
Do have a pretty light skin or it'll.
Just look really walking in general so.
Definitely would recommend it so.
Hollywood of course gonna put this on my.
Brow bone as well you guys know the.
Drill by now i'm also gonna highlight my.
3 one brush all.
Right so that is the glow all complete.
And before we actually move on to the.
Lips.
I do introducing a little bit fun for.
This look if you guys follow me on.
Snapchat you know that this whole are.
You doing my setup process has been.
Quite the process yes a few weeks ago.
Mr. kay came over and actually helped me.
Rearrange its entire beauty room and now.
I've actually rearranged again but.
Regardless they've always been one of my.
Favorite channels i love their videos so.
Freakin much and they have been a major.
Source of inspiration for all my.
Apartment decorating stuff and when.
Caine was over she did give me her.
Little mr. kay a beauty mark stickers.
And i didn't test these out earlier on.
But i'm gonna be putting these like.
Little gold stars up in here on my halle.
Area because why not.
I'm just gonna take my little pair of.
Eyelash tweezers and i'm going to cut.
Out my stars i just remove the plastic.
Throw from the top as well and then i'm.
Just going to place it on my skin where.
I want it and i think we're gonna put.
This right over here on my highlight.
Region and then i'm just gonna hold it.
In place and i have a damp towel here.
And i'm just going to press this right.
Into the skin i tested this out earlier.
As well before i actually did this whole.
Look to make sure that this one mess up.
My entire face the foundation and it did.
Not it looked super super great so i am.
Not worried i am just being really.
Really careful because obviously we.
Don't want our entire face to get wet.
Just the part that has the little.
Sticker on it as we learned in my video.
From a few weeks ago most makeup is.
Definitely waterproof this is literally.
Exactly like all the temporary tattoos.
That we all did we were like 8 years old.
But just a whole lot prettier.
Alright and once it's been on for 30.
Seconds i'm just going to give it a good.
Little pat and then oh yes i love all.
These gold records without they're loose.
