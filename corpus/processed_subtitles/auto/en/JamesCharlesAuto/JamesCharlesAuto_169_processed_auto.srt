Absolute most and also a few days ago i.
Broke the nail which was so great but my.

Decided to not do a nude but instead we.
Went with these pink drink nails which.

An actual oh oh my god just like an.
Actual pink drink from starbucks i think.
They turned out so so cute i do want to.
Give up proper credit to my friend.
Leslie and her no time crazy calderon.
For inspiring these nails that did at.
First and i just wanted to recreate them.
And that keeps my don't talk queenie for.
Doing them anyway clearly at this point.
Everyone knows that the obsession with.
Me and pink drinks has gone very very.
Far and somehow after being on youtube.
And doing makeup for almost four years i.
Have never actually done a pink drink.
Makeup look so if i could say would be.
The perfect time to do so to just sit.
Down and play with makeup also while i.
Was thinking of ways that i could do it.
This pink drink makeup look i remembered.
That what my favorite accounts of all.
Time shine shadows so check them out.
Actually did a pink drink makeup look on.

Smart little puppy a lot of my close.
Friends and family have came over to him.

And he is my mom the absolute best.
Behavior with everybody i just like.
Don't know how we lucked out so much but.
He is probably like one of the most calm.
But most fun but most of all behaved.
Dogs i've ever seen in my entire life.

I'm hello i'm just going to get my face.
Music.
Whoa hey quick spreads of the war be up.
In seconds having spray that's my.
All-time favorite setting spray use.
Cocaine with the firt time for soccer.
Practice it's been a while since i've.
Actually gotten a chance to say that and.
Now we're gonna move into up contouring.
And for that i'm actually gonna grab at.
The brand new dragon at beauty face.
Palette this is nikita's face which i.
Think is so cool i ops it web cess of.
This packaging and this is a brand new.
Product coming out and i want to support.
My sister so i'm just going to a contour.
In and do some blush and highlight using.
This palette i think it is very very.
Beautiful i'm gonna grab my morphe m 405.
And dip into the shade femme and let's.
Test this out so there's two other.
Colors in here for contouring we have a.
Femine also is heard we love a good cert.
So that is the soft contour color and.
Serge is for really deepening out some.
Of those areas looks really pretty on my.
Skin tone okay love this so far no.
Chisel out the chin of course the shade.
Femoris working out really really nicely.
And i honestly like how this color looks.
On my skintone quite a lot i'm gonna go.
To my better go to mo i'm gonna go up.
Into a but one two five zero brush from.
Morphe which is a little bit of a bigger.
Fluffy brush and dip into the shade of.
Serge this one looks like it is a very.
Very pivot that i'm gonna be very.
Careful about this but i'm gonna use its.
Color to do you bit up the cheekbone.
Okay that is very very parented i'm.
Gonna bomb that out in a second i like.
How that's close deeper but still has.
The neutral undertone so it doesn't look.
Absolutely crazy.
I do however think this is a little bit.
Dark for my skin tone this is looking a.
Little bit intense so i'm not going to.
Choose any more of that but i think for.
A medium to tan skin tones that color is.
Going to be absolutely perfect oh we.
Thought so looks good isaiah chiseled.
Contour if i ever did see one i'm gonna.
Grab my nose a contouring brush and grab.
A little bit of a femme again and we're.
Going to snatch this sister schnoz that.
Sentence was ridiculously annoying sorry.
About that color looks really good on my.
Nose contour oh my god okay that looks.
Really really dope i'm really excited.
About this now for blush of enduring by.
Ea4 brush and debated the shade bb a.
Girl which is the more pinky rose tone.
Color in the palette normally i would go.
With tea girl and i'm very very excited.
To try this but census as a more a pink.
Team to makeup look today i figure this.
One the match a lot better and there's.
Gonna pop this on my cheeks that's a.
Really pretty blush color why don't i.
Just like that's a really pretty that's.
A really pretty blush color no another.
Quick spritz of mya.
Satya spray and i was gonna pop out a.
Little bit of a highlight so i'm gonna.
Grab these shade fantasy which is this.
Thick reflective a pink shade in a.
Little bit of a silicone as well nikita.
You are absolutely crazy and just add a.
Little bit of this on the cheekbone oh.
Wow that is really really pretty i like.
That it's a little bit more of a subtle.
Glow you can definitely layer it up but.
Also it's like really pretty but has a.
Little bit of a larger particle size so.
It's more glittery than just like a.
Normal glow from within type of.
Highlighter that is really beautiful i.
Promise that this video was not.
Sponsored by an aikido dragon or a.
Dragon video but i won't be texting.
After this and sending her an invoice so.
Now that that is all autumn's better.
Grab a little bit of my setting powder.
On my saying about blending it sponge.
And just bait decides when those and.
Under up my eyes just to bring back some.
Of that brightness and now i'm just.
Gonna quickly go do my brows off-camera.
At same exact way as always use my.
Anasazi up brow products bad my roots.
Have grown in a thank god at the lodge a.
Little better to who my hair although.
This is looking a little bit of a mess.
And is about ready for a change as well.
So i'll be right back you guys is acid.
Acidic oh wow.
That's worse than my farts you have to.
Admit that as worse than my farts and.
Not a lot of things are worse than my.
Farts alright you guys we are back in.
Both eyebrows are now complete they are.
Not looking in the past i literally do.
My eyebrows for 45 minutes straight.
Because i could not get them even it is.
One of those days but you know what.
We're gonna hopefully redeem ourselves.
With the eye shadow portion so for this.
Look tonight we're using it two.
Different palettes of course the james.
House next morphe palette but also the.
Anasazi beverly hills nor vina volume at.
Three palette that just came out these.
Colors are so beyond study and i feel.
Like this screen of this great and this.
Pink will be really really good for.
Creating at these starbucks pinky.
Chickadee colors alright you guys so to.
Start off we're gonna grab a tiny little.
Angle brush and dip into the shade of.
Course pinky drink kitty and at the.
James house.
Power i'm gonna give that a little bit.
Of a spritz of the prepping settings.
Right just so it is a little bit more.
Sticky and i'm gonna start sketching out.
My winged liner that is looking nice and.
Sharp amazing obviously you're gonna.
Clean that up with concealer in a second.
Anyway with whatever's excess on my.
Brush is going to use this concealer to.
Cut that wing and then with a tiny.
Little liner brush i'm going to go in.
And start sketching out the little.
Triplets going on those are so cute i.
Love the little pink drinks flying liner.
Normally for a colored liner like this i.
Would normally use a liquid lipstick but.
I could not find a color like a pink a.
Teaching kitty and my actual collection.
Despite the fact that it's like a light.
Pink all my nudes are more peachy tones.
So the shadow will work just as well i.
Know this looks ridiculous right now but.
Give it a few seconds it's gonna come.
Together i'm now gonna grab a tiny.
Little a liner brush and dip into the.
Shade a little bit of a daddy from my.
Palette and a little bit of a one from.
The verbena palette pretty much makes.
Like the exact.
Starbucks a green i'm just gonna do the.
Same exact thing this person is a little.
Bit of prep and set i'm going to use.
This color to make a double wing now.
That is all laid out and i got my tom.
Florida black eyeliner and very very.
Very carefully outline the pink section.
There are a lot of areas that i still.
Tried to get better and make up every.
Single time that i do it but the.
Absolute one thing that i am so bad at.
That i wish i was better at is wholly an.
Eyeliner study i cannot make an even.
Straight line for the life of me it is.
So beyond annoying okay that looks.
Honestly good great okay now let's do a.
Line in between the pink and the green.
So close okay let's try and cover that.
Up in the meantime let me add some.
Little white highlights.
Music.
Okay that looks kind of good let's go.
Ahead and move on to the lower lash line.
I'm gonna grab those same a little bit.
Of a pink shadows on my little liner.
Brush and put them in my waterline and.
In this run he actually added a really.
Long pink drip underneath the eye which.
I think is super super cool so i'm going.
To go ahead and do that as well and the.
Lower quarter this i hear he has like.
This red part which i believe is like.
The strawberry guts for lack of a better.
Term because they have the freeze dried.
Strawberries in the actual drink so i'm.
Going to grab a red liquid lipstick and.
Try to do that eyes wow i'm gonna add a.
Little bit of a reddit shadowing on the.
Drip just like in the original photo.
Maybe another little dollop of white.
Just for highlights.
I feel like this little dollop should.
Have an outline it doesn't in the.
Original photo but i'm gonna add this.
Little red inner corner light or thing.
That we have going on because that is.
There's no photo and it looks super chic.
And now it's a little bit of a green and.
The lower lash line this is strawberry a.
Little bit of you're kidding from the.
Palette yep that's what okay now that.
Actually you can make a strawberry on my.
Eyebrow this i am concerned about i am.
Going to rob do you read at first this.
The top of the strawberry is usually.
Pretty flat so let's go ahead and do.
That now we can go ahead and safely it.
Fill this in completely with red should.
It be bigger than this yeah yeah oh let.
Me set that in place using you're.
Kidding from my palette and a little bit.
Of c2 from the verbena pellet having a.
Little bit of a boutique from my palette.
I'm going to add a little bit of like a.
Darker area of the strawberry over here.
Leaving the side highlighted and.
I'm going to grab my liner brush which.
Is right here and add some white and i'm.
Gonna add in the seeds back so it should.
Actually be a pure white blob at first.
Now what the red once again let's add.
Some seeds back in there let's go ahead.
And add these stem of the strawberry now.
A darker green for some shadow using it.
Daddy from the pallet to shade this in.
Wow that's so much harder to do that i.
Thought it was gonna be oh my gosh that.
Looks okay.
It looks okay but it's time to move on.
First or now it's time for the other eye.
And this eye is going to be the actual.
Pink train okay let's all in the drink.
First there we go okay that's actually.
That's a good shape.
Great great great great let's talk about.
Tick-tock oh my gosh if any you guys.
Watching this video have a tick-tock.
Which i'm sure you do first of all.
Follow me lady's name isn't james.
Charles and i am not afraid to admit.
That i am officially obsessed the tech.
Talk it is so much fun it is not even.
Funny do you guys want me to actually.
Start making tic tocs please let me know.
I literally posted one that was just.
Like a posing video i wanted to do i.
Literally started filming a pink drink.
Like transformation tech talk at the.
Beginning of this video and then got.
Distracted and forgot so that's really.
Really great but let me know if you guys.
Want to see me actually do tic tocs.
Because it's kind of fun it's kind of.
Rushed i mean all my should be a tick.
Tock clean okay that shape looks great.
Driving ajh of 41 russians gonna grab.
Some a pink adia drink adia from the.
Palette and set that in place now let's.
Add some little strawberry bits in there.
Okay so then for these shell guys are.
Gonna top some of them in and cover them.
With a little bit of shadow as well.
That way we'll add some and dimension in.
And it'll look like some of the shaw.
Berries or like right up against the.
Edge of the cup but some are like.
Actually floating kind of in the middle.
Of the drink and those would therefore.
Be like a little bit more cloudy and.
Then the ones that the edge would look.
Like bright red if that makes sense and.
Then whatever's left on that brush was.
Gonna add in some with nice little like.
Patches of darker red all around the.
Drink just for somebody's added.
Dimension just so doesn't look like.
One color like that looks really really.
Good now taking that drink once again.
I'm gonna add in something could you.
Drink it right over top of this so it.
Looks like the shower buddies are cloudy.
Just like i said that looks really.
Really good okay now with that same.
Technique i'm gonna add a little bit of.
White splotches in the top of the drink.
To kind of look like ice cubes but also.
The foam that comes to the top when you.
First order i think i need a few more.
Little red splotches in here is taking a.
Long time i'm gonna take that flat brush.
From before that i use to fill in the.
Pink kitty drink a tea cup and just.
Clean it off with a little bit of a.
Makeup wipe and i'm going to dip fully.
Into the white so i'm gonna add on a.
Rectangle for the top that'll be the lid.
Now i'm gonna grab a tiny little brush.
And some flash back and set that way in.
Place that looks so good wow okay it's.
Turning out great okay now i want to add.
The little bit of like shadows that.
Basically are like the dividers in the.
Cup so what i need to do first is a.
Taste like paint drink okay so i'm gonna.
Add a shadow below also gonna add a.
Slight outline to the entire drink now.
I'm gonna add my two little dividend.
Lines in the bottom i'm actually gonna.
Go to the shade is c 4 and a little bit.
Of b 3 from the marina pellet to those.
Because it'll be like a deeper pink.
Which i think will be good instead of.
Like a brown yeah yeah oh my god yes and.
Then one more time for here just buffing.
That out using a little bit of a pink.
Add a trinket ian let me are gonna miss.
Starbucks this is where i'm actually.
Worried the circle hostel like and here.
Well i don't really know how i'm gonna.
Do this with my eyelid fold there well.
The original look was cleared on.
Somebody's arm where an eyelid fold is.
Not an issue but this is definitely a.
Problem yeah i guess i could just do the.
Green circle instead of doing the entire.
Starbucks logo this is falling apart.
Rather quickly.
Let's leave a little bit out i'm gonna.
Add the three little lines that are like.
D little measuring lines on the side of.
The cuff so we're gonna do that we're.
Here that they're gonna be like in my.
Actual pupils we're not gonna include.
That one okay so i'm gonna add a straw.
To this cup just to it match the.
Original and so the drink is more.
Recognizable as an actual drink but.
Y'all know i did not use a plastic.
Straws my local starbucks actually has.
These reusable lids which is a super.
Super awesome save the turtles and i.
Hope you guys are so close to being done.
Okay now i'm just gonna add it some.
Green and liner to match the.
Left-hand-side end with that same red.
Color for that little rat point just a.
Little bit of green on the lash line i.
Am obsessed with all this look is.
Looking so far i will say and but this.
Took way way longer than anticipated oh.
My god those are the eyes all complete i.
Decided it was best to not actually.
Include the starbucks logo i normally.
Would be down for the challenge of.
Drawing it but because of the eyelid.
Fold it it's really just not going to.
Work her head will be flopping all.
Around in there and it's just not gonna.
Be good i'm gonna leave it the way it is.
I might even photoshop about the dancer.
And picture who knows regardless i'm.
Gonna behad on some mascara oh my god.
Forgot the word i'm gonna grab the a.
Brand new lily lashes ox ox ox mascara.
It is really really bobby guys oh my.
Good you know what i also want to talk.
About with you guys okay mario kart tour.
For the iphone oh my god after literally.
In 3 million years of waiting nintendo.
Finally released mario kart for iphone.
And i've never been more excited for.
Anything literally in my entire life i.
Have an absolute mario kart scene it was.
My all-time favorite game as a kid this.
Is before my minecraft era.
We go home from school every single day.
And stand on my base and play at mario.
Kart wii and i was so good at it i don't.
Know if it's embarrassing or impressive.
To a bit but i literally used to hold a.
Few different world records in the game.
I can't believe two submitted that on.
Camera when it comes to makeup i would.
Definitely say like i'm pretty good at.
It i mean it is my job i do all the time.
I come up with some pretty beautiful.
Looks but there's so many artists that i.
Genuinely think are like a million miles.
Ahead of me and that's awesome because.
It gives me room to always grow and.
Practice more and more but mario kart on.
The other hand i can't even be humble.
About it you guys mario kart i'm so good.
Like i'm i'm truly a queen of mario kart.
And i've been waiting four years now for.
Them to finally bring it up for the.
Iphone and it is here i downloaded a few.
Minutes ago for pre-order and last night.
It finally became available and i've.
Been playing it non-stop and i have.
Quite a lot of thoughts okay on a.
Positive note the graphics and.
Performance of the actual app absolutely.
Stunning it looks so it i've honestly.
Never even seen an iphone game with like.
That level of quality it looks visually.
Phenomenal the controls on the other.
Hand they just make no sense when i was.
First playing it orion's we have that.
Meme of the kardashians episode when.
Khloe is driving the car around and then.
It cuts to the clip of the van just.
Floating around in the sky.
Because that's what i literally felt.
Like what's going on with my cart no.
Matter which way i turn toward my.
Fingers i would go the complete wrong.
Way so steering is definitely a little.
Bit of a challenge and i hope that they.
Kind of improve the controls as an avid.
Fan i'm definitely a little bit.
Disappointed but i'm definitely looking.
Forward to hearing what you guys have to.
Say about it i am a very very punk for.
Them to open up multiplayer mode in a.
Few days from now when it doesn't up.
Releasing i will probably post my friend.
Call on my twitter so you guys can all.
Add me and then i can it whoop all of.
Your asses in the game and regards of.
Whatever i think about it i'm still.
Clearly addictively playing it and so is.
Literally the entire world now so let me.
Know what your guys thoughts are and.
Down below and let's get ready to race.
Alright you guys now that that is all.
I'm gonna get my face a nice spritz of.
Some wrapping stuff settings right just.
To kind of melt everything i'm back into.
Place because it has been done literally.
Like three or four hours since i put on.
My base routine and she's looking a.
Little bit crusty i'm gonna dip it back.
Into the dragon a beauty of palette and.
Got me a smaller brush and we're just.
Gonna add our second layer of.
Highlighter onto the other side in the.
Original photo by shine and shadows he.
Did give me a little bit of freckles so.
I am gonna put some nice pink and orange.
Blush on my nose and add those and just.
Because they're very very cute and.
Youthful and then i was gonna add it a.
Few freckles like a normal head last but.
Finally and not least to finish off this.
Makeup look i'm just gonna grab a nude.
Lip liner has a lace and then i was.
Gonna finish it off with a little bit of.
A gloss it's nice and juicy already you.
Go use this several hours and several.
Pink kitty drink it is later this is.
Number three just like the mario kart.
