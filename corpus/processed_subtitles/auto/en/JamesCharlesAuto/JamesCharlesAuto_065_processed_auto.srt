Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to toy-u channel.
Usually for my videos i felt my intro.
First and then film the actual video.
Content but for today's video.
I'm doing something a little bit.
Different my editor i just finished the.
Final edit version of today's video that.
You guys are about to watch and i really.
Just wanted to cut out the intro that we.
Already felt and hop on camera now.
Instead and give you guys a little.
Preface to today's video and say that.
This is literally one of my favorite.
Videos that i have ever filmed i am so.
Proud of how this turned out what i know.
That you guys are absolutely going to.
Love it i have been trying to film a.
Video like this for over two years now.
And it's never been possible up until.
Today now if you are a true sister you'd.
Know that aside from doing makeup of.
Course my favorite pastime in the entire.
World is doing escape rooms in case.
You've never done it at skate even.
Before or don't even know what it is.
First of all i'm so sorry for you but.
Second of all escape rooms are immersive.
Interactive puzzle rooms where you're.
Basically locked into space for 60.
Minutes with your family co-workers.
Friends or sometimes even strangers and.
You have to work together to solve.
Puzzles riddles find clues open locks.
And the goal is of course to escape now.
I personally love escape rooms for a few.
Different reasons mostly because i.
Really really thrive and enjoy high.
Pressure and high-stress situations i.
Absolutely love puzzle and riddle.
Solving and also you get to put your.
Phone away for an hour and just focus on.
Something other than like those social.
Media road which i definitely get caught.
Up in up quite a lot and they just make.
Me very very happy most rooms start with.
60 minutes on the clock which may seem.
Like a really long time but when you're.
In there time absolutely flies but as.
I've done at more and more rooms my.
Times have gotten faster and faster and.
Faster and for today's video i want to.
Challenge myself and combine my two.
Biggest passions and i'm gonna see if i.
Can do my full face of makeup while.
Beating an escape room.
Music.
All right sisters we are here at a 60.
Out escape rooms in los angeles and this.
Is literally my favorite place to go for.
Escape rooms because they have so many.
Different locations and i've actually.
Almost finished every single one of the.
Rooms so i'm so grateful and excited.
That we got to put this video together.
In time before i finished literally all.
Of them i have not seen the room yet.
Because i want this to be a surprise i.
Wanna be able to solve it just like.
Normal but my videographer luis who's.
Behind the camera right now already went.
Through the room up with the 60 out team.
And placed my makeup products like in.
The right order so as i go through and i.
Complete the room i'll be getting my.
Products like one by one so do my full.
Face of makeup and a full escape room in.
Under an hour not really sure how this.
Is gonna go but regardless it's going to.
Be so much fun and i'm so excited to.
