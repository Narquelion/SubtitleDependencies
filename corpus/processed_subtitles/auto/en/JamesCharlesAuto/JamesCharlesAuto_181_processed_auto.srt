The case i missed any and i picked out.
Three to do for today's video that i.
Think are gonna be so much fun and i'm.
So excited for this first one because i.
Picked up this iconic look by makeup by.
Raquel oh my god look at how pretty this.
Is it is just a warm toned brown smokey.
Eye but she added this beautiful pop of.
Yellow in the inner corner brickhouse.
One way all-time favorite artist to.
Follow right now she is literally 16.
Years old and she's been doing so many.
Incredible looks using the palette like.
Oh my god that blending work is insane i.
Invited her to my launch party and she.
Was just so incredibly sweet and is so.
Talented she reminds me a lot of myself.
From a few years ago and i think she's.
Gonna go very very far in this industry.
So please go check her out and show your.
Social support and love as always i.
Figured this look would be perfect to do.
First and today is a brand video because.
So many people have been requesting a.
Glam look from me which i totally get.
Obviously i've been focusing a lot on.
The rainbow colors because that's kind.
Of the point of the palette but i did.
Put in a ton of beautiful neutral and.
Warm tone shades and there as well.
Perfect for everybody who doesn't feel.
As comfortable wearing those crazy.
Colors on their eyelids and just want.
Something a little bit more wearable on.
An everyday basis.
This look is gonna be perfect because it.
Is a typical glam look but it still adds.
A little bit of a pop of color for those.
You who just want to dip your toes in.
But don't feel comfortable going all the.
Way i'm gonna start off my drop of miami.
Won 7-3 brush and dipping it to my back.
Paint pot in the shade of painterly.
And using this to a prime my eyelids so.
Opening up the palette we're gonna be.
Mainly focusing on at the middle row of.
Bigger pans right here obviously we are.
Gonna add a pop of color later on but i.
Firmly did all these shades perfect for.
Creating any warm tone smokey eye and.
That is exactly what we were doing today.
I'm gonna first so if i can get a matte.
Four or five six brush and dipping into.
The shade and no beans and this is the.
Warm tone of brown in the palette and.
I'm just gonna pop the shade right onto.
My eyelid i'm nicer than have another m4.
Fine.
Ruslan dip into a 10% off and i'm just.
Gonna place this shade right above that.
No beans color and just blend it lightly.
Upwards just kind of chopping that shade.
On there first and then using light.
Little circular motions just to blend.
Out that brown edge moving right up the.
Line i'm resting up in a mat 4-3-3 brush.
And dip into the shader code james a.
Right next door and same exact thing i'm.
Gonna use this color to go right over.
That edge and start blending a little.
Bit more upwards just using light.
Circular motions and then finally with.
An eye before for one i'm gonna dip into.
The shade of two and they're just a.
Little bit of family as well and use.
This to blend out that final edge will.
Be gone to the lower lash then i'm gonna.
Take the same i'm four five six brush.
And the shade and no beads and just tuck.
This right up in there bringing it all.
The way across the lower lash line and.
Also making sure to connect it up with.
That outer v on the upper lash line as.
Well.
I cannot stand in smoky eyes when the.
Lower and upper lash line are not.
Connected i think it looks really really.
Messy so just put that collar there plug.
In the same exact color order next.
Undergrad about ten percent off and.
Blend that edge out and blend this right.
Below no beans and then coat james and.
Then finally five honey in tune to.
Highlight the brow bone are gonna grab a.
Little bit of a face on just a flat top.
Little brush and give it a quick spritz.
Of the oven set setting spray and just.
Pop that right up in there i'm gonna.
Grab my tiny bit of five money on just.
That same and four for one brush and go.
Over that because that was a little much.
So that is the brown smokey i literally.
Already complete using the entire.
Mineral of the palette like i said you.
Guys i picked these colors for a reason.
It is so easy to create the most.
Beautiful.
Chocolatey warm tone i look ever i'm.
Obsessed with how this turned out now.
You could totally stop here but i do.
Want to add it just a little bit of a.
Pop of color you guys it is so much fun.
To do so i'm trying to decide that.
Because in raquel's original photo she.
Had a pop of yellow in the inner corner.
Which was so beyond a stunning like i.
Was obsessed with it but sister kylie.
Recently posted a picture where she had.
A pop of a pink in the inner corner and.
It was so beyond sunny.
I feel like inner corner colors is.
Becoming a major ten right now so i.
Think just to switch things up a little.
Bit because i have been doing a lot of.
Yellow recently i want to do a pop of.
Pink so to do a pop of color.
For three one this is a little pencil.
Brush that comes in the brush set and.
Dip into the bright neon pink shade a.
Called skip no i do want to give you a.
Fair warning you guys if this pink shade.
Is insanely pigmented and if you have a.
Sensitive skin it may or may not cause.
Staining so be careful i'm just gonna.
Pop this shade right here i'm just.
Popping it right in that inner corner.
And then using any excess that's left on.
The brush to kind of lightly blend it.
Into the kind of transition shades that.
We had going on around the eye i'm not.
Going to a matte five six to in a tiny.
Little bit more of skip but really top.
Off the access and just use this to.
Crabb fluffily fluffily watch this is a.
Fluffy brush i'm scared just blend out.
The address gonna dip into a little bit.
Of pink kitty drink a tea to help me.
Blend this out as well next for that pop.
Of glow i'm gonna dip into the shade of.
Litter leaves in that same little pencil.
Brush i absolutely love this color that.
Is one of my favorites from the palette.
I'm gonna give this a good spread of the.
Morphe prepping setting spray and just.
Tap that right in the center just to.
Really make that shadow pop i'm just.
Gonna have a tiny little bit of a liquid.
At glitter and they tiny little pencil.
Brush and dot dot right over top and.
Lastly probably not least i'm going to.
Line my waterline using the makeup.
Forever aqua oxalic color pencil in the.
Shade pink.
You definitely could skip this step if.
You don't feel comfortable putting a.
Pink and your waterline i know some.
People may think that that would look.
Sickly you can definitely do a nude or a.
Block and said if you want a more smoky.
Look but for me personally i really.
Really like when the pop of color just.
Continues in if you like it really pulls.
The whole eye look together.
Alright that is officially one eye all.
Complete i'm gonna go ahead and do that.
One off camera quickly and i'll be right.
Back with the finished look i just.
Finished up the other bronze smokey eye.
And i decided the pink looks a very very.
Beautiful but not our of raquel's.
Original photo i do want to add a pop of.
Yellow in the inner corner just because.
The look was literally too pretty not to.
Recreate and also to show you guys that.
You can do this with literally any of.
The color i mean a purple would be so.
Sunny with this a blue a green like.
Literally anything would look so pretty.
With this so i was gonna do it the pop.
Of yellow.
To grab a little bit of pee on a pencil.
Brush same exact technique is the pink.
Just popping the shade right in there oh.
My god so pigmented like the pink center.
Was gonna grab a fluffy brush and just.
Have been to a little bit that same a.
Shade b and just suzi is to lightly buff.
Out the edges of that yellow and make.
Sure it's evenly diffused into both the.
Regular skin around the area and also.
Into the orange of the smoky eye just.
Like the other side kind of got me a.
Little bit of regulate on a tiny little.
Pencil brush and give it a quick spritz.
I'll sum up prep insect and use this to.
Highlight right on that inner corner.
Carving some more beach make sure that's.
Nice and blend it out then carving a.
Little bit of a liquid glitter obviously.
This one is it gold this time and.
Packing about right over top then i'm.
Gonna finish this yellow eye off with.
Just a yellow pencil liner this one is.
From nyx gonna pop on a quick color of.
Mascaras in the mac extended fight for.
Laughs today i'm gonna pop on the lily.
Lashes and the style oh they are not.
Miami's for once but they are very very.
Similar these ones are actually just.
Longer on the end so these are gonna be.
Perfect for an eye look like this where.
We really want to focus it on the inner.
Corner and you can still always use code.
James for 15% off so those are both.
Lines all complete i thought that was.
Gonna look crazy having two different.
Colors in the inner corner but kind of.
Like living for this little strawberry.
Banana lemonade but we have going on it.
Right now i'm gonna go ahead and brush.
Off any excess powder that we still on.
At the face so we can move on to the.
Highlight can give my face a quick.
Spritz of the prep and settings right so.
The highlighter has something to adhere.
To and to kind of melt some of the.
Excess powder into the skin that on an.
Am 501 i'm gonna dip into the shade of.
Face and just go right yeah a little bit.
Right above with the brow bone as always.
Jim and then with that second m-43 one.
From the brush set just a tiny little.
Dot on the tip of the nose and one lie.
Right down the center then finally my e4.
Brush i'm gonna dip into the shade it.
Literally the same color that i use on.
My little pink inner corner you guys all.
Have been loving the shader recently for.
Blending together my highlight and blush.
Like i said in the beginning of the.
Video lips are already on for obvious.
Reasons and you guys i think that is the.
First look inspired by a makeup by.
Raquel i'll complete.
Music.
I had that so much finally recreate this.
Look if i recount like it's kind of.
Rather too looks today like i said.
Before had such an easy go to warm tones.
Folky out using the middle row of the.
Palette this is exactly when i created.
It and of course we got to do a little.
Puff of color as well just if it would.
Be whole unleash your inner artist theme.
I think this is the perfect look for any.
Beginner makeup wear who wants to just.
Dip their toes into color but it's a.
Comfortable going all the way yet but.
Speaking of going all the way we have.
Two more looks to do so that further ado.
Let's jump on to luck number two alright.
It is day number three i filming this.
Video but this is going to be look.
Number two i just wanted to say that.
Because of my hair it just got cut but.
In the next that was going to go back to.
Long and really really gross this has.
Been a vest filming but we're gonna get.
It done together.
You and i so let's move on to the lock.
So for the first think we definitely.
Kept it pretty simple glam still adding.
A pop of color but a really really great.
Look for the everyday it girl on the go.
But for look number two obviously that.
Says the artistry palette and it is a.
Full rainbow palette so for this look.
You guys know how to throw in something.
There with a whole lot of color so i.
Found this look by lauren bettles it is.
This beautiful like rainbow cloud cut.
Crease with lots of glitter different.
Stars and i'm obsessed with how this.
Turned out oh my god i think it is so.
Pretty you guys know i don't get to play.
With glitter that often on this youtube.
Channel because i really really don't.
Like it but i feel like she used this.
Very very wisely in this stuff but i.
Also have a few other ideas up my sleeve.
But i think i want to add to this look.
To really tie it together as well so.
Without further ado let's jump in.
So first let us rather than the inner.
Corner in that little crease moment and.
Obviously we're gonna cut out the cloud.
Later on but i'm first gonna cover to.
M45 sex and dip into the shade cola.
Which is the deep matte blue of the.
Palette and i'm just gonna pack col up.
Right inside of that like inner crease.
Area and i'm gonna bring it out a little.
Bit farther to what i do cut crease is i.
Usually actually cut out right on the.
Crease line because i have this really.
Annoying flap of skin that like covers.
My inner corner and seems like such a.
Stupid thing but you have no idea how.
Difficult it makes so many makeup looks.
Especially creases but with this cloud i.
Do want to kind of bring that in a.
Little.
More so i'm going to take that into.
Consideration next article all i'm gonna.
Take a little bit of a daddy on the same.
Exact brush and place the shade as well.
Right next to it on the crease in the.
Crease why don't i just next to daddy.
I'm gonna take it beyond an m4 33 brush.
And places right there padding on the.
Color first and then blending it upwards.
I'm gonna grab a little bit of you're.
Kidding on an m 4 5 6 brush as well and.
Put that in here i'm gonna add it.
Obviously in a lot more clutter that's.
Multiple of these all together but i.
Just want to kind of get the situation.
Started just like good amount of.
Everything out.
I'm gonna grab escape i don't employ 5 6.
Brush and put this over here at least.
And i need to go back into like all the.
Transitional colors to blend all this.
Together so it doesn't look disgusting.
Like this so what i'm going to do is.
Grab a fluffy brush and dip into it.
Single and i'm gonna use this and go.
Right over the edge of this red and.
Purple to diffuse these two colors.
Together and to blend out this outer.
Edge adding in some more of your kidding.
A little bit more of b gonna buff out.
That daddy using a bit of social blade.
And then finally a little bit of.
Playground just to buff out that inner.
Corner to cut the crease and create this.
Little cloud shape i'm gonna grab the.
Morphe white concealer and i'm going to.
Put this on the back of my hand okay so.
I'm gonna grab it the 19 brush this one.
Is not in my brush set when i was making.
The brush size and not exactly.
Anticipated doing a cloud cut crease so.
Sorry about that but i make this work.
Lump number one pretty good love if i do.
Say so myself i'm not gonna lie cut it.
Down kind of good kind of fresh kind of.
Funky kind of clouded london were three.
One more little lump okay this is good.
Okay so now i'm gonna grab the n 1 2 4.
This is my all-time favorite brush.
You're packing on shades and i'm first.
Gonna grab a little bit of love that i'm.
Gonna pack this right over top of that.
Like outer edge i'm gonna grab your.
Kidding on a tiny little pencil brush.
Some basically gonna like keep laying on.
These colors in the same rainbow we're.
Going back into the eyelid but i'm gonna.
Leave more and more white space.
Basically this is like rainbow liner.
Almost next to the red i want to place a.
Little bit of or so i'm gonna grab a.
Little bit of rustad put this like right.
There just coming actually gonna do five.
One eight finally gonna grab a little.
Bit of a yellow on that same brush i'm.
Gonna pack that right here nothing to.
Pack on some white put a little bit of.
Flash back right on top of everything.
Well i've been silent for almost this.
Entire video telling you know i'm.
Struggling for a real long okay i'm.
Gonna do the lower lash line now.
Something easy and nice so i need to.
First put on some more single with at.
Home for my sex and really bring this.
All the way into the lash we're gonna.
Kind of pull this down pretty far too.
Because i am gonna be awning glitter and.
Then just taking a little bit of.
Playground on this same brush from.
Before as well and tucking this right.
Next door and i'm gonna bring this right.
Open to the inner corner as well i'm.
Just lightly feathering out those edges.
Now i'm going to take a little bit of.
Black very carefully on a tiny little.
Pocket brush i'm gonna put this right up.
Against that lower lash line nice and.
Smoked for a real one okay that is.
Looking really beautiful so you guys.
Remember in the first look a few minutes.
Ago i talked about how i always like my.
Inner corner highlight and my waterline.
To always notch could i feel like it.
Makes the whole look up he said so i.
Wanna do the same thing here i'm gonna.
Have a huge pop of white in the inner.
Corner so i'm gonna grab a little bit of.
That morphe white concealer on a just.
Liner brush i'm gonna top it off so it.
Kind of dries down a little bit but i'm.
Gonna tuck this i'm gonna take a little.
Bit of a concealer as well just to.
Sketch in a new lower lash line in the.
Inner corner.
Just gonna grab a little bit of flash.
Buckle on a pencil brush and i'm going.
To pop this right on the inner corner.
Just to blend out that harsh edge heart.
Harsh just to blend out that harsh to.
Blend out that harsh edge that's right.
What is wrong with me oh the little.
Stars and stuff forgot about that okay.
First i'm just our back garden by nyx.
White liquid liner and i'm just gonna.
Sketch in a few little stars in the.
Rainbow porsche let's do like a little a.
Moment right out here.
Notice for some little stars i'm gonna.
Pop on a glitter in the inner corner but.
I'm just gonna take a little bit more of.
That liquid liner and add in some dot.
Right on that white shade this is what i.
Like to do a lot too when it comes to.
Putting a bright highlight in the inner.
Corner because sometimes those are in.
Glitters or pigments they only shine a.
Super super bright if the light is.
Heading in but obviously depending on.
Your lighting it you can't always do.
That so what i like to do is sometimes.
Take a white ladder and put a ton of.
Little dots here it's almost like mimic.
The look of glitter because that way you.
Can still layer glitter over top of it.
But even if the light doesn't hit it.
It'll still be white now i just want to.
Take a few different chunky glitters.
Let's see oh i should do like little.
Star drips first huh i'm gonna grab my.
Liner brush and dip into the shade a.
Single and then i'm going to i guess.
Just like drip this down for a real one.
I'm gonna take a little bit of brother.
He's not same little brush now i'm gonna.
Pop on some glitter okay so have a few.
Different chunky glitters that i'm gonna.
Use today and they're often the brand in.
Your dreams on insert i don't want to.
Tip that or it's gonna fall everywhere.
I'm gonna die but they're super dope.
When they have a lot of chunky glitter i.
Feel like for some reason chunky glitter.
Is like impossible to find but it's not.
The only glitter that i ever used cuz.
You guys are i hate glitter period so.
We're gonna put it on i don't get to put.
It on using the peaches and glitter.
Adhesive.
Lots of filing at least i have a few of.
These tiny little stars there's i do not.
Know how far i can tell that before it's.
Gonna fall.
But they're shaped like stars i promise.
Thank you to my sister burrell co for.
Letting me borrow them could i go all.
These little stars on to the bottom of.
Each little like drip as if they're like.
Stars that have fallen out of the sky so.
Cute oh my god so that is what i all.
Complete it i am obsessed with this this.
Is literally one of my favorite looks i.
Have ever ever done and it's also one of.
The longest times i've ever spent on an.
Eye i'm gonna quickly cut and go off.
Camera to the other eye and hopefully.
Not take four hours and i'll be right.
Back with the finished look okay so.
Alright doc i decided on the other eye.
Off-camera this did in fact take me.
Another several hours which is just.
Lovely but it's done and that's all that.
Matters and i feel so beautiful i just.
Popped on a pair of lily lashes in this.
House so extra miami get a new scope.
James for 15% off your purchase and.
That's going to move on to it the rest.
Of the face for the highly unscientific.
My face a quick spread of the more via.
Prep insect siding spray this is my.
Literal all-time favorite and then grab.
The shade of face from the palette and.
Then just grabbing literally on a knee.
For brush you guys thought this my.
All-time favorite combination and.
Putting this right over top just to mix.
The highlight and blush together finally.
For lips might go to a nude combination.
And then just topping it off with some.
Gloss and finally finishing this look.
Off of the mac fix+.
Gold late edition for a little inner.
Glow okay i know literally four hours.
Later this is look number two inspired.
By sister lauren battles all complete i.
Went to this lips today knowing it was.
Gonna be challenging and it definitely.
Was but it took so much longer than.
Expected now you guys know i love it.
Just sitting down and playing with.
Makeup but this took us so much time in.
Patience and precision cutting this.
Crease making sure all the whites and.
All the closure blended together but.
That being said literally four hours of.
Work later i think every single bit of.
That was worth it because i am obsessed.
With how this lecture now i think it is.
Literally one of the most beautiful.
Looks i have ever had on my face like.
Are you literally kidding.
Hello you guys all better go double tap.
This instagram picture once it goes live.
Oh my god but thank you so much to.
Lauren for sharing this look with me and.
For supporting me of my palette it means.
That so so so much this literally goes.
To show that you can do anything with.
This palette if you guys decide to.
Recreate this look at home do not forget.
To type lauren for makeup credit and.
Also tag me so i can see all of your.
Face beautiful looks as well or that.
Further ado let's move on to the next.
One.
Alright so finally on to the last look.
Of the video and i'm a little bit.
Nervous with this one i'm not gonna lie.
I'm assuming if you saw the thumbnail.
This is probably what you clicked on.
This video which is why i kept it for.
Last.
Queen of marketing i'm gonna be.
Recruiting this look today from la via.
Done prints one of my really good.
Friends jose jose is an incredibly.
Talented makeup artists but also truly.
One of the nicest influencers i have.
Ever met.
To this tank such a sweetheart i.
Absolutely love him the most but that.
Being said i am very very nervous for.
This look that i am because this whole.
Makeup look is actually inspired by a.
Marcelo con to photo who is an iconic.
Photographer now if you're not familiar.
With like makeup community history this.
Whole look and effect actually went.
Viral several years ago by a photo edit.
That marcelo con 2 did know i've.
Actually shot with him before his work.
Is literally insane one of the coolest.
Photographers of all time and he's very.
Very known for doing it digital effects.
Now i know for a fact that this original.
Photo that marcelo did it was completely.
Added it on and jose did it with makeup.
And what i saw marcelo's photo a few.
Years ago i've always wanted to recreate.
It but i just generally never thought it.
Would be possible using makeup because.
The colors are so vibrant but sister.
Hosea managed to do and to make it even.
Better he used my palette so i figured.
For the last look today i would try my.
Absolute best to recreate this if it.
Turns out great amazing if it turns out.
God at least it's the last look and you.
Guys would have already clicked off the.
Video early on ok so i think looking at.
This photo and also at this really great.
Condition to charles palette i think i.
Want to start with the highlights and.
Kind of build.
Backwards with the colors ok so i think.
Our first thing i got my own 433 brush.
And open to the shade of playground.
Which is this like teal blue.
Um this is this is my better side just.
Gonna put this like right oh my gosh.
Who's no going back now.
Then i'm gonna bring it like up to the.
Nose but i'm not gonna do is start.
Freaking out okay we're gonna make this.
Positive and i need some more up here.
Too i'm gonna layer obviously a lot more.
On but i think this is a good start now.
I'm gonna grab another m for three three.
And dip into the shade single and i'm.
Gonna use this like below the blues so.
Like right here maybe you're gonna have.
19.
News up to kind of blend together the.
Blue and purple i'm just placing colors.
On here randomly so i don't even know if.

Gonna be a lot of phase two needed to.
Like bring this to life you know what.
That's okay you know i do love i got a.
Face to the moment i am the queen of.
Phase two so you can definitely make it.
Work.
I didn't that brother shade in between a.
Playground and a single definitely makes.
It look way way way better but still not.
Good oh i forgot my brow bone i'll do.
That in a second okay i need to put more.
Things here i've done some single up.
Here next to the blue can add a little.
More purple here i'm gonna go to the.
Shade love that and a little bit more of.
A fluffy brush and use this to not blend.
Out the edges of that purple oh yes yes.
Cess the chief just called and this this.
Is that that was so annoying a little.
Bit of love that in the inner nose area.
I feel like during these videos and.
These table looks they always get super.
Super discouraged when it doesn't look.
Perfect right away but in the end.
Usually happy with that right now.
Definitely at that stage where it looks.
Not good i'm not going to give up and.
Hopefully it looks okay by the time that.
I finish this at this point i think.
That's gonna be out anything that's.
Gonna say this look it's going to be the.
Highlight and like the white so i'm.
Gonna grab an m at four five six and the.
Shade hello.
There's like the bright metallic i see a.
Baby blue from the pellets i'm gonna.
Give it a nice spread of some puppets up.
Because i definitely do you want this to.
Be like very very metallic and i'm gonna.
Start placing this color on the high.
Points.
This is kind of coming together they're.
Not gonna lie gonna pop a little bit of.
Hello right on that inner corner on the.
Tip of the nose also down the nose.
Bridge and on the brow bone as well now.
I want to take another one of the m45.
Six brushes is different to the shade.
Ring light once i get that metallic.
Pearl i want to give that a spread of.
Prep inside and put that like even more.
In the middle this is exactly what we.
Need okay.
Oh i should definitely some on my ear.
Mm-hmm definitely in my ear and jose's.
Personal photo he does have a winged.
Liner on now i fully already have lashes.
On because i was too lazy to take them.
Off before i started this look for some.
Reason and now i'm gonna be really lazy.
I'm gonna try to do my wing liner over.
Top of my lash days is this going to.
Work.
Probably not am i going to try.
Absolutely oh my god i am the queen of.
Savings time.
Look at that wing you oh my god i would.
Normally literally never do waiting this.
Thick but jose's wing was large and in.
Charge today gal so we're gonna match it.
I'll do it on the other eye too even.
Though there isn't gonna be anything.
Over there i guess then i just make my.
Wayne die literally literally perfectly.
Even i'd like to and jose's virginal.
Look he does have the lower lashline.
Smoked out with block you guys know i.
Don't really like putting block on my.
Waterline but we are going to do it.

08 brush and just.
Go right in there oh my god i should.
Have just left that how it was.
Oh i'm gonna use the urban decay glide.
On pencil in the shade at zero which is.
The block when i put this in my.
I guess last i'm gonna pop on a black.
Line with lipstick this is oprah in the.
Shade of the bronx whose coach a misters.

The tendency to over line them way too.
Much oh that is not good mascara all.
Right you guys i think this is the final.
Look final of be done print inspired by.
Marcelo con tu foto all complete i'm.
Really not sure how much better i can.
Get this to look up considering the.
Original was not even actual makeup and.
It was a digitally edited photo where.
Literally anything is possible.
Considering that i think we did okay.
Today i think it looks definitely decent.
With a little bit of facetune though.
This will be good and fresh and with all.
That being said i think those are all.
Three looks all complete i really hope.
You guys enjoyed watching me a recreate.
Or at least try to recreate these three.
Makeup looks on my face today.
Oh my god when i saw these three looks.
From the original artist i was so.
Excited and i just wanted to play and.
Sit down with the palette which is.
Exactly the point of why i made this in.
The first place these artists blew my.
Mind and even if the last look didn't.
Exactly come out quite as planned i.
Definitely had so much fun challenging.
