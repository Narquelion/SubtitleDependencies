Hi sisters at james house here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel i do.

Very sick right now from traveling and.
I've been filming all day long this is.

Thought i wouldn't sit down today and.
Talk to you guys about my all-time.
Favorite brushes that you totally need.
In your set i get messages geum's tweets.
Comments all the time from you guys.
Asking what brushes i love the most what.
I use and what i use them for so today i.

Out my all-time faves that i think.
Everybody needs as their like base.
Starter brush set and recommend them to.
You i'll say it now because there's.
Gonna be a ton of comments on it almost.
Every single one of these brushes are.
From morphe except for a few outliers.
This video is not sponsored morphe is.
Not sending me a check for posting this.
Video and i don't know why people will.
Always like comment speculating whether.
Or not things are sponsored in case you.
Didn't know it is literally illegal to.
Have a sponsored video and lie about it.
Like i'm trying to decorate my apartment.
Not a jail cell not being said i do have.
A coupon code a wedmore fee it is james.
And it gives you 10% off that 10% is.
Commission so it goes to me you do not.
Have to use my color i really could not.
Care less trust me and it's just a.
Discount that is there for you guys i.
Truly do enjoy all these brushes i mean.
The fact that they are this dirty and.
Gross should show you that i use them.
And everything one might look so i.
Really do love their products alright.
Guys so grab a pencil and a piece of.
Paper and get ready to write down a ton.
Of brushes i'm just gonna go in the.
Order of which i do my makeup routine so.
Yeah if you want to see my all-time.
Favorites just keep on watching see you.
Guys know for my foundation i always do.
See beauty blender and it's like my holy.
Grail tool i really do it truly truly.
Truly love it but some of you guys don't.
So the foundation brush that i use when.
I don't use my beauty blender is the.
M4a3 9 and of course i left mine in.
California and cannot find it so you're.
Gonna have to trust me on this one it is.
A good foundation brush i'll put a.
Picture right here and it is $13.99 this.
Video is already off to an amazing start.
The next purse that i want to talk about.
Is the rz r and this is for 2299 this is.
The most expensive brush i'll be talking.
About today after i do all my foundation.
And my concealer and blend it and i will.
Use this brush and go into my trends.
Powder to really really lightly like.
Doses all over the face just to get a.
Light coverage of powder and just to.
Kind of lock everything in before i go.
In and really like bake it up and i.
Always use this to blend on my neck as.
Well because we don't want that line of.
Demarcation keep feeling sisters the.
Next brush that i use in my routine.
Always is the e-40 it is a pointed.
Powder brush it is $8.99 a this is.
Actually the first brush that i ever.
Bought for morphe after my face is all.
Set you guys know i love all the.
Coverage in the entire room so i've.
Always gone with my mac studio fix.
Foundation powder in the shade and three.
I don't know why i'm telling you that.
Doesn't matter but i always use this.
Brush just to pack this right under the.
Eyes and in the center of the forehead.
Chin and then right under the contour.
Area as well it's just like the perfect.
Brush and it really packs the color and.
They're in place but doesn't make it too.
Harsh definitely would recommend this.
One the next one i always use my routine.
Is the r7 and this one is $15.99 this is.
My bronzing brush it is so freaking good.
It's actually like pretty large for a.
Bronzing paddle fluffy type brush i love.
English this is the perfect brush for.
Bronzing oh it really does a really good.
Job with like this person the color on.
The cheeks and then i always lend it up.
On the temple up to it the forehead the.
Other cheek and then on the jaw line as.
Well the only one my all-time favorite.
Brushes after bronzing my necks that was.
Always to contour and for that i.
Actually have two brushes that i always.
Use i have the m4 35 which is $8.99 in.
The m 405 which is $7.99 and i actually.
Prefer the 405 a little bit better.
They are both angled foamy brushes that.
Are perfect for getting right in the.
Hollows of the cheeks and right on the.
Edges at the forehead and carving out.
The drawing as well i like this one.
Because it's a little bit more stiff.
Than this one it's a little bit less.
Fluffy so it's more of like a defined.
Line anyway they work exactly the same.
It might as well just save the dollar.
And get this one at the m 405 after i.
Contour my face i say a short prayer and.
They brace myself because my next step.
Is contouring my nose you guys know that.
Contract my nose has been a long time.
Learning process for me it is something.
That i have struggled with for a long.
Time because my nose is so early it.
Never looks good it still honestly could.
Look a whole lot better but the one.
Brush that literally save life in my.
Nose contra is the jt weighty a 182.
Brush with luxy that is a mouthful but.
This brush.
Literally was that from the hem.
Above this brush was gifted to me an.
Asset at generation beauty so i never.
Actually bought it so i just went online.
To luck see beauty com2 look at the.
Brushes and i lied this is the most.
Expensive brush in this video it is $24.
But trust me when i say oh my god it is.
So worth it i always use the angle tie.
To kind of sketch out what i want the.
Nose contour to be and then this side is.
Perfect for blending it out and making.
Sure that looks like really really.
Snatched but not to like dry coin me.
Although we love that look - i don't.
Have a cold luck see and i know $24 may.
Seem like a lot of money to spend on.
Such a small brush but trust me this is.
So worth it i'm not even kidding this.
Literally saved away from my nose.
Contour and is probably one of my.
All-time favorite brushes as stupid and.
Cheesy as that sounds i seriously would.
Not look decent without it well my face.
Is faking my next step is always to do.
My eyebrows if you've been following me.
For a long time now you know that my.
Brows have gone through a drastic change.
Since the beginning my instagram page.
And it was definitely for the better.
When i first started off my eyebrows.
Were huge i would pack on the anasazi.
Beverly hills different in the shade i.
Bonita they were so freaking dark and.
Thick when i did do that silent brow i.
Would always use an angled brush like.
This.
This is the r44 and it is only 399 it.
Has a spoolie on one end and an angled.
Brush on the other end but recently i've.
Been loving using front pencils just to.
Go for the more light and fluffy look.
That is why it now has pink look a.
Lipstick on this and because i don't use.
This anymore but if you still like that.
Style of instar brow look definitely.
Recommend it this one to check out.
Once eyebrows are all signed plates.
They're probably looking crazy messy so.
I like to go in and clean them up using.
My favorite concealer and a flat top.
Concealer brush does the e43 and it is.
$4.99 this is the only concealer brush i.
Ever use and it is super easy to just go.
Right in and carve out a super straight.
And on fleek brow that is all i have to.
Say about this brush it is just really.
Good once i concealer under my brows.
It's all pointed out i like to go into.
The more concealer on the eyelid to then.
Set my eyes in place to prime for.
Eyeshadow to do this i always use my e45.
And my shape tape and then coating or.
Some powder i use the same brush.
Actually for the powder and liquid and.
This brush is $5.99 it is just a short.
Domed powder brush and it says on the.
Website it is a mini detail contour.
Brush obviously it's a brush you can do.
Whatever the hell you want with it it's.
Never that serious but i really like.
This for packing the eyelid.
It gets all the concealer bended out.
Really really quickly and easily impacts.
Everything in place so i know that my.
Eyeshadow.
Not gonna go any winner with the face.
All complete and be for the heavens we.
Are not ready for a shadow trust me when.
I say you need this brush in your life.
This is the m4 for one and it is $5.99.
It says on the website that it is a pro.
Firm blending crease but there is.
Nothing firm about this brush it is.
Literally the best like big fluffy.
Crease brush ever and i'm not kidding i.
Think i have at least 1 2 3 4 5.
I literally have six of them that are.
Just in front of me and this is just.
From filling my looks today all many.
Other brushes are in the other room it.
Is always the first person i pick up.
When i do i shadow i just use my.
Transition shade and i go all over the.
Crease the i'm four for one is.
Definitely need in your collection i.
Would definitely recommend ordering like.
At least two or three them you will use.
All of them i promise the next one i.
Want to talk about is the m4 33 and this.
Is probably my number one if you're a.
Brush from morphe this brush is $5.99.
And is a fluffy crease brush and it is.
Basically the same thing as the sigma.
E25 in the mac 217 i was like the holy.
Grail crease brush is that literally.
Every makeup whoever has at least like.
50 of it is perfect for hitting right.
Into that crease area it is condensed to.
The point where you distribute this.
Shadow where you want it but it's still.
Flopping so it blends and out while.
You're putting it there six seven yeah.
Seven brushes right here once again one.
Of the ones that i have so many of but.
Literally use every single one of them.
The next part i want to talk about today.
Is the m56 too and this is another one.
Of those that i have several of you know.
When you're doing this multi eye or a.
Half cut crease and you want to deepen.
Out the darker corner and like you don't.
Have a darker shade so you know you have.
To use black but you know if you go in.
With a fluffy brush in the black it's.
Gonna make everything muddy and gross.
And way too dark this is the brush you.
Need in your life it's really really.
Tiny but still fluffy so you can get.
Right into the crease and outer corner.
And blend everything out really really.
Seamlessly i freaking love this brush.
The next part i want to talk about is.
The m22 four and this one is $2.99 i.
Always will go in with some fix+ or some.
Setting spray spritz this brush and then.
Dip into like a metallic shadow or a.
Pigment and then pack it right onto.
Either cut the crease or just do a.
Metallic eyelid it is super duper dense.
So it is absolutely perfect for getting.
The shadow on there and making sure it.
Is all there and superduper pigmented.
Once the eye shadow is done on the top i.
Always want the bottom and i always.
Started the m56 to the same brush i just.
Talked about always get like even color.
On there and then the brush i always use.
The m2.
13 this brush is $1.99 na just a small.
Detailed smudger brush it is perfect if.
You have like anything in the water line.
That you want to blend down or if you.
Just want to deep it up right up close.
To the lash line or do any do to work in.
General really this is perfect i also.
Use this brush for a smoky winged liner.
Back to that ways pop on lashes and.
Mascara and that's just using tweezers.
And mascara not that deep nope artist.
Involved and the last step will be.
Highlighter my first live here for.
Highlighting my cheeks is the amma 501.
And this one is $7.99 personally i am.
Not a fan of fan brushes but i'm right.
For highlighting my face that was not.
Funny i feel like it doesn't.
Blend out the pigment evenly and a lot.
Of times on this end i would like a.
Straight line of highlighter which is.
Never ever the goal so i really like.
This one instead it just gives like a.
Nice fluffy dispersed heavenly glow the.
Last and final brush in this favorite.
Series thank god is the m43 one this.
Brush is $4.99 and it is a tiny pencil.
Brush most pencil brushes are round at.
The end but this one is a little bit.
Tapered off and it does have a slight.
Point so i always use the very tip of.
This brush to go right in on the tip of.
My nose and then i'll just go one line.
Right down the bridge to contour out my.
Nose then with the same brush and more.
Highlighter i'll just go right on my.
Inner corners just blending that out and.
Then i'll pop this on the brow bone as.
Well just for that even highlighter all.
Over and there we go guys that completes.
This favorites of rush series thank god.
