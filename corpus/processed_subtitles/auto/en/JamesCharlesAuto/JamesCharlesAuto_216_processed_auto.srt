Hello do you trust me now come on oh yes.
Queen of bribing let's go come on guys.
Two-faced or la girl i know this is a.
Life-changing decision for you you have.
Got to be kidding me.
To face pulling this layer i'll a girl.
Chrome axe make it a song hello.
You seem like you're a good candidate to.
Choose i feel like this one definitely.
Knows playing okay good that's a chicken.
Hello.
Dobby the house-elf is so soft without.
They're so tall and skinny like me the.
Skinniest legends which one do you like.
Better let's take a poll can you twos.
Hello oh wow hello thank you okay touch.
It out they all voted for to pay for in.
This place oh it looks like my holy girl.
Is a winner.
Good taste thank you alright so picking.
This one was definitely a little bit of.
A task and that is for sure the full.
Mangoes were definitely not wanting to.
Play it's okay it was very early in the.
Morning i don't blame them i really had.
To be one with the flamingos in order to.
Get them to recognize me to trust me to.
Appreciate me and to help me actually.
Choose the foundation and luckily potter.
Though the lingo was nice enough in the.
End and he ended up choosing the too.
Faced born this way foundation that you.
Guys know this is my all-time favorites.
So potter definitely has good taste.
And i was gonna go ahead and apply this.
And his recommendation you guys meeting.
These flamingos was literally so much.
Fun and such a good first step of this.
Video they were all so funny and.
Everything one of them was named after.
Harry potter character and if you know.
Me i literally grew up being the biggest.
Harry potter stan ever i went to all the.
Movies at the midnight premiere is there.
Like my all-time favorites so getting to.
Walk around with hermione and potter and.
Weasley just really made my morning but.
I will say they were definitely not.
Giving me the time of day at first i.
Really had to work pretty hard to get.
Them to trust me and to accept me into.
Their squad of flamingoes but once they.
Finally did it they were so much fun.
That we were just working around with.
Them for a real one i was really.
Surprised because all the fooling those.
Were very much like kind of white really.
Really light pink and all the babies.
Were gray and i was like what the hawk.
These do not look like flamingos but.
Apparently flamingos actually don't get.
Their full-on bright pink color until.
They're around three years of age and it.
Actually comes from the food they we.
Learned that like backwards leg that the.
Flamingos have isn't actually their knee.
Where you'd think it would be it's.
Actually their ankle so their legs are.
Like weird and i don't know if you guys.
Have ever picked up on this or noticed.
This but if you ever look at a video of.
Me standing or if you meet me in person.
My legs are always crossed no matter.
What if i'm standing still my legs are.
100% out like a weird tea angle and it's.
Because i have scoliosis of all my hips.
Is higher than the other one but i just.
Thought it was so funny because i've.
Been made fun about my entire life.
Flamingos sisters i feel you we can just.
Be weird standing people together.
Alright sister so thanks for the.
Flamingos our foundation is all on and.
Ready to go and our next that was going.
To be our concealer oh my god she's so.
Fluffy okay guys so this is all of it.
The porcupine and we're gonna be having.
Her choose between up my two concealers.
Today can't pat her a because it will.
Hurt the most that's right so she has.
Some really really long quills they're.
All underneath that outside whoa and.
Then she can shoot those out right.
Though she can't shoot it out she can't.
Throw it something actually has to touch.
It and their guard so when they stick to.
Something pull away really oh my god all.
I'm saying i sister know how sharp are.
The actual quills they're very sharp she.
Sheds them like regular hair so it's.
Like the worst house cat in the world.
When you accidentally sit down on them.
Accidentally pull yourself there barb so.
Once they're in they actually have.
Microscopic barb's and they'll expand.
And make it hard for them to come out.
They actually will only move in one.
Direction and that's in so they'll.
Actually move all the way through the.
Animal that they quill so it's a really.
Bad day for anything that decides to try.
And eat a porcupine yeah so definitely.
Not having myself oh my god totally this.
Is a mufon video trisha paytas is.
Shaking all of us coming for her career.
Ended over.
I almost an all at the porcupine.
Tomorrow to listen to that okay let's.
Have her pick yeah okay guys so for.
Concealer so that we have our two.
Different options being the tarts tape.
Tape and then also the color pop no.
Filter concealer i'm a huge fan of both.
Of these so regardless of whatever.
Sister olive picks i'll be happy but.
They will definitely change how the base.
Actually looks on camera so let's see.
What sister all of us preferring today.
For our shoes right now which one do you.
Want oh oh my god.
Looks like i'll have picked the color.
Pop no filter concealer we don't even.
Have to bribe her with some food so look.
So we're gonna be getting glam b's in.
The color pop no filter concealer thanks.
Always all right guys so all of the.
Porcupine chose the color pop and no.
Filter concealer today i'm gonna be.
Using the shade a fair and number five.
Just to highlight the inner parts of my.
Face and literally olive was so nice i.
Was little bit nervous to meet a.
Porcupine but she was literally so sweet.
And so fluffy like she looked so cute.
That i wanted to touch her but the.
Zookeeper said probably shouldn't do.
That unless you want to get sister.
Stabbed well what i didn't realize is.
That those white spikes were not.
Actually her spikes they're part of her.
Fur and all the spikes are like inside.
Of the fur and really kind of hidden so.
She looks soft and fluffy and nice and.
Fine and fresh but you get to host her.
And she's sister stabs of you and then.
You die which is just lovely and fine.
What i did not know and i actually found.
So funny is that apparently porcupines.
Are considered the lords of rodent in.
North america first of all i thought.
That was me i'm so funny.
I did not know that they were part of.
The rodent family is the fun fact of the.
Day.
Contrary to popular belief as well.
Because i asked this quest.
And porcupines can't shoot their quills.
Which maybe you'd know but i did not i.
Thought that if a porcupine was like the.
Right hand it could have sister shoot.
Out their quills and like aim at their.
Prey and get them good but that's.
Definitely not the case at all it.
Actually has to make a physical contact.
And.
The quill that goes in the skin and then.
Like opens up so it you can't really.
Pull it out and you can only go further.
And then it kills them this is getting.
Dark really fast.
Point-blank being don't get caught by.
Porcupine is the moral of story but all.
Of us really nice to find in brush and.
Our concealer is done so we have our.
Whole based on looking at so beautiful.
I've actually not used this combination.
In a very long time and i am loving how.
This is looking so far so i'm super.
Super excited these animals definitely.
Have really really great taste but we.
Need to work fast and set this in place.
So let's find a speedy and energetic.
Animal to help us out sister so we're.
Currently in the petting zoo and we have.
Our goat here sets our poncho's gonna.
Help us choose a setting powder today.
We're choosing between the rcm a no.
Color powder and the coverfx powder i'm.
A little bit over sosam because this one.
Is not my favor i've tried this before.
And it gives me flash like mary.
Sometimes and this powder i have not.
Tried i've heard of great things but you.
Never know so i have some carrots to.
Incentivize them and to say a little.
Thank you for helping us shoes today but.
Let's see what punch of the goat has.
Decided for us i love him he's gonna.
Come home with me.
Pelle part of the glam squad team sister.
Oh my god you could be our new editor we.
Are hiring oh hello ha ha yeah ouch.
Handshake oh you're welcome do you like.
That does that feel good i love a good.
Sister scratch which one do you want.
Carrot oh he wants ball ok locally we're.
Gonna be using the cover of x powder.
Today thanks pancho alright guys so.
Punch of the goat was so excited to help.
Us out today he was literally so sweet.
Love him the most ever in the entire.
World.
I think i probably need to adopt a pet.
Goat right now and he chose the coverfx.
Powder and i was gonna use this and the.
Shade light does it my face in place.
Today honestly probably my favorite fact.
Of the entire day is that goats can.
Spend up to 14 hours a day eating mood.
Hello that is me i also thought it was.
Really cool too because the goats were.
In a like petting zoo so a lot of the.
Kids can actually go in and.
They're one of the few animals that you.
Can really interact with at the zoo and.
Although you can actually go in and pet.
The goats and feed them they had.
Actually a roped-off area inside of.
Their pen that if the goats are feeling.
Overwhelmed or tired or just bored and.
Don't want to talk to people anymore.
They can just go in the robes and then.
You can't touch them.
I need that at all times hello also -.
One thing that i noticed when i was.
Closed up with poncho feeding him is.
That goats actually have a rectangular.
Pupil in their eyeball and because of.
This they actually have a 330 degree.
Like peripheral vision and meaning that.
They can see almost entirely around them.
Without having to move their heads hello.
That is the coolest thing ever can you.
Imagine how many fun things we could do.
If we could see 330 around us like you.
Could sister spot straight boys from all.
Angles you could that's a little matters.
Honestly or i guess if you're a goat you.
Can like spot predators but then again.
Spotting straight boys far more fun.
Alright guys sorry face it's all set in.
Place and locked in everybody needs to.
Go it is literally a trillion degrees in.
Los angeles today i am sister sweating.
It for a real one so they got we have a.
Lot of powder but now we need to contour.
Because we're looking a little bit flat.
So let's see how we can really chisel.
Out our face and look nice and sculpted.
Hey girl.
We're here with the draw sister sister.
Athena and today she's gonna be choosing.
Our bronzer  contour so we have the.
Next pro contouring palette and also the.
Too faced chocolate soleil bronzer.
Giraffes remember the species people.
Don't think about as being endangered.
Because we have a lot of pictures of.
Them you can kind of imagine that.
They're really ubiquitous in africa but.
A lot of them their populations are.
Shrinking because their habitats are.
Shrinking so that's why every baby born.
At the zoo is a really good.
Really good news for species oh my god.
The way giraffe society kind of works is.
That the biggest strongest guy gets a.
Group of ladies to be his so we've got.
One adult male in here philip and he's.
Got two adult females that are his.
Girlfriend so to speak one adult female.
That he's kind of interested in and then.
Learning to giraffes that are there are.
His babies his kids sounds like me with.
All the instagram hot boys that i've.
Comment on their photos multiple.
Boyfriends.
Okay sister which one do you want oh oh.
My god okay wow what's that tongue do.
Looks like a cena chose of the knicks a.
Pro contouring palette all right sisters.
So after much deliberation and much.
Bribery a senior the giraffe finally.
Ended up picking the next pro contour.
Palette i'm a huge fan of this product.
Else i really loved the too faced.
Bronzer as well so he's done was.
Definitely gonna be a winner but let's.
Go ahead and contour our face it was so.
Cool learning about the drafts today.
They were literally all so beautiful and.
Just so like majestic which sounds so.
Weird to say but i did not know that.
Giraffes are actually on the verge of.
Being endangered right now they're.
Definitely considered vulnerable which.
Means that they're one step away from.
Actually being on the endangered list.
It's so incredibly sad because their.
Habitats are being taken away and i know.
That there's kind of like a common.
Misconception in zoos of like oh like.
These animals should not be captain zoos.
Like just put them back in their.
Habitats but a lot of these animals.
Don't actually have habitats to go back.
To because they're being destroyed and.
Deforest and so quickly and it was.
Really really sad it was actually so.
Cool too because we got to meet the lead.
Giraffe keeper who was at the zoo and he.
Had literally just gotten back from a.
Several weeks.
Trip to africa to be part of a draft.
Conservation program also which i.
Thought was literally the funniest thing.
Ever.
A lot of the drafts and the actual.
Exhibit were little babies which at.
First i was so confused because they.
Were all equally as tall hello that's.
What john stehr known for and i asked.
How old they were because i wanted to.
Know how quickly they grew and.
Apparently giraffes are literally born.
Out of their mothers.
At 6 feet tall already hello.
I need all boys to be like that first of.
All second of all like oh my god that.
Mother all right i say this what i had.
And i baked my face to really reinforce.
Those highlights but i'm realizing that.
I was just.
Excited about talking about the draw so.
Much that it actually forgot blush let's.
Go ahead and see which animal can always.
Get a little bit of color back alright.
Guys so we're here at the ostriches and.
We're going to ask sister david i love.
How all the animals help like fun and.
Fresh names then this ostrich is just.
David i have the anasazi at beverly.
Hills blush trio in the shade of peachy.
Love you guys some i love a good peach.

Blush duo in the shades adore so the.
Last out of the bowl is gonna be honest.
Tiles here and the bright stars gonna be.
G wyatt let's see which one they eat.

She knew she said i'm not helping you.
Girl you're welcome for that content she.
Said i do not work for free contact my.
Manager beforehand hollywood of course.
Wow ostriches apparently love doing.
Charity work today i think we're gonna.
Go with this away blush in a door.
Alright k so david the ostrich is being.
A little bit sister sassy with us today.
He did not want to help us out so rude.
But finally we ended up going with the.
Joy blush in the shades adore i really.
Really love it this blush to us is gonna.
Go ahead and apply this fun asha talk.
For you just in case you want to learn a.
Little bit more ostriches are the.
Fastest animal on earth that walk on two.
Legs so fun we love a speedy sister.
Alright guys so the next type of our.
Makeup routine is going to be the browse.
The course browse will hire a lot of.
Concentration a lot of precision you got.
To have your brows on fleek.
And what better animal to choose brow.
Products say than chimps chimps are.
Super super intelligent so today they're.
Going to be choosing between the wet and.
Wild brow pencil and also the anasazi i.
Beverly hills one let's see which one is.
Gonna snatch our brows today.
Oh me.
Oh my god how long can i ask you to.
Choose between these which one can you.
Help me oh which one oh definitely.
Someone while pencil hello i'm sure most.
Of you guys already know this but.
Chimpanzees are actually the closest.
Cousin to humans so like they're.
Technically our sisters kind of so fun.
Love that for us but literally just.
Let's talk about beforehand chimpanzees.
Are already endangered which is once.
Again so sad and they're closely related.
To us - how are we humans ruining that.
So sad like a little bit this blows my.
Mind it's like disgusting all right man.
Eyebrows are finally kind of done that.
Loda just took me 30 minutes.
What in wild ancestor chimpanzees i love.
You guys the most ever in the entire.
World but we'll never be using this.
Again so we're definitely gonna take the.
Owl here move on to the next step which.
Is going to be our i shadow alright guys.
We're here with sister evelyn at the.
Karela and we're gonna hopefully have.
Her choose our eyeshadow today so you.
Have the anasazi a soft palate and also.
The jeffree star cosmetics thirsty.
Palette - definitely very very different.
Color schemes and let's do it sister.
Evelyn was feeling today evelyn do you.
Like the soft glam no she said no too.
Soft glam.
She said we wanted to color today ladies.
Anasazi softly i'm sorry girl out the.
Window.
Looks like using the geoffrey start.
Thirsty kala today i'm down for those.
Have not gotta play with this cat sister.
Evelyn do you like these colors great.
Alright guys so evelyn the gorilla ended.
Up choosing the jeffree star thirsty.
Palette i'm so excited to play this one.
Today and also as well which i thought.
Was so cute and i just realized.
Literally now filming this video evelyn.
Was a western lowland gorilla and she.
Actually had orange and blue on her face.
And look at the palette she picked.
Literally hello orange blue queen i'm.
Gonna start archiving a fluffy crease.
Brush and dipping into this shade right.
Here at the name of which i cannot say.
On camera being that this is a.
Family-friendly youtube channel but it.
Is calling my name and i'm gonna pop.
This right in the crease just to kind of.
Start off our eye look today.
Honestly have no idea what i'm doing yet.
I'm just gonna play around just like the.
Gorillas dead that was a really bad pot.
Let's see what i could come up with this.
Is like a hybrid between like an orange.
And a pink and a peach this color is so.
Pretty i'm obsessive oh wow.
Next under up a little fluffy brush and.
Dip into the shade quench it's this.
Bright yellow shade in the bottom right.
Here and i'm just gonna lightly go over.
Those edges to make sure they're nice.
And blended out super super similarly.
And obviously unfortunately to the.
Giraffes and the chimpanzees the.
Gorillas are actually endangered and not.
Only are they endangered by they're.
Actually what's called critically.
Endangered meaning that they're you're.
Literally about to be extinct.
Fortunately though there are so many.
Programs and so many people working.
Tirelessly and putting in so much effort.
To do everything that they possibly can.
To keep carlos alive and well and with.
Us here on planet earth similar to the.
Giraffe keeper the gorilla keeper tania.
Actually travels to africa all the time.
To work actively towards gorilla.
Conservation in the field we also found.
Out - on the very very geo so i don't.
Know if i'm supposed to tell you guys.
This but tanya actually personally funds.
Trekking permits in order to send.
Rangers out there to protect the.
Gorillas against poaching which i.
Literally think is so so so cool so.
Honorable and i hope i'm allowed to say.
That but i just think that is really.
Really dope and it shows that there are.
Truly good people out there working.
Actively to save these animals next time.
To grab the shade a stroke in the upper.
Right hand corner and use this to deepen.
Up the crease just a little bit i'm.
Gonna grab the shade - rizal and i tried.
A little fluffy brush in the bottom.
Corner and use this to deepen up the.
Crease in the outer v i literally have.
No idea where this look is going just.
Like none of these animals know where.
Their habitat is going.
That was a good pun but a serious pun.
I'm gonna use the excess concealer and.
Cut the crease and then right on top of.
The concealer i'm just gonna grab the.
Shade a filthy rich and packed that.
Right on for a nice little pop and then.
Just going right back into the original.
Shade i'm just going to blend out that.
Edge make sure there's no harsh lines oh.
That's pretty.
Hello all right guys need to finish off.
This i looked today for the lower lash.
And is gonna be super simple and it's.
Going to add in a bright pop of blue so.
I'm gonna grab the shade submerge right.
Down here this color is so so so so.
Ending and i'm just gonna put this right.
Up against the lower lash i think this.
Needs a winged liner so.
Like separated oh supposed to be a small.
Wang she's big and beefy.
I reckon that is one gorilla inspired i.
Have looked all complete i'm gonna go.
Finish the other one off the camera and.
I'll be right back to finish off the.
Rest of the look.
All right scissors i am back i just did.
The other eye on camera and i popped on.
A pair of lashes cruelty free and.
Definitely not mink of course i felt.
That a pair of house eyelashes ikonics i.
Used to herd these lashes literally all.
The time and they are so beautiful and.
Stunning hello.
Most we have moved on to the next step.
Which is going to be our highlighter.
Alright guys so the otters are coming in.
To play with us today i heard that they.
Love sparkly and shiny things and hello.
Is same so i'm gonna have the twos my.
Highlighter today and i have the wet n.
Wild highlighter and also the brand-new.
K'kaw beauty highlighter so let's see.
Which ones these guys want to choose.
Hello would you like this one oh oh this.
One really likes sister cam alright.
Sister said between the two of these are.
On our friend definitely chose the k'kaw.
Highlighter he's following this one all.
Around in the pool it was so so so cute.
I'm little obsessive otters but they.
Just rent down the water side and left.
Us very very rude because her keeper is.
Feeding them but also i don't blame them.
For leaving us for food i would also do.
The same thing so for her later today of.
Course so gonna be using it the.
Brand-new k'kaw bd highlighter palette.
Could have dip into these two shades as.
Chosen by at my otter friends i was.
Literally convinced that i like wanted.
To adopt an otter after meeting them.
They're also so so adorable and so cute.
But otters submerged a lot of the other.
Animals were like you know today are.
Actually endangered due to habitat.
Destruction which is so incredibly sad.
And our target at the zoo is actually.
Telling us how it's a really really.
Awesome thing at the zoo when they.
Actually get a new litter of otters.
Because of the fact that it's like.
Giving them a home and it's furthering.
The population because there aren't much.
Of them left and zoos are kind of one of.
The only place that can actually exist.
Safely.
Music.
Alright guys so now that we are all.
Glowing for the god our last up of the.
Day is going to be our lips for this.
We're heading into the one exhibit that.
Are you know we don't want to turn today.
And that is the layer with all of the.
Reptiles and amphibians if you guys know.
Me you know that i have a major fear of.
Snakes whoa and a lot of other reptiles.
So hopefully this using process will be.
Okay i know we'll be safe but just a.
Little bit concerned and hopefully one.
Of them will be able to choose our lipid.
You do dots we have our morphe lipsticks.
And you change to 10% off and then also.
A kylie liquid lipstick both really.
Great options to finish off this lock.
Hello career what one do you like oh.
Does he like the more feel about it he.
Definitely likes the morphe lipstick.
Oh good taste hold on i'm still in the.
Bouton definitely just show us the.
Morphe lipstick i'm really excited.
Because these just came out the formula.
Is literally at the last minute i wrote.
Good taste sister longer though thanks.
To our sister a boot on front end he.
Ended up picking the abort be a brand.
New lipsticks of course use code change.
For 10% off i'm gonna mix together the.
Shades caught and flirt super fun fact.
About the bouton now that my lips are.
Done and i'm gonna set my face in place.
Since we've been talking it so.
Negatively about extinction and.
Engagement this entire video it was.
Thought that the bouton was actually.
Extinct and told in the 1980s when they.
Actually discovered the species living.
Again and alive hello we love a safe.
Sister literally me coming back for all.
My scandals are my sisters i think my.
Makeup look fully chosen by different.
Zoo animals is now complete and oh my.
God i literally love how this lecture.
Notes today like hello i feel so.
Beautiful all these animals had.
Obviously amazing taste and today was.
Generally so much fun i want to say a.
Major major thank you to the la zoo for.
Working with me on those videos today i.
Know the zoo sometimes can have a.
Negative connotation with them and have.
Had a little bit of a controversial past.
And not even gonna lie going into this.
Video today i was a little bit nervous.
And skeptical but everything that i saw.
And everybody that i met and everything.
That i learned today taught me the exact.
Opposite every single person we met from.
The zoo right from our tour guide.
Katherine who is literally the sweetest.
In the entire world to all the different.
Zoo keepers you could tell we're so.
Passionate and so knowledgeable.
About their jobs every single question.
They asked they had a million different.
Answers for and we're really just so.
Excited to tell us everything about each.
Animal it was so blatantly obvious to us.
How much each different zookeeper.
Actually took care of their animals and.
Was so passionate about their jobs some.
Of them literally even making at their.
Own personally funded trucks to the.
Animals natural habitat to work on.
Preservation and to learn more i know.
There's a common misconception about.
Zoos and the mistreatment of animals and.
Listen guys i was very skeptical when i.
Went into this as well and it was.
Actually really cool because i did get.
To actually ask katherine our tour guide.
About this and she even admitted that.
This definitely was a huge issue in the.
Past but a lot of zoos now are working.
Actively on preservation and.
Conservation to fix the reputation that.
Was given to them so many years ago i.
Know it's very easy to see an exotic.
Animal in an enclosure and think oh my.
God this animal needs to be released.
Back into the wild it doesn't belong.
Here but in reality a lot of the animals.
That we got to meet and interact with.
And learn about today we're critically.
Endangered meaning that they don't.
Really have habitats to actually go back.
To zoos are kind of one of the only.
Places left where they can actually.
Exist safely as a species and at least.
Humans will get to learn about them and.
Appreciate them and do anything we.
Possibly can to keep them here for as.
Long as possible i want to say a major.
Major thank you to the la zoo for.
Working with me on those videos today.
This video was not sponsored at all but.
They really went above and beyond to.
Help us out today and make sure that we.
Got an amazing fitting with a bunch of.
Amazing animals the la zoo actually won.
An international award last year for.
Conservation which literally is just so.
Cool and truly shows how much work and.
Love they put into their jobs every.
Single day so i encourage you guys to do.

You can do actively to help because i.
