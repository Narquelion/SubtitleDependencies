Hi sisters my name is james and welcome.
To the first ever episode of the james.
And ian show i'll use sisters out there.
Now that we've even posted several.
Videos together on my youtube channel.
And it's all just he acts like he's.
Hated them we have been having a lot of.
Fun doing them together i'm bored of.
School i decided i want to be social.
Media famous too so we decided that.
We're gonna make a video every sunday.
Discussing various topics today we'll be.
Talking about relationships if you were.
Able to know the perfect boy what would.
It look like it yah-hey for personality.
There's one buzzfeed producer that i'm.
Like right now named eric so his.
Personalities yeah shout out eric i.
Would take like one of the dolans bodies.
Slap on like cameron dalas face and then.
Like the talent of shawn mendes no.
You're perfect it body okay finally.
Jenner's face uh-huh oh that'd be a good.
And fresh sister i feel like.
Relationships for me are very like a.
Weird a topic to discuss being that like.
You have to find some that you like want.
To hang out with them be your best.
Friend but also like because you want to.
Get on top two straight boys well you.
Got me there.
When it comes to relationship like.
Opposites are supposed to attract right.
And i'm very gay so like if i'm in a.
Relationship with somebody i need.
Someone to like balance me out right so.
That's why i always go for like very.
Masculine muscular type men and normally.
Those are like the straight it's also a.
Fun challenge like if you know me you.
Know that i definitely love a good.
Competition and for me getting with a.
Straight guy is like winning and a.
Sister loves winning so examine your.
Relationships and jamie's convinced he's.
Better relationships excuse me i am we.
Decided to ask you guys can you love.
Problems and we're gonna give you some.
Really good relationship advice yeah.
Sister jack said my ex-boyfriend cheated.
On me two times and wants to get back.
Together okay well fool me once shame on.
You fool me twice shame on me.
I want to go for the third time.
Definitely not amanda dolan responded.
With broken with my ex because he was.
Being very control.
My supposedly friend is now with him lol.
Okay all relationship problems aside.
That is not a true friend right there.
You need to cut her out of her life.
Before you get him out of your life kind.
Of both off all we ride a cow jenna.
Asked my crush will not notice that i.
Like him and i'm so obvious about it.
What do i do.
Holy jenna i will just be honest with.
Him and tell him that you like them.
Because honesty is key in a relationship.
Demo we asked no man likes me i would do.
You help of that i'll let you know when.
I find out golf sister alfonso last i'm.
Gay and i like a guy i don't know a.
Sexuality what should i do.
Literally welcome to my world that.
Sounds like i asked the question as.
Someone who is ella best many many times.
In the past crushing on straight boys.
Are boys that like you do not know what.
The tea is it's sometimes important to.
Ask but not on an offensive way because.
Sexuality obviously something that is.
Very very private and it's nobody's.
Business but their own unless they.
Decide to share it so usually i think it.
Eventually comes out in a conversation.
But i definitely do have one crazy story.
That i think i want to share with you.
Guys today okay i'm really paint the.
Picture for you so you can like really.
Relive the story with me so like there.
Is one social media boy that i will not.
Name for security purposes from the.
South no like i message this person on.
Snapchat because he had posted like a.
Gym a flexing picture and i was like oh.
Wow yeah and he actually ended up.
Replying and he said oh my god james.
Charles i can't believe you just thought.
How to meet my girlfriend loves your.
Videos he watched them together all the.
Time.
I don't think oh thanks so much sister i.
Had hot makeup on because i had just.
Finished filming and a few minutes into.
The conversation he sent back a snap.
That was like wow you're the most.
Beautiful boy in the entire world and i.
Was like why and i've like thought he.
Was kidding like i talked to a lot of.
Straight guys still that like i'm not.
Flirty with that i'm like genuinely.
Friends with but they're always like.
Playing that game just like really get.
Me know one gal and it's annoying but.
Like i'm used to it at this point so i.
Thought he was kidding around we kept.
Talking and this boy is close to my age.
And he was like you're just so.
Successful like at our age of how do you.
Do that and i was like well i work hard.
He was telling me how he really wants to.
Move to la and be an underwear model so.
I was like okay like interesting so does.
Every other little white boy from the.
South so.
I was like well if you want to be model.
Let's see what she got at this point i.
Was thinking he was still messing with.
Me but he started sending a bunch of.
Photos in his underwear and me being the.
Absolute supermodel that i am i didn't.
Ask for input.
I started critiquing his photos that's.
The oh your but luckily about in this.
One like your faceless really about it.
This one like get it together gal if you.
Want to be an underwear model.
They kind of step your game up somehow.
The conversation shifted to like his.
Body and holly wanted to look better and.
Then like to relationships and asking if.
I've ever been a relationship and then i.
Told him no what are you doing ignore.
That and then whom i'll see got my.
Hookups which i've also all ended very.
Very poorly to them him saying oh i feel.
Like you'd give her very good if you.
Know where i'm going with that so i was.
Like yes i do but why are you asking and.
He's like oh i would totally let you at.
That point the realization that he was.
In fact not kidding and was being dead.
Serious hit me like a bus going a.
Million miles per hour well he does that.
Has heard of this or he gets interesting.
Yeah so he started getting intense.
Artistry and started sending more photos.
That weren't exactly appropriate if you.
Get what i'm putting on the table here.
He was saying all this stuff and.
Flirting with me and he told me how he.
Like wants to fight a california i'm.
Like take me on a date and then like do.
Stuff at the end of the night and it to.
This i was like as hot as you are and as.
Much as i am enjoying this conversation.
I am not doing anything with you if you.
Have a girlfriend and you know what he.
Said to me i don't he literally said and.
I quote she's a huge fan of you and if i.
Told her she would not even care.
Oh so she's a sister yeah apparently a.
Real true hardcore sister i need to take.
A step with my pink drink this is.
Getting intense after viewing this.
Obviously i was like very very shocked.
But i assumed because he said that his.
Girlfriend wouldn't care and like knows.
That he's apparently not straight that.
They were in some type of like open a.
Relationship type of situation so after.
Hearing that i was in it to win it.
00 in the.
Morning as well so i'm sure you can.
Imagine like what was going on in.
The brain at this week and things.
Started getting really really flirty or.
Really fast and also very very out of.
Hand and apparently yeah if a photo was.
Not a - was obviously a lot of details.
To the story that i do not need to get.
Into but i will say that this very long.
And late night ended with him facetiming.
Me and doing his business after that.
Night fast-forward and he completely.
Ghosted me for two months straight.
His girlfriend probably found out we're.
Getting in there so i sent him a really.
Really long message that basically said.
If you do not want to talk anymore i.
Understand why i do not blame you i.
Don't want to come in between your.
Relationship and i do respect that but i.
Respect you as a person as well and i.
Generally had a really good time talking.
To him he was super sweet the night we.
Talked sexual aid sin that is obviously.
Really really hard to do but then.
Clearly a sister was confused so i.
Basically said if you ever need to talk.
To you about it but you know you can.
Trust and like that will give you good.
Advice as someone who's been there.
Before i got you and to that message he.
Literally sent back the rudess reply of.
Mansoul oh yeah very very salty what.
Really got me good though and is the.
Kicker of this entire story is that it.
Was his birthday a few days ago happy.
Birthday man no not happy birthday and.
He came up on my explorer page on.
Instagram because i never actually.
Followed him in the first place but i.
Saw a picture of him and his girlfriend.
Still happily together and i noticed.
That he had unfollowed me on instagram.
And i was like oh this is rude but i had.
Sent him a happy birthday text which is.
My second message to him over the entire.
Process of the thing he ignored it did.
Not reply and at that point i was like.
Oh who at his game over you played with.
The wrong girl but i'll putting this.
Aside the situation is obviously been.
Like on my mind for the past several.
Months because they caught feelings for.
Him fast it's very clear yeah and i also.
Felt really really bad for the.
Girlfriend after all this went down.
Because clearly something was going on.
And i thought she knew at this point so.
I sent a sister a message on instagram.
Asking her to facetime me asap because.
It was digging at me and i really just.
Wanted to tell her the truth tea.
Basically i told her girlfriend the full.
Story for i let's start to finish in.
Full detail which was so incredibly hard.
For me not only was i like super.
Incredibly embarrassed of what i had.
Obviously done being.
I had no idea that she did not know what.
Was going on clearly he lied you didn't.
Do anything but it definitely was.
Assault yeah hundred percent but also.
Just seeing her being so happy and what.
She thought was a genuine relationship.
It'll be coming crashing down like over.
A facetime call was just way too much to.
Handle obviously she was very very.
Alarmed and overwhelmed and who wouldn't.
Be and i told her that if she had any.
Questions are needed to talk to me.
Throughout that day that she could.
Totally come to me i would be there for.
Her and she told me that she was going.
To see him later on so she would.
Confront him about it not even 30.
Minutes later i started getting the most.
Gross disgusting text messages from the.
Boy who i have not talked to but i've.
Tried to reach out to several times in.
The last two months i've ever seen in my.
Entire life.
They contained racist slurs homophobic.
Slurs just literally everything you.
Could possibly imagine.
He literally started calling me psycho.
And mentally unstable claiming that i.
Made everything up yeah i'm sure you.
Imagine him something using a show as.
Nine-inch just wondering what was your.
Thought process thinking you'd make all.
This up do you have a lawyer i literally.
Do not know that was my thing too like.
Why would i literally call somebody at.
10 in the morning while i was doing my.
Makeup in the middle of like going to a.
Photo shoot just to say like hi i'm a.
Complete awful person and i got photos.
From your boyfriend who you're in a.
Happy relationship with and i'm now.
Calling you to admit that because i care.
About you and don't think you'd like.
Deserve that but apparently i'm lying.
Like hello i did not tell the story.
Today to try to like expose the two.
People i'm definitely not about that but.
I think that this does have a really.
Good message behind it that a lot of.
People tend to forget when they're in.
Relationships sexuality is obviously a.
Very very hard and uncomfortable topic.
For a lot of people to deal with i'm.
Very lucky to have an amazing support.
System in my family but for people like.
This way that i'm talking about it.
Sometimes becomes a situation where.
You're in the closet or you're in denial.
And even though we had a really great.
Time on facetime that one night doing.
All that stuff he turned his confusion.
Into literal targeted homophobia towards.
Me and exchange for helping him which.
Not only put me in a really horrible.
Situation his beautiful girlfriend who i.
Spoke to and that i can tell it's a.
Really really genuine and kind person is.
There an absolutely tax relationship.
That she has absolutely no idea about.
And it's clearly delusional over and the.
Boy is gonna have to live with this in.
The back of his mind for the rest of his.
That not only did he cheat on his.
Girlfriend but he also like really.
Messed with me.
Yeah after hearing that i would also.
Like to add that although relationships.
Might seem perfect you have to put your.
Own well-being first because really she.
Didn't and ya didn't turn out too well.
It's definitely very important to listen.
To the people around you who care about.
You and love you because they usually.
Have your best intentions in mind.
Absolutely i feel like that's really.
Just took me at 76 years to towel but.
Yeah do you have any crazy cross stories.
Maybe my dms are quite interesting but.
That's for a later video.
