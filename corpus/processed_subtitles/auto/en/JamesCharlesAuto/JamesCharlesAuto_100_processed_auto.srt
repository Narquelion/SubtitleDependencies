Of my past videos have been some crazy.
Outside of the box looks which i know.
You guys and myself obviously love so.
For today's video i really want to tone.
It down just a little bit and doing more.
Classic but still gorgeous glam look.
Which is perfect for the upcoming.
Holiday season i created this dark.
Cranberry smokey eye with double glitter.
Liner glow of course in this dark purple.
Lip i absolutely love how it turned out.
As always all products and discount.
Codes will be listed in the description.
Below and if you want to see how i.
Created this look make sure you keep on.
Watching to start off this tutorial.
Today i'm gonna begin with my morphe 35o.
Palette and just wanted the light orange.
Shades on my morphe m4 4-1 brush this.
Brush is great for blending out creases.
And that is exactly what i'm doing so.
I'm just putting the shade right into.
The crease using windshield wiper.
Motions and circular motions to really.
Blow this color out if you want.
Everything to be it nice and blended i'm.
Then going with the darker orange shade.
On my m4 3 3 brush and it defining the.
Creates just a little bit more same type.
Of motions there's gonna be a lot of.
Different colors going on to this i want.
To make sure everything is seamlessly.
Blended together and then with that.
Excess color i'm just going back in and.
I'm going to shade in the eyelid same.
Brush same exact color once we have.
Those colors placed on there i'm going.
Back in to the m4 for 1 and the light.
Orange transition shade i'm gonna buff.
All of those edges to really make sure.
Everything is nice and blended out to.
Begin my lower lash in i'm going into my.
M4 33 and the dark orange shade from the.
35o palette and i'm gonna begin to buff.
It into the lash line i'm not gonna go.
All the way into the inner corner.
However because we are gonna be putting.
A pop of highlighter there and i really.
Want to make sure my eyes look nice and.
Open.
Same thing from before i'm using my m4.
For one in the light orange shade just.
To buff over the edges to make sure.
Everything is super blended out we.
Really don't want any harsh edges with.
This and it's really gonna come in handy.
When we add the purple's which is going.
To be right now i'm going into the dark.
Purple shade from the 35b palette.
Friendly reminder you can use code james.
For 10% off all murphy products.
I'm just using my m4 33 and brushing the.
Shade all over the lid just to create a.
Nice cranberry color repeating that same.
Step again i'm going back into that dark.
Purple shade on the m of 433 and just.
Dusting that shade lightly onto the.
Lower lash line i'm once again not.
Focusing that on the inner corner but.
Rather the outer and kind of creating.
That v-shape that we know and love.
Unlike all of my j charles eye tutorials.
To finish off the eye shadow portion of.
This look i'm going in with my m56 to.
Brush and the red shade from the 35 p.
Palette and dusting this in the crease.
This is really gonna help the purple and.
The orange blend together and kind of.
Create this like blended sunset smokey.
Eye type of situation you get what i'm.
Saying you know we're just kind of move.
Right out of the liner i'm using the.
Morphe gel liner in slate and maya m25.
0-0 brought to create this sharp and on.
Fleek weight i am drawing the swing.
Pretty thin because i am gonna be doing.
A double liner and i'm gonna be using.
Glitter so i'm just kind of try to keep.
This pretty like subtle so it's not like.
Over attacking my eye this voiceover is.
Seriously a mess i apologize it is very.
Very late at night i just returned for.
My trip so give me a chance and i also.
Ordered a microphone as well so these.
Voiceovers are soon gonna be a lot.
Better quality yeah i heard you guys.
Talking about it and i promise i'm.
Working on it anyways i'm now taking my.
M.
213 brush and taking that dark purple.
Shade that i was using before and.
Buffing out that black liner that i put.
In the waterline just to create a nice.
Even transition and make that bottom.
Waterline superduper smoky and dark then.
To make sure that it's nice and blended.
Out and that i don't have a block i i'm.
Just going in once again with the m56 2.
And the red shade from the 35b and just.
Buffing over that line superduper.
Lightly for the double glitter liner.
Portion of this look i'm going with my.
Mac mixing medium on my morphe gel liner.
Brush obviously not the same one that.
Had the black liner on it from before.
And i'm just dipping it to my copper.
Alla glitter from violet voss i figured.
This glitter would match absolutely.
Perfectly with the cranberry and the red.
And it did i really really love how this.
Looked i'm just super carefully laying.
Glitter right over top of the black.
Liner being pretty careful to avoid.
Fallout but to fix it up i'm going with.
My nyc liquid liner obviously in black.
This liner is super duper opaque so it.
Really helps to cover over any follow on.
That black liner from the glitter after.
Putting on mascara i'm just quickly.
Popping on a pair of false lashes i.
Honestly do not remember where these are.
From but if i can find the name i will.
Leave it in the description below i've.
Been wearing these for a few weeks now.
And i do not remember i lost the box but.
They are pretty similar to how slashes.
