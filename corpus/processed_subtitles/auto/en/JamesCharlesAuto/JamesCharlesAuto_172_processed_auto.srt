Hi sisters james charles yura and.
Welcome back to my channel.
Music.
Getting straight into playing this video.
Is when we're going to be very long son.
John i want to take up any more of your.
Time on this intro it has been far too.
Long since i have like the silent kind.
Of just chatting with you guys so sooner.
You're excited to sit down with them a.
Little bit of a chit chat with me a.
Style video i asked you guys on twitter.
To send me a bunch of questions about.
Like my life makeup whatever you wanted.
To know under the sun so today i thought.
I wouldn't sit down and just talk to you.
Guys i put together this brown winged.
Owl smokey situation and i decided to.
Pair it with this blue a periwinkle.
Custom lip color and honestly you really.
Really love how it turned out i also.
Brought back at the fake freckles which.
I have not worn in a long paralytically.
Time and i forgot to put on a half of.
This video so this is definitely a very.
Very weird type of situation for me to.
Be in i don't exactly feel like myself.
But honestly i really really like.
Sitting down and talking to you guys so.
If you want to just chill relax and hear.
Some questions being answered about me.
And see how to create this definitely.
Strange and unique makeup look.
Make sure you keep on watching oh hello.
Everybody i am currently a barefaced.
Well no i'm not because i'm putting out.
A primer but the hair is shaved.
I got a fade on the size thank god it.
Was looking a little manly before not.
Gonna lie right now i'm currently.
Rocking the pepper from american horror.
Story look but you know what we're just.
Gonna move on and probably put on a hat.
As soon as humanly possible i feel like.
It's been literally months inside like.
It's not that i talked to you guys i've.
Been it so really busy with my move to.
La and just so many different things.
Going on and i've been really really.
Slacking on youtube and kind of every.
Social media lately so i'm so excited.
Now that everything is like kind of.
Settled down a little bit and i am back.
And ready to kill it i really wanted to.
Sit down today and do a little bit of.
Like a chip shot get ready with me a q&a.
Style video it's been far too long since.
I have like just talked to you guys and.
Nothing like a really really serious.
In-depth tutorial so i really do miss.
That a few days ago i had tweeted on my.
Twitter i just want to focus on you guys.
I'm communicating.
Um there because i really feel like i.
Don't talk to you guys enough and that.
Is something that i definitely want to.
Change so if you don't want me on.
Twitter definitely go follow me i've.
Been tweeting a ton of you bear that the.
Infalling when two people as well i.
Don't know why i didn't do this sooner.
But hey it's never too late to be bad a.
Shitty influencer right i'm gonna be.
Blending this foundation away good tone.
My next today as you can see a sister.
Spread hen is looking a little splotchy.
I have an appointment later on this week.
Perfect in time for coachella this.
Weekend i am so freaking excited and i.
Hope that i'll be seeing a ton of you.
Sisters there it'll be me and laura and.
Hey-zeus and victor all going together.
It's gonna be such a good time so if you.
See me and you better freaking say hi i.
Honestly have no idea what i'm gonna be.
Wearing yet so i'm horrified but.
Hopefully i figure something out because.
The last thing that everybody wants to.
See is me naked trust me.
Earlier on twitter when i was planning.
On what i want to do for this video when.
I decided i was going to leave a little.
Chitchat q&a style video i'd tweet it.
Out asking for questions and stuff like.
That you guys no need to talk about so.
I'm going to be answering them as i do.
My glam today the first question is from.
Mac and she asked if you could do what.
One kardashian's makeup who would you.
Choose and why well i think i would have.
To choose obviously a sister kim just.
Because she is a living legend and i.
Have a personal bias to her because i.
Had the honor and blessing of meeting.
Her she was so frickin nice literally an.
Angel sent from above so i asked lee.
Loved her and would love to have her up.
One day but maybe lee after mario dies.
Because that's his job and i do not want.
To compete with a legend.
Zoi house where do you think your life.
Would be if you never picked up a makeup.
Brush and not oh wow that's honestly.
Such a hard question because i genuinely.
Have no idea just a year ago i was not.
Even doing this and now i'm living in.
Angeles with amazing friends and amazing.
People and doing what i love and am able.
To make a career out of it this all has.
Happened so quickly for me and i've.
Loved every single moment of it but i.
Probably would still be sitting in a.
High school classroom learning every.
Single day chase asked what is your.
Skincare routine and how do you get rid.
Of weird spots and pimples on your face.
That's a really good question chase and.
That is a question that i get asked all.
The time and unfortunately my answer for.
You guys is literally just wash my face.
In the shower i know that sounds like.
Complete but i swear to god i.
Do.
Literally no skincare what just.
Definitely gonna come to bite me in the.
Ass later on i definitely want to do.
Some like research into finding good.
Skin care products soon is just not.
Something that i've really like really.
Cared about in the past and i don't.
Really know why that it's either i used.
To have very very very bad acne people.
It's good when i was like in fifth sixth.
And seventh grade but it kind of like.
Just went away and i really had to deal.
With it it's weird too because with me.
When i don't wear makeup for a few days.
Then i'll start to break out i'm.
Definitely not the person to ask when it.
Comes to skincare advice i'm so sorry.
Brandon asks what is one thing you love.
About your career and one thing that you.
Hope to do in the future.
Answering this while doing my nose.
Contours already it's killing me because.
Y'all know this takes a lot of focus but.
I'm gonna do my best.
How about favorite thing about my career.
Is just getting to me all of you guys i.
Know that's like so chase that's what.
Everybody says but it truly does like oh.
My god if you guys ask any of my friends.
If i'm having a shitty day you have no.
Idea how much it'll like instantly turn.
Around as soon as i see one of you guys.
Like in public or something even just.
Like getting happy tweets from you guys.
Just truly just makes my day you have no.
Idea how cool it is to just know that.
You have like an entire platform of.
People from all around the world.
Watching you and supporting you loving.
You it when times get tough and trust me.
They do for everybody it's really just.
Like nice to be able to just get support.
From you guys and hear all the nice.
Things you have to say that's definitely.
By far my favorite part of my job as in.
The future i really don't know what the.
Future holds i have a lot of ideas and.
I would love to work on i'll see you.
Guys know that i love to sing so i.
Really want to do a more musical stuff.
In the future but that's hard as well.
Because like producing and directing and.
Blah blah blah so i'm trying to work on.
That as if i have nothing immediately.
Planned but the second i do have.
Something and you guys know it'll be the.
First people to know so just keep your.
Eyes open but there's a lot of cool.
Stuff in the works coming soo that i.
Have the scenes for now i'm just gonna.
Focus on youtube and seven just having a.
Good ass time nicole said cereal then.
Milk or milk of m cereal well nicole i.
Have news for you i don't drink milk so.
Cereal then more cereal dry as seer.
House do you before doing a more.
Creative looks or more glam looks for me.
The answer to this question is extremely.
Obvious but i think a lot of you guys.
Might think differently and that is for.
Sure.
Creative looks 150 percent honestly i.
Hate doing glam looks literally more.
Than anything in the entire world i.
Don't know why i feel like they're just.
So boring we've all seen the same with.
Ron sophie i have 50 million times yet.
Here we are i've gotta do a.
Bronze smokey eye in about ten minutes.
When i finish do brows creative.
Avant-garde out there makeup looks got.
Me to where i am today.
They got me all my followers and they.
Are truly what i enjoy most about makeup.
I love putting a ton of really crazy.
Stuff on my face it's like creating art.
Honestly but one thing that sucks about.
Them is that those books can take up to.
Like five six or even seven hours.
Depending on how complicated they really.
Are so it was much easier than wiener do.
Back home when i was like still just.
Starting off now it's much harder for me.
Because i'm just so busy and i have.
Something on every single day it's.
Really hard to get five or six or seven.
Hours free but i really am trying to get.
Back into it i've been trying to set.
Aside some time recently and i've been.
Like panning a lot of things on.
Pinterest and like saving a lot of.
Pictures for inspiration so definitely.
Keep your eyes peeled because i really.
Really want to get back into career.
Stuff soon but yeah i definitely prefer.
A creative makeup looks over going on it.
Any day of the week nicole asked james.
What is your opinion on.
Well nicole if you couldn't tell about.
My thirsty instagram comments on their.
Pages almost every single day or my.
Tweet to them or my idioms to them.
Asking them to country the face i.
Haven't lovable for them and i'm very.
Very open to a brother-husbands style oh.
My god this joke is already going down i.
Love the dolans ones that i want them.
Both to punch me in the face and then.
Make out with me if that answers your.
Question.
Haley asked attending vidcon you asked.
Question mark unfortunately no i will.
Not be attending vidcon this year i'm so.
Freaking sad because i really really did.
Want to go but i just found out a few.
Weeks ago after i had already booked my.
Tickets to vidcon that is the same.
Weekend as my graduation back in new.
York across the country so unfortunately.
I'll not be a bit calm but i'll be at.
Playlist live in orlando in a a few.
Weeks i am so freaking excited so if you.
Are going to that i will be there.
My meet-and-greet just kind of knows i.
Think i'm competing great number of 20.
On saturday don't quote me on that but.
Definitely check it out get some tickets.
I can't wait to meet all of you sisters.
I've asked how do you like living alone.
In your new apartment and are you gonna.
Do it in a permit or soon it is very.
Weird and yes absolutely i have been.
Working for the past few weeks actually.
On an apartment tour video i'm working.
With a graphic designer to kind of make.
Like an hgtv style thing it's gonna be a.
Big production this sounds weird but i.
Promise when you see the apartment or.
Video you guys are going to be shocked.
To the frickin core i do plan on doing a.
Either two or three part series of it.
I'm not on a percent sure yet but it is.
Gonna be a big thing on my channel that.
I'm very very excited for so please stay.
Tuned and one of those videos will be.
Like a q&a on living alone and how i.
Like decorated it and how i handled the.
Boob so i'm not going to answer that for.
Right now.
Stay tuned it'll be coming within the.
Next few weeks but i'm like officially.
Done decorating and fully like.
Settled on and i'm gonna so pretty busy.
Lately and i was just traveling and now.
I'm going to a hotel this weekend and i.
Just had a friend sing with me so.
There's gonna walk going on i will be.
Done soon i promise.
I want these videos to be like really.
Good so it just be patient they're.
Coming.
Gio asked what is your favorite pool of.
All time.
Whoo i feel like i should really say.
Something from like one of the scissors.
Apparel's hoodies but honestly it's.
Probably work smarter and not harder i.
Think that's something that like i.
Always apply it to my life and i feel.
Like it's a really really good quote to.
Like live by yeah that's kind of how.
Like that's how i like to work every.
Single day and like make sure that i'm.
Doing the best i possibly can.
Work smarter not harder or it's not that.
Deep victoria asks how do you cope with.
All the negativity you receive i truly.
Admire you for sticking to career.
Instead of taking a break thank you.
Victoria that really does mean a lot to.
Me i think it's something that you.
Really have to learn to deal with as a.
Social-media influencer and it's.
Something that is really like it's.
Really really hard to kind of like grasp.
The fact that when you do this job and.
You have this lifestyle.
Everybody's gonna be watching everything.
That you do and i think that even now.
Today being where i am it's still.
Something for me that is really really.
Scary to think about and something that.
I honestly don't even like wanna think.
About at the end of the day if people.
Are talking about you and mentioning.
Your name and wasting their time talking.
About you not only is that free.
Publicity and free press but that means.
That you're successful so when i see all.
These negative tweets about me i just.
Try to keep in mind the fact that like.
Okay these people are talking about me.
And day in and day out because i have a.
Name for myself and because i've gotten.
Myself to where i am today it's a really.
Like kind of twisted way to look at it.
And it's kind of sad that i like it even.
Has to be that way but that's the.
Reality of the job that i have a very.
Very thing before i am and i'm so.
Thankful that i have.
You guys because if it was not for you.
Guys i definitely would have quit a very.
Very long time ago but i have so many.
Amazing sisters out there that are all.
Loving my work and loving the things.
That i do and that is truly what keeps.
Me going the negativity that all social.
Media influencers get is definitely like.
The number one downside to having this.
Job it honestly can make some days so.
Beyond miserable a lot of people will.
Seem to think that oh like your.
Social-media influencer you make all the.
Money in the world you have all these.
Friends and you get to do fun things and.
Well yeah some of that is sure i.
Definitely have a lot of friends and.
Gets do a lot of cool things and i.
Definitely am making a study and kama.
817 which i am so thankful for i would.
Never take for granite money does not.
Buy happiness there's no amount of money.
That anybody can in the bank account.
That makes them happy take it from me as.
Someone who has a lot more money than.
Most seventeen year olds i definitely.
Still go to bed upset many nights out of.
The week it's just something you have to.
Learn to cope with and that sucks to say.
But you didn't have to think about the.
Positive and think about what you're.
Gonna do next to get through it and how.
You gonna handle this situation yeah.
Kristine asked how and why did you come.
Out well christina came out of the.
Closet when i was 12 years old and the.
Way i came out is definitely a little.
Unique and different to say the least so.
I plan on doing a story time video about.
It eventually please stay tuned i.
Promise it will come out just right now.
It's still a little bit too soon but the.
Second i turn 18 we can talk about it oh.
That sounds weird i've been asked what.
Is your dream car by the way i love you.
And i'm in love with my sweater from.
Sistas apparel ah thank you sister ellen.
I love you too girl my dream car that's.
Actually a really really hard question.
Up until recently i've never actually.
Been like a car person even still i'm.
Kind of not now that i live in downtown.
In la i don't actually have a car i then.
Rank everywhere because i have up my.
Credits from and you guys using at my.
Code shout out to all of you for that.
But i'm actually thinking about buying a.
Car in this summer and i definitely i'm.
Looking at a lot of.
Options but i'm really leaning towards a.
Cheap they are really really cute and.
They're not too expensive either well.
Apparently they're awful on gas mileage.
So i generally have no idea but my dream.
Dream card is probably like a g-wagen.
All those in the next few years i will.
Have a matte white g-wagen in my.
Driveway on my modern at california.
Mountain homa but as of right now a.
Sister is dealing with her tubers sarah.
What is your go-to order at chipotle my.
Order is exactly the same and at this.
Point all the workers at my local.
Chipotle and know me so i don't know if.
That's like cool or really really sad.
But either way my order is a burrito.
Bowl with white rice no beans chicken.
And then a mild salsa lettuce cheese.
Guac yes i know it's extra and then.
Oh wait that's it then i was going to.
Sign up chip symbolic as well and a.
Fountain drink for the road and my total.
Is a 1589 sometimes they gave me the.
Sisters discount all right i'm gonna do.
The other eye off-camera really quickly.
Then i'll be back and we can finish off.
The rest of the face with more questions.
I just want to take up anywhere every.
Time because i feel like this video is.
Already getting very very very long so.
Brb so i just wanted to finish my eyes.
Off camera just to it save a little bit.
Of time so you continue on with the q&a.
I use the black liner for the upper.
Waterline and a nude liner for the lower.
Waterline of course i had a pop on my.
House lashes like products for the.
Lashes today and i just bend them.
Together with the benefit roller lash.
Mascara eight and ass we're to get the.
Idea of calling your fans as sisters.
This is actually one question that i get.
Asked all the time and i don't think.
I've ever actually adjust it in a video.
Before so this is like a good time to.
Answer i guess i personally hate the.
Word like fans more than anything in the.
World i think it is so incredibly tacky.
And ugly to call like followers and.
Supporters the fans who i just i don't.
Know why i just really don't like it.
Sisters are so started this past.
Halloween.
You guys do not see my halloween costume.
I was a little bit of like a dead deer.
Type of situation it was a very very.
Intricate costume but you guys know me i.
Always need my baseball hat on laurens.
Dad basically helped me cut holes in a.
Leather hat but it was where so i could.
Put antlers stuart's second where the.
Antlers and the hat at the same time.
Loading me being extra as helper and no.
Reason at all.
But i was super super appreciative and.
He literally pulled it together out of.
Nowhere so i was like damn super.
Impressed and when he handed me the hat.
I don't know why but i just said thank.
You sister marco don't know where it.
Came from don't know like why it came.
Out my mouth because i had never like.
Said it before but and then i was just.
Thinking like what should i call my.
Followers because i adored fans then i.
Was like you know what i already called.
My best friends which are basing with my.
Family sisters so why not call and you.
Guys sisters as well just because like i.
Like to look at you guys's kind of like.
My family and close friends as well so.
That's why you were all sisters anne.
Tolley said if you were going to go to.
College what would you study this is a.
Great pressure that i actually get asked.
All the time and it's honestly something.
That i'm not really quite sure the.
Answer uh when i was applying to.
Colleges and looking at colleges i was.
Looking at different majors and.
Specifically like marketing and a social.
Media stuff.
Obviously i wanted to do something that.
Was going to be your focus towards so.
That was gonna help me with my career.
Later on but obviously a lot of the.
Class i was looking at the different.
Schools it seemed very very like.
Outdated and just seemed like they.
Weren't gonna be very much help to me.
Basically however once who i asked about.
Like lessons that they had in their.
Social media marketing class and the.
Moment basically told me one of the main.
Things that they focus on is like.
Finding your target audience which yes.
Is a very important part of marketing.
And she was like well one of the biggest.
Lessons we learned is how to find your.
Age group so basically if you're going.
To be targeting older people you want to.
Go on facebook and if you want to get.
The young kids you're gonna want to go.
On instagram and i was like there's a.
Lesson on that and she's like yeah it's.
A huge part of the program when i heard.
That for the first time that is when i.
Knew that college definitely it was not.
Gonna be for me i definitely do not.
Claim to be an expo to anything i.
Believe there was always so much to.
Learn but i am definitely a very very.
Hands-on person taking a class on a.
Concept that i've literally known and.
And then executing throughout my social.
Media career since like age 7 when i ran.
A club penguin blog should not be a.
Lesson that i need to take in a college.
Setting where i'm paying several several.
Several several several thousand dollars.
My parents money that they don't even.
Have in the first place so at that point.
It was like a unanimous decision between.
Me my family that college definitely was.
Not gonna be for me and they were on.
Board and now i'm here in los angeles.
And i'm learning more every single day.
Being like anza and doing stuff like.
That and marketing every single day with.
My manager that i would ever learn in a.
College classroom setting so i feel like.
I definitely made it the right decision.
Definitely look into it and definitely.
Do a lot of good research before you.
Made the decision as well because i.
Believe education is a super superduper.
Important i graduated high school a.
Super high average and i'm very very.
Proud of it but i definitely think it.
Was right for me and my family to not.
Continue on but definitely do some.
Research and decide what's best for your.
Situation for how later today i'm going.
To pop on the eclipse highlighter from a.
Jeffree star cosmetics this is in a.
Collaboration with many of you i i am.
I'm so freaking oops i am oh my god oh.
Wow okay how are you doing today the for.
The lips today i was originally planning.
On this one from anastasio which now.
Looking at it on the camera would look.
Really pretty so i really hope that i.
Don't regret this but i'm gonna go to.
The anasazi lip hell up today i'm going.
To custom mix the color somebody mixing.
The shades primary five which is blue.
Primary one which is white and then a.
Little bit of nine which is purple.
Speak' a periwinkle color this is the.
Combination of the three colors that i'm.
Gonna go for today i hope that i don't.
Regret this but i guess let's go ahead.
And put on.
Ah okay i really like this color this.
Would have been a really good.
Alternative hello to finish off this.
Look of course i'm going to set my face.
Using my urban decay oil slick setting.
Spray and then use my pal i'm just going.
To dry that setting spray into my face.
To lock everything in place and to just.
Make everything kind of melt into the.
Skin and finally zoe asked james could.
This be your last question yes sister.
We are done all right guys and this is.
The completed look that we put together.
I really really hope you enjoyed this.
Little chitchat get ready with me like i.
