Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel in.
Today's video i'm going to be finally.
Addressing and talking about something.
That you guys have been asking me about.
For years now i've avoided this topic.
Completely if that i have gotten.
Thousands of comments there have been.
News articles written about it and there.
Have been countless tweets that ago on a.
Ridiculously viral with hundreds and.
Thousands of different likes on them all.
Asking james are you julie pav.
Now i will say the public is never.
Actually seen it myself and du liebe in.
The same place at the same time so you.
Can form your own opinions but we have.
Seen a lot of dooley pose iconic musical.
Moments and you think we've also seen.
Some of my less iconic musical moments.
So i think it is safe to say.
Unfortunately i'm not do a lip balm but.
That being sad i've seen your tweets.
I've seen your posts sometimes i just.
Don't see it but there's other times.
Where i'm like oh my gosh we look so so.
Similar so for today's video i thought.
It'd be super fun to transcend that i've.
Never actually done before on my youtube.
Channel and that is a celebrity.
Transformation in to do a lipa let's get.
Started.
Music.
Okay you guys i am so excited for the.
Transformation at today at du liebe is.
By far my favorite pop stars right now.
Her music is so good she just keeps.
Releasing a bomb after bomb after bomb.
After bomb.
I also think she is it so stunning it.
Starting off i popped on this a fun.
Little green turtleneck because she.
Wears a lot of a bright colors and i.
Also popped on up my darker brown.
Contacts because she has super dark eyes.
The first step we're going to do before.
Actually applying any makeup is.
Something super fine that but i'm also a.
Little bit nervous about and that is.
Face tapes if you don't know what these.
Are these are a super like.
Behind-the-scenes about a beauty hawk.
That are used in a lot of hollywood.
Movies and on set all the time they are.
A tiny little plastic sheet and you.
Stick it to your face and then used it.
The other one to the other side and you.
Pull and it gives you a super snatch.
Look so i thought this would be good for.
Today transformation it because do it.
Does have a little bit more of a pull to.
I than i do what i love the look of so.
We're gonna try this up for the first.
Time i actually watched on my favorite.
Makeup artist makeup by her roots to an.
Entire video on these so i'm going to a.
Try my best to apply these today but if.
You guys want to check these up for.
Yourself check out her brushes video so.
I definitely want a little facelift so.
This whole thing will stick better now.
Oh my god this one looks a little long.
That's one notch loser tell us about her.
Okay cool i know these face tapes look.
Absolutely insane right now but don't.
Worry it the makeup will go on over top.
Of them and they won't be noticeable and.
Then once the wig goes on if you'll even.
See them at all these are not for.
Everyday use although if you want to be.
Stash off the time be my guest.
I think this looks super cool but it's.
Now time to do all the makeup on top.
Before doing this video today i left.
Through to his entire instagram page cuz.
I really want to emulate her makeup.
Style.
Best way that i possibly can and the one.
Thing that i noticed is that she does.
Always do i find that pop of color on.
The eyes but for the base it's honestly.
Like kind of natural she does always.
Have like a little bit of a medium.
Coverage foundation a little bit of.
Blush a little bit of glow but there's.
Never too much contour never too much.
Under-eye brightening it's like kind of.
Even which is definitely very different.
For my typical makeup style but i.
Definitely wanna emulate that today so.
I'm gonna grab the effendi beauty at pro.
Feltzer hydrating it foundation who.
Actually i do want to color cut a tiny.
Bit first just because duly put is in.
Fact a woman and i'm not and and a 3 and.
A 4 o'clock a 645 shadow as well now i'm.
Gonna go in that foundation and to start.
Buffing it into the skin i'm actually.
Gonna add it just a little bit of at the.
Pro filter foundation in the shade at.
210 which i know is a little bit darker.
Than my natural skin tone i did say the.
2020 is gonna be the year i'm matching.
My foundation but i do want to make this.
Transformation as accurate as possible.
And i feel like do it it's a little bit.
More tan and than i am so i wanna make.
Sure that that is reflected for.
Concealer today as always i'm just gonna.
Use my tarte shape tape but i'm only.
Gonna put a little bit of this.
Underneath my eyes where i have some.
Slight discoloration a little bit on or.
A lot a bit on my beard area and then.
The center of the forehead and then i'm.
Also going to use my brush to above and.
Now before i go in and set this all in.
Place a powder for a bronzer today i'm.
Actually gonna grab a cream bronzer just.
This la 10 so gosh it's too late hon.
Deschanel and i'm gonna put this on in.
The same type of like a shapes that i.
Normally do because the one thing that.
Is super similar about us is our facial.
Structure oh my god you literally can't.
Even see the face tapes on camera whoa.
And then just using a flat brush this.
One is i don't know the label is robbed.
Off of it i'm just gonna grab some alarm.
Rca translucent setting powder and cut.
This so for contour today it's always in.
This figure my anasazi a contour kit and.
I am 405 bucks but i'm going to.
Literally use like none of this i just.
Want to kind of reinforce a little bit.
About bronzer that i put on it almost.
Looks like she has like a little bit of.
Like wander on her chin darry even say.
Like at least in a lot of these photos.
It does oh now this nose contour i'm.
Scared about because dewa doesn't.
Actually contour her nose like at all.
And.
But he's been watching my channel for.
More than approximately three minutes.
You would know that nose contour is.
Pretty much like the most vital step to.
My makeup routine i love a pinched and.
Snatched nose but i'm not getting that.
In today's video she definitely has a.
Much more like almost like triangular.
Squared off nose tip whereas mine is.
Very round and bulbous so although she.
Doesn't know contour i am gonna try to.
Add some of those shadows in to make my.
Nose shape look a little bit more like.
Hers so i'm going to grab some of that.
Powder and i'm going to run that along.
The bottom edge of my nose okay that's.
Like it was crazy okay that's like.
Exactly it though i'm also gonna grab a.
Little bit of that darker powder and i'm.
Gonna make two dots like right above my.
Nostril she has a shadow here in her.
Nose before i jump into anything else.
I'm gonna finish up the base so for.
Highlighter today i'm gonna grab at the.
Morphe dimension a stick in the shade.
Effect one i don't remember what video.
Ideas is then but i have been using this.
So much since then it is such a good a.
Cream highlighting formula so i'm just.
Going to i never start drawing this on.
And do it definitely likes a lot of.
Highlight in the center of her forehead.
Which i've got a respect to it okay and.
Then for nose highlight once again it's.
Very square so i'm gonna draw in like a.
Kind of straight line across the top of.
My nose now the one thing that do a does.
Like use a lot of in her looks is blush.
And you guys know i have been obsessed a.
Blush recently this one is the brand new.
Kylie cosmetics blush in the shade of.
Pink dreams that this color is a.
Stunning so i'm going to apply this.
Using my morphe x chocolate hill @jh o-6.
Brush and i'm just going to put that.
Right over top now we get to move on to.
The part of the look that i have been.
Looking forward to since the beginning.
Of this video and that is do as eyebrows.
She has super super bushy unruly brows.
Which i love so so so much and so my.
Favorite brow sales to do obviously i.
Have very very thick brows myself so.
This shouldn't be too hard to achieve.
But i do want to add at some hairs and.
Make sure that they are nice and shaped.
So i'm first angle and with just a clear.
Brow gel to brush the hairs upwards it's.
So i kind of know like what direction.
They're gonna go in for this lift today.

That this product is actually do ended.
And one end has a super super tiny and.
Sharp brown marker.
