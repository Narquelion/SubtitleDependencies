After you said about today how do you.
Get into the hair you just kind of blend.

Son do yeah okay second one you have to.
Be a woman you just gotta have some sort.
Of ambition yeah life you know like.

Two out of three it's pretty good yeah i.
Watched the first video what we don't.
Want your eyebrows back this ha just.
Take it a sharpie i know there are bad.
What's your three qualities you look for.
In a partner i would say my link biggest.
One is also sense of humor i did save my.
Number two would be like understanding.
Is a huge thing for me yeah just because.
Like the life that i live is strange and.
Like i need someone who like not gets it.
But consoling common sense yeah and then.
My third would be like it'll be a hot.
Barber oh okay it's just like a haircut.
All the time you know i know one year.
Barber sophie okay taste of my own.
Medicine yeah.
Ethnic that's next concealer okay.
Concealer you just claw blonde yes mix.
It around there good give it a shake.
Jeff where do we first meet question -.

We met on facetime we did meet on facing.
For the first time yeah no we met here.
In this room yeah we did but all the.
Magic we've never left is he's had me.
Chained up in here please help if you.
See this smash like two million likes.
And they'll release me.
Okay blend it back in yeah i think i fit.
Into your genomes for the first time no.

Say.
You said of course hey we throw teams i.
Mean yeah i don't know my favorite lime.
For less mm well i see i'm doing said.
While you're so hot and i remind you.
Again you said it while you look so good.
You said omg so do i said i said.
Omfg so do you okay i sent back the gasp.
Emoji and he said lol within the cute.
Little i'm not good at taking.
Compliments no i can tell and you asked.
Me what i was doing i said just.
Photoshop makeup set you a selfie and.
You said can you do my makeup and i'll.
Give you a haircut i said he i gasp i.
Said i hate putting hot guys and makeup.
Yeah which is cheryl smart i wouldn't.
Want to be in it but i was just trying.
To make conversation then you said favor.
Light here we go here we go.
Ello i probably wouldn't like it but.
I'll try anything once haha almost.
Everything i love trying lots of things.
One of my favorite pastimes thanks have.
You ever looked up with a girl.
Yes yeah yeah like made out but like it.
Was this before that you realized that.
You yeah.
Before and after i'll see you went back.
For fun yeah wow have you ever hooked up.
With a guy before.
No oh my kid that i said i just thought.
It only flirting with straight guys who.
Are and trust that and he said no you're.
Doing great so after all this i didn't.
Know much about you at this point i'm.
Just joking around and stuff but you.
Told me that you have.
Turned out straight guys it elaborate on.
That because you are famous celebrity.
And you do you do live in hollywood yes.
Where there's a lot of guys that will be.
Clout chasers is the new term yeah they.
Were using so you think it was somebody.
That was maybe looking for something to.
Return from you yeah okay cool yeah.
Let's talk about it in science in.
Regards like lgbtq people there's what's.
Called the kinsey scale so the get this.
Goes for like zero to sex zero being.
Like completely straight yeah and six.
Being like completely gay okay and i.
Truly believe that the amount of people.
That are a flat-out zero or a flat-out.
Six is like very very small i think that.
Most people are very close to the ends.
But there's a huge percentage in the.
Middle too if i had to put myself on it.
I would put myself at like a 5.5 so.
You're not even full gay i mean know.
There have been girls in the past that i.
If i thought were really really.
Beautiful there's also been like trans.
Guys in the pasta too that i would like.
Really early into for a moment in time.
Especially living in la where.
Everybody's like a lot more open-minded.
I think that honestly like the majority.
Of guys are like wanting to experiment i.
Used to hear rumors like that all the.
Time i like big big celebrities that.
Growing up already is like what really.
That's crazy because i grew up in staten.
Island where it was like and i'm and you.
Know couple years older than you so my.
Group of friends growing up everybody.
Was going for that same like tough guy.
Yeah straight guy image and i didn't.
Have any gay friends so it wasn't until.
I moved out that like i finally started.
Meeting gay guys and working with them.
And like barber shops or salons i'm just.
Like really having a relationship or.
Like you get to talk to them about more.
Than just the same    yeah so like.
For me for example like i am a guy.
Identify as a guy but i still call.
Myself a woman all the time yeah as a.
Joke and stuff but like i do try.
Everyone said well i have full nails i.
Have a hair on occasionally yeah so it's.
Like for a lot of people like those.
The--my as someone who's just pretty as.
Opposed to mimic a man which is fine.
Like that's how i like to see myself as.
To is just someone who's like a pretty.
Human person yeah so like a lot of.
People are willing to look past and.
Experiment and see like if they'd be.
Into it to choose a song that they.
Either always wondered or they're into.
Me as a person and i.
That's super super cool and.
Unfortunately that a lot of times leads.
To a hookup or like making out or.
Hanging out and then the next day.
They're like we're adding and never.
Talking to me guys or there's.
Internalized homophobia that has been.
Built up so long that led to them.
Wanting to experiment in the first place.
But then once they do it they're like eh.
Oh gross and then i'll start getting all.
Sorts of death threats and angry.
Messages from them the next day after.
You guys monster it'll be or it'll be.
Like a repetitive thing where it's like.
Hey let's keep doing this on the dl and.
It's a very very strange we're all but.
It's like you know what you're kind of.
Getting into when you're behind the.
Scenes but i truly do feel like there's.
Like a spectrum and everybody falls on.
It at some point and like especially.
Right now - like in the world i feel.
Like there's a major emphasis on like.
Labels and for me personally like i do.
Think labels are really really important.
Because it obviously spreads awareness.
People can be educated and also like.
Young kids that don't feel welcome can.
Be a part of something and can label.
Themselves but at the same time - i also.
Think like putting a label on something.
Especially yes there is a sexuality.
Before you're fully understanding what.
It is can be really really toxic come.
Fix your the memes that are gonna be.
Made from the soup into me like what am.
I thinking in my head i'm taking it yeah.
I get it and that's like that's you can.
Like you should be able to experiment.
And like test out different things and.
Talk to different people as like long as.
There's some sort of instruction that.
Whether it be to their personality to.
Their image even d is actually - and.
Link doesn't necessarily feels like that.
You have to put a label on how do you.
Deal with homophobic comments i don't.
Care you don't start this and you never.
Did know did you like girl out of that.
Oh is this the one where i brush on the.
Highway no this is where you contour my.
Face okay this is where the video i.
Didn't get to see the rest of it did you.
Get 42 minutes in there long video video.
So this goes around the bones yeah like.
Right like wrap it here make it look.
Nice and chest hold okay i want to i.
Want a little overboard on that side.
Pounce at him have it in yeah yeah i.
Have a question for you job speaking and.
Like relation to what you just asked me.
Yeah because like after our video that.
We did together there are a lot of.
People come to me like wow james and.
Jeff's like interaction was so cool.
Jeffersonian earth himself public i knew.
We were straight obviously believe.
Looking back yeah it was really cool to.
Watch and like it was funny too because.
I think a lot of kites aren't.
Comfortable enough with themselves to be.
Able to make those type of jokes how was.
That reaction for you the fan reaction.
Was mostly positive sometimes in person.
People will come to me that i don't know.
And they joke around with my sense of.
Humor and they'll come up to me and be.
Like oh where's your boyfriend at or.
Something like that i'm like what the.
Hell you're talking about it first but.
Then i get it they're your fans and.
Stuff like that they just know that i.
Grew up around a lot yeah they want to.
Make that first impression memorable.
Yeah yes i was interesting i'm getting.
Used to it but i'm always growing him.
And trying to learn as a person but i.
Did see on twitter some really positive.
Tweets and that was really cool to see.
That people could kind of move past that.
Toxic masculinity if i could have my.
Audience and and kind of do do something.
Positive yeah then i think that'd be.
Pretty cool that we have that effect on.
You on twitter yeah at least you know.
We're gonna do how are you - yes let's.
Keep it up.
Nice i think we're pretty good on this.
Stuff i'm ready to move to the next step.
Oh hi i think you just gonna pull out a.
Sharpie no okay so kind of what happens.
In barber and you stretch the skin up.
Yeah with this - yeah i'm a natural.
Here's something mister start my own.
Makeup channel oh wow look at this this.
Available right now it is sisters -.
Apparel calm do i choose the iconic.
James charles like morphe palette oh wow.
Yeah about time a james charles product.
Comes out here it's the only one i have.
Is it yes how come every time i hear.
Somebody talking about james charles.
They're like all these things sold out.
In minutes cousin yes but this is what.
It is this is the james stroke all like.
This thing alright now i'm looking at.
This i have no idea what's going on.
There's so many different colors this is.
Harder than i thought no it's not let's.
Do last year's coachella look okay.
What was her first impression of me very.
Funny and like good at delegating.
Responsibility to everybody and kind of.
Organizing a shoe thank you buddy and.
Organized for two great qualities do me.
Know what was your first appreciated my.
First impression was that you were.
Insanely hot people know me for making.
Like jokes at hot guys and stuff but i.
Was not ready for you to start making.
Them back at me so i would like i was.
Shocked that was nothing about the head.
The next question is could you tell that.
Your significant other liked you i mean.
Yeah what is your favorite thing your.
Significant other has ever said to you i.
Mean probably just that like you thought.
My videos are funny because like you.
Give me the compliments about like being.
Good-looking i don't know how to take.
Those what was your favorite thing i've.
Ever said to you i can't i can't i can't.
Do this man it was a joke and welcome to.
Joke it was just a friendly text i send.
It to all my guy friends i don't think.
You dad you're right next question so.
I'm gonna teach you guys a little trick.
You guys at home this i learned from.
Barbering but it could also work for a.
Situation like whenever you go into a.
Job on a new person you're a little.
Nervous no matter what i don't care what.
You say it's like you have that fear of.
Messing off yeah however that you know.
So what i would do on like a lineup cuz.
The line if you can't repair so i would.
Keep like one finger on the skin and now.
If you move or i'm a little shaky my.
Hand moves with your face so you kind of.
Have that like extra stability so i.
Think that'll work for something like.
This.
All right put a little extra finger is.
That okay don't be shy get in on there.
And use that as as your as your base job.
That actually looks so good thank you.
That's funny the that's like the thought.
Swing letter anybody's ever dying now.
This is really my favorite part about.
Makeup uh i never stood back i never pay.
Attention at any other part oh he could.
To the other side it's not done yet it's.
Almost how did you do what i literally.
Perfect and you can't get the amount.
Even you know i got overly confident.
It's not the same at all yeah you're.
Right it is next you want to do the.
Highlighter sorry did i get it right use.
Highlighters to highlight your bone.
Structure yes so we're gonna highlight.
The areas where the light would hit you.
Yes you want to do a little tap yeah.

Think here right if we got married who.
Would win an argument i always let the.
Other significant other wins oh my god.
Yeah i'm winning what a massage yeah i.
Just don't even bother great for rent to.
Me well what's next.
Weird you like to put a lipstick on so.
You can really taste something i don't.
Like lipstick man oh easier to make out.
Without it yeah just like this is true.
It's just like all this stuff on your.
Face and you go to kiss it's just.
Something in the way that's gonna get on.
Me now and i'm not a fan of lipstick.
