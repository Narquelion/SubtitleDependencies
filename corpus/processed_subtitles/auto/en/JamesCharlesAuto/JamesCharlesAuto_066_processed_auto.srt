Hi sisters team shelter and welcome back.

Early rise and shine.
I encourage the effort right now with.
All my best friends we're about to head.
To las vegas nevada for a meet and greet.
Today at an ulta beauty location along.
With murphy in honor of the mini palette.
Collection at lunch i thought it'd be so.
Much fun to bring you guys along with me.
And all my best friends as well we only.
Have a little bit of time between the.
Plane taking off and the actual meeting.
Great so i got to get glam super super.
Fast so i thought i would take you guys.
Along with me for a fun little private.
Jet flight come on in.
Music.
All right you guys the office or plan.
Ahead of us i'm just gonna go ahead and.
Get right ready for some reason cassie.
And hey-zeus managed to convince me to.
Do my eyebrows before everything else.
Whatever let's scoot well because you.
Guys really never ever do dot but i.
Thought it'd be easier to do when the.
Plane was like on the ground and like.
Not moving so this waited like tatcha.
Water cream to give myself some moisture.
It is so tiny called what do we know.
Because getting it very very cold but i.
Freakin i love this time of year so much.
Because it's winter vibes slowly grows.
Chilly girls for foundation i've been.
Mixing together to what different.
Foundations and that is first the dior.
Air plush open opinion are you want to.
Use a narrow saul's on planes is it.
Going to explode oh we're good okay okay.
I've been using this one and then.
Obviously the to pay for this one you.
Guys knows my all-time favorite just.
Kind of mixing it the two together for a.
Nice contraction on the hog like this.
I'm just gonna blend this.
Oops i forgot to color cracks color.
Correcting over top of this i mean okay.
Covered a little bit of dragon candy.
Color corrector mama mama i thought i.
Would try to like use a few different.
Things than i receive because every time.
I makeup i use the same    which i'm.
Sure you guys are really bored of all.
Right you guys i'm not exactly sure when.

After i announced my show that i am.
Filming i'm leading from channel and i.
Just wanted to first of all say thank.
You guys so much for all the love and.
Support about the show i was definitely.
Not prepared for the response that i got.
I've only been working on this for a.
Really long time so in the world.
No i guess just like seeing the whole.
Community like actually come together.
Like be excited or something was really.
Really exciting for me obviously a few.
People even started uploading their.
Audition videos to youtube which was a.
Crazy thing of all i thought it would.
Definitely changing a few days we will.
To get ready but nope there's already.
Some lip videos they uploaded which just.
Is like literally the coolest thing ever.
While this color does not match my neck.
At all for once it looks to pay our moon.
Loves to say james your foundation is.
Way too yellow you.
I always say no i actually really don't.
Think that looks like a    beer.
Every single day and this is what.
Happens when i use a pink foundation.
Tomic concealer and conceal this.
Lighting in this plane is done in oh my.
God i don't know why i'm not getting.
Ready on it this was a good wow okay i'm.
Just gonna contour the living hell out.
My forehead because this whole dinner.
Situation oh no this is not good.
What oh my god this is the fastest night.
Of my entire life.
I wanted to do like a full eye shadow.
Luck what this way is going away faster.
Than anticipated which i have spooked.
About okay so we're gonna try to do two.
Eye shadow look with the mini palette.
Super super fast in my reveal video for.
The series i had on a neutral brown like.
Just matte look which i have never done.
Before but i literally was obsessed at.
How i looked and i felt so beautiful and.
I actually got a lot of comments on it.
To it which made me really happy so i.
Wanted to do like a very similar look.
Today so i'm gonna grab a little bit of.
A team on an m4 33 brush i'm gonna put.
This in my outer corner just like pocket.
Into here and there's gonna pull that.
Into the crease just like this then i'm.
Gonna go back into that same brush from.
Before and a little bit more of punch me.
Honestly i'm gonna get a little bit of.
Hoola bronzer as well so it like kind of.
Warms it up a little bit i was going to.
Buff out that.
Well i think this is the worst eye.
Makeup has ever lock i'm so scared.
What's going on right now i'm gonna try.
To cut my crease now a little bit of.
Concealer which i'm scared for because.
We're on a moving vehicle a vehicle i'm.
Grabbing the shade of canvas on another.
Fluffy brush i'm just gonna use this to.
Holding up her landing i feel nauseous.
I'm just gonna pack this amy i think.
We've ever found oh god i'm just packing.
A little bit of canvas and a little bit.
Of flash stock onto my legs oh no what.
We even do now that was so bad look at.
My leg right now what do we even do yes.
Oh my god i don't even know what to do.
Music.
Oh where's the makeup way all right you.
Guys so we just landed here in vegas my.
Makeup is clearly not yet complete this.
Is probably the worst idea that i've.
Ever filmed i did not plan accordingly.
But i am gonna finish it and claim when.
You guys here come along for the journey.
We already started this might as well.
Finish with a bang so let's get off the.
Private jet and head into the next mode.
Of transportation to get some eating.

After that lovely conundrum we just had.
In the jet the private jet is fine we.
Cleaned it all up my pants however are.

I'm a little bit stiff but think i'll be.
Have like an hour before the meeting.
Actually starts we're on the way to get.

Bit more punch me and i'm going to use.

Right here.
It'll be right here okay so now it's.
Time to add a little bit of highlighter.
And for the highlighter today i'm for.
Once not going from using face from the.
Palette but instead i'm gonna be using a.
A brand new thing that just launched.
That is the dhokla cosmetics highlight.
Our palette and this one is the flash.
She just launched her holiday collection.
And i'm honestly very excited for it if.
We're being honest i feel like.
Highlighters are cliche at this point.
Like every single brand has a 50,000 of.
Them but watching jacqueline's video i.
Was honestly very excited to try it a.
Lot of it especially the illuminating.
Powder which i put in my setting powder.
Today it that spilled a little plain so.
Didn't even get to really try it out but.
I do have this palette it did not go.
Over the plain and that's it and see how.
It is i'm just gonna grab actually i'll.
Use like her just a little brush gonna.
Grab a little bit of a gleam on this.
Brush wait let me feel oh i feel so.
Buttery wow okay that's a beautiful.
Formula let's have a little bit of gleam.
On this brush and hold it on the chin.
That'll get on the brow bone area as.
Always oh wow there we go oh my gosh.
That is the lighting that i needed oh.
That looks gorgeous oh my god alright.
You guys so pretty much all i have left.
Of this makeup look it's going through.
The lips but since we woke up with the.
Ass crack of dawn i have not got a.
Chance to eat yet and we happen to be.
Right next door to my favorite.
Restaurant of literally all time not.
Sponsored but really wish it was the.
Pains literally daenerys keens to where.
I live in california is over an hour.
Away and my friends and i drive all the.
Time because it is literally that good.
So while we were here we're going to.
Indulge cuz some chicken tenders fries.
And texas toast or vegas toast this is.
Now a law instead of just a cheque or.
Anything so let's come along for the day.
All right.
Here's the goodies homework shaking.
Because i haven't eaten yet so whoop.
Aunt i'm just kidding but i did want to.
Tell you guys what i get it canes every.
Time i was to the three-finger combo.
Because you get three chicken tenders.
And fries and a piece of texas oats now.
This cans host is literally it's like.
Sweet and salty at the same time that's.
Alone this alone makes it just also the.
Box combo where you get four titers.
Instead of three and then you get.
Coleslaw but that's    disgusting i.
Feel like close all your people and then.
You do two pieces of toast instead of.
Music.
Okay you guys so the look is all.
Complete i this is my lips off camera.
After eating canes because it was quite.
The situation and now that the look is.
All gone gonna lock my face in place a.
Long time these know if it happens that.
Setting spray and then it's gonna use a.
Little bit of a mac fix+ and go bite to.
Really nice shining shimmering so we're.
Currently on the way to the actual mall.
