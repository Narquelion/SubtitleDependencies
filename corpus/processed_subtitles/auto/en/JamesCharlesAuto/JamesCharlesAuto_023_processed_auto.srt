Haven't already for more tutorials.
Coming soon hi guys i'm gonna be.
Starting off today using my benefit.
Porefessional primer i have a million.
Little bumps and pores all over my face.
So doing this would really help me.
Smooth everything out and get an even.
Foundation application next i'm going in.
With my la girl pro color corrector.
Concealer in orange just to color.
Correct my 5 o'clock shadow and my under.
Eye circles if you don't have this.
Problem obviously don't color cracked.
Because this is not pumpkin glam but if.
You're like me and you get negative 15.
Hours of sleep this might be for you i.
Also color corrected my acne spots using.
A green color corrector also from la.
Girl and then blended it out with my.
Beauty blender now i'm going in with my.
Make up for ever hd ultra foundation in.
The shade y 255 and just putting a bunch.
Of little dots all over my face.
Obviously we're gonna blend these out.
Later on but it just helps create a.
Really even application when you're.
Blending don't forget to blend on your.
Neck and on your ears too we want a.
Smooth transition and the last thing we.
Need is moses parting the foundation see.
On your face to highlight my face i'm.
Using my la girl pro concealer in the.
Shade porcelain i'm drawing little.
Triangles on my face in the middle of my.
Forehead into the middle of my chin on.
My mustache area and just one line down.
The center of my nose this will just.
Make all the high points of my face.
Stand out and then once again at.
Blending out with my beauty blender now.
I'm setting my entire face using kodi.
Ariston powder because i am done with.
The liquids and creams this will help to.
Set everything in place and to reduce.
Crease edge.
To further highlight my face i'm gonna.
Use my morphe 48 brush and this light.
Color for my lunatic cosmetics contour.
Lab this color usually comes in the.
Contour palette but i actually deep.
Potted it and just put it in my z.
Palette with all my other contour and.
Highlight shades once again i'm just.
Putting this on all the high points of.
My face to contour today i'm using my.
Morphe m-52 3 brush and my makeup geek.
Contour pans these colors are literally.
So good and they are so pigmented i'm.
Using the shade warm fair today just to.
Create a nice basic contour and i'm.
Going on my cheekbones my 5 head and on.
My jaw line to really carve everything.
Out and make my face look super defined.
Music.
Next to further define my contour i'm.
Using the same brush as before and.
Makeup heat cocoa bear it isn't.
Eyeshadow but i never use blush in my.
Look so this really helps to just warm.
Everything up next i'm just making my.
Face using my once again cody airspun.
Powder and my powder puff i'm just.
Drawing two really harsh defined lines.
From the tops of my ears to right above.
The corner of my mouth.
This will help really carve out that.
Contour and with whatever's left on the.
Powder puff i'm just gonna put.
Underneath my eyes and in the center of.
My forehead because i literally use so.
Much facial expression when i talk my.
Face creases so badly so doing this.
Helps decrease the creasing if that.
Makes any sense now to start the eyes i.
Did my brows off-camera just because i.
Tried and the angles turned out so bad i.
Promise i will do a prior tutorial later.
On but for now we're just gonna stick.
With this so to start off i'm using.
Makeup geek peach smoothie and my murphy.
And four-for-one brush just to get a.
Nice transition shade going in my crease.
For this entire look i use my morphe 35o.
Palette.
Since the shades don't have actual names.
I'll just be like describing them really.
All you need to know is that i used a.
Light and medium and a dark brown to.
Create the halo eye effect and then.
Obviously i'm going to be going into.
Blues and greens later on.
To further define that halo i i'm using.
My morphe m4 for one and once again just.
A medium brown tone from the 35k palette.
I'm putting that in the inner and outer.
Peace of the eyes and then just taking.
Whatever excess product is left and.
Going in windshield wipers just to.
Define that crease now i'm using my.
Morphe m 509 and a darker brown from the.
35 k just to further define the inner.
And outer v's and once again the crease.
Same thing just really keep darkening.
That halo eye and making sure there's a.
Nice even transition once i have nothing.
On that brush i'm just going in my lower.
And upper lash line just make sure.
Everything is super blended out now for.
The pop of color i'm spritzing my flat.
Definer brush with mac's fix+ and then.
Going into the makeup geek houdini i'm.
Just packing this all over the center of.
My lid and making sure to blend it up to.
My crease but not playing it up too far.
Because we don't want it to get muddy.
And gross looking next i'm going into.
The typhoon it's a makeup geek dual.
Chrome eyeshadow it's just green and.
Blue and i'm focusing that right on the.
Center of the lid and that's just with.
The tiny morphe definer brush i'm just.
Going back in with my m 509 and a dark.
Brown from the 35 k just to make sure.
That all the edges are super blown out.
And there's no harsh lines in the.
Waterline i'm just going in with the.
Italian deluxe eye pencil in turquoise i.
Got this at the morphe store if you.
Don't have this eye pencil you can.
Easily just do black it's really up to.
You but i wanted another pop of color on.
The bottom i actually lost the clip but.
I did use the nyx jumbo eye pencil in.
Black bean just to mimic the halo effect.
That we have going on on the upper lid.
And then once i did that i'm just going.
Back under the lower lash line to blend.
Everything out and connect it back up to.
The top i'm just going in now with my.
Favorite mascara benefit roller lash.
It's so good it makes my lashes look so.
Long and not clumpy so i would.
Definitely recommend i applied my.
Falsies off camera today i use the black.
Magic lashes in siren i ended up gluing.
My eye shot what i try to do on camera.
So definitely not going to do that again.
Anyway a lesson learned this is the.
Finished eye look sorry for the walk you.
Lash but i'm going to go ahead and do.
The other one off-camera and then we can.
Go ahead and finish the face together.
Two highly i'm just fetching my brush.
Again with mac's fix+ to make it super.
Defined and then mixing these two colors.
From my anasazi aglow cap now we packed.
Out highlight on like there's no.
Tomorrow remember the goal is that your.
Highlight can be seen from space and.
That you blind everybody walking by i.
Always highlight my cheekbones the tip.
Of my nose and my cupid's bow just.
Because i think it looks cute for my.
Lips today i'm using oprah brooklyn you.
Guys always ask what liquid lipsticks i.
Like best and they're definitely oprah.
The formulation is so good and they.
Don't dry crusty and gross like so many.
Other brands do as an optional last step.
I went ahead and i added houdini all.
Over my lips just for a cool joe chrome.
Effect and that guys is the finished.
Look i really hope you enjoyed this.
Tutorial and i will see you soon with a.
New video bye.
Music.
