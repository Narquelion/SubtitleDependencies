This right either like everyone every.
Photo i look at i'm like there's no way.
You were that way i wasn't that white i.
Was in boston doing a meet-and-greet and.
I took a picture with a bad her name was.
Pam i myself are on twitter today i can.
Say pam and she was a far darker skin.
That i was so when you take a photo with.
Contrasting skin tones automatically the.
Person with later skin tone is already.
Gonna look way lighter when you take it.
With flash because of like the light.
Balancing on the camera i don't know.
Really how it works and then she always.
Puts a filter on her photos that make.
Them even brighter so i did look like.
Kind of gray in the photo and i.
Definitely did have flashback but the.
Picture that went viral people.
Completely desaturate it it made me.
White so i was not that way but i was.
Definitely not looking at too hot it was.
Bad but not like that body right my side.
Looks better already.
You guys hit me credit here okay she's.
Way better at makeup than me at.
Foundation latoya so stop laying.
Foundation you know i was watching your.
Videos i sound like a fan why i kind of.
Am i'll stick to my own service you.
Don't you don't pull it out all the way.
Anymore oh wow that was like a recent.
Video that i have to hide cuz i watch.

Keep up with me it's always really cool.
To me when i like people that i actually.
Consider like close friends yeah talk to.
You about my videos because like we're.
Busy yeah we're crazy busy like today so.
Far i've already had three meetings this.
Morning i had to go show my coachella.

I took a shower how to shave my entire.
Body to get ready for coachella and i.
Had a fitting tonight too that i already.

Well sister kenzie is speaking of.
Youtube you miss the girly thing or in a.
New youtube show i am tall spotted.

Bullied all.
So it's pretty sad it's pretty in the.
Show yeah i know yeah it's really fun.
Filming well you obviously started and.
Dancing but do you really like acting.
Now - yeah i think my like main thing.
That i want to do is singing right now.
But well she's a musician she is we need.
To do a singer makeup routine featuring.
In kenzie.
Yeah it's that'd be so much fun i can.
Feature on it too you know music - i.
Went into an audition the other day and.
They made me sing happy birthday and.
Then i was like really embarrassed and.
They're like you have a great voice can.
You sing it for us.
Yeah right i don't know how to be we're.
Just gonna um what do you mean you don't.
Know how to bake i remember we went.
Through this on when i did your makeup i.
Really don't know how to do it i'm just.
Scared for the nose snatch well i think.
You have to faith faith trust in a.
Little bit of powdered us um you see i.
Don't really know how to do this okay.
Yeah i'm not gonna help you because i.
Feel like you know we're at it we're in.
A competition.
Yeah i want to win we used to compete.
Against each other our whole lives so.
It's actually really nice to not have to.
Compete against one another anymore cuz.
Like i took more of the acting yeah.
She's taking more those are you doing.
Acting.
Oh yeah but you know what i mean like if.
We go yeah i totally good cuz i have.
This singing and he was like you you're.
More dancer though my favorite moment of.
The show that shall not be named yeah.
When kenzie finally was in the same.
Column i know what you're gonna say age.
Category thank you when has he's finally.
The same age category and you guys.
Battled against each other.
I lived everyone was like making like.
The biggest deal like i was mad and i.
Wasn't oh well you literally were like.
The queen like everybody knew baddies.
There was no right that's why it was a.
Big deal that's why i was a huge girl.
I have voice but like a huge fan of you.
But i was like wow i was like i was like.
A proud like no way mm oh man it was.
Awesome it was good because like you.
Know everyone always used to compare us.
Have you guys always been ridiculously.
Competitive oh no me i mean i didn't.
Really care as much because i i didn't.
Really like to.
As much when i was younger yeah i didn't.
Really want to do it because it was so.
Much pressure.
Yeah like everyone was screaming at me.
And i wasn't even in any that a group.
Dances like in the first 16 so i was.
Like i don't know why i'm here voodoo is.
About doing everything i do okay now i'm.
Gonna take some blush a tea - tea why i.
Probably wear believe yeah i fix this i.
Think you just keep going wow.
I only did one side of the nose so you.
Have to do the other side no dip sri.
Lanka probably now right now it's the.
Hot do you think you can come up with a.
Song for contouring my nose right now.
That's for next time that's our daughter.
Sister colossal sister yeah you guys.
Should have your own because we had ours.
We had our own sand that we need a.
Sister jo yeah you're not you're not.
Invited.
Well i just volunteered as tribute so.
We're milo hunger games honey where you.
Said babe kenzie what are you doing i.
Don't know what i'm doing whatsoever and.
I'm we don't know it's not gender sister.
It's funny cuz i can say it to you like.
My sister there was a video of you it.
Says james charles knowing maddie.
Ziegler for one minute straight and i.
Was like i don't know how they got that.
Because you did not annoy me one bit.
Yeah i'll just catch you i like the word.
Says the worst they really get you guys.
I think they're funny but i think what.
Sucks is that the comment section that.
Always gets horrible and then it turns.
From a joke video to a really serious.
Thing actually hey situation which is.
Never fun and is completely unnecessary.
Right i was luck serious like i.
Obviously had a lot of work into the.
Content i create and like i'm very very.
Blessed to have an active group of.
Followers or i don't like need to social.
Time off anybody to have anybody to like.
Be successful you know so like i pick.
And choose who i want on my channel and.
I usually pay people that i'm really.
Close with like me and maddie said in.
Our original video like we've been close.
Friends for a long time we still are.
Every time somebody comes i was like wow.
They're just using each other for.
Fallers and it's like first of all it's.
Our job and obviously of course it's a.
Collaborative effort do you think we'd.
Want to be sitting here something in.
Front of a camera if i didn't like i.
Would we wouldn't know nobody would.
Filming beauty video is just an fyi to.
You guys out there really suck sometimes.
Just i got five to six hour process and.
It's like really really hot and.
Lengthy it's tiring you just want to.
Stretch your back in it let me go to the.
Chiropractor by the end of it you're.
Dirty like you just want to wipe.
Everything off obviously it's fun and i.
Love my job but trust me when i say like.
If somebody didn't want to do this we.
Would not be here trust me on that.
Yeah when you didn't mind make of it it.
Was like three hours it was a long time.
Yeah but like when you see the video.
It's like yeah.
A lot goes into it my house it seems.
That nobody really sees and knows about.
I mean i love that at the end of the day.
Obviously would not be here like if i.
Didn't enjoy it but it just sucks that.
People always wanna look at the negative.
For everything but it's kind of funny.

Burn buddy thanks dude do you eat when.
People say that the only show i hate is.

About this is that maddy will literally.
Like rub on her foundation with like.
Three fingers and then like put on like.
Some brow gel and call it a day but.
She's like know so much about makeup and.
Kenzie's that be like a full glam type.
Of girl and it has no idea yeah maddy.
Have you been watching drag race this.
Season we talked about okay who's your.
Favorites right now i'm really loving.
Miss crock i have a personal bias.
Towards our query because i am friends.
With her and i heard dragons it's.
Sickening we need the best what miss.
Crocker i'm looking she is so funny yes.
Her comedic timing is amazing i also.
Love a player st. claire she is a real.
Woman really little man he's good i.
Think she's maybe not shining as bright.
As she can but she's still doing really.
Well.
She literally looks like like an angel.
Yes like she looks like she's like oh i.
Said it out of heaven look into the.
Driveway okay i want to do liner but i'm.
Gonna do this no we both do it i'm most.
Excited for beyonce i think that's like.
The most typical thing to say but she.
Just is so talented she's making her.
Comeback.
Ah you know i am so excited i also.
Really said her to see cardi b i did go.
To go to la she for the first time it.
Was really really fine but you guys know.
That i don't like drink or smoke or.
Anything and that's kind of like really.
What yeah the bible coaching a lot early.
It's a little bit overwhelming not gonna.
Lie but so this year i'm really just.
Gonna try to focus on the music and the.
Instagram photos i am serving looks all.
You sisters watching it you guys are.
Going to get a full on coachella.
Tutorial and lookbook and i think the.
Next thing that goes up after this one.
Peoples waves are about to be flying off.
Okay that when delimiting wig on my.
Account and i'm just like my favorite.
Thing about that ever was when kim.
Kardashian posted a selfie with her new.
Blonde tara everyone was like wow wig.
And then she tweeted it was like you.
Guys it's not a wig on i love her that.
Was the funniest thing that's holy.
Okay i'm gonna like go underneath it's.
So funny because you know she's known.
For being like a social media like.
Queens but like but she's also a mom and.
Like she's like okay i think i'm just.
Okay.
Literally there's two sides they're both.
Black and i just don't get it at all.
Look at that one's longer i want to do.
Like a blue under your eye but if not.
That's so like i can draw like a little.
Heart on your gee that's a tiny one like.
Right there oh.
Yeah i'm doing it alright okay so what's.
Your favorite video you've ever built.
That's actually a really really tough.
One.
I'd probably have to say either my.
Three-part series of the en or probably.
A blank canvas just because they usually.
On a club i was really proud of it cause.
It was really awesome to look back on.
Everything that i've done in the past.
Year because like it has been an.
Emotional roller coaster with bullying.
Really highs and also really lows like.
Even like while editing that like a.
Little remember i was like snapchatting.
I was sobbing crying it was so.
Embarrassing but i was also just like a.
Really vulnerable moment for me just.
Like i just put a lot of heart and soul.
Into a lot so i think that's definitely.
Like one of my all-time favorites and i.
Think it will probably forever be oh.
Yeah never in a million years would have.
Ever thought i'd like be here right so.
Weird we never thought we'd like be on a.
Reality show and then now we're here you.
Know a statement suck you really never.
Know what i thought that's gonna happen.
Then it just kind of does and you're.
Like wow i had no clue was going on when.
I was like six yeah ladies were.
Following me around and i was like yeah.
Sometimes i feel like we didn't really.
Have a childhood you know like we've.
Never been like a proper one there was.
Just cameras on us like all the time a.
Lot of people think that like being.
Famous really having a following itself.
Is all fun and games but it really is.
There's like a big dark side to it that.
Not a lot of people get to see a lot of.
People don't think about just because.
They think like oh you're on tv you're.
Making money you would relate these cool.
Things but in reality like there's a.
Really huge lack of privacy there and.
Obviously we get to kind of pick and.
Choose now what we decide to share with.
People but at the same time like it's.
Sometimes really hard for people to.
Respect those boundaries and really know.
Like when to kind of leave you alone or.
When to kind of like ah let you do your.
Own thing and it's sometimes hard to say.
Only can't make this joker i can't say.
This or talk about this or be seen with.
This person or go to this restaurant or.
Do this activity because it might come.
Off to the general public in this sort.
Of way it's like it's just really.
Strange to have to like constantly be.
Thinking about that at all times they.
Can do anything you're not having to.
Think twice about a situation yeah.
But we're like wait if we do this are we.
Gonna get like no it definitely is the.
Choice that we chose to live at this.
Point i'm really thankful for honesty.
Like it's like a battle that i'm willing.
To fight every day but it is really.
Crazy.
Something that people really don't think.
About ever okay be honest i know you're.
Like competing too but like does it.
Really look bad it's like you never.
Finished the other it's like we're just.
Like stop it and you just don't connect.
The lines the heart was also really my.
Dear the minute i was watching dance.
Moms and you were at like age seven.
Walking out with the foulest glam ever.
With like yellow glitter on there i.
Would why i loved it every time it was.

Face while she was sleeping that's a.
Truce yeah and then waking up with.
Eyelashes on and everything okay middle.
Of my eyelid i find the one doing all.
The people's makeup a long set of.
Mascara and lashes the hardest thing.
Doing there was always lips.
I feel like lips are very very specific.
Thing that can go so wrong.
We're just like the slightest change of.
Shape at the slightest like over liner i.
Don't know why yeah it's the worst i can.
Do myself educator yeah shame on.
