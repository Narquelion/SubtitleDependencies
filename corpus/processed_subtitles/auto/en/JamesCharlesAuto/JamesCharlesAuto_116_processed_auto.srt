The tarte tape tape concealer and also.
The maybelline fit me concealer and i.
Also have my setting powders here as.
Well then i'm gonna have you guys vote.

Powder okay what concealer should i wear.
And then what should i set my face let's.
Give those polls on 5 minutes and see.
What you guys have to say so after a few.
Minutes it looks like the tarte a shape.
Tape concealer is a winning so far and.
Then for setting powder it looks like.
The allure mercier one with a 40% which.
Is only one percent higher than the.
Sweet peach whoo.
So looks like our tart shave tape is the.
Clear winner here with a forty to a.
Percent boat so we're gonna go ahead and.
Apply that today i'm just gonna apply.
This in a triangle right below my eyes.
On the sides of my nose really highlight.
The center of my face then are just.
Gonna bounce it in with my damp beauty.
Blender having a good skin day so now.
The concealer is all on we are.
Highlighted we're gonna go ahead and set.
That in place using laura mercier.
Translucent setting powder which is so.
Anyway at 41% wow so far you guys are.
Literally picking my everyday makeup.
Routine it definitely is really really.
Cool that you guys know my makeup.
Products that i love and stand by that.
Well here's the best gonna got my damp.
Beauty blender and pop this right.
Underneath the eyes.
Our face is offset in place but we need.
To add a little bit more dimension.
Because we're looking a little bit flat.
Stanley like so i'm gonna choose between.
Some contours what should i contour my.
Face way that today question mark we.
Have the usual very busted crusted.
Dusted busted rusted kat von d shade and.
Light palette we have the anasazi.
Beverly hills contour kit we have the.
Next holiday and contouring palette and.
Lastly we have the new morphia bron.
Tours which are bronzer and contour duos.
What blush should i wear today i'm gonna.
Make option number one no blush for a.
Very bronzy type of look option number.
Two will be mac peaches which is my.
Usual go-to peaches is a very orange.
Tones i'm also gonna do it mac dolly mix.
Which is a bright bright pink shade and.
Then finally edge away a blush and.
Highlighting do it in the shade kiss me.
Oh my god.
Oh wow okay so so far the contouring.
Pole literally is almost tied with.
Everything it's at 24 23 26 and 27.
Percent let's see which one pulls ahead.
So after eight thousand votes the kat.
Von d shade and light palette is winning.
With 29 percent and the mac peaches.
Blush is winning at forty two percent.
Which is all by normal products that he.
Used in an everyday makeup routine so.
What i'm thinking i love you guys i.
Appreciate so much the fact that you.
Know what all my products are like.
That's honestly so so dope.
But let's put a twist on this i want the.
City to be interesting so from this.
Point on i'm gonna be picking all the.
Least voted items from the poll to keep.
This good and fresh so new products are.
Being used so to contour my face i'm.
Going to use the oddest asya contouring.
Kit which has a 23% and then mac oh god.
Dolly max i just definitely screwed.
Myself over which has 11% oh i regret.
This i'm gonna grab this middle shade.
Right here in the palette it is the most.
Cool tone shade and i'm gonna use that.
To start chiseling.
Out my cheekbones oh that colors pretty.
Oh my god hello oh we love her she's.
Good definitely cannot forget to chisel.
Out.
Five heads a little bit of work i'm.
Gonna lightly chisel out mine oh that's.
Not lightly okay well miss anasazi huh.
She's a pigmented sister i'm guess i'm.
Not going to blend this out very happily.
I'm just gonna pawn this latest that up.
The dolly books blush that's enough.
That's enough i can work with that.
It's for the video it's for the video.
It's for the video all right so long my.
Face is baking in the oven we're gonna.
Move on to the eyebrows and you guys.
Know i definitely always use a brow.
Pencil all the time so i'm a little bit.
Scared because i haven't feel like if.
This is continuing to go how it's been.
Going that this is gonna win and that.
Means that another option we're gonna.
Have to use but regardless let's go.
Ahead and create the pole so today's.
Options are going to be the benefit.
Precisely a brow pencil the iconic.
London liquid a brow cushion benefit of.
Foolproof brow powder which i literally.
I don't think i've ever actually used in.
My entire life and then the oddest asya.
Dip brow pomade so we're a few minutes.
Into the pool and as of right now the.
Anasazi dip brow is currently winning at.
39% it is at a hot minute since i've.
Used this baby and as you can see she's.
Basically a pretty much empty this was.
Like the number one recipe item for.
Getting the james charles block brick.
Lego sharpie eyebrow a year or two ago.
So i'm spooked mcgoofy.
To use this today but you know what.
We're gonna do it oh wait.
That's the winning item no we obviously.
Use the brow powder no ah okay just.
Kidding i literally already forgot that.
I'm switching things up so the one who.
Is pulling the least sorry sweetie is.
The benefit foolproof brow powder i.
Don't think i've ever once done my.
Eyebrows with powder i really don't.
Enjoy it i feel like that would just.
Look weird but you know what we're gonna.
Make this work so i'm gonna grab this.
Powder and an angle brush and try to.
Slay this these brows may take me a hot.
Second to get a snatch and on fleek i'm.
A little bit scared so while i'm doing.
My brows i'm actually gonna post the.
Poll for my eyeshadow palettes see your.
Sisters have plenty of time to vote.
We're gonna choose between the jocelyn.
Hill palette from morphe the bh.
Cosmetics take me back to at brazell.
Palette the anasazi beverly hills soft.
Glam eyeshadow palette.
And the brand-new kkw ex mario den.
Ivanovitch huh as well alright the poll.
Is up now let's try to slay these brows.
I think i may have a slight advantage.
Here being that i definitely do already.
Have a lot of brow hair so this is kind.
Of just like filling in and shaping up.
But i literally cannot imagine trying to.
Use a brow powder first of all that.
Doesn't have a lot of eyebrow hairs like.
Hello i use a brow pencil or a pommy.
Because i feel like it adds a lot of.
Pigmentation and it really allows to.
Shape the brow whereas like powder like.
Hello what is it even doing where is she.
I feel like brow powder is definitely.
For like the type of person that wears.
Makeup every day but doesn't want to.
Look like they're wearing makeup.
Everyday boring cannot relate but i.
Think that's why i'm having so much.
Trouble with this because it's like.
Literally not showing up that i'm used.
To like brick block lego sharpie eyebrow.
Moment but that's what i'm known for and.
That's what i really really love i've.
Gotten to a point with my brows now.
Where i actually i'm really happy with.
The shape and the amount of hair that i.
Have i can usually do them with a brow.
Pencil in less than time that it's at.
This point both eyebrows just took me 34.
Minutes and they still look that i don't.
Think i will ever ever do that again.
Once both rows are filled then i'm going.
To use as my normal concealer that we.
Got from before and a flat top brush.
Just to clean up underneath and then use.
That concealer as an eyeshadow primer or.
Wherever look we decide to do wow i.
Literally don't even know where to put.
This concealer to define the brow.
Because i can't even see where the.
Eyebrow is in the first place let's move.
On to eyeshadow so the pole has been up.
For 20 minutes now and after 15,000.
Votes the jaclyn hill paula is number.
One with 35% jacqueline lover girl but.
That pile has been used on the channel.
Way too many times so at this point i'm.
Kind of glad we're doing this twist and.
A bh soft lamb is our loser today with.
16% of both but she's not loser in my.
Heart because we're gonna use this.
Palette to create some type of look and.
Now i'm gonna run a poll to see it what.
Style of eyeshadow we should use let's.
See what type of eyeshadow look should i.
Do question mark.
Let's do cut crease let's see choice.
Number two could be half cut crease.
Choice umber three smokey eye choice.
Ever poker beat halo.
Let's see what the sisters have to say.
Okay i clearly play myself because i.
Wanted to switch up but you sisters are.
Way too smart and you caught on to the.
Fact that the everyday stuff was winning.
So i'm gonna reverse reverse.
And go back to figure you number one.
Option because i never do halo eyes so.
I'm gonna put on a halo eye because 40%.
Of people want a helo eye this is a mess.
But let's be real what james charles.
Video isn't a mess i'm gonna start off.
Our car be in the shade oranges soda and.
Using that as my transition and popping.
That right in my crease so everything.
Blends nicely together i'm just gonna.
Use circular windshield wiper motions as.
Usual but i'm keeping the shadow.
Actually more a rounded shape but you.
Guys know i love a good winged out.
Shadow moment that really lifts up the.
Eyes but for a sister halo eye i.
Definitely want to keep it more round.
And really accentuate the circular halo.
Shape next to the morphe m4 33 i'm gonna.
Grab the shade of burnt orange and i'm.
Gonna pop that right in the crease once.
Again making sure to keep the eye shape.
Really really circular and large we love.
A blended sister okay next is the more.
Defined blending brush i'm gonna dip.
Into the shade it's janna right up in.
Here and use this to it define out the.
Crease a little bit more and then.
Finally using a really tiny a tapered.
Blending brush whoo that's a mouthful.
I'm going to dip into the shades.
Mulberry and a little bit of cypress.
Number and just really deepen up the.
Crease one last time i feel like it's.
Been a hot minute since i've done like a.
Darker smoky type of look i think i've.
Been doing it that's why it looks a lot.
Recently so holding this video let's.
Switch it up a little bit make her dark.
Make her a little bit spooky why not.
This outer corner still is looking at.
Walki though why don't it's not blend.
Out it is clearly been a hot minute.
Since i've done a halo eye because i.
Cannot figure out how to blend this.
Outer edge to save my life points let's.
Play on hello so now that we have the.
Crease i'll blend it out and define i.
Want to make this into an actual halo.
Eye so i'm gonna grab my morphe m42 one.
Brush and a little bit of my concealer.
From before and i guess cut the crease.
Those muscles of your cut crease but.
Just in the center portion so we can.
Build out that halo to do the actual.
Heal the way i'm going to do the same.
Exact colors that i used in the crease.
And the same order as well popping them.
Right on top of the concealer and i'm.
Gonna start off with the shade orange.
Soda and pop that right in the center.
But i am gonna leave a little bit of a.
Strip in but.
You know for a shimmer shadow in a.
Second i'm just packing the shade on.
There making sure to get right up to.
That line of concealer so we get that.
Cut halo i type of love i'm gonna grab.
The shade see jana and pop that right.
Next door next we're gonna use cypress.
Ember on a fluffy pencil brush and pop.
This on the inner corner as well as the.
Outer corner next to the small concealer.
Brush like this one this is the morphe.
At 19 i'm gonna dip into the shade or.
Right up here called a bronze and i'm.
Gonna give my brush a good spread of mac.
Fix+ so it's very very pigmented and.
Metallic and i'm gonna pop that right in.
The center of that little halo so the.
Upper lip portion of the shadow is.
Finally donna thank god i was not too.
Confident this at first but i'm really.
Liking the direction that's going now so.
Let's talk liner do we want to do it we.
Don't want to do it let's ask the.
Sisters gonna put choice one no eyeliner.
Choice number two winged blocked liner.
Choice number three glitter liner for.
This portion and choice number four.
Would be black and glitter liner let's.
See so once this pulls done am i picking.
The most voted option now or the least.
Voted option now this would be a fast i.
Know what i'm doing oh while i'm waiting.
For the results to come in on the liner.
Paul i'm gonna quickly go ahead and do.
The eye shadow off-camera on the other.
All right i'll be right back to finish.
Off the look so we are back and both.
Eyes are currently done and a slave and.
As even as i could possibly get them i.
Always hate doing a halo eyes or eye.
Shapes like this because my eyes are.
Very very uneven and always is a little.
Bit wonky but you know what i'm happy.
With where we're at the polls are.
Running for 20 minutes now and at low.
State the results are black and glitter.
Liner is waiting by 40% let's do it i'm.
Gonna use the urban decay midnight.
Cowboy glitter liner and first pop that.
On the center of the lid to really make.
That halo eye pop and then i'm also.
Gonna trace out a really thin line right.
At the top of that halo to cut the halo.
Crease might as well go all out and be a.
Little bit extra at this point i'm gonna.
Throw in a black winged liner as well.
Using the nyx matte liquid liner you.
Guys did before a glitter liner too so.
Not only am i gonna put it on the lid.
But let's be a little bit extra today i.
Want to do a double glitter winged liner.
I may be regarding that but you know.
What go big or go home.
I forgot how hard this wants to do oh my.
God okay she's on there.
Oh that was a lot i don't even know if i.
Like this anymore.
Whatever too late now oh my god had to.
Throw in the other i know what okay.
Honestly it has been a very very very.
Long time since i have finished my.
Makeup and looked in the mirror and not.
Been happy with the result but for some.
Reason i absolutely hate how this is.
Turning out i don't know why but you.
Know what we're just gonna keep trucking.
Through hopefully it'll come together in.
The end but next up is going to be the.
Eyelashes and at this point go big go.
Home so today we were choosing between.
Lily lashes in the style mikonos house.
Elijah is ikonics lily lashes and the.
Style miami's and a good and fresh 301.
Laughter.
You're kidding the poles been going for.
10 minutes now and unfortunately my.
Sister 301 did not win we're gonna pump.
On a pair of the lily lashes miami's.
Today i thought i'd wear these all the.
Time are you guys i love that you know.
My makeup routine so well but this video.
I had never wanted a video to be over.
With more in my entire life i don't know.
What its way on right now let me hear.
That i just accidentally cut off half.
The eyelash you know how i said earlier.
That lashes could potentially save this.
Look i lied i still don't love it but i.
Will say that it does look significantly.
Better and less like horrible with a.
Pair of lashes on and although it's not.
My favorite look that i've ever done i.
Will say that it does kind of look.
Relatively pretty relatively okay and.
Maybe can be fixed with a little bit of.
Sister phase tuned.
So i'm trying to stay positive i'm kind.
Of stay motivated because i want to.
Finish this video and i'm honestly.
Having a lot of fun doing this so now.
That the eyes are all complete let's.
Move on to the rest of the face starting.
Off with highlighter.
We're gonna choose between for today.
Starting off with mary lou manizer from.
The balm the anasazi beverly hills exxon.
Resi collab anasazi beverly hills so.
Hollywood might go to or the jeffree.
Star cosmetics 24-karat highlighting.
Palettes the results are in and by an.
Overwhelming majority the jeffree star.
Skin frost palette won with 55% of the.
Boat who i'm going to.
Myself a good spread of mac fix+ because.
I've been having a lot of powder on my.
Face and i'm gonna dip into the shade.
Sarcophagus in this palette and get my.
Glow on oh you're kidding me.
I know geoffrey does not play around.
When it comes to his makeup and.
Pigmentation but that is probably the.
Brightest highlighter i've ever seen in.
My entire life like what the hack i was.
Going for a more soft and subtle look.
Today by i guess this is gonna have to.
Do i'm gonna mix a little bit of the.
Shade king tut in with the sarcophagus.
For the next cheek so it's not like.
Overwhelming wow that's insane a whole.
I'm gonna pop a little bit of this right.
Above my brow bones as well you guys.
Know i love having up here to widen out.
My face a little bit and just bring more.
Attention to this region i feel like it.
Gives a really really natural and.
Beautiful like glow from within take a.
Look even though this palette is not.
Exactly a glow from within type of the.
Highlighter clearly also how would you.
Guys feel about a sister james and.
Geoffrey collab i feel like that would.
Low-key be kind of iconic let me know.
I'm actually gonna skip out on.
Highlighting the inner corners today.
Because i really want to keep the focus.
On the halo eye right in the center of.
The eyes and not like in the corners of.
The eyes if that makes sense.
But i am gonna grab a little bit more of.
A sarcophagus mixed with king tut tap.
The excess off the brush then i'm going.
To use this to highlight right down the.
Tip of my nose oh what from this angle.
This look looks really pretty actually.
Okay maybe this isn't the worst only.
From this angle though hmm and last but.
Certainly not least thank you lord if we.
Have the liberty to us and for this at.
Once again we have four options starting.
Off with a glossy nude a kind of a brown.
A cool tone gray lip a red or a pop of.
Color and i didn't pick out a color for.
Pop of color if that one went i'll host.
A separate poll again letting everybody.
Else pick a pop of color let's do it you.
Guys want the results are in in our last.
Poll as.
A glossy nude honestly not surprised and.
It won with 36% out of 10,000 votes in.
Only nine minutes you guys literally yes.
Laid this challenge i feel like a purple.
Or a blue or a green what i've looked.
Literally so bad at this look and i feel.
Like at least a glossy nude will kind of.
Tie everything together even though i.
Still hate bass you guys.
It is currently 436 here in california i.
30 this.
Morning it has been five hours now this.
Has been a crazy wild ride we had a lot.
Of ups and downs.
A few emotional breakdowns on the way.
But we are finally done with the.
Completed look completely chosen by you.
Guys even though i'm not obsessed with.
The finished look today i think that.
Having you guys pick my makeup routine.
And products is one of the most fun.
Things i've ever done and i really.
Really really love this challenge i.
Forgot to say this was slowing the outro.
Earlier sorry guys i was very very.
Focused on finishing the video and.
Getting my makeup off my face but thank.
You so much everybody who participated.
In that like seriously oh my god it.
Means so much to me that literally.
Thousands of you guys we're sitting and.
Literally waiting for me for five hours.
So i found that video to vote on those.
Polls and to pick which products i would.
Put my face like that is really really.
So cool and just goes to show how.
Amazing you guys are and obviously we.
Did it do a little flip flop and i was.
Making fun of the fact that all my.
Everyday makeup products were being.
Picked but that just shows that you guys.
That really do care about my videos and.
That you pay attention to the products.
That i'm using and that i'm loving so.
