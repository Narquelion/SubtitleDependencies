Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back 22 channel okay you guys i.
Am so beyond excited for today's brand.
New video as you can see we are not in.
The normal youtube studio setting i am.
Outside in front of my garage because.
For today's video in case you did not.
Know i recently bought a car for my.
First time ever here in los angeles i.
Have been driving for the past few weeks.
And is pretty fun and good and fresh so.
Far i have not died yet.
Which is surprising to me and i'm really.
Happy about that.
Aside from the car there's been a lot of.
Other amazing things going on and if you.
Guys did not know we recently just had.
10 million sisters here on this youtube.
Channel there are so many new sisters.
Here in the family and i apparently have.
Not done a q&a video in literally over a.
Year now i don't know how that happened.
But for today i thought i'd be so much.
Fun to show you guys my brand new car.
Hop in the tesla and go for a little bit.
Of a ride while talking about all things.
In my life.
Boys drama makeup my palette and a whole.
Lot more so without further ado let's go.
Dry with me i don't we not die.
Music.
Ready for a got a trivial yeah so slow.
This is the brand-new 2018 a tesla model.
X set seven people for myself and all my.
Family whenever we are whipping it.
Around here in california together the.
Car can block would actually just got it.
Painted my sticker city here in.
California there and literally the bus.
And the entire will be finished this so.
Quickly and it looks literally.
Incredible just got new black rims thank.
God because they were very very.
Prescient and gross before and i.
Literally and love with this car you.
Guys i don't want to get the windows.
Tinted for a little bit more privacy but.
I thought we should be better driving.
Before i do that and then i died so.
Without further ado the sun is going.
Down which is so incredibly rude at.
Daylight savings time it just happens we.
Only have a little bit of suddenly left.
First and i sound let's help any go for.
A ride all right so three seconds and we.
Weren't recording but we just missed a.
Stop sign so it's off to a really good.
Start by the way my best friend drew was.
Behind the camera the questions that i.
Just so you know you can ask yourself.
The question so that is very true oh i.
Thought it'd be fun tuned for a cute i.
Actually did not pick out these.
Questions for today's video i asked you.
Guys to tweet me on twitter by the way.
If you don't follow me on twitter.
Probably should actually ask drew to go.
Out there and pick out the most like.
Liked questions that you guys all want.
On house little kind of like a sister.
Surprise.
The class excuse me ma'am i'm gonna need.
You to wait your turn.
Thank you very much as you'll notice we.
Have gopros on the windshield and druce.
Only i refuse to text and drive use my.
Phone while driving to do anything while.
Driving i think it is so stupid so don't.
Do that please.
Literally everett and the first question.
Is from emily are you ever going to be.
Getting a dog if so what would you name.
It love you sister.
Definitely okay so now that i have a.
House which is literally the best thing.
In the entire movement they were unable.
To come over all the time in my manager.
And assistant work out of the house.
Every single day and obviously sister.
Ian listen me now too which is a pizza.
Bass so it's always a full house i've.
Always wanted a dog since i moved to.
California but i never wanted to get a.
Dollar when i was living downtown.
Because i was not home not often and it.
Was only me so as such as i loved a dog.
Literally like animal cruelty to leave a.
Dog in that girl's apartment all day.
Long and not be able to walk in in.
Downtown so now absolutely i'm doing a.
Lot of traveling in the next few months.
But as soon as everything settles down i.
Will definitely be a top date and i am.
So got excited as for the name i'm going.
To see the dog first away yeah leave.
Comments below with me mate yes oh yeah.
Definitely.
I really want to get something with a.
Husky matt it's like really really badly.
Consenting huskies are the cutest butt.
Both grayson and my dad and a lot of.
Other my close friends are really really.
Allergic to dogs so i think i need to.
Get a hypoallergenic one so if you have.
Any really great breed suggestions let.
Kitty go now here we're gonna use our.
Phone on one side since the camera.
Literally already died one seconds of.
The videos you love how good at.
Youtubing i am honestly like never use a.
Vlog camera though no because all my.
Videos are in a professional studio yeah.
Good time okay next question is from.
Audrey how what is your favorite beauty.
Guru palette other than your own there.
Are a lot of really really good ones one.
Of my favorite you can't makeup artist a.
See marie i'm you i actually just.
Collaborated with i think be perfect.
Created a beautiful rainbow palette so.
Other than mine i would have to say hers.
Basically because it's a very similar.
Drive hello where are you going we are.
Going to die a hundred percent hopefully.
Just be perfect to implement a question.
Vegas driving pet peeve by becca let me.
Tell you okay people in california suck.
At driving including me but everyone is.
So okay so first of all biggest thing.
Nobody uses their turn signals you're.
Not a single person so you have.
Literally no idea what anybody's going.
To move relocate themselves speed up.
Slow down or get off an accent so i've.
Already witnessed like eighty six car.
Crashes almost happened and like the.
Front of my eyes like several as much.
I've always been apart from people not.
Putting on their signal it's like is it.
Really that hard to answer your question.
No it's not watch ready watch that's.
Ready right click it okay look at.
Everybody who's behind me which is.
Nobody but if they were behind me.
They're gonna know that i'm currently.
Making a right-hand turn so that's a.
Major issue that i have really been.
Finding difficult also like i'm a pretty.
Fast driver i'm very impatient i have.
Places to go things to see money to make.
People to talk and if the speed limit is.
35 i'm going at least 40 okay i did not.
Want to be going down a road that is 35.
And i think at 32 miles per hour.
Why the speed limit is a suggestion not.
11 and okay the next question is from.
Two obsessed with conan and it says what.
Was the most difficult makeup look for.
You to make or recreate i'm not really.
Sure off the top of my head probably.
Honestly the hardest talk about of so.
Much of the velocity videos but putting.
Like the white in the right areas and.
Trying to make it actually look like the.
Foundation was painted on top of the.
White canvas for some reason was very.
Very challenging on the day of the shoot.
But i love how edna turning out.
You know i think we need to do both yeah.
Yeah we already want to go to the.
Mcdonald's yep i think it's pretty close.
To you so i'll just whip it over there.
Forever like someone's gonna crash into.
Forums okay hello hi can i do.
A 10-piece chicken nuggets i'm at a.
Large fry are sleek we do 20 nuggets and.
Two large fries on lots of barbeque.
Songs please and and also buffalo a.
Large coke at a large sprite oh yes we.
Make chicken she said now we have to.
Whip it around this curb.
This is such a big vehicle and such a.
Small driver like for why i'm the queen.
Of driving oh my gosh okay this is a.
Funny one i found.
So johanna asks just curious did you.
Ever have a girlfriend yeah i had two.
Girlfriends actually when i was in.
Middle school her son's name was tasked.
And the other one's name was katie and.
They were both best friends.
For like three days total both until you.
Realize that you liked male features.
Yeah this is a casual one honey nass.
What's your favorite pop tart flavor.
S'mores or brown sugar cinnamon for sure.
Like it's a tie between the tail yeah.
This one's you always have yeah curves.
Aren't straight and neither am i asks i.
Mean that's proving any tips for being.
More comfortable as yourself tea.
Honestly i like really really bad when.
It comes to advice on those type of.
Questions because of the fact that like.
Oh good hurry oh let's video is not.
Sponsored but i should be so the.
Tunnel's please to be completely honest.
I am really really bad at adviced.
Questions when it comes to me being.
Myself and being more confident because.
The fact that i have become who i am.
Through dealing with bullying and.
Dealing with a lot of things working.
Against me my entire life i've always.
Just had a very very thick skin and have.
Been very very unapologetic and i think.
For me you guys really know this but i'm.
Definitely a like self-proclaimed.
Workaholic doing the job that i do every.
Single day and working as much as i do.
It does happen on the occasion but i.
Actually like taking time to get.
Offended over stop until i let that.
Stuff get to me for me personally i find.
Very very challenging because it's not.
Giving literally just so busy i guess my.
Biggest piece of advice is like you are.
You and you were born that way and.
You're in literally the best in the.
Entire world and we all have our talents.
And everybody has their flaws - its.
Abroad to really focus on like what.
Makes you happy what makes you feel.
Confident so that you're not like.
Hopefully focusing on the negative.
Because it can turn into a really really.
Bad.
And once you get stuck in that it's.
Really hard to come out of it that was.
Like a really crappy entire month and.
Surround yourself with good people and.
So on.
Oh yeah that's a really good thing to.
Like sir i understand with really good.
People who have similar work ethics and.
Morals like when i first moved to la and.
I became like a social-media influencer.
I tried really hard to fit in with like.
Everybody and i was hanging out with.
Everybody and i was pointing to parties.
It was a really really toxic mindset for.
Me to always want a fan and always go to.
Those house parties and be at those.
Events and stuff once i really stopped.
Trying and mostly because i was working.
All the time and couldn't even have time.
To try to begin with but i really.
Realized there was a small cork of a.
Friend's if i'm going to be there for me.
No matter what and now i think of them.
Literally all the time and i've.
Literally had the same about spine group.
Since i first started to make it a three.
Years ago like they were the first ones.
I ever had and we've stayed close ever.
Since so very very blessed to have them.
In my life and you guys will be meeting.
Them very soon if you are be important.
There okay so leah asked who  how many.
People are usually behind the camera.
While you're filming your videos that's.
A good question for those you guys who.
Do not know when i first started youtube.
It was only just me doing everything and.
Now through three years of working on.
Production i do have a full team that.
Works around me every single day which.
Is so incredibly amazing and i'm so.
Grateful for all that i never really.
Talked about that one before my channel.
Because i feel like there's a very very.
Weird mindset when it comes to youtubers.
That like if you aren't doing everything.
Yourself that you're not like.
Anymore which is so weird i guess my.
Contact like speaks for itself hopefully.
What i have something i usually have my.
Manager jake in the room just because he.
Works at my house every single day so he.
Usually will just do his work upstairs.
I'm filming my assistant quinn it.
Usually that's where the camera as well.
Just make sure all my camera angles are.
Good and just have got me any products.
They have it's already on the table and.
I also have a writer named arrows who.
Will also sit behind the camera with me.
On the occasional video if it's really.
Cabinet to take your face video or every.
Review i always credit my team in all my.
Videos and i definitely had a few.
Questions about him and becoming like a.
Writer i know i call him my writer but i.
Guess he's more like a coordinator my.
Videos are definitely not scripted but.
You guys know that i definitely have a.
Major issue when it comes to stuttering.
And having to redo takes so haven't i.
Always said together before every single.
Video and kind of concept playing it all.
Out so i have notes and bullet points of.
Things that i want to say in the video.
Topics that i want to touch on or.
Sometimes even jokes that i want to make.
If i it really depends on the video or.
The day but there's usually around two.
People in the room with me while i'm.
Filming okay next question comes from.
Mari and she asks would you ever come.
Out with sister swimwear i am really.
Really excited for a lot of the stuff.
That is coming up soon on sisses apparel.
So if you guys are kind of keeping up.
With it for those you who do not know i.
Have a clothing line called sisters.
Apparel it is very fun very fresh very.
Cute what am i doing what what are we.
Doing i'm gonna turn around because this.
Sun is going down but it's very very.
Bright so i want to have you on my left.
Hand side to get my gold oh okay sisters.
Apparel for me started off as a merch.
Line which was really fun of course i.
Did like my repeating sisters hoodies.
And the sister sayings but my goal for.
Sisters abuela is not for it to be.
Merged but rather like an actual.
Clothing line so i really want to work.
On it i have so many amazing plans for.
Really really dope pieces that are a lot.
More than just like screen printing on a.
Regular merch id like i have a lot of.
Custom stuff that's already in the works.
The downtown clash that was done last.
Month.
All custom pieces which i absolutely.
Love i'm gonna have a lot more custom.
Stuff coming very very soon including.
Some eric up coming this summer so i'm.
Just really really excited i have a lot.
Of big fans for and i really genuinely.
Hope that it keeps going well the.
Support and sales recently have been.
Like through the roof like i'd never.
Expected it to do this well so i'm very.
Very grateful for all of you guys who.
Want to support and want to get the.
Pieces it's been so cool like seeing you.
Guys rocking them and your alpha and.
Just integrating them into your everyday.
Fashion so i'm really really happy i.
Can't wait to see what the future holds.
No you cannot make a left-hand turn here.
Lilia asks can you do a giveaway for all.
The broke sisters that can't afford your.
Merchant pallet so in this video no but.
Titus tell them yeah how we should just.
Tell them hmm should i tell them no you.
Could definitely tell them don't offer a.
Giveaway in this video because at the.
End of november but for every single oh.
My gosh i tell them yeah sure for every.
Single video that is being uploaded in.
December i will be doing a huge giveaway.
It just to say thank you can take it.
Back to cards oh my god i am so beyond.
Excited because last year i did a huge.
Holiday give us ladies and i have so.
Much fun doing it but i was like i think.
I have like two million followers at the.
Time and i was still saving all my money.
To like get a house and get a car so i.
Was not like doing well now we're at 10.
Million we're doing pretty good and.
Fresh thanks to all of you guys so i'm.
So excited because for the past several.
Months i've been saving up a lot of.
Money to put towards each holiday gameis.
Lights for you guys is here i want to.
Give back i want to give you guys some.
But really really nice and beefy gifts.
Just to say thank you everything that.
You've done for me so stay tuned for all.
My december videos because the giveaways.
Are going to be let.
I'm scared about that i'm just kind of.
Scared on the slate it'll be good.
Contact okay.
Frances asks can you come to the uk soon.
So i can be blessed and meet you please.
So i'm not really sure what i can and.
Can't say so i'm gonna be vade to avoid.
Getting in trouble because i don't like.
Getting in trouble but i will not say.
That there are definitely lots of travel.
Plans coming out very very soon for me.
Which is really good and fun and i'm so.
Excited because i'm gonna be bringing a.
Lot of my friends with me as well i do.
Not like travelling because being away.
From home and not being able to work.
Every single day gives me a lot of.
Anxiety especially time zone changes but.
Having my close friends around me it.
Makes it so much better having you guys.
Around the wake wing as well make.
Everything a lot better so make sure you.
Have a post notifications on because.
There definitely lots of announcements.
Coming very very soon.
Breezy cakes asks what do you want in a.
Boyfriend and why.
With apollo sucks number one i want a.
Boy who is strange.
Lot that for you that's easy it's you.
It's easier than you infect true.
Somebody who has not involved whatsoever.
With the makeup world and any way shape.
Or form because i need diversity and.
Variation in my life i would like.
Someone who is taller than me it's like.
A little spoon if you haven't met me.
Person you know that i'm kind of tall.
I'm 510 which is so annoying i wish i.
Was a little bit shorter like five eight.
You would be so cute for me i feel like.
So it's hard to find guys that are like.
Really tall and then somebody was funny.
Definitely i need a boy who was really.
Really funny because my life can be so.
Frustrating sometimes i definitely have.
Trust i'm super super easily so i need.
Someone who can make me laugh and make.
Me smile even only for some days you're.
Tall just email me and i'll filter them.
To texas yeah i'll filter them for him.
Okay on to the next question.
Amber asks what you've ever considered.
Doing pop-up shops for sisters apparel.
Let me the most says she says aaron asks.
Do you ever find it overwhelming trying.
To create content that accommodates to.
Everybody.
Oh yeah that is probably literally like.
The only downside to my job is trying to.
Produce content that everybody is going.
To enjoy like i talked about before i.
Definitely have a very very thick skin i.
Don't really get offended by many things.
But something that i do definitely get.
Hurt by a lot and i can admit this.
Openly is when people don't like things.
That i don't want to work into.
Really the big production videos or my.
Palate for examples like no i'm.
Obviously very very sensitive about.
Because i said this long to the poor but.
Like my pal was obviously my biggest.
Project in my entire career had.
Obviously my videos are all of equal.
Scale but i think of each individual.
Video as kind of like a mini production.
And a mini project as well so a lot of.
The work goes into a lot of the videos.
Whether it be in a production level or a.
Company that i'm working with or the.
Things that i'm actually doing for my.
Editing team is working really hard to.
Actually like make it really really.
Funny if i was having an off day so.
Everything one of the videos i like to.
Think of us like a mini project so it.
Definitely is really really hard to come.
Up with concepts that you know everybody.
Is going to enjoy it the reality that.
I've had it got a bigger over time.
Everybody isn't going like every single.
Video.
There's always gonna be people who don't.
Like it or who won't laugh as are things.
For who aren't gonna understand turn.
Makeup techniques or products the lexer.
And lux and it's definitely been saying.
That spark for me to kind of come to.
Terms with but i definitely chose i'm.
Getting better and better at it as i.
Keep going as a content creator and as i.
Get older as well so i definitely does.
Talk but at this point i'm just making.
Content that i'm really really proud of.
And for the most part most of you guys.
Enjoy as well so i'm just gonna keep.
Doing that.
Whoever once said watch can watch it.
Hopefully stay with us for a while.
Okay so masha asks what's something that.
Makes you want a sister snap every time.
Someone says it why don't you answer.
That question what are something you see.
Happen a lot in my life that makes you a.
No-entry so eating at a restaurant and.
Like james done a table and whatever.
Like when we went to chili's great.
Kidding waitress okay so the waitress in.
Arizona knew james or it was like.
Someone can go through you give me to.
Rent alone we're in arizona for.
Fourth-of-july trip that might like.
Parents took us on and then we went to.
Chili's one night and like that someone.
In the restaurant basically knew who.
James was so it was in the middle of.
Nowhere nowhere it was like we don't.
Even know where it was still and we were.
In those chilies and then the girl.
Texted all her friends who texted their.
Friends detectives their friends who.
Texted their friends who talked to their.
Parents and their grandmas and their.
Grandpas in their sisters and those.
Boyfriends and their children to all.
Come to this chilies and stampede of the.
Chili is really just mom it up for a row.
00 p.m. at night so there was.
We literally to start seeing people come.
Up to the windows and they're like hi at.
The windows of chili's and basically it.
Ended up with like a hundred people.
Showing up at this chili's all asking.
James for pictures well he literally.
Walked outside of chili's and there were.
A hundred people outside i was like.
Where did you all even come from like i.
Don't even know this many people lived.
In they have dinner area the thing that.
Annoyed me kind of not the house had.
People like they waited for you whatever.
Like okay that's nice.
Um but the people they were people just.
Come inside and ask for photos while you.
Were eating like just like come in and.
Be like hey do you think that'd be like.
Grab a photo really quick as i have my.
20 dollar dinner for two chicken pasta.
In it so that's probably what it is okay.
Tori walker asks are you thinking of.
Going on tour any time soon yes how's it.
Looking this is another quickie bianca.
Asks would you rather vacation on the.
Beach or in mountains also have a really.
Cool interruption.
Oh magic if we got pulled over that will.
Be good for the video really would be we.
Should try to break the law uh-huh wait.
Would rather go vacation the beach or.
The mountains cover the mountains i'm.
Not really a beach person i hate the.
Sand i hate the water mm-hmm yeah like a.
Good beach photo i like being in the.
Warm so it was like if it was like the.
Hawaiian now and it's down but i really.
Don't like the beach i hate sand if.
Sandra really gives me a gal and i don't.
Like being in cold water so okay so live.
Us what's your absolute favorite shade.
From the palette and why that is such a.
Hard question because i literally love.
Someone who close in there i would.
Probably have to say you're kidding just.
Because i've wanted a true matt writer.
For so long in my collection that i have.
Never been able to find one that i.
Really really like and i also really.
Like the defense my mom's shade so has a.
Very special place in my heart and the.
Yellow sheet is really really bombed too.
And scampered for my dad and brother for.
Dn and plenty for the twins you forgot.
About me and boutique for laura and me.
And artistry portrayal yeah and.
Playground for anthony i'm not artistry.
I'm mary mary oh okay there's a couple.
More questions kidding ava asks fine is.
Your full house to are coming as in.
Decorator.
Oh definitely stay on the lookout for.
The house obviously i want to be fully.
Decorated frame post the video and it's.
Going actually pretty well somewhere i.
Will say i'm definitely making far.
Better progress timing wise on this.
House decoration and then like my.
Apartment but it's still not even close.
To being done i have a few of videos.
Coming soon.
Perhaps a collab.
Wink wink but i really do want to get.
The house work on it as soon as possible.
Oh and should we give it a good.
Demonstration yeah but probably going to.
Like the middle i think right do you.
Think like over one more so you know.
There are 8,000 cars right here on.
Course all he doesn't this is not good.
Or fresh for us let's try it okay that's.
Going how was it doing that my car is.
Literally moving and staying in the way.
My favorite is when it lands did you see.
That i saw it it's gonna stop for this.
Ready this is the craziest car in the.
World this is so good for me to like.
Literally when you're a bad driver you.
Need this car like ten out of ten would.
Recommend okay i guess we can ask you.
Some questions while you're on autopilot.
Yeah you can maybe use some hand.
Gestures if needed.
Yeah miriam asked is there anyone in.
Specific who has changed the way they.
Are towards you because of the fame and.
Money like i said earlier on in the.
Video.
My cora cora friends have done the exact.
Same sets literally starting making up.
For the first time so i feel like my.
Close friends know and i'm so come to.
Cable for it but so many people from my.
Hometown have tried to come back and be.
Like oh my god.
I've said you're home and i'm like.
Absolutely not you can sit on my face.
Every single time that i ever so many.
Other straight boys to that used to.
Bully me every single day in high school.
Now sound chat me all the time usually.
Flirting with me so i guess it's not the.
Worst thing sending some piketty wickety.
Booze oh this is a good one to finish.
Off the q&a since i'm here i picked this.
One because um it really talked to me.
Son aria ask if you can honestly live.
With one person for the rest room.
I thought you'd answer that i decided to.
Literally will not move into the edit so.
Partially because really and we're.
Already together every single day i mean.
Really come to my house every single day.
Okay but okay so i'm like i have a.
Friend.
I come over every single day because i.
Like working out james says too because.
I work from home as well but no but we.
Need her a little bit of separation too.
Because sometimes when people move and.
Together it gets bad can people please.
Agree with me on that like why don't we.
Ever we've never gone in a fight yeah.
But there's potential to get in a fight.
I mean if we live together and something.
Bothered us i am at james's house six.
Out of seven days a week from morning to.
Night time so like just let me sleep at.
My house no i'm looking for new houses.
Right now andrew will be worried yeah we.
