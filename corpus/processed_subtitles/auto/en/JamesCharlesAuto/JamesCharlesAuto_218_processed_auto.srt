Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel a few.
Weeks ago if you guys are familiar with.
The tech world apple held their annual.
Event where basically every year they.
Announce their new.
Products their new way of how they're.
All going to get us to spend thousands.
And thousands of dollars.
Should i say that it's not funny should.
I say that.
Every year there's always a new iphone.
This year however they did not announce.
That which honestly i'm a little bit.
Annoyed about but what did launch.
Is ios 14 and oh my god i think it's.
Been a pretty long time since any of the.
Apple updates really caused like an.
Excitement or like a splash.
In society but i will say apple really.
Did sister snap with ios 14 because.
There are so many really.
Really cool exciting features that i.
Have been loving so far especially.
The ability to customize your home.
Screen i've already seen.
So many people across all different.
Social media platforms posting.
Screenshots.
And getting creative with their home.
Screens now mine still looks really.
Really boring i will show you guys it's.
Literally just my regular apps and i.
Added a fun little calendar widget so i.
Can see what's going with my day and i.
Really want to figure out how i can.
Customize my own home screen.
But until then i thought it'd be so much.
Fun to sit down take a look at what you.
Guys have created and do.
My makeup inspired by your ios 14.
Home screen.
Okay you guys i'm super excited to get.
Started and just sit down and play with.
Makeup today i tweeted earlier asking.
You to send me screenshots of your ios.
14 home screens and i am.
So jealous of how some of them are.
Looking so far and the first home screen.
That i want to show you guys is from.
Chloe and hers looks like.
This looking at chloe's home screen i'm.
Definitely noticing a few things right.
Off the bat it is very cute it's very.
Bright and it's also very.
Soft which is definitely giving me a lot.
Of inspiration for a fun makeup look to.
Combine all these elements in her.
Background she has these orange.
Butterflies and there's a user on.
Twitter that i follow named lauren her.
At is raggedy royal.
She had this whole like butterfly eye.
Look trend which could be really really.
Fun to do and.
All of her app icons are pink and.
Glittery which i normally.
Don't love her makeup looks you guys.
Have heard me talk about this but i feel.
Like i have a really good idea of how i.
Could pull.
All these elements into a fun look so.
Let's go ahead and see what we can come.
Up with.
Okay you guys so for the first step as.
Always i'm just going to grab a little.
Bit of concealer and put this on my.
Eyelid to act as my.
Rhymer and then we're just going to go.
Right in with our shadows so i think i'm.
Going to start.
First by grabbing actually let me not.
Use my palette for once i'm going to.
Grab the.
Perfect cosmetics like stacy marie.
Carnival palette and i'm going to dip.
Into this shade up here called.
Slow burn it's just a really pretty like.
Burnt orange color and i'm going to.
Pack this in the outer corner now that.
That's laid down i'm just going to grab.
A little fluffy brush.
And dip into honestly maybe a little bit.
Of a 518 and just blend that out if i.
Was gonna do this look myself i would.
Honestly probably start off with a much.
Darker color just because i really like.
High contrast but chloe's home screen is.
So.
Soft that i honestly feel like this will.
Be perfect i really want to match.
Chloe's muted pink tones as much as i.
Possibly can.
So i'm gonna grab the shade mary from my.
Palette on an m456 and use this color.
To further like the crease.
Music.
Um just put this here and i'm gonna grab.
Some pinkity.
Drinkity just on a fluffy brush and.
Blend out that.
Mary and i'm just gonna use a little.
Flat top concealer brush and some more.
Concealer to cut.
My crease now i'm just gonna grab a.
Little bit of sister which is like the.
Metallic.
Champagne shade i'm just gonna pack this.
Right onto.
The lid i'm also gonna use the shade to.
Highlight the inner corner as well.
Why does this look so patchy down here.
It's a pumpkin patch.
Yeah what is going on i guess it won't.
Really matter to be honest because it'll.
Be covered in.
A butterfly anyway there we go that's.
The shape that i'm going for.
Okay now i'm gonna apply some nice.
Glitter adhesive oh god i.
Hate hate using glitter it's just gross.
Like once you put on glitter you're.
Stuck with it for the next.
Roughly three to four business days okay.
So just mark.
A general note that i'm noticing i'm.
Just not feeling a lot of enthusiasm as.
I'm looking at the screen so i think.
That might read across.
The audience are you still filming yes.
And that looks okay okay so now that the.
Overall shapes and glitter are all on.
There it is time to add our butterfly.
Design so it's going to take my nice.
Liquid liner and i'm going to just do a.
Regular.
Wing okay now i'm just going to draw a.
Gigantic wing basically.
And i'm just going to add in the little.
Lines okay so now the same thing on the.
Little.
Lower wing situation okay and now the.
Last step of this.
Butterfly eye is just take a little bit.
Of white eyeliner.
And add in the dots oh hey.
Oh no hey oh he just peed.
Like the most p i've ever actually seen.
Great.
Mascara time all right you guys so this.
Is one eye of this look all complete i'm.
Gonna cut into the other one off camera.
Quickly and i'll be right back with the.
Finished.
Look i matched the other eye off camera.
Added a ton.
Of this beautiful baby pink blush some.
Pink highlighter and just did a cute.
Little ombre glossy lip and i think that.
Is this.
Soft pink butterfly look inspired by.
Chloe's home screen.
All complete i really love how this look.
Turned out today the soft orange and.
Pink tones work so beautifully together.
And remind me so much of the fall season.
Coming soon and even though the.
Butterflies on the eye.
Do look like a really really vibrant.
Statement piece they were actually.
Really really easy to do and i think.
This look was super.
Super cool thank you once again to chloe.
For suggesting it to me and i think it.
Is now time to move on to.
The next one yo yo.
This one that i have picked out is by.
Leah sencore.
And she sent me these screenshots of her.
Phone now as you guys can see it's very.
Like purple very periwinkle which is by.
Far my favorite color in the entire.
World.
And it's very just like common calming.
Yes is it weird to say like this would.
Remind me of like that lavender like.
Pillow spray that would like put you to.
Sleep relaxation.
Calming down ending off the day on a.
Positive.
Beautiful note vibes.
Sure i don't do makeup looks with this.
Color very often so i'm definitely.
Excited for this and as you guys can see.
On her little.
Widget smith app she has it's like this.
Very like purpley pinky.
Sky with little planets and stars like.
Drawn in as a cartoon over top which i.
Think is so.
So cute so i'm going to use that as my.
Source of inspiration for this makeup.
Look today.
As always i'm just going to take a.
Little bit of my concealer and use it as.
My eye.
Shadow base that i am using a really.
Light shade this time just because.
Since we're working with pastels we want.
Them to really pop.
First i'm just going to grab a little.
Fluffy brush and just use some different.
Shades of purple.
Uh maybe a little bit of single which i.
Still.
Am it's the subtle depression yeah i'm.
Not having a good day today you guys.
I'm single just really really single.
Today.
Now i'm just going to take my morphe 35i.
Palette and dip into the nice.
Pastel purple shade i love love love.
This color eyeshadow now i'm going to.
Take this nice pastel pink and really.
Just.
You know plop this in there warm it up.
And give some.
Pink clouds that looks like    okay.
Now i'm just gonna take a little bit of.
White.
I mean that looks like    wow you can.
Really tell that i'm not having a good.
Day huh oh my god.
Oh sorry guys not every day can be a.
Good one.
Now i'm just gonna start drawing in some.
Nice planets that's.
Saturn.
Shall we cut or just keep rolling no.
Let's just keep rolling.
Who knows maybe something great will.
Come out of this tell us.
Really shitty it just seems like every.
Time that i find somebody great.
It's like three seconds later they're.
Not but it's also like.
If it's not gonna work it's not gonna.
Work i mean i think by constantly saying.
That at least.
Forever and all that you put that out.
There that's what comes back to you.
I know it's just really hard to think.
Otherwise with all this like stupid.
That i've.
Dealt with to finish off the eyes i'm.
Just going to apply a little coat of.
Mascara since we did the white liner and.
Then also all the little white drawings.
I honestly don't want to do a full lash.
Because this is going to cover up all.
The work that we just did.
For my lips today of course i'm going to.
Match it right to it the eye so i'm.
Going to grab the ofra las vegas.
Liquid lipstick all right you guys will.
Know that the lips are all on and.
Matching the eyes very very perfectly.
I think that completes this pastel skies.
Look inspired by leah's ios 14 home.
Screen.
Honestly this might be one of the first.
Times while doing these like recreating.
Art videos that i haven't been in love.
With the final.
Look usually i'm like obsessed with them.
But honestly this time i don't really.
Know.
Leah's home screen in the color scheme.
Is so so cute and i feel like i had a.
Really good vision for this look in my.
Head but i honestly just feel like i.
Didn't do the best job executing it i.
Think the colors are really cute i think.
Like the white liner idea.
Was really really cute as well but i.
Just feel like this could have been a.
Lot better but i don't really know what.
I would have done.
To change it i would love to see how you.
Would recreate this and hopefully do it.
A whole lot better than mine.
It's a cute idea so regardless i hope.
You guys enjoyed this look and now it is.
Time to wipe it off and move on to.
The next one okay so when i tweeted it.
So when i tweeted you guys asking to.
Send me photos of your home screens.
There was a million different themes and.
Aesthetics.
But i did notice that there was one.
Style in particular that a ton of.
Different people were using.
And that was neon icons i picked out.
This photo from autumn.
Diane as you guys can see she has a very.
Like billy eilish green.
And black neon inspired lock screen.
Which i think looks super.
Super cool so i thought that this would.
Be a really fun trend to pull into.
A makeup look basically what i'm.
Envisioning for this look today is a.
Graphic liner that looks like it's like.
A neon.
Light against like a black backdrop.
Normally i would lay down the black.
First but i'm definitely concerned about.
Putting a collar over top of black.
Whatever let's just try and see what.
Happens i guess just placing the shadow.
In the general area where i want it to.
Be.
Obviously we're going to blend that out.
But i don't want to go too crazy with.
The block just yet because.
I mean y'all already know looks like a.
Like a literal drag queen eyeliner.
Okay now i'm just taking a little bit.
More of that black i'm going to use this.
On a fluffy brush to diffuse out these.
Edges.
Very very very very carefully put this.
On the lower lash line as well.
So now basically what i'm going to do is.
Grab a little bit more of this white.
Liner you see lots of white liner in.
This video i don't know why that ended.
Up happening that way but.
Basically i'm just going to grab a.
Little liner brush and sketch out.
Like the graphic liner that i want to do.
But i'm actually for ones.
Not going to worry about it being too.
Precise because we're going to blend it.
Out and now i'm just going to grab.
A little fluffy brush i saw a ton of.
People doing a green.
Nia but i also saw a lot of people doing.
Blue so maybe i'll actually do like an.
Ombre of the two colors do you think.
That'd be cool yeah i'm just gonna grab.
Some shadows just like this and i'm.
Going to pack that.
Right on top of that white liner just.
Like this.
That looks so cool oh that actually does.
Look kind of cool.
Oh period now i'll just switch it over.
To a little bit of teal in the middle.
I'm just gonna place a little bit of.
That green neon shade right in the inner.
Corner because we'll place a highlighter.
There later on so now that we have the.
Colors kind of messily.
Placed on there and like i said this.
Mess kind of was on purpose because this.
Is basically going to be like the glow.
Of the neon we don't want this to look.
Like the actual light just yet that's.
Going to be what happens right.
Now with a tiny little liner brush and a.
Little bit more white liner i'm going to.
Go in with a.
Second layer in that same general shape.
But this time i'm going to be much more.
Precise.
With my line oh i definitely want to add.
In that color to my.
Lash line oh my kind of fun wow that.
Actually turned out really good.
We love her off the juice cody guppy.
Tripping.
All right you guys well that was fast i.
Think that is one eye of this neon look.
All complete i was definitely worried.
About this technique at first but i.
Think that i got it down.
Pretty fast and i am loving how this is.
Looking at so far i'm gonna go ahead.
I'm gonna go ahead and do the other one.
Off camera quickly and i'll be right.
Back with the finished.
Look okay you guys the lips are on and i.
Think that they added such a cool like.
Punk vibe to this makeup look and i.
Think that is this neon look inspired by.
Diane's home screen all complete when i.
First saw people using neon icons in.
Their home screen.
Right away i knew the makeup look that i.
Wanted to create and spoiler alert it.
Was.
This one but i wasn't sure how i was.
Actually going to achieve that just.
Because sometimes layering on a bright.
Colors over top of black is like.
Literally impossible.
But i think that we nailed the technique.
And this looks so so.
So cool i've seen a lot of people do.
This neon liner before so i'm absolutely.
Not taking credit but i would love to.
See what you guys can come up with after.
Seeing this technique with all that.
Being said i have been down in the.
Studio for hours now voting this video.
And i think that it is time to bring.
This one to a close i had.
So much fun recreating these three very.
Different makeup looks from these three.
Very very different ios 14 home screens.
And i'm definitely looking forward to.
