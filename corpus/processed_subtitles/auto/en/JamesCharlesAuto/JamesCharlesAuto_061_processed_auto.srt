The crease i really haven't decided what.
Look i want to go for you but that's the.
Beauty of makeup you can kind of decide.

Orange moment on the top.
I think i want to bring it really really.
Smokey onto the bottom lashline and wing.

Bottom have a highly space into a skull.
A sister skull obviously the entire.
Makeup community always those following.
All of your launches and i'm definitely.

Tweeting about this halloween collection.
And you were like really really pumped.
About it yeah you want to talk about it.
I mean as everybody knows i do all my.
Own like reveal it's like my snapchats.
Because at a certain point someone asked.
Me to like why don't you just have.
Someone take the videos for you and then.
Program but i'm like i like to do it.
Myself because i know how i want my.
Makeup to look and i know i can get the.
Best lighting driver so after i showed.
People i just felt the love and the.
Response and i made me remember why i do.
What i do yeah so it was a pretty cool.
Feeling and it kind of reminded me what.
I used to feel like when i first started.
I get really excited about things i work.
For a very long time i work really hard.
On and i put like so much love into.
Everything right and i'm super i'm like.
A hundred percent involved in creating.
The packaging if i want this little.
Thing spot gloss or i want this metallic.
Material what kind of like cardboards.
Used i have someone who helps them with.
Renderings but i don't have anyone that.
Comes and shows me designs and say like.
You should do this and i'm like okay.
Approved approved approved i tell my.
Designer what i want you on the.
Rendering so yeah i'm just like really.
Involved so then when i finally show.
People and they get excited about it it.
Makes me very excited oh that's like.
Really everything yeah how long has.
Kylie girls would have been around this.
Is you're about to be three how is like.
Starting a makeup line and change your.
Life because it i mean that.
Single-handedly change the beauty.
Community thanks it changed my life.
Because it gave me purpose and it.
Allowed me to express myself it's really.
My passion it's like makeup so to be.
Able to live out my passion every day.
And like have fun while i work is.
Probably the best part doesn't want to.
Play with me called a quintessentially.
Enough very themes for this video i.
Started on a halloween actually almost.
Three years ago as well so buy for your.
Anniversary is coming up oh my god am i.
Did a skeleton luck - yeah this is.
Simple circle love that i was just.
Playing around with some makeup but i.
Had to save from being a few different.
Clients before and i.
But myself for the first time in our.
Yeah i was kind of fun and i actually.
Left a decent - so i just encounter.
Practicing it the first time i ever did.
Makeup is documented on instagram so.
Literally every single time sighs.
Selling one day and like 10 years.
They'll be able to literally pull yeah a.
Single time that i never wore makeup.
It's like so crazy so it's just like a.
Really amazing journey from literally.
Just doing in my basement - no else and.
Having it as a real job think sister if.
You're not watching youtube because.
Literally when i'm not working i'm.
Probably watching youtube videos what is.
Like a typical day of sister kylie kylie.
Cosmetics pretty much takes up most of.
My days and work on the weekends are.
Usually just me and stormy i try to.
Spend as much time with her as possible.
And then when i'm not spending time with.
Her i'm just working you know how.
Sisters for me sisters for me so good.
She's a twit sold but she's just.
Changing every day she really is.
Becoming like a little person she.
Reminds me a lot of kendall oh love that.
Personality sister kendall oh my god i'm.
Sure like being a mother has obviously.
Changed your life the most ever in the.
World i love that i really feel like.
This is what i've always was meant to do.
I used to have dreams even though like.
As a young at a young age of like having.
Kids really like actual dreams mm-hmm.
Like it was just a part of my life that.
I was crazy i don't feel like a.
Different person i just look at life a.
Little differently yeah do you wanna.
Have more i do want to have more when is.
The question right i'd want to give sur.
Me a brother or a sister sisters only of.
Course like i want seven girls and then.
Like maybe i'll consider a boy mm-hmm do.
You have anyway because you have yes i.
Love bananas for me how i thought of.
Stormy travis thinks that he thought of.
Stormy but it was you it was me i.
Remember the whole thing but he swears.
He made her name up i was just looking.
On.
Nature names like weather like earth.
Inspired willow was on there and then.
That's already tail oh you need a willow.
Jenner you think i'm probably taking i.
Know a willow it's man she is a great.
Willow i close with her so you know when.
You you know someone will join you you.
Can't really do that any time.
Yeah that's taken anyways normals on.
There yeah just storm like me oh yeah i.
Did stormy ie okay yeah and then it was.
Always stormy with an ie i mean i bought.
Custom things for her that's in her name.
Mommy.
Yeah but her the blog stormy ie and then.
I didn't fully choose her name i wanted.
To like have a week of just me and her.
To see if i wanted to change it was that.
One other name in mind but stormy always.
Felt like her name right when she was in.
The womb it's almost like she chose her.
Name so then when they called me from.
The birth certificate office and i was.
Finalizing the name they were like honey.
I want to spell it i was like st o rm i.
And they're like you sure and i'm like.
Yeah just an eye you just changed it.
Right there right then in there i taste.
Changes eyes and then they were like.
Okay and i hung up the phone i was like.
Damn i guess it's her name and then i.
Called travis and i was like i didn't.
Put an e i just found it with an eye he.
Was like that's cool this looks gorgeous.
Oh my god interpret reading this here.
Big story trick-or-treating i'm gonna.
Take her to one house whose christmas.
Ever and we live on a new street oh and.
There's no houses on that that's.
Probably good for you though just me and.
My neighbor i swear it's most quiet so.
Remember when on i'm gonna grab the.
Shade hawks on my axe.
Love that name i record this on the.
Lower lashline i wanted to look a little.
Bit of a smoky purple moment really just.
To dramatis eyes it and also like to tie.
End the whole skeleton with it's about.
To go on a very interesting forbes.
Article was just posted they had crossed.
Paths with the article some think it was.
Everywhere anything congratulations.
Billionaire status kind of.
Destroy the club one day here is cause.
Are you the most excited in the entire.
World you could put that in school i'm.
So excited it's definitely been such a.
Blessing to do what i love every day i.
Worked so hard i'm starting only a few.
Years ago crazy we're very close yeah.
You're only two years older than me it's.
Just really inspirational to see that.
Someone so young working so hard and.
Just like doing that you better major.
Source of inspiration to me and i'm sure.
A ton of other kids out there as well we.
Really want to work hard and just do.
Something for themselves i've obviously.
Done a few reviews on you and like on.
Kim's collections dozen people always as.
I'm sure you know are always commenting.
Stupid stuff like they don't do anything.
They have no talent.
You can business abby is a talent it's.
Definitely a talent the comment is it's.
So old at this point like everybody's.
Talents are different and in my opinion.
Being able to use your own name and.
Likeness in order to build a brand is.
One of the best homes in the entire.
World and like i will stand by that.
Until the end of time people do the same.
Thing to me they're like oh my god james.
Like you've literally gotten famous over.
Scandals and like stupid viral photos.
Like i don't like okay look it works you.
Guys are all still here yeah hello well.
I can see how hard you work and i know i.
Work so hard i could have been in the.
Same position and done it completely.
Differently and so could you right now.
On top of that purple i want to layer a.
Little something over top we're gonna.
Grab the hell out gorgeous a glitter.
Eyes and just a little bit of a.
Concealer brush and just pop that right.
On top of the cut crease that we've.
Already made just to intensify to make.
It look a little bit more matala.
Were you like an artist before makeup.
Yeah that was 2016 alright so that's.
Pretty much the eyes all complete but.
We're not that with this look yeah.
Because i'm gonna turn you into a sister.
Skeleton let's do it i just want to take.
It like to the next level copper go home.
Write down because honestly i never.
Really get crazy with my eyes like this.
But i'm really serious like this is like.
Crazy for your eyes yeah.
What's crazy for your eyes mmm a lot.
More the mess but no i love it i think.
It looks super mom i would actually go.
Out like this but let's do it.
So another skeleton today i need to.
Sketch out like the highlights first.
Okay so then i can focus on the shadows.
Okay so i'm gonna use a white eyeliner.
Pencil and i start right up above you're.
Over here what is the craziest making.
We've ever had on really probably.
Speaking of a crazy makeup looks what.
Has been your worst red-carpet moments.
Music.
Just changed so much i see photos of me.
All day that's just like nah girl like.
Whatever but i don't care i'm also not.
The type of person that a lot of people.
Probably think i am except my true fans.
Have seen me like looking like super.
Crazy out i don't really care like i.
Leave the house every day not thinking.
I'm kylie really hmm.
Like i i don't really feel like i have.
To leave the house in full like put.
Together outfit and glam and i'm just.
Like i hope no one catches me they.
Usually do i'm always crazy on the.
Streets but i can't think of one.
Specifically all i know is that my.
Change i wanted to catch out the teeth.
On your lips did you have like a paper.
Makeup look that you've ever worn to a.
Red carpet or twin event before my.
Favorite makeup look was when i wore.
Teal hair long teal hair arielle did my.
Makeup that's my favorite not because i.
Think it's the best we've ever done but.
I think that started like how i like my.
Makeup done like we figured out my look.
And then we perfected it alright we are.
Back and the highlights are all done i.
Was getting a little hot and steamy.
We're gonna go to the shadows now just.
Because it comes to everything kind of.
Like backwards order because adding.
Weight over top a block is a lot harder.
And the other way around.
I'm actually just gonna lightly like.
Inner line i guess the black parts as.
Well because i'm actually gonna use the.
Purple shade hacks on my axe to blend.
Everything and it's like a midnight.
Skull instead of just like luck makes it.
More fun on some dimension.
What sister would use here the closest.
Whether i know definitely the growing up.
Throw the closest in age yeah right now.
I talk to them all for like different.
Things daily probably chloe kim since.
We're both like just have three babies.
Together pretty much they up ladies all.
Day your mom in chicago we're taking a.
Bath last night together in my house.
Blah blah they're just all like really.
Are so now those lines are all lined out.
Thank god i'm you get to move on to the.
Actual pump part which is going to be.
Once again the eyeshadow so i'm gonna go.
To the shade hacks on my axe and i'm.
Gonna start using this a little bit of.
Settings brian how does it like growing.
Up in the public eye in spotlight it has.
Like i mean i definitely think that it's.
Not for everybody and i was chosen to be.
In this position cuz i feel like god.
Knows that i'm strong mm-hmm because a.
Lot of people just come even times i'm.
Like.
Really but i feel like it's just my life.
Like i don't know anything i don't know.
Normal is also i have like the best.
Family ever we're all in it together and.
The second one of us like gets out of.
Line or like right but if way back to.
Like if i didn't have my family.
Especially i feel like i would just i.
Mean they keep me grounded too right.
It's important mm-hmm.
Gotta stay on ball to finish off the.
School i'm just gonna grab a little.
Purple duo crow highly a moment and just.
Places on some of the kind of center.
Areas just to give a nice little blue.
Purple highlight oh everything that's.
Fun so the skull is basically all.
Complete and to finish off kylie's look.
Today i'm gonna grab the brand new.
Highlighter and the shade go ghost this.
Color is so cool it's like it kind of.
Looks a little green minty yeah but it.
Comes off on the skin pretty gold oh my.
God it's like oh wow that is cool.
