Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel today.
You can see i've done today a very very.
Special guest and one of the og sisters.
My best friend in the entire world.
Sister laura since it is the beginning.
Of math that means prom season is here i.
Am so excited to see all my beautiful.
Friends going to prom.
I remember last year for me prom was one.
Of the most magical experiences of my.
Entire life and i know it's like a dream.
For everybody so for today's video i.
Teamed up with sister laura of course.
But also with ava hair nyc those are you.
Guys who don't know before i actually.
Did makeup or ever even try and make up.
In the first place i didn't used to do.
Hair styling and that was my big passion.
And job forget like two or three years.
Before i ever picked up a foundation or.
Blending marks or anything of the sort i.
Was holding hairspray curling wands and.
Lots of coltan of bobby pins it has been.
A good two or three years since i've.
Actually picked up a hair styling tool.
So it was so fun and crazy to think this.
Look i am honestly so shocked that i.
Still have this in me.
I created this like braided updo.
Situation on sister laura i'm really.
Really proud of how it turned out we.
Even have her extensions hidden which is.
A very very very hard thing to do.
When it comes to hair styling so we were.
Super one anothers it turned out and i.
Also created this makeup look - it's.
Very very light airy duty with just a.
Simple papa glitter on the leg perfect.
For prom i would say if i makeup it's.
Fun to be super super glam but just like.
It's the best version of yourself.
Because it even want to be photographing.
Well no flashback mary's situation and.
Just a whole lot of like beautiful fun.
Pictures with all of your good friends.
On this very special high magical night.
That being said this is going to be a.
Crazy combination at tutorial all in one.
So i'm going to show you guys how to.
Think this hairstyle first then we're.
Gonna go right into the super easy.
Makeup look so if you wanted to see how.
You created at both of these looks make.
Sure you keep on watching alright guys.
So we're starting off with laura's hair.
Already pre-washed off cameron's in the.
Clean it up shampoo and a soften up.
Conditioner we then went to the therapy.
Session hair masks which are all.
Scientifically proven to strengthen hair.
We did this off-camera or let it be.
Sitting here for like 54 hours and then.
We went on with the main magic time in.
Wanna primer we're gonna be using a.
Whole lot of product today.
I'm just gonna spread says all over the.
Air to make sure it was really locked in.
Place and ready to go for styling of all.
Of that sorts of stuff i they don't live.
It with the steerer but just to prep the.
Tips and middle of the hair to protect.
From heat because obviously very amusing.
Lots of tools like will gyro.
Straightening iron curling wands we want.
To make sure if laura's hair is very.
Very safe and protected because yeah we.
Don't want it to die and fry off and.
We're going to go into this hair dryer.
And just dry laura's hair because it is.
Still wet we did just wash it up few.
Minutes ago and obviously if the hair.
Needs to be drying for it to be silent.
So i'm just using this hair dryer and a.
Flat brush just to a bun boot brush.
Through the hair on the hair dryer so it.
Straightens at the same time and then.
We're going to go with the straightening.
Iron as well just to go over all of.
Laura's care to make sure it is.
Superduper straight and prepped for.
Asylum.
I'm just going to take small little.
Sections as always and just straighten.
The hair all the way around including.
Like these for these parts in the front.
Because lord does have extensions in her.
Hair so for the most part the extensions.
Are straight for her normal hair is not.
Straight so we need to make sure they.
Are really really blending together to.
Begin the curling process i'm going to.
Section off lois hair and split it right.
In half down the town of behind that was.
Enough for some reason and then i went.
To the iva nyc at texturizing spray this.
Is really going to help to style the.
Hair and make sure it is super super.
Locked in place and ready to go and also.
Provides a lot of volume i'm then going.
To this color one and look like to just.
Begin curling all of lauren's hair i'm.
Going to just wrap the hair around in.
Small sections and then once that coat.
Is done i'm gonna hold it in my hand.
Just to make sure it is really really.
Locked in place before i let it down.
Just like that i'm gonna go around and.
Crawl all of those hairs is done we're.
Gonna take a little bit of time but i.
Would have had my sped up the process.
And cut a ton of out rolls do you guys.
Have to be sitting here for 16 hours.
Only crawl for her but yeah i'm just.
Gonna curl it all in to loose sections.
I'm also switching up the direction as.
Well so they all don't look very very.
Unifying we do not want them to be like.
All super tight bringing that curls but.
They are gonna start off a little type.
Of we're just gonna brush them through.
Later on and they're going to loosen up.
And look much more better.
A lot more like natural and kind of.
Warned that is the look we were going.
For today and that'll be perfect for.
Styling the updo coming in a few seconds.
I'm going ahead and i took down the top.
Of laura's hair which as you can see is.
Very very frizzy and maybe my dad was.
Saying before she does have extensions.
So i'm not just going to go ahead and.
I'm going to curl the top sections as.
Well making sure they blend well.
Together with the bottom portions and.
Then i'm just going to brush everything.
Together next i want to start doing this.
Tiny little braid on laura's hair she.
Does have a side part not a middle part.
So i'm starting this on the lower of the.
Two parts if that makes any sense at all.
I'm just starting by up doing a normal.
Braid with three strands then i'm adding.
Hair as i go over the middle strand i.
Think this is pretty hard to explain.
I've never actually done a hair video.
Before so if you guys want me to do more.
I can definitely try to like get better.
At angles or like explaining these type.
Of things i've been doing this for years.
Now so it just kind of comes firsthand.
To me but i am just doing a normal braid.
And adding sections in very very tiny so.
It creates a smaller ablated effect and.
Like i said lower does have extensions.
Illinois are these tiny sections and.
Pull this braid up to the head i'm being.
Very very strategic in line place then.
Just make sure those extension tapes are.
Very very well hidden.
Once that brings all done i'm just.
Finishing off and braiding off the rest.
Of the hair and then i'm going to go in.
I'm going to a pancake the braid this is.
A technique i learned from a cute girls.
Hairstyles here on youtube they are an.
Amazing channel but i'm just taking the.
Hair and i'm lightly pulling out the.
Sides of the strand just make the bring.
Up a lot more volume and kind of make it.
Look like effortless and kind of like.
Lived and now i'm gonna fake this little.
Like poop on at the top this is often in.
A lot of wedding hairstyles and i'm.
Gonna add it for this hairstyle today.
But i didn't really don't want to do a.
Lot of tv because laura's extensions.
Make that very very far so i'm taking.
This section from the crown boy's head.
And tying it off into a high pony and.
Then i'm gonna just grab some bobby pins.
And i'm going to push that ponytail.
Upwards creating a little pouf in the.
Back and it's gonna pin that in place i.
Use like 4 or 5 bobby pins make sure.
It's really really locked in there but.
By having this hair tie there it does.
Allow us to push that ponytail up.
Creating that focu without having to use.
Like 54 million pounds of hairspray and.
Bobby pins i'm a-goin and leaving out.
Small sections on the left.
The hair but seeing a large chunk of.
Curls from the middle and i'm going to.
Tie these together this is one of my.
Favorite tricks to do it very very super.
Quick updos i can pull the updos.
Together in like 30 or 40 minutes when.
Sometimes it takes up like an hour or.
Two hours depending on little curls in.
Place so all i did with scraps together.
The big chunk of curls into a ponytail.
And i'm just pinning the little sections.
To the back of laura's head this is kind.
Of hard to explain but just watch as i.
Go and now i'm taking the sections from.
The left and right sides as well just.
Forming them and little curls little.
Ringlets and just pin them to the sides.
Of the head this creates the effect as.
If i literally sat there and each curl.
To the head when in reality we just.
Created them into a big little like big.
Curly fun but i think the same effect.
Than it looks equally as beautiful and.
It saves you so much time like i said.
Before i'm just playing around with.
Different areas different places kind of.
Just playing around with the hair thing.
Where i would say sure that kind of be i.
Decided to take these left and right.
Sections and pin them underneath the.
Hair just to kind of give it the bond a.
Little bit more shape and volume just.
Ratio that nothing was i really flying.
Around and just kind of locks it in.
Place i know that excess hair i was.
Gonna pin it i think right up to the.
Slide yeah i just pinned it right up.
Again then it finished all i was gonna.
Grab the braid and pin it right over the.
Top of the bun and just lock it in place.
Beep in the excess and light as well and.
That is the completed updo and i'm just.
Gonna finish off by spraying it with.
Some dry shampoo to lock it anna please.
Now we're gonna talk with lois to make.
Up for today for her foundation i went.
Into the urban decay all nighter this is.
Laura's pret favorite foundation that.
She absolutely loves it and it just like.
The name says this is for prom obviously.
So we do want to be wearing it all night.
Long and you want to last through all.
The dancing and getting tough on the day.
Before and hopefully.
Conde so yeah it's a great foundation or.
Concealer tonight little using the apart.
Shape concealer as i said this is my.
All-time favorite and it is more as well.
I definitely got her hooked on this so.
We're just putting this in the high.
Points of the face and then it's gonna.
Blend it out really really quickly using.
My beauty blender i know i'm going.
Through this super super fast but.
There's a lot going on in this tutorial.
It is two parts like i said before so if.
It was like a normal time it would.
Really be here for 54 hours so i really.
Hope you guys are like understanding.
What's going on and then i'm going to.
Set loris face in place using the rcm a.
No color powder i've never actually.
Tried this powder this is my first time.
Using it today but laura loves and.
Recommended it to me and i love it as.
Well now so i definitely will be a buy.
Myself a bottle and trying it out for.
Sure i just went ahead in my bronze.
Alloys face using hoola bronzer this is.
Both of our all-time favorite balancers.
And it works very very well for both of.
Our skin tones so i'm just really.
Broadening at my face lightly i don't.
Want to really be doing a lot of a.
Contouring and then it's going in with a.
Beauty blender once again and one that.
Rc made no flower powder just to lightly.
Baked lower space underneath those.
Highlighted area so just lock everything.
In place for brows today i'm using the.
Benefit from system eyebrow pencil in.
The shade number 4 i apologize this is.
Out of focus.
I'm not really sure why for some reason.
To call down to my face which is.
Obviously not the purpose of this video.
So i'm sorry but i'm just lightly.
Filling in her eyebrows and then of.
Course with an angle brush and some more.
Shape to concealer just to clean them up.
And shake them like they're all good and.
So i started i'm using a modern.
Undisclosed palette and i'm working with.
This burnt orange shade on my morphe m4.
23 brush and this we're doing a really.
Really light halo eye i just picked up.
This orange shade on the one thing and.
That same brush and i'm going to be.
Doing that in the outer and inner.
Corners and just lightly blending that.
Out then i'm gonna go into the shade of.
The mirror on this light fluffy brush.
And just pop this in at the very very.
Center of it.
This color is so beautiful i absolutely.
Love it and it just creates a very very.
Open and beautiful effect i'm then going.
To over line it with the urban decay.
Glitter liner in the shaded midnight.
Cowboy just create a pop of bitter on.
And then going to the bottom i shied.
Away with you or about four orange.
Eyeshadow her mascara i'm using the.
Benefit roller lash mascara this is both.
Me boys all-time favorite heaven for.
Having me a highlighter which is.
Actually so balm i really do buy the.
Inner created a beautiful blonde for.
Laura and finally for the lips i'm using.
The jewel a clock and skinny dip and.
That create chestnut bagon i can breathe.
Again and this is the completed problem.
Laura she's in her promise i know it.
Looks like she's naked but if we sit up.
A little bit you can tell there she has.
A black or strapless custom not getting.
Flagged today - don't try us i had it so.
Much fun teaming up with ava and my c to.
Create this hair look it's honestly been.
Like three or four years since i've done.
