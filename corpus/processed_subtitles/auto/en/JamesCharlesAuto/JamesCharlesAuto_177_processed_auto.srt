Sister miko with this amazing a.
Beautiful rainbow speckled a paint faced.
Her oh my god you guys this is literally.
So sunny all the colors on it are.
Literally so vibrant i'm feeling so.
Inspired and i want to put this on my.
Face right now so without further ado i.
Already have my full base on of course.
This is gonna be a mostly eye shadow.
Kissed look once i got think it.
Everybody else who entered but let's get.
Started.
I went ahead and do two guys in a little.
Bit welcome to my base all i know i get.
A lot of complaints a lot when i do do.
Makeup and videos that you guys can't.
Actually see what i'm doing.
Sorry about that as usual i'm gonna.
Focus on one eye intensely on camera.
Here just because we kind of have a lot.
Going on and i don't want to sit here.
For eight hours and neither do you so.
That's the tea on that i think we're.
Gonna start off with just a little brush.
This is the my 14 years coating for 10%.
Off and dip all four more feet you guys.
Already knew that and dip into kind of a.
Yellow shade and pop that yeah just.
Gonna pop that right here on the inner.
Corner i'm not really sure the order in.
Which i'm gonna kind of do this look.
Today i think we're just gonna really.
Throw on some colors and hope and pray.
That it looks good that's kinda what i.
Do in all my makeup tutorials and it.
Usually or so kind of so that's what.
We're doing great it's henna cool.
Because.
Enrico's drawing here all the colors are.
Placed really really close together but.
Are still very wounded out which is.
Extremely hard to do so props to him i'm.
Gonna take a kind of bright peachy ready.
Orange shade with an m 506 and place.
That right in the crease return that.
Color shift between the yellow and red.
And then the purple and blue kind of.
Happens like here-ish so i think i'm.
Just gonna pack a little bit more on.
Music.
Maybe that looks not good oh my god it's.
So hard to blend yellow oh please go on.
There that might be a facetune moment.
Now i'm gonna take an am up to 13 and a.
Dark red shade and use this to really.
Cut out where i'm gonna place that.
Crease which is gonna be right here.
Hopefully that looks so busted a hole oh.
My god.
It's just gonna work it's gonna work.
Right now okay great next i'm gonna take.
A curve ball shade on an m 514 once.
Again and i'm gonna place that next door.
To that like burgundy area kind of right.
Up in here.
Oh that's pretty t and then before i.
Actually go and blend that further i'm.
Going to grab that dark red shade once.
Again and use that to kind of easily.
Transition the purple into oh.
James charles forgetting how to do.
Makeup for five minutes trey i'm scared.
Mostly the purple it goes down and.
Really cuts out the crease moment and.
Then we have some blue that is there too.
I'm gonna grab that same purple on a.
Kind of liner i think this is a lip.
Brush i have no idea and put that in the.
Crease once again just like we did with.
This front part kind of lining where i.
Want the colors to go or at least like.
Where i think they're gonna go there's.
Lots of purple and up here so i'm just.
Gonna put that there yeah we're gonna.
Regret that later i'm gonna blend these.
Two together so it doesn't look like.
Gross and it's watching i'm gonna kind.
Of fun okay cool.
Now i'm gonna grab a medium tone of blue.
Shade and this i want to use kind of.
Like a hawking brush since i really want.
This blue shade to be kind of a quite.
Pigmented so i'm going to grab that and.
Place that right there.
Oh well that blue is so pretty.
T.
Music.
That looks bad.
Who's gerd okay then i'm just gonna go.
Out like a lighter blue and place that.
Right over that to blend that ow and i'm.
Gonna be putting a blue highlight in the.
Brow oh my god this looks disgusting on.
Camera what's happening then it's going.
To go the anasazi up moonchild palette.
This literally it used to be my favorite.
Highlighting palette of all time this is.
Like one of the og makeup lover moments.
Like when this released though nation.
Was shaking including me and as you can.
Tell this is bana clearly quite used so.
Under got the shade star and i'm gonna.
Place this right on lieth brow bone to.
Hopefully pick some of this horrible.
Blending that i have going on i don't.
Know what i'm doing what is that that is.
It doesn't even look oh okay i guess.
That's okay it's really pretty if you.
Look at it like from this angle i'm like.
Only that angle.
Okay this looks absolutely the absolute.
Worst but you know what maybe when we.
Cut it in a look a little bit better i'm.
Gonna grab a shape tape in the shade.
Fair i was like to cut my crease no.
Matter what look it's using a really.
Light concealer just to kind of act as.
Like an eyeshadow base and my favorite.
Brush to cut the crease is going to be.
The mac 242.
No discount code but it's still good oh.
Music.
My god wait this looks actually pretty.
Now that it's getting kind o t cool if.
You guys went sister subscribers for a.
Long time you would know that this is.
Actually not the way that i used to do.
Cut creases i used to draw out the.
Bottom line first and then blend the.
Shadows upwards which was definitely a.
More complicated process but for some.
Reason i had never best up when it came.
To actually drawing the shape now that i.
Switch over to the dark side and do this.
Technique of drawing creases can never.
Get them even should it is stuck to i.
Got it you all lied now that the creases.
All caught i'm just gonna take a flat.
Top little brush and just pack on some.
Of my face powder.
Really carefully obviously not to mess.
The shape up but i want to set this in.
Place once again it before i put on any.
Eyeshadow and also just because that's.
What you do oh this is looking good now.
Okay now i'm kind of happy i excited a.
Little bit low key okay let me stay.
Humble for a second before this gets.
Ugly again okay so it looks like there.
Is her weight yeah i don't think there's.
Purple on the lid i think i wonder what.
They want me to do while i decide what's.
Gonna go on the lid i'm gonna go ahead.
And line this with white.
Now that we have the crease all cut we.
Have the lid to do and i'm honestly.
Having a little bit of trouble telling.
What's on the lid it looks like there's.
Kind of like a purple moment with a like.
Sparkly moment in the middle which i'm.
Definitely down for so i think i'm just.
Gonna kind of line this with purple and.
Two hour goes i'm just gonna use an.
Angle brush to do this just because i do.
Want to be a little bit precise i'm.
Gonna be really careful and just tuck.
That purple right up against that white.
Line i do have a feeling that i'm gonna.
Have to go back in once i finish the.
Purple portion and realign it which is.
Fine but obviously no ideal because.
That's like a lot of work that i don't.
Really want to do this winged portion is.
Gonna go like here since i haven't had.
As much time to really sit down and do a.
Lot of this creative looks anymore which.
Hurts my soul every single day i think.
Every time i do actually try to do that.
I think i'm literally changing my plan.
In freaking out every single look.
Because halfway through all hate it and.
Then five minutes later i'll be in love.
With it and then every step just keeps.
Changing like that does not look good.
We're fresh gonna put some purple right.
Here and then i guess i'm gonna put.
Glitter on the lid i don't know what.
Color i want to do yet but we're gonna.
Make that decision together probably.
Take a light blue i should probably just.
I'm right literally right back into blue.
Like this blue.
And i'm gonna pull it all the way into.
The inner corner because there will be a.
Pop of white there eventually.
Music.
That's like good enough whatever i'm.
Gonna play some reflect steal from mac.
Right on the center of that lid to.
Really make that blue pop us a little.
Bit and create the effect of the halo i.
Oh yeah that's pretty.
I was probably about idea what am i.
Doing.
Finally that looks like okay now that we.
Have all the liner done kind of i'm.
Gonna start sketching out death because.
This is getting really hard then it's.
Gonna pack on some purple right over.
Here and blend that out for a real one.
Music.
Kind of happy with that okay i'm gonna.
Take that bright burnt red shade from.
Before and place that right next order.
This powerball below the liner and kind.
Of blend those two together and pull the.
Shade right off into the lower lash line.
Music.
Great looks actually good for once just.
Gonna use a few different m-43 threes.
With some different oranges and reds on.
Them to really make sure everything is.
Kind of blended together i'm gonna take.
The atom up five to one it's kind of.
Like a bigger pocket - and i'm gonna.
Place this like orange shade kind of.
Like right here and actually tuck this.
Orange right into the highlight and into.
The blushed region as well because on.
This photo this blush is like gorgeous.
Pink orange moment i kind of want to.
Just pull the eyeshadow right and.
Everything and have it all blend it.
Together which looks so what's done to.
You see this is where i get and the look.
Is starts to come together and then i.
Stop complaining every three seconds.
Don't take that red shade once again and.
Blend this purple region together i'm.
Gonna bring back a little bit about.
Purple shade and then i want to take a.
Peachy metallic blush shade that is.
Literally my favorite thing the entire.
World right now and i'm gonna use this.
And put it right over the blush region.
Oh my god and finally last but not least.
To complete that cheap region i'm just.
Gonna grab up my favorite blush mac.
Peaches which is like this little orange.
E moment i'm just a kind of really.
Intense rocker brush and i'm going to.
For once really pack on that peach blush.
Right below that pink highlight moment.
To really tie it all together oh you're.
Kidding me i'm so talented just gonna.
Put a little the excess right on my nose.
Because it's a little bit peachy in the.
Photo looks so cute oh he gonna go back.
Into that white shade because this is.
Looking a little bit crusted.
Now i'm gonna grab some yellow and put.
Docked right in at the center of the.
Lower lash line and then finally since.
It is by far my least favorite color in.
The entire rainbow i'm just gonna place.
A little bit of the green shade right.
Here on in a corner and i'm gonna make a.
Little bit of room for it to be a kind.
Of the inner corner second cui's moment.
As well green is literally the ugliest.
Colors right well sorry no offense it's.
Just the truth tea.
Like literally who made green that is.
Gonna mount a great um i need a white.
Gel liner oh i did it ready oh my god.
Great i love when that happens.
Okay this i literally just took me two.
Hours to do um that was neither good nor.
Fresh but that being said i'm gonna go.
To the other eye off-camera hopefully it.
Does not take me two hours or you may.
Not see me even back here but assuming.
That i'm able to get it done i'll be.
Right back in a few seconds to finish.
Off the rest of the vlog i'll raise this.
Is we are back up old lights are now.
Done it literally it did take me two.
Hours to do the other eye so that's good.
I am exhausted and very hungry but you.
Know we're gonna get through this.
Together just like we always do so i.
Finished you there i um i also popped on.
The lash lily lashes in the south miami.
Using proteins for 15% off and now i'm.
Going to highlight my face.
So pretty.
Right on the center of the nose hello i.
Like this look it's kind of like rainbow.
Dragon balls find a bigger lash line.
Hello maybe not looking at the face.
Shirt this picture has a lot of like.
Rainbow coloured freckles all over which.
Is kind of really cool and fun and fresh.
So i'm gonna grab a white liner and i.
Guess i'm just gonna dot this like all.
Over my face this looks really pretty i.
Don't know if i want to put have to oh.
Oh that's too big.
Oh no gonna put on the center of the.
Eyelid oh god please don't get on the.
Lashes no okay.
Music.
There's definitely some definition.
Within the actual little colored dots.
That we have on the space chart so i.
Just grabbed the nyx vivid bright liquid.
Liners and also a karlie liquid lipstick.
In a bright pink shade i think this is.
Say no more and i'm going to use all.
These different colors as well to add in.
Some more dots just to provide some.
Variation.
Music.
Oh my god i actually love this you're.
Kidding yeah we love a polka-dotted.

Six hours later here is the finished.
Face chart inspired by mclean true ache.
A sister miko all complete oh my god you.
Guys i love how this turned out let's be.
Real and process was definitely a little.
Bit of an emotional roller coaster when.
I first started out i was having a lot.
Of trouble getting the clothes pigmented.
Blending them together cutting it on the.
Crease getting everything even it was.
Truly a little bit of a sister struggle.
To say the least but we got there in the.
End and i think like i was saying in the.
Video it is definitely one of those.
Looks that had a quite a few ugly.
Moments in between but in the end it.
Always turns out looking pretty and this.
