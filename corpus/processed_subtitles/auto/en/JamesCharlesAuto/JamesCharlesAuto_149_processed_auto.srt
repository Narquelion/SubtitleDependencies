Doing something different that i've.
Never done before but i've actually.
Wanted to this video for a very very.
Long time.
And it is finally happening so in case.
You happen to miss that which at this.
Point i don't even know how you would.
Have i mean literally like hello that's.
Me lifting up the rock that you've been.
Living under i've heard leasing a.
Full-on collection with more be.
Including a 39 shade artistry palette.

Custom tubby and blending sponge as well.

All that is launching in just a few days.
Now on november 13th at 8 a.m. pacific.
Time on more feet calm and in all ultra.
Retail locations on november 16th it is.
Literally going to break makeup history.
The model for this collection as i'm.
Sure you guys can see me right literally.
I'm building at this point is unleash.
Your inner artist and i firmly did both.
The palette and picked all the brushes.
For the brush set to be for my working.
Artists out there to literally be able.
To create any look possible and one of.
My missions in the beauty community i.
Obviously kind of skyrocketed very very.
Quickly but i always love to shout out.
Smaller artists and to get inspiration.
From them because i feel like small.
Artists the ones to keep this industry.
Going and i know from me they've been a.
Major source of inspiration for my more.
Creative looks if you've been following.
On instagram which if you're not you.
Need to go follow right now i'm doing.
The sisterhood we were almost 10 million.
Sisters showing on instagram as well.
It's pretty good and fresh handle it you.
Would know that on sundays sometimes i.
Do it sister takeovers where i basically.
Have a smaller artist come on and take.
Over my instagram story for the day and.
Give a live tutorial and create a really.
Bomb and beautiful makeup look and i've.
Truly found so many amazing accounts.
That i love getting inspiration from and.
Not to toot my own horn as well but.
We've definitely been able to help my.
Few small artists gain upwards of 50,000.
Followers and only one day which has.
Been it so incredibly amazing here in.
The makeup community it has been a known.
Fact that reviews aren't always exactly.
The most genuine now i'm very confident.
That you guys are going to love the.
Palette but in honor of my sister's.
Sunday takeovers.
On this launching and in honor of the.
Fact that i have not slept in about.
Three months now i hand chose four.
Artists that i love that i look up to.
That have inspired me that i think have.
Really really amazing messages here in.
The make up community and i asked them.
To come here to california to film in.
This studio so before the pilot actually.
Launches you sisters at home get to see.
A few different artists all that have.
Different skin tones testing ethanol out.
For the first time in using different.
Products different techniques different.
Colors and hopefully all creating.
Beautiful looks so you guys are able to.
Make a more educated decision on if you.
Want to buy it or not.
Every one that i pick today is so.
Incredibly talented and they all have a.
Very special place in my heart - i think.
You guys are going to absolutely love.
Them so you better be sister supportive.
And without further ado i'm going to.
Stop rambling you're welcome for once in.
My life i'm going to chill out take a.
Little bit of a break and celebrate this.
Launch and i'm gonna let all four of.
These people take the center stage and.
Let them all unleash their inner arms.
Music.
Hi everyone so my name is zachary and i.
Created this look with the new james.
Charles palette that he collaborated.
With morphe on i'm super super excited.
To be able to show you guys how to.
Create this really colorful and vibrant.
Look so if you want to see how to do it.
Then please stay tuned so to start off.
The eyes i'm gonna use the morphe 22 to.
Begin the blending process okay so i'm.
Gonna begin by applying the shade skip.
Right into the beginning of my crease.
Keeping it a lot closer to the nose.
Bridge you guys this palette is so.
Pigmented i just dipped into the first.
Shade and mind you this is the first.
Time that your girl is dipping into this.
And let me tell you this pigment sister.
James did not come to lady was alright.
Sisters so i went ahead and primed my.
Eyes with the paint pot from mac in the.
Shade painterly just before i began.
Blending so i could really make these.
Eyeshadows hop and perform so now i'm.
Gonna pick up this m4 for one brush.
Which you can also find in the.
Collection that james is releasing with.
This palette i'm gonna go ahead and pick.
Up the shade playground and place that.
Right in the center of my crease and.
Fade it out with the edges alright so on.
The m4a1 brush i'm gonna go ahead and.
Pick up the color socialblade girl want.
To check mine right now but i'm gonna go.
Ahead and pop out on the outer corner.
And marry that in too so a little bit on.
How i got into makeup actually the.
Instagram brow friend the faded look in.
The front started taking over and my.
Girlfriend who worked at mac at the time.
Was like hey if you're interested in.
Doing makeup i have a brow product that.
I think you would love to try but i went.
Ahead and i went over and she did one of.
My brows and i was like wow like i love.
This and then she gave me the pencil and.
She was like okay i did one and.
Go ahead and do the other one and so she.
Kind of like give me a little lesson.
That's really what inspired me to kind.
Of begin you know doing makeup and then.
From brows came lips came foundation and.
Then after that girl it was like a black.
Hole and now i just can't get enough of.
Makeup i'm gonna love it it's changed my.
Life.
Alright so now i'm gonna go ahead and.
Pick up an m 506 brush james has got us.
Covered in all departments this brush is.
Perfect for us.
Asian girls who have tiny eyes or.
Anybody got tiny eyes i kind of suffer.
Put a little bit of a hood so there's.
Gonna be perfect for tucking that shadow.
Deep into your socket and making it look.
Sickening and sketch so taking the m 506.
I'm gonna dip into the shade i love that.
And i'm gonna deepen up the pink blue.
And the green and we're gonna just carry.
It along and create a nice little window.
Shape so go ahead and tuck this shade.
Love that right above your mobile lid so.
You can create some power and intensity.
So that when you cut your crease.
It's nice and vibrant oh honey so i'm.
Gonna go ahead and repeat the same.
Process i'm gonna dip into the shade of.
Cola i'm gonna deepen up the dilution in.
The center so when i tell you that the.
Kids are not ready for this pigment.
We're gonna dip into the darkest green.
Color which is called daddy we're gonna.
Dip into the shade daddy and we're gonna.
Go ahead and open up the green on the.
Edges.
All right girls i'm gonna go ahead and.
Cut my crease now and hopefully that i'm.
Still this shade of tan when i come back.
Because holding your breath girl now go.
Ahead and do it off camera i'm gonna go.
Ahead and have some liner and it'll be.
Right back to finish up the lower lash.
All right sister so i went ahead and cut.
My crease with the m 124 and now i'm.
Placing the shade pinky be drinking tea.
On my lid and the cut so i can go ahead.
And set it and prep my provider and all.
The others dish that we're about to add.
So much super cool about this collection.
Of brushes that james is releasing with.
This palette is that he includes doubles.
Of each brush so say i just cut my.
Crease with this brush right here which.
Is the m 124 i would want to go in and.
Set with the same one because it's the.
Tiniest perfect little eyeshadow brush.
So i'm picking up the shaping can you.
Drinking it when i go ahead and do that.
So say if it only had one in here i.
Would have to go back in and clean my.
Brush just to do the same thing over.
Again so it's really cool and i really.
Appreciate that coming from.
Our distant point that there is another.
Russian here of the exact same one so.
That you can go ahead and use it in the.
Same look we're gonna make a little.
Switch to the brush and i'm gonna pick.
Up this morphe m or eight brush a little.
Bit more dense so we can pack on more.
Color boom we're back you guys so i went.
Ahead and winged my liner off-camera as.
Well as look like some flashes and a bit.
Of bling and now we're gonna go ahead.
And move on to a smokey on our under.
Eyes in order to do so i'm going to take.
06 so.
I'm gonna dip into the color playground.
I'm gonna go ahead and smoke that out.
Lightly to just kind of determine this.
Shape kind of just sketch out where i.
Want the color to be it was really easy.
For me especially to blow it out a.
Little too far so with this brush.
Precision is really easy which i really.
Like like i said i have really small.
Eyes so this is perfect for getting them.
Right under there and making it look.
Super nice and so the color looks good.
I'm pretty happy with it it's just a.
Light wash of color i'm just to.
Determine where i want to really make it.
Intense so i'm gonna go ahead and pick.
Up this brush right here which is the m2.
10 and i'm gonna pack on a lot of color.
To make it really intense and pop hey.
Guys i wanted to talk a little bit about.
My experiences as an influencer i mean.
I'm pretty new in the game but i have.
Had so many crazy opportunities just.
Like this one that i'm doing right now.
Actually this video is gonna be featured.
On james's channel it's really really.
Really inspired for me because i'm asian.
American and there isn't really very.
Much representation for us asians in the.
Community and i'm actually from laos but.
There isn't really much representation.
For laos or asian-americans really at.
All i think it's really cool that james.
Is giving me this opportunity and.
Morpheus giving me this opportunity to.
Kind of showcase my hardest street and.
Really like i don't know take it to the.
Next level i never would have thought in.
A million years that like i would be.
Here today like filming a video with.
Games's palette and you know even james.
Having a palette i mean he's paved the.
Way for the boys and makeup and it's.
Really cool and honestly like i can't.
Say it enough.
Inspiring it yeah i'm really really.
Grateful and i'm really happy to be here.
So i just wanted to tell you guys i.
Didn't give james a thank you all right.
So i'm not gonna go ahead and take my.
Morphe e36 it's a tiny little pencil.
Brush and i'm going to dip into the.
Shade of cola it's a dark blue and i'm.
Gonna go ahead and intensify and then.
I'm also gonna hop back into the m50 six.
And defect into playground i'm really.
Happy with how this looks.
And so now what i'm gonna do is i'm.
Gonna add a little bit of bling on my.
Lower lash line i love adding stone as.
You guys can see like i put a little.
Stone on my eyebrow and i'm gonna go.
Ahead and add a couple more and then.
We're gonna go ahead and add center.
Corner highlight as well so i go ahead i.
Have a little bit of blue on here i'm.
Gonna go ahead and place right in the.
Center my people you just an extra pop.
To your luck i think i'm gonna add one.
More just right below that as well to.
Kind of give like a little tear effect.
But i love it it's kind of signature to.
Me i guess i'm bling to my face so we're.
Gonna go ahead and add some inner corner.
Highlight now to add some light to our.
Inner corner so i'm gonna dip into the.
Shade hello which is a shimmery blue.
We're gonna go ahead into some of our.
More feet setting spray and just missed.
It a couple times so that we can get.
Like a super shimmery effect we're gonna.
Go ahead you guys see that oh my god so.
Pretty i'm gonna go ahead and pop this.
Neon pink liner into my lower lash line.
To really set off so i'm gonna take this.
More feet m 518 brush it's a brow brush.
But i'm gonna use it for my lower lashes.
And i'm gonna take the shape of skip and.
Set the pink cream that we just put in.
The waterline with be shadow alright you.

Look i mean it's a really colorful.
Rainbow cut crease i'm gonna go ahead.

Watercolor i don't know kind of fun and.
Glitzy and glamorous with a little bit.
Of bling i absolutely love the palette.
It's extremely blendable super creamy.
And ultra pigmented i came up you guys.
To get your hands on it honestly it's.
Probably one of the best murphy palettes.

Showgirl they're shaking in their booth.
Okay girl so don't forget to follow me.
On all my social media it's at zachary.
Bangs the sdk is that really kay and.
Yeah thank you so much for joining me i.
Hope you enjoyed this little tutorial.
And we will see you very soon bye hey.
Guys it's jake.
That's raging on instagram and i just.
Recreated the look i use for james's.
Campaign shoot so if you want to see how.
I did this keep on watching so i'm gonna.
Be priming using the mac soft ochre.
Paint pot using an m 2 to 4 brush just.
To prime my eyes so how i met james was.
A lot of people don't know this unless.
You do but i was his first-ever fan page.
So that's like where we met pretty much.
And then he just inspired me to make my.
Own makeup page and i never really.
Thought that i would like be where it is.
Today.
He helped me grow faster he this is.
Hoping a lot of ways giving me a lot of.
Like opportunities i never thought i.
Would get and i just wanna thank him for.
That.
James has inspired me to do a lot of how.
The ordinary looks.
That's probably why i've grown a little.
Faster it's because the looks i've done.
Aren't like a lot of like everyday looks.
It's always something that is.
Eye-catching i think it was something.
Different that no one has seen so i'm.
Gonna be studying the mac over paint pot.
With a powder just so.
And so i don't get any but yeah i was.
Saying i was james's first fan page.
Which is kind of embarrassing now but.
Honestly to me not really because it got.
Me where i am today i'll always support.
Them still and it's just amazing how you.
Can go from being something so little to.
Something so big like i'm from a small.
Town and i never thought i'd be working.
With something so big and being friends.
With someone and such a big spotlight.
And it's just amazing that that can.
Happen i'm gonna be using a morphia amp.
Or for one so i'm gonna be dipping into.
The sky blue sheet and i'm just gonna op.
That like i'm right in the crease and.
Then just start to blend that out to.
Deepen that out i'm going to be using.
The morphe m or three three and i'm.
Gonna be dipping into the slightly.
Darker blue just to add some depth in.
The crease i'm gonna go back in with.
That morphe m4 4-1 and blend out that.
Deeper color to deepen that even more.
I'm going with the darker blue and i'm.
Just gonna do i'm gonna be cutting the.
Crease using the mac soft ochre paint.
Pot again and a morphe two to four i'm.
Gonna be applying this light blue.
Shimmery shade onto the aoi all over.
There i'm gonna go back in with the.
First shade we used which was that.
Lighter blue that like sky-blue now i'm.
Just gonna put it right in here to start.
To blend that a line.
Go ahead and just use the access shadow.
From that first shade we use just and i.
Just for a little bit of debt i'm gonna.
Go in with a little bit of block using.
The morphe and four five six now to.
Start off the bottom lower lash line i'm.
Gonna use pretty much the same steps we.
Used for the top going from the lightest.
Blue to the darkest blue i'm gonna grab.
That transition shade again that blue.
And i'm gonna grab more and four three.
Three going with the next shade which is.
A little darker than the fair shade a.
Little closer to the lash line and then.
Going in with the darker blue shade.
We're gonna mix it with the black and.
Then plane right on the lower lash line.
Just having it right in there to finish.
This i like i'm gonna grab me the morphe.
Color pencil and shake coconut and i'm.
Just going to pop that in the waterline.
So that is what i all complete and now.
I'm gonna go finish the other one off.
Camera and then we're gonna come back.
And do the neck piece we're back that's.
Full theis complete i just thrown some.
Lashes to complete guys but now we're.
Gonna highlight the inner corner and it.
Just completes the look honestly so now.
We're gonna do my out so i can start on.
The neck piece for the neck piece you're.
Gonna need some bigger brushes and some.
Smaller brushes just so we can lay down.
The first shade and then using the.
Smaller brushes to add more depth and.
Dimension when adding the clouds i'm.
Just gonna dip into pretty much the same.
Thing as we did on the eyes just like.
Adding the color onto the neck and just.
Laying it on there oh and i'm using the.
Morphe and 405 so once we have that.
First color on i'm gonna dip into this.
Lighter darker blue and just like.
Throwing it on.
Anywhere right now you just want some.
Darker spots and then we're gonna add.
More darker spots and right after we're.
Gonna apply the white - oh and the brush.
I'm using to apply this color is the e43.
To further deepen out those areas i'm.
Gonna take a morphe and by 10 and then.
I'm gonna dip into it through blue just.
A little bit of the black going back and.
Forth between those colors i'm just.
Gonna be using a little bit more of that.
Sky blue shadow and just popping it.
Right where we had it the middle so now.
I'm just gonna be adding that pigna i.
Used on the inner corner all over the.
Neck just so it gives some really pretty.
Effect i'm going to be taking the morphe.
M5 town dipping into that people so now.
We're going to be adding the clouds on.
The neck and i'm just gonna be dipping.
Into this white shade in the jamestown.
And will be packing on in a cloud shade.
This white is probably the most.
Pigmented why i've ever used it's so.
Good and so pigmented and just to.
Brighten out my highlight i'm gonna be.
Taking a highlighter from morphe this is.
An extra and i'm gonna so this is.
Complete i'm just gonna set my face with.
Some preference.
Music.
We're done and this looks amazing thanks.
To the james pallet this took a while.
But it's done it looks good the pigment.
Is so good so blues for me are very hard.
To blend just in my opinion and this.
Blended like a dream like look at that i.
Don't know if you can see that but i can.
See that.
And it's so blended and the shadows just.
Performed so good the white was.
Phenomenal.
Like this palette you need and the blue.
Shades are just so good in like do you.
See that ask for the brush get this look.
I had to use so many different brushes.
And that can't had it all so genius.
Different sizes and trios duo's of like.
The same brush just genius and i'm.
Pretty sure you can create any look with.
This kit and this palette and that's it.

Little bit of my story and a little bit.
Of my background as you know a boy in.

That so if you guys want to learn how to.
Get this eye look make sure you guys.
Continue to watch i am honestly so.

The more three times james charles.
Palette i'm just so honored to even be.
Doing this and so grateful so thank you.
James he actually reached out to me last.
Minute.
And create this on kind of nervous and.
I'm kind of like i don't know what to do.
But today i think i'm gonna use some red.
On my eyelid and just you know wing it.
And try to figure it out as i go but i.
Know i'm gonna use red and then i'm.
Gonna tell you guys about my story if.
You guys want to hear about more of me.
Make sure you guys watch this let's get.
Started so today i'm gonna be priming my.
Eyelids actually because i heard that.
The eyeshadows actually worked really.
Well with the eyelid primer usually i.
Use concealer like james so this is kind.
Of different for me but you know hey.
Let's give it a shine they're trying you.
Know i'm using the m22 for morphe brush.
To like you know basically just a base.
On my eyelid you always use a lighter.
Color so that a shadow can just show up.
More cuz it also is a little bit harder.
For darker skin tones to like shadows to.
Show up but we're about to see how this.
Works i always use the lighter so look.
It just like the vibrant as it can so i.
Have my eyelid primed and now i'm just.
Gonna go straight into this color this.
Palette is actually so cool because it's.
So like big i don't know if this is like.
Huge like look like bigger than my face.
So i'm gonna go straight into the red.
With you're kidding with another morphe.
Brush from james's collection to m 4-3-3.
Brush and i'm just gonna start putting.
This on my eyelid.
Hopefully the best but this is like a.
True red and i chose the color red it's.
Kind of hard for me like to talk you.
Know lynn but i chose the color red on.
My just for this look is because i'm.
Actually hiv positive so when i i just.
Felt like you know just was spitting to.
That because you know with like red.
Products and all that kind of stuff and.
Just like you know hiv so i just wanted.
To do is red and then i wanted to do.
The ellis casino to tie into this i have.
My whole story on actually on youtube.
That's my story about like this why i.
Chose red and the reason i got into.
Makeup was because makeup was kind of.
Like my calm or like the storm that was.
Going around me and like there was just.
So much just like going on in my life so.
At the time i just like picked up makeup.
And just like started going in with it.
And having fun with it you can just give.
Me something to do and like just really.
Grounded me and it just turned into me.
Just a wee makeup all the time and now i.
Do like instagram videos and all that.
Kind of stuff and then just nightmare.
Which is kind of amazing.
And i'm just gonna bring this out a.
Little bit dramatic because the name of.
This palette is unleash your inner.
Artist and i couldn't want to just do.
Something dramatic and kind of you know.
Not to be so simple playing game today.
So i'm gonna kind of drag it out so if.
It looks crazy right now just trust the.
Process and it will come all together.
I'm gonna take i believe it's called.
Mary i'm gonna blend that into the top.
So kim like you see i'll just like blend.
In with that eye and to give it a little.
Bit more of like depth i'm going to use.
Deke i'm going to just kind of like go.
Like right here on my it's like my.
Eyelid bone and just kind of like give.
It some dimension in our depth there's.
Something like this so it's gonna be a.
Little bit darker okay so now that we.
Have the base kind of finished i think.
I'm going to take now like a shimmer red.
So i'm gonna do this shade shook and i.
Think i'm gonna use my finger and pack.
That right on to the lid as i feel like.
That look really pretty.
Alright so i'm gonna go to the shade.
Acapella i'm just gonna it's much of.
Blue and.
31 brush blending and dragging it all.
Off and it's kind of like turning into a.
Purple but i like how dramatic this blue.
Is like right under the eye now i'm.
Gonna put something a little bit lighter.
In the inner corner just to bring a.
Little bit more light to the eye and not.
Look so dark and you know just bring a.
Little life to you there's a lot of like.

This morphe m 224 flat brush and this is.
What i'm gonna use to pack on the primer.
I'm taking the m45 6 brush and i'm gonna.
Dip into the color escape which is a.
Very deep purple and i'm gonna pick up a.
Little bit and then tap the excess off.
And then i'm gonna start from right here.
Just a little bit and do you see how.
Pigmented this shadow is and you only.
Need it like a little bit and it's.
Already so so pigmented like i just.
Dipped it once and that was it i'm gonna.
Go in with another brush this is a am 41.
Brush it's just a flip of your brush and.
I just like to take this and i like to.
Blend the purple up now with the same.
Morphe and a four or five six brush i'm.
Gonna take a playground which is a.
Lighter blue and i'm gonna add it.
Right here so i'm creating like a.
Rainbow but i'm doing it backwards and.
Don't worry if it doesn't look blended.
Yet i just like to focus the shadow.
Right here first and then we go back and.
Blend everything out words you can.
Already see i only did my brush in one.
Time and it was already so so pigmented.
Now i'm gonna go back in the width and.
For for one brush and just blend the.
Blue up with no additional product so.
Why i like color a lot i was always.
Really sad so when i started doing.
Makeup color really helped me become.
More happy and when i do a colorful look.
I just i'm just so happy i am taking the.
Morphe m45 six brush and i'm using.
Social blade and i'm putting this right.
Here next to the blue and then i'm.
Blending it upwards towards my brow now.
What's really cool about the james and.
Morphe brush collection is that you're.
Not getting only one of each brush.
You're getting multiples so in the first.
Collection you are getting i believe.
It's three of the m45 six brushes and as.
Someone who does rainbow looks who does.
Multiple colors on one eye i need.
Multiple brushes so this collection.
Really does come in handy for an artist.
Like myself so again i'm taking the.
Morphe and four-five-six brush this is a.
Really good brush as you guys can tell.
I've been using it throughout the whole.
Entire video and i'm gonna dip into the.
Yellow it's called b as you guys can.
Tell i also struggle with acne and just.
Being open and vulnerable about that i.
Get a lot of people that tell me that.
That has helped them for james to ask me.
To do this on his like platform makes me.
Happy because it's a message that's very.
Important to be inclusive to all skin.
Types and all skin tones so i'm very.
Happy and acne is normal and skin.
Positivity is something that we should.
Always push through i know i'm not the.
Only one that struggles with acne and if.
You are someone that struggles with acne.
No you're not you're beautiful and i.
Hope that in some sort of way i hope you.
So i'm just gonna go back in a little.
Bit with socialblade in between you want.
To go back in with the colors just so.
They can blend together i don't feel.
Like i necessarily have to do that just.
Because they're blending if you guys can.
See they're blending all together very.
Perfectly so i don't even really have to.
Go back and blend good so i'm gonna go.
Into some oranges and i'm going to mix.
Two i'm gonna make spy 18 and arrest it.
Rusted is more of like a deeper orange.
But i want to mix them because i just.
Want them to create like a darker orange.
If that makes sense now i'm using the.
Same morphe m45 six brush and this color.
I'm gonna put it on that outer portion.
Of my eye just a little bit so i'm going.
To go ahead and anchor my crease i'm.
Gonna give myself like i have cookies.
You guys can use whatever concealer you.
Want i'm just gonna take my own and do.
That so i just cut my crease and i.
Stopped right here and i'm going to add.
The red i'm going to take this morphe.
M56 tooth brush and i'm gonna dip in.
Just a little bit and i'm going to pack.
It on right here in the outer portion of.
The eye and the artistry palette i was.
Really happy that he included a white.
And a black because i use a lot of white.
Shadow i like using white in my inner.
Corner i feel like it makes everything.
Pop but today i'm going to use that not.
Only in my inner corner it fits on my.
Lid so i'm taking this m 224 flat brush.
And so i loaded my brush and i'm gonna.
Pat in this white right here so i'm.
Going to take a little bit of pink which.
Is called skip and this morphe e36 brush.
It's very tiny and i'm going to add this.
Pink right here and that's just because.
I wanted to use the pink in this palette.
It's really really pretty and as you.
Guys can see it's super super pigmented.
And i'm just gonna add it right here by.
The red and then.
Blend it with the red just a little bit.
I'm gonna go ahead and remove the tape.
You should get like a really nice clean.
Cut like that so i'm gonna take the.
Morphe and 3-2-1 brush and i'm gonna.
Take skip which is the pink and i'm.
Gonna add it right here on the waterline.
So i'm going to take you're kidding on.
The morphe e36 brush and just blend this.
Down here just a little bit i don't want.
A lot so one of my signature lips that's.
My inner corner store and i buy these.
And michael's you can get them at any.
Arts and crafts stores but i get my own.
Scent michael i'd like to take some.
Tweezers and i will pop it right in my.
Inner corner like this this is james.
Palliate has a white which makes me.
Really happy i'm gonna use that white.
And put it in my inner corner so i like.
To use like a really bulky brush when it.
Comes to like my inner corner star i am.
Using the morphe 173 brush this is also.
In james's brush collection so i like to.
Do this thing where i tap in and press.
Down on the inner corner store i like to.
Press down the shadow so i'm taking some.
Tweezers and then i like to remove it.
You should get a stamp like that in your.
Inner corner so this is the completed.
Look i'm gonna go ahead and add some.
Mascara some lashes and then finish this.
Eye and i will be right back.
Music.
Alright guys so this is the completed.
Look i did want to touch a little bit on.
The palate and my thoughts on it so i.
Mean right away it's really pigmented i.
Work with color so i know what like i.
Know what i like and i know what i want.
From a palette and this is definitely a.
Palette that i would use over and over.
Again the purple was really good.
Purple's are not my favorite and this.
Purple was actually really solid and it.
Blended really really well the blues and.
The greens were really really nice.
Greens i always have like an issue it.
Just because i feel like sometimes some.
Greens from some brands are like too.
Dark this one gives me like almost like.
A very green lime neon kind of feel so i.
Really like that and then yellows are.
Really really important you can tell if.
The palette is good if it has like a.
Really great bright yellow so i really.
Like the yellow in this palette oranges.
Are always like formulated really really.
Nice so i really like the orange and.
Then the reds and the pink's they're.
Just so good they're so pigmented and.
Just overall i really like the palette.
