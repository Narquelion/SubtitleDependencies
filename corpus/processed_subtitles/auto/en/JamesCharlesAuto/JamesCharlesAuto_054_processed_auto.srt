Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel so.
You may be wondering why my hair is not.
Styled and pooped up like normal and why.
I'm wearing this very fancy wake up up.
On my head today and for today's video.
We're gonna doing a drag tutorial i've.
Only done drag a few times on my.
Instagram page but they've all been.
Looks at i've been super super proud of.
And every time i do post one as well.
Literally all the comments are what are.
You doing a video when are you filming a.
Video we want to know how to do this so.
For today's video i sat down and i'm.
Gonna teach you guys how to go from this.
To this i have a ton of products here in.
Front of me and ironically enough most.
Of them are actually part of my everyday.
Makeup routine dry makeup doesn't have.
To be some crazy expensive art you can.
Totally use the products you have at.
Home just in a different style that you.
Might not think of obviously i am not a.
Dry queen you guys know i am a makeup.
Artist and i definitely cannot perform.
Or dance on stage that is for    sure.
But 50% of drag is the whole aesthetic.
Behind edit is a very very cool and.
Beautiful art form so without further.
Ado if you would like to see it mia.
Transform into a drag queen and just.
Test out some driving makeup today make.
Sure you keep on watching alright so.
Some drag queens have their eyebrows.
Shaven up but of course i have a very.
Very bushy brows so our first step today.
Is going to be to cover them up all.
You're gonna use the classic elmer's.
Glue stick a spoolie and then a wet.
Towel i'm basically just taking my glue.
Stick and running this all throughout my.
Eyebrows and i'm going super hard as.
Well i want a ton of glue to get on.
There especially for the first layer i'm.
Gonna grab my spoolie brush and i'm.
Gonna pull my skin up and i'm just going.
To really really roughly go through that.
Brow and brush all the hairs upwards.
It's really importantly you do a good.
Job spooling through these and brushing.
Them all the way upwards flat to your.
Face because once you add a lot of.
Layers of glue you will be able to a.
Powder and foundation right over them.
And hopefully the goal this will.
Obviously be that there is no texture.
And you can't see them at all so you.
Really have to make sure that the brow.
Covering process is done it's super.
Super efficiently and then once it's all.
Comb through i just wet the corner of.
This towel and then i always like to go.
Around the hairs and just kind of wipe.
Away the extra of glue.
Having the least amount of glue possible.
The better but obviously you need to.
Cover them depending on how thick your.
Bronzer and mine are super super thick.
So i always like to wipe away the glue.
Around the edges so therefore the glue.
It's only on the brow and not on the.
Skin it because that creates unwanted.
Texture it later on so by the time that.
This eyebrow.
Flew down and cleaned up this bra is now.
Completely dry so we can go on to the.
Next layer so for this layer once again.
I'm gonna grab my glue stick and i'm.
Just gonna press really really hard on.
To the actual hairs and i'm gonna make.
Sure to really kind of dig this into my.
Forehead as well because once we put the.
Glue on this layer we are gonna spoolie.
Through it because that's just going to.
Interrupt the layer beforehand so from.
Now on we're just going to layer over.
Top and then clean it up and we're gonna.
Repeat this exact process probably three.
Or four times until we have four layers.
Of glue total and then we'll go on to.
The next step.
All right so this is four layers of glue.
Completely packed on there and dry and.
The next step is gonna be to go in with.
Cody err some powder and a powder puff.
And pack those brows down i'm gonna take.
Their powder puffs and i'm gonna dip.
Into quite a lot of powder just dust the.
Excess off.
Coughing it because we all know what.
This smells like and then i'm going to.
Pack it into my brows i'm definitely not.
Going to be worrying about fallout.
Because we can always brush it away but.
Basically this powder is going to really.
Set the brows in place make sure that.
That glue is 100% set and then also fill.
In any areas that texture is still left.
Which makes them super super smooth and.
Ready to cover with foundation for.
Foundation today i'm going to be using.
My new favorite crumble that i've been.
Telling you guys about and that is the.
Make up for ever ultra hd and the too.
Faced born this day foundation.
I am in the shade @y at 325 in this one.
And then natural beige and the two-faced.
One i'm just gonna go in and i'm going.
To go over the brows first and i'm just.
Going to press that foundation in there.
Pretty hard to really fill in all the.
Places and you see how that brow is now.
Completely covered and that's spooky i'm.
Actually gonna let this foundation start.
To set in place and dry down just a.
Little bit before i go into my full face.
And while i do that i'm gonna go to the.
Makeup forever pro sculpting palette and.
I'm going to color cracks just gonna.
Grab any normal packing brush and go.
Into this orange shade and then rub it.
All over my beard area i definitely get.
A pretty bad 5 o'clock shadow now that.
I'm thinking about it i probably should.
Have color corrected my eyebrows to.
Being that they are a blue toned hair.
Just like all hair and body is so i was.
Pretty done with me but i guess we're.
Just going to color correct the beard.
And pray that the eyebrows get decent.
Coverage basically i want to put this.
Consider anywhere where i normally have.
Darkness or a body hair growing i.
Definitely get a lot of hair on my chin.
Massage area and then in my.
Sideburns and then i definitely get a.
Lot of darkness underneath my eyes from.
Barely sleeping from editing all night.
Long but basically the orange tones that.
The concealer are going to cancel out.
The blue tones of the darkness which.
Just furthers the illusion let's i can.
See those all in there and blend it out.
I'm just gonna go end up my makeup.
Forever stick once again and just cover.
It over my entire face i'm definitely.
Putting a lot of this on and going full.
Coverage tonight this is definitely not.
A natural everyday look by any means.
This is literally the most horrifying.
Look ever max i'm gonna go to light our.
Shave tape in the shade light and just.
Highlight my face like i said we are not.
Going for a natural look in any means.
For today so i'm definitely packing a.
Lot of product on i know a lot of drag.
Queens like doing a cream contouring 14.
Or makeup for me cream contouring is.
Just something that i'm not really a fan.
Of so i am gonna be doing all powder.
Contouring today but that is totally up.
To personal preference you can do.
Whatever you want if you wanted to do.
Cream contouring and now would be the.
Time to do it before we get into powder.
And the next step and then once again.
I'm gonna grab my coat here some powder.
And a powder puff and we're going to.
Pack the powder on today.
Flashback mary here we come i'm gonna.
Start by setting underneath my eyes.
Because that's we're gonna get the most.
Amount of creases and then i'm gonna.
Really pack the powder into my nose.
Because you're gonna be contouring it a.
Lot today.
And i really want to make sure that the.
Foundation and concealer stay on there.
And don't wear off same thing when it.
Comes to the eyebrows i'm just gonna be.
Really really gentle as well because we.
Don't want to take off any of that.
Product that we already layer down are.
Also gonna start peeking back through to.
Contour my face today i'm gonna use.
Shocking my kat von d shade and light.
Palette i'm gonna use my brophy m 405.
Brush and dip into the left and middle.
Shade and i'm just gonna go in and test.
Out my face i usually cover from about.
Here down to the corner of my mouth but.
For actual drag makeup i'm gonna contour.
Starting at the top of my sideburn and.
Then i'm gonna go and draw a like more.
Curved line kind of ending more up here.
Instead that just gonna really raise my.
Cheekbones and give them more of a.
Feminine appearance obviously there's no.
Exact way we're gonna do drag you can.
Put your face however you want you can.
Contour however you want and i know.
There's no exact male or female face.
Shape that we need to follow i'm just.
Doing it based on these standards that.
People usually do follow when it comes.
To contouring the jaw line similar to.
The cheek bone i am gonna do something a.
Little bit different to make everything.
Look more saw.
I'm actually going to chisel up my.
Jawline starting at the corner here and.
Kind of rounding this out a little bit.
Just to get my face some more stock and.
Once again feminine appearance when it.
Comes to my notes to contour it you.
Sisters already know that i love a good.
Chiseled out pinched ass.
Nose so for today's like i'm just gonna.
Do the same exact thing just a little.
Bit more intense.
Finally to finish off the base i'm just.
Gonna go in with my benefit hoola.
Bronzer in my murphy m five to seven.
Brush and i'm just gonna use this.
Bronzer to kind of blend together the.
Contour and highlight and make.
Everything at nice and bronzy and.
Connected same exact thing outcode.
Here's a powder eye powder puff one last.
Time you guys know that i stopped baking.
My face and my normal makeup routine a.
Very very long time ago when i moved to.
California i just thought that it wasn't.
Really necessary anymore and i much.
Preferred the more glowy dewy foundation.
Look but when it comes to drag makeup.
Baking is absolutely necessary.
It definitely locks the face in place.
Because these queens that are doing this.
Makeup on a nightly basis are gonna be.
Performing on stage under a whole lot of.
Lights and dancing and sweating so it.
Really makes sure all the foundation.
Stays on and also using the translucent.
Powder intensifies all the highlights.
That we use with our concealer earlier.
Which just makes the makeup have a lot.
More dimension and just look better in.
In general.
Alright so brace yourself because drive.
Brows are by far the most complicated.
Part of drag makeup and even after doing.
Look several several times and being a.
Professional makeup artist it is still.
So hard for me to keep my brows perfect.
And symmetrical but we're going to try.
Of course so today i'm gonna be using.
The benefit curb brow and i'm using the.
Shade and number three to match my wig.
And then i'm just gonna use any old.
Anchor brush and this is the makeup.
Shock t-55 okay so i just grabbed a.
Little bit of product on my angle brush.
And i'm just gonna start sketching them.
And so i'm basically gonna start my brow.
At the bottom of my normal brow i want.
My new brown to be in the exact same.
Starting position as my old one so.
Therefore they look natural and i'm just.
Gonna draw them a whole lot more arched.
Than my normal everyday brows and a.
Little bit thinner too.
Once they have the bottom line of the.
Brow all lined up i like to donna start.
At the outside and make the tail then i.
Always like to draw that upper brow and.
Right about here and then just connect.
Him well if they have those brows all.
Lined in and pretty much filled up i.
Like to take just the side of the brush.
And go in and start to pack that product.
Forward to create a natural ombre once.
Their ombre now i'm gonna go back to the.
Very original angle brush being the t-55.
From makeup shock and dip it to this.
Dark brown shading it right up in here.
And just create some brown strokes as.
Always with my normal brows i'm gonna.
Grab a little bit more shaped tube.
Concealer once again in the shade light.
And then at my morphe 43 brush and just.
Clean them up with any excess consider.
I'm just going to prime and set my.
Eyelids and get ready for eye shadow.
Okay so now that the brows are all.
Complete you can take a major deep.
Breath because the rest is all smooth.
Sailing from here so fresh titled like i.
Said i'll be using the jacqueline hale.
Pill and i'm gonna start off using my.
Makeup shock t4 brush and dipping into.
This neutral tone a brown shade right up.
In here and just lightly dusting that in.
My crease i'm gonna be cutting out my.
Crease today so i'm gonna be putting.
This just slightly above if you guys.
Have followed me for a while you've.
Probably seen all the job looks that.
I've done there really hasn't been that.
Many of them in the first place.
But i used to do a really really really.
Intense style outdrive makeup that.
Really was never flattering to my face.
Everyone would always tweet them when i.
Posted them saying i look like.
The dragon from shrek which yes i'll.
Give you that they're definitely dead i.
Recently just discovered a brazilian.
Drag queen ever named pablo avatar that.
I am literally obsessed with he's so.
Pretty he's also a musician so like a.
True freaking sister because makeup is.
Very very natural and not very intense.
Even for being a drag queen so as soon.
As i saw him i was so inspired to test.
This out and if you guys follow me on.
Sap which if you don't you definitely.
Need to i tried out this look a few.
Nights ago and everybody was kind of.
Shook over i was took over i was so.
Happy about turned on so i definitely.
Wanted to film a tutorial for you guys.
I'm using a burnt orange shade on my.
Makeup shock t-33 brush to blend out and.
Deepen it.
Our part of the crease then with that.
Same exact brush i'm going to grab this.
Medium tone brown up in here and then.
Deep in and out even more i'm gonna take.
A quick break for my eye shadow for a.
Second and grab these steel at liquid.
Metals and this is in the shade of.
Kitten karma i'm just gonna use this to.
Carve up my entire eyelid by going.
Slightly right above the crease i'm just.
Gonna close my eyes then fan my eyes to.
Let this dry i am gonna be going back in.
With more shadow and liquid liner in.
Just like it and i don't want this.
Glitter to transfer anywhere to do.
Anyway later today i'm gonna use my wet.
N wild mega liner obviously in the shade.
Of black so basically for the winged.
Liner we're keeping the same technique.
As normal just making it a whole lot.
Bigger and thicker now the liner is all.
On andrea i'm gonna go back in with my.
233 brush one last time and actually dip.
Into it the black shade in the jaclyn.
Hill palette and just darken out the.
Outer corners i'm blending this black.
Bolt into the crease add into the.
Glitter as well for the lower lash line.
I'm going to start off by lining my.
Waterline using my nyx epic wonder.
Pencil.
Then i got my morphe r43 brush and dip.
Into this warm tone brown up in here and.
Start to defiant the lash line when i.
Get to this inner corner i'm actually.
Not gonna follow my natural eye shape.
And i'm going to make this kind of more.
A straight line to create the effect of.
A new inner corner then are just gonna.
Take my morphe m4 33 brush and dip into.
This a warm tone of orange here and just.
Blend that out last thing i'm gonna.
Actually use a custom pair of stock.
Lashes that i made earlier on and that.
Is the combination of the makeup shack.
Matte eye lashes and my 301's.
Now normally i would use just a few.
01 stock which are literally.
Humongous as you can see they're like a.
Freakin butterfly wing so this is a more.
Toned down version of drag these are the.
Perfect combination of lashes if you.
Look closely as well my lash in the.
Inner corner is glued down to the inner.
Corner as it goes out to the outer lash.
Line and my lashes actually glued.
Nowhere near my lash line it's probably.
Actually a good half an inch away from.
My outer corner and the end of the lash.
Is actually sitting in the middle of the.
Liner this looks pretty weird close-up.
And you definitely don't have to do it.
By any means but from far away gluing.
The lashes up more just helps lift the.
Entire face and really gives you like a.
Snatched look that just looks so so good.
Like i said i'm just gonna take my.
Roller lash mascara and just dip in a.
Little bit and i'm going to connect my.
Regular lashes with these huge ass fake.
Ones.
I'm sorry gonna show the ones in the.
Outer course are very very coated and.
Nice and black so they blend into the.
Liner and the lashes because if there's.
Any powder on them like you can see it.
Right now it's really gonna mess up the.
Illusion of having those lashes glue it.
Why higher up if you do decide to do.
That for highlighter today of course.
What else do we used in the anasazi.
Estelle hollywood illuminator in my.
Morphe m 501 brush.
Ooh pheromone is shaking are you kidding.
Me we've been baking for like an hour.
Now so i'm gonna go ahead and wipe this.
Away oh and see how that just made that.
Cut so nice oh yes.
Using my morphe m4 3-1 i'm also going to.
Highlight lino's you definitely be very.
Very careful in highlighting as well.
Because a nose contour highlight can.
Definitely make or break a drag look and.
You definitely ought to be super snatch.
Is possible so i'm also gonna grab a.
Flat top brush and i'm going to.
Highlight my brow bone today now this is.
Your first time doing drag i definitely.
Would not recommend doing this because.
Highlighting obviously adds and this is.
A texture to any area and if this is.
Your first time covering a brows unless.
You are some miracle worker because lord.
Knows that took me a whole lot of.
Practice they might look a little bit.
Texture for the first time it just takes.
A whole lot of practice but once you get.
Really good at covering your brows and.
They're nice and flat like this one is.
Even this one's a little bit wonky but.
This one's nice and flat see how that.
Bra how they just look so good yes for.
My lips today i'm gonna start off with.
The mac lip pencil in the shade of whirl.
And just over line them a lot.
So we definitely went way overboard with.
The overlining but that is definitely.
The point dragon makeup is super super.
Over accentuated and just big and.
Beautiful in general so i'm next in with.
The oprah south paolo liquid lipstick.
And just fill everything in for some.
Nice juicy for luxurious lips and last.
But certainly not least i'm gonna set my.
Face in place using my urban decay all.
Nighter setting spray.
Alright guys so that has to look all.
Complete but we all know the drag is a.
Whole lot more than just makeup so i'm.
Gonna go ahead and change it up and.
Quickly put on the wig and i'll be right.
Back with the finished look alright guys.
So this is the no makeup natural.
Everyday woman total complete just.
Kidding obviously this is a very very.
Full intense struggle and i absolutely.
Love how this turned out as you guys saw.
I pretty much did use all of my everyday.
Makeup products that are using most of.
My looks there's been a very different.
And more intense way and this is the dry.
