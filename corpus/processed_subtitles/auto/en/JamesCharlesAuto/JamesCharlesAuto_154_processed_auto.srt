Video as many of you sisters now i have.
A severe addiction to starbucks i start.
Off my day every single morning with a.
Venti finca tea drink a tea with my ice.
And also a slice a pumpkin bread i feel.
Like for a very very long time people.
Thought it was just like part of my.
Brand to snapchat it all the time but no.
Literally every single day i'm obsessed.
With it i'm addicted and i've been.
Posting about it for a very very long.
Time too to try to get a brand deal and.
Alas here we are today still without.
Wine fun facts for you guys it actually.
Used to be on the starbucks secret menu.
As just a strawberry honestly refresher.
But you how to add coconut milk to it.
But after i started posting about it and.
So many of you sisters started ordering.
It.
They literally added it to the permanent.
Menu like we actually did that which i.
Think is so cool this morning i rolled.
Out of bed and was craving a pink drink.
As always but i really was feeling lazy.
And did not want to leave the house and.
I thought to myself i bet i can make.
This myself right here at home so for.
Today's video i thought i'll be so much.
Fun to come downstairs to the kitty.
Kitchen and see if i could recreate my.
Starbucks order that i get every single.
Day from scratch let's get started all.
Right you guys i have a bunch of.
Ingredients in front of me are ready to.
Get started on our pumpkin bread today.
I'm gonna do that first i can pop it in.
The oven and then work on at the pinky.
Drinka tea which speaking of for this.
Video i am wearing my custom pinky.
Drinking hoodie that was made for me by.
To my fan pages.
Zoey and brooke i love you guys the.
Absolute most but i do have something a.
Little bit more sister special to put on.
Over top and that is.
My a pride hi welcome to starbucks what.
Can i get started for you a lot of my.
Ingredients.
I do have an actual spice of a pumpkin.
Bread up from starbucks so you can use.
It as a reference add lopez as you can.
See our loop has a beautiful thick slice.
Cut out of it.
We do love a thick sister and is a.
Beautiful warm tone smoky pumpkin color.
With a darkened soft crust there's also.
Some pistachio flake some peas.
It's pumpkin really it's not for sachi i.
Was the expert on all things not related.
So we're trying to recreate this exact.
Loaf today so our first step we are go.
Ahead and preheated our oven to 350.
Degrees and she's in the back heating up.
For a real one and now we have our large.
Mixing bowl for my mini kitchen and that.
We are going to mix our dry ingredients.
Into so first we need 1 and 12 cups of.
All-purpose flour really shove your.
Measuring cup in there how do i get it.
Full so there's one ich cup of flour and.
Now we have our half a cup 1 teaspoon of.
Baking soda that smells strong oh wow ok.
1 teaspoon of ground nutmeg cinnamon.
Without cinnamon challenge let's go.
Ladies pasta i thought it was so easy i.
Just swallowed it it looks so good.
Yatta is one teaspoon of cinnamon 1.
Teaspoon of ground what the clove.
That sounds very strong it will just.
Look a little bit less than a teaspoon.
Of us i don't like this we have to use.
Baking powder too.
I'm already bored how about teaspoon of.
Salt the covers on there's a lid on it.
First of all i'm not stupid.
Oh we need to do this in separate bowls.
I took a lot of work i'm gonna transfer.
This powder mixture over to this bowl.
Because i need to beat my other things.
Together in this one now i have to beat.
The eggs white sugar brown sugar and.
Vanilla extract in a large bowl of an.
Electric mixer on high speed until.
Combined about 30 seconds we're gonna.
Crack four eggs why well i am a.
Professional who'd ever get a cell in.
There 1 cup of pure white sugar 1 14.
Cup of light brown sugar.
How are you kidding 12 teaspoon of.
Vanilla extracts that's like another -.
Now we put it together we're gonna mix.
It at high speed for 30 seconds being.
Pumpkin and oil oh oh god open this no.
Now we're gonna lower this down and lock.
It and sorry i'll put a slow-speed we're.
Gonna start beating this in and now.
We're going to add 34 cup of our oil 1.
For our powder mixture until it's.
Blended and smooth this is too hard.
Whoo now it's getting nice and thick.
It's let me like it's about done oh my.
God it actually looks so good i'm a.
Personal baker if you didn't know okay.
Now we're going to take our batter of.
Our pumpkin loaf cake when important.
Nice and good oh it looks so good i'm.
Gonna use it this good spoon it's really.
Scoop the excess out of here now we're.
Gonna grab our pumpkin seeds because we.
Need to sprinkle them on top so it.
Creates that nice crunchy crust on the.
Bread this ziplock bag and we're going.
To put our pumpkin seeds in there and.
Now we're just gonna take this rolling.
Pin and really crunch it off what.
Somebody your pumpkin powder.
We're sprinkle this right on top i know.
I'm even thinking steak right none of.
You are now 70 minutes all right you.
Guys now that our pumpkin bread is all.
Ready to go and nice and coated we're.
Going to pop this in the oven at 350.
Degrees for 70 minutes i thought this.
Was gonna be a quick video to film i was.
Wrong are we surprised no we're.
Basically gonna let this cook until the.
Top is a dark brown we can stick a.
Toothpick anna and nothing comes out and.
Then we're gonna have to let it cool for.
Many more minutes so i'll see you looks.
Like a porn tower.
Oh time for the pink drink all right.
Sisters it is pink kitty drink any time.
And we have all of our ingredients right.
Here.
The pumpkin bright is about to be done.
So it's the perfect time to start making.
Our drink so we can sister sip while we.
Get ready for our breakfast that has.
Taken us two hours so far using a large.
Measuring cup filled with 16 ounces of.
Cold water well that's all like that's.
Nothing so now that i started this.
Recipe is to identify at pocket of the.
Starbucks insert refreshers now don't.
Get me wrong.
I love starbucks but i'm slightly.
Annoyed that i have to use this because.
It definitely makes it feel less.
Homemade but at the same time we were.
Going for that authentic pink candy.
Drink edite so you gotta do what you.
Gotta do i picked it would be a very.
Very hibiscus refresher it's gonna pour.
This in to our nice little cup here.
Right now in order to prepare i went.
Ahead and i boiled 1 cup water on top of.
My stove so we can make some tea oh it's.
Hot oh now we're gonna get one pocket of.
The itas oh a passionate tea now if you.
Have been a long time with starbucks the.
Sister before we had the pink drink all.
Of us typical white girls used to get.
Our passion tea lemonade and this is.
What they used to make this stuff it's.
Honestly really good for us were just.
Going to put that in there.
No we have to wait there's way too much.
Waiting in these recipes might as well.
Just go to starbucks and get it i put a.
Bunch of starbucks at least 10 times and.
Back by now and the time is taking us to.
Fill this video no yeah it cost forty.
Seven dollars for the ingredients of.
This yeah you are kidding no oh my god.
Forty seven dollars no and this is not.
Worth it in any way shape andor form.
For the time nor the money this just.
Turned into a starbucks prandial i mean.
It already was even go get two three.
Drinks the pump everybody what the heck.
Now we've let our tea steep in the pot.
And get nice and juicy for about five.
Minutes now so i'm just going to take.
This and i'm going to squeeze the.
Remaining juices out this has been a way.
Too long of a process but i will say it.
Smells amazing and this kitchen right.
Now.
My god so now we're going to take our.
Passion tea and mix it together with our.
Very very hibiscus refresher looking.
Beautiful is this it like even now now.
We're just gonna take our reusable.
Starbucks a tumbler with our reusable.
Straw and fill it with some nice chunks.
Of ice but like a little bit of ice oh.
Tippy forming a cold drink from.
Starbucks you said a 100% always order.
Light ice ordering light ice is just say.
Far better drink - iced ratio assoc for.
The price sisters not a budget now we're.
Gonna take our mixture and pour the cup.
Until it is halfway full.
And obviously every brace that makes.
Pink drinks differently but i personally.
Prefer when there's a little bit more.
Pink and then there is drink a 4060.
Ratio of the pink drink and the coconut.
Milk but obviously personal preference.
We're just gonna top the rest off with.
Some unsweetened coconut milk we're just.
Gonna fill the rest up beautiful oh our.
Pumpkin breads done a perfect timing.
Okay wait wait i don't know oh shoot oh.
Oh wow look at how beautiful that is.
That is good and fresh unless you are.
Cute a toast let's do our toothpick test.
Clean it's done okay now we have to put.
This in at the fridge for 30 minutes to.
Cool down we don't have 30 minutes so.
We're going to put this in the freezer.
And hope that it gets chilly quickly.
Because we have to go this has taken.
Three hours already.
For literally no reason i could have.
Gotten it in two minutes as our luck's.
Right now put it on your plastic shelves.
In the freezer the pan this is taking.
Three hours you get a godless desirable.
Trick to manage this is not worth that.
Since i have now been informed that.
Putting this in my freezer would burn a.
Hole through the plastic i am actually.
Going to leave this on my stove top and.
Holes down into the next 10 minutes.
Because i'm over this video and i have.
Things to do let's finish this drink.
This looks awful.
Like what this toxin not good the race.
Here was a little wrong let's milk in it.
Oh that is not right oh kick to chest.
Again.
Okay like there okay that's good we're.
Gonna try this with regular coconut milk.
Instead of unsweetened coconut i don't.
Know who what made that i figured.
Decision it was not me i'll tell you.
That right now.
But maybe this will taste a little bit.
Oh it's closed better let's see this now.
Oh that's so gross just color i've ever.
Seen this is not right it's purple.
That's really dark purple last step i'm.
Going to grab these freeze-dried.
Strawberries it's like strawberry chips.
Can i eat this this would be the good.
Nor fries.
Our last tap stick this straw in there.
Oops.
Okay what i guess this completes our.
Venti pink candy drinking purply purply.
This video is cancelled how do i get.
This out of here oh my god girls don't.
Rob me good now we're gonna cut a nice.
Thick slice that is professional look at.
That oh my god you guys oh it's still.
Sister's steaming for a real one alright.
Sisters oh my god three hours later we.
Are finally done with our breakfast.
Option for today i had truly thought.
This is going to be an easy video to.
Film and of course i was wrong.
I didn't however have a very good time.
Doing this and the pumpkin bread it.
Looks great the pink drink not so much.
I think the only way to see how we.
Actually did is with the taste test so.
I'm ready to dive right in and first one.
Oh god but just my fort and like a nice.
Little slice of my pumpkin right here.
Oh we're gonna look same-sex oh my god.
I'm a professional baker look at this.
Same beautiful golden a brown color.
Nice dark brown crust on the outside.
With a good pumpkin seed crunchy texture.
This is pretty good fresh you would.
Never even know if i put this in front.
Of you let's see how to actually compare.
As taste wise oh my god that's laughs oh.
My god.
Oh my god you were good that was such a.
Delicious and hearty piece of bread but.
All of this chewing has left my throat.
So dry i think i should maybe wash it.
All down with a sip of my diy do it.
Yourself.
That's what gi right means done.
Thinkety thinkety that turned out purple.
Oh it doesn't taste like strawberries at.
All it tastes like fashion tea lemonade.
But like with milk instead of lemonade.
Which is not good i will tell you right.
Now i think it's because we use the very.
Very hibiscus refresher instead of the.
Like strawberry one but there was no.
Strawberry hace refresher to actually.
Use if they do this on purpose so we.
Cannot actually do this at home that's.
So disappointing all that work and we.
Get this are you guys i guess this.
Concludes me trying to make my daily.
Starbucks order at home from scratch let.
Me know what you guys think this pumpkin.
Bread recipe lochia slaps like ten out.
Of ten would recommend you guys should.
Definitely try this at home it's like a.
Really really good and fresh breakfast.
Item this pink candy drinkin tea however.
Is not a pink tea drinker tea as a.
Disgrace.
Pinkie drinkin tea sweetie i am so sorry.
I was already suspicious going into this.
But all the recipes recommended the.
Passion tea and the very very hibiscus.
Refresher is because i'm an avid at.
Starbucks fanatic and neither one of.
Those two drinks are even close to the.
Taste of the pink drink and i was.
Definitely right because this tastes.
Absolutely awful although this is very.
Very far that secretes these things at.
Home today it took me at 3 hours i would.
Much rather run to starbucks and take.
Five minutes and spend only five dollars.
And have a far better and faster morning.
