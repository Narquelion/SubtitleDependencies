Sweaty dream i came to california i went.
To a guy's house and twitter and i.
Didn't have like any crush on him at all.
So i was really really nervous to be.
There and really slept in the same bag.
However i was like uncomfortable so i.
Wanted to sleep in like full club pants.
And a sweatshirt and like how like eight.
Blankets out of a woke up with like.

So that i was like mine was normal i.
Only met james like a year and a half.
Ago yeah yeah like right like a couple.
Months before christmas of last year.
Because the nice thing was is that he.
Live in downtown only a couple blocks.
From me as to where everyone else here.
Kind of lives further away so me and.
James would hang out a lot because.
Like within like a five-minute walk from.
Each other we started hanging out like.
Literally everything every single day i.
Guess we both made youtube videos and.
Then i would help james then he would.
Help me and you only had like i don't.
Know how many subscribers at the time.
You had just like hit over a million i.
Say yeah and i'm the same one in scream.
Cuz you're answering youtube are kind of.
Always the same yeah so it's just like.
Also that but i feel like my first.
Impression was just normal.
Yeah just a normal meeting of a person.
Like it wasn't anything weird that's.
What everyone thinks i mean laura have.
Sex all the time and realize that we.
Love a tional ii jump in we're talking.
Weird he likes to pick his bellybutton.
And smelly oh no it's fine do you ever.

To wear jumpsuits alternative out of me.
And say that i always like jumping out.
Of my clothes i wasn't jumping out of a.
Plane.
Laughter.
And it looked really good on me so i was.
Like yeah i was ahead of the time sorry.
I can't help myself.
I'm just too fashionable whenever i'm.
Getting rid of clothes cassio emerged i.
Love a good throw by our source full per.
Se yeah vintage i know why i know i know.
I know he can he just likes the.
Challenge so he goes for the ones that.
Don't want him secretly but they can't.
Come out yeah i know what it is also.
James is a very much of a person that's.
Like i need it now.
Right now suck it so it's not even like.
Oh let's date for like a couple of weeks.
And you can come over to my house after.
Like a month like a normal relationship.
It's like you're cool i'm probably gonna.
Do something and then yeah yeah yeah.
Maybe miyamura we could talk again i.
Think you just want someone so quickly.
That maybe maybe they get turned off by.
It and they're also straight yeah well.
Yeah i mean i'm supposed to answer them.
You're gonna have to so he must be.
Talking about the other stuff i like.
What i like i like everyone in here for.
Different reasons well i don't know i.
Have no knees who's the longest mean.
Cause you have like are we shared like.
Such a passion for makeup that we always.
Like get to work on that together me.
More are just dumb i've had so many.
Crazy memories.
The intruder together almost every.
Single day so teresa pick one you can't.
Music.
Oh i'm scared tweet them pretending to.
Be friends he doesn't like someone he.
Will not be back and i'm let them know.
He doesn't like them too oh yeah i want.
To give him free cloud i think i'm like.
In a pretty good place than most people.
In the community i know but i definitely.
Like a little awkwardly way to like you.
Know what i mean like i won't talk to.
Anybody if i don't like that you're also.
The most famous of all so yeah like you.
Don't even there's not even anyone but.
To me that does not matter our follower.
Count doesn't it does today no i always.
Ask him to check us out so fun to see so.
Like i'm always like james what's your.
Artistic i don't know i've been checked.
In a couple days that's olivia i do it's.
Not a numbers game for me like i don't.
Really care yeah but it is fun you.
Trying to know your red charlie mine.
Didn't even exceed the hundred dollar.
Threshold you should cry laura so like i.
Was obviously already friends lacaze and.
Hey-zeus and we like we face name all.
The time but when i started really.
Coming to california often for different.
Shoots or different like bookings i.
Started talking with laura and her.
Family because they were nice enough to.
Let me literally live with them and take.
Laura's brother's room for six months on.
And off and we just got like really.
Really close i obviously moved from new.
York so i don't really have family here.
So laura stylet became.
Like my family and they were it was just.
So kind and so welcoming and they were.
Always there for me and then obviously i.
Met drew to work together almost every.
Single day and same thing with alden and.
Victor victor nails are obviously cold.
Or straight man and like it's just cool.
To like have their support and love to.
Is just like when it comes to security.
And protection it always just like being.
There to defend us and stuff especially.
Like being in the industry for three.
Years now like i've got so many amazing.
People but i've also met so many.
Horrible people and i've been involved.
Like with so much and like they have.
Just always been by my side through.
Everything no matter what and they get.
And they're with me and like they just.
Know my true intention so like just know.
You come for james you come it's just.
Really cool to have like such an amazing.
Group of people around me at all times.
That i can really really rely on like if.
I had not had these guys like i probably.
Would not be here today like i would not.
Be as emotionally strong i would.
Definitely like you be a stripper we do.
Take it personal so whenever we see hate.
Comments we really do they learn to talk.
About the hate james may not see it but.
We reply what can we save like no no.
Just be a bigger person yeah so he.
Inspires us to be better people at the.
End of the day i think it's you like.
Social media can look so crazy from the.
Outside like when you're not really.
Involved in it it's kind of hard to like.
Really understand like what's going on.
And it's easy to make assumptions or.
Like generalize things or like say.
People are copy or like scandals and.
Stuff i know influence just always say.
Like oh you don't you don't really know.
What it's like until you're in it but.
Like the reality is like you really.
Don't you have no idea what it's like.
And what goes on behind the scenes and.
The emotional pressure that goes on and.
Like for me it's it's hard because like.
I can't really talk about it with a lot.
Of people because it could come across.
As really egotistical as ungrateful when.
In reality it's like it can be really.
Hard sometimes so like it's been great.
To how these guys around me because they.
Do get it not only how they see me grow.
And experience it but they're also like.
They witness it to look at it's not as.
Crazy when you're seeing it happen.
Firsthand i guess you've seen some crazy.
Stuff happened.
Three things he was coke coke honest i.
See a broken phone is twitter coca-cola.
If you actually had a gas what would be.
Things like seriously like if okay.
Seriously i'm not like i'm really really.
Getting dropped off the helicopter.
Plummeting down to the staff james would.
Bring with him his phone a solar paneled.
Phone charger and no because you can't.
Get by on a coke a chili's gift card my.
Straw for his coconut oh yeah my.
Favorite is a red hoodie because it just.
