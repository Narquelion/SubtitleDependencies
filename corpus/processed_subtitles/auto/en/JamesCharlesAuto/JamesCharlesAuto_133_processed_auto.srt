Favorite makeup tricks that i have ever.
Learned today and truly likes bridge oh.
Get the mac fix+.
Drop and pick up the fan we're gonna.
Spray myself with this morphe m45 brush.
And i too many steps i came and found.
The brush the m-52 7 brush but i guess.
That works.
Contour my cheekbones or something like.
That or bronze my cheekbones i think.
It's called i'm using the morphe m 405.
Brush use ko james for 10% off we're.
Also gonna be using the anastasia.
Beverly hills contour kit the light to.
Medium i'm gonna grab the palette i'm.
Gonna dip it into this i will do two.
Lines on top of my nose.
If you're someone like me you're trying.
To kind of fool beyond your nose looks a.
Lot smaller you definitely do not want.
To follow your non sono save in the.
Situation and the contours where you.
Wish your nose all right we're gonna.
Move on so i just really like to kind of.
Reinforce that later on while the face.
Is still really really fresh and kind of.
Do it because it does everything we knew.
The nose hollow because if you put the.
Completely from the effect of the pitch.
Smells but if you put it just on these.
Honeys tip of the nose range or right in.
Between those two contour lines it's.
Really gonna further afield lose it and.
Make it look like her that was spread.
Just literally like wow moving on.
Better saw her face we went to a lightly.
Baked earth base but make on face man.
Once again using my camp you under and.
Dipping into them right on the sides of.
My nose to enforce the highlights which.
Once again further the illusion of a.
Pinched and snatched nose and when i.
Wipe this mall in a little while it's.
Gonna kind of brighten up that entire.
Area and just clean up the contour what.
Just makes it look a little bit more.
Defined it a little bit more copped it.
Fetched i got a white beer to grow and.
Meet only being sixty and i could really.
Grow a full beard so kind.
What the saying goes browser not twins.
They're sisters wait a second why is.
This brown pencil pink i'm gonna hold my.
Pencil vertically into my face and i'm.
Gonna use a very very light pressure and.
Just lightly place my pencil i just kind.
Of flick it upwards to create.
Natural-looking hair strokes all right i.
Think this eyebrow looks okay i'm gonna.
Be a lazy piece like james and do the.
Old one off camera i'll be right back.
All right i gotta find a brush i really.
Am i guess i'm concealer some shape tape.
Concealer get a little bit on with that.
Brush and then i'm just gonna go right.
In and start cleaning up that brow very.
Very carefully all right i think i did.
My concealer pretty well moving on.
Mushroom    close one eye and open.
The other so i'm not sure i'm gonna do.
This part.

Gonna start by bringing this one in.
Starting right at the root of the lash.
Almost in my upper waterline and just oh.
