Super happy healthy but most importantly.
Safe holiday season.
Personally i spent my night doing.
Absolutely nothing which was incredible.
Wouldn't change anything ten out of ten.
Would recommend i played mario kart did.
A few different makeup look hung out.
With a bunch of old friends and also met.
A ton of new friends and honestly you.

Because i'm just only not in my life.
Right now but twenty twenty so far has.
Been treating me very very well and i.
Really hope it's been the same for you.
Guys i truly feel like this is going to.
Be our year i'm just like i'm feeling.
The energy and the vibes like all.
Together but i am very very stated to.
All the projects all the fun things that.
We have coming for 2020 i thought it'd.
Be really really fun to just sit down.
Together do a little bit of a chit chat.
Get ready to me there's been a lot of.
Things happening in my life resent that.
I want to catch you guys up on and also.
I've pretty much like completely changed.
My everyday on makeup routine i.
Literally have so many new things so.
What are you techniques on new products.
This is a very wearable everyday to have.
Makeup look but elevate it to the next.
Level and i think you guys are not so.
Gonna love this so if you guys want to.
Get ready to lean and see my updated.
Makeup routine talk a little bit about.
2019 but more importantly talk about.
2020 and all the fun things coming soon.
Keep on watching.
Music.
Before we jump right in did anybody.
Notice the new graphics on the channel.
Control i am literally obsessive how.
They turned out i thought it'd be really.
Fun to go into 2020 with a few new.
Things on it - the videos they get to my.
Good friend of michael who designed it.
He does all the youtuber intros and he's.
Literally so talented make sure you guys.
Check them out and also leave me a.
Comment down below if you notice.
Anything else okay time to jump in so.
One of my favorite things that i did.
Over the holiday break was getting a.
Tattoo a face tattoo okay no i did not.
Get anything crazy i know i uploaded one.
At robbing my makeup routine but i'm not.
A soundcloud rapper just yeah i want.
Obviously keep you guys posted my.
Sisters but i did get my eyebrows a.
Microplane and spoiler alert i am.
Obsessed with the result i'm gonna tell.
You guys about it while i go ahead and.
Conceal my brows which is now the first.
Type of a makeup routine i know there's.
Video footage of me out there saying.
That i would never do my eyebrows first.
I just really like to have my full base.
On and then put the eyebrows overtop.
Because i feel like it's so hard to just.
Carve them out and just get everything.
But after trying this technique out and.
My celebrity makeup hacks video and.
Getting them done i will honestly say.
This is like the best decision that i've.
Ever made a my makeup routine that now.
Takes me at like literally 30 minutes.
Lasts and i am obsessed with how they.
Turned out i came across this micro.
Bleeding artist by the name of brown jam.
And i was so shocked by her work because.
It was much different than like the.
Typical kind of like chainin and a.
Blocky and micro bleeding that a lot of.
People kind of had when it first became.
Like a thing and it was very focused i'm.
Just like tiny little thin hair strokes.
I was so good and i was so shocked by it.
That i literally commented on her post.
And was like this is the best microbe.
Winning that i've ever seen i didn't.
Think anything of it and i just went to.
Bed but the next morning i woke up and.
Check my instagram deion's and she.
Actually me and her name was jeanne but.
She was living in scotland and i was.
Talking to her about micro bleeding and.
She's like oh my god i would love to do.
Your brows one day and i was like yeah.
I'll let you know if i'm ever overseas.
And she's like oh i will literally come.
To la and do them for you if you want i.
Was like oh my god no way like i'd kind.
Of be down low key and she's literally.
Like okay let me know i'll book a flight.
Like now and i was like okay kind of.
Down and then she was here so long story.
Short janine.
Flew all the way here from a scotland -.
Micro blade my eyebrows and i am.
Obsessed with the results she did.
Literally the best job guru sai brows.
Look amazing as well.
She's oops i'm gonna leave janine's.
Links down below.
None of the eyebrows are all outlined.
And blended out i know it looks a little.
Bit crazy right now.
This.
Like look right i was literally the.
Reasoning for me not wanting to do this.
Step beforehand but i now realized that.
It is way easier to clean up later on so.
If you're watching this and you two are.
An eye brows before foundation hater.
Like i was just bear with me because.
It'll come together later on and who.
Knows maybe you'll change your routine.
As well because i'm loving this anyway.
Okay while that concealer is drying down.
A little bit i'm just gonna grab a.
Little bit of the dragon beauty color.
Corrector just like always and put this.
On my beard area this step has not.
Changed i still want to cover up my.
Beard and five o'clock shadow such as i.
Possibly can so now while this is right.
Now i'm gonna go ahead and do my skin.
Private before foundation someone's.
Gonna got my touch-up water cream and a.
Little fluffy brush i'm just going to.
Brush this on my skin and i'm actually.
Going to avoid my nose area because my.
Nose gets really really oily and i've.
Noticed that not moisturizing it.
Honestly helps the foundation stay a.
Little bit better and then with the.
Touch s self canvas primer i'm just.
Gonna grab a flat foundation brush this.
07 hues good things.
For 10% off i'm just going to grab a.
Little bit of this and applied this area.
To my central cheek area kind of which.
Is where i have like a bigger pores to.
Fill this in and smooth this out and.
Then finally i know this is very.
Dramatic but like i said has been.
Working well for me recently i'm gonna.
Grab the event a beauty troop matte.
Primer and put a little bit of this onto.
My finger and i'm just going to apply.
This primer to my nose to keep it true.
Matte like it says in the name and.
That's it.
Alright now that all that prep work is.
Done and out of the way we are finally.
Ready to learn to foundation and for.
Today i'm gonna using a brand new one.
And that is the dior eric lash.
Foundation now i honestly have no clue.
Why i didn't pick this up until recently.
But i'm very fresh to do myself that i.
Did it because the formula is so bomb.
And also what the undertones are like.
Perfect the shade is 1n and literally.
Okay like you're looking so good this is.
For my face ready for this no i ain't.
Ready for this okay ready literally by.
Skin tone that's literally my skin tone.
Oh my god we have essentially found the.
Color that is for me like this is 2020.
Is gonna be my year i'm matching.
Foundation i'm actually just gonna spray.
This on the back of my assisters easier.
So i can dip into it like a palette.
Because the fumes are slightly toxic.
What not talks like to please don't sue.
Me.
Good to breathe it all so i'm just.
Putting this into my skin using the juno.
And kala.
Microfiber sponge and it's like this.
Like weird fuzzy type of a sponge but it.
Does such a good job of blending the.
Foundation into at my skin all right now.
That we have the base all on moving on.
To concealer nothing has changed.
So i'm gonna grab my tart shape tape and.
This one is in the shade light okay so.
While glad it's all together i thought.
It'd be kind of fun to do a quick 2019.
Recap and when i say quick i do mean.
Quick okay choose a 19 was a mess but.
There were some amazing things that we.
Did in this past year so let's talk.
About them so starting off the year in.
January my first days of 2019 were.
Actually spent in a tennessee way that.
The cimorelli girls we got to spend new.
Year's together and then we recorded the.
Never enough cover that is now the.
Second most viewed video on my channel.
Of all time which is so wild to think.
About i love those girls so so so much.
And i got to see them a few times to.
2019 which is actually amazing and then.
Later on in the month of january i went.
To the uk for the first time ever which.
Was so much fun i'm going to the uk was.
On my bucket list for literally so long.
And we were finally able to make it.
Happen i got a chance to open up the.
Morphe store in the bullring mall and.
I'm birmingham and it was one of the.
Best days of my entire life.
Over 10,000 sister showed up for the.
Meeting greet it was insane and then we.
Had february which i feel like was a.
Really really good month of youtube.
Content we had a lot of really good.
Clubs and interview with jenna marbles.
The flog squad one also the house tour.
With mr. king which was one of my.
Favorite products that i've ever worked.
On we also had the valentine's day a.
Single look which of course segue to.
2020 single unfortunately for me but who.
Knows and then i also attended the bratz.
Challenge in 2019 which was my favorite.
Youtube challenges probably ever the.
Makeup books that came out of that were.
Crazy while we talk about march i'm just.
Going to skip my face using the laura.
Mercier translucent setting powder.
Marked was actually another really.
Amazing month when it came to a content.
On the channel.
I got to put my linguistic skills to the.
Test for the makeup tutorial in espanol.
Which was so much fun and we actually.
Found out a few weeks ago in the youtube.
Rewind that that video was the number.
One most liked beauty video of 2019.
Which is ridiculous to think about.
Considering the amount of beauty content.
That was released this year by -.
Nonetheless i am so grateful for and i'm.
Still though that you guys loved it to.
Contour gonna grab my anasazi contour.
Palette and maya morphe m 405 brush to.
Chisel out my face while i talk about.
The.
Month which is april we started off the.
Month by doing something actually i'm.
Really fond up with the fenomena buick.
Fashion show that is paired with one of.
The designers from the fidelma program.
Anyway we have custom up and i got to.
Walk down the runway which was such a.
Cool experience one i got to learn a lot.
More about being a runway model which i.
Read had a lot of respect for models to.
Begin with but after actually doing it.
It's very very challenging i will say -.
I got to be a model for an amazing.
Designer danny 3 a lot of my friends.
Were involved which made it even more.
Fun drew laura and nikita also walked.
The runway in a beautiful outfit and for.
Your girl needed some redemption because.
My laughs oh my walk that walk oh my.
Goodness it was diabolical.
Also april is always my favorite event.
Of the entire year which is coachella.
Now i'm not gonna go into too much.
Detail about this for very obvious.
Bittersweet reasons but on a positive.
Note i've had to see ariana grande and.
Black pink and billy eilish all her fur.
Alive and they are three of my favorite.
Artists of all times that was so much.
Fun i got to hang out all my best.
Friends and my outputs were sickening oh.
My god they caused quite a ruckus and.
Stir on social media i will say it but.
Honestly i was kind of the point of them.
My bunch looked phenomenal i just had.
Like the best time running around the.
Festival my literal butt cheeks hanging.
Out it's crazy that is to say i just.
Felt so confident and so free and i.
Think that's honestly the point of.
Coachella as a whole so i'm very excited.
To see what this year's outfits have to.
Offer now the next month of the year is.
May and obviously we know the two things.
That happen at that month first being at.
The met gala i got to work with.
Alexander wang who's with me.
They were designers of all time for my.
Safety pen top and i just felt so cool.
Being there but also just like so.
Nervous and overwhelmed as well because.
That was one of the first times that.
They ever had youtubers at an event like.
That which was obviously a major.
Breakthrough and like the social media.
Space i was there without lilly singh.
And liza koshi who i have so much.
Respect for it's not even funny the.
Onset of the met gala in may of course.
We all know i also had my birthday.
Taking a super quick pause from the.
Recap i just wanna quickly show you guys.
Saying that i've been doing a lot.
Recently during my nose at contour stop.
Just cover a little bit of concealer on.
The back of my hand and a fluffy a dense.
Brush i'm just going to pop this.
Concealer into my eyelid and then just.
Really quickly set that into a place my.
Contouring process on my face in my nose.
Is pretty much the exact same which is.
Why i skipped through it because you.
Guys said to me do it literally a.
Million times but there is one thing.
That i do a little bit differently so.
I'm gonna take my fluffy blending.
I'd give it to my same kind of like.
Bronzy contouring shade and then i like.
To take this fluffy brush and at the top.
Of my nose contour okay i'm not talking.
About like the skinny horse because we.
Still wanted to be very very sad but in.
This lake.
Kind of round area in between the nose.
And your eyebrow who was going to run.
This color right up into here blending.
It into the front of the eyebrow but i'm.
Also going to take the excess of that.
Color and blend it through the crease.
And then pull it up towards my temple as.
You can see between this eyelid and this.
Eyelid there is a noticeable difference.
This one has a little bit more shadow in.
Here and with this kind of like lion.
Flagging up and out like that i just.
Kind of like pulls the eye upwards for.
Is this eye is just completely flat so i.
Think it just adds a really nice.
Definition into the eyelid it pulls.
Everything up nicely and it gives the.
Nose contour sling to kind of blend into.
Instead of just doing like two brown.
Lines on the side of your nose.
Definitely recommend trying this out if.
You guys have never before before i move.
On to the brows in the eyes i do want to.
Add a little bit of dimension into the.
Face so i'm just gonna grab this pinky.
Tone up blush from mac eye for the.
Longest time hated pinky tone blushes.
But i've really been liking it more.
Pinky tone blushes recently i believe.
They look very very useful and cute.
Stepping back into my anasazi contour.
Palette with my this brush i'm just.
Gonna dip into the lighter shade and use.
This to highlight underneath my eyes so.
The next month was jude which was.
Honestly a pretty quiet month for me but.
I wouldn't have wanted it any other way.
It was a much-needed time of healing.
Positivity and just relaxation and being.
Around the people that i love the most.
And doing the things that i love the.
Most so i didn't do a whole lot but it.
Did end up with a really really positive.
No which i'm gonna talk about while i do.
My eyebrows starting off i got to sing.
At the national anthem with to my best.
Friends zoe and anthony at a charity.
Basketball game at the staples center.
Which was i don't even know the words.
That i have to explain how incredible.
That opportunity was.
Applause.
And it was just exactly what i needed.
And during that time so that was saying.
That i'm really really grateful for and.
Then literally a from that game we drove.
Directly to the airport and then flew to.
In new york on a red-eye because the.
Next day i was walking in the pride.
Parade with the trevor project it's.
Really crazy to think about because i've.
Been out as a gay man since i was 12.
Years old which is almost half of my.
Life and i grew up in new york and then.
Moved to la three years ago which are.
Two of the most accepting places like.
Literally in the entire world but for.
Some reason i was never able to attend.
Any pride events there was always.
Something on my calendar going on where.
I couldn't go so this is my first pride.
Ever but it was so much fun oh my god it.
Just really made me so grateful and.
Proud to be part of my community and i.
Am very much looking forward to making.
Sure my calendar is cleared for future.
Pride events all right you guys i just.
Do in doing so i can focus on the eyes.
Super quickly like i said we are not.
Doing any eyeshadow with this look but i.
Do want to pop on it just a slight.
Little wing just to kind of a further.
Pull up the faith and essentially.
Everything is so what i'm gonna do first.
Is grab my morphe mfi hold a brush and.
Just dip back into my contour palette.
From before and tip into the darkest.
Brown shade in the corner and just gonna.
Create a little wing at the outer corner.
Of my eye using this color it's looking.
That looks really bad because we're.
Gonna blow into that in a second anyway.
But i'm basically just topping this.
Shade and the shapeable wing now with.
That same broad brush from before and.
That same brow powder actually i'm just.
Going to dip back into that dark brown.
Shade and i'm gonna use this color and.
Be it much more careful and go right up.
Against the lash line and create a.
Little bit more of a defined way i.
Really like using the brow powder for.
This because it has pigment to it but.
It's not like a super super opaque.
Eyeshadow so you actually have time to.
Layer up a little bit another trick that.
I've been doing a lot recently is taking.
That same a brow powder and that angled.
Brush and creating a very tiny line at.
The inner corner point of my eye.
Pulling the upwards following the shape.
Of lian natural lid and as you can see.
This just elongate my eyes a little bit.
And really furthers that like i thought.
And the loss of that is just gonna be.
Grabbing a little bit more of my amound.
Ation on a little brush and i'm just.
Going to clean up the bottom of that.
Wing for a super sharp.
July for me was actually a pretty good.
Month not a whole lot happened to be.
Quite honest it was the middle of summer.
And we were honestly just going to have.
A good time but it was gonna like to.
Start to me getting back into like my.
Normal day-to-day routine again which.
Was pretty awesome this summer because.
Of pewdiepie making a bunch of minecraft.
Videos the minecraft community on.
Youtube really like skyrocketed once.
Again and kind of revived the game which.
Was a really amazing for me because.
Despite the fact that i love makeup i.
Actually speak you jay more as a kid.
Which a lot of you guys know about.
Minecraft was a huge huge hobby of mine.
And growing up especially the hunger.
Games so when the minecraft monday's.
Tournament was announced i was all-in.
And so excited to get to play it was a.
Really cool thing for me to be part of.
It i'm honestly so grateful for the.
Experience and i was so pleasantly.
Surprised by how nice and how kind and.
How welcoming and how funny everyone in.
The gaming world was when it came to me.
Playing in the tournament i just had the.
Best time i looked forward to it every.
Single week i'm so sad that it ended i.
Genuinely missed the community that we.
Built up but if it ever comes back y'all.
Know that i'll be ready to slay and who.
Knows maybe in 2020 i'll sort of gaming.
Channel probably not but let me know if.
You guys want to see more of that.
Content now next comes august and during.
This month i mean probably one of the.
Biggest mistakes of my entire year which.
Was please shank my head it obviously.
Made for a very very ending youtube.
Video one of the funniest i think we've.
Ever posted i loved the way that i.
Looked with platinum hair the after.
Effects are berber not so great because.
After a few months it started to get.
Really damaged and i tried to bleed to.
Intone it i think one too many times and.
Then eventually one morning i took a.
Shower and went to wash my hair and.
Realized that my hair that was falling.
Out of my head so that was a really.
Really unfortunate discovery that i have.
Now been dealing with the repercussions.
Of ever since but it's been about three.
Months now of hair regrowth and.
Obviously i'm dr. brown i'm feeling way.
Better and much more confident now but.
Unless i'm wearing a wig i will probably.
Have brown hair for majority of 2020.
Letting you guys know right now also for.
Lashes today i just popped on a pair of.
Lily lashes and the style miami flares.
You can use coach james for 15% off of.
Those lashes lily or if anybody from.
Your team is watching this please help.
Me a full box of these desperately need.
Them like a look at how pretty that is.
Hello.
Alright you guys those are both eyes all.
Complete and we were almost another.
Makeup routine i'm just gonna go ahead.
My mom any excess powder that we have.
Left on the face while we finish up the.
Rest of the year september was quite a.
Jam-packed moment it started off with.
Learning how to dance with abby lee.
Miller or at least trying 200mw lee.
Miller i also got the opportunity to go.
Back to new york for a fashion week in.
September which was so much fun i am.
Very much looking forward to doing more.
Fashion related things and trying to up.
My style in 2020 at the end of september.
I finally got to meet my new best friend.
For a light and that is when we adopted.
Our golden retriever puppy which we.
Named finnegan.
I haven't thinking about adopting a.
Puppy since i moved into this new house.
Which is over a year ago now but it's a.
Temper at the time i finally felt right.
We weren't traveling we were home and i.
Was finally kind of getting everything.
Back together during the month of.
September i was obviously still posting.
Youtube videos and instagram photos and.
Stuff and try my best to put on a smile.
For the camera because i would be.
Completely lying if i said that i was.
Happy during that month because i was.
Not at all and i was still really trying.
Hard to just get everything back.
Together working with mental health and.
Obviously finnegan doesn't know this but.
He helped me is so much during that time.
Period just having somebody an animal to.
Hog in to cuddle with at night and just.
Working on training him and welcoming.
Into the home it made me so much happier.
And really helped my mood and just.
Seeing how he's crawling so much over.
The past days i forgot his huge now has.
Just been a major major light in my life.
When i really needed most so yeah he's.
Like i said my new best friend and i'm.
So was so glad that we finally finally.
Made the move and adopted him because.
It's been like the best decision that.
I've ever ever made whoo next up as we.
All know comes october which is that.
Spooky season of my favorite time of the.
Entire year that we started out this.
Month with quite a bang with the james.
House ex murphy at mini how much which i.
Just used my hair in a blush like i said.
In there until they do this was not.
Supposed to be anything crazy or.
Groundbreaking for 2019 in the makeup.
Community this is truly for the hardcore.
Fans the lovers of the original palette.
They wanted something more small and.
Travel friendly and i think we.
Definitely delivered that along with an.
Incredible campaign that i got to work.
With the wigs and makeup my other job.
November was honestly a really really.
Fun month as well i got to go to las.
Vegas nevada for an ulta ex murphy meet.
And greet which was so much fun i will.
Forever remember that me in greek.
Because of how nice every single person.
That i met was the time flew by so fast.
As i was generally just styling and the.
Entire time i also went back home to.
Upstate new york for at thanksgiving.
Which was an experience and a half to.
Say at the least we also launched the.
Sisters apparel holiday collection which.
Really amazing and i'm so grateful for.
Your guys to support odd and then.
Finally we ended off the month with an.
Announcement that i've been waiting.
Three years to make and that was that i.
Got the opportunity to produce my very.
Own reality competition show on one set.
Of youtube for the beauty community now.
We've been working on it since that.
Announcement non-stop and the filming.
Actually starts in a few weeks from now.
Which is huh so what i would think about.
There are still so many things to get.
Done so i've been scrambling behind the.
Scenes to work on everything but it's.
Been such a fun and incredible process.
And i know that you guys are going to.
Absolutely love it and it's gonna be.
Something so positive for 2020 which is.
The exact vibes that we're going for.
We're putting out into the universe it's.
Gonna be amazing so i hope that you guys.
Are excited just as much as i am and.
Finally december was a month for you.

Influencer which is hostess sisters at.

Speaking of the palette from earlier i.
Just want to say a quick thank you to.
