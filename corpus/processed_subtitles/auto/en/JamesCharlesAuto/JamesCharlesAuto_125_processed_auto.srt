Alright sir i already went ahead and.
Primed my face using my benefit total.
Moisture moisturizer and then my benefit.
Porefessional primer as always i'm gonna.
Put on a headband here because my hair.
Is looking a real real wonky today and.
It's not styling for the life of me so i.
Kind of just gave up i'm gonna throw in.
A hat as soon as possible just bear with.
Me while i do my base here and i.
I will fix this situation in a few.
Minutes for my foundation today as.
Always i'm gonna be using my makeup.
Forever ultra hd foundation stick in the.
Shade of y 335 and i'm just gonna put.
This all over my face but i'm actually.
Not going to use too much of it today.
And then of course i'm just gonna take.
My damp beauty blender and blend this in.
For concealer today we're going to be.
Using of course maya tart shaped tape.
Concealer of the holy grail and today.
I'm using the shade light i have usually.
Been using the shade light medium honey.
Recently but in the photo kim definitely.
Has some very very very high contrast.
Between the rest of her face and her.
Like t-zone region being her under eyes.
In the very center of her forehead so i.
Do want to recruit that as much as.
Possible and add that our vic terno.
2010 at kim k sia of glam i'm so.
Freaking excited to see the fact that.
She's definitely going back to her like.
Roots with the full on full coverage.
Glam.
I missed that kim so much it was by far.
My favorite era of hers i do obviously.
Love the natural face she's in as well.
As i've said a million times in the past.
Few videos but you always got to go back.
To your roots at some point.
All right so i just went ahead and.
Quickly set my face and locked it in.
Place using my too faced born this way.
Ethereal setting powder i have a very.
Very exciting and fun video coming out.
In a few weeks from now about setting.
Powders and the battle between them and.
Flashback and everything and you can.
Possibly think of because lord knows i.
Am the queen of setting powders and.
Flashback photos so definitely stay.
Tuned for that coming soon so in the.
Photo that mario posted kim was.
Definitely super super bronzed and.
Contoured so of course i want to.
Recreate that as much as possible.
Because y'all know i love a good runs in.
Contoured look so of course i'm gonna.
Start off like i'm in my benefit hoola.
Bronzer and my morphe m 570 brush and.
You can use code at james for 10% off.
Your purchase at morphe brushes com i'm.
Just gonna start chiseling out my.
Cheekbones and really warming up the.
Outside edges of my face i am definitely.
Rubbing a decent amount of this product.
When i actually go and i am going pretty.
Light handed with this brush because i.
Do want a lot of product on there but i.
Want to build it up slowly over time.
Because if we put a lot on there at one.
Time is just gonna get super super muddy.
And obviously we want it to be super.
Super blended out and nice and beautiful.
And bronzy so i am just being a pretty.
Careful to go nice and slow and just.
Disperse the color evenly all throughout.
My face i'm also going to use this color.
To bronze up my forehead as always.
I'm also gonna grab my age 80 81 82 luxy.
180 perhaps oh my god and dip it into a.
Little bit more of hoola bronzer just to.
Lightly contour my nose i'm actually not.
Gonna do the very signature snatched.
James charles nose i just want to do a.
Light contour just a little something.
But definitely not super super intense.
Because it's just gonna look very very.
Wonky with this look because we do want.
To go for that natural more dewy skin.
All right so you guys know i'm a very.
Very loyal more if you stand up but.
There's one nod morphing brush that i.
Have been absolutely obsessive lately.
And that is the makeup shack t89 brush.
It's just this fluffy brush and i am.
Gonna grab this using my kat von d shade.
And light palette and i'm gonna tip into.
It the darkest shade of the contour.
Palette and i am going to definitely.
Dust off that brush because i don't want.
Too much but i've been loving this brush.
For just going in the very very very.
Hollow of my cheek bone right in the.
Bottom of that contour i feel like it.
Really defines the contour so well it.
Also allows you to blend it out so you.
Don't get that like really really harsh.
Light but it definitely does look super.
Super cut and defined and natural and.
Then of course i'm just gonna go back.
Into my original m 574 morphe and just.
Blend that oh and like oh my god look at.
How good that looks it looks like a.
Natural super super defined angelina.
Jolie cheekbone i freaking love these.
Two brushes together it's a match made.
In heaven.
I don't want to bake today just because.
I do want my skin to be really really.
Moist and hydrated but the one thing i.
Am gonna do is guy my beauty blender i.
Just admit to a tiny bit of that setting.
Powder and just lock in the sides of my.
Nose just to snatch that nose contour a.
Little bit and just to hold it in place.
Because it's already getting oily.
Because of these studio lights in front.
Of me and it is very very hot in.
California today so i definitely don't.
My nose to melt.
Okay finally i can take this stupid.
Headband off and replace it with my huh.
Thank god alright so for blush today you.
Guys know that i usually use mac peaches.
This is my all-time favorite blush but.
For today i'm actually gonna exchange.
That and i'm going to be using the mac.
Blushes in the shade spring sheen.
Instead this is actually a very very.
Similar color to peaches when you put.
Them next to each other but spring sheen.
Does have a little bit of shimmer to it.
Which is perfect because we definitely.
Want that radiant skin look and we are.
Gonna be using a lot of gold tone.
Highlighter as well so this will just do.
A good job of mending everything.
Together alright so i just went ahead.
And quickly did my brows and my eye.
Primer off-camera and you guys have seen.
Me do a million times out there is no.
Point in including it let's go ahead and.
Get started well we're all waiting for.
And that is the eye shadow so for this i.
Said a look today i'm gonna use in the.
Morphe x chocolate hill eyes shadow.
Palette now obviously this look is.
Mostly black land we're just a pinch of.
Brown and warm tone orange but this.
Palette is just so freakin bomb and so.
Pigmented as i'm sure you've heard it.
Literally everybody and their mothers.
Say it but it is actually true so if.
You're watching this today on monday the.
17th this palette is actually.
Relaunching and coming back in stock.
Tomorrow tuesday the 18th and i know so.
Many of you guys missed you rich in the.
Launch it's sold out at only 45 minutes.
And i know not a lot of people were able.
To get their hands on them which is why.
I'm doing the giveaway in the beginning.
Of the video like to talk about so if.
You have not thumbs up this video and.
Comment it down below definitely go do.
That but like i said this will be.
Restocking tomorrow so if you would like.
00 a.m. and.
You can use code jinx for 10% off your.
Purchase this palette is something you.
Need in your collection i am not kidding.
When i say it is so beyond good before.
We get into the actual liner i do just.
Want her to find my crease a little bit.
And for this i'm gonna grab my morphe.
M43 3 brush and dip into the shade.
Butter and just put this right into the.
Crease this step is definitely not vital.
You can totally skip out and go right to.
The liner portion but since i did it.
Prime my eyelids with some concealer and.
Not like a transparent primer i do just.
Want to add a little bit of dimension.
Back into my eyelid but that's just.
Personal preference i'm going to take a.
Quick break from the palette for a.
Second and i'm gonna grab my inglot gel.
Liner in the shade block obviously to.
Start off this wing and just catch this.
Out i'm gonna use my sigma e06 winged.
Liner brush.
It has been so long stuck on a winged.
Liner using a gel liner my hands are.
Shaking so hardcore  some reason i.
Don't know why i'm like still nervous to.
Do this oh my god with this liner i'm.
Also going to make sure to tight line up.
My waterline as well because there's.
Definitely a very very smoky look going.
On alright so i just went ahead and i.
Tight line off-camera using my edge away.
A black pencil clearly that's the.
Tration was not working out too well and.
I do not want to risk anything again and.
Of course i still managed to somehow.
Smudge black liner onto my lid but you.
Know what we're just gonna do with it.
We're gonna move on alright so going.
Back to my tiny little liner brush i'm.
Gonna dip into the english eyeliner one.
Last time i'm gonna draw this little.
Wing in the center corner of the eye.
Look this is obviously featured in kim's.
Look and this is a very very popular.
Technique in arabic makeup that just is.
So so freakin beautiful i personally.
Have a very very hard time doing this.
Because i do have a little bit of skin.
That actually covers my inner corner but.
I'm just gonna draw over it and hope.
That it it works kind of now going back.
Into thor female i'm gonna grab my two.
One two brush and i'm just gonna dip.
Into the shade abyss which is just this.
Black in the bottom corner it is so.
Freaking pigmented and we were going to.
Use that shade to smoke out our liner.
Today.
This looks awful okay this literally.
Looks awful so i'm going to try to take.
Off the outer wing portion how you asked.
I have no idea all right now that the.
Wing isn't taking up our entire eyelid.
Let's go ahead and try this again my two.
One two once again at dipping into abyss.
Let's go ahead and smoke out this liner.
Very very carefully the nerves degree of.
My makeup shakti to brush and i'm just.
Going to smoke out the edges at once.
Again and then finally my morphe m56 one.
Okay honestly for an i we had a.
Completely performing surgery on and.
This really did not turn out that bad.
Thank god i'm not going to go mighty to.
Brush and dab back into a best and i'm.
Going to smoke out the lower lash line.
As well i'm just keeping this color.
Super super close to the lash line.
Because we do want that smoky effect but.
Not bringing it down too low because we.
Don't want to be really really.
Overpowering and we're essentially.
Making sure to really concert that color.
On at the outer corner and connecting up.
To the way to really like circulate and.
Complete the eye i'm gonna go to the my.
M56 one brush and just buff over the.
Edge to make sure it's not going too low.
As you can see this look is actually.
Super super simple to achieve it just.
Looks complicated and you definitely to.
Be careful because the black.
I can definitely end up everywhere as.
You just saw so just be careful when.
You're blending but let's go ahead and.
Move on to it the lashes so for the.
Lashes today i definitely do something.
Very natural in the picture of kim who's.
Actually only wearing mascara which.
Makes me so freakin angry like oh the.
Fact that anybody can have natural.
Lashes that good is so beyond me because.
Unfortunately i cannot relate so for the.
Lashes today i just want to use the.
Ardell demi whispies these are a very.
Brave natural pair i used to use these.
On all the girls in my local hometown.
When i did their prom makeup they're.
Just very very beautiful but definitely.
Are just a little bit of.
Something-something so i'm just gonna.
Glue them on of course as always.
And then just to blend my regular lashes.
With my fake ones together i'm gonna.
Grab my benefit roller lash mascara and.
Just play a very very light coat.
So both eyes are now complete and of.
Course the next type is going to be the.
Glow i know i use this one all the time.
But for today i'm using my anasazi so.
Hollywood illuminator this is one of my.
All-time faves and for this look we.
Definitely do want to be super super.
Gold then i cannot think of a better.
Gold highlighter than this one and to.
Play uncle using my morphe emb 23 brush.
Oh wow yeah and you guys know normally i.
Would use my morphe m 501 brush this is.
Like my go-to highlighter but recently.
I've been actually loving using a.
Smaller brushes of four highlighters to.
Get like a more precise and confined.
Highlighter i don't know if you think.
I'm getting a board of like the look of.
Highlighter like everywhere all over the.
Face i doesn't really love you to look.
Like a natural natural tiny to find.
Highlighter moment i don't know personal.
Preference do whatever you want.
Oh my god yes this literally looks so.
Frickin pretty wow okay this area of my.
Forehead is actually still my favorite.
Places the highly on my entire face and.
I've been getting a lot of questions.
About it lately - everyone's like why.
The hell are you highlighting your.
Forehead i thought you wanted to make it.
Look smaller and well yes i definitely.
Do that is for sure when you sweat.
Obviously this way is going to hit the.
Light and it's gonna reflect naturally.
Where the light or where the liquid is.
On your face that's just how science.
Works wow.
So by adding highlighter here and making.
That light hit it and catch it it just.
Helps to kind of further along the look.
Of that dewy and not your foundation.
Because not all of us unfortunately can.
Be blessed with that beautiful glowing.
Skin but we got to fake it till we make.
It for lips today i'm first gonna go.
Into the dose of colors new lipstick in.
The shade.
Kim definitely was wearing a glossy lip.
As well so i'm gonna layer over top of.
The it mac lipglass in the shade.
See-through as well and then for one.
Final pop i'm just gonna layer these.
Away skinny dip lip topper right in the.
Center of the bottom lip just for a.
Little bit of gold glitter realness.
Oh i almost forgot to highlight my.
Collarbones as well alright guys and.
That is the kim k inspired arabic black.
Winged out smokey eye i freaking love.
How this lip turn out i think it is so.
Beautiful in sunny as i said before i.
