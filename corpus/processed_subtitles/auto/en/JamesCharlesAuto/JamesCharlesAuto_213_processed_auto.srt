Campaign video and photo shoot for my.
Sister collection with morphe oh my god.
A few days ago now we posted our.
Official reveal video upload my talent.
And my brush collection that i have.
Created over the past several months and.
Oh my god you guys i cannot even begin.
To explain how thankful and grateful i.
Am for all of your feedback and support.
This launch is literally going to wake.
Makeup history i'm so glad that i got to.
Partner with murphy because creating.
This collection has been so much fun and.
So incredible they have truly given me.
So much artistic freedom to really.
Create the collection that i wanted.
Forever as an artist and also as well i.
Got to produce my very own commercial.
For the entire collection which was so.
Much fun if you guys have not yet seen.
My reveal be to make sure it's like.
Right up here for the full on commercial.
And full review of the collection the.
Palette all the swatches the prices.
Every single brush that is in this brush.
Set it's a pretty good and beefy video.
And it's gonna have all the information.
That you're gonna want to know before.
You actually get the collection for.
Today's the do i want it to do a.
Tutorial and one of the looks for my.
Campaign commercial and that is the.
Image that is on all packaging for my.
Palette this iconic unleash your inner.
Artist look hello flaming i am obsessed.
With this look i love this and.
Ironically enough as well we honestly.
Shot the packaging photos for the.
Palette over six months ago now and.
Somehow this look happened to become a.
Trend in the big community a few months.
Ago which i thought was so so so funny.
So major sound us to all the artists out.
There for giving me a little bit of.
Promo before my product was even out co.
But in reality great minds do think.
Alike and i thought this is just be so.
Much fun to just thank you guys for all.
Your love and support and to give you.
Guys a cute little easy tutorial on this.
Campaign look today so that further ado.
Let's jump into this first ever tutorial.
Using my palette my brushes my.
Collection with morphe and let's unleash.
Our inner artists.
Music.
So my face is already completely on.
Because we just thought the music slips.
For the commercial this morning about.
I'm just going to uh oh ouch pop off my.
Lashes and add my look on top of this.
I'm first gonna go up in 4 3 3 brush and.
Dip into the shade escape and i'm going.
To pop this right on the outer corner.
And start tilly and like imagine it's.
Gonna be like a hello the outer v i.
Normally don't apply shadows like this.
Either but my goal for creating this.
Palette was to create really really.
Pigmented and fully matte eyeshadows.
Because it's saying that i've wanted in.
My kit as an artist literally since.
Starting in the makeup game and of.
Course it's been a lot of really really.
Bomb talent but one of the problems with.
Propellants i feel like is that they all.
Look so beautiful inside the actual.
Palette but a lot of the shadows don't.
Actually apply that pigmented onto the.
Skin but i really wanted to create a.
Really pigmented really bomb and really.
Really bright rainbow colors and through.
Doing that some of the matte shades are.
Either matte or some of them are.
Actually pressed pigments which means.
You just have to work with them in a.
Little bit of a different way and that.
Means packing on that shadow first next.
Thing we have another m 4-3-3 brush and.
Dip into the shade single which is that.
Lighter purple shade and i'm gonna use.
This too lightly diffuse out the edges.
I'm just gonna tuck that right into the.
Crease as well moving on we're gonna.
Come back to that in a little bath now.
That the purple's all place on the outer.
Corner and it's all set in place i'm.
Just going to grab an emma four-for-one.
Brush and dip into b which is the bright.
Yellow shade this is by far the best.
Bright yellow shadow i have ever tried.
Look at this ready hello oh my god like.
Literally you're kidding me.
And i was gonna pop this right on my.
Inner corner kind of letting into the.
Nose contour as well i just pull.
Something right into that crease region.
Next i'm going to grab another and 4-3-3.
Brush this is why i love this brush.
That's so so so much because they're.
Multiples of many of the different eye.
Brushes which make it so perfect for.
Doing rainbow looks like this you don't.
Have to wash your brushes in the middle.
Of them and you also don't have to buy a.
Million-two them from the website you.
Get them all at once in the brush kit so.
Good it's so fresh so helpful i went to.
This shade right into the bright red.
Which is called you're kidding.
Why is it called that you're gonna find.
Out when i put this on you're kidding.
Look at the pigmentation oh my god that.
Is like a true true true rad rad as all.
Of the shades that i was most excited.
About but also most nervous about.
Because firm leading a bright red shadow.
Is really really hard and i also feel.
Like it's something that is always.
Missing from every single palette i feel.
Like every read either reads a burnt.
Orange or magenta and i was like now i.
Want red like is it that hard and it was.
Apparently i was wrong but we did it and.
It looks bomb know that same exact brush.
I'm gonna dip into the shade of five on.
Eight which is the bright light orange.
Color.
I'm obsessed with this orange it is so.
Neon so cool and i'm going to just blend.
The yellow and red shades together so.
Now i'm going to take my favorite brush.
Of this entire collection this ladies.
And gentlemen is the m 4 5 6 so you're.
Probably thinking that's just another.
Fuzzy batch no it's not you guys know.
The emperor 33 is my ride-or-die okay i.
Literally have 36 of these in my makeup.
Collection and they all are covered and.
Dirty and a million different eye shadow.
Colors i love this brush i could.
Literally do an entire shadow look with.
This brush but now we have the m 4 5 6.
Which is literally a brush that i have.
Wanted to create since i started working.
With morphe so many years ago it is.
Literally the m-43 threes babies sister.
It is the same exact brush just half the.
Size now this brush is going to be so.
Perfect for those of you out there who.
Have a smaller eyes and still want to.
Create that beautiful blended look or if.
You people like me who have big eyes but.
Like to do kind of detailed rainbow.
Intricate blending looks this brush is.
Perfect because it still blows.
Everything out but you can really get.
Right in those crease regions to just.
Blend in to fuse that color without.
Getting it everywhere so i'm gonna dip.
This brush into the shade skip which is.
The bright neon pink and i'm gonna use.
This to connect the red and diffuse out.
The edge of the purple if you ever need.
To fix any blending describe your atom.
At 4 or 5 6 the perfect tiny blending.
Brush and just go right back in there.
Nextera grab by other at four five six.
That comes into the collection and dip.
Into the shade escape this is the darker.
Purple shade i'm gonna pop this right in.
The outer v to start creating some.
Dimension i'm just gonna put a little.
Bit more of that single shade into the.
Crease for some more dimension to for my.
Auto color i'm gonna grab my iva 506.
Brush from the brush tat i love this.
Tiny brush for blending out the outer v.
And dip into a little bit of the shade.
Of spooky deep blonde shade in the.
Palette i'm gonna be very very careful.
Cuz i don't want to add too much just.
Kind of patting that on there and.
Lightly blending it out and then going.
Back into the m four five six.
And there's escape so this is looking.
Messy right now we're obviously going to.
Clean it up do not worry so now we're at.
The stage where i want to cut the crease.
And lay down the rest of the shadows so.
I'm going to grab an damnit two to four.
Brush this is my favorite concealer and.
Just a thick white concealer and i'm.
Just gonna go right in on the inner.
Corner cutting my crease a little bit.
Bigger than normal and then governing to.
N43 one this is the little pencil brush.
From the kit i'm gonna grab a tiny bit.
More of that concealer on the paint.
Brush i just got a little bit off and.
I'm gonna go in and actually diffuse out.
Those edges because i don't want this to.
Be a crease i want it to be like a paper.
Cut crease now we're gonna have a one 6x.
Brush and dip into the white shade in.
The palette which is a flashback based.
On the most iconic internet meme of all.
Time i really wanted to make a super.
Pigmented white eye shadow because i.
Feel like these are really really really.
Hard to find and i also decided to place.
It in the middle row as well because a.
Lot of you guys love using white when it.
Comes to either track or theater or just.
Avant-garde looks in general i will say.
Confidently non bias as well this is by.
Far the best most pigmented white.
Eyeshadow i have ever tried or seen i.
Swear to god you could either put it on.
Once purchased a light little wash of.
White or the shadow does layer up and.
You can literally make it like bright.
White that's what i wait so good once.
That why i said it i'm just gonna take.
My original fluffy brushes and just go.
Lightly over those edges to even diffuse.
It a little bit more now to fix this.
Whole moment in here because this is.
Obviously not the tea i'm gonna add some.
Blue.
My ab12 for brush this is just a tiny.
Little packing brush and dip into the.
Shade acappella which is our metallic.
Blue shade and i'm gonna give it a.
Little bit of a spritz using the morphe.
Preppin set i'm gonna pack this shade.
Right on here that are dirty i'm four.
Five six i'm gonna grab the shade at.
Kolob which is our dark blue matte shade.
I'm obsessed with this color it is.
Obviously named after pepsi my favorite.
Soda just pop it right in there to make.
Sure the purple and blue are blended.
Together and then going back in and.
Blending this edge and on that same.
Brush the next under grab the shade.
Hello and pop that right in the middle.
Of that dark blue and the white just to.
Add some more dimension to the lid i'm.
Gonna use the peaches and cream at.
Glitter base and a few different.
Glitters that i have this one is from in.
Your dreams as well as from peaches and.
This one is from the craft store and i'm.
Just gonna pack that right over top of.
The white driving a little bit of that.
Chunkier glitter from in your dream just.
Gonna pop that on just lightly dabbing.
That on as well i do want to show the.
Glitter reflex but i don't want my.
Eyelid to literally feel crusty because.
That's the worst feeling in the entire.
World and then just finally some super.
Chunky pieces probably the craft store.
Just here and there now i definitely.
Have a little bit of fallout that is for.
Sure so i'm gonna grab the e48 brush i.
Love this brush for under-eye powder.
Ever is going to dust that all away and.
Pray that it actually goes away good.
Smells my palate is pigmented then to.
Finish off the upper lash center it's.
Gonna grab me a liquid black liner and.
Just go right over that to hide with the.
Wash that we're gonna put on it a little.
Bit the lower lash line for this look is.
Actually going to be pretty easy just.
Slopping on some colors i'm first gonna.
Grab a i'm a four five six that has a.
Little bit of the excess purple shade on.
It interested one more time into it.
Single and i'm gonna use this to blend.
Together this outer corner with my am.
One two four brush dipping into the.
Shade of brother deeper ice blue shade i.
Love this color it is obviously named.
After sister yan i'm just going to pop.
This right up against that lower lash.
There next to the purple this is another.
One of those shades that was really hard.
To formulate so you definitely want back.
The shades on there and then with the.
M15 - this is a tiny brush but i love.
This for buffing out the lower lash line.
I'm gonna dip into the bright green.
Shade which is called socialblade in.
Honor of all of you guys and my crazy.
Growth throughout this past year gotta.
Stay green always and i'm going to pop.
This right next to that blue.
And also creating a faux inner corner as.
Well now gonna go to the a before two.
One brush intimate ooh a little bit more.
Of that white concealer and i'm gonna.
Use this to create a new lower lash line.

Thing in the blue and then the same.
Thing would escape in the purple using a.
Tiny bit more of that peaches glitter.
