Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel i was.
Looking at my calendar a few days ago.
Because i'm doing some traveling.
Very very soon which i'm very excited.
About and i noticed that we were at the.
End of september which means october is.
Coming up sister's goofy month a.
Favorite time of the entire year.
Literally cannot wait but that also.
Means that my anniversary of the first.
Time that i ever put on makeup is coming.
Up in a few days and oh my god i am.
Literally so excited it is about to be.
Our three year sister bursary i.
Literally cannot believe this is do my.
Job for three years now i pinch myself.
Every single day and it's literally so.
Cool and i thought for our three year.
Anniversary we should do something very.
Very fun and good and fresh and special.
I'm working on one other video right now.
That you guys will see in a few short.
Weeks but it required me to go way back.
In time and open up the history books on.
Both my instagram and my youtube channel.
And through doing this i came across my.
First ever youtube video which i.
Literally have erased from my mind if.
You've been a longtime subscriber you.
Know that i have changed drastically so.
For today's video i want to react to.
This video and see what has changed i.
Know i've gotten way more comfortable on.
Camera my talking speed is probably.
Multiplied by literally a million at.
This point and i also would love to try.
To recreate the look and kind of.
Modernize and see how i would do the.
Same exact look in today's makeup skills.
I am praying that my makeup has gotten.
Way way way better oh yeah.
James 2016 sharpie eyebrows there's no.
Way i could even lose at this foolproof.
Plan without further ado let's pull up.
The first ever video and take a trip.
Down memory lane okay this video is.
Titled blue brown serpent before i even.
Finish that sentence literally why.
Makeup tutorial from jade charles beauty.
Have you been around since day one that.
Was very original instagram name before.
I got james charles this has five.
Hundred eighty-three thousand views oh.
Not bad.
And as posted two years ago.
Music.
Oh okay pause ah a second synonym.
Already horrified i forgot that i oh my.
God.
Okay okay before i had this really.
Beautiful good and fresh hair that i.
Loved i used to have a man dime and it.
Was bad disgusting and horrible and.
Cutting that off was probably one of the.
Best decisions i've ever made in my.
Entire life.
So in this video i am rocking gray man.
Bun which was a bad choice.
Sixteen-year-old makeup artist from new.
York and i run the instagram page to.
Change her on beauty lately sisters.
Another thing yet either.
This is so weird oh my god they're.
Talking so slow hi guys my name is james.
I'm a 16 year old makeup artist from new.
York and i run the instagram page j.
Charles beauty i don't even think i.
Could talk about that now if i tried for.
An entire video.
Music.
Music.
You know everything about this paused.
Who the man but being tied up and.
Besides not being shaved looks gross the.
Eyebrows are taking up half of my.
Already very large forehead i would love.
To know where i got trio chrome from.
Because the only color that i'm seeing.
Here is green but then again that could.
Be the fact that i was literally using.
One light to shoot this video that cost.
Me $50 from amazon my nose because of.
The contour looks like it's about a good.
Inch thick so we love that and my top.
Lip is not there oh my god i forgot i.
Look filler oh my god this is why make.
Sure to keep on watching hi guys i'm.
Gonna be starting off today using my.
Benefit porefessional primer i've been.
Million little bumps and pores all over.
My face so doing this would really help.
Me smooth everything out and get an even.
Foundation application next i'm going.
Into my la girl pro color corrector.
Concealer.
She's just a color correcting shadow and.
My aya literally cannot even tell you.
The last time i color corrected my face.
I think there were so many makeup trends.
One of them being color correcting that.
We're like so big at one point that now.
Literally nobody talked throughout if.
You don't have this problem obviously.
Don't color products because this is not.
Pumpkin glam but if you're like me and.
You get negative 15 hours to sleep this.
Might be for you i also get a solid 18 a.
Green color corrector also from le girl.
And then blended it out with my beauty.
Blender or its use the full coverage.
Foundation hd ultra foundation in the.
Shade y 255 and just putting a bunch of.
Little dots all over my face obviously.
We're gonna blend these out later on but.
It just helps create a really even.
Application that is yellow that is.
Literally yellow nothing has changed i.
Still can't match my foundation but good.
Lord we want a smooth transition and the.
Last thing we need is moses parting the.
Foundation see on your face oh my god i.
Literally thought i was.
Youtube's next comedian what is going on.
I'm using my la girl pro concealer in.
The shade porcelain woah my face in the.
Middle of my forehead in the middle of.
My chin on my moustache area and just.
One line down the center of my nose this.
Will just make all the high points of my.
Face to stand out and then once again a.
Blending out with my beauty blender now.
I'm setting my entire face using cody.
Cody or some powder let me tell you.
Great powder if you need to literally.
Lock in your makeup for the next eight.
Years this is what created flash like.
Mary that's all i need to say on that i.
Don't think i need to elaborate any.
Further reduce crease edge that's before.
I had a coupon code oh gonna put it in.
There now use go james for 10% off oh my.
God i didn't even have code james then.
This is so crazy here is control of this.
Color usually comes in the contour.
Palette but i actually deep hot in it.
And just put it in my z palette with all.
My other contour and highlight shades.
Once again i'm just putting everyone's e.
Palettes were a thing and everybody used.
To have like their little custom shadows.
And their pal that they bring everywhere.
Does anybody even still do that oh.
Nobody uses deepal because they had.
Their scandal moving on oops still hated.
The fun still hated the fife at that and.
Today nothing has changed whoo at least.
We found one similarity next to further.
Defined my contour i'm using the same.
Brushes before and make up a cocoa bear.
It isn't eyeshadow but i never use blush.
And i look so this really helps i just.
Warm everything up if you've been in the.
Make up community for a very long time.
You were probably very familiar with.
Makeup geek shadows because everybody.
Had pretty much their entire line makeup.
Geek shadows are some of the first ones.
That i ever ordered what i started doing.
Makeup the shadow that i just used coco.
Bear was one of my all-time favorites.
For brown smokey eyes and i just used it.
To contour my face i know you can't.
Really tell because the lighting is the.
Worst i'm already looking yellow because.
The foundation my contour is orange of.
Course the angles are gonna turn out.
That that when your brows look that ugly.
Oh my god i cannot believe that these.
Eyebrows literally were once mine they.
Still are not perfect now like they.
Could i'm sure be a whole lot better.
With the amount of hate comments that i.
Got on my eyebrows on a daily basis.
Which was an alarming amount for any.
Sixteen-year-old kid to be dealing with.
I don't know how it took me that long to.
Fix them the first day of convention i.
Ever went to i waited in line for over.
An hour to the meet and greet for.
Anasazi beverly hills and she had been.
Following me and she was like oh my god.
James i recognize you and i was.
Literally fangirling so excited and she.
Literally looked me right in the eyes.
And said you need your eyebrows they're.
Horrible like i swear to god i wish i.
Was kidding and in that moment i had.
Such a big ego at this time i was like.
Oh please and she literally sat there i.
Was like no you really need to tweeze.
Off like the entire bottom portion and.
Like lift them up and i was like oh.
Please lady they look fine.
I've actually if i had listened sooner.
We wouldn't have you know how to deal.
With this issue.
Although the hate sucked at the time.
Thank you honestly truly for the bottom.
Of my heart to everyone who ever left a.
Hate comment on my eyebrows i needed.
This like.
That's what they look like right there.
This entire look i use my morphe 35o.
Palette i'm using my murphy i'm four for.
One and once again just a medium brown.
Tone from the 35k palette i'm putting.
That in the inner and outer views of the.
Eyes and then just taking whatever.
Excess product is left and coming in.
Windshield wipers just to find that.
Crease okay honestly not gonna like my.
Tutorial skills back then although it.
May not have looked pretty we're pretty.
Decent like i will say no i definitely.
Get a lot of comments complaining that i.
Skipped through everything which i.
Definitely do but like how did you good.
To have a good explaining everything.
Here making sure it's like eventually.
All the right angles.
Good job sixteen year old me in the.
Waterline i'm just going in with the.
Italia deluxe i pencil in turquoise i.
Got this at the morphe store if you.
Don't have this eye pencil you can.
Easily just do black it's really up to.
You but i wanted another pop of color on.
The bottom i actually lost the clip but.
I did use the nyx jumbo eye pencil in.
Black bean just so mimic the halo effect.
That we have going on on the upper lid.
And then once i did that i'm just going.
Back under the lower lash line couple.
End everything out and connect it back.
Up to the top that was the longest.
Sentence i've ever heard my entire life.
Oh my god.
Queen of run-on sentences the speech.
Patterns really have not changed and.
Sinus i'm just going to burn mascara.
Benefit roller lash it's so good and.
Makes my lashes look so on and not.
Clumpy so i would definitely recommend i.
Stole my cameras today i use the.
Blackmagic lashes in siren i include my.
Eye shot what i try to do on camera so.
Definitely not going to do that again.
Anyway lesson learned.
That is true i talked about this a few.
Times before but when i first started.
Doing makeup.
I could not glue on eyelashes to save my.
Life probably because my eyebrows were.
Taking up half of my eye so i literally.
Could get no room in there and every.
Time that i tried i glued my eye shot.
Wish i was kidding.
Not so highly i'm just approaching my.
Brush again.
Sex+ to make it super to find and then.
Mixing these two colors for my anasazi.
Aglow camp now we pack that highly on.
Like there's no tomorrow.
Remember the goal is that your toilet.
Can be seen from space and that you.
Blind everybody walking by okay we get a.
Sweetie.
I always highlight my cheekbones the tip.
Of my nose and my cupids though just.
Because i think it looks cute.
I am scared at the size of a brush i.
Just use to highlight my nose oh my god.
This is why my nose looks like it is an.
Inch wide for my lips today i'm using.
Oprah brooklyn you guys always ask what.
Liquid lipsticks i like best and they're.
Definitely oprah the formulation is so.
Good and they don't dry crusty and girls.
Like so many other brands do true i.
Still stand by this and i love the.
Overlook a lipstick they're by far my.
Favorite formula of all time also keep.
The coupon code must have been over.
First.
This one was code j charles but now it's.
Co james it gets you 30% still to this.
Day my poor top left where was i even.
Putting the left stack at this point.
Like as an option last step i went ahead.
And i added houdini all over my lips.
Just for a cool jerome effect.
Oh and that guy's is the finished look.
If you enjoyed this tutorial and i will.
See you soon with a new video.
Music.
Well that was seven minutes of my life.
That i will never get back looking back.
At these videos for me is literally so.
Crazy i cannot believe it's already been.
Almost three years since i started doing.
This like it feels like it was yesterday.
But at the same time this person feels.
Foreign like who literally who is she.
Like the gray hair the man vaughn the.
Big nose contour the non-existent topped.
Lamp the eyebrows like wow i'm really.
Thankful for both the positivity and.
Also the negativity on youtube over the.
Past few years because it's made me a.
Way more confident person a way more.
Comfortable person a way happier person.
And also i won't say this with.
Confidence.
Oh hey better-looking person as well.
Thank god for this cologne personality.
Aside though the makeup in this video.
I'm horrified i actually don't think.
There was a single product or technique.
Honestly that i still use my everyday.
Makeup routine now that we've gotten.
Watching this out of the way thank god i.
Have all my favorite makeup products.
Here that i now use on an everyday at.
Daily basis and i want to try to.
Recreate this same exact look that.
Actually make it look really really bomb.
Really really beautiful and hopefully.
Actually show up and look nice and a.
Good studio setup so let's get clean.
Alright so starting off my routine today.
I am not going to be color correcting i.
Have probably not color corrected it.
Honestly probably since that video so.
For a foundation today i'm gonna go to.
The born this way foundation from too.
Faced you guys know this is my all time.
A holy girl favourite in the original.
Video i was using the make up for ever.
Ultra hd liquid foundation which i.
Actually think is kind of funny because.
If you know me and even around for a.
Very very long time you know that before.
Born this way i was actually using the.
Makeup forever stick foundation and that.
Was kind of like my holy grail that i.
Used forever so i don't even know why i.
Was using the liquid version in that.
Video because i generally cannot ever.
Remember liking that but guess i did so.
End up on the sin i was gonna be using.
The morphe cod or highlighting sponge i.
Absolutely love this one if you want to.
Get this these co j's for 10% off.
Putting it in now since i apparently.
Couldn't.
Three years ago cuz had a good shade.
Match i still can't tell what are you.
Three years later i still don't know how.
To match my foundation once ai.
Foundation all over my actual face i'm.
Gonna grab just a big fluffy foundation.
Brush and dip into the same color and.
This one this all down my neck.
Apparently i did not know how to.
Two years ago despite the fact that i.
Literally made a joke about moses.
Parting the foundation see still.
Couldn't match it so i'm gonna make sure.
That no matter what color my face is.
Today my neck is the same shade for good.
Suitors today and no surprises here i'm.
Just going to get my shape tape.
Concealer this one's gonna be in the.
Shade affair and i also have the shade.
Light natural to mix together as well.
Because this one is a little bit light.
Definitely do not want to be rushed back.
Mary that is for sure i think in the.
Original video i was using the la girl.
Pro concealer i actually still like that.
Concealer a lot but shaving peepers.
Definitely a lot more full coverage the.
One thing that i probably changed the.
Most and like my makeup process aside.
For my eyebrows of course it's probably.
My base routine which i'm really really.
Thankful for i used to use a super super.
Full coverage foundation and super full.
Coverage concealer and then pack it on.
With cody or some powder which looked.
Really nice of course for like instagram.
Pictures which is literally the only.
Thing that i was doing but once i.
Actually started wearing makeup out.
Though and like actually being in the.
Real world and taking selfies and.
Looking in mirrors i quickly realized.
How disgusting it looked because it was.
So incredibly cakey and the one change.
That i really made now is i definitely.
Prefer a really really light coverage.
Foundation but just a more full coverage.
Concealer so i can really focus the.
Coverage in the areas that i need it and.
Actually like my normal skin shine.
Through i've worked really really hard.
To clear out my skin and have a good.
Skin and definite like to show it off.
And i think it's just a lot better a lot.
More natural as well so definitely like.
My base routine now a million times more.
All right so everything is blended in.
But i'm looking a little bit light.
Hi mr. spooked first or i want to set my.
Face in place and add some dimension.
Back as quickly as possible so first.
Today i'm gonna go to the too faced.
Peach perfect setting powder.
I'll let the cody air some powder it's.
Actually not ridiculously drying it's.
Definitely more of like a light coverage.
Powder i actually really liked the fact.
That this kind of wears down a little.
Bit throughout the day call me crazy but.
My favorite time of like makeup is.
Probably two to three hours after wear.
But it's still looking really really.
Beautiful but by that time some of your.
Like natural oils have kind of seeped.
Through you know that sounds really.
Gross i just like it to look a little.
Bit more worn and i feel like it looks.
Much more natural and it kind of gets.
Rid of that like vanilla cake mix type.
Of look.
So this powder is definitely my all-time.
Favorite to achieve that look before i.
Actually move on to the next time i'm.
Gonna grab the morphe preppin set.
Setting spray i really really love this.
Because it has such a fine mist so i.
Always use this in-between of the stuff.
So a makeup routine whenever i apply a.
Lot of powder just kind of lock.
Everything more in place add a little.
Bit of hydration back and that really.
Prevents the cakiness that the other.
1 of different so next i'm going to.
Contour my face and guess what i'm not.
Gonna use an orange eyeshadow today i.
Have with me my anasazi beverly hills.
Contour kit.
I do have an orange in here but this i.
Use for blush so i'm just gonna got my.
Morphe emma 405 brush end up into this.
Cool tone right here on the bottom.
Corner i don't gonna use this to it just.
Chisel out my features i'm gonna go in.
With a little bit of a light hand with.
This as well i know by sound me recalled.
The contour in the video i ended up.
Looking like okay but i remember taking.
So many photos a long time ago where my.
Contour literally looked like a is.
Strike down my cheekbones it was so ugly.
Probably because i was using a dark.
Burnt orange eyeshadow for that but i.
Just wanna use a light hand and really.
Use this contour to chisel out my.
Natural features and not literally.
Create new ones because that's not the.
Point and it really does not look good.
Ever definitely still gonna better - the.
5head though definitely a contour out my.
Jaw line as well the one thing that i.
Noticed in that video oh my god by java.
Like definitely looked better two years.
Ago that it did now how did that even.
Happen that is literally so unfair i'm.
Calling the police.
I'm not gonna grab the m-52 7 which is a.
Bigger fluffy brush and dip into this.
Kind of more a warm tone caramel shade.
Right next door and i'm gonna use this.
It's kind of like a bronze or show you.
Just one together my natural skin tone.
And my contour eventually nose color i'm.
Gonna grab my jd weighty 182 brush and.
Dip into that middle shade in the.
Contour palette once again if you've.
Been around for a long time you would.
Know that my nose contour has really had.
A quite the dirty.
Clearly with this video i don't know how.
To do it period so that was great and.
Scary then i got really really good at.
It and now actually recently i haven't.
Even been compromised nose as much and.
I've really learned to embrace it a.
Little bit more kind of fun i love that.
Journey regardless i'm so good at.
Contour today and i'm gonna make it not.
Look an inch long because that looked.
About it so let's do that.
I'm gonna make sure to place those two.
Contour lines pretty close together and.
Blend them out and when it comes to.
Highlighting them later i'm not going to.
Use a big brush so hopefully that'll.
Help the illusion actually exists next.
Of course you guys know comes a blush.
And first i'm going to be using the mac.
Blush and the shaded peaches funny.
Enough in this video and actually for a.
Majority of my makeup career i do not.
Use a blush because i said that i didn't.
Like it for the longest time i really.
Felt as though like my cheekbones were.
For some reason too high and.
Couldn't fit blush on there i really.
Don't know where this thought process.
Came from it was truly so so so stupid.
But in my head at what i first started.
Doing makeup the only blush clothes that.
Existed was bright pink which i hated.
So finding peaches for me was like a.
Full-on like holy grail revival moment.
And now i love blush once again before i.
Move on to the next time i'm just gonna.
Do a light spread of the morphe prepping.
Settings right before we move on to the.
Next time i am still going to bake my.
Face but i'm just gonna bake it lightly.
As opposed to using a powder puff and.
Iris pilot like before i'm just gonna.
Grab my same beauty blender and dip into.
At the peach setting powder and just.
Place a slightly underneath any areas.
That i have contour just to bring some.
Of the highlights back by using a beauty.
Blender i'm really melting the product.
Into the skin which is actually so much.
Better when it comes to creasing and.
Bringing highlights back as opposed to a.
Powder puff which lauder just makes the.
Powder sit right on top.
Well that bakes in place on my face love.
All those rhymes that just happen right.
There.
Next i'm gonna move on to my brows now.
And you guys know just like the original.
Video i still to this day usually skip.
The brow process and do them off camera.
Because i don't like the angles of it.
But you know what.
In honor of today's video i thought i'd.
Be so much fun to celebrate my borough.
Transformation god bless and do a little.
Bit of a brow routine for you guys.
Because i have not done one in a very.
Very long time so why not.
To start off eyebrows today i'm gonna.
Use my anasazi a brow is in the shade.
And medium brown i really like using a.
Brow pencil mainly because a dip brow is.
What got me into the whole and james.
Charles brick sharpie brow from before.
But that's my fault for using it way too.
Heavy-handed but that's why i really.
Like a pencil because you can either use.
It really really lightly to create those.
Little hair light strokes in the front.
Of the brow or you can actually really.
Press down and layer on and give it a.
Much more defined look you really get.
The best of both worlds so i'm gonna go.
Right in and i'm gonna first it up by.
Using a spoolie and just to brush the.
Hairs upwards to see where my actual.
Brow is and then i'd like to go in and.
Start with the tail first.
I'm honestly really not sure why.
Probably because my original brow tail.
Literally used to end like here and i'm.
Like triggered over it so i always had.
To make sure that it's in the right.
Place at first before i anything else.
Gets put on there but i just like to.
Draw that little point then follow it up.
To the top that i always like to define.
The lower arch and bring it in i'm.
Holding the pencil so lightly when i do.
This as well literally applying like no.
Pressure at all once i get to the front.
Of the brow i'm just going to flick the.
Pencil upward to kind of create the.
Illusion.
Hair strokes i always like to put the.
Hair strokes in place at first and it's.
Okay if it looks a little bit messy of.
Course i had to go to the concealer.
After and clean everything once the.
Bottom of the brow is all taken care of.
And is truly all smooth sailing from.
Here i really just like to get that over.
With first because once again it can.
Really make her break the brow and i.
Definitely did not want to go back to it.
Straight bra from before so then once.
That's all in place i literally just.
Take the pencil and i kind of follow.
From this area right here that is really.
Dense and i literally just start to draw.
And it's super super light hair strokes.
And i'm filling in as i go as well and.
Then all i do literally once i get right.
Here it's just cool like that's so that.
Is the brow all filled in and it's.
Looking pretty good so far but it.
Definitely needs to be cleaned up quite.
A lot so next i'm just gonna grab that.
Same exact concealer from before and put.
A little dollop on the back of my hand.
And then just grabbing my super flat mac.
242 brush i'm gonna dip right in and i'm.
Gonna use this to clean up the bottom of.
My brow for me my brush automatically.
Goes right to the arch and i always pull.
It right underneath the tail and then.
With any excess product i just bring.
That right down to the front oh there we.
Go see stunty the nerds gonna use any.
Excess product on that brush and tap it.
Into my eyelid to act as an eyelid.
Primer to get it ready for eyeshadow i'm.
Just gonna grab my morphe e 20 brush and.
Dip into it once again at that same.
Exact setting powder and just lightly.
Place this right on top when it comes to.
The setting powder just like my face i'm.
Actually not gonna like we set it in.
There just because i shadows tend to.
Stick better and be a lot more pigmented.
When they're kind of blended over.
Something a little bit tacky and now we.
Were officially ready to recreate this.
Blue green brown trio chrome serpent.
Okay so for the eyeshadow look today i.
Don't actually have like a clear image.
Of what i want to do which is pretty.
Rare for me i usually have like a vision.
And then just go right in but being that.
The original look was so bad and also so.
Poorly documented because the lighting i.
Don't even know what this was supposed.
To look like so what i'm just gonna like.
Throw something together that would.
Remind me now of like serpent.
Well even like why would know why i got.
That i think i'm just gonna start off.
Doing this i look in the same order as.
The original video and see where it goes.
I'm gonna start off by grabbing my.
Morphe m4 33.
Stepping into a light cool tone brown.
Shade and is putting that right in the.
Crease i'm just going to blend this very.
Very lightly i'm gonna grab that i'm.
Five-eleven.
And put more of that on there because i.
Have a feeling that this is gonna get.
Pretty dark now i'm gonna grab at the m4.
33 again and tip into a little bit of a.
Darker tone brown i'm gonna place that.
In the crease to add a little bit more.
Dimension into this i literally don't.
Know what i want to do it for this.
Eyeshadow look i know in the original it.
Looked like i was using a like teal aqua.
Metallic shade all over the lid and then.
I put like a metallic light green in the.
Center but then i called it blue.
Somewhere there was blue in the.
Waterline and it's going in pretty.
Lightly and using back and forth motions.
Using the excess product that's still.
Left on this brush just make sure that.
There's an even transition between it.
That light brown and the darker brown.
Shade it's looking at pretty good so far.
But i don't really know what i'm doing.
So i'm gonna go the ab 178 brush it's.
That i just a tiny little concealer.
Brush and dip into a metallic like aqua.
Watery looking shade oh that's pretty.
Ot that looks good okay okay okay okay.
No places over here as well i guess i'm.
Just gonna fill this into a layer of the.
Blue over top i'm just gonna mix.
Together a dark blue and a dark green.
And put this right up in here to blend.
This together because i don't want this.
Halo eye to be like really really cut so.
This whole mix that brown and the blue.
Together i really should've done this.
Before placing that metallic shade on.
There because now this metallic sheen is.
Gonna get in the crease but everybody.
Makes mistakes and this original look.
Was one of them so before i move on to.
Us let's halo eye i'm gonna grab that.
Dark brown shade again and just go right.
Over that little area because that.
Blending is scary.
Oh that looks way better great moving on.
Let's forget about that please okay so.
Now i need to make the halo eye look.
Like an actual halo eye duh so i'm gonna.
Grab an e 37 it's actually a little.
Liner brush i know most people like to.
Use a little pocket brush for their halo.
Eyes but for some reason i have like.
This weird flap of skin that covers my.
Inner corner really rude really annoying.
Do not ask for it to be there but i.
Really need to like tuck shadow into.
That region so what i'm gonna do is grab.
The.
Blue in the dark green once again that i.
Just used to darken the crease and place.
That right up in there i'm gonna pull.
That right and on top of that metallic.
Shade oh yeah this looks good and we're.
Just gonna pull that color combo into.
Like a v-shape in the outer corner you.
Guys know i love really waiting out my.
Shadow even honestly if we're like.
Around looks like a halo eye i'll still.
Wing it out just a little bit for some.
Reason round.
Eye looks just really it's not flat on.
My face shape so just kind of wing it.
Out for a real one then we got that dark.
Brown once again and i'm going to go.
Over that outer edge and blend that.
Because it's already looking ugly and i.
Don't want to make it look any worse i'm.
Now gonna grab my nat 2 4 brush and i'm.
Gonna dip into a lighter aqua shade and.
I'm gonna put this after spritzing it.
Right on the center of the layer to.
Further accentuate the halo moment okay.
Now i'm happy where the woowoo god bless.
Okay so i'm gonna leave the shadow how.
It is because at this point i am.
Horrified at making this look worse i.
Cannot have my three year anniversary.
Video be equally as bad as the first one.
So what i am going to do though is grab.
The urban decay liner in the shade of.
Distortion and it's like this bluey.
Green purple glitter moment it's a.
Serpent and i'm just gonna put this.
Glitter right on that cut crease moment.
To really make it shine and i'm gonna.
Pull that right down as well right into.
The center of that halo eye i'm gonna.
Grab this powder brush and dust off the.
Fallout because there's a lot of it for.
Some reason now for the lower lash line.
I think i'm going to mimic the halo onto.
The lower lash line as well it's been a.
Long day i'm first gonna grab but this.
Brush is the m 149 and i'm going to tap.
Into the dark blue and green shades once.
Again and put those right up against the.
Lash and then i was gonna use that same.
Fluffy brush from before and grab the.
Light brown shade and go right below.
That lightly just connecting at that.
Outer v a transition color right into.
Deep blue just to tie everything.
Together.
Could i put the same aqua shade on the.
Lower lash line as well then it's gonna.
Place that teal shade right.
In the middle then just got me a little.
Bit of the mermaid's pigment from.
Peaches makeup one of my all-time.
Favorite brands when it comes to colitas.
And pigments and popping up right in the.
Center oh that's pretty.
Wow one thing goes right whoa okay so.
Next i want to highlight my brow bone.
And the inner corner just to add more.
Dimension to this eye look so it'll.
Really tart pigment in the shade of top.
Yacht i absolutely love this for.
Highlighting it's literally one of the.
Brightest things i've ever seen in my.
Entire life and i'm going to place that.
Right in there oh so pretty okay then.
Right on the brow bone for lashes of.
Course you guys should know at this.
Point i'm gonna use my all-time.
Favorites lily lashes in the style on.
Miami you can use code james for 15% off.
Your purchase lily as well but i'm going.
To trim them first to avoid the whole.
Wonky loss situation and gluing my eye.
Shot because that is not fun um so what.
I'm gonna do is just grab these with a.
Pair of tweezers and i'm gonna cut off a.
Spike from each end just so they fit my.
Eyes a little bit better then i'm gonna.
Apply a light layer of the duo of brush.
On and glue and then while that's.
Getting tacky i'm gonna pop on a really.
Light coat of the mac extended play out.
Mascara and then looking at my we're.
From right below i'm gonna hold this.
Lash up and i'm gonna plop it right onto.
My lash line finishing it off with a.
Little bit of mascara right on the lower.
Lash line that was quite the journey.
There is lots of bumps in the road but.
We got there in the end are we looking.
The best no.
Are we looking okay that's for you to.
Decide but regardless that is one blue.
Green and brown trio chrome serpent i.
Complete i'm not going through the other.
One off camera so i don't literally die.
In the next few minutes but i'll be.
Right back to finish how threats of this.
Block be right back.
Let's go ahead and finish the rest of.
This look before i decide that i hate it.
Again our first finisher left by just.
Wiping away this bake that's been.
Sitting here for like literally eight.
Hours now while i finished those eyes.
I'm also going to wipe off the excess.
Underneath my.
Oddballs as well so next was going to be.
Our highlighter but before we do that.
Once again i'm gonna grab my trusty at.
Prepping set setting spray and just meld.
Everything together and this also is.
Gonna be the highlighter stick a whole.
Lot more too so we get that really.
Blinding glow and for my hair today i'm.
Gonna grab not a large brush this is the.
A 501 great highlighter brush that won't.
Ruin my entire face that makeup and i'm.
Just going to dip into my highlighter.
Pop that right on the cheekbone and now.
For the nose highlight what i'm going to.
Do is not grab a large fluffy brush this.
Is the e36 it is a tiny pencil brush and.
I'm going to use this to highlight the.
Tip of my nose wow look at that so tiny.
So beautiful and not an inch wide.
That is how i notice how it's supposed.
To look okay so far less if we have the.
Lips now in my original video i did a.
Chocolate brown lip with a green and.
Blue pigment over top sorry we're not.
Doing that today because that looked.
Disgusting so what i'm going to do.
Instead is take a lip that is much more.
Flattering to this look and nude i'm.
Gonna start by lining them using my.
All-time favorite lip liner this is from.
Colour-pop x i love sonic e in the shade.
Curvy and then over top i'm gonna grab.
The anasazi liquid lipstick in the shade.
It stripped and just put that right in.
The middle and while i definitely do not.
Want to put on a blue green pigment what.
I am gonna do just to finish off the lip.
Today is out on a tiny bit of gloss.
Right in the center just to give it a.
Little bit more a dimension all right.
You guys we're gonna finish it off with.
Some sister settings mary one last time.
Just to lock everything in place and.
Finally that is the completed blue brown.
Green serpent.
A child.
