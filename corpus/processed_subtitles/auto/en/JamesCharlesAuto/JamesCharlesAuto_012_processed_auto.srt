Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel.
Normally in my intros i tell you guys.
What we're going to be doing in today's.
Video but judging by the title.
And my voice i think you already know.
What's going on this morning i was.
Sitting with my team talking about video.
Ideas.
And lewis was like james you need to do.
An asmr video.
And i was like i already did and then i.
Realized.
I didn't so now we're here in case you.
Don't know what asmr is it stands for.
Autonomous sensory meridian response oh.
Look at me.
A lot of different people love watching.
Asmr videos for different reasons.
Some people it helps them calm down and.
Help some people fall asleep.
It reduces anxiety and a lot of times as.
Well there are certain.
Sounds.
And there's certain sounds oh my god.
There's certain sounds that give people.
The tingles and can really help them out.
Which i think is.
Super cool i've watched a lot of asmr.
Videos i respect the art i respect the.
Youtubers for me personally.
They don't give me those like tingly.
Sensations i wish that they did but who.
Knows i'm always open to trying things.
And maybe in today's video i'll.
Experience it so if you want to.
Unwind if you want to relax and just get.
Glam together and asmr keep on watching.
All right sisters we're going to go.
Ahead and get started of course the.
First step to my makeup routine is.
Always going to be a primer.
And today i'm going to grab the milk.
Hydro grip.
What don't say that this needs to be.
Relaxing.
I don't know oh.
And i'm just going to rub this all over.
My face.
Oh.
I'm using some dragon beauty color.
Corrector to really get rid of my beard.
Here i would rather not as a viewer that.
Would make me rather uncomfortable.
Water bottle okay.
That's a good one i'm just gonna take.
Some powder.
And set that in place.
Patting it it's gonna be time for some.
Foundation and i'm gonna mix together a.
Few my favorites.

Really just blending all the colors in.
Together.
Let's full coverage that's okay if i.
Could use me for foundation i would.
I'm gonna use my beauty blender.
Hey some artists is that what they're.
Called that's such a cute name to be.
Honest.
What are some of your favorite sounds.
That give you the tingles.
Like sexual.
Oh what is that like that you're getting.
A facial i can honestly see if that will.
Be really relaxing.
Well look at how nice that foundation.
Looks right there with like that harsh.
Line i didn't even do that on purpose.
That's good i'm gonna grab my fenty.
Beauty contour stick.
And i'm just gonna take this stick and.
Start adding some color to the face.
Use a rare beauty foundation brush i've.
Been loving this brush recently for.
Foundation and cream contour it's.

Blush so i'm going to grab.
My favorite of recently which has been.
The rare beauty blush in the shade of.
Bliss.
This is also one of the recommended.
Products from an assessor selena gomez.
And the damning celebrities video and i.
Have loved this ever since i tried it.
Out.
Finally i'm gonna grab some tarte shape.
Tape concealer.
That's stupid.
When i first started doing makeup i used.
To use literally like an ounce concealer.
Every time doing the full-on like.
Stripes painting everywhere but now i've.
Really realized that less.
Is more dab dab dab dab dab it's not.
Good.
If i give you the tingles yeah yeah.
Really.
Yeah okay okay this is looking beautiful.
Now i'm gonna cut my powder.
Okay and i'm gonna grab my powder puff.

Tastes like beaches.
Beautiful.

To reinforce my contours and blushes and.
Highlights.
Quickly using a little bit of powder.
Music.
Music.
Oh.
Why is it tricky.
I just need to drive my settings by.
Really quickly.
Can you hear that all right sisters i'm.
Back.
I decided to do my other brow off camera.
Because honestly i was getting bored and.
Whispering is a lot more tiring than i.
Would have thought.
I'm back and we're gonna finish up the.
Rest of my makeup routine i'm gonna grab.
My eyelash curler from mac.
Cosmetics that's probably not very.
Satisfying.
And i'm just going to give my lashes a.
Nice girl same thing on this eye.
And then i'm going to grab my benefit.
Roller lash mascara.
I'm just going to carefully rub this.
Through the lashes making sure to not.
Get any on my eyelids.
Wiggle wiggle wiggle i was going to glue.
On lashes but honestly.
My regular lashes are looking so cute.
Today i don't even know if i need them.

The end is near you guys give me a few.
Steps left.
