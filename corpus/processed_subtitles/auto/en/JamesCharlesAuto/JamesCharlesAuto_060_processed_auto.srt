All the things like all the kinds of.
Music i like which i like a lot of.
Different kinds yeah it's a celebration.
Of not having to be one genre yeah.
They're stuck in any box right.
Obviously animal in campbell were very.
Like party crazy.
And that's why was that so would you say.
That your albums are definitely like an.
Accurate presentation of like where you.
Are in life yeah it's like a snapshot.
Into what my life is like yeah that was.
It like 22 for me mm-hmm.
So it was a bit of an animal and with.
A cannibal and i wrote that song.
Cannibal about eating man i wrote with.
My mom no way ok that's fun one thing.
That i know about you that people might.
Not is it you write a lot of your own.
Sauce right for other people as well.
Ok do you want to talk about that a.
Little bit because i'm back ok so you.
Never end for i'm so curious you help.
Right till the world ends for me yeah ok.
You wrote for miley cyrus veronica's i.
Wrote a song for them ages ago i've.
Written like collaborated with i mean a.
Bunch of people like pitbull and.
Macklemore and most recently big freedia.
Yes  raising hell i really want to get.
Into music which i would talk to you.
About later on but yourselves like.
Singing you're gonna have to sing on.
This channel well i have so i'm ready to.
Be a solo process because it's so hard.
To do another thing on makeup to me is.
So impressive well this is good then.
Then we can be beneficial how does the.
Songwriting process work for you because.
You know had a lot of box let's be real.
A lot of box music i don't like love it.
And this new record i have just embraced.
The fact that i like really like pop.
Music yeah and i can just be an.
Unapologetic cheesy    sometimes.
Yeah so i liked it i thought i want to.
Put on a little bit of concealer just to.
Cover up a nice condor i dark ness but i.
Also want to keep the freckles there cuz.
That's where most of them are so it's a.
Little bit of this i'm gonna use the.
Morphe contour stack and this is number.
13 okay to relate cheslow kisses at.
Cheekbones here and give her a nice good.
Uplift and snotch love your dog oh i.
Will give you the best so you've done a.
Lot of collabs as well as one thing that.
I've noticed about your albums which i.
03.
Real friends.
That's old cut yeah yeah i told you a.
Benefit macklemore maybe pop like.
Everybody okay so you wanna hear a funny.
Story about that he pops on shore home.
Dirty love that song i started.
A co-write or arianna and then like it.
Started just getting like a little.
Nastier and nastier and this was a while.
Ago and i was like i think i might just.
Be like two two branches roger and then.
I found out that dirty love in england.
Means that's very familiar then i and.
Then i collaborated iggy pop on it was.
Like my all-time favorite really i was.
In the house career favorite club is.
Been what egg you pop you the answer i.
Mean iggy pop's like a god to me yeah.
But like so is beyonce so it's like my.
Musical taste is right if you can come.
Up with anybody who would you pick and.
Why mm-hmm in the world yeah well i.
Would have like multiple answers dead or.
Alive.
Sure okay so i probably do bowie oh yeah.
In the pop world i would yeah i'll be.
Everything on your new album you have a.
Song that is featuring yourself but with.
The money sign yeah in the name you know.
A little bit throwback but also just.
Reclaiming the part of my waist it goes.
Integral in greeting yeah ted talk we.
Are who we are like those songs are like.
Literally how everybody like fell in.
Love with you so i always really excited.
To see that it was like making a little.
Comeback for me yeah the song you're.
Talking about it's called kinky oh okay.
That one's it's like a celebration of.
Having like obviously rainbow was a.
Major depart from what your first two.
Albums were yeah but it was just such a.
Beautiful story so i think it's really.
Cool to kind of come back and might be.
Full circle which is like everything.
Well i think that rainbow and i do.
Address obviously some like more serious.
Things that i had quite frankly with.
Sick of hearing people be like oh you.
Can't say you can't say when we're.
Using autotune is like a very obvious.
Yes we weren't trying to hide any of.
That so i'm rainbows i just really.
Wanted it to be like there's no effects.
There's no kind of gimmicky stuff.
Happening it's just my voice my.
Songwriting and little more serious on.
This album i just wanted to like you're.
Allowed to be happy we're all allowed to.
Be happy and we all should be happy and.
Doesn't matter if you go through.
Something that's terrible and you may.
Never get over it but you can try to.
Move on milik present and happy and.
Joyful in here in the fact that we're.
Alive today that's something that.
Personally i'm struggling with a lot.
Right now from just things that have.
Happened this past year as well so i'm.
Really excited personally to listen and.
Kind of go on that journey with you yeah.
One thing that i definitely ask you.
About because you're mentioning that you.
Were tired of hearing people say that.
You couldn't sing one my favorite songs.
From you ever is praying and it's just.
Such a beautiful song with a beautiful.
Message behind it but beautiful message.
Aside did you know that it went viral on.
Tik-tok and there was a challenger on.
That okay okay.
Tick tock and nice hot dog but uh there.
Was a whole entire challenge dedicated.
To people turn the head man it's an app.
Right it's it's just i use know i can.
Hit in my vocal range can you edit like.
Huh that's so i'm not even trying to do.
It i don't know how you doing it's so.
Hard but he hates your voice into like a.
Other plant and yo i can't believe you.
Just have that note yeah babies our god.
Is the beanie on your music career right.
Here right now oh if that's what they're.
Anyway music right i think it just ended.
Right here right now as well okay i'm.
Gonna add something nice blast you as.
Well i really want to i like a nice.
Peachy pink moment i want to clean up.
The side of your nose a little bit.
Please do when i don't up contour my.
Nose versus when i knew and.
That was done right yeah you have a.
Really good shaped nose to do a insane.
Nose contour on if you'd like look.
Forward just like look at this side of.
Here now it was like little like can you.
Even breathe right now i'm so sorry.
You're having breathing problems.
Currently herod tried that not in about.
Three months okay i'm gonna grab a.
Little bit of a face how about my mini.
Palette we're just gonna pop them on cuz.
Just cheekbones for a really good do we.
Look i really want her skin to just.
Literally look like it's going from.
Within that is pretty much our bates all.
Done so we're gonna move on to the eyes.
Now okay let me get to use the brand new.
Casseroles palette so let's get ready in.
The sun well makeup okay yeah let's go.
What are we getting ready for our party.
I don't know.
Oh you ain't not quite although you know.
I don't party oh yeah but she never were.
In my shot i may be tempted to say yes.
To be quite oh yes we're gonna drink.
Water and we are gonna paint my face.
Okay well i don't need to really do.
Anything to your brows to be right on.
Those yeah i think it looks really good.
Okay so first of all love the clothes.
Right at the top i love that you did not.
Just release a palette of neutral colors.
Like i couldn't know right and that's my.
Heart.
There are a lot of people that are.
Releasing make appliance which i think.
Is amazing because it's always fun to.
Add new things to the market but at the.
Same time i think that there's also.
Something would really make apply.
Instead it doesn't quite make sense i.
Think this makes perfect sense for you i.
Mean yeah so i really had to understand.
What people would want from me right.
When i think of tessa i think of a party.
Crazy colorful glitter because very.
Grateful you put a few glitter yeah they.
Can go like on top of whatever a daytime.
Look you have going on or.
Intensify or whatever my feelings makes.
A lot of sense for you and your brand so.
I was very excited to see that because.
It just like feels very genuine okay.
And i wonder singly beautiful today i.
Thought it'd be really fun to do a.
Matching outlook tool that i have on now.
But do a pop of blue because this is.
Literally one of the most stunning.
Shadows that i've ever seen on the lower.
Person instead of the green and maybe on.
Some glitter in there too beautiful and.
Like fun fact any of the matte ones if.
You had water to them they become way.
More pigmented really oh just don't have.
A fun track for all that and then the.
Shimmer you know they're super shimmery.
But play and see what we can come up.
With you have a little bit of concealer.
For her base let's do one eye on camera.
And then we can i was about to go in you.
Want the cmas alien skin flap.
Yeah literally i've never had some what.
Would even be the husband alien yeah oh.
My god mother cross and you can hit the.
Notes for this little flap of skin makes.
Doing makeup sometimes very very.
Difficult we both an alien skin yeah.
This what i call mine oh hey mom another.
Lovingly yeah no i love like we're from.
Another planet okay that's a good thing.
To calm it i have literally never seen.
Anybody else would that flap of skin.
There but yeah we like utilize it and.
Put shimmer on it and just like play.
With it yeah a little buffing brush and.
Dip into backstabber.
Love the shade names in this they're all.
Named after songs right there are songs.
That are old school if you know the deep.
Cuts and some are on the new record and.
One of them is unreleased oh will it be.
Released.
Oh it's a secret plan okay i'm just.
Gonna pop this into your outer v little.
Area right in here and we're going to.
Blend at that in a second.
I want to know what made you want to.
Create i'm making one in the first place.
So i feel like i've had so many kinds of.
Makeup on my face for it's been like 10.
Years yeah i've always loved makeup and.
I love color and i love playing and i.
Love ironically a lot of my influences.
Are actually men that use makeup just.
Totally like incorrectly mm-hmm but i'm.
Really inspired by people that utilize.
What they want how they want just so.
Many different ways to use makeup that.
Doesn't have to be about looking like.
This perfect super femicide all approved.
Thing it's more about expressing what i.
Like and like what color i feel today i.
Just use a little bit of cannibal which.
Is the bright red shade which by the way.
Is so beautiful i love about that and.
Then i'm now gonna grab a little bit of.
A buggy feet on a fluffy brush and i'm.
Squinted buff out to the edges how did.
You choose the different shades for the.
Palate so i wanted to think about what i.
Wear.
Yeah well my friends we're all different.
Skin tones like just what everybody.
Likes right then i'm also looking for.
This chartreuse color which is my.
Favorite color in the entire world.
Dinosaur which i have all of my lower.
Lash line right now and i love that and.
I've just never been able to find like.
The perfect chartreuse i'm like obsessed.
With that color okay and then also like.
I have to have a glitter i remember a.
Few months ago i was playing minecraft i.
Was live streaming on twitch and the ego.
Popped up was like collaboration with.
Kasia and i literally screamed and i i.
Was live and i was like what is going on.
What happened i was like oh i just got a.
Really cool video opportunity so if.
Anybody was watching this you guys will.
Know now was the first thing that i said.
Was if she doesn't have a glitter i'm.
Not doing this they're lovely you have.
Multiple shades of glitter and jammers.
And then some matte just but yeah i.
Wanted to give people a variety so i.
Wanted to have it really colorful but.
Also have like the basics like a black.
You can always just slap on a smoky eye.
And sleep in it and wake up and just.
Kind of look cool i mean some days or.
Just like really hungover a little bit.
Of honey right on to the lid.
Oh that's really really perfect.
Like on my leg cupid's bow oh we should.
Try that on the cheekbone it's gonna cut.
The edge okay i want to test out this.
Whole little water theory yeah so what.
You do is divot just lightly okay and.
Then which color are you going for it.
Knocks over okay so get a little wet.
Make it kind of pasty great nick it's a.
Little darker one more tense i'm gonna.
Use this to lie your upper lash line and.
Create almost a wing but definitely okay.
So i'm gonna grab my little pencil brush.
And that sound below love this color.
Literally it's so something i love the.
Shape in as well i'm gonna give this a.
Quick little spritz as well of some.
Setting spray it's really intensify okay.
I'm going to yes thank you.
Music.
You like a lot on your lower lash line.
Like yeah i do i feel like it smells a.
Little bit of pageantry and below just.
To kind of blend it out a little bit so.
It like has something to kind of anchor.
Into the lower lash abundant than just.
Being a shimmering blue what is that.
Well this is a glitter oh my god that's.
Oh really okay we're gonna put this.
Below your eye just to really make it.
Fine you know your entire makeup line is.
Beginning cruelty for it yeah and you.
