Obviously love coeternal my rat's nest.
Of a man bun is now chopped off.
Thank the lord and heaven above god.
Bless major living legend jen atkin if.
You guys don't know she actually sells.
The kardashians and a ton of other.
Amazing celebrities but she doesn't do.
Boycott that often and her eye we're.
Talking really girl i need to get this.
Off my head i'm so tired of looking ugly.
Every day where's my baseball hat and my.
Messy-ass hair like what can we do and.
She was like sister james i got you.
So i went into the salon and this is.
What came out of it honestly i'm so.
Happy with it i hope you guys love that.
Too.
There will not be a baseball hat for a.
Little bit of time now so hopefully we.
Can get used to the new look and yeah.
Moving right along for today's video.
We're gonna be doing a first impressions.
Chitchat get ready to me i'm actually.
Super pumped for this because do you.
Guys know that i really don't change out.
My makeup routine that often to toys the.
Make up for ever ultra hd foundation.
Stick shape cube concealer laura mercier.
And benefit brow stop shave tape on the.
Brows and some type of morphe i shadow.
Palette some type of highlighter and.
Then a nude lip like you guys feel me at.
This point although i do love tori.
Getting some creative looks it's been a.
Hot minute since i've tried some brand.
New products all that being said i've.
Been saving up some pr packages from the.
Last few weeks some of my favorite.
Companies and i have a ton of products.
That i cannot wait to show you guys so.
Let's get started.
As always i'm just probably my face.
Using my benefit porefessional primer.
You guys know this is like my.
Ride-or-die primer and i probably will.
Honestly never switched up unless i find.
Something better skin is always been.
Something that it's been like a major.
Problem area for me in my life i used to.
Have really bad acne but lily my skin.
Has been treating me so what's so well.
And i am so frickin happy about it so.
Yeah purple it is i actually just got a.
Facial a few days ago for the first time.
When they did like the extractions where.
They said they're like pop everything.
Out of your nose i was laughing so hard.
Because the only thought right through.
Her head was.
You could probably pop all the.
Blackheads on my nose and literally.
Repackage all the gunk into a benefit.
Porefessional primer because that's all.
I ever felt my frickin nose purple and a.
Sheet on these might make up for ever.
Ultra hd sick and the shade of y at 325.
Once again this is one of those products.
That is my holy grail and will not.
Change and there was no what foundations.
Than any of the packages that i receive.
So can't switch anything up i'm so.
Freaking excited because you know all.
The sisters are going with makeup.
Forever tight to a kailani concert here.
In los angeles and i absolutely love her.
And her music i think she's so talented.
And just so like cool in general we.
Actually just got a tux earlier thinking.
We're gonna get to hang out with her.
Before the show something which is.
Literally is so dope so i am getting.
Ready for that right now i'm praying.
That all these products that i'm trying.
On today we're gonna favor because this.
Is gonna be the look that i'm wearing.
Tonight y'all know that that self he's.
Gonna be iconic so hopefully we can pull.
This off all right so i just went ahead.
And applied my shape tape concealer in.
The shade light and then blended it out.
As usual is my damn beauty blender and.
Now the next step is ways to set my face.
So for today i am using a new setting.
Powder and this is the rcm a no color.
Powder you may have seen this before.
Because i know a lot of people talk.
About and abused it if you've used it i.
Apologize this is not your first.
Impressions as my first impressions and.
I have never tried this before so i'm.
Gonna use it today you guys know that.
Setting powder is a little bit of a.
Touchy subject for me so i'm actually.
Super nervous to try a new one but i've.
Heard a lot of good reviews so let's go.
Ahead and give it a try so first light.
Is going on really really nicely it.
Definitely is like pretty finely milled.
So that's good because we don't get.
Those like ugly like splotches that.
Sometimes it catches on to the.
Foundation but i'm gonna keep putting it.
On and see when i think up deep and it's.
Definitely a really good job of like.
Mattifying and setting everything in.
Place as you can see my nose definitely.
Looks locked right and then which is.
Great because lord knows that my nose.
Loves to slip and slide around i'm also.
Gonna place a little bit of this right.
In the center of my forehead just to set.
That area in place and make sure i don't.
Get any creases because i do tend to.
Crease up there a lot and then lightly.
Just a but some excess powder on that.
Way face lately i actually have not been.
Setting my entire face i've been going.
For more of the like a dewy skin a.
Foundation.
I've honestly been loving it here loss.
And doesn't this literally it's so.
Freakin hot i've had my ac blasting all.
Morning and all night last night and.
It's still it's like a million degrees.
In here which is very very rude and.
Homophobic because i'm about to melt but.
We're gonna make it work i'm gonna suck.
It up but yeah so i haven't been setting.
My entire face and i've been living for.
The dewy look but that depends on your.
Skin type and how it you like wearing.
Your makeup if you want to set your.
Makeup and if you're someone who.
Definitely gets oily definitely a pack.
On the powder girl you do you so now.
That my face is all set and locked right.
And please the next person precious i.
Wanna pull is actually a brush set james.
Charles not using morphe brushes relax.
Do you know that the jacqueline.
Hill morbid club is coming in about five.
Seconds hold up today i want to show you.
Guys the club that i have a super duper.
Excited about and it was actually when.
My best friends and true sisters in the.
Entire world.
Hey zeus and his club with the makeup.
Shock i am so beyond excited to this.
That i have been with him since the.
Entire beginning of this even being.
Planned in the first place so i'm so.
Excited to have it right here in front.
Of me and i definitely won't be using.
These brushes on my face today on the.
Back of the palaces i have created this.
Brush out of my personal favorite.
Brushes from the makeup shock to create.
A full face for the everyday glam a.
Combination of natural and synthetic.
Brushes i hope you enjoyed this as much.
As i do.
Xoxo hey zeus gomez i am so freaking.
Proud of them.
This set comes nine brushes and there.
Are angled brushes i brushes compact.
Brushes and then face brushes as well so.
Definitely a full on set i know retails.
For $75 that the makeup shock which is.
Definitely a little pricey for a brush.
That but y'all know me of course every.
Staudte that i did get a coupon code so.
You guys can now use code chance or.
Twenty percent or purchase at the makeup.
Shock that brings the price of this down.
To rome $60 and divided by nine that's.
Just over six dollars per brush so.
Definitely not too bad of a deal.
So shut off leather we grab the t 27.
Brush from the brush set and then dip.
Into my kat von d shade and light.
Palette into this middle shade and i'm.
Going to contour and chisel out my face.
Oh my god the bristles on these are so.
Soft.
Wow legend went off we got a contour out.
That jaw light as well and snatch her.
Right up and we definitely are not gonna.
Miss out on this for yet contour lord.
And nose and now that i don't have a.
Baseball hat to cover half of this.
Region we're gonna need to use that.
Contour to turn this five head back into.
Around a.
Three head i'm then gonna grab the t-84.
Brush in that same shade from the shade.
And light palette and i'm going to.
Contour out my nose oh my god that.
Actually lay down the color so nicely my.
Luck see 182 brush is shaking i'm gonna.
Actually really like this brush yes t 94.
You better work before we move onto.
Baking i'm gonna quickly grab my tea 17.
Also from the brush set and dip into a.
Mac peaches blush and just put a light.
Wash of color on at the cheekbones okay.
Maybe that wasn't exactly the best brush.
For a light to wash the color but it'll.
Do alright so i'm gonna grab my beauty.
Blender and dip right back into that rca.
And no color powder and i'm going to be.
My face so i'm gonna my nose contour as.
Always even though the powder is trims.
Looser i'm really hoping that because.
It's white it's still a bright enough.
Everything a little bit and if it does.
Were about to look so snatch in a few.
Minutes and i was super excited to see.
How this rubs off alright so while i was.
In the oven baking ideas quickly went.
Ahead into my brows off-camera save some.
Time same exact process as always no new.
Products or first impressions so now.
That it's been a long really time we're.
Gonna go ahead and we're going to wipe.
This bake off and see how this powder.
Did okay so i was definitely right the.
Thought that it is white definitely did.
Leave a little bit of a highlighted look.
But i really really like that that's.
Exactly what i look for in a setting.
Powder i really like when i bake my face.
And it like really brings back those.
Highlights so i need help there very.
Ready to find contour highlight like.
Very very full focus 360 full glam.
Snatch that was stupid i apologize so.
You know what i mean looking up close my.
Skin definitely does a little bit more.
Porous than usual especially in like the.
T-zone area right up in here that's.
Where ports are usually the worst but it.
Definitely doesn't look as good as it.
Normally does today i'm not sure if.
That's the powder or my skin in general.
Not having a good skin day but i.
Definitely want to keep using this.
Powder because they like how it looks so.
Far and i will keep you guys posted at.
For sure alright so i already went ahead.
And prime my eyelids using my shape tape.
Concealer and then some more rc made no.
Color powder as usual and now we're.
Going to move on to the eyes and this is.
What i was so so so excited for and that.
Is the jacqueline bo collaboration with.
Morphe nothing this was actually.
Released i can actually smell a little.
Bit of a secret for you bodies but a.
Long long long time ago jacqueline.
Actually showed me the mock-up for this.
Palette on facetime.
She showed me like one of the first.
Trial region.
Honestly it has changed so much since.
Then but it is just so beyond beautiful.
Joplin if you are watching us i freaking.
Love you so much.
I don't know if any of you guys know.
This because the only tour of the story.
Like once or twice but jonathan hills.
Actually like the reason i started doing.
Makeup in the first place she's holding.
My inspiration i would stay up all night.
Watching her youtube videos i just think.
She's just like the most boss ass.
Ever i love her and i respect her so.
Much and obviously you guys know i love.
Morphe as well so this club was just.
Made in heaven and if you know.
Jacqueline you know that this is.
Literally her in a frickin a palette.
Version so this palette comes 235 custom.
Formulated shades they are not the.
Everyday morphe formula and i have not.
Washed them yet but i've seen other.
People i know that these are gonna be.
Good but i'm gonna save my opinions.
Until i actually put them on my face.
That being said this palette retails for.
$35 so it is a little bit steeper than.
Morphine as usual $22 a palette but it's.
Living 35 amazing shades for $35 you.
Really really it cannot be that this.
Palette won't just in a few days so you.
Definitely are gonna want to get your.
Hands on it while you can and as always.
You can use coach a store 10% off your.
Purchase but this is jacqueline's.
Palette so if you wanna double support.
Her.
Please use code a jack attack as well.
That has jacqueline's code i'll put it.
Right down here on the screen go show.
Her some love this palette is literally.
Everything and i'm so pumped to put it.
On my face right now i'm first gonna.
Start by grabbing the shade creamsicle.
On my makeup shot t70 brush and i'm just.
Going to buff this right into the crease.
Oh my god that's been dead okay jonathan.
I see use the sir.
I'm next thing to grab the shade hunt on.
My makeup shock at44 brush and i'm going.
To buff this right into the crease.
Because i'm going to be transitioning.
From like yellow to orange to a red oh.
My god these colors are literally.
Blending it so beautifully i'm kind of.
Stuck to the coil right now i'm mexican.
Mit 63 brush and dip into the shade at.
Jack's and i'm going to put this right.
In that crease for a little pop of red.
Oh yeah then we can knock it over how.
Pigmented these shadows are that was.
Living with one dip into the pan.
We got ya like hi okay i'm gonna dip.
Back into hunt's with that t-44a brush.
And just buff over those edges i was not.
Anticipating that much pigmentation so.
Now we need to blend her out or else.
This is gonna get real messy real fast.
Once all those three colors are on there.
As well i'm gonna dip back into.
Creamsicle and just go over those edges.
Make sure they are super blended out and.
Their transitions are all smooth i.
Really want to do a pop of blue on the.
Eye so with that same exact e63 brush.
I'm actually gonna dip into the shade of.
Royalty which is a metallic purple shade.
In this palette but i'm gonna use this.
As kind of a transition shade between.
The metallic blue that's gonna go on the.
Lid and the cranberry color that i just.
Might in the crease and once it's all on.
There i'm gonna go back into the same.
Brush in the shade jack's which is the.
Red shade and just bring back the.
Cranberry color i'm gonna grab my t79.
Brush and didn't do the shade at work.
Which is this metallic blue shade i am.
So excited for this and i'm gonna pop.
Her right onto the lid oh my god my.
Brush libya is not even wet either miss.
Hill suddenly my wig just got ripped off.
And flew all the way from los angels to.
Wherever you are in florida these are so.
Good i know everybody's gonna say i'm.
Sucking up tomorrow because i always do.
But honestly these shadows are like so.
Good i genuinely would not expect.
Anything less than perfect for.
Jacqueline and so far that is exactly.
What i'm seeing i'm gonna go back in.
With torque you know what i'm gonna.
Surprise my brushes in the all-nighter.
And i'm just gonna lay this on top again.
And see how like actual metallic we can.
Get it oh my god these are literally.
Beautiful okay i think i want to show.
This into a little bit of a halo eye.
Situation so i'm gonna grab the same.
Exact brush and dip into the slightest.
Bit of a pool party.
Once again gonna spritz that brush that.
I'm just gonna layer that right on the.
Center of the lid and see how that looks.
I'm a little bit love of how this.
Looks so far so i guess we're going to.
Move on to the lower lash line now so.
I'm gonna start off using the exact same.
Shade of torque on the same t79 brush.
And i'm going to above this in two and.
Then going to grab a double pool party.
And papa in the center.
Once again i never got that t44 brush.
One last time and dip into jax and i'm.
Just going to blend all those editors.
And connect it back up to the upper lash.
Line to highlight the inner corners i'm.
Gonna go to my sigma e30 brush and dip.
Into the shade beam which is this.
Beautiful bright house highlighting.
Shade and i'm going to pop that right in.
There oh wow before i move on to the.
Lashes i describe my mac reflex teal.
Because i want the center of the lid to.
Really really really pop so i'm just.
Gonna grab my tee at 79 brush one last.
Time.
Dip into just the slightest little bit.
Of it and i'm going to stretch my brush.
Then i'm just going to hop her on there.
Everything that is there gosh that'll.
All complete for laughs today i'm gonna.
Pop on the makeup shock lashes in the.
Style dubai i'm having a really good.
Makeup day today and i'm honestly it.
Really and then of course i'm gonna use.
My roller lash mascara just to blend.
Together the fake lashes with the real.
Ones all right sisters that is when i.
All complete i'm honestly hoping this.
Look so much so far it is definitely a.
Good makeup day so it's sister james is.
Happy i'm gonna go ahead and do the.
Other one off-camera quickly and i'll be.
Right back to finish off the rest of the.
Face.
Alright guys i am back with both eyes.
All complete i wiped off the crusty.
Foundation on my lips brush my teeth to.
Get ready to go for tonight's event and.
Now let's move on with the glow for.
Highlighter said i were using the wet n.
Wild mega glow highlighting powder i am.
So freaking excited because i've heard.
So many great things about these but.
They're literally still don't everywhere.
I've looked for them so many times that.
My different drugstores you guys know.
Cried drugstore makeup girl a few weeks.
Ago i was talking about wanting to use.
These but they were nowhere to be found.
So i finally got this one today i.
Actually has a matter of fact wet and.
Wild just let me a huge pr package with.
A ton of their products so definitely.
Give this video a big thumbs up down.
Below if you want me to do a full face.
Using only well products because i would.
Definitely be down definitely not as.
Blinding as i was expecting but not bad.
To formula that's like rubbing my brush.
And it feels extremely soft which is.
Good because that means that the texture.
Of your natural face won't show as much.
Because i know highly a lot of times.
Accentuate texture especially for me.
Because they have a lot of pimples in my.
Highlight region for some annoying ass.
Reason but the form of this feels really.
Really good this highlighter is.
Definitely a really really pretty and i.
Know this is drugstore price i think.
This is like $6 so honestly for $6 it's.
Really really not bad i'm just being.
Dramatic here but definitely not as a.
Blonde.
As i was expecting it to be i'm probably.
Gonna end up lying this with like my.
Makeup forever 13 pigment or my anasazi.
So hollywood just to be like blinding.
People left and right but definitely so.
Beautiful for the price i said this how.
That is beautiful and i did not lie and.
It's definitely beautiful on the.
Cheekbones but for the nose contour haha.
For some reason even though this valley.
Is literally super super light it is.
Apparently too dark for my skin tone.
Because when i'm not hitting the light.
Like right there you can see it's not.
Reflecting light so it looks a little.
Bit darker than my nose contour which.
Completely ruins the effect which is so.
Frustrating so i'm just gonna layer over.
Top the makeup upper 13 right on that.
Area because lord knows that that is.
That blinding and will hopefully fix.
This oh great that literally just made.
It 20 times worse i think that's.
Probably a message from somebody up.
Above saying james stop trying to make.
Your nose look 20 time sorrow that.
Actually is because sister you're not.
Fooling anybody are this is the last.
Step of this makeup show us obviously.
Going to beat the liquid you doodahs and.
For this i do have a first impressions a.
New product and that is the brain news.
Away high pigment lip gloss is i love.
Joy aylor highlighters are so bomb and i.
Love their lip toppers as well so i was.
So excited to see their brand-new.
Glosses these are all that will right up.
In here i'm going to lean back because.
There are a whole lot of them for sure.
For this look i'm gonna pop on the shade.
At pch alright so as the base i.
Discipline the colour-pop ultra satin.
Lip in the shade aquarius just to give.
The gloss something to like stick to and.
Layer over top up and now i'm gonna.
Reapply to show you dat pch i love how.
This looks oh my god.
Freshen the giggles i think overtown.
Familiar the g way a skinny dip lip.
Topper just for some extra glow some.
Glam some shine why not lastly to finish.
Off the stick i'm just going to drench.
My face using the urban decay all.
Nighter setting spray.
Alright guys and this is the completed a.
Full face using all first impressions.
Glam i am honestly so alive for this.
Look i love it so freakin much let's go.
Back interview all the products that we.
Tried today the first time being the are.
Cma no color powder this definitely did.
A really good job of baking the face and.
Lightening it up i loved the effect that.
It gave but it definitely did make my.
Pores and texture look not the best and.
It's never looked.
Usually the alarm rca powder doesn't.
Really get up absolutely everything out.
So i definitely going to give this.
Another shot and see if it's just the.
Powder or if it is just my skin don't.
Know it looks pretty but i've seen it.
Look better so i'm quite sure to at.
Least all in the fence with this one.
But did a decent job for today that's.
What the makeup stock brushes they're.
Definitely a big hit for me you guys.
Know that i'm very very loyal to morphe.
And the brushes don't absolutely love.
Them but i have to support my best.
Friend in the entire world.
Hayes's i am so freaking proud of you.
And you guys need to go check out this.
Brush set as soon as it launches and.
Remember co james gets you 20% off.
Actually the next item on the list you.
Already know how i feel about miss.
Over here this pillow is literally.
Everything i am just so beyond check out.
The quality and how they blended and.
Just the pigmentation in general this.
Palette is a hundred percent a win as i.
Said before i am so beyond proud of.
Sister jacqueline she is the person who.
Single-handedly got me into the beauty.
Industry i've always looked up to her.
And now it is literally so freakin crazy.
And cool to me that i'm able to call her.
One of my best friends so proud of you.

A double support sister chocolate use.
Coat a jacket a cat your check out as.
Well next up on the list was the wet n.
Wild highlighting powder and i wanted to.
Love this so so so so bad but i think.
This is gonna be my one fail of this.
Video it looks so beautiful on the.
Cheeks i'm like the brow bone and the.
Upper forehead region but on the nose.
Contour it is really not doing it.
Justice it definitely is a little bit.
Too dark for a skin which is so strange.
Because this is already a super super.
Light highlighter but it's giving us.
That great pass when the light isn't.
Hitting it so this is gonna be a fail.
For me but like i said before definitely.
Give this video a big thumbs up if you.
Want to see a full face using all wet.
And wild products because i do have a.
Full collection now that i would love to.
Try out for you guys and last but.
Certainly not least was the jus a new.
Ultra penguin lip glosses and these are.
So bob i used to shade pch on my look.
Today at once again layer over that.
Color pop gloss but i absolutely love.
How it looks the formula is really.
Really nice i know a lot of glosses.
Oftentimes feel really really tacky or.
Sticky when i go like this my lip lick.
Sticks together but this wears.
Beautifully it's lightweight it's simple.
