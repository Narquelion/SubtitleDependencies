Crazy cause it's just like so many new.
People all at the same time and i'm just.
Really excited to get started on this.
Brand-new journey so i know with that.
I'm gonna totally explain the white skin.
I feel like that was kind of like way.
Too on-trend i want this to be more.
Inspired by not as literal as mario says.
So we're gonna do the colors instead of.
The black and white we're gonna do what.
Color you would put there looks like a.
Pink area for like blood like white fry.
Light yeah oh my god i leave out that.
Idea okay cool and then we'll just leave.
The skin bare so just be like snatch.
Dope i'm never gonna do a half face yes.
Her face is good yep okay so what has.
Been like the biggest changes so far.
Since you announced it was made.
Obviously my engagement yeah i feel like.
I blew up overnight and is super it's.
Like very in say influence or ass and i.
Think just like overall where i want to.
Go in the industry i think it's.
Definitely changed this is this has been.
A super huge positive impact really yeah.
Anything new with like comments videos.
Like what'swhat's this situation because.
I know earlier you're saying like you.
Feel like a lot of pressure now yeah now.
I feel this unbelievable pressure to be.
Posting like super good juicy content so.
I'm getting like a taste of what i feel.
Like you might be going through on a.
Daily basis like yeah so definitely.
Making sure that i mean remaining.
Interesting and open yeah is on the.
Porphyrin that pressure and like that.
Drive to continue posting it's going to.
Be what keeps you growing in as folks.
Kept all the other contestants growing.
As well like for example like kailyn as.
Well healings at like almost 300,000.
Followers by the time the mercury is in.
Can i have a second and i think like.
She's written even over a million views.
Such good examples of like what the show.
Can do beyond you winning yeah you know.
What i mean and how real is it that like.
Sometimes good that don't win right are.
Also just as successful if not more you.
Know what i mean so i think next we.
Should do the contour okay go for it.
Okay i want to know from you when we.
Finish talking first because i feel like.
It's gonna like what were your.
Expectations going into the show.
Because obviously i've never done a.
Reality competition show before burn and.
Like what was the experience like for.
You.
Honestly like i didn't have many.
Expectations but what i thought it was.
Gonna be like was like a big like airbnb.
And i thought you were gonna put all the.
Contestants in like a house.
Kind of like whole other side yeah so.
That's what i thought was gonna be i.
Thought it was gonna be more like blog.
Style just like more laid-back i when i.
Got into the set it was like a.
Full-blown production and like i was.
Like whoa i was like did not expect that.
How was your cruise on the show and you.
Can do this all your working as well be.
Watching well keep my mouth shut so you.
Can speak the experience in the show was.
Super intense.
Obviously like i've never done a.
Competition show before you gave us no.
Time to adjust what he was like.
Immediately like next day my competition.
So i think for me it was just really.
Intense but what i will say is i learned.
New things about myself and how i work.
Under pressure yeah okay wait are.
Contour oh is the night cont no you know.
Okay i want to know from you what do you.
Think was the hardest challenge on the.
Show and what was your favorite moment.
From the show.
Okay hardest challenge ooh let's see the.
Hardest challenge i think was probably.
The first one really cuz it was the.
First one yeah that was like the hardest.
One it was like really gonna set the.
Tone for what you were looking for any.
We were going to be able to like you.
Know i was actually gonna hear you.
Critique me yeah first time so i think.
It was gonna set the tone for like how i.
Was gonna compete it was such a cool i.
Mean so many other artists i mean like.
Abe reles luck was incredible for that.
As well really cool but i feel like.
Yours was not only artistic but i also.
Connected like i told me a little bit.
About you and how you do percent.
Yourself as an artisan person and that's.
What it was about so blush should be.
Here or like on top of it like more.
Further back here is over that was your.
Favorite moment of the show and you can.
Do this while you're working winning now.
My favorite moment outside of that it.
Was in the finale and it was when kailen.
Like basically cornered me and she like.
This close to my face that she was like.
I'm in tonight.
Love you so much and i was like you're.
Gonna make me cry please stop one thing.
That i want to know that we talked a.
Little bit about on the show but didn't.
Get too far into yet was your son i'm.
Scared that you are a mom yeah this is.
So cool how did your son react to.
Winning personal um he could care less.
No he's excited more so about like the.
Status and what this means for like his.
Friends and like their birthday.
Shoutouts.
Oh my god elessar ready dude yes of.
Course but mostly he's just proud of me.
And i think that my son doesn't he won't.
Ever admit this probably but i think.
That he does get a little bit inspired.
About me just having a really unorthodox.
Lifestyle yeah you know i'm not your.
Typical mom i'm the cool mom.
So i really want to learn more about.
Like just your teen mom dirty i thought.
Do they like talking about that on.
Your channel 100% okay yeah i'm ready.
For that i am totally i'm down to.
Dedicate a lot of time actually to.
Talking about it cuz i think that.
There's so many moms that get.
Discouraged from this industry because i.
Don't think they can or they're not you.
Know i don't know there's like moms get.
Discouraged about so much like your mom.
Had some issues or she like you know put.
Some things on the back burner for you.
Guys so i think moms do that as an.
Instinct right not me baby we can have.
It all that's all so that you are.
Excited like the hot to tell him that i.
Said hello yes oh my god i know it's.
Like whiteout whoa god mr. peanut really.
Knows how to make a good product.
Oh okay so do me a favor and just look.
Down okay we look at me again sorry okay.
With them okay actually i have a fun.
Question especially since you are not.
Great at showing your boobs.
What was your first impression of both.
The contestants and the judges oh that's.
A good one okay so actually i was in the.
Car with caitlin first which is so funny.
Oh were you yeah so we couldn't talk to.
Each other on the show but caitlin can't.
Help it she's very like so much of a.
Person she couldn't talk to me but she.
Was talking to the talent manager and so.
My first impression of caitlin was she.
Talks when she's nervous yeah and then.
When i first saw the other contestants.
Was like on set.
So my first impression of indigo was oh.
My god he looks like a babbage like he.
Is definitely going like i kind of.
Targeted him as like my biggest threat.
Immediately i was he has a presence.
About him in the real life definitely.
One of the artists that i was looking.
Forward most to seeing i think he's.
Gonna take everything that happened with.
The show and run with that oh yes i hope.
He does he's the perfect example of like.
You don't need to win to have success.
For sure but he i kind of sized him up.
Because he just has this aura about him.
Very bad    vibe so i was kind of.
Like okay and then benny.
I've been protective and very maternal.
Over benny since the moment i saw him he.
Was very quiet and kind of meek and.
Although he has a very big boisterous.
Personality his energy is very still an.
Eighteen year old so i felt really.
Maternal over him.
Yeah i didn't talk much with gabriel.
Until actually after indigo went home.
That's when gabriel really started to.
Show his personality to us he was really.
Quiet i was surprised he's very shy so i.
Actually mean gabriel what you don't see.
Is that we had really long conversations.
About like zodiacs and like crystals and.
Like the earth and the planet cuz i'm.
Into that kind of stuff too like no one.
Would ever know that but so my.
Impressions of gabriel was that he was.
Really quiet and then after i got to.
Know him he was just actually a really.
Deeply caring person yeah my first.
Impression of brittany was she had the.
Cutest style so brittany had on like a.
Really cute little cropped like black.
Windbreaker and he's like cute ripped-up.
High-waisted jeans so i actually looked.
At brittany and i was like oh my god.
She's so cute which is like she's so.
Pretty that was my first impression brt.
Mm-hmm my first impression of you was.
That oh yeah please tell me my first.
Impression of james was like this isn't.
A youtube channel like why is he talking.
In real life like it just didn't.
Register to me and he looked like he was.
Still in his channel but in real life so.
Like very bright shiny super sparkly.
That's what i like most sparkly in.
Person oh my god okay so concealer i.
Don't know if it's not fit james i'll.
Show you to bake.
Yeah right right to bake in this region.
Perfect.
Like the tick box where are you getting.
Your hair kind of the members.
Bro if you don't stop looking at me i.
Swear i'm cutting all your hair off.
How was it when you got to watch the.
Episode to see the judgment deliberation.
Like that you weren't there for you guys.
Said so much to us like to our faces i.
Know so and nothing like shocked me.
About it i think where i was like oh is.
That in those moments we just had no.
Idea of what you guys were saying yeah.
Like we just had no idea how you guys.
Were coming up with the decision right.
So the dance were like our long.
Deliberation yeah let's make sure we.
Made the right choice i guess i didn't.
Realize how much you guys you know put.
Into the making the decision so even.
More privilege okay glad to know it.
Wasn't like a crazy shady no no no it.
Was good it was all right so ashley just.
Apply to do lips to the lips and then.
Also added the other eye on camera so.
Even though we're gonna take the photo.
Half way just in case.
A lot of tvs there are no angles you.
Know we're gonna pop on at the lashes.
And i have one final question for you.
That i think will be a great way to end.

Criticism yeah and i want to be open and.
More connected with you guys so i'm.
Definitely to be opening up more being a.
Lot more vulnerable i also want to.
