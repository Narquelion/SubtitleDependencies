My time but in a very very good way if.
You missed it i am officially the first.
Male covergirl and there will be a video.
On that with all your questions and all.
The details and behind the scenes.
Footage coming soon so make sure you.
Definitely stay tuned now that.
Everything is kind of calmed down at.
Least a little bit and i am a back home.
I finally have some time to sit down and.
Film for you guys and get back into the.
Halloween groove today i decided to film.
This super drag super glam a playboy.
Bunny inspired look i absolutely love.
How this turned out i posted it on my.
Instigator day and everybody was.
Commenting asked me to film it so of.
Course i had to sit down and teach you.
Guys how to do this look full credit and.
Inspiration for this look goes to jubu.
Or instagram will be right here she is.
So talented and she did this first so.
This is inspired by her also this video.
Is a collaboration with one of my best.
Friends in the entire world.
Tina helada or tutorials by tina she's a.
15 year old makeup artist and she is.
Beyond talented so we decided to team up.
And do two different styles so tina.
Decided to do a more toned town glam and.
Definitely easier version of this look.
If you want to see how she created hers.
Make sure you click right here tell her.
Jane sent you she is amazing as for my.
Look cover we always got to be extra 8.
Up on this channel you guys know that i.
Never do anything toned down so this is.
The look i came up with this dry glam.
Inspired a playboy bunny and if you want.
To see how i created it make sure you.
Keep on watching.
Hi guys to begin this tutorial today i'm.
Gonna start off by covering my brows now.
This technique is definitely not the.
Easiest thing in the world so if you.
Argan do this for halloween please make.
Sure you practice beforehand it can be.
Very very tricky i'm just using a.
Regular glue stick and a brushing all.
The glue into my brow hairs and then.
Combing every hair up with a spoolie on.
The end of a brow brush to really make.
Sure they are flat to my face and every.
Hair is separated and going upwards then.
I'm just going to take a damp towel and.
Kind of go over the edges of the glue to.
Blend them into my skin sometimes it can.
Be a pretty textured and lumpy so like i.
Said we really want to make sure these.
Are flat to create a new layer of skin.
Then i'm just going to do the same thing.
On the.
Bro and once that is coated in dry i'm.
Just gonna continue to lay our glue and.
Then finding it letting it dry it.
Between three or four times depending on.
How thick your actual brows are until.
You get the desired coverage to where.
You feel they are good then i'm going to.
Set my brow hairs in place using kody.
Airspun this is my favorite setting.
Powder and just a regular powder puff to.
Really press that powder in there once.
Again to make sure they are very very.
Flat and not textured then i'm using my.
Morphe 48 brush to brush away the excess.
Hairs.
Now to begin covering the brows i'm.
Going to use my mac painterly paint-pot.
This paint pot is super super pigmented.
I'm just brushing it on with the morphe.
R32 brush to really pack that color on.
There i love this because it really.
Covers the texture and the color of the.
Brows which can be very very hard if you.
Have huge ass caterpillar brows like i.
Do so i would definitely recommend this.
Step then i'm gonna prime my face using.
A benefit professional you guys know i.
Love this primer this entire tutorial is.
Gonna be very very out of order i.
Apologize this is just kind of the way i.
Did things and it worked out pretty well.
So follow along if you choose or just do.
Whatever you want and then using that.
Same paint pot actually to start to.
Paint my nose now this technique was.
Recommended to me by a follower and you.
Guys always know that i complain about.
Foundations something off my nose so.
This technique has really saved the lane.
Of my nose contour and really helps.
Everything to stay in place all day long.
It doesn't wear out then i'm just using.
A damp beauty blender to kind of blend.
Over the edges of the nose and the.
Eyebrow cover i'm then just gonna start.
My regular foundation routine as always.
Is my makeup over ultra hd foundation.
Stick i'm just gonna put this all over.
My face including my brows and my nose.
We really want to make sure there is.
Even coverage and no discoloration and.
Then i'm just gonna blend that in very.
Very carefully using my morphe 439.
Foundation brush this is one of my.
Favorite foundation brushes ever it is.
So great and you can use code james for.
10% off all morphe brushes and products.
You guys know i absolutely love them and.
Stand behind them 100% so you should.
Definitely check them out if you have.
Not already and then i'm just going into.
My too faced born this way concealer to.
Put it in the high points on my face and.
Then blending that out with the damp.
Beauty blender to really get everything.
It's snatched then you look absolutely.
Horrifying and you get to make this face.
In the mirror and at this point you are.
Ready to set your face once again i'm.
Using a kody era spot and a powder puff.
Just to pack it on i'm starting off in.
The kind of baked areas like the.
Eyebrows and then on.
The eyes and then i'm just going in and.
Just kind of slopping this everywhere to.
Really make sure i am a full face matte.
And definitely not oily or wet anywhere.
To begin sketching out the eye of the.
Bunny i'm using my makeup forever flash.
Palette the white shade obviously and my.
Morphe m15 a brush to begin kind of.
Drawing it in place where i want it i'm.
Going to draw a line upwards problem at.
The corner of my eye and then from the.
Inner corner of my nose and then kind of.
Connect it sort of similar to the way we.
Draw a cut crease just a lot bigger and.
More draggy if that makes any sense i'm.
Really making sure to pack a lot of.
Product on there because we want this.
White to be super opaque obviously we.
Can go over and clean it up later on in.
The future and then i'm gonna take the.
Anasazi liquid lipstick shades in pure.
Hollywood and blush mixing them together.
On an angled brush and sketching that.
Right over the white line we just drew.
This is gonna be kind of the i guess.
Eyebrow of the bunny i don't really know.
What it is but it looks cute so we.
Decided to do it and it was in the.
Original book by jubu as i said before.
So i really really loved what she did.
And i wanted to recreate it as.
Accurately as possible i'm just.
Following the same exact shape as the.
White line that i created below while.
Making it a lot thicker and then a.
Tapering it off in the inner corner to.
Create that classic drag effect i'm not.
Gonna use my morphe amma 4-3-3 brush and.
The anasazi a single shadow and shade.
Babycakes and kind of said that liquid.
Lipstick in place i know it will dry but.
I really want to make sure this is super.
Super exactly there and where we needed.
To be and the nurse going back over with.
My m15 e as i said before from morphe.
And the same white shade to really make.
Sure those lines are opaque and very.
Very sharp and defined then to begin the.
Upper fur of the eye on once again using.
The same brush same shape same color.
From the flash palette and i'm just.
Going to follow that pink line exactly.
But i'm going to start sketching in some.
Fur this time i'm really making sure to.
Pack a lot of product on there this.
Product while they are great can be very.
Very wet so sometimes i find that it can.
Kind of drag the foundation along with.
It so really make sure you're putting a.
Lot of product on there so when you drag.
Out the fur you're not dragging out the.
Foundation with you and your fur remains.
White and super clean to set the fern.
Place i'm going to be using my ben nye.
Super wet face powder on a flat to find.
A russian just packing this right into.
The fur to make sure it is dry and super.
Opaque and white and then one of my.
And while mega liner in white it is a.
Super precise and thin liner which i.
Love and i'm just using this to draw in.
Some more furs and some tiny little.
Hairs this adds a lot more dimension to.
The look which previously was not.
Possible with the flash palette and then.
Using this tiny mac definer brush in my.
Kat von d shade and light palette i'm.
Using the shade all the way to the left.
To add in some shadowing to the cut.
Crease i'm just placing the shade.
Lightly underneath the white lines that.
We created earlier on the cut crease so.
Above the top line as well as the lower.
Line where the liner will be in a second.
This just creates some more dimension.
And kind of looks like it's like a mask.
That is popping off my face so i really.
Like how it looks for the liner today.
I'm gonna be using my kat von d trooper.
Liner this liner is super precise and.
Thin so i really do love it and i use it.
All the time which you guys know this.
Liner today was giving me a lot of.
Trouble i ended up redoing it and fixing.
It like five or ten times i don't know.
Why i'm not used to making liner this.
Big but it is a dried look so you got to.
Do what you got to do and then i'm going.
Back in once again with that mega liner.
From wet n wild and just sketching in.
Some more hairs over top of that pink.
Area i am however keeping these hairs a.
Little bit smaller than the previous.
Ones because we are gonna be adding some.
Glitter whoa who doesn't love glitter me.
Actually i really don't like glitter.
Because it's dirty and once you get.
Glitter in your life you literally never.
Can get glitter out but that's aside.
From the point under stating my makeup.
Forever mist and fix spray and then some.
Dollar-store glitter on my morphe i'm at.
242 brush and just packing this right.
Onto the pink area this adds a lot of.
Texture and dimension let's be real it's.
Pretty so you got included the glitter.
For a drag look to finish off this i am.
Then going back into the white from the.
Frost palette and filling in my.
Waterline as well as a lower lash line.
And then to shading once again with that.
Mock brush and the kat von d shade and.
Light palette add some final dimension.
And that completes one eye of this bunny.
Look going to go ahead and do the other.
One off cara then we can go ahead and.
Finish off the rest of the face for my.
Lashes today i'm puffing on a violet.
Boss lashes in the style i to hose you.
Guys know that i absolutely love these i.
Always wear these for my bigger look.
Such as like cut creases and drag books.
They're just perfect and mice and wispy.
For my lower lashes i'm popping on.
Janessa my rx lashes in the style of.
Thrive zero ones these are really just.
Gonna help to open my eye and kind of.
Further that whole drag effect and i'm.
Just popping those on or right below the.
White and the.
Line i'm then going in and starting to.
Contour my face is my morphe and 435.
Brush and my kat von d shade and light.
Palette i'm not going to help you.
Because we are going to be covering a.
Lot of the face with some more fur but i.
Am going to go pretty heavy on my jaw.
Line even though we are cute playboy.
Bunny we still want to be as snatched as.
How as always so i am a packing on the.
Bronzer and really making sure to chisel.
Out my jaw and then just gonna go in and.
Quickly bake my contour with my echo.
Tiara spot and a powder puff like i said.
Before not focusing too hard because we.
Are going to be covering a lot of it in.
Fur next i'm just going with my morphe m.
509 brush and a little bit of blush we.
Are gonna be using a pink highlighter.
Today from the anasazi at moonchild.
Palette so this just really helps blend.
Everything together and make sure that.
Glow is super pink and of course i'm.
Using a pink heart from abh moonchild.
Like i said then you start the facial.
Fur i'm just going into the white color.
From the makeup rubber flash palette.
Same thing as before and that definer.
Brush and just sketching it where i want.
The facial fur oh my god this voiceovers.
Literally such a mess it is so late at.
Night and i want to get this video oh.
And i feel like i'm barely speaking.
English anymore please bear with me once.
I have that in place i'm then just going.
Back in and starting to fill that in and.
Similar to it defer above the eyebrows.
I'm really making sure to put a lot of.
That product on there because sometimes.
It does move around so we want to make.
Sure we have white fur and not like.
Off-white skin color type fur then for.
The nose i'm just using the same mixture.
From before or those two liquid.
Lipsticks from abh they are blush and.
Pure hollywood and i'm just sketching.
Out the nose with a tiny angled definer.
Brush and i'm just going from nashville.
To nashville and then filling the tip of.
The nose in and then a similar to the.
Pink up crease i'm setting that with the.
Anasazi eye shadow and babycakes for my.
Lips today i'm going to be using anasazi.
Lucca lipstick in the shade a pure.
Hollywood it just to fill in my top lip.
I am over drawing a little bit but.
Making sure not to go overboard and then.
I'm going to set that in place in my.
Anasazi on babycakes single shadow as.
Well as setting the bottom lip would.
That been my super white powder to make.
Sure those two colors did not transfer.
Onto each other to finish off i'm going.
Into my morphe and to 50.0 liner brush.
And some black gel liner to draw a thin.
Line from the tip of the nose down to.
The cupid's bow and then finishing off.
