Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel first.
Of all if my voice sounds even more.
Annoying that it normally does please do.
Not comment about it i'm well aware i'm.
Currently getting over food poisoning.
From a very suspicious ravioli that i.
Ate a few years ago i've been a very bit.
Under the weather but we will never let.
That stop my youtube video production.
First today today i am very very excited.
Because we're doing a challenge is.
Probably a good friend jackie.
If he doesn't follow me for a long time.
You probably caught on to the fact that.
I definitely have my ride-or-die.
Products and i don't really such a my.
Makeup routine that often oh really.
Honestly at all it's been things that.
I've gotten caught out for quite a lot.
But i'm not a review channel i'm not.
Really a tutorial channel either and.
What i find thing that i love i.
Definitely like to stick to it because.
It works every once in a while though i.
Do find that brand new at.
Diamond-in-the-rough product that i like.
To just slip right that was quite a.
Sound effect but i like to just come in.
Late to just doesn't like to just slide.
That was a good wide that was the fun.
Side of that then i like to just slide.
Right into the makeup routine and it.
Quickly becomes one of my all-time holy.
Ground favorites to be used and hundreds.
Of videos have to the fact and for today.
I thought it'll be so much fun to put my.
Makeup knowledge to the test and ask how.
Well do i really know my own a beauty.
Routine for the show today i sent my.
Team on a very difficult mission they.
Set out with all my favorite products.
Right every day at beauty routine and.
They found it too very similar if not.
Little exact dupe products they.
Unpackaged all three and then repackaged.
All three into the exact same packaging.
So it looks like it's the same product.
But it's not and i'm going to have to.
Use my touch the application the smell.
And my eyesight obviously to try and.
Figure out if i actually know which out.
Of the three products is my actual.
Favorite that i use all the time i'm not.
Going into this i am pretty confident.
Considering i literally use these.
Products almost every single day i'm not.
Even sure i made it this far this a.
Beauty guru but who knows i could get.
Literally all of them wrong and i also.
May find some really amazing products.
That i would like to add to my routine.
So that further ado oh not without.
Further ado but one last thing to tell.
You guys.
We get started you probably noticed by.
Now but if not i'm wearing a brand new.
Assistants apparel hoodie.
It is in the color lavender which i am.
So pumped for you guys i am obsessed.
With this color it is literally so.
Beyond acute i've been getting so many.
Compliments on it all day long i am very.
Very pump to tell you guys about our.
Brand new pastel collection it is.
Launching this friday april 12th at 11.
A.m. pst on sisters - apparel calm we.
Have four new colors being at this.
Little lavender while we had a banana a.
Yellow one this is a much like more.
Muted version of our other yellow we.
Also have this like very very cute.
Orange creamsicle color.
I lost the finally not least we also.
Have this super cute teal color i know a.
Lot of you guys been asking for mint i.
Was convinced that this was mint and i.
Have since been informed that this is in.
Fact not mint its spearmint i guess if.
You want to call it we can definitely do.
A mint one in the future but regardless.
I think this color is still so beyond.
Cute if you guys want to check out any.
Of the four brand new hoodies make sure.
You set your loans for friday april 12.
At 11 a.m. at pst they are limited.
Edition so once they sell out they're.
Gone for a very very long time.
Don't miss out the pastel collection is.
So beyond cute and i cannot wait to see.
You guys all i also forgot to mention.
Clearly then we also have foam phases.
Launching as well and at both of.
Lavender and teal and matching your.
Honey colors i thought it'd be so much.
Fun to start releasing a phone cases.
Every time we have a new colored hoodies.
Launching it just so you guys can kind.
Of collect them and start matching kind.
Of fun kind of funky kind of fresh as.
Always they're available in a bunch of.
Different iphone models they'll also be.
Launching at the same times everything.
Else okay that is all i have without.
Further ado now let's see how i know i.
Make up routine.
Music.
So you're all primed and ready to go.
Yes the first step of your makeup.
Routine is foundation so here we have.
Nars two-phase and is that the order.
That they're in okay okay okay i'm.
Already noticing that this one's a.
Little bit more chunky.
Like not like chunky for like a little.
It's like a little bit thicker whereas.
Opposed like this one is definitely like.
A little bit more watery but i also.
Don't know when you put these in this.
Bowl so i'm noticing that these two.
Colors on the right hand are definitely.
A little bit more like neutral toned.
Which is good for me and this was a.
Little bit more peachy orange color so i.
Think i actually know exactly what the.
Order of these is okay and i do know it.
Okay that smells like paint that is.
Literal that is paint is this acrylic.
Paint that's not a funny joke if you did.
That to me is really okay i mean it's.
All like good paint like i would sniff.
That paint again okay okay this one's.
Much like stickier and i feels cold.
While going on that's not a familiar.
Feeling i do know what the three of.
These are i'm a genius.
Oh okay i know per thought that this one.
Is the too faced one i'm confident in.
That.
This is born this way for sure okay so i.
Know the goal this challenge is just to.
Pick out my favorite of the three and.
Then apply it but just for my ego sake i.
Said i want to try to label all three.
Just refine it so a final answer we have.
To boots but on this way.
Nars and then derive elimination.
Am i right well the sisters know but we.
Don't want to build your ego so we're.
Going.
See if i can drop me to the end i'm.
Gonna go ahead and wipe my three fingers.
Off that and i'm going to dip into my.
Amazing a to face for the safe.
Foundation that i know and love and use.
Every single day is this am i wrong oh i.
Think i'm right this is definitely born.
This way yeah cutter percent it's the.
Smell it smells very clean i know.
Music.
So now that your foundation is on yes to.
The next step yes.
So concealer here we lovely in front of.
You we have tarp shake.
Okay matt oh pro longwear yes oh okay.
This i am not covenant because i use the.
Tarp tape tape all the time i don't.
Think i've ever actually once used the.
Bond pro longwear concealer except for.
As an eye base and i just started using.
This away at coverage concealer recently.
But i don't think i'd like use it enough.
To know it's smell and texture yeah well.
I already see this one is a little bit.
Darker for sure and a little bit more.
Like peaches honed this one is super.
Super light and this one is like a very.
Like middle-of-the-road a type of.
Concealer that is quite the strong scent.
I don't know why but i think that's not.
Prolong wear this there's a shame shame.
I hardly ever said sure there's a shame.
It smells just like it shape team hasn't.
Very like clean almost like floral smell.
I have not a good with fragrance i have.
A person but this got on the hotter was.
That shard is a shave tape and that.
Means this smells like peanut butter.
Okay this is easy final answers you a.
Shape tape knock pro longwear okay so.
I'm gonna put my is you a full coverage.
Concealer and my mac pro longwear.
Concealer i know so don't play with me.
Now i'm going to grab my guitar shave.
Tape.
Then i use every single time and i'm.
Very familiar with the smell of miss.
Lewis i did my beautiful endure right.
Into it oh my god okay who sees so we've.
Gone through foundation and concealer.
Yes.
Next step is power yes please.
So in front of you today yes you have.
The too faced peaches these all look.
Exactly the same.
You have the airspun and you have.
Already off the bat i noticed in the.
Powder in the middle has it some chunks.
Than that this is no shade i know that.
The first batch of matcha powder that i.
Thought was a bad one but i know it's.
All my collection so i think that this.
Is it the powder powder is phenomenal by.
The way that's definitely that's the.
Powder powder that's a respond the smell.
Alone is enough to literally distinguish.
When this is literal grandma in a bowl.
And that smells amazing this is okay.
Easy the christmas game final answer.
Heiress pot pot check and the two-faced.
Sweet peach powder this stuff literally.
Smells so good.
Like it's insane i'm gonna use the sweet.
Peach powder for today and i'm gonna put.
Miss patrick airspun off to the side.

Team.
Morphia bronzer anasazi eye contour cat.
And hoola bronzer from benefit like.
Anything like anything either there does.
That oh god i don't even know if i can.
Get my finger in here okay so definite.
Little bit more orange a tone so this is.
Definitely a bronzer this middle one is.
A little bit more cool tone which leads.
Me to believe that it maybe the anasazi.
Won just because i know that this one is.
From a contour kit and this last one is.
Definitely a little bit more of a deeper.
Bronzy color that is benefit hoola.
Bronzer i have a very strong inkling.
Morphe anastacio betterment and for.
Today's video i'm gonna use the.
Anastacio contour color gonna grab my a.
Map 405 and just step right into this.
Beautiful little pan we have going on.
Right here okay doc just voyage puzzling.

Anasazi oh i'm gonna dip my morphe e62.

Created for my brush set into this.
Honest hacia hopefully contour color and.

Little bit before we move on to the next.
Step we do yes brows oh so we decide to.
Give you a break and let you do it like.
You okay great great okay i'm gonna do a.
Where i was quickly off care of that and.
I will be right back with you guys for.
The next step our resistance we are back.
In my eyebrows are looking nice and good.
And for us and snaps using actually my.
Anasazi eyebrow products as always and i.
Moving on to our next step which is i.
Think going to be if i don't get this.
Right i'm literally gonna be cancelled.
Oh which one has colors colors from each.
So we can match up the color okay i.
Music.
Honestly think that i know already but.
If i am wrong this is literally to be.
The most embarrassing thing that's ever.
Happened to me in a challenge before but.
Okay so here's here's where my brain is.
Going okay.
The left hand a pink shade has a little.
Bit of shimmer reflect in it which my.
Pink skip 100% does not have so i think.
This is from the new anasazi riviera.
Palette i think the middle row is mine.
Because out of these three like magenta.
Shades in the middle the one in the.
Middle is the most like burgundy whereas.
These two or more pink and i think that.
This left-hand column is jeffrey's.
Because this tone of pink is a little.
Bit more peachy which i think would be a.
Very jeffrey type of pink and this fella.
Needs a little bit more purple the black.
I have nothing so i'm just noting you.
Put them in the right order.
Jeffrey saw her husband james.
Charlesworth a palette in the middle and.
Okay i'm gonna put my two very dear.
Friends off to the side i will not be.
Using them today about i love people.
This is definitely skipped like i know.
For a fact this pink is just like too.
Bright to be somebody else's that's.
Definitely my baby oh my god i didn't do.
A swatch test before well that's better.
I think i'm gonna do a halo i look.
Inspired by the one that i did in my.
Campaign the bubble gum moment cuz i.
Literally could not think of another.
Look that i would want to use pink.
Burgundy and black for gonna dip with.
Miami four five six brush into skip it.
Skip.
I know it's skip and it's literally you.
Cannot tell me otherwise you see that.
Staining mama oh you know that is.
Definitely staining that's skip then.
With an amplifier most excited if into.
What i believe is boutique from my.
Palette i hope is boutique for my palate.
I know is boutique for my palate and.
Then finally with that same brush to.
Stepping into a little bit of a spooky.
The black color and using this to deepen.
Out just the internal corners.
Music.
All right you guys that is one hallo aya.
Using what i think is the james house.
And it's murphy palette all complete i'm.
Gonna do the one off-camera quickly and.
I'll be right back to move on to the.
Next step and quiz.
Alright sister through her back i just.
Popped on some mascara and lily lashes.
In this aisle so i strap miami's my team.
Apparently could not find dupes up.
Either of that yeah you got bored if.
Either suit god of course you guys can.
Use coatings for 50% off your chest but.
The look is pretty much all complete we.
Only have a few it stops left the next.
One being a highlighter i believe there.
Is a lot on the line as well.
Because we got face from your oh no we.
Have they all look exactly the same.
Oh yeah from the balm.
Okay so literally when i created face i.
Went into the morphe studio with like.
All of my favorite highlighters those.
Like i want to mix up all these and so.
Hollywood was like my biggest source of.
Inspiration for face.
Considering i always wore it they're.
Very similar colors i will let you know.
Right now that's all hey what doesn't.
Exist anymore but it does today mama.
Okay let me do a little swatch i'm gonna.
Do a swatch test beautiful.
Awesome beautiful i am almost positive.
That the this one on the left here is.
Mary-lou manizer from the balm because.
Out of the three swatches it is the.
Lightest and also the like least not.
Reflective but it's a very like flat.
Shape whereas both these two definitely.
Have like later pearls and darker pearls.
In it mary lou manizer is very flat and.
I remember that from always using it.
Beforehand so i'm pretty confident that.
This one is miss mary lu we can.
Eliminate her okay so now between these.
Two i think i do now this top one is.
Slightly more gold tone than the one.
Below it this one is a little bit more.
Peachy which leads me to believe that.
The top one is honest asya so hollywood.
And the middle one is faced from the.
James charles exploring palette and the.
Bottom one would be mary lou manizer.
From the balm mary lu james charles x.
Murphy.
Anasazi so hollywood oh that is.
Definitely my highlighter.
Music.
So games yes louis.
God bless my quiz is over okay lipstick.
Sao paulo my family yes okay what are.
Your first thoughts the middle one is.
Dark i'm augustus melhem is what i'm.
Actually going to do this is over a.
Hundred percent over lipsticks smell.
Like cupcakes 100 percent old from sao.
Paulo and positive this is kylie i know.
This is kylie because i've used her lips.
Like so many times definitely kylie okay.
Uh-huh house passive-aggressive she's.
Gonna dip into my lovely sau paula look.
A lipstick that i do love which you can.
Use ko james for 30% off off by the way.
Mmm tastes like cupcakes okay how did i.
Do i don't know okay my face looks very.
Normal like this looks like i created a.
Normal look using a normal product so.
I'm gonna hope that i got pretty close.
To a hundred percent right so you.
Definitely get a point if you guess the.
One you usually use yeah but it's bonus.
If you guess the others.
Okay so for foundation we had nars yes.
Two things.
Yes and brent oh yes you did guess too.
Faced correct thank god.
Okay you did not guess those two really.
Music.
Okay and trusting concealer yeah oh.
Thanks something this great some.
Heart-shaped a powder bronzer yeah this.
Is very well okay in my defense i try to.
Change this and you will not let me.
Wow you guess that the one on the right.
Was morphe yeah that is correct.
Okay you guessed the one in the middle.
Was on saskia yeah upon that i used as.
Incorrect.
The one in the middle that you use was.
Hoola bronzer for your contour really.
Mm-hmm okay i'm trusting asha.
Oh god you guess the darkest one was on.
Sascha that's incorrect the darkest our.
Weight the darkest on when you meet the.
Darkest one oh yeah when you use honest.
Hacia charles x morphe palette oh my god.
You have got to be just wild crazy i.
Mean i'm not mad about it because like.
Anasazi shadows are literally fantastic.
