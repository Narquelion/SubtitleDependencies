Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel i.
Just want to go ahead and jump right.
Into the intro for today's video because.
I've been wanting to do this for.
Literally so long now i am so excited.
And i do think that this is probably.
Gonna be one of the longest videos that.
I ever upload to this channel so saddle.
Up get ready because for today's video.
We're doing my first ever full on drive.
Transformation now you're probably.
Thinking sister james what are you.
Talking about we've seen you do drive so.
Many times on instagram and here in.
Youtube and yes you're definitely not.
Wrong what i actually think is really.
Really cool and almost like a.
Sentimental part of this video is that i.
Started to make up three years ago now.
And because of the fact that i started.
On instagram all of my looks are.
Actually documented in photo for you.
Guys to see including my chart makeup.
The first ever time that i did jog was.
Probably about two years ago now and it.
Was this photo inspired by raven a.
Legendary queen from season two and.
Honestly should have been winner of.
Rupaul's drag race as well as every.
Other time that i've done drawing after.
That i will confidently say that through.
A lot of mistakes a lot of misplaced.
Eyebrows and a lot of practice by drag.
Makeup abilities have definitely gotten.
A whole lot better and of course they've.
Gotten some pretty nice wigs as well but.
That's kind of about it i've been a.
Major fan of rupaul's drag race and a.
Supporter of someone including that have.
Both been on the show and all for a very.
Very long time now the drag community.
Has influenced my personality sense of.
Humor and also makeup skills with.
Different tips and techniques so so so.
Much throughout the past three years and.
I'm generally so honored to be in the.
Lgbtq community with amazing drag queens.
That being said though even though.
Drying and dry queens have been such a.
Major source of inspiration to me at a.
Huge part of my life it is an artform.
That i don't really know that much about.
As an outsider and as a fan i have even.
Made the mistake and looking at drag.
Queens on stage looking beautiful and.
Fierce as just a man and a wig and a.
Dress absolutely killing it when in.
Reality there is so much more that goes.
Into actually being performance ready.
With both the skills and putting the.
Look together so for today's video i.
Thought i'd be really really cool to.
Take a topic that i love and abso.
But can be educated on because i'm.
Ignorant towards and really just take a.
Full-on deep dive into the world to jog.
And see what it actually takes to put.
Together a go luck in time for a major.
Special event or performance i thought.
It'd be the perfect time to take on this.
Challenge because i'm actually flying to.
New york very very soon to work on some.
Super-secret sister projects and while.
I'm gonna be there coincidentally drakon.
New york city is going to be happening.
And what better place to try out being a.
Dropping for the first time ever then at.
Drakon a little convention filled the.
Dry queens that i have loved and looked.
Up to for so long the only issues are.
That i'm currently in the process of.
Moving and then i leave for new york in.
Less than two weeks so this is gonna be.
Quite the time crunch we have two weeks.
To pull off this full-on drive.
Transformation can we do it let's get.
Started.
Music.
All right so we have two weeks until it.
Dry condi are actually happens i think.
In order to have success in this i need.
To split up my focus into four different.
Categories which i figured out are the.
Body the outfit the hair and the makeup.
And i think i actually need to hit them.
In that order as well starting on for.
The body because of course like the body.
Is gonna affect the fitting which look.
Back to the gown and then i just pick.
The hair or based on the gown and then i.
Need to pick the makeup based on.
Everything altogether i think i.
Definitely need to pour most of my.
Attention into the body first because.
That's gonna be by far probably the.
Hardest part of this entire.
Transformation i don't exactly have much.
To work with you guys know from my.
Several accidental but picks that i post.
It on snapchat there isn't a whole lot.
There in order to give myself a little.
Bit more sister shape i'm really going.
For that hourglass figure i need to get.
Two different things being padding and a.
Corset i'm not exactly sure how i'm.
Gonna do my padding yet which has me.
Very very stressed out but we're gonna.
Figure it out we always do but i do know.
How i'm gonna do it my corset i reached.
Out to a ton of my drive friends and.
Conveniently as well the try guys which.
Are a huge channel here on youtube just.
Did a video last week where they got.
Corset fitted so i reached out to the.
Same shop they're called what katydid.
Located in burbank california and i have.
An appointment in about 30 minutes from.
Now for a corset fitting i'm gonna go in.
And get sister snatched so i'm gonna.
Call it.
And let's head over and see how much of.
A skinny legend i could be today.
Music.
Music.
She's been waist training for about 30.
Years.
Whoa hundreds of styles of custom.
Courses and everything and we've kind of.
A drive back to these several different.
Styles now the extremely high quality.
Through an everyday few years if you.
Want to yeah oh yeah we have a lot of.
Really famous drag performers that use.
These as their base for their costumes.
As soon as i talk to my designer about.
Mean of course i he's like um yeah it's.
A wonderful place to start out find a.
Corset that works for you and there are.
What really wonderful price okay so the.
Fitting is like this we take your.
Natural waist measurement no then we go.
Four to six inches down and that wall.
Your versat size of your arm let's do it.
We're gonna go through the mortician.
We're dog look yeah oh yeah great great.
To pad out i would i would try it on an.
Extreme.
This one will work for your your padding.
Okay i like this one for me because the.
Regular my tisha pushes on my ribs a lot.
And a young breathe as much young i get.
Anxiety when i can't breathe.
But this one it puts all the pressure on.
My waist which i like oh yeah so you.
Have tons of padding room you can pop.
Them in the butt you compat your hips.
Out and you have tons of room for that.
Then you have a teeny little waist yeah.
And then once you pad it out it'll look.
Even teeny.
Oh my lord this is crazy and so cool.
250 186 perfect it was matched alright.
So we just turned out of what katie did.
Literally everybody there was so beyond.
Eyes and so sweet i am ready to be.
Sisters snatched a little bit of the.
Flops were sticking out of the science.
Because they're normally meant for more.
Curvy people but that is what we have it.
Padding forward i don't know how we're.
Gonna do this yet but we're gonna figure.
It out alright so now that our body is.
Off knot and ready to go now we're able.
To move on to the way i reach out to.
Wake the great who is a huge insanely.
Talented wig stylist she does wig for so.
Many queensland drivers including kimchi.
And i asked her if she'd be willing to.
Fit in the end for a last-minute wig for.
A jog on she actually did say gasps that.
She was going to try to fit in a custom.
Wig for a jog on which i am so excited.
For but we only have the one week of.
Time to do this which is cutting it very.
Very close so we just go to the facetime.

Figure out what we're going to do so.

Rock on earth now tomorrow and the one.
Less thing we have not gone yeah our.
Shoes so i'm currently at steve madden.
And i'm having it slow because i just.
Ride on a size 9 which is my normal shoe.
Size and i could not get my left foot in.
And my right foot was slipping so i've.
Now gone conclusion that if i want to be.
A woman i have to wear to two sizes that.
Are literally a completely different so.
I am not trying an 8 and a half on my.
Right foot at a nine and a half on my.
Left foot.
And i'm really gonna buy two different.
Pairs of shoes that no overwatch.
52 p.m. ja ronn.
Is now in t-minus 14 hours i have.
Everything that i need but i am still.
Really really nervous for tomorrow and.
I'm not exactly sure why i think that i.
Have my look altogether but the one.
Thing that i'm really missing before.
This whole video is like a lesson on how.
To like actually be a drag queen and i.
Think that because i've been planning.
All this so quickly and because i just.
Moved and because now i'm traveling that.
It kind of slipped my mind but that was.
A really important thing that i should.
Not have skipped over so i do have a few.
Friends that i know are in thai way now.
For the actual convention tomorrow so i.
Think i'm going to do cross my fingers.
And send out a few texts and pray that i.
Can get somebody over here tonight to.
Talk to me and hope we hope they call me.
Nerves also talk to you guys it's all.
Because i think obviously i'm trying.
This out for the first time but it'd be.
Really cool to actually hear the.
Perspective of somebody that does it for.
A living but doesn't every single day.
That it's great at this and to maybe.
Speak on what it's like to be a what.
These are grateful to me and to anybody.
Else out there who is of trying it out.
So i'm going to send out a few times and.
I'm going to become some makeup.
Inspiration for tomorrow and i'm going.
To walk in the hills a little bit and.
I'm going to try to calm myself down.
I'll see you guys in a little bit break.
You guys it is currently 10 o'clock p.m.
Oh literally on the dock mom tina.
Punctuality and i have joined today with.
Asha a legendary new york city-based.
Charlie from brooklyn she is so talented.
And a good friend might as well so sir.
Hi i thought it'd be so much fun for us.
To kind of like sit down and talk.
Together about tomorrow because tomorrow.
Is new york city yeah i am so nervous.
And you've always been a really really.
Great friend and mentor implyin even.
I've only done driving a few times i.
Thought i'd be really great for us to.
Like sit down together.
To talk about like the whole job process.
Because as i told you i'm doing a penny.
Where i do like my first name ever in.
Fall on track and i thought like doing.
John deere extending as i first like.
Public appearance could have a really.
Fun and fresh but now i'm like really.
Nervous about it too like a lot of.
Different reasons i thought like it'd be.
Best to get it by someone who's like.
Working in the fields i'm like doing it.
Really well too okay see we're gonna.
Have to like dean nervousness eyes you.
Because i ever know if it's a word but.
The thing about it is that i think drag.
Is all about confidence yeah.
When you're in that juche yes you have.
To just feel it like you don't know what.
Insecure dragons.
You're gonna shine no matter what right.
And you're really good at makeup i saw.
You did this one transformation it was.
The first transformation you did where.
You said that you were going for a very.
Natural look.
Yes it was really good and it was it was.
Just the perfect blend of natural and.
Like the stereotypical like drag makeup.
If it's anything like that that you're.
Doing i can imagine that everything else.
Is gonna be just like in order to like.
Pull this actually off i've been working.
With a lot of like the industry.
Professionals and like the top of the.
Top to hope i look together.
Um casius adventure asks and it wakes.
And grace in my hair and then wrinkle.
Into my jewelry and then i do my makeup.
I'm not the best of the best but i have.
Pretty zit with a blending brush i will.
Say so it's not really the look that i.
Am worried about because i know that i'm.
Actually in good hands i'm more worried.
About like the drag community because i.
Felt like not the best relationship with.
The drag community in the past and i'm.
Really scared because the dry community.
People that i look up to a lot like i've.
Been watching drag race that balding.
Dark beans on social media literally.
Like extend season and from way.
Beforehand.
I've got so many that my voice looked up.
To so many of them including you out.
There santos that's before and it's kind.
Of scary because although i love a lot.
Of people i know for a lot of them the.
Feeling isn't mutual.
Which is fun but it's a little bit of a.
Scary thought because it's a community.
That i respect and by doing driving for.
The first time i don't want to walk in.
There and disrespect anybody we'll be.
Fine because honestly drag is very.
Inclusive especially in a safe space.
Like drakon you will be respected and.
It's just like i think about everybody.
Does drag technically you've been doing.
Drag right celebrities you drag all the.
Time nicki minaj lady gaga like i.
There's so many different ways to look.
At drag it's not just like assist mail.
And address sometimes it's just like.
James charles doing makeup.
That's your drag that's your drive.
Nobody can tell you different but if.
People don't support you from the drag.
Community those are just little pieces.
They can really like get over themselves.
Because you are a person and we're all.
People in the community i support you.
And i know a lot of other people do.
Support you there as well so you will be.
Welcome and you know you're gonna have.
Fans there as well people who are going.
To be like going but nanos when they see.
You i hope there will be some sister.
Service where i haven't actually.
Announced that i'm coming yet so sister.
Surprise i don't know who's gonna be.
There what is going to be like the.
Hardest part about being a job tomorrow.
The worst three things about being a.
Drag in my opinion to me are one.
Blotting you have to touch up your.
Makeup very frequently especially when.
People want to take pictures like it's.
Very handy to have someone who has a.
Touch-up near you or even just like for.
The girls on the go have a little powder.
Puff in your paranoids do so that one's.
Taken care of already girl you don't.
Want to look like a oil pit in the pigs.
And then also the feet walking in heels.
All day when you're not used to wearing.
Heels by this point i have hoes i am.
Basically a horse.
I'm used to it that's what i'm most.
Scared about i will say number three.
Would have to be the end of the day.
Being in drag all day is so different.
From being in drag.
All night when you're in driving all day.
The lighting especially if you're.
Wearing contacts and lashes it just like.
Makes your eyes tired and heavy.
And then when it's time to get out of.
Drag it's like you slowly start peeling.
At all like a second and third skin and.
Then you kind of just look at it and.
You're just like how am i alive you're.
Gonna be so tired your feet or the vm.
Pain and you're gonna be like how am i.
Alive but while you're doing it the.
Fantasy is still turned on yeah that it.
Just doesn't matter like except the.
Shoes remember.
Break some flats oh that's gonna be hard.
So speaking of getting like your.
Signature look all together the one.
Thing that i've noticed throughout doing.
This transformation today and obviously.
Of course i am working with on the top.
Of the top this is very expensive it.
Does cost money usually to be beautiful.
But drawing on a budget is something as.
Well i guess my question for you is like.
Obviously i guess that gets blurred you.
Onto a bigger platform where anyone to.
Get tons of pigs but your boys book.
Dialog like watching before put some on.
Your stories seems it was so amazing but.
Beforehand everybody's kind of like a.
Queen on a budget just like any others.
You have to buy materials store on your.
Mark warm what advice would you give to.
Smaller creeks that want to start out.
Doing drugs and how does drive on a.
Budget really work for me before i was.
Given the platform of drag race i had to.
Learn to make everything myself that was.
The real way to stay on the budget is.
You want to look nice but as nice as you.
Want to look the also have to like save.
The money right you're not getting paid.
Enough to look the way you look you can.
Go to the club and even if i did my own.
Wig i had to pay maybe fifty bucks for.
The wig and then it's like the ten.
Dollars for the hairspray and then the.
Brush and the column the dress was maybe.
A forty dollar dress i got off the block.
But i still bought a $20 pack oh mr.
Oscar ryan shows 2-digit up yeah you.
Know the makeup the shoes i'm a size 14.
My feet can fit into canoes like little.
Boat find the way to learn to do.
Everything yourself yeah that's the hard.
Thing because showing is not easy doing.
Hair is annoying unless you really have.
The patience and the time girl now when.
I get my wig made by gloria from wigs.
And grace like i'm just like thank you.
For saving my life and making me look.
Like a trout like.
Catfish more like angelfish oh majestic.
I guess my last question for you is if.
You kind of already it slightly touched.
On this but just to give like an overall.
Answer for myself and for any other.
Young kids out there who want to try out.
Dry what did the best he said overall i.
Think the best advice for anybody is.
Really just know the reason you're doing.
Drag or find the reason through drag.
Itself because for some people drag is.
Their art form for some people who are.
Fond of dragons their medium to show.
Their talents and for some people it's.
To help them find themselves some people.
Discover their trends to drag some.
People discover who they are for me drag.
Is very therapeutical so i think the.
Biggest advice is to use drag however.
You can to help yourself and help yeah.
But like also if you can't help yourself.
First you'll never be able to help other.
People so i used to be like super insane.
With it like i had so much anxiety and.
So much depression and you know teenage.
Angst idea and i started doing drag and.
I did slowly like kind of picked myself.
Up and i didn't have anybody around me.
And i just kind of found a person in me.
And i learned to love myself and i took.
That message and i started to teach it.
To other people so when i see like.
Queens who you know may not look the.
Best or like look like they don't have.
The funds i never sit there make fun of.
Them or be like oh wow because you don't.
Know where people come from right even.
If like they don't look their best.
Instead of saying something like oh look.
At her like she looks busted going up to.
Them and just saying hi introducing.
And you know saying like i'm happy.
You're doing this because anybody who's.
Trying to drag deserve some type of.
Recognition and everyone has to start.
Somewhere as oh yes like people think.
That you wake up overnight and you're.
Just like the glam squad and you're.
Decide oh yeah it's like girl that's why.
I was like nervous for this video too.
Because i'm obviously very blessed and.
Privileged to be able to work with the.
Team so i really appreciate getting your.
Acceptance weren't an issue for a very.
Very long time and it's my problem like.
Trying out driving a little baby driving.
For the first time to like being the.
Superstar queen i think people will see.
What you're doing and will see that.
You're using your platform to also like.
Further what you learned and they will.
Learn from that as well so i think that.
What you're doing is cool it is risky.
Because like i know why you're nervous.
Right but i guarantee people are gonna.
Look at this and they're gonna think.
That you're brave and they're gonna.
Think that it's cool and they're gonna.
Want to try it too.
Well thank you so much to super joining.
Me today this really has actually helped.
Me a lot like all my nerves i'm a really.
Good about this i'm sure by the time i.
Wake up tomorrow morning the feeling.
That's may be bad but i'm gonna just go.
Into it my office'll all give it my best.
And just one absolutely fierce than.
Fabulous and i'll see you there if you.
Don't come see me first i'm getting.
Assess your security to escort you.
Around i just happened to wake up this.
30 i set.
My alarm for 8 o'clock and i woke up and.
My alarm is still on somehow but it's.
30 here in new york my timezone.
Literally to not stress on my phone and.
Now i'm 2 hours late good morning.
00 a.m. this is not good i'm so.
Mad like i cannot believe i'm gonna.
Start off with looing dollar of my.
Eyebrows because i have man eyebrows and.
I need to not have those today so flat.
That's what we want.
So once the glues like on there and.
Brushed up a little bit i'm actually.
Gonna take a wet washcloth and just go.
Over some of those edges really really.
Lightly just to kind of blend them in it.
To my nostrils again so now we need the.
Glue to dry before we move on to the.
Next layer what do we do to make them.
Dry you ass.
Let me tell you damn coming soon just a.
Source ass apparel hog so now that my.
Brows are both glued down and basically.
Almost i am is gonna take my favorite.
Loose powder and grab quite a lot of it.
And just a powder puff and i'm going to.
Press that right over top of the brow to.
Lock them in place and also to put any.
Remaining powder inside of any little.
Gaps just make sure they're super super.
Smooth.
Approximately three videos ago now you.
Guys all heard me say color corrector.
Usually stupid i have never color.
Corrected in a million years guess that.
I'm about to do call it cracked because.
I am a man my beard is showing a lot for.
Some reason today in the last several.
Weeks i need to get laser hair removal.
Right now so we're getting starting off.
The foundations hey i'm gonna grab my.
Kryla tv paint stick so this one is in.
The shade nb which is not my shade i'm.
Gonna go over top of this with.
Foundation and they're very short a.
Second but this is the a super intense.
Full coverage foundation like literally.
It's like cement so what i'm gonna do is.
Go like this.
Now this looks disgusting so i'm gonna.
Take my to pay for this a foundation.
Which you guys know is my all-time.
Favorite and go over time for that so it.
Looks less crazy so now i need to.
Highlight my face and when it comes to.
Drag makeup obviously drives all of a.
High-contrast so instead of grabbing a.
Concealer what i'm going to do is grab a.
White foundation this is the krell on tv.
Paint stick once again but this is in.
The shade at 0-0 and the stuff is.
Actually really really bomb i love using.
This and i'm just going to curl like.
This okay so normally i'm without my.
Face in place right now but i think i'm.
Actually gonna do my eyebrows first so i.
Can powder over top of them to lock them.
In i normally would never do this i.
Don't know why i would take a rest on a.
Day like this but we're gonna do it all.
Right.
Now as for the jawline i'm going to.
Contour up my jaw as usual just really.
Chelsa out there because we don't want a.
Double chin but when it comes to the.
Corners of my jaw line we're gonna do.
Something sad then i'm gonna take my big.
Round fluffy brush this is the m5 27 and.
Dip into that same middle tone shade a.
Little bit but mostly into the kind of.
Left or caramel shade and i'm gonna use.
This as like a bronzer to marry together.
My natural skin tone and the contour.
Shade just make everything blend really.
Seamlessly low-key happy with how i'm.
Looking so far so now we're gonna move.
On to the eye makeup so i'm gonna do.
First is grab one of these weird cards.
At the hotel has in here and we're to.
Rip it in half and i'm gonna use these.
To actually frame out my winged liner.

Working the shoes are gone long sleeves.
Pretty early on but today amazing i'm.
Gonna head back to the hotel and d drive.
And take all this off because i.
Literally feel like i'm about to die.
Today was so much work and i want to.
Tell you guys all about my experience.
The good at the bad and the ugly so.
Let's call it over and i will see you.
Guys in a few shots oh my god i've never.
Been in more pain in my entire life.
My okay i'm glad my skin is still alive.
You're dying for that corset to come off.
Now i tied this really tight so just.
Give me a minute.
Cuz it's been on your 400 come on.
I'm trying room turn around turn around.
What does it look like you look like the.
Predator i don't know that's the only.
Way i can describe this back my toes.
Hurt so much.
Oh my god this has been the longest day.
Of my entire life i look disgusting like.
I'm scared.
Hello my normal makeup i can keep on.
Filling a few hours during the day i.
Like get over that this no i can't today.
Was insane.
Like absolutely insane i was so nervous.
You know there's like a lot of things.
That i was worried about my outfit my.
Hair my makeup looking good because my.
Drag makeup has definitely been quite.
The roller coaster for me my shoes which.
Obviously did not exactly end up working.
Out but you know what it's okay i took.
Them off there were a lot of other.
Creams that has their shoes off it's a.
Little walking around in slippers or.
Barefoot which i thought was so iconic.
So i definitely was not the only one.
That wanted to go for the talent but the.
Thing that i was most nervous about what.
We're all was actually meeting so many.
These things that have looked up to.
Forever because of the fact that i don't.
Exactly have the best reputation in the.
Chart world it's been a community that.
I've loved forever but i've really tried.
To stay away from in order to avoid.
Trauma just because it's something that.
Happened in our own two years ago with.
And me cutting a line and a security.
Guard very very well that's right that i.
Don't really need to get into but it was.
A complete misunderstanding and.
Now a lot of the drug fans don't like me.
So that's great every single queen that.
I read today was literally you so beyond.
Nice i'm gonna answer some of the photos.
Here with the creeps that take photos.
With and they were also incredibly.
Supportive and how does such nice things.
That's they have it my first time in.
Iraq so many the queen's actually didn't.
Recognize me at first until i said my.
Sister and then they were like oh my god.
What just watching that reaction was.
Actually so incredibly cool so many of.
Them said the way make up look beautiful.
Though they did not recognize me which.
Is definitely a good thing because it.
Means i did a good job of camouflaging.
Myself and becoming a sister superstar.
At rockwood i was also able to meet so.
Many of you sisters as well was just.
Always so crazy to me i did not notice.
That i was going to draw a gun obviously.
Because they wanted this whole video to.
Be like a little bit of a sister.
Surprise so surprise but so many of you.
Guys have found me right away after i.
Posted a snapchat my hotel room this.
Morning and my finished look and we.
Liberation up the convention time which.
Is    what i thought that i already.
Had like the absolute highest level of.
Respect for john queens before even.
Going into this video but let me tell.
You that bar has been raised.
Literally like through the roof although.
I had so much fun today this is probably.
One of the most physically challenging.
Experiences i have ever had in my entire.
Life wearing that corset all day long is.
So incredibly painful my back literally.
Looked like it was about to turn purple.
And like fall but literally like it was.
So hard to breathe in the walker on the.
Entire day working with sister alex for.
The gala wasn't so much fun because he's.
Moving so talented and i think for next.
Time i do drug i am probably am not.
Quinn to get a gown as beautiful as i.
Looked walking around with a train all.
Day was so hard.
Spent so much money on that gown and.
Every penny and that was worth it but.
The entire bottom of it is covered with.
Footprints from people stepping on all.
Day long so definitely need a body suit.
For the next and the shoes let me tell.
You about the shoes apparently i learned.
Through this lesson that my feet are two.
Very different sizes great did not know.
That how i went 19 years without packing.
In this now i don't know but apparently.
It's not be looking for a pair of white.
High heels.
So and now we know aside from the.
Physical pain ups in a little bit this.
Experience has been so much fun and i am.
So beyond glad that i did it it's truly.
One my favorite experiences that i've.
Had to take to sink everybody walk.
Around and their wigs and makeup and.
Crazy hair and outfits expressing.
Themselves like what a beautiful and.
Amazing thing this has been such an.
Incredible and eye-opening experience.
For me because obviously i've done drag.
So many different times on instagram but.
I've never done my full try all right.
You guys my skin is thought sooner well.
Now i'm going to lay down in bed and.
Probably face my big toes and also get a.
