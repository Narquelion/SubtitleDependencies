He's extremely hot and i fell in love.
With him but we were just best friends.
To clarify because we still get.
Questions all the time even though we've.
Disclosed in every single video so.

Hurt memory of me and victor together is.
Probably honestly like right now i know.
That sounds so stupid but i've been.
Trying to get victor to this video with.

Iconic i'm gonna set victor's brown.
Place using the uh nastasia tinted brow.
Gel the shirt is for us so that right.

You be if i just want fries that are.
Amazing the morphe 35o eyeshadow palette.
I'm gonna do a halo eye on victor.
Because know like we should do something.
Fun why do you think of halo eye is.
Gonna consist of i don't know what is it.
You know well a halo eye mr. victor.
Basically we're gonna have the darker.
Shade on the outside yeah and then.
There's gonna be like a pop of.
Brightness in the metal is it okay i'm.
Just gonna start off using my sigma e35.
A tape or blending brush and put this.
Dark e orange shade into the crease line.
Under season this shade is my transition.
Color i'm really not going to try to do.
Like too dark or too intense my halo id.
I want this to be like really light and.
Soft especially because if we stay here.
For seven hours doing a lock on victor.
I'll probably end up stabbing me so x.
Under grab my morphe r39 brush and dip.
Into a medium of brown orange e shade.
Twos as like the trend.
To start off deepening the halo effect.
Use coe james wow that's rude daddy.
Right there i'm really focusing that.
Color on the outer and inner corners of.
The eye and then budding up into the.
Creases the slightest bat but making.
Sure to leave the middle of the lid.
Nice and light in kind of empty next is.
That same exact brush i'm going to dip.
Into a little bit darker of a brown.
Shade and then place that on the very.
Inner and outer corners all right.
Did you really and i'm gonna get murphy.
Advant 1 4 9 i grab my darkest brown and.
Really deep it up the internal corner as.
That like last final darkening shade.
They say right here yeah once you use.
Them a lot of times i have liver eyes.
Just how you memorize like locations in.
The warehouse where the clothes go and.
You're speaking my language when you get.
Like a fine dinner or annoyed you hear.
Really really mad and then you're really.
Annoying about it like you can.
Take a tack look and i'm like you don't.
Listen to anything anybody else says you.
Being annoying that it that makes me.
Feel like that well great answer but it.
Is when you think you're always right.
That's living you though no you both.
That way no yes no thank you yeah the.
Difference the difference is you always.
Think you're right so do you well know.
Yes i keep quiet when i think i'm right.
But there's some things that you miss.
I don't think so squirrel i keep.
Quite a lot of times the things you say.
That i couldn't have a pinion no but i.
Don't say it because it's not worth it.
But when i feel like you're truly wrong.
Is when i i step in and i say something.
Sweet way.
How does it feel know that i'm 18 and.
I'm no longer your legal responsibility.
As a father it's great freemen i get rid.
Of you for 18 years i'm gonna grab my.
Mac 242 brush in a little bit of the.
Urban decay all later as you just saw.
And i'm gonna put this right on the.
Center of effectors lit as like the.
Brightness for the halo i.
Then going back into my r39 person.
That's gonna make sure that those edges.
Are really really it diffused out for.
