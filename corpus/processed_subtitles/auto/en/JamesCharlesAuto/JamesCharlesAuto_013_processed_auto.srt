Better be here you better know.
All right you guys beer back home now.
After the dance class but i'm actually.
Filming this outro a few days later i.
Already felt mess but i wanted to redo.
It right before i'm uploading this video.
Because you will not believe what my.
Body has went through in the past few.
Days at this point i don't even really.
Know if i can believe it i like very.
Very confused because doing the routine.
Was very very hard but it was hard.
Because i'm not good at like hand i put.
Full body coordination at memorizing a.
Routine like that and being able to put.
On a performance at the same time is.
Very very hard i gave it the dancers so.
Much props it was also very very hot in.
There so i was sweating in my entire.
Face and makeup off but physically the.
Actual like steps were not hard on my.
Body but for some reason i woke up the.
Next morning so sore but over the past.
Two days it is got so much i like people.
Literally barely even walk and i am.
Getting very very worried i sat in the.
Hot tub for several hours i've tried one.
Of the muscle rollers whoa my friends it.
Gives me massages.
And my knees are just not exactly.
Functioning so i'm not sure if this is.
Normal because this is my first time.
Dancing but this is literally the most.
Pain i've ever ever been in and this.
Just goes to show how incredible and how.
Much work and love and physical strength.
That goes into the actual art of dancing.
I went to this challenge today already.
Having have so much respect for.
Everybody in the dance industry.
Everybody from the dancers the.
Choreographers and the actual teachers.
As well there's so much that goes into.
Putting together a beautiful routine and.
Just getting to kind of see the behind.
The scenes process and be a part of the.
Job 1 for a few seconds was so much fun.
And just maybe respect it that much more.
I'm very very grateful to both abby lee.
Miller and the dance moms.
And the girls that were there in the.
Studio helping me out and being so so so.
Patient with me i'm horrified to know.
How much i would have gotten yelled at.
If i wasn't a youtuber and i was an.
Actual dance student abby's an.
Incredible teacher and it's really.
Obvious that she has so much passion for.
These girls is wanting them to be the.
Best interest they possibly can be and.
Who knows maybe i could be a performer.
One day probably not with that.
