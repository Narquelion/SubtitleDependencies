Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel.
Lately i've been travelling so much.
Doing so many fun and crazy things but.
Because of that i have not have time to.
Sit down and do a crazy makeup look in a.
Long time i've gotten really great at.
This point doing my everyday makeup.
Routine and this is a look right here.
That i always go for it's very very.
Similar to my normal glam just less of.
Each product and it's a lot more.
Simplistic i went with dewy skin fluffy.
Brows light on the eyes simple liner and.
Lashes and of course a nude lip i also.
Popped on my clear aviators which i've.
Been rocking a ton lately and you guys.
Have been loving them they're certainly.
My favorite accessory right now if you.
Guys like to see how i created this look.
Right here make sure you keep on.
Watching some first gotta sort of as.
Always cry my face use my benefit.
Porefessional primer i'm going into the.
Laura primer tonight i just got back.
From a long time being away from home.
I was in punta cana with rachel you guys.
Saw the vlog that i was in california.
For a few weeks then i went to maui or.
Tottie's wedding it was so much fun now.
I'm back home for just one week to.
Finish up high school then i'm finally.
Done thank god and i get to move and.
Let's start my career up in la i am so.
Freaking excited but my skin is not.
Enjoying being back in the new york.
Weather i think i'm just like really.
Stressed out but i'm getting a pretty.
Bad break out and i'm really not too.
Happy about it.
We're gonna conceal don't feel don't let.
Them know not today at least so glad to.
Be home as always i'm gonna probably.
Nose using my morphe r32 brush and my.
Mac studio finish concealer you guys.
Should know why i do this by now my nose.
Contour tends to do is slip and slide.
Around because my nose is super oily so.
Putting the extra layer on there.
Even on my everyday makeup routine.
Really helps everything to stay in place.
The foundation i'm gonna grab my make up.
For ever ultra hd stick in the shade at.
Y at 315 and i'm just gonna start trying.
That on my face i've been getting a lot.
Of comments lately saying like james you.
Use all the same products so you just.
Switch up and at first i was like.
This is my channel and then i was like.
You're kind of right though and i.
Thought about it some more and i was.
Like you know what i am not someone who.
Does reviews i'm not someone who test.
Out new products very often i kind of do.
A lot of crazy makeup books as you guys.
Know and i.
Hazily do simple glam like this i've.
Been traveling so much lately which is.
Why you guys have been seeing so much.
Simple super easy kind of boring on my.
Uncertain future because they haven't.
Had time release it then i do crazy.
Looks but i really like the products.
That i work with and i tend to not.
Switch them up just because that's what.
Really works for me occasionally new.
Things always do make it into my routine.
Like brushes i shut up health and stuff.
Like that but for the most part my.
Babies remains the same because this is.
What really works for my skin type i.
Have a pretty complicated skin i know.
It'll look good every single time so i.
Tend to not switch it up very much sorry.
There are plenty of other youtube.
Channels out there in the world if you.
Want to look at some new products but i.
Get to find shape type concealer from.
Tarte i'm going to highlight my face.
Anyways moving on i'm just blending this.
In with my damp beauty blender then i'm.
Going to drive just a tiny bit of the.
Kat von d while concealer and just make.
A few dots under my eyes and in the side.
Of my forehead same place i put the.
Concealers obviously not using as much.
As this because we don't want to look.
Too pale but i'm pretty pasty already so.
I like to add as much contrast to my.
Face as possible if you are new.
Subscriber coming from a tati channel.
Hello i hope you enjoyed our wedding.
Makeup video together i just came back.
From maui and i got to go to her wedding.
Which was so much fun literally one of.
The most beautiful and fun experiences.
Of my entire life.
It was just so crazy because i've been.
Watching talk to you for like probably.
Three years now almost and three years.
Ago i called myself one of her biggest.
Fans and now after doing makeup for only.
A year and a half i got to go to her.
Wedding and do her makeup for her.
Wedding what you thought is so crazy so.
It's so cool how the internet like.
Brings people together i don't know if.
They keep story okay it's going to.
Quickly blend out the creases underneath.
My eyes then going with the laura.
Mercier translucent setting powder.
I have not uses in a long long time i'm.
Next i got my mac studio fix foundation.
Powder and my morphe 48 and put that in.
The same place i put my concealer.
Basically my like super easy a rare-book.
Lay on that makeup routine is the exact.
Same as my like full-on glam crazy.
Makeup routine i'll just use a whole lot.
Less of the same products - bronson face.
Today i'm gonna using the comedy show.
You the light kit shocking and i'm gonna.
Use this new brush from the more via.
Copper collection these brushes are so.
Freakin pretty i actually have yet to.
Use them i just got home.
I said so i just got a chance to open up.
All my pr packages oh my god i've been.
In love with copper lately you guys have.
No idea how excited i am to move out and.
Decorate my own place literally walking.
It's my house it's gonna be like walking.
Into a pinterest board and i literally.
Cannot wait this brush is actually so.
Good for contouring and bronzy i'm kind.
Of shook right now it's much more dense.
Than i'm used to but it puts in the.
Color like really really nicely what is.
The name of this oh it doesn't have a.
Name okay maybe you actually have to buy.
The entire set together either i.
Remember you can always use code james.
For 10% of all products at morphe y'all.
Know that they are one of my favorites.
I'm really lightly gonna use mine at jd.
Maybe 180 brush to contour my nose i'm.
Still gonna sum it down using the middle.
Shade off the pallet like always but i'm.
Not gonna go as heavy as normal just.
Because this is everyday makeup and not.
Something so intense and drive be yeah.
Next to make my face i'm gonna take more.
Of my out laura mercier translucent.
Powder and this brush from the morphia.
Copper collection and dip it in and then.
Tap on the powder so while my face.
Thanks for a few minutes i'm gonna go.
Ahead and go and can it start an up my.
Brows now my eyebrows are one set that.
Actually does drastically change for my.
Life super glam routines my everyday.
Makeup routine usually you guys know i.
Would go into my anasazi on dipbrow but.
Today i'm using my benefit processing my.
Brow pencil in the shade number five to.
Slay these brows i'm gonna start off by.
Just lightly a combing through the hairs.
And brushing them upwards in the.
Direction that i want them to go as you.
Guys can see i already have a super.
Thick natural brow so i'm just gonna.
Start off by kind of sketching in the.
Tail because my brow kind of stops.
Abruptly here and i want to make sure.
There's at least some divine.
And that's kind of the only thing i.
Really like to find so after that i'm.
Just going to go through and i'm going.
To create a little hair like strokes.
Just to kind of build up that shape a.
Little bit in any areas that are more.
Sparse then if there's ever area where i.
Like to heavier made a mistake i'll just.
Go on with the spoolie on the other end.
And i'll kind of just brush through that.
To kind of erase and blend it in a.
Little bit as you guys can see this is.
Much later than my normal pretty heavy.
Brows and it also is a lot quicker so.
This is just a routine you like to do.
I'm next enter grab just a little bit of.
My ape tape concealer on my morphe 49m.
Begin to its sketch out underneath that.
Brow i left a little bit of a sparse.
Area right up in here so i'm just gonna.
Add a few more little alliance with that.
Benefit pencil and then to finish off.
The brows i'm gonna go to the maya.
Benefit gimme brow gel in the shade.
Number five and just brush those hairs.
Upwards to kind of create that bushy but.
Still natural brow effect now you guys.
Could totally stop here if you wanted to.
Pop on your favorite mascara highlighter.
And some chapstick and just walk out the.
Door but you guys know me even for my.
Everyday glam i still got to be a little.
Bit extra so for my eyes today i'm using.
The brand new limited edition of morphia.
Bronze mocha paola.
I'm her - of this did already sell out.
Unfortunately but a lot of you guys have.
Been messaging me asked me to do a.
Tutorial on this so i'm going to use it.
Today if you don't have this the 35k.
Also from morphe is a wonderful.
Alternative with similar shades first.
I'm gonna have this neutral toned orange.
Shade on my m4 for one and use that in.
My crease as a transition shade and then.
On an m4 33 i'm going to grab this cool.
Toned brown shade to it below the orange.
We use before and i'm going to deepen up.
The outer v and then if i am 514 i'm.
Going to go out this dark brown shade or.
Right in the bottom row and i'm going to.
Deepen out a little bit more.
Music.
And i'm not gonna grab my m4 for one.
That i started off with and just go over.
These shades make sure they are nice and.
Blended out i'm gonna add a quick way.
Using my la girl line our matte liquid.
Liner oh my god i have a huge pimple.
Over the top of my wings usually end so.
This is making things very very.
Challenging today and this la girl liner.
Is sucking for me i don't even know how.
I'm going to address this situation.
Anyway essentially not that deep i need.
To go to bed soon because i have school.
Tomorrow so i'm just gonna move on with.
Lower lashline i wonder got my m4 33 and.
The same orange shade from before insert.
That lower transition shade and grab me.
The medium brown once again on my m5 14.
I'm gonna blend and darken the outer.
Corner and then with my two 13 and they.
Dark brown shade that i use from before.
I'm going to really lightly hug the.
Lower lash line and the last i'm gonna.
Use my occ pencil in the shade of.
Feather to open up my eyes to make them.
Look super bright you know those days.
Are you like doing your makeup and.
Literally everything is going wrong.
That's what's happening to me right now.
My liner got messed up then i try to.
Line my upper waterline and my contact.
Got black on it and then i had to take.
It out then i was crying then i had to.
Wait my foundation off it has been a.
Night to say the least.
But i pulled everything back together.
Wiped my tears put on some translucent.
Powder and we're gonna keep moving on.
Because i don't have the energy to.
Refill this video or mascara today i'm.
Gonna be using my benefit roller lash.
Last today i'm gonna pop on my new phase.
The house of lashes ikonics.
If you would stop earlier on and didn't.
Do eyeshadow or liner but still want a.
Little bit of drama with your lashes i.
Would totally recommend the lily lashes.
In the style of miami there another one.
Of my absolute fave shocking would have.
An issue an inner corner wants to fly up.
Can one thing go right today one thing.
That's all i ask.
One thing god oh my god oh my god oh my.
God the lash is freaking on the fact.
That i am this excited about an eyelash.
Go out on the first try i should just.
Put you into your perspective how crappy.
This makeup day has been so far so line.
The upper waterline again since i.
Already cried it all off i'm going to.
Use the nyx jumbo eye pencil in a black.
Bean i'll write my next up is gonna be.
To add some fake freckles just in the.
Nose and cheek region you guys know me.
And you know that this is what my.
Favorite things to add to an everyday.
Makeup look and then my beauty blender.
I'm just going to go over those freckles.
To it literally blend them into at the.
Skin since this is everyday glam i feel.
Like we need to make up what we were.
Lacking in eyeshadow lips all the fancy.
Fun stuff with highlighter to get the.
Glow on today i'm going to use my morphe.
501 as usual and the oprah highlighter.
In the shade blissful remember you can.
Use kota james for 30% off all over.
Products girl oh wow.
Suddenly i'm blind i'm just probably.
This on the top of my cheeks as always.
And i also like to pop it right above my.
Brow bone when i do more unnatural glowy.
Looks welcome back i know it's been only.
A second for you guys but it's been an.
Hour for me because my camera just died.
Literally at this point what else can go.
Wrong just throw it at me because at.
This point i'm ready anyways to finish.
Off this look finally i'm gonna go to my.
Kat von d a bow and arrow liquid.
Lipstick this is my all-time favorite.
Nude shade i always wear it when i do.
Like light makeup looks and you guys.
Always ask it stays on all day i would.
Definitely recommend.
Music.
Holy crap i think that was the fastest.
I've ever done my lips in my entire life.
And we're gonna finish this look with.
The urban decay all nighter setting.
Spray after all the mistakes we made.
Today i never ever at once makeup to.
