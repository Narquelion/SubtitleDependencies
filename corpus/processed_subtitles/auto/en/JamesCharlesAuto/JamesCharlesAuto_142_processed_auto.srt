Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel so.
Now the halloween is officially over and.
We are on to november that means it is.
Officially holiday season i am so so.
Excited because the following winter.
Time is by far my favorite time at the.
Entire year this is the only time that i.
Am slightly missing upstate new york but.
I'm happy in la i love a good breeze all.
The leaves falling from the trees and of.
Course all the pumpkin spice latte.
Things but most of all all the makeup.
Brands out there holiday collections as.
Many of you guys know i'm currently.
Doing a sister upload week where i'm.
Uploading one video every single day for.
An entire week we started this past.
Saturday so make sure to check out the.
Previous videos if you have not seen.
Them yet and we have plenty of fun.
Videos coming soon as well that you will.
Have to say too and for but for today's.
Video i'm so pumped because i am gonna.
Showing you guys the brand new morphe.
Holiday collection you guys know i love.
Morphe so much i literally like one of.
Them all the time and even have my.
Coupon code for them on one of my.
Hoodie's but i really do love them as.
Both a brand and their products i think.
They're really really great and this is.
More b's first ever big big launch like.
This and i had the absolute honor of.
Being able to actually model for the.
Collection and it was so so much fun so.
Without further ado if you want to see.
All the new holiday items and how i.
Created this eyeshadow look today using.
The brady with 39a palette make sure you.
Keep on watching so a few days ago i got.
A rather large package sent to my.
Doorstep and when i opened it up it came.
With this then it literally cannot even.
Fit fully on the camera but this is the.
Pr package the morphe holiday collection.
Came in before we even get into the.
Actual products let's talk about this.
Freaking packaging because this is.
Absolutely stunning a lot of people.
Complained in the past about more v's.
Packaging being very very cheap looking.
And i do not think that that argument is.
If i want to make it all anymore there.
Are new stuff and new design and.
Products look so so good i've been so so.
Proud to watch them grow from the.
Beginning to where they are now it is.
Truly so exciting okay so looking at.
This entire collection in front of me.
There are a lot of things you have more.
People's definitely not playing around.
They said girl your stockings are going.
To be stuffed let's go to knock out the.
Brush collections first so the first.
Thing i want to show you guys is the i.
Still a six piece brushed collection now.
Before we even talk about the actual.
Brushes inside once again the name.
Isolates so good the packaging off.
Stunning so opening us up you get six.
Different brushes for doing your.
Eyeshadow with and also a cute little.
Gold bag to store them all in i do not.
Even know this is a part of the.
Collection so cute you definitely have a.
Lot to talk about here so i'm just gonna.
Go through these drawers there quickly.
But there is a tiny brush for doing.
Winged liner a pencil brush which you.
Guys know i always love to do for.
Highlighting my nose.
But in our chorus my brow bones or any.
Detail work on the eyes of course a flat.
Top concealer brush for any cleanup work.
I love using one of these to clean up.
Underneath my brows or sometimes my.
Winged liner or even my lip line if it's.
Looking a little bit wonky we have a.
Fluffy packer brush which is perfect for.
Packing on any eyeshadow to the lid then.
Of course a fluffy blending brush whoo.
That's a mouthful right there this will.
Be perfect for applying shadow into the.
Crease and on the eyelid and then of.
Course blending it out as well and then.
Of course a fluffy synthetic brush i.
Absolutely love using these for when it.
Comes to like blending work that needs.
To be done a little bit more soft that.
Makes sense for instance like blending.
Out a nose contour or blending out a.
Shadow that's already applied like with.
No product on it or i also use one of.
These for blending out my eyelid primer.
All the time so that is the ice layer.
Brush collection like i said it is a six.
Piece collection i'm gonna put the price.
Of it right down here so you guys can.
See it because i don't know the prices.
Off the top of my head i think it.
Definitely has every different type of.
Brush that you would ever need to start.
Off and i sort of look so thinks it.
Would be a really really great look for.
Beginners so the next brush that is.
Called complexion goals in one skin the.
Packaging is so beyond beautiful and.
This a five piece brush collection and.
Based on the name and the size of this.
Box i'm assuming this one is going to be.
For skin and complexion style brushes.
Okay so opening this up once again we.
Get a cute little brush case and then of.
Course we have the five brushes that the.
Complexion collection comes with so.
Starting off in the order that i would.
Use them in we first have a flat top.
Kabuki brush physically perfect for.
Blending in your foundation and it is so.
So soft next we have a fluffy a rounded.
Brush and i would use this to set my.
Face in place using a translucent.
Setting powder.
Nice to have this a fluffy angle brush.
And i would use this to contour so i put.
It right here just has all my cheekbones.
Of course we have two snaps a jawline.
And the forehead as well so after i.
Contour you guys know that i like to.
Lightly bake my face a little bit after.
Baking i would go into this next fluffy.
Tapered rounded blending brush whoa and.
Use this to a whiteboy the baked or.
Deepen up my contours a little bit and.
Lastly finally not least we have of.
Course the classic fan brush which.
Everybody uses to highlight.
Get that blinding glow all right guys.
That is the complexion of goals brush.
Collection all complete like i said it.
Is day five piece of brush - and i'll.
Put the price right down here i think.
This is once again a really great set.
For any beginner who likes to focus on.
Their skin i know my skin used to be a.
Really really big problem spot.
Especially when it came to my makeup and.
I've been working so hard on it and it's.
Finally in a place that i'm like.
Relatively happy with so i would.
Definitely recommend this brush that to.
Anybody who wants to really have that.
Slate it's matched porcelain face tuned.
In real life looking skin alright so.
Last but certainly not least brush.
Clicks that i want to tell you guys.
About today is the bling it on brush.
Collection opening this case up you get.
Once again a cute little storage thing.
And this is more of like a rose gold.
Envelope i think it is so cute and then.
Opening this up you fold this little.
Slope up and you get little individual.
Compartments for all your brushes so you.
Can keep them super neat and organized.
So this right here is a seven piece of.
Brush collection it comes with three.
Different face brushes and four.
Different eye brushes and these retail.
For a whopping $79 i know that price tag.
Is definitely a really really high it.
But these are definitely a collector's.
Item these are rolls called brushes and.
Then they have the cute little crystal.
With jeweled handles they are absolutely.
Stunning.
These are definitely gonna be a.
Collector's item i would not recommend.
These for the everyday and makeup wear.
These are gonna be a really really great.
Gift for anybody that really really.
Loves makeup and the beauty world i know.
That i personally will never use these.
They'll be displayed proudly right next.
To my diamond brush collection for more.
Free launched a few months ago these.
Will be a really really great gift for.
Anybody that absolutely loves the makeup.
World alright so those are all the brush.
Collections all complete but before we.
Move on to the eyeshadow today which i.
Am so pumped for i do want to show you.
Guys two other sets that came out with.
This holiday collection those being the.
Weapons of mass seduction sets literally.
Once again the names so good we have.
Pure nude and deep smoky and these are.
Basically five piece sets they've come.
With is that as you can see those are.
They black gel liner a black eyeliner.
Pencil a smudger fluffy brush and a tiny.
Detailed smudger brush and of course.
This little trio of eyeshadow colors.
Right here a black brown and many more.
Bronze e copper shade then the same.
Exact thing comes in the set pure nude.
But this is the eyeshadow trio comes.
With instead and is like a brownie.
Cranberry shade a light pink shade and.
Then a light orange shade perfect for a.
More natural everyday on-the-go.
Eyeshadow look i think these scents are.
Gonna be perfect for anybody who was.
Born.
It's makeup or a beginner it's literally.
$15 for a five piece set of everything.
You could possibly need for either a.
Smoky eye or a more natural all right.
Finally we get to open to the eyeshadow.
Which is what i know all of you guys.
Have been waiting for and i'm so pumped.
For before we actually get into the main.
Star of the show though we have two.
Smaller palettes being the night master.
And the day it's layer so this is the.
Base layer palette it comes with 15.
Different shades and retails for $15 so.
Definitely super super cheap it has a.
Mirror at the top as well which a lot of.
Morphe problems that don't have so thank.
God they out of this it is so incredibly.
Helpful that you can do your makeup on.
The go and this palette comes with a lot.
Of warm tone shade such as oranges than.
The classic browns and then we even have.
Any more like ready burnt shade to put.
On top of the lid definitely a beautiful.
Mix of mattes and metallics and i think.
This one is kind of comparable to the 35.
Oh just a fewer shades for a more.
Concentrated look obviously not.
Everybody can carry around some huge ass.
Palette with them so i think this is a.
Really really great palette for travel.
And then just like the dates later we.
Have the night master palette once again.
This one is $15 for 15 shades and this.
Palette is more a cool tone with like.
Browns still a few orangie tones up and.
Here but also the more purpley cranberry.
Tones for a more night on the town a.
Type of look finally the palette that.
I've been so excited to tell you about.
Is the 39a which is the dare to create.
Palette so this is the 30 on a right.
Here and if you'll notice it is much.
Bigger than the typical morphe palette.
That's because if you open it up this is.
What you have inside most morphe palette.
Retail for $22 and have seven rows of.
Five-minute oh five rows of seven.
Shadows that's right and this pot is.
Definitely a lot different than the.
Typical morphe palette this one retails.
For $32 and it comes with 39 shades.
Instead of 35 but as you'll notice the.
Middle row of this palette is all bigger.
Than the average pen size and these are.
All transition shades i think this.
Polly's absolute do this because not.
Only are there literally seven different.
Transition shades for seven different.
Skin tones or seven different looks the.
Pan sizes are also a lot bigger because.
Y'all know as soon as you get that.
Palette that you really really love the.
First shade you're gonna hit pan on is.
It transition shade because you use it.
All the time trust me it happens to me.
All the time so i think it is so smart.
To make the transition shades bigger so.
You never pan on them and you can use.
Them and love them forever without.
Further adieu i'm exhausted at talking.
At this point y'all are probably getting.
Tired of hearing my voice so let's are.
Playing with these shadows so first.
Program in the shader to find me on the.
Light fluffy brush from the ice lay a.
Brush kit and putting that in at my.
Crease as a transition shade i'm just.
Putting this shade all over my crease to.
Get a light wash of color on there to.
Prepare for all the shadows coming soon.
I'm not gonna grab the shade of vivid on.
That flat pack or brush on the same.
Brush set and use this too to find out.
The crease a little bit more i'm gonna.
Do a little bit of a halo eyes today so.
When it comes to the crease i'm keeping.
It pretty rounded and when i get to the.
Outer corner i'm not pulling it out and.
Winging it as much as i usually do you.
Guys know that i love doing that so this.
Is pretty hard for me but i think the.
Rounded i steep is gonna be beautiful.
For today's look next under grab at 514.
Brush and dip into the shades passion.
And vibrant and just mix them together.
To deepen up the crease a little bit.
Next time to grab that flat packer brush.
That once again i use to to find the.
Crease and grab the shade thick goal and.
Start to pack that on the lid i can.
Honestly say i think it has been a month.
Since i've lost use green eyeshadow i.
Don't really light the color green but.
These clubs in this palette are so.
Beautiful and it is perfect for holiday.
Season so i figured i would suck it up.
And create a bomb-ass slang camo green.
Look today just for you guys i cannot.
Even tell you how good it feels to be.
Able to open a morphe palette and use a.
Mirror inside of it to blend my.
Eyeshadow today just because i've.
Modeled before this collection does not.
Mean i can't throw a little bit of shade.
At my favorite brand this should have.
Been done a lot sooner and i'm so glad.
They finally did it once that's all.
Blended out and i'm happy with where the.
Green is i'm gonna go to the other side.
Of that flat packer brush and dip into.
The shade so glam it is like this bronzy.
Antique greeny gold type of color it is.
So beautiful and i'll grab a little bit.
Of my morphe setting spray and i'm going.
To spritz the brush just to get it nice.
And damp so the color is super pigmented.
And then i'm just gonna pack this right.
On the center of the lid that's.
Beautiful i'm next i take the pencil.
Brush on the ice like it and i'm gonna.
Dip into the shade pine and i'm going to.
Use this to blend out the edges and.
Deepen up the inner and outer corner of.
This halo eye this pie and show you.
Deftly does have a little bit of kick.
Back so make sure to top off your brush.
Before you apply it or else you might be.
Looking a little crazy and then just for.
A little bit more vibrancy i'm gonna dip.
Into the shade muse which is a block for.
The palate once again so glad we're.
Finally adding blocks with our palettes.
I always love a little bit of block to.
Define and just be everything a little.
Bit more deep and then back into that.
Original fluffy brush that we use for.
The transition shade.
For one final pop on the island before.
We move on to the lower lash line i want.
To show you guys saying that i am so.
Excited about and that is the master of.
Metallic sad so these are here are the.
Master of metallics and these are cream.
Eyeshadows and these are probably my.
Favorite item out of this entire.
Collection aside from the 39a palette of.
Course this set of three cream.
Eyeshadows comes for $12 meaning there.
Are four dollars each and these are so.
Beyond beautiful so comes with the shade.
Gold bronze and copper oh my god and my.
Opinion they're pretty comparable to the.
Steel at liquid metals they're.
Definitely not as like a glittery but.
They're really really beautiful and.
Metallic and shiny and this is the only.
$12 for a set of three meaning there are.
Four dollars each you guys you have to.
Get these that i really really hope that.
More he comes out with more of these.
Soon because i definitely will be.
Needing a lot more colors for today's.
I'm going to take a little bit of the.
Shade of gold and pop that right on the.
Center of my lid oh my god that is so.
Pretty then before choice that i'm just.
Gonna take my pencil brush to make sure.
The edges are nice and blended out so.
Lesson learned these definitely dry down.
Really really fast which is definitely.
Not a bad thing but if you're gonna be.
Playing with these just be careful work.
In small sections and blend fast because.
This looks so bomb by the way speaking.
Of fast dry down times as well you're.
Kidding.
So now that the top foot is all done.
Let's go in with the lower lash line and.
The first thing i got that fluffy brush.
Once again from the ice light collection.
And dip into the shade it defined me.
Just for a light wash the color for the.
Smooth blend on the lower lash and then.
Using an adam 514 with a shade of.
Passion and deepening that up a little.
Bit and then placing the shade a fickle.
On the inner and outer corner using that.
Pencil brush once you're gonna give me a.
Little bit of muse on a tiny liner brush.
And i'm going to place that right on the.
Inner and outer corners just for a.
Little bit more definition and then just.
Putting a little dollop of the gold.
Cream shadow right in the center so next.
We have two more kits from this.
Collection both beating to draw.
Attention sets they come in neutral and.
Bold and these are both sets of 10.
Different eyeliner pencils it has $19.
Each for 10 pencils per kit and this is.
What they look like and for today's line.
I'm gonna grab the shade coconut oh.
Looks today so i'm gonna grab the shade.
Coconut and i'm gonna use this to line.
Up my lower waterline for last day i'm.
Gonna quickly pop on a pair of house.
Lasha psychotics once again thank god.
For this mirror situation it is.
Literally a holiday miracle alright guys.
And that is one holiday i'll complete.
I'm gonna do the other one off camera.
Quickly to save some time and i'll be.
Right back to finish out the rest my.
Face and the collection alright guys.
Those are both holiday eyes all complete.
I just went ahead and i quickly did my.
Highlight off cameras we get that.
Natural glow and now to move on to the.
Lipid ii doodahs there are actually a.
Ton of lips launched with this.
Collection the first two items being.
These two lip kits being painted the.
Town nude and paint the town red.
Both retailing for $12 each with three.

Also this bronzy shade called luster.
This beautiful bright gold shade is.
Called goldy this shade called.
Reflection is the very like muted.
Purpley mavi color but on camera it's.

Then we have the shade sleek which is.
Once again a more a red metallic shade.
And this is it next to spotlight as you.
Can see it's a little more purpley and a.
