Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel for.
Today's video i am very excited because.
We are doing something that we have not.
Done in quite a long time but i love to.
Do and that is a makeup challenge.
Now this particular challenge has been.
Requested non-stop in my comments with.
Lost several videos in a row and i've.
Actually wanted to do this for so long.
So i'm very very excited and this is.
What i think i'm going to call it the.
Led lights challenge now you're probably.
Wondering james what the heck are you.
Talking about and don't worry i'm gonna.
Explain it to you right now it is a huge.
Trend for people to buy led at little.
Light trips and put them at the top of.
Their rooms for cool fun lighting.
Effects and also tik-tok transitions.
Now speaking of tick-tock this actually.
Became a trend octave talked a few weeks.
Ago where basically people were changing.
The color of their lights and doing.
Their makeup in a specific color now.
This may not seem too difficult because.
We all have our everyday makeup products.
That we know and love abut where it gets.
Very difficult is the eyeshadow portion.
I want to show you guys a quick example.
Because a lot of people were actually.
Using my palette for this challenge.
Because there are 39 beautiful rainbow.
Colors but when you turn on your led.
Lights like this it's not so very blue.
Anymore and now they all look the exact.
Same so for this challenge today i'm not.
Beneath my palette because i have it.
Memorized i'm gonna pick up a random.
Colorful palette from my makeup.
Collection and i'm gonna try my best to.
Do my full face of makeup and a.
Beautiful eye shadow look using only a.
Colorful led lighting and at the end of.
This video you and i will find out.
Together how actually turns out let's.
Get started.
Music.
Okay you guys i just want to talk about.
Right not only because i'm excited but.
Also because this is really hurting my.
Eyes and like messing up my overall.
Vision like i said in the beginning the.
Face person is probably gonna be pretty.
Easy so i'm just gonna speed through.
That but let's go ahead and get started.
I am first going to color correct using.
My bright green dragon beauty color.
Corrector i'm gonna put it on my beard.
Area this looks so crazy and this.
Lighting holy crop and quite let's go.
Ahead and blend this end just bringing.
The excess underneath the eyes or some.
Nice dark circle coverage now for a.
Foundation i'm gonna mix together my.
Noble two which is the dior air flash.
And fenty pro filter in the shade at 150.
Foundation matching is already hard for.
Me in a normal lighting so this lighting.
Should be a very interesting i know.
These two colors mix very well to make.
My skin tone but i'm not really sure.
What this looks like i'm just gonna.
Blend it in using my beauty sponge as.
Always i mean i have no idea if my.
Foundations like well this is actually.
Harder than i even thought.
Well concealer i'm just gonna grab my.
Shape tape it in the shade light just.
Gonna put this in my normal high points.
Of my face so nigh use the wrong shade.
No no this is tripping me out okay i'm.
Gonna blend it in i'm just going to set.
This with powder like always using the.
Other side of my sponge pressing it in.
There to lock it it kind of contours.
Always easing my anasazi up beverly.
Hills contour kits i do know where the.
Actual colors are on this palette and i.
Know that i always use this middle one.
But i don't think i can't really tell.
How intense this is gonna look i just.
Think my normal skin oh no i'm simon.
Well i'm actually getting nervous about.
This okay and i'm just going to contour.
My nose as well this might get bad fast.
I'm gonna come out of here and have like.
The harshest nose contour of our weight.
It literally looks like there's nothing.
There but i'm also scared of it packing.
It on there and then turning the light.
Back on and looking insane so i'm like.
Trying to tread lightly here and be.
Careful don't do contour my forehead.
Yeah i did not bronze thought that i did.
Not do okay so lately bronzing a little.
Bit of blush using the kylie cosmetics.
Pink dreams which looks bright yellow.
Music.
Look oh my god this is so insane what.
The hatch we try to change the color and.
See if it looks different like a.
Different color i'm sure it will right.
Let's let's try it.
Whoa oh here i can dip my nose contour.
Is definitely there i can see that oh oh.
I can see the colors a little bit easier.
In the blue everything good sneeze we.
Come stand in here and see if it looks.
Slow hmm oh i took a block light.
Oh whoa it's like a block like that when.
You're like investigating a crime scene.
You're looking for hidden specimens okay.
Well now looking in this light i can.
Tell my contour is a little harsh.
Oh holy crap.
For brows otis could use my anasazi.
Eyebrow powder and the shade and medium.
Brown and i'm just gonna clean my brows.
Up using a little bit of concealer and a.
Flat top brush i think this is good it.
Was definitely harder than i thought but.
I think if we flicked the lights back on.
Right now it would look okay that being.
Said we're about to move into the eye.
Shadow portion and this is where it gets.
A very very difficult i would love to.
Say in this blue lighting because it.
Hurts my head a lot less and i can.
Actually see a little bit of colors but.
This is a makeup challenge.
I don't want the speed too easy so let's.
Go ahead and flip the led lights you.
Look at my skin yeah ah oh that is a.
Harsh contour oh my god did i really.
Contour things that harsh princess fiona.
For this videos today i'm going to use.
The stacey at marie xb perfect cosmetics.
Carnival palette because in normal.
Lighting this is a very very beautiful.
And pigmented or rainbow palette similar.
To mine but i don't have any of the.
Color positions memorized at all so the.
Finished result will be colorful could.
Be good it could be bad on but we're not.
Gonna find out until then so let's jump.
In since we are focus on the eyes for.
This challenge i do think it would be.
Fun it also might really come back to.
Bite me in the butt to do one eye in the.
Green lighting and a certain color.
Combination and then switch the lighting.
And do a different color combination in.
A different color and then in the end.
When we turned the normal light back on.
And see which i actually like looks.
Better and it's like a better color.
Situation but i have plans to go out to.
Dinner with my friends after this and.
Being in public might not be a good idea.
So i'm going to of course prime my lids.
Using a little bit of concealer and i'm.
Gonna do my left eye first i'm first.
Gonna grab a four five six brush which.
Is my custom brush that i created with.
Morphia let's go james for 10% off and.
Let's do.
To the shade no no idea okay let's do.
Her suasion i don't know what this color.
Is.
But it looks like it's a lighter color.
Than a lot of the other ones so at least.
That means we'll be able to like put it.
In the right place so i'm gonna grab.
Persuasion and i'm gonna use this brush.
That i'm gonna start patting it in my.
Outer corner in a nice little v-shape.
And now i'm gonna grab a and 4-3-3 brush.
And let's dip into the color show boat.
I'm gonna use show boat to blend out.
Persuasion i'm gonna next gonna have.
Another m 4-3-3 brush and dip into the.
Shade called the height and i was gonna.
Put this in my inner corner and blending.
Those together in person the blend of.
This looks really really beautiful and.
On camera it looks no it looks okay.
Still but it could look better this is.
Actually really fun i'm sure i say that.
Now until i turn the lights back on and.
I look like i got hit by a bus now gonna.
Grab a little bit more of persuasion on.
My own four five six brush i'm going to.
Tuck this underneath my lash line like.
This and no grabbing some of showboat on.
My other brush and buffing that color.
Out so now that that is there so there's.
This color in this palette.
It's called ecstasy and it's looking.
Like it is lime-green and i'm gonna grab.
Ecstasy on a pencil brush and i'm going.
To press this in my inner corner for a.
Nice vivid hop the fact that it's not.
Even showing up on my skin it makes me.
Think that it probably is actually a.
Neon green color and i'm just going to.
Cut my crease using a little bit of a.
Concealer and a flat top brush i'm gonna.
Get the shade of peppermint and i'm.
Gonna give it a nice spread of some.
Prepping setting spray and then i'm.
Going to pack this on the lid carefully.
Packing this color on there making sure.
Not to mess up my cut crease and i'm.
Also gonna take the color.
Backchecked so i'm going to put this.
Particular color on the lid as well in.
This like outer area and that was my.
Same m 4 or 5 6 brush before diving a.
Little bit more of persuasion i'm just.
Going to top this over the edge and make.
Sure it is nice.
Blended out alright so i think that is.
Pretty much one i all complete i have no.
Idea what that's gonna look like i'm.
Gonna add of course lashes and mascara.
After but for now let's go ahead and.
Switch the lighting one more time and.
Move on to the other eye and see what we.
Can come up with oh no oh god what the.
Heck what is what i do i look like i.
Have a black eye this is it looks so.
Normal and the right thing oh my god.
This is so bad.
Well we have nothing to lose now so.
We're just gonna go ahead a primus other.
Eyelid so i definitely need some of the.
Colors in the palette that we didn't use.
It the last time so this time i'm gonna.
Grab the shade.
Let's try covering the shade of wasted.
In this lighting the shade looks like a.
Light purple so grabbing the shade of.
Wasted i won't say another m 4 5 6 brush.
And putting this in the outer area and.
Topping this m okay i'm just putting us.
In the same type of motion and lightly.
Blending out the edges as we go next i'm.
Gonna grab the shade in lust i don't.
Know this is gonna be what we're gonna.
Try to blend out wasted using this color.
Don't be shy put some more ok blending.
This out now with another m 4 5 6 brush.
Let's grab the color lips because our.
Mmhmm yeah let's go the color left.
Because it is right next to endless.
Sometime i think this is gonna be nice.
And warm tone as opposed to whatever we.
Have going on over here.
Blend it down to the lower lash line as.
Well for the public art on this eye i'm.
Gonna grab the shade called pepti in the.
Bottom of the palette so we're gonna cut.
Our crease once again okay once you're.
Gonna grab me another flat brush i'm.
Gonna dip into let's do the shade of.
Pink me i know for a fact this one's.
Gonna be pink because of the name so.
Thank you stacy for that one and we're.
Gonna put this one all over the lid up.
Just like we did with our last color.
Keeping it nice and light for the outer.
Portion i'm gonna get a little bit of.
The shade at temptation i'm gonna put.
This to blend together that pink talked.
And wasted color alright you guys so.
That is the shadow portion of both eyes.
All complete i'm horrified because this.
Eye it looked a lot like this i did.
Before we switch the lighting so i don't.
Know what's gonna happen when we change.
The color next but before we do that i'm.
Gonna go ahead and apply it lashes and.
Mascara and then we.
We'll finish off this long alright you.
Guys we are back i popped on lashes and.
Mascara thank god the only color.
Involved with those are black so no.
Surprises there so let's go ahead and do.
A highlighter i'm just gonna grab my.
Highlighting brush and the b probe it.
Tells that i thought about actually has.
Highlighters in it so i'm just gonna go.
This top one because it looks like it's.
The lightest and let's go ahead and just.
Pop this on look at all the top of the.
Brows it's always a little bit on the.
Chin and then my nose highlight as well.
Okay so our last and final step is going.
To be at the lips and i could just go.
Ahead and grab a nude lip that i have on.
My desk because i use them all the time.
But this is already a mess okay let's be.
Real said to get more fun to reach into.
My lipstick drawer and just pick out a.
Random color and see what ends up.
Happening once again alright so i went.
Ahead and i picked at this one from.
Kylie cosmetics i have not looked at the.
Actual name but i picked this color.
Because it looked a little bit different.
Tone wise than a lot of the other.
Lipsticks that i knew were nudes in the.
Drawer so hopefully this will be.
Something fun that was saying that still.
Matches with the rest of the look.
Alright.
I think that is this look all complete.
I'm gonna go ahead give myself a quick.
Spritz of my morphia helping set setting.
Spray to really lock it in place and now.
It is time ladies and gentleman after a.
Very long and scary makeup application.
Process to turn off our led lights and.
Switch back to our normal beauty.
Lighting and see what the heck we have.
On our face are you guys ready one two.
Three i'm gonna look down first so my.
Eyes can adjust back to normal colors.
Okay okay oh wait a second this is cute.
Like not good not good but oh my god.
Wait a second what you know i just far.
As i'm wearing green lipstick i have a.
Nun green lipstick like that's cute.
I like none of this the skin doesn't.
Look that bad and this lip color was.
Definitely the worst decision out of all.
Of them otherwise you guys well i think.
That is this led lights makeup challenge.
All complete i had a so much fun filming.
This today despite the fact that it was.
Quite the emotional roller coaster all.
The way it through i went into this with.
Very very low expectations because i'm.
So used to my beautiful white lighting.
And i had a feeling that the colored.
Lighting was going to be very very.
Deceiving and oh boy was it in the end.
