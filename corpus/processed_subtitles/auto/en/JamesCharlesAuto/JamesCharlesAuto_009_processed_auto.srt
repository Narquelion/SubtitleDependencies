Long time now because i personally love.
Watching other people's daily life.
Videos i think they're super super.
Interesting and i really want to show.
You guys what like my daily work life.
Looks like obviously it's no secret that.
The whole point of these videos.
Is to make the audience think that your.
Day is like crazy i feel like you guys.

Point.
Like what am i gonna do okay film a day.
Of life anywhere i wake up at 10 in the.
Morning and go downstairs eat breakfast.
Postmates.
Three meals sell them a tick tock and go.
Back to bed no because it's boring i do.

Quickly and take a look at my calendar.

Sister's bathrobe on.
And now it's time to go ew did you hear.
That noise oh my god what does even.
Going on with this video.
It is no time to get ready for the day.
I'm just gonna put my phone that looks.
Like.
I didn't even put this if anybody ever.
Told me that i'd be hitting 20 million.
Subscribers i'd tell you that you're a.
Joke.
Don't forget to rush your timetable kids.
Okay so now that my teeth are nice and.
Minty fresh and beautiful i would.
Normally go ahead and take a.
Shower which you can see i desperately.

And then yeah all right you guys have.
All applied i know that i still look.
Really really busted but please.
Just give it a few more hours um i.
Decided not to go downstairs and.
Get started on today's video before.
Everything else has to get started.
Before that though i have to head over.
To finn's.
Food bowl and give him some food when he.
Comes downstairs um we have this like.
Weird.
Shaped food dish for him because he eats.
Really fast fun fact for you.
We got him some water as well.

Music.
Okay hi lewis hi luis good morning.
Now it is time to get started on my work.
Um i've been doing this for four years.
Now.
I'm so grateful to have an incredible.
Team around me that helps with all other.
Aspects of videos but for some reason.
I insist i'm doing the thumbnails still.
Every single time so.
I'm going to just head into google drive.
Go into the beauty battle and then we.
Took some thumbnails i always go ahead.
And look.
Through them i actually really like this.
One that's a little bit uncomfortable.
Um a lot of these are really smiley but.
I think this one was the one.
Yeah this feels like an actual battle so.
I'm gonna go ahead and download.
This one and then i'll show you guys my.
Thumbnail process.
I don't really do too much the.
Thumbnails to be honest i feel like some.
People like go crazy which is.
More power to them that's just never.
Been like our you know video style we.
Usually just do.
Plain white backgrounds not a lot of.
Text or emojis or anything so.
All right so i'm pretty sure that's done.
At this point like i said super.
Simplistic all i did was just brighten.
The colors desaturate the background do.
Some slight retouching on any blemishes.
Or.
Any reshaping that i like to do for my.
Head personally so that is pretty much.
My portion of the video process.
All complete oh good morning olden thank.
You so much.

Give it over to louis and he always does.

To the studio and i'm going to get glam.
For our instagram.
And a few more to talk photo shoots oh.
Nobody's in there okay i have my laptop.
With me because i want to watch a few.
Youtube videos that i missed for some.
Reason whenever i like get ready am i.
The only person like i cannot listen to.
Music i don't know why is anybody else.
That way like for some reason i just.
Can't focus i much prefer to listen to.
Like podcasts or youtube videos.
Which by the way literally everybody in.
My life is asking me to do podcast so.
That's something that you guys are.
Interested in.
Please let me know because i'm actually.
Definitely considering it so i'm going.
To watch a few different youtube videos.
Probably some minecraft stuff and.
Let's get ready are you going to film.
Like an actual video we can just.
Give you a good mirror too true oh my.
God i can't wait to show them the actual.
Studio.
On sneak peek you guys okay let's get.
Ready.
All right you guys i just finished my.
Glam process it is currently 509 p.m so.
I was down here for about an hour and a.
Half i watched some minecraft videos on.
Youtube catching up on my hermitcraft.
Series and now it is time to go upstairs.
I just did a fun little cute neutral.
Look for today just so i can film tech.
Talks and take photos in a few different.
Outfits but i am going to come back down.
Later on.
Tonight and add a pop of color to match.
My outfit for larry's party.
So let's go so that's why i feel like.
That works really well in the carousel.
I think you should do both though like i.
Think you should this moment though on.
The carousel with orange should make the.
Outfit look.
So much better um because i look good.
Like this.
Music.
So this is the first look for ig super.
Super cute and we're also going to pack.
The.
Next outfit that we showed earlier today.
And we're going to change in the car.
Because our photo location is apparently.
Right across the street according to mr.
Lewis who did the locations.
You look like you underdog so we're now.
Going to head downstairs into the car.
And go take some.
Music.
She said i'm a natural tan mama come on.
Trevor trevor said instagram boyfriend.
Okay.
Two bottoms do make a top oh god.
Oh that is cute wow the lighting is so.
Pretty here.
Look at that gorgeous smiling lady that.
Looks like chris jenner at 16.
Let's do a few more squattings i want to.
I want a little bit more i need more.
Side profile once like we got glasses.
Oh yeah that's the best.
We're getting changed in the middle of.
The road currently.
Oh.
Maybe we're going to cut the camera for.
This cut the camera we got into the new.
Outfit in.
The car which was alarming considering.
The amount of people that were staring.
At me the entire time and walking.
By see the problem is right now it looks.
Gorgeous but the sun.
Which is back here is not really like.
Out it's a very very cloudy day which is.
Definitely.
Good for some photography but not really.
For makeup photography.
So we're gonna try our best and see what.
We can come up with.
Give us an arch give us a big arch.
All right okay so we're back from the.
Photo shoot i just filmed three more.
Tick tocks and stockpiled for this week.
Which will be really good because we.
Have another busy week.
Up ahead with more filming stuff cassie.
Just got here ready for the party.
Tonight jesus is fully glam now i have.
To decide what i actually want to.
Wear and look like for the party i was.
Thinking about wearing this like offer.
That i haven't added a fun little like.
Pop of orange but i honestly feel like i.
Feel like i just like.
Need to do like natural which i honestly.
Love like i love that i've been.
Throwing less makeup and stuff so i'm.
Thinking that maybe like my more natural.
Moment should be just like a simple.
Outfit like sweat and a sweatshirt.
Instead of all this i don't know.
You guys this is the finished fit for.
Larry's party tonight he literally just.
Texted in the group shot saying that.
It's an all block party which.
Unfortunately eliminated my other outfit.
But kind of made me go like that anyway.
Which is.
Great i'm wearing an oversized black.
Blenciaga hoodie uh these biker swords.
Which are also blunts yaga but they're.
Fun fact.
Kids just regular shorts but i wear them.
As    shorts and i'm nice and tucked.
So you can't see anything don't worry.
And then just the jordan one pandas it.
Is currently about 7.
30. we have 30 minutes until we're going.
