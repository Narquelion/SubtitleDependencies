You my talks.
So my name is adam a lot of people think.
My actual name is elissa 20 years old it.
Was um december i posted my first video.
I was at home had ordered a lash from.
Some lash company on instagram and they.
Were so huge so i was like what can i do.
With these like i was like i said i love.
Makeup so i was gonna use them in a.
Creative way.
Uh-huh um but for the video i had put.
Them on there were a little my stuff so.
I was like hmm i came on my first video.
I didn't have a name for her wait the.
First for the first roast the video.
Wasn't even actually roasted i know oh.
Yeah my second video i had sat there and.
I was like i have to give her a name you.
Know she's kind of iconic she needs a.
Title she was the name right i sat there.
And i was like what is the good name you.
Know i need like something that's like.
Not too basic but basic yeah i was i.
Came to life and she changed my life.
Yeah she really did yeah it's like you.
Said you were 20 and before that you.
Were working a regular job right so.
Where are we even working before so i.
Was working at a cost in there oh and.
Like sometimes i don't have to bring.
That all side of me and like she is like.
Very like my alter ego so she's just.
Like kind of built inside me so you're.
From texas san antonio san antonio texas.
Okay i've never been to texas before him.
But i want to go so bad i love texas so.
Much since i could be lit there mm-hmm.
Ready for some fun see you later mm-hmm.
Okay so autumn i know we first started.
Talking a few what we can see oh you.
Tell me that you had just ended up.
Leaving at the call center job yes so i.
Hated that job it wasn't like my career.
Anything i wasn't gonna.
I didn't pan i'm saying they're right.
But yeah i kind of just took a leap of.
Faith and was like we just joe so how.
Has doing tic toc then change your life.
Because obviously it's way different.
Than what it wasn't assuming a few.
Months ago yeah so i think the craziest.
Part is getting recognized in public the.
Craziest and like the best part i feel.
Yeah i go to like my local store and i.
Get recognized and i'm like what like it.
Still hasn't sunk in and i have millions.
Of followers on that platform right cuz.
I i don't know i still i feel the same.
Exact same it's just i don't know i feel.
Like people expect me to like change in.
Some weird way i felt the exact same.
Well that's good it's good that like you.
Don't feel like anything is changing.
Because that means that you're a good.
Person on the inside and now this is.
Your first time in la.
Huh yeah so i had never even been out of.
Texas before what i've never been on a.
Plane never been down to texas i'm.
Telling you oh my gosh i was so like.
Boring yeah i had never been out of.
Texas my first time on a plane so yeah.
It's like being in la has been so crazy.
And there's just so many opportunities.
Ok so i want to know if you are a fan of.
Makeup what has been like your.
Experience with it in the past cuz you.
Only helped i think you only have like.
One tick tock or instagram photo op with.
Makeup on it's like green and pink.
Eyeshadow i'm using it in like my head.
For some reason i haven't been doing.
Makeup for long i recently got into it i.
Believe 2019 oh ok so only well sure.
Yeah.
And so i had i was obviously inspired by.
A lot of male makeup artists like you.
Manny i'm so many yeah and so i had.
Remember i had gotten paid one day and i.
Was like you know what i have no bills.
Like this cheque let me go and go to.
Alta and i spent almost $400 on like a.
Full face oh my god because i was like i.
Have to get enough stuff for like a full.
Face so i spent $400 and i went home and.
I hated all of it like no i applied.
Everything and i looked crazy so i was.
Like what did you do i spent $400 and.
Now i hate it all but then i just kept.
Trying i was again youtube videos i.
Ended up i wanted to get perfect my eyes.
For sure i underestimated the face part.
Of the makeup process i think everyone.
Does yeah everyone does it seems like.
It'd be so much easier but it's not.
It takes a long time but like really get.
Happy with your babies yeah let's go.
Ahead and start some contour and this.
Time we're gonna be a little bit less.
Harsh okay how do think roses makeup.
Aside from the eyelashes even from about.
Um so the way it did it i pretty much.
Took into consideration all the girls at.
The high school in shade no and it's so.
It's kind of like so unreal but it's.
Real because like you're not gonna walk.
Out in public and see some girl with.
That much fun while yo you may walk out.
And be like girl do you have that much.
Contour on you know anything yeah so.
It's kind of like that exaggerated look.
That i wanted to give her yeah she's.
Just that girl who just does the most.
With everything okay so then what was.
Like the first moment that you knew you.
Had like something good going on it was.
At one specific video that blew up yeah.
So my slushie video was everywhere i.
Think you got a dollar yeah you got a.
Dollar so i can go get a slushie that.
One for me kind of just it definitely.
Put us on the map she was on twitter on.
Facebook on instagram she was everywhere.
And that's what i was like i have to.
Continue to think like i'm sitting here.
I know and you're like you're here doing.
My face it's insane oh yeah like i don't.
Know i mean i have watched you for so.
Long why don't you know how you have.
That moment when you're like oh like.
This is like kind of crazy yeah i've had.
Like well i'm gonna day i've had a.
Couple of those but this one right now.
Is kind of like so surreal oh that is so.
Sweet thank you for saying that you have.
A really good nose for makeup really.
Yeah those two tiny look forward okay.
Adam one of course what i have for you.
Was you mentioned earlier how obviously.
Did not like the call center job and.
You're really excited to just get out.
And do all the stuff with rossa what do.
You want to do with her in the future or.
Like with you in the future i would love.
To just kind of expand on tik-tok since.
I was like my first platform that i kind.
Of grew on yeah i'm so thankful for it.
So i want to definitely grow on there.
Maybe i want to bring in my closest.
Family members her boyfriend oh yeah.
Just to grow on see my nose is gone can.
You even breathe let's do some.
Highlighting using of course the change.
House expert fiat mini palette we're.
Gonna use the shade of face to the side.
Yes alright you guys so that is pretty.
Much our base all complete we're gonna.
Go do the brows off-camera and i'll be.
Right back to start off the eye shadow.
Luck all right you guys we are back and.
Both brows are now complete and it is.
Now time we went to our eyes shadow so.
Adam what type of look do you want to do.
Today okay so i'm inspired by your shirt.
I want a blue bottle okay i found like a.
Blue black smokey eye my definitely okay.
Yeah okay okay let's do it let's grab.
That junior chose exmoor pig mini.
Palette let's go some color alright you.
Guys are gonna start off with an m four.
Five six and dipping into coma notice.
That's like a really popular on.
Tick-tock is a lot of craters posts like.
Literally like a few times a day whereas.
On your page you don't post nearly as.
Often as that but all of your videos go.
Viral.
So what is your thought process behind.
Like one you both your videos are not.
Yeah so i kind of just film i try and.
Post the one in video every week it's.
Just cuz i feel i don't want people to.
Think i'm kind of like trying to push.
Out a content that's not even good.
Anymore so that's kind of why i don't.
Post like so consistently just because i.
Feel like i want quality over quantity.
And yeah always like said that since the.
Beginning do you think that make up.
Stuff it's like something that you want.
To get more into especially on your.
Social media channels like coming up cuz.
Of which i would love to see some videos.
I would love to see some rum so makeup.
Videos to my sisters otis a year you got.
A dollar.
For sure i kind of wanna incorporate.
Both of me myself like adam yeah i know.
So like i don't know i just feel like i.
Can create something so good with both.
Of them yeah i had seen some comment.
That said you should do a contour and.
Highlight duo like pat oh yeah i was.
Like that's so iconic.
Oh alrighty nice that is pretty much the.
Ice not a person all complete we.
Literally just use the blue tones and it.
The palate it looks so good.
Do you like it it's so good.
Monochromatic moment alright you guys so.
We're gonna go ahead and mirror that i.
Said onto the other eye and then we'll.
Be right back to do the mascara and.
Lashes is that because i think rosa he's.
A little bit of a lesson alright you.
Guys so we're about the bolt eyes done.
And it is now lashes time which i am a.
So got excited more okay so i thought.
It'd be kind of fun because adam loves a.
Dramatic lash to actually use the lashes.
That we had on earlier put them on.
Correctly i won't know where the heck.
Did the whole wonky laugh situation even.
Start from like cuz it was kind of like.
That dramatic look like the    she.
Doesn't know what she's doing my kinda.
Like just getting out of the house ready.
To go she puts an eyelash upside down.
You know okay i noticed time for lip.
Liner starts gonna go in with a classic.
Nude lip oh my god it hey you alright.
Adam the last question that i want to.
Ask you while i'm about to set your face.
In place is how does it feel for you.
When you see other people making roasted.
Videos or like impersonating you because.
I feel like it's become such a huge part.
Of like the tic-tock culture at this.
Point yeah so i feel like the most joy.
That i gather this is seeing everybody.
Is so many people all around the world.
Create like their own version of it oh.
Sorry i just feel like it's so dope that.
I'm able to represent my community in.
This way like yeah it's literally gone.
