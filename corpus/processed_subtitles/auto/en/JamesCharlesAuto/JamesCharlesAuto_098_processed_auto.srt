Especially nowadays that are like i.
Can't believe never serious on that one.
Well especially like in like.
Pennsylvania if you're wearing a lot of.
Makeup that immediately makes you like.
Like if you went to school like that and.
Everything yeah you'd get called so many.
Names because that's just not normal in.
C when i was actually in high school i.
Think i only wore makeup to school twice.
I i mean either i never cared that yeah.
Oh i was i literally didn't wear because.
I was too lazy to yeah like when you.
Don't have any hair it's not like i can.
Do my hair up all night oh my god.
Speaking of it looks like on the.
Original video because obviously so.
Inspire them um i wrote i suffer from a.
Location just lost all my hair to the.
Condition i cried for hours because i.
Felt like my long hair to find my beauty.
I felt embarrassed to leave the house.
Without a wig makeup helps me walk out.
The door every day and still feel like a.
Queen without my hair it is a huge.
Stress relief doing my makeup in the.
Morning and feeling confident enough to.
Go out with my friends and be myself i.
Honestly would be hiding in my house if.
It weren't for makeup and amazing people.
Like you to make me feel beautiful i.
Love you james oh yeah i love that.
Confidence because like most people like.
Obviously that gets a very very heart.
Disease for a lot of people to do and.
Like truly does show like certain like.
Body parts or accessories like aren't.
Needed or that's what we're to put it.
But certain things are needed for video.
Yeah that's like staring septic you.
Don't need long flowy curly locks to be.
Beautiful like you don't need like a.
Beef ac beautiful either like i love it.
You're oh that's just in terms me so.
Much i'm so so freakin happy that you're.
Here when if you don't be asking when.
Were you diagnosed.
Alopecia is like yeah tell me about it.
Cuz i love it i'm just to be honest i.
Really i'm not familiar with it i never.
Really went to get diagnosed per se.
Because i was kind of like.
Barriss at the time especially when i.
First got it but i mean especially i.
Mean i've been told by my just family.
Doctor there's nothing else that it.
Could be right so i mean obviously.
That's what it is but um alopecia areata.
Is the type that i have which is just.
The way that it falls out is the second.
Part areata means it falls out in.
Circles or out your head okay about five.
Months ago now that is i was was when.
The first patch fell out so this was.
Recent though yeah okay and about three.
Months after that i decided to.
Completely shave my head for the first.
Time.
Lava yeah because i most of my hair had.
Already fallen out and i believe that.
There was just no point in keeping it.
For the rest of it because i mean i.
Thought i looked more like a goofball.
With like just three patches of hair and.
No hair at all no i rather just had no.
Hair at all yeah i was looking your.
Entry of the pictures when you were like.
Fully ball we're so funny i feel like it.

Definitely like i started doing makeup.
Right when all this started coming out.
That like you can set your face with.
Setting spray because like a new.
Freaking revelation there's so many like.
Makeup advances and trends if i don't.
Know where it all came at the exact same.
Time yeah well like i even remember it.
Like there is no such thing as primer.
When eyes are doing makeup oh.
Like i remember starting in like they're.
Only being like professionals around.
Even back you know and like i think 2015.
