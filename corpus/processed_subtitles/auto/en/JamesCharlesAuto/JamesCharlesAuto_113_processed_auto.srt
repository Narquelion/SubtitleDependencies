Music.
Hi.
Sisters james charles here and welcome.
To the official.
2020 house tour and also.
20 million subscriber special oh my god.
You guys i cannot believe today is.
Finally here and we are finally filming.
This video i am so beyond excited and i.
Know so many of you guys have been.
Waiting for it as well.
And here we are a few months ago i.
Revealed to you guys on my instagram.
That i actually purchased.
My first ever home which has been my.
Biggest dream since i was a little kid.
And it's been my number one goal since.
Actually starting in social media and it.
Is crazy that it became a reality we.
Actually purchased this home back in.
November of 2019 and have been.
Renovating for the past almost.
Nine months now and finally after.
Renovating decorating and getting.
Settled in i am finally ready to take.
You guys inside on the.
Full sisters house tour last and final.
Thing that i want to tell you guys.
Before i let you in.
Is that this is the 20 million.
Subscriber giveaway.
This home would not be possible if it.
Were not for you guys and i am so.
Incredibly grateful you will have to.
Watch all the way to the end.
To find out what the giveaway is but i.
Will tell you it is the absolute biggest.
Giveaway we have ever.
Done and i know that you guys are going.
To be super excited.
Come on in.
Music.
All right you guys come on in i'm so.
Excited to show you the entire house.
Obviously upon entering the front door.
We are in the nice lovely entryway.
And the first room that we have right.
Here on the left is the formal.
Living room.
Music.
If you guys remember the last house tour.
That we were in the vibe and like the.
Layout is honestly pretty similar.
But this house is like a trillion times.
Better and bigger so i'm so excited to.
Show you guys.
My favorite part about this entire.
Formal living room is of course the fin.
On the ground.
But also this beautiful chandelier that.
We have in the ceiling.
And also this stunning floor-to-ceiling.
Fireplace my friends and i are in here.
All the time singing together and having.
Little jam sessions.
Personally i cannot read music but as.
Long as you know how to play the.
Classics that's all that matters.
Coming out of the formal living room we.
Are of course back into it the entryway.
We just have this cute little circle.
Mirror and i love this detail that.
Literally looks like it's like heading.
From.
A pen obviously it's secure on the wall.
Because there's a lot of earthquakes.
Here in california but.
It's just perfect to check our face.
Before we go out of the house and run.
Any errands.
And then right around this way we have.
The formal.
Dining room now i say formal because.
Honestly the chances of us.
Using this room are virtually very very.
Slim if i'm.
Being real we never use the dining room.
Or the last house and.
Already just from moving in here about a.
Month ago the only purpose of this room.
Has been either meetings.
Or dumping packages that we get from the.
Mailbox we really eat in the kitchen.
Which you guys will see a lot in a.
Second.
Along this one we just have the storage.
Cabinet and then right above it is this.
Picture which if you guys have been.
Following me for a long time you may.
Have recognized this this is actually a.
Photo that i took myself on my senior.
Trip in school to south africa.
There's actually a few different photos.
From the trip around the house which you.
Guys will spot throughout the tour.
My amazing interior design team which.
We'll talk about in a second wanted to.
Make sure that there were personal.
Touches.
From me all throughout the house which i.
Just think is so so cool and really.
Important during interior design okay.
Now coming out of the.
Formal dining room if we keep walking.
Further into the home.
This next feature is the wine cellar now.
Wine cellars are pretty popular in newer.
Construction builds especially in the.
Area that i'm in in california.
But for somebody like me who doesn't.
Drink wine it's pretty pointless and if.
You guys remember the last house.
The wine cellar literally stayed empty.
For the entire year and a half that i.
Was living there so when we moved into.
This house i was like okay we have to.
Put something in there so at least.
Looks presentable so we decided to fill.
It with one of my favorite drinks.
Coca-cola all right you guys so directly.
Across from the wine or.
I guess coke seller is first of all the.
Stairs to the basement which will be.
Later on in the video i'm so excited to.
Show you and then we also have.
The formal office i'm obsessed with.
These beautiful glass.
French doors that open up into the.
Formal office.
Now personally for me i'm not a very.
Like formal office type person i.
Honestly would just take my laptop and.
Work anywhere.
Which you guys obviously know um but we.
Didn't want to have a cute little like.
Office space just for anybody who.
Doesn't need to use it for anybody on my.
Team.
And we also have my gaming set up here.
It has been like months since i've.
Played any games or streamed online i.
Low-key honestly missed games with james.
So if that's something you guys want to.
See come back let me know because it's.
All set up and ready to go so all right.
Now coming out of the office.
I am so excited to show you guys the.
Space that we probably use the absolute.
Most.
In this house it is such a massive.
Upgrade from the last place.
And that is of course the kitchen.
Honestly you guys when i walked into.
This house and saw the kitchen it was.
Almost like a guarantee in my heart that.
I needed to buy this house because the.
Kitchen.
Really is the heart of the home there.
Are two beautiful stunning marble.
Double islands we have these massive.
Pendant lights light gray cabinets with.
A lot of white features as well and i am.
Just absolutely in love.
With this space it is no secret that i.
Do not cook.
Okay i'm not hiding it i postmates.
Literally every single.
Meal but despite the fact that i do not.
Cook my friends and i are in the kitchen.
All the time eating sitting at the.
Island filming mooc bones together.
Talking gossiping and most importantly.
Just being with each other if i take you.
Guys back this way.
There's not much back here other than.
Just like i think this is called the.
Butler's.
Area of the house i'm not really sure to.
Be honest um we just have like the.
Coffee machine cups back here a little.
Mini fridge.
But i do want to show you the pantry.
Which is right over.
Here once again not much cooking but we.
Do do a.
Lot of snacking and i really want to.
Show you guys this because of how.
Beautiful and organized it is.
Thanks to reorganize a few weeks from.
Instagram stories i was talking about.
How we're moving into the house.
And i got a dm from somebody being like.
You need to get your house.
Professionally organized.
And i was like what does that even mean.
And i started doing research and.
Found out that there is literally people.
Whose job it is.
To organize your house and make it look.
Pretty and i was so excited i posted it.
On my stories rhea and her team reached.
Right out and they came.
Literally the next day and made the.
House look so beautiful.
This looks so good all thanks to her you.
Guys should definitely check her out.
Because she has saved my life okay so.
Right across from the kitchen we have.
One of my favorite places in the entire.
House which is the.
Living room.
This is pretty much like the relaxation.
Destination.
That little rhyme like i mentioned the.
Kitchen you guys know my friends and.
Family are here over all the time.
And in the living room it was really.
Important that we had a lot of different.
Seating spaces so we have these gorgeous.
Chairs from.
Craft house we have this massive sofa.
We're actually waiting to put another.
Like.
Chunk or like star.
Piece of the sofa and so we have here.
Before sitting space and then we have.
This gorgeous leather shades lounger.
Look at me being a furniture expert.
Right below the tv.
You know we are in here literally all.
The time as a family and friend watching.
Movies playing xbox sometimes chilling.
And honestly watching a lot of music.
Videos as well.
It's just like a full vibe in here while.
We're in one of my favorite rooms that i.
Feel like has really really good.
Decor i feel like it is only appropriate.
To give a shout out to the interior.
Design company that did.
The entire house from day one which is.
Leclaire decor.
Now brenda baby's home has been a really.
Stressful project but also a really.
Rewarding project.
And working with la claire de court was.
Definitely one of the most like.
Rewarding partnerships i have ever had.
I have nothing but like the absolute.
Best thing to say about them.
Um their entire design team sasha mel.
And then i worked directly with meredith.
Was.
Amazing from beginning to end they were.
Just on top of everything they were so.
Organized they actually cared so much i.
Truly felt like on the last day of the.
Project when they were placing the final.
Decor items and really fluffing the.
Pillows and they're getting ready to.
Leave i was like losing a piece of.
My family like they just took such good.
Care of me and if any of you guys want.
To check them out if you were moving.
Into a new house.
I would one billion percent recommend.
Leclaire decor for any of your amazing.
Design services.
They did such a good job clearly and.
This house would not look as beautiful.
As it does.
Without them all right you guys so.
There's only one area left of the main.
Floor that i want to show you and that.
Is the guest.
Bedroom now this is opposite of the.
Formal living room so.
The other way when you come in the front.
Door as we move past the mud room and.
The cute little ensuite bathroom.
We have the guest room of the house.
There are actually a lot of bedrooms.
When i first moved into this home but we.
Converted most of them into workspaces.
But it was definitely important that we.
Kept at least one being a guest room.
And that is this room i love the wood.
Tones and the blue tones it gives me.
Very like beachy type fives and since we.
Have friends and family over all the.
Time it is the perfect place for any of.
Our guests to.
Sleep also it coincidentally happens to.
Be the room that is furthest from my.
Bedroom.
So this is perfect for when the parents.
Come to visit nice and far away while.
We're on the subject of bedrooms it is.
Finally time for me to take you guys.
Up to the next level of the house i'm.
Gonna take you guys off this beautiful.
Rounded staircase which coincidentally.
When i was first looking at this home.
I hated so much this entire wall used to.
Be all ship flap and the railings were.
Different and it was.
So ugly i actually talked to my.
Contractor about removing the routed.
Staircase all together.
But once we made a few changes it really.
Came together and now i.
Am obsessed it is the most beautiful.
Stunning focal point of the home and.
I just love that it brings your eye.
Upwards into this gorgeous round.
Landing area.
Music.
One of my favorite parts about the.
Entire house is this bookshelf wall.
Mainly because we have a rolling ladder.
I don't know why this is just my biggest.
Dream.
Music.
It's not perfect we have a cute little.
Chair just sit down and relax and we.
Also have this gorgeous.
Huge mirror for lots of outfit photos i.
Always take my instagram selfies in here.
In.
The morning but i have my new looks on.
Speaking of having looks on the first.
Room that i want to take you guys to.
Upstairs.
Is the fitting room now this is once.
Again one of those bedrooms that we.
Converted into.
One place but we actually are in here.
Literally.
All the time i hope you guys have.
Noticed but i've been working a lot on.
My style recently trying to just go for.
More elevated.
High fashion looks thanks my new stylist.
Lena who you guys met a few videos ago.
And this is where her like work space is.
We have clothing rocks with different.
Future outfits.
Some of these you guys have seen some of.
Them you have not seen just yet so.
Hopefully you'll be excited we have a.
Bunch of really cool pairs of shoes as.
Well to pair along with the outfits.
And then we have this massive.
Floor-to-ceiling mirror which is either.
Our fitting room.
Mirror or also a lot of times we learn.
Tic tocs in here too.
And this is like the dance studio next.
Door to the fitting room is.
Lewis's bedroom now you guys obviously.
Know lewis he's in the background of.
Almost every single one of my videos and.
You've seen him on my instagram as well.
I don't want to go too in depth because.
Obviously this is his space and not mine.
Um i.
Had to use adjectives to describe this.
Room it would be.
Um straight sure.
Well what else we want to say there's.
Artwork of a girl getting changed on the.
Wall.
There's shoes everywhere it is art but.
It's.
Very straight so that's lewis's room.
Sure right next to lucy's room is the.
Laundry room there's not much to say.
About the laundry room.
There's a double washer and dryer.
Because we have so many clothing items.
In this house that need to get washed.
All the time.
Maybe cute little blue pendant and just.
Some things that are air dry and then.
Right across the hall from lewis's room.
Is trevor's room once again this is.
Trevor space not mine so i don't want to.
Do the tour for him but.
It's very very cute very simple he has.
His desk there because trevor is still.
In college.
Which is incredible he balances doing.
Full-on school work and working with me.
Full-time which is amazing we love him.
And we stand.
Very kind of like similar vibes to the.
Guest room downstairs lots of cool.
Gray blue and like tam tones very like.
Beachy.
Decor and i love knocking on trevor's.
Door every single morning getting him up.
And ready for the day now the last.
Bedroom that i'm going to take you guys.
To on the upstairs level is of course.
Going to be.
The master bedroom which is across the.
Hall now we have these.
Beautiful double doors and it leads.
Right into my space.
Music.
We have this beautiful four poster bed.
Keeping the same theme with the beachy.
Vibes.
Tan pillows blue pillows cute little.
Accents we have this leather bench.
We have this gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous.
Gorgeous chandelier in the middle of the.
Room.
Personally i hate chandeliers i don't.
Know what it is i can never find ones.
That i like but this one.
And the one downstairs were really.
Speaking to me so i'm so glad that we.
Found this one up for the space i think.
It is.
Perfect along the opposite wall we have.
Another fireplace which is.
So beautiful i love this matte stone.
I've actually never seen anything like.
That before especially with the wood.
Accents i think it looks.
So good we have this tv which i.
Literally never use.
Some shelves and then also fun little.
Added feature there's a mini fridge in.
Here.
This is actually fully filled with water.
But i just finished it and have not.
Restocked it yet so i promise that i'm.
Not drinking coke before bed.
The addiction is bad but not that bad i.
Have a mini fridge.
Okay come on into the master bathroom.
Music.
Okay you guys i am obsessed with this.
Massive bathroom because of how big it.
Is.
As you can see there's pretty much two.
Of everything and i'll explain why.
It's because this bathroom and closet.
Was actually formatted to be his and.
Hers.
But since it's be living here it's just.
His and his there's two different things.
There's two different toilets as well.
One sheared tub and then one massive.
Massive.
Marble shower as of right now it's only.
Been using this in the morning but who.
Knows what future activities could.
You know ensue later on next to the.
Shower as well i have this heated.
Towel rack which is so nice to leave.
Online in the shower so when i get out.
Of the shower and it's freezing cold.
I get to warm up in my nice little towel.
I thought that was a fun feature.
Uh this is always the vanity that i use.
For getting ready so i have like my hair.
Hair stuff over there.
And then this vanity is like my personal.
Care item so i have.
My one size patrick star makeup wipes.
And of course my soap my moisturizer.
Um deodorant and then i have my on my.
Sands and medium light which i'm.
Literally wearing.
Right now i always use it for tanning.
Stuff and then the serene to keep my.
Breath.
Fresh right next to the master bathroom.
Speaking of his and hers we have the.
Master.
Closet now this is one of the faces in.
The house that actually took the most.
Time with the renovations because there.
Was a lot of work to be done in here.
Like i was mentioning it was a his and.
Hers type of situation and originally.
This closet was the like his closet.
Used to be gray black very like dark and.
Dreary.
And it actually had a door on it so we.
Opened up the entire wall we painted it.
White.
This is the closet where i keep all my.
Custom dressy or like costume.
Type pieces if you guys look around.
There's a lot of really iconic moments.
In here that you guys have seen at.
Coachella different red carpets.
Influencer as well.
And i'm very much looking forward to.
Adding more pieces to this closet.
As i do more exciting things in my.
Career and then coming right out of the.
Extravagant costume closet we have the.
More everyday casual closet.
And this is like my absolute dream a lot.
Of the other places that i've lived in.
The past okay my downtown apartment then.
My last home.
Did not really have the best closet.
Space literally in the last house i had.
Clothes everywhere because it was.
Overflowing.
So it is so nice to finally have a.
Massive closet where i can put.
Everything all in this entire wall i.
Have my different hoodies t-shirts.
I have jackets in here different bags in.
Here my more formal cases.
Here pants more jackets lots of shoes.
Jewelry in the middle lots of.
Accessories.
This is the ultimate dream for me as a.
Wannabe hopefully one day in the future.
Fashion guru all right you guys now the.
Last place that i want to show you of.
The master bedroom.
Is the outdoor patio we have these.
Gorgeous.
Sliding glass doors which actually open.
All the way up.
So it's just very much like luxurious.
Indoor outdoor.
Space i love these pocket doors and this.
Is one of my favorite places.
Of the entire house this patio actually.
Gets direct sunlight all day long which.
Is.
So nice especially during these hot.
Months in the summer here in california.
There's been so many afternoons where.
I've laid out here tanning and like the.
Day beds which we got from restoration.
Hardware.
And then once the sun goes down we have.
These outdoor couches chairs as well.
And this massive fireplace in the middle.
Where my friends and i can roast.
Marshmallows and then look up with the.
Stars in the sky.
The patio also has the most gorgeous.
Stunning view of the backyard.
Actually no no no don't show that just.
Yet that's gonna be a full reveal for.
Later on in the video okay now that you.
Guys have seen the upstairs and the.
Bedrooms and also the main floor.
There's still one floor left of the.
House that i have not yet.
Shown you guys ever since i started.
Doing youtube about four or five years.
Ago now.

Like to have the perfect.
Sisters headquarters we've been.
Renovating for months.
