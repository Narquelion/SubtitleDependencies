From editing yesterday's video so it.
Looks like i'm gonna be running on four.
Hours of sleep today but that's a.
Personal problem not your guys's today's.
Schedule is absolutely jam-packed we.
Have so many fun things to do and also a.
Lot of business to take care of but.
Unfortunately most of those things that.
I have to do today require me to wear a.
Full face of glam makeup even though my.
Job is a beauty guru my heart lies in.
Doing creative makeup and fun videos and.
Not wearing makeup around for long.
Periods of time that is in fact one of.
My least favorite things in the world.
Since i'm just gonna be doing my normal.
Everyday makeup routine that i've.
Literally showed you guys 64 times.
Already i thought i would try to make.
This video a little bit more interesting.
By making it into a vlog so i'm gonna.
Take you guys around with me all day.
Today and to make it even more.
Interesting we're gonna be testing out a.
Setting spray that claims it can last.
For up to 16 hours i honestly have no.
Idea what time i'm gonna get back home.
Tonight and be able to do glam i am.
Praying it's not 16 hours at this point.
If it is i'm just like going back to bed.

Always grab a fan or even like a big.
Pallet and use that to dry your face off.

I'm currently replying to a bunch of.
Different comments oh i don't know this.

That but i want to happen because it has.
Been about five hours of writing this.
Now and look at my freaking face.
Are you kidding it looks so good my skin.
Is still extremely matte like you can't.
See any oil or anything oh so good the.
Only thing is here there's one little.
Crease and then of course lip krusty's.
But that happens every time i wear my.
Makeup that's my actual skin it is still.
Not i see absolutely no oil i am a.
Little bit shook by this settings for.
You guys this is working way better than.
I even expected so i'm currently walking.
Right now in downtown only to get my.
Nails done.
I need a fail so badly please stop.
Commenting on my videos and instagram.
Pictures done in 81 i know that they.
Look awful i just haven't had any time.
But i'm gonna go to my normal guy he.
Doesn't so good it get a nice nude set.
It is literally so hot and sunny today.
In la but oh my god that how it looks.
Amazing.
I feel really hot on the inside and i.
Feel like i should be sweating but my.
Skin is actually staying really really.
Dry.
Music.
You.
So i just finished my nail appointment.
It is currently 356 p.m. at my skin is.
Still looking so public okay's i'm.
Literally not sweating not only in the.
Slightest this looks amazing that is.
Probably the most needed fill like ever.
Of history my nails look so bad.
Thank god they are now on fleek and.
Ready to go i'm gonna head home right.
Now and edit as much as i possibly can.
For a little bit and then head over to.
Dinner i need to see it's the sort ana.
Ana mari and trevor i have not seen them.
And literally so long of course you guys.
To be coming with me so let's go it is.
30 at night and my skin is.
Still looking so so bom.
I am getting a little excuse me miss i.
Went the servo show i am still welding.
My makeup today tara do you notice.
Anything different on my face in a 737.
Where you might wake up for almost 12.
Hours now i think that is ten hours we.
Love a mouth but yeah it still looks so.
Good like i would have not done any.
Touch-ups.
Are you kidding oh so good this needed.
Hello sisters i just got back home and.
47 p.m. meeting i've.
Had this makeup on now for more than 14.
Hours oh my god i am being 150 % honest.
By saying i have not touched up my face.
Once today and looking in the mirror it.
Looks still so good if we're being picky.
Here my lips are obviously a little bit.
Crusty because i was just eating i do.
Have a smile crease but literally i.
Always get that that's because i smile.
All day every day and my under eyes are.
Creasing as well but literally like look.
At my freaking skin it still looks.
Flawless if anything is looking a little.
Bit early i would say it's my nose but.
Like i'm not even mad at it that happens.
All the time no matter what and usually.
It happens within like one hour of me.
Doing my makeup it's been 14 i'm.
Honestly beyond impressed it out with.
Those skin and navy eye makeup finishing.
Spray this claims that it's supposed to.
Last for 16 hours and obviously i only.
Wore it for 14 but let's be real who's.
Gonna wear makeup for 16 hours straight.
First of all not me i'll tell you that.
Right now i think it's very safe to say.
At this point that this setting spray is.
A huge huge win in my book as well as.
The primer spray as well both the oil.
Control versions like i said my face.
Looks so beat still.
14 hours i'm ready to take this off yes.
But if i need it to keep going out with.
This what i yeah probably if you guys.
