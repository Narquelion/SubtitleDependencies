Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel for.
Today's video i have something very very.
Special plan that i actually don't do.
Very often and that is a review i really.
Don't do reviews that often mostly.
Because i have my favorite products that.
I like to stick to an every single.
Makeup look but also when it comes to.
Reviews people love love love to share.
Their opinions and if you love a product.
You're eating somebody's ass or you're.
Being paid to do so and if you hate a.
Product you're jealous you're angry.
Because you're not on a pr list or who.
Freaking knows every time i do a review.
And i read the comment i could just feel.
The brain cells being sucked right out.
Of my head but when i saw this launch.
And when i saw the price tag and you.
Guys know exactly what i'm talking about.
Based on the title of the video i'm.
Talking about the brand new kylie.
Cosmetics 360 dollar brush that i had to.
Show you guys the realty i am gonna do.
My entire makeup routine today using the.
Brand new kylie brushes i'm gonna try to.
Use every single brush in here in some.
Difference that with my makeup routine.
To show you guys if the brushes are.
Really worth the three hundred and sixty.
Dollars i haven't even started yet but.
Just going into it i will tell you guys.
They're probably not gonna be worth it.
So i picked up dupes of every single one.
Of the kylie brushes from morphe i'll.
Tell you guys right now they are much.
Much much cheaper so i'm gonna doing a.
12 my face using the kylie brushes and.
The other half my face using the same.
Exact brush do and we're gonna see what.
Style looks better in the end.
Before we get to the full review i do.
Want to disclose something because this.
Video will not go all the way up my.
Fenty beauty video went i absolutely.
Love kylie she's honestly one of my role.
Models i think she is beautiful and i'm.
Very very hard-working woman i am very.
Proud of her and her makeup line i think.
So it's been absolutely incredible and.
She is obviously killing it regardless.
Of what you think about her those are my.
Opinions you don't have to share them.
Not being said i am not on her pr list i.
Did not get these brushes sent to me.
Early in the mail i was actually gonna.
Have to wait another two weeks to get.
Them and order them just like everybody.
Else when they went online to the public.
But major shout out to my baby but kris.
And dominique who let me borrow her set.
Early i'm gonna give these brushes a.
Fair shot if they are amazing you will.
See if they suck you guys will.
Definitely see i really could not care.
Less about the fact that i'm not on her.
Pr list.
Like i said beforehand influencers.
Literally cannot win i love currently.
But i'm not on her pr list so apparently.
I'm so angry.
So hopefully this evens out the playing.
Field so i can give you guys a full.
Unbiased review that would have been.
Unbiased vergara.
Last by these comments oh there are a.
Lot sometimes now that that is all been.
Said let's jump into the damn brushes so.
For the holiday season kylie cosmetics.
Launched chart silver luxury brushed sat.
Which is right here it comes with 16.
Different brushes and the set of all 16.
Retails online for 360 dollars oh my god.
You get all the brushes and a little.
Silver carrying case with them as you.
Can see all the brushes have little.
White hairs some of them are dual fiber.
And some of them are just a regular.
Brushes and apparently kylie said on.
Twitter that these are all real hair as.
Well they are not synthetic.
So that means they are i think not.
Cruelty free and not vegan so if that's.
Something that you were very out of it.
About this brush is probably not the.
Brush that for you.
I've talked about this a few times.
Before but i per say i'm really not the.
Biggest fan of brush sets when people.
Ask me what types of brushes to order i.
Always tell them to go through a website.
And really pick up brushes that they.
Know they're going to use based on their.
Different steps of their makeup routine.
Everybody has different techniques and.
Different brushes that they like to use.
For different things and i think when.
You order a brush that they're always.
Gonna be a few brushes in there that you.
Will literally never touch simply.
Because of your personal choices when it.
Comes to makeup and that is really okay.
But it's obviously money down the drain.
I will say though looking at all the.
Kylie brushes laid down next to each.
Other there really are not that many.
Brushes that i don't think i would pick.
Up and i feel like i could get a good.
Use out of all of them so at least.
That's a really great thing if you are.
Someone like me though and don't like.
Brush sets all the brushes will be sold.
Individually online as well when the.
Full set launches i'm gonna go through.
All the individual prices as i go.
Through my makeup routine but all.
Together these brushes equate to three.
Hundred and seventy eight dollars and if.
You buy the set it takes eighteen.
Dollars off and goes to 360 what a steal.
On the contrary i told her of all the.
Closest dupes i could find from morphe.
And if you order all of these sixteen.
Brushes your total comes to one hundred.
And fifteen dollars but if we use co.
Change or ten percent of your purchase.
Which you've definitely should it.
Becomes one hundred and four dollars.
Which is two hundred and fifty six.
Dollars cheaper than the kylie brushes.
Now that we have the price is all fully.
Broken down let's go ahead and start our.
Makeup on this side of my face i'm gonna.
Use the kylie brushes and on this side.
I'm gonna using the same dupes from.
Morphe and we're gonna see what side.
Performs better.
Let's go sir do my foundation today i'm.
Gonna use my too faced born this way.
Foundation do you guys know this is my.
All-time favorite and for my less on my.
Face i'm gonna use the kylie brush.
Number two which is the large stippling.
Brush this brush has and his.
Multi-purpose face and body brush ideal.
For blending liquid or cream makeup and.
That retails for $30.
The closest dupe i could find for morphe.
Was the mb5 brush as you can see the.
Color is different but obviously they're.
Both duo fiber brushes of a very very.
Similar shape and this one is $10 this.
Is definitely an interesting feeling you.
Guys know that i don't really do my.
Foundation where the brush is that often.
And also this is a duo fiber brush so.
It's really not that dense which is.
Definitely giving us like my coverage.
But oh i really like this for the neck.
So big so it lets me blend it in easily.
That was good but over the face i don't.
Know how i'm feeling for a duo fiber.
Brush i'm honestly pleasantly surprised.
With this application it definitely did.
A really good job of giving me even.
Coverage all throughout but i will say.
That census is duo-fiber.
You can obviously see that there's a lot.
Of product in the brush now left over.
And it's really not that dense so i do.
Feel like the coverage as an s fill as.
Normal if i applied it with a sponge.
Looking in the mirror the application.
Looks absolutely identical on both sides.
They both honestly did a really good job.
Of blending it out the coverage is.
Decent i'm gonna take a little bit more.
Of that on a beauty blender and apply it.
To my nose because both brushes did.
Leave my nose a little bit sad and you.
Guys know that is always a struggle area.
For me these brushes both did a.
Perfectly fine job of doing my.
Foundation except one is $30 and one is.
$10 and kylie's line she does not have a.
Brush dedicated to concealer and i.
Personally never use the brush when it.
Comes to concealer either so i'm just.
Gonna go ahead and apply my shake paper.
In the shade light as normal before i go.
In and blend this out i'm going to cream.
Contour my face today using my benefit.
Hoola stick you guys know that i really.
Don't do this that often but kylie does.
Have a good a cream contour so for my.
Kylie side i'm gonna using the kylie.
Jenner brush number seven which is the.
Medium stippling brush and these retails.
For $22 and on my morphe side i'm gonna.
Using the m49 to literally the exact.
Same brush and this retails for $8 i'm.
Gonna put this in in the hollows of my.
Cheeks.
On the jawline and then in the corners.
On my forehead as well.
Oh just like the first brush as you can.
See this is doing a really really great.
Job blending everything out there are no.
Streaky lines that everything is looking.
At really really seamless i'm not gonna.
Go over to the morphe side so before.
Actually use these i thought that these.
Brushes were really really similar.
Shapes as you can see from this angle.
But if we turn them to the side the.
Kylie brush is actually a lot more thick.
Than the morphe brush i am noticing.
Right away that i have to blend a little.
Bit harder for the morphe brush and this.
Shape is actually not gonna lie a little.
Bit better but then again $22 $8 here's.
The kylie side and here's the morphe.
Side once again application looks.
Exactly the same i'm just gonna add a.
Lot about a shade table right here to.
Cut the contour and then i'm going to.
Blend everything out just up my face in.
Place today i'm going to using my.
Setting powder mixture you guys almost.
My all-time favorite and for my kylie.
Side i'm gonna be using the kylie brush.
Number three which is the medium tapered.
Brush which retails for $28 and.
Originally for the morphe side i had.
Picked out the m5 30 but now looking at.
These i'm realizing that these shapes.
Are nowhere near similar so i definitely.
Will take on that one and instead i'm.
Gonna be using the morphe r3 brush which.
Retails for or $12 you guys know that i.
Usually use my beauty blender when it.
Comes to setting powder so this is gonna.
Be a little bit interesting in this.
Definite a little bit babe to be an.
Under eye setting powder brush but you.
Know what we're gonna give it a try to.
See but this is very very round.
I would definitely prefer a more tapered.
Brush to do this something like this one.
From its sigmod like this can really get.
Like right under there as you can see.
But honestly the fact that this morphe.
Brush is a little bit more tapered and.
Synthetic i feel like it's applying the.
Powder better because it is a little bit.
More dense and kind of packs it in there.
Whereas the kylie brush is obviously.
Real hair so it kind of feels a little.
Bit strange to apply a setting powder.
With but once again application looks.
Exactly the same to set the rest i face.
In place i'm gonna use in the kylie.
Brush number one which is the large.
Powder brush perfect for blending all of.
Her face and body powders and this one.
Retails for a whopping 48 dollars the.
Closest dupe i could find it was the.
Morphe m42 for the shape is slightly.
Different but they're both.
Huge dense powder brushes except this.
One is $10 so you're saving yourself a.
Whopping 38 bucks i'm just going to take.
This brush and tap off the excess oh my.
God whoa that actually caught a lot of.
Powder i'm certainly not mad at it let's.
Go ahead and try the morphe brush oh.
Whoa.
Once again picked up a tip on a powder.
Once again application looks exactly the.
Same for bronzer today i'm gonna apply.
The benefit hoola bronzer and i'm gonna.
Use the kylie brush number four on this.
Side of my face this one retails for $26.
And on my morphe sign i'm gonna use my a.
Matte 5 to 3 which we chose for $15 what.
I do like about these brushes is that.
They are pretty dense so when i go and.
Would like something like bronzer or.
Like a cream contour and kind of stipple.
It into my face and kind of blend it it.
Doesn't pick up the product underneath.
Which it's a really really good thing.
I'm gonna do the same exact thing on my.
Morphe side once again applications.
Exactly the same next for a more precise.
Contour i'm gonna go my kat von d shade.
And light palette as always and i might.
Highly say it i'm gonna grab my number 5.
Brush which retails for $24 and on my.
Morphe side i'm gonna grab my m for all.
Five it retails for eight dollars and as.
You can see these are literally the.
Exact same brush i'm just gonna tuck.
That right into the cheekbone and then.
Same exact thing i really doubt you can.
Tell on camera but in person i feel like.
I can tell just because they look at my.
Face with makeup on almost every single.
Day the bristles on the m 405 from.
Morphe are a lot softer so it's making.
I'm much more diffused contour wears on.
The kylie brush so brushes are a lot.
More dense which makes it a little bit.
Harder for a diffused application but to.
The everyday makeup person nobody can.
Tell it looks the exact same let's be.
Real next i'm gonna play my blush which.
Is gonna be a mac peach is my all-time.
Favorite and from the kylie site i'm.
Gonna be using my number six brush which.
Is the rounded blush brush this retails.
For $28 mmm i'm or if we say i'm gonna.
Use my g1 brush which is the closest.
Dupe i could find this one is eight.
Dollars now looking at these obviously.
This is a synthetic brush so i would.
Really never use this for blush that's.
Definitely more like a buffer brush for.
Like blending in found a.
But you know what sister kylie says it's.
For blush we're gonna use it for blush.
Oh yeah i do not like that i would just.
Never reach for this shape or type of.
Brush when it comes to blush application.
I usually use my p4 brush which as you.
Can see it's very very soft an ankle -.
Lets you get a very very like diffused.
Light wash of color this is very very.
Done so i'm probably spooked to try out.
The g one oh my god kylie side morphe.
Side it certainly doesn't look bad i.
Would just literally never reach for.
Those brushes when it comes to blush one.
Fly condors are all in place i'm going.
To bake my face as usual using my beauty.
Blender.
While i'm picking the oven i'm gonna go.
Ahead and quickly dry brows off-camera.
Then it will come back for the cleanup.
Process kylie did not release any angled.
Brushes so i'm just gonna use my eyebrow.
Pencil i'll be right back.
Alright scissors back to business i'm.
Gonna go my tart shape table as always.
My kylie brush number 14 this one is $18.
And my m22 for $3.
You guys know that i usually do my.
Concealer application using a flat top.
Concealer brush so i really don't think.
That i'm going to enjoy the application.
On either side but the brush did fine.
To stop my eyelid concealer in place and.
Prime for eyeshadow i'm gonna use my.
Kylie number 10 brush this is $20 and is.
The large shader brush although it is.
Super super dense this is literally not.
An eyeshadow brush i don't know what she.
Thinks she's doing calling this a large.
Shader brush trying to get this to put.
Any eyeshadow on the eyelid and make it.
Like any sort of defined or blended out.
It's not happening i really do like the.
Shape and density of this brush for.
Packing on trends with a primer to the.
List but this is classified as a large.
Shader brush that i would literally.
Never use this for any sort of shading.
On the eyeshadow so i think this would.
Be one of the brushes that like i said.
It's useless to the set for the more of.
You said i'm gonna grab my five to four.
Brush and this one is $6 so you're.
Saving yourself $14 just to set your.
Frickin eyelid concealer in place i want.
To do it very kylie i look today and i.
Do have a red carpet later on so i don't.
Want to do anything too too intense i'm.
Gonna grab the mac cosmetics act.
Patrick starr eyes shadow quads i am so.
Happy and proud of sisters are for these.
Amazing collaborations they are so dope.
So i'm just gonna doing a fun i liquid.
These today for transition shade i'm.
Going to dip into this light brown shade.
In this quad with my kylie number 15.
Brush this is the tapered blending brush.
And it is $28 and on the morphe said i'm.
Gonna do the same exact thing using.
13 and this one is $6 oh whoa.
Okay not gonna lie this feels really.
Really nice on the eyelid next i'm gonna.
Dip into it this shade right here using.
My kylie number 12 brush this one is $20.
And i'm going to use the exact dupe.
Which is the morphe i'm up for 3 3 which.
Is $6 interesting even though these.
Brushes are two very very similar shapes.
And sizes the kylie brush actually.
Doesn't really taper out on the top it.
Kind of stays the same density whereas.
The morphe brush does taper out a little.
Bit more so i think in this scenario i.
Do prefer the m 4-3-3 from morphe simply.
Because it allows for a much more.
Blended application i'm next gonna dip.
Into this brown shade using my number.
Thirteen brush this is the small shader.
Brush and it is $18 and on the other.
Side i'm gonna grab my a matte one five.
Three foot morpheus same exact shape.
This one is $2.
I'm just gonna pack the shade right on.
That outer v it too deep out that edge.
And then pull it slightly into the.
Crease same situation with this lash.
Brush as you can see over here it kind.
Of looks a little bit unblended.
That's because the top edge doesn't.
Taper off at all it's actually more of a.
Rounded thing it makes it really really.
Hard for a precise application in the.
Crease i'm gonna go over those i just.
Make sure they're really blend it out.
Using my number eleven brush from kylie.
Which is sixteen dollars it is this.
Angled blending brush i personally hate.
These brushes and think there's.
Literally no point of them they do.
Absolutely nothing but just to this.
Think of it i do want to use all the.
Brushes and for the morphe dupe is my m5.
16 this one is six dollars for my eyelid.
I'm gonna grab the kylee concealer brush.
This is the number fourteen brush that i.
Use for my brows earlier and dip into.
This shade right up in here and i'm.
Going to give it a little bit of a.
Spritz with some fix+ and then i'm just.
Gonna pack this right onto the inner.
Eyelid i know this is a kylie review but.
Wow sister patrick snapped on these.
Shots so good.
For my lower lash that i'm going to dip.
Into that same warm brown shade on my.
Number thirteen brush and also my m1 53.
Brush that i'm gonna use this to define.
It.
Oh that was way easier with that brush.
And then finally with my number 12 slash.
M4a3 three brush i'm gonna dip into the.
Original transition shade and just go.
Right over that bottom edge.
All right scissors off kara i quickly.
Just went apply of some wing liner on in.
Both eyes to snatch up this look popped.
On some lashes these are the new bounds.
I'm a dragon lean mini and then of.
Course a mascara to blend them together.
Looking in the mirror this eye look is.
Beautiful sister patrick you killed it.
With this collection but that is not the.
Focus of this video let's be real both.
Of these eyes look exactly the same.
Let's go ahead finish off the rest of.
The face i'm gonna grab both my big.
Powder brushes and brush away the bake.
Before we highly i'm gonna get my skin a.
Quick spritz of my mac fix+.
Just to kind of meld all those powders.
Together because let's be real we.
Definitely have a lot on today for.
Highlighter on my kylie said i'm gonna.
Grab my number eight brush which is.
These small fluff brush and dip into my.
Anasazi so hollywood illuminator you.
Guys know it's my all-time favorite and.
This one retails for a whopping up $22.
She's gonna give this a slight spritz as.
Well and pop this right on the cheekbone.
Oh whoa okay obviously this is doing a.
Really great job of applying a blinding.
Highly i mean damn i will say though.
Once again this brush is not really.
Tapered on the top it is kind of more.
Like slightly rounded almost even flat.
And it is pretty dense so it's.
Definitely not like blending it out as.
Much as i would love it to my murphy.
Said i'm gonna grab my our 31 brush this.
One is a total of five dollars once.
Again giving it a light sprit and then.
Popping it on the cheekbone yep same.
Exact glow you guys know when it comes.
To highlight in my face i usually will.
Reach for a looking am 501 brush.
Obviously the shape is very very.
Different but i am going for exact dupes.
Today i do wish this brush was more.
Tapered like this one for a more precise.
Application but you know what we can't.
Always get what we want in life i'm.
Gonna go back into like highly number 5.
Brush and just make sure that my contour.
And highlighter are nice and blended.
Together and not looking too.
And same exact thing on the work piece.
Out of miami 405 next we have the number.
Nine brush and then do my heart for this.
Is the morphe three one you guys know.
That i really am not the biggest fan of.
Fan brush especially when it comes to.
Hiding i just don't like the application.
Work are all this i'm gonna use it today.
Just the sake of the video this one is.
Twenty dollars and this one is five.
Dollars i'm gonna dip into the slightest.
Bit of artist couture illuminati and.
Just place that right on the high points.
Of my highlighter i feel like that did.
Nothing once again make that did nothing.
Can people just stop making fan brushes.
Literally this has been a psa james.
Charles hates me eye brushes and last.
But certainly not least we have the.
Kylie brush number six teen this is a.
Tiny pencil brush this one retails for.
Eighteen whopping dollars compared to.
The morphe m43 one which retails for as.
You can see they're both tiny pencil.
Brushes i will say that the morphe want.
Is a little bit more tapered so that is.
My fault but let's be real based on a.
Trend of all the brushes we've tried so.
Far they're gonna perform exactly the.
Same for my inner corner i'm gonna be.
Using one of the tarte chrome pots and.
This is the shade of top yacht this is a.
Check that i tried a few days ago and i.
Absolutely loved how it look this is.
Just so bright and blinding and of.
Course i'm using my kylie number 16.
Brush i'm gonna spritz it the slightest.
Bit and just pop it right on you see how.
Bright that is oh my god this is.
Literally the best thing that ever it's.
So freakin pretty hello alright guys i.
Just wanna hadn't thrown a lip quickly.
Off camera this is the ofra liquid.
Lipstick in the shade.
And that completes this luck as you can.
See here we have the kylie brush aside.
Totaling at three hundred and sixty.
Dollars and on the other side we have.
Morphe brushes totaling at one hundred.
And four dollars now my face is all.
Complete and i've used every single one.
Of these brushes from both collections.
Let's go ahead and spill the tea once.
Another kylie brushes on line let's be.
Real we were all shook as hell by the.
Price point three hundred sixty dollars.
Especially for a new brand like kylie is.
Way way too high that being said though.
Almost every single products news.
Release in the past has been pretty good.
Like i said i'm not on her pr let so.
Everything that i've tried from.
Has been a personally bought from me not.
Being paid to say anything but it is.
Pretty good stuff so major props to.
Kelly for that based on carly's past.
Product has 3ik going into this i really.
Didn't think the brushes were gonna be.
Bad at all and let's be real they really.
Weren't most of the brushes did exactly.
What they were supposed to do and one of.
Them being number seven in my opinion.
Even performed better than the dupe from.
Morphe on the other hand harbor there.
Were a few more view brushes that in my.
Opinion outperformed kylie mostly being.
The eye brushes a lot of the blending.
Brushes specifically number 12 did a.
Really really great job at packing the.
Color on there but i will say that i.
Wish they were more tapered all the tops.
Of these brushes are very very rounded.
Which is great however they're very very.
Dense at the top and don't really taper.
Out which makes it a little bit harder.
To get a more precise application that's.
Actually when it comes to crease work.
Overall what i recommend the kylie.
Cosmetics silver luxury brush sat.
Absolutely not the brushes all did.
Exactly what they're supposed to do and.
Applied the makeup perfectly fine just.
Like normal.
None of the brushes are fraying and they.
Are really really good-quality i just.
Don't think it's worth the price point i.
Really just can't justify spending three.
Hundred sixty dollars on her brush set.
When their brands out there like morphe.
Making the exact same dupes for way.
Cheaper i mean literally i think the.
Cheapest morphe brush was $2.00 and the.
Cheapest kylie brush was $18 i mean.
There's even like bh cosmetics out there.
Where you can literally get the same.
Exact brush set for $15 don't get me.
Wrong i really really love kylie but.
That's literally some people's entire.
Like house payment or rent payment or.
Car payment like that is just way too.
Much it is not like these brushes are.
Literally doing our makeup for us or.
Face tuning our photos after i'm not.
Gonna tell kylie how to run her brand.
Because clearly she's doing a perfectly.
Fine job on her own she made almost five.
Hundred million dollars last year.
Literally a living legend but i do wish.
She would make her mice a lot more.
Affordable so more people could get them.
And not just a beauty gurus all that.
Being said though if you are a huge.
Kylie stand like myself and you want to.
Support her on this brush launch at.
Least you know you're getting good.
Quality brushes for your money.
