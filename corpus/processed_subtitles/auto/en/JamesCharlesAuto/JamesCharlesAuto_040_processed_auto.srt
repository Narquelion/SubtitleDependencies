Look like it did much but we're gonna.
Use it anyways alright now we're going.
Back into our big nose we're going to.
Blend it with our big eyebrows so we're.
Going to connect the two you're gonna do.
That by putting a straight line down.
Your nose trying to make it look skinny.
But we all know it's not skinny then.
We're going to reinforce it with this.
Dirty sponge again make it nice and.
Straight lines good job james so it's.
