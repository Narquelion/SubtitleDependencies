Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel.
Today i'm up bright and early because i.
Am filming a video that i.
Truly never imagined would be happening.
Uh today i'm gonna be adopting a child.
I love kids i think they're the cutest i.
Think they're the funniest i know i have.
A lot of young fans out there as well.
And i love you guys.
So so so much but i have only talked.
About.
At least right now in my life the fact.
That i do not want kids i just don't.
Think that i'd be responsible enough to.
Actually have a child and i would never.
Want to bring a kid into this world and.
Not be able to take a good care of it.
And i just referred to a child as it.
This is why.
Every time that i talk about not wanting.
To have kids though every single adult.
Around me always yells at me and it's.
Like okay you never know until you try.
So i guess that is the point of today's.
Video i'm going to be adopting a child.
Hi guys hi elia.
