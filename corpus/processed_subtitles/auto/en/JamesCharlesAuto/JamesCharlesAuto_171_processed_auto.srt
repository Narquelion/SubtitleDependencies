Music.
Alright you guys let's just shall write.
And a fan that definitely picked a lot.
Of my go-to favorite products but i.
Think he was also trying to challenge me.
As one of my fellow subscribers that is.
Tired of using the same products over.
And over again so let's just do this and.
Have a really good time our first moment.
That pen picked is our foundation and.
That is the dior eric last foundation i.
Forgot how do you apply this that's my i.
Play put this in the back of a mirror.
Actually sharon's gonna bond this right.
And alright you guys so this place.
Already on it this foundation is looking.
At really a really beautiful or conceal.
I'm gonna go to my tarte shape tape this.
Is my holy grail favorite and pin and.
Pin i was gonna say pin did pick this.
One vindictus 100k then will literally.
Sit outside at the studio door crying.
Until you let him in and then once he's.
In here he will want to leave.
Approximately 30 seconds later all right.
Now jocelin the my system of this all.
Over i'm really concerned what i'm gonna.
Do is grab me a little bit of a regular.
Setting powder just put right underneath.
The original a little bit of dijon.
Cosmetics luminous powder in.
Do me do me too me too me like that's.
Gonna grab a fluffy brush and i guess.
Like put this on here i was really.
Scared that by applying this with a.
Brush it was going to really get very.
Very like shining shimmering splendid.
Effect on the skin but it definitely.
It's not it is still setting everything.
In plates but it does have a really nice.
Like shy you're kidding.
I definitely looking forward to playing.
This a little bit more and seeing what.
It's capable of but so far.
Holy waiting yeah cool we are looking a.
Very flat and i desperately want to add.
Some contour back to the face so i'm.
Going to grab the anasazi beverly hills.
At contour palette that finn so kindly.
Selected and that bryce just going to.
Grab my actually mac-11 3us brush and.
I'm just going to grab the kind of light.
Shade in the light banana shade and use.
A little bit of this to highlight the.
Center of my face then i was gonna grab.
My morphe am at 405 brush use code after.
10% and dip into the middle cool telenet.
Shade of this palette i think the shade.
Is actually called fawn if i remember.
Correctly it's gonna use a little bit of.
This dish as well my cheekbones my.
Forehead look a little bit smaller.
Especially with my hair in the growing.
Back recovery up process that's honestly.
Been the most frustrating thing of like.
This whole hair journey i feel like i've.
Talked about this a million times.
Already but you guys know that i used to.
Have like my little curly hair where i.
Would like kind of swoop over the.
Forehead and give the illusion of like a.
Tiny here.
Hairline yeah can't do that anymore so.
That's been really on my mind to get it.
Then lastly cover um five to seven i'm.
Just gonna dip into the warmer tone.
Shade away in this left-hand corner and.
I'm going to use this to kind of warm up.
My face a little bit timewe nose contour.
Brussels gonna use a mix of these two.
Colors and chisel out the nose as well.
Or even a sofa blush to fit picked my.
Go-to favorite mac peaches he only had.
Two options it was either pink or peach.
Instead of divid with my evil brush and.
Not a little bit of a color back into my.
Cheek region just for a nice little wash.
Already base and i would have time for.
Brows and fana did pick the anasazi.
Beverly hills brow is in the shade and.
Medium brown that being said you guys to.
Me do this a million times i'm going to.
Do this off camera quickly and i'll be.
Right back to do it the eyeshadow.
Portion because that's what it's gonna.
Start getting a little questionable ah.
So the brows are all on and now that.
Means it is time for the eyeshadow.
Portion now the colors that finnegan.
Chose for this look today.
I would say it wouldn't be my first.
Choice of eyeshadow colors to use we.
Have socialblade daddy cola and acapella.
And then tune okay i'm gonna survive i'm.
Gonna have what four five six brush and.
Dip into a daddy and i'm going to place.
This into the crease and now i'm going.
To grab and then four three three brush.
Dip into a social blade which is our.
Bright green shade and i'm going to use.
This and like just barely blend out the.
Edge of that daddy can i have an m4 for.
One and dip into tune and use this to.
Just buff out that green pitch have.
Another girl what kind of look that i.
Wanted to do for this and i really have.
To come to the collusion that the red.
Lip is going to mess it up later on so.
We're just gonna cut the crease and hope.
For the best.
I will change out the lip for the.
Instagram photo now on this cut crease.
I'm going to grab a sigma e27 brush and.
Just dip into it cola and i'm gonna.
Place this right in this outer corner.
Over top with this concealer and this is.
Going to blend nicely into daddy and.
Then with a flat brush i'm going to grab.
Acapella and i'm gonna place that in the.
Middle of the lid this looks so pretty.
And it's gonna get completely ruined by.
A red lip i cannot get that oh it's.
Never for the lower lashline it's gonna.
Be super easy i'm just gonna first grab.
Miami four five six once again and dip.
Into a little bit of dotty and i'm just.
Gonna run this right up along my lash.
Line and connecting it to the outer.
Corner and then finally a little bit of.
A tune to tie it all together just to.
Make this look a little bit more sultry.
I'm just gonna grab a liquid a black.
Liner and i'm just going to add a little.
Bit of a wing finn did not pick this but.
I'm making the executive decision that.
It needs it.
Next i was going to be at the mascara.

Holy grail favorite mascara and i've.
Honestly been using it again and i kind.

With manny because i called him out for.
Only to cuff her eyes and nude lips it.
Was so stupid it was a huge mistake and.
It came from a really really big place.
Of entitlement when i was really really.
Uh and i'm very grateful that men and.
They were able to work it out and now.
I'm so lucky to call her my closest.
Friends in the community just wanted to.
