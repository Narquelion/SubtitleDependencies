Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel i'm.
Not realizing that i'm starting this.
Intro off with my eyebrows a hidden.
Third down i probably look crazy but.
That should be an indication that the.
Today's video is going to be a drive a.
Transformation last night i was watching.
My all time favorite show rupaul's drag.
Race.
And the queen's actually had such a cool.
Challenge and that was to make over five.
Different youtube stars first of all.
Very rude that i was not invited.
Sister rue hit me up girl i would have.
Been an amazing sister transformation.
But regardless it just really got me in.
The mood and it's been a few months.
Since i've done drugs and it's been a.
Lot of months or many months since i've.
Actually filled the drock tutorial i've.
Tried so many new techniques i've been.
Watching so many different videos and.
Hopefully i picked up on some brand new.
Things so i just feeling my woman.
Fantasies today and i want to do a drive.
A transformation started off my eyebrows.
Are clearly already glued down which is.
A very very annoying and long but vital.
Process to any good drag makeup tutorial.
I don't think i would look very womanly.
With the block bushy eyebrows that i.
Have right now so we got to cover up and.
Draw a new one on it which will be.
Coming in a short minute but i'm gonna.
Start off by priming and moisturize my.
Face that i using the touch-ups self-cam.
Bests just gonna put a light layer of.
This over my t-zone especially in my.
Moustache and beard region just to kind.
Of correct any texture before i go into.
Any foundation and really kind of clean.
Up the canvas for all the makeup they're.
About to put on we have one last step.
Which is going to be a color cocktail.
I'm gonna take the la girl pro concealer.
And this is in the shade of orange and.
I'm gonna put this over oh god.
Cut i put this over all my oh hello all.
My beard and moustache areas i literally.
Am a man and i shave it every morning.
But i still get 5 o'clock shadow like.
Three hours later i'm very tempted in.
Convinced that i want to get laser.
Surgery so please let us know your.
Experience with that if it's fun if it's.
Painful because i literally do not know.
But i'm really tempted to get all this.
Gone and i'm also gonna put a little bit.
Of this over my eyebrows as well because.
They're a little dark and by a little.
Bit i mean cover them up completely i'm.
Next good to take any dent a buffing.
Brush and lightly tap out this concealer.
Just so it's kind of evenly distributed.
And blend it all around because our next.
Up is going to be it to set it with.
Powder but if we put powder right on top.
Of it it's gonna be a little bit clumpy.
And grow so this is just a quick little.
Step in between alright guys this is the.
Completed look i really hope you guys.
Enjoyed and i will see you in the next.
Line i'm gonna take a powder puff in a.
Little bit of translucent powder and.
Just packet or right over top of that.
Formed just to set it in place until we.
Put the foundation on next it doesn't.
All get mixed together because although.
We definitely want a bronzed look we.
Don't want a donald trump glam today.
That's for sure.
I'm also gonna pack this powder into the.
Brows as well i have gotten pretty good.
At brow cover at this point and i've.
Also shown it in a few other videos.
Beforehand so make sure to click right.
Up here if you needed to trial on that i.
Know i started off this video with it.
But it's a very long process and i did.
Not want to waste 20 minutes of your.
Time teaching you how to glue down your.
Eyebrows today pressing in this powder.
Really hard after all the layers of glue.
Will really help eliminate some of that.
Texture and the powder will kind of fill.
Everything in to create a very blank and.
A flat base for everything to go over.
Top of this is scary for the foundation.
Today i'm going to go into the kryolan.
Tv paint stick and this is in the shade.
And b if you guys have never heard of.
These foundation sticks before they are.
Intense arla straightest police they're.
Literally full coverage enough to cover.
My scandalous so we definitely love this.
And we have a whole lot that we need to.
Cover today so i'm going to just go into.
This all over my face starting off with.
The brows and once again are really.
Pushing it in their gouge make sure.
Everything is all covered and then it's.
Going in with that everywhere else and.
There's gonna take a damp beauty blender.
This one is a very very old one it you.
Definitely do not want to use a new one.
That is for sure because this is full.
Coverage and i can guarantee you you're.
Gonna have to throw this out after this.
Video trust me then i'm gonna grab the.
Krylon t paint stick in the shade at.
Zerozero this one is already just pure.
White and i'm gonna use this to.
Highlight my face starting off right in.
The center in between the brows just.
Like that that i'm going to do one line.
Oops the nose huh we'll get her there.
I'm just gonna put this in the same.
Place that i always put my concealer.
Except this is just white as opposed to.
Normal shades and then once again just.
Gonna bond that in with a beauty blender.
If you're watching this video i feel.
Like it's probably safe to assume that.
At least most of you guys have seen the.
Show or at least heard of the show.
Rupaul's drag race.
Literally when my favorite shows in the.
Entire world and if you don't know what.
It is and is a drag queen tv competition.
Show hosted by the legendary rupaul and.
This season has been so beyond.
Entertaining and crazy whereas his.
Favorite slava discussion down the.
Comments below aquaria literally love.
Her the most i've been following her.
Since she had like 30,000 followers on.
Instagram and now she's on season 10.
Which is so crazy she actually do my.
Makeup two years ago when i was in new.
York for i think generation beauty which.
Is a baby beauty convention and it was.
So cool meeting her and just seeing her.
Progression i literally love her makeup.
So today's look is deathly gonna be.
Heavily influenced by aquaria i also.
Love eureka i'd not heard personally a.
Few times and she is literally one of.
The sweetest people ever in the entire.
Oath and i think she deserves every.
Single ounce of her success she is so.
Funny and we definitely need a bigger a.
Winner i think it's time so my fingers.
Are crossed for her definitely the.
Season i also live for when i exchange.
This entire season all from the sponges.
To british accent oh just loved it the.
Most we stay on for this tutorial i.
Wanted to sing a little bit different i.
Have actually never done ever but also.
Never in a job tutorial and i want to do.
My eyebrows all my face is still wet and.
Not powdered i see a lot of different.
Queens doing this a lot of we start off.
With their eyebrows first can't do that.
Still a little bit too spooked and.
Clearly i have to cover mine but i wanna.
Try to go into the cream product i'm.
Going to use the anasazi a dip brow and.
I'm just gonna sketch the man and then.
Set powder over top hopefully we're.
Gonna have to say my hand is shaking.
Hello.
I hate drawing and eyebrows.
I'm not like that eyebrow dry eyebrows.
As a directory is so hard like oh this.
Is the research alan turing oh no it's.
Taking out my foundation underneath my.
Eyebrow what the heck.
Yes okay this is kind of a wash roughly.
I literally don't understand how drag.
Queens cover their eyebrows and then can.
Draw on new eyebrows and have it look.
Like smooth and not crusted i am pretty.
Good at broad cover at this point but no.
Matter what like something always still.
Looks so wrong when i clean that up that.
Could be usable oh that's an ugly.
Eyebrow how do people do this.
That is way too large like why is that.
All the way up there it's like all the.
Way on my forehead i hate this what's.
Going on.
Okay these literally look the worst but.
You know what that's we have concealer.
For and thank god that i do not set.
These in place because now i'm gonna.
Grab some shape tape and a mac 242 brush.
A lot of shaved tape but i'm gonna go.
And clean up these brows.
Music.
Oh see the hustle whoa man that's a.
Woman mm-hmm okay we love her concealer.
Whoo no this one on the other hand oh.
She's the struggle sister it's always.
The eyebrows that get me good every time.
I'll be good again.
All right so literally 45 minutes later.
And no i'm not kidding.
Wish i was but hope brows are now on and.
Even so what i'm gonna do is just go in.
Quickly and blend out any creases that i.
Gathered underneath my eyes while crying.
Over my brows looking horrible then it's.
Gonna take a dent powder puffs in some.
Kody or some powder whoo and i'm gonna.
Set my entire face including my brows.
With this let's see if this works okay.
So far so good.
This took 60,000 euros i think i.
Actually like this technique of doing my.
Brows while the creams are still wet a.
Lot more than drawing them on later on.
Thanks sister asha i'll definitely be.
Doing this okay so now that the face is.
All set and locked right in place we.
Have to a contour and contour is a very.
Very vital step to drag makeup i mean.
That you have to go from a brother to.
His sister so we definitely do add a lot.
More dimension and back to the face so.
I'm gonna grab my morphe m55 4 brush and.
The anasazi a contour kit and dip into.
At the lightest shade right up in here.
And just add this right over the same.
Places that i put the white highlight.
Earlier gonna pop this right oh okay i'm.
Actually gonna take the jeffree star.
Cosmetics blood shook her eye shut up.
Hello and dip into the shade glucose.
Which is literally just a white.
Eyeshadow with the same exact brush but.
I know that this white is very very.
Pigmented so i'm gonna use a little bit.
Of it to highlight the center of my face.
I was gonna place the shade right.
Underneath my eyes right up against my.
Nose contour to brighten up the center.
Oh why should he use the k'kaw powder.
I'm gonna grab the k'kaw beauty.
Brightening powder and the shade number.
1 and the same exact brush to use that.
To highlight my face instead and then.
We're gonna go back into the augusta's.
Their contour kit and i'm going to use.
My morphe m 405 and use this to chisel.
On my face i'm sorting right at the top.
Of my ear right in my sideburn region.
And doing a circular motions going right.
Down and i'm kind of keeping this.
Contour a little bit higher than i would.
Normally go for more of a feminine.
Lifted at cheekbone type look.
Yeah just like that pretty we love.
Same thing on the other side definitely.
Need to really chisel out my five head.
As well.
And when contouring i'm kind of blending.
In it like a circular motion if that.
Makes sense we're like the lightest.
Point being right here and then kind of.
Fading out circular ombre sunset.
Situation into a very very dark hairline.
Of course you have to also snap to the.
No so i'm just going to grab my benefit.
Hoola bronzer and dejay tear eighty one.
Eighty from luck see beauty dual ended.
Nose contouring brush good lord you guys.
Know i live for a good snatched nose and.
Drag queens honestly we're definitely a.
Huge inspiration for me when it came to.
Learning how to in nose contour and.
Highlight my nose to really look so.
We're gonna make it look even more.
Pinched than usual and once that.
Contours on then i'm gonna grab that.
K'kaw brightening powder and the beauty.
Blender once again and i'm actually.
Gonna press this right into at this side.
Of the nose contour to really snatch it.
Right up and to give that perfect.
Illusion mm-hmm look at her she's sister.
Snatched to really finish off and.
Brighten that nose i'm gonna take the.
Nyx jumbo eye pencil in the shade milk.
This is the pure white one i am scared.
To do this but once again i've seen a.
Lot of different queens do this so.
Hopefully this will work first mr.
Genius and i'm gonna put a little dollop.
Right on the tip.
Music.
You're kidding.
Hello either worked and lasted finally.
Not least for the bass i'm just gonna go.
To my mac peaches blast you guys all.
This is my all-time favorite on my.
Morphe e for brush and give myself an.
Actual for once really decent coverage a.
Blush you guys know i don't usually like.
A lot of blush in my looks but when it.
Comes to drive we do have to make the.
Highlights and the contours a lot more.
Intense so blushes are really nice job.
Of marrying everything together for a.
More soft but still intense look so.
Finally the base is done we get to move.
On to the eyes thank the lord but i do.
Want to do one last thing before we do.
And that is a bake our face to really.
Intensify the highlights even more so.
I'm gonna grab a little bit more of the.
Cody harrison powder in my damp beauty.
Sponge center it's going to bake okay so.
Let's move right ahead with the eyes at.
The first palette i want to go in with.
The city is the jeffrey's top balai de.
Sugar eyeshadow palette and i'm gonna.
Grab the shade glucose first which is.
This white shade right up here and use.
This to highlight the brow bone this is.
By far one of the most pigmented.
Eyeshadows i have ever used and i.
Definitely want to give the brown one a.
Good highlight to kind of lift.
Everything up next i'm gonna grab a big.
Fluffy brush this is the morphe m4 for.
One use cody's for ten percent off and.
Dip into the shade out and just use this.
As a light transition shade i'm gonna.
Pop this color right above the crease.
And just blend this up right into the.
White just to give a nice wash of color.
And to get the eye makeup started i'm.
Next gonna switch over to the morphe 39.
A palette this is the palette that i.
Actually modeled for for the morphe.
Holiday collection unfortunately it is.
Now sold out and gone for good but.
Basically i'm just gonna be using cool.
Toned brown shadows today so use any.
Palette that has similar shades using a.
Fluffy crease brush i'm gonna dip into.
This shade right over here and i can use.
Just to deepen up the crease a little.
Bit i'm just using little circular.
Motions to really build up a color once.
Again staying right above that natural.
Crease line because we're gonna make our.
Eyes look way bigger then going a.
Smaller pointed fluffy brush this is the.
Morphe m 506 i'll get a dip into this.
Dark brown shade right up in here and.
Use that to really deepen elephant it's.
Going back into my big fluffy brush i'm.
Going to blend that out a little bit and.
Make sure that doesn't look too harsh.
Now that we have our crease shadow all.
Laid out and nice and blends and i'm.
Gonna take a white concealer this is the.
La girl pro concealer in the shade white.
Obviously hello and a mac 242 brush and.
Just cut out.
Crease perfect wow cool once again good.
A dip back into that murphy m 2 2 4 and.
The caloocan shade from the blood sugar.
Pellet and then set that white in place.
I do add a little bit of sparkle and.
Glow to the lid so i'm gonna grab this.
Stila liquid metals in the shade of.
Perlina and put this over the white area.
That i just set in place then before.
That sets in place i'm gonna pack on the.
Mixed glitter in the shade mgl io5 and.
Then to be really active before we go.
Ahead and add the winged liner i want to.
Do one last step and that is gonna be to.
Glue on some individual sourav ski.
Crystals.
I learned this trick from and naomi.
Smalls and always look so stunning from.
Far away the crystals just sparkles so.
Beautifully on the lid so i'm gonna pop.
A few on it just using lash glue and.
Tweezers so next up in the eyes is going.
To be the way nat  like outer shadow.
Moment and i try to do this technique in.
My coachella festival makeup store but.
It did not work at all so we're gonna.
Try again today fingers crossed.
I know aquaria does this all the time in.
Her looks and it always looks the best.
So i need to have faith myself but i'm.
Gonna take just a light piece of.
Cardboard i hey i'm miss laura lee this.
Is from her pr package and just a fluffy.
Brush and dip into a block i shadow.
Wish me luck tap off the excess and i'm.
Gonna place this card right here on my.
Face right up against my on i'm gonna.
Press it very firmly into my skin and.
Then i'm just gonna go right in and.
Start blending the block right up.
Against our blending on at the edge.
Blending in the crease just making sure.
It looks like nice and not super super.
Harsh then before i remove that i'm.
Gonna take a blending brush from before.
They had the brown on it and go over.
This edge right here and then when i.
Remove that yeah work this time we have.
A nice and defined black line oh thank.
God okay great thanks laura lee and i'm.
Gonna continue this block right down.
Into the corner of my eye to prepare to.
Bring it into the lower lash line in a.
Second.
Once a black shadows on that i'm just.
Gonna go to the black liquid liner and.
Just line right up against that.
Waterline just when we put on lashes.
There's no like weird shadow moments so.
That is the top lid all complete huh a.
Lot goes into drag makeup as you can see.
But let's go to move on to the bottom.
Lower lash line which will be a whole.
Lot easier.
Think on i'm first gonna shout wrecking.
That nyx jumbo eye pencil in milk once.
Again and lining my lower lash line then.
When they get to the inner corner.
Instead of following my natural eye.
Shape i'm kind of extending that white.
Down a little bit to kind of follow.
Straight forward and out once again i'm.
Gonna set that white in place using the.
Glucose single shadow from the blood.
Sugar palette next to begin the shadow.
Portion i'm just gonna dip into the same.
A block that i used for the upper lash.
Line top off the access and be super.
Careful i'm going to blend this right.
Along the lower lash line connecting the.
Wing right up in the outer corner and.
Then using a small fluffy crease brush.
Is the morphine i'm a 4-3-3 i'm gonna.
Dip into that same cool tone a brown.
Transition shade from before and just.
Blend right underneath the crease and.
Into the inner corner and last but.
Finally not least to complete the eyes.
Today i thank the lord in heaven above.
Is going to be the lashes and for.
Today's look we have bam the three oh.
Ones if you are a true drag fan you know.
That these are like the best of the best.
They are intense but they look so.
Stunning and when you have this much eye.
Makeup on you have to match it with a.
Good and fresh lash so all i did was.
Stock any regular pair of lillie lashes.
In the style i believe miami you guys.
All those my all-time faves and i use.
Those because they held a little bit of.
A lift to them and just glued a 301.
Right over top and i'm gonna pop that on.
My lash line for a very very 3d and.
Lifted and beautiful stunning look i.
Usually like to apply my lashes kind of.
In the middle but for these i'm actually.
Gonna push on the inner corner of the.
Lash first being that that is by far the.
Most important part to this look and i'm.
Gonna take the outer corner of the lodge.
And lift it out to make sure that it's.
On the regular lashes and they're gonna.
Place it down but what i actually put.
This lash there i'm not gonna put the.
Lash on my lash line i'm actually gonna.
Put it a little bit above my natural.
Lash line which is going to lift my.
Entire eye upwards obviously this is.
Totally optional not gonna lie it does.
Feel a little bit weird to have your.
Lash glue.
Of your eyelid but it really does help.
And give the face a little bit of a.
Lifted look and then also since the area.
Is fully covered in eyeliner you can't.
Even tell and it's a full-on illusion.
And finally just gonna pop on a little.
Bit of my favorite mascara to blend.
Together my fake lashes with their.
Really large big quads helpful hand too.
If you're like me and you have a pretty.
Long bottom lashes and you decide to do.
This like white in a corner moment like.
I have right here when you're applying.
Your mascara especially to the lashes in.
The bottom corner be really careful and.
Pay attention to where you're actually.
Holding the wand because you should try.
To avoid putting mascara right at the.
Root on the inner corner and only get.
The mascara on the kind of second half.
Of the lash if that makes sense and keep.
That first half of the lash white from.
The eye liner because then it keeps that.
Illusion going of the white inner corner.
With the black mascara underneath.
Because if you get black mascara all the.
Way up to the root in this inner corner.
Right here it's gonna try to get away.
From that illusion i just like i have on.
This lash but you get what i mean.
Hopefully all three sisters and finally.
That is what i all complete i am.
Literally loving how this is hurting cal.
So far i'm gonna go ahead and do the.
Other one off camera quickly and i'll be.
Right back to finish off with rosenblum.
Okay so those are both eyes all complete.
And i was a little bit worried about.
This look at first not gonna lie i've.
Never really confident in my full job.
Looks until they come together but now.
Oh my god i am really loving this i.
Really i just wrapped aquarius face.
Right over and just popped it right on.
Wide and i am loving i feel beautiful.
So let's go ahead and move on our next.
Was going to be the glow i'm bursting my.
Skin a good spread to the max like plus.
Being that i've literally put on 64.
Million pounds of makeup and powder and.
My skin's feelings love it dry but.
Highlighter today i'm going to dip into.
My fave dattara top yot pressed pigment.
And i'm gonna pop that right on it the.
High points of my face ready for this oh.
Oh yeah there she is girl that of course.
Is having a pencil brushes in the m-43.
One i'm just gonna pop that right over.
The sister asha notched schnoz.
Music.
For the lips today i definitely feel.
Like i go with the nude when it comes to.
Draw it looks a lot so i don't want to.
Do that and for today's look i want to.
Do a really really bright red so i'm.
Going to use the kylie boss lip liner to.
Outline them first and we have to over.
Line of course then i'm just gonna fill.
This then using the matching carly.
Liquid lipstick eraser so we are all.
Done and the last of the day is going to.
Be it to lock this face in place so your.
Performance and season 11 ready i'm.
Gonna use a skin to navy up makeup.
Finishing spray just myself a pretty.
Heavy spread all right babe so that is.
