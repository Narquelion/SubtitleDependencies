Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel as.
You guys can see today i'm joined with a.
Very very special guest.
Professional cosmetics competition judge.
Yes you turn this about you or i am.
Literally so excited to finally have you.
Here this club i feel like is bad i.
Think we have discussed for like years.
Now a long word so those of you guys who.
May not know we're about to find out.
Trixie is literally in my opinion.
Probably the best drag queen in the.
Entire world.
Routledge a great seasons have been a.
Winner of all-stars season 3 and also.
Now professional guest judge a yes.
Piranha and ceo of checks to cosmetics.
Music.
Its influence are airing every single.
Friday right here streaming for free on.
My channel every tuesday i'm uploading a.
Fun video that somehow ties back to the.
Last episode and if you guys saw it.
Which if you've not make sure you click.
Right up here because there will be no.
Alerts in today's video we challenged a.
Contestants to do their ultimate drive.
At transformation doing drag is not easy.
And do direct for the first time at a.
Competition i mean that is not no those.
People were struggling but a lot of them.
Really did it turn it out so for today's.
Video.
I thought it'd be really fun at 4 tricks.
Tonight to sit down together and do our.
Ultimate drive transformations i know.
That there's probably people that are.
Like matha that you're not transforming.
Me but i feel like you've done so many.
Trips to transformations at this point.
Yeah only i'm not my makeup on other.
People we all look exactly the same.
That's great it's such a signature like.
Damn thing every time so that'll be it.
Much more fun to just get ready together.
In drag do our own ultimate drug.
Transformations talk all about to try.
Grace the different shows you've worked.
On it into influencer behind the scenes.
T from the show and so much more so if.
You guys want to see us go from this to.
This and then we're exactly the same.
Keep on hunting.
Music.
You clean your brows down yeah i don't.
Know this you didn't have to snap so.
Hard pop off why did you say that what.
Is that problem i'm just very young and.
I like i like i say a lot of young.
Things i will say when i got to judge.
Innocent but it when i got to judge on.
Instant influencer it was exciting but i.
Had to judge after paris hilton so it.
Was a little bit like oh you know paris.
Hilton was just here she is so yeah but.
Your check secret oh yeah but i was so.
Jealous she was there the day before me.
Like oh okay to be honest i literally.
Love paris but do you were honestly.
Probably the guest judge that i was most.
Excited about.
I got the opportunity to work with.
Because i wrote alice i have met before.
And i've gotten to work with before you.
Were like kind of the one person that i.
Have like loved and respected and looked.
Up to for so long i'd like deanne back.
And forth like a few times and stuff but.
Never really got the opportunity to.
Actually like murk on a project together.
Building was so much fun for me but i'd.
Be completely lying if i said that like.
Being on set wasn't also really.
Stressful because it was like 14-hour.
Days for me so you yeah being on set.
Made me smile so hard and made me laugh.
The entire time and like made ian.
Experience so enjoyable so she does her.
Own makeup who you oh i don't know if.
People know that you put your own makeup.
On the show yeah always who why to be.
Judging a makeup competition if i can't.
Even do my own makeup t there we go and.
Also i was so excited to do it because.
I'm not like a tv watcher i'm a like.
Digital media consumer i'm upset i mean.
Everything i love is from youtube so.
Especially since it was a youtube.
Original i was like this is my hbo time.
Young i am only 30 but i know that in.
This room that means 50 okay i normally.
Don't even do this i just want to feel.
Included i want to talk about the first.
Time that we met it was at the movie.
Premiere for than 9.
Applause.
Music.
Like i said i was literally like the.
Biggest fan of you i like sat down and.
Like heard you talking behind me does it.
I was so scared to even look back.
Because i let me thought that you hated.
Me well i didn't help that i got really.
Close to here and said well it was.
Because of the fandom drama that had.
Started because oh right the show what.
That mean my little brother had on.
Youtube yeah also i mean listen i didn't.
Invent editing i didn't invent two.
People sitting on a chair talking if.
Some drama that may or may not be real.
Gives you something fun to discuss over.
A roll of froot loops i'm happy for you.
I don't need to talk to the president of.
Being canceled but i would love to be.
Just canceled me mom i'm so scared of.
The color that i chose to put on myself.
Yeah what okay i know doesn't look that.
Breezy i got really burn in the sun i'm.
Gonna listen it's okay to go darker here.
When you go lighter here right we're.
Gonna later that's all right don't worry.
With the show thing like literally it.
Was so crazy to you that that started.
Such a like war in between my fans and.
Yours because literally like people knew.
That i was the biggest fan of you and.
Like we talked about it and the episode.
Be like yeah this is inspired by oh this.
Is so crazy.
Didn't chris edit it yes okay the guy.
Who edited that was originally an editor.
On on so like we hired at the original.
Artists which i definitely think a.
Support like we had people that were.
Offering to like try to replicate it but.
I was like you know if we're gonna do.
This sound inspired by that i'm like i.
Want to pay the original person who like.
Did it you know yeah by the way speaking.
Of inspiring you know confident i get to.
Use this every single day oh god do you.
Really yes because what's like a dm.
Getting a drag usually and she is not.
That like her relationship with makeup.
Is completely utility based if you can.
Get ready fast and easy she likes it.
Okay i have a fun question for you i.
Love fun after being on drag race season.
7 and then winning all stars 3 i know.
That you said you never wanted to.
Compete in like again yeah now that.
You've also judged into influencer do.
You like competing or judging better.
Chachi.
Oh my controversial opinion.
Plugs on you because you don't like the.
Judges they do nothing they do not lies.
They're lit well and they're giving.
Their opinion of others but competing is.
So anxiety-ridden yeah i am such a.
Competitive person that like you are yes.
Would you ever do a competition yes what.
Would you do my issue is like like.
Amazing race i want to do so bad it is.
Something about yelling for loud boy.
Sticks ayah text you that i wanted you.
To be a guest on the show uh-huh.
And i was so excited that you wanted to.
Do it i want to know what were your.
Expectations of an influencer before.
You've out there oh this is really good.
Question what were you thinking after.
You finished and now what do you think.
Now that you've seen the episode it was.
Filmed at the youtube original space.
Look at the youtube space which is like.
A whole day airport hangar right yeah so.
It's huge she was really really.
High-quality like he said your story is.
Not interesting i love that you've been.
Sadly one of the only queens to really.
Embrace youtube for a contest i mean.
Especially like with um i owe everything.
To that show right and everything to the.
Fact that people watch my show on the.
Internet so like especially when i.
Started producing more beauty content.
But kind of like making it which by the.
Way my channel is just trixie mattel as.
Well it's like how can we marry beauty.
Content but make it really comedy.
Content you know what i mean yeah i mean.
Even my channels like it's makeup at the.
End of a but like it's so much more.
Idiocy i'm so horrified how my face is.
Looking right now i'm looking incredible.
You really are your favorite drug means.
You don't have to say me but it would be.
Love honestly you like that's being done.
Un but aside from you bianca del rio.
It's like hilarious the funniest person.
Ever like it's so clear how hard she.
Works i mean honestly this season has.
Been in my opinion one of the best.
Seasons of darger's ever really are you.
Living i really like it i also love gg.
This season you guys think you look like.
Yes like i've gotten so many people that.
Are really oh you look like this person.
You look like this person and it's never.
Accurate i truly do see it with gg.
Especially when i've been trying.
Well this eyebrow actually looks.
Sickening but i can't i'm not gonna get.
The other one to map what are you using.
Like a dipper no just a powder.
She gives you this look what do you do.
Music.
You look even in the monitor of a girl.
You can't go by me i don't know what i'm.
Doing you can always go in and clean it.
With my life same that's it.
Bye thanks for watching does my look is.
Actually how was kind of a throwback we.
Saw each other outside of drag con two.
Years ago and me and kimchi were like.
Sitting on a sock no wig on my krottas.
And then you came around the corner in.
That white gown how was your drag calm.
It was so fun it's look if you guys.
Never been a drag con it really is.
Disneyland i mean it's crazy.
It was so fun i had the best experience.
Cuz like i had done transformations i.
Have done the makeup i've done the wigs.
And stuff but like i have never been.
Like how to coerce it before that i had.
Never like actually the house like a.
Full you know the full moment but i also.
Got to meet so many queens that i have.
Been looking up to forever i'm either.
Meeting people or i'm doing the press so.
I'm like just go on right if you want to.
Meet trixie you have to cut through a.
Line of 100 teenage girls and they will.
Kill you mmm don't get me started on.
Cutting the lines at our club you know.
People heard people still to this day.
Bring that up about me still would you.
Like to clear the air yes i would love.
To clear the air so two years ago i got.
Invited to go to drakon and i was.
Supposed to do a meet and greet this is.
What i held like a million followers i.
Think and i woke up that morning feeling.
Like really nauseous just like it was.
00 in.
The morning to get into full drag to.
Then go in and for five people so later.
On that day like right when it's about.
To end i notified like the team that i.
Was working with and i was like hey i.
Would really still love to go and just.
Pop in like how i still go oh my gosh.
Yes of course like we'd love to have you.
And i got there and started getting mom.
Like it was like crazy so as soon as i.
Got there they gave me a full security.
Team to walk me around i wanted to see a.
Few different drag queens itself and the.
Security team that was with me brought.
Me to the front of the lines so i could.
Meet the queen's get a photo and get out.
And listen i get it like even i like.
Don't like honey lyons but the reality.
Is you have to be saved but you have to.
Be smart so they wanted to get me in and.
Get me out because the da is gonna start.
A problem like that it's when kids start.
Lining up or asking for photos or.
Crowding and then that's when the people.
In line get angry that some people get.
Hurt some people get trampled and it was.
Never.
Attention to her anybody or to make.
Anybody feel lost data but still doesn't.
Say that scandal follows me around the.
Drug community i've heard that before.
Too so they are three years later i.
Still do not think that i'm superior to.
Anybody i don't think time superior to.
Drive me literally to seeing it to get.
And james charles at drag con punched a.
Teenager confirmed oh i mean that 40 on.
Say is quaking you know what the t of.
Quarantine is too cocky now because i've.
Been doing the youtube videos and then.
Filming with katya it is really an odd.
Feeling to get in drag and not leave.
Your house really yesterday i was like i.
Had to film during the day and then i.
Had a stream at night sick sitting and.
Full drag at my kitchen dining room.
Table eating a salad like a normal.
Person like it was weird to be in drag i.

With kotti i'm like ah because people.
