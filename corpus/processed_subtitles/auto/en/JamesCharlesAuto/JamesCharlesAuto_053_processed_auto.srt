In her face on to lie are you guys ready.
To see james charles fair arrived and.
You want to see the completed look make.
Sure you would keep on watching so you.
Just went ahead and be covered by a.
Brows and sideburns off camera a very.
Very lengthy process for like all drag.
Queens mascara whereas her shaved off so.
First things first we're actually gonna.
Color correct the brows and the.
Sideburns is it actually the cover fx in.
The color brick it's amazing i've gone.
Through like five of these i wanted to.
Shave this morning i might be right back.
I think to always see where i hate.
Before it when i wake up all because.
Mine is notorious for run straight.
Through makeup will wear - since we're.
Covering its brows were actually don't.
Want to really like high coverage.
Foundation stick this is the prime on tv.
Paint stick.
Music.
So right now america's using a beauty.
Blender and blending out this crazy and.
Awesome.
Brown and cyber color we have ait's a.
Really light foundation for this just.
Because it's the only penalty it means.
That i have we needed that full coverage.
To cover up everything because sister.
Got a lot of hair up in here.
Perfect okay so now that the song.
Foundation and today we're he's the.
Information that i have never used.
Before the giorgio armani luminous so.
Much i'm so excited to watch so before.
We get any comments as well i did get a.
Spray tan because i'm going on a very.
Exciting a beach vacation in a few days.
You guys watching this now will have.
Already seen it because the city will.
Not be enough for a few weeks by spray.
Tan and we have this melanie mills of.
Hollywood colima body stuff oh my god my.
Mind is very vague like radiating from.
My family it's so beautiful it's like a.
Bronze guys so that is why my foundation.
Is a little bit darker to say these days.
Open up my face so i don't any comments.
About it about take the face to the neck.
Like you're supposed to there anything.
There so x are what we're going to go.
Into another foundation we're so crazy.
You know there's some people that mix.
Like three or four foundations like good.
Luck i've never made some asia this is.
The marc jacobs remarkable it's no more.
What if it covers a function like no.
One's business i think that's actually.
Enough to cover the whole entire face if.
Your games i made it in the light.
Coverage like up straight is a model of.
The brows well yeah.
Music.
Everybody actually mixed a little.
Mixture of like midnight powers.
My treat banana powder and then some.
Laura mercier powder a little bit of.
Like white powder and a little bit of.
Chestnut powers to kind of like a little.
Bit some colors yeah that's a trick that.
I picked up early on my drag career.
So tell me what was like to have a short.
Race it was so weird.
Honestly like yeah i'm love me too so.
When we when i walk to the workroom i.
Was like i had i was going to say like.
Hi mom or something funny like that but.
All i could think was like oh my god.
Like this is what it looks like it felt.
Like i jumped into my tv screaming can.
You imagine james for every season.
Season to be on the show okay guys now.
I'm gonna go on my next step and i told.
James i was gonna do this he like.
Freaked out he was like what the heck.
That's so against the world i'm very.
Very nervous so basically a baritone.
That she's going to be putting my.
Concealer on even though she already.
Powder with other eyes yeah if you are a.
Fan our beauty gurus and youtuber people.
You know this is like rule number one.
That you never ever apply well they.
Never said not to i think they.
Definitely have said that i've never.
Seen someone say that's a cool number.
One you don't put up the codes are.
Creative schoolboy but we do it all the.
Time we glue our brows down oh well i.
Guess so this is the tarte maracuja.
Maracuja never when i will say that i've.
Been using this for years.
Maracuja creaseless concealer i swear by.
It i know they have a new concealer out.
That everyone's raving about i have a.
Try.
I'm sure all of it if i love this one so.
Much but here we go.
So how long have you been in jaguar i've.
Been doing drag for five years now yeah.

Okay we here on the day of trial channel.
We love sister heaven itself i'm gonna.
Make a little mixture again where i'm.
Gonna actually do a little bit of our.
Original mixture but then put more of.
The laura mercier and a queen of mixing.
I like to start with little tiny amounts.
The powder first and then obviously.
Build cuz i feel like if you put too.
Much on too fast it'll crack and be.
Campion like ruin your day.
So pharoah's you do a little sugar pill.
Talk about my bra.
You have girls are still very good job.
And very very hairy because a lot girls.
Up in here a lot of rails we want like.
The best coverage possible so this.
Shadow is doing a fantastic job of.
Adding a little bit extra white hasn't.
There truly well how they end up using.
This one here i led to because i love a.
White car crazy.
Music.
This is in the color pinch of peach i.
Just love a pink blush honestly truly i.
Don't like orange questions i don't like.
Dark brook i just pink blush it all i.

We're going to go onto my honest i'll.
See where pills locate and glean we're.
Gonna highlight him before we bake so.
Ferris heli is obviously like while.
She's no curtains are pictures oh every.
Single    time but i wanted to oh.
Good thing i'll have to talk to my.
Hospital because i just lost my vision.
So we went in a starburst first and now.
We're gonna go in with crushed okay okay.
Guys we're gonna go to xml we're going.
To my favorite eyeshadow of all time if.
You are actually a follower of mine you.
Know that this is like my favorite.
Eyeshadow i just give it a shot up all.
The time it's sugar pill dolly pop.
You're so strong i admire you so much.
For being strong through it thank you i.
Had some paid during the myspace days.
And like almost killed me but we're.
Leaving your back dude i have a very.
Very thick skin i just try to think like.
Stay positive and something and chennai.
Out may be a stupid mistake that.
People get mad or i like to sit back and.
Just take a look at the situation in see.
Like heineken or ever thought of myself.
As a person i know that's the only thing.
You come to kind of see i approach it.
There's no time machines yet and you.
Can't take things back so at that point.
Like it was can you do besides to learn.
It just better yourself in the situation.
You know well yeah and a lot of people.
That want to criticize you right now.
Honestly if they people dug up what they.
Said on twitter they're 12 years old.
Everyone is problematic looking like.
Everybody has that things.
They would not publicize it's just my.
Rock your type.
Yeah like i wasn't on the hot end.
Tonight because i said it and they were.
Stupid they were literally ignorant but.
I think nobody should really be like.
Judged on what on things that they said.
So long like anything can happen they.
Can change somebody like so they can.
Have an atar oh that could be you know.
What i'm mostly a different person here.
Last night circulate nobody should be.
Judged on what they selling even like a.
Year ago alone four years ago the fact.
That anything was that at four years ago.
Is not an excuse because it doesn't make.
It okay but i feel like nobody should be.
Judged for what they said so longer.
Because people change and trust me a lot.
Of people agree with you on that know.
That we finished the liner let's go in.
And cut that crease a little bit of the.
Black eyeshadow yeah we had to move.
Positions because i could not get over.
There and do it at the same all it was.
Really hard cut ready to cut and we're.
Going to continue on a limited audience.
Hopefully with just to get supplies.
Other girls makeup.
I mean honestly that's why i did it no.
Rightly i would assume so we're gonna.
Actually go into some jeffree star drug.
Lord i like to do this with like the.
Little white liner right there i've.
Never actually tried this on the lip but.
I love it as a liner.
I got this time for brows guy i feel.
Like so nervous because you're like the.
King of promise.
Give me parables that's what you're.
Talking about on twitter all the time.
Like i wish that maybe just one time in.
My life that's symmetrical eyebrow i.
Feel like i do drive i can like to slay.
The face and the conjurer eyes.
I think that's harsh muted brows really.
I don't like it because my brows i'm so.
Used to like the very very straight like.
You know arch type of shape like so it's.
Very very hard don't care if i did this.
Off camera because it's like they can't.
Answer your sister i know but they they.
Can make it rhetorically answer and you.
Watch it because it okay we're gonna.
We're gonna do the other about.
Off-camera also at 17 hours the other.
Brow like i said my brows are never.
Symmetrical they're never even give me a.
Break i'm not like missing just be.
Laughs okay they might look a little.
Better after i clean it up of this so.
This next step i do i take a kind of.
Like a taupe color eyeshadow by thomas.
Aussie beverly hills this is a ash brown.
I always like to take this and this is.
Kind of what i put the hairs in where i.
Think that it's like first i like to.
Line the bottom okay we're going in with.
This um benefit roller lash that's.
What's so cool about these particular.
Hairs is the thing.
Everybody like doll like a little or.
Like a little deer or something you know.
Like oh yeah.
So when i always like to be afraid that.
The lashes on is like go over one last.
Time with the liquid liner because.
Especially with like a white eyeshadow.
It'll always fall and if i'm feeling.
Really extra i'll bring the liquid liner.
To the club you're like crazy i'm so so.
Well i like why would they make them all.
Bring so much with me i always have my.
Beauty blender at much looser stylish.
Royal so it wouldn't be a pheromone look.
Without the little individual bottom.
Lashes so we see we go back in with that.
Amazing industrial house of lashes.
Lashes and i'm really obsessed with and.
We're gonna put the little rhinestones.
As well with this oh my god hang on it.
Has my favorite part so today i did up.
Tutorial few minutes ago using the.
Crystals under the eyes a pretty little.
Detail they have to be swarovski so good.
It's a really nice distraction from the.
Leg up uneven brow is that you and i go.
To brian huh.

Light so nicely are you ready for your.
Lip stains i'm sorry this is my favorite.
