Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel for.
Today today i have something a little.
Bit different and very very fun plan.
That i'm actually so excited for this.
Morning i got up at the crack of dawn i.
Arose for my beauty sleep with a rude.
Alarm awakening but i went to the grove.
Here in los angeles and waited in line.
To get this the brand new iphone acts in.
Case you missed an apple just released.
Two brand new iphones beating the iphone.
8 and the iphone acts i guess they.
Skipped the iphone 9 because two seven.
Eight nine huh anyway regardless the.
Iphone actu the iphone 10 is the.
Brand-new anniversary i have one edition.
And there are a lot of brand new.
Features to this phone that have never.
Been on an iphone before one of the main.
Ones being that the way to unlock this.
As you can see there was no home button.
Is a facial recognition unlock feature.
There's been a lot of different.
Conspiracies about this some people.
Think it's really really dope some.
People think that apple is gathering a.
Facial recognition software to give to.
The government i don't even know what.
The hell is going on but this thing is.
Supposed to open up when i show my face.
To it.
And it's supposed to be really really.
Accurate you guys know that my job is.
That makeup artist so most days also.
Enough like this but a lot of times.
After a good long glam session i'll end.
Up with a even skin tone very very.
Contoured shakes a little bit i mean.
Lowered hairline with the facetune tool.
A good highlight on the cheekbones.
Different eyebrows sometimes we have.
Crazy ass lashes on and sometimes even a.
Wig if it's a toggle as well so i'm.
Definitely very into the art of.
Transforming and pulling out different.
Looks so for today's video we're gonna.
Be using the brand new iphone x and.
We're gonna be applying a whole lot of.
Makeup today and seeing how much makeup.
Can really unpack the iphone x to the.
Point where it won't recognize my face.
Anymore without further ado let's start.
Getting glam and transform as much as.
Possible to see if the iphone will still.
A mock once i glam session is complete.
Also make sure you stay tuned until the.
Very end of this video for to a very.
Very special announcements.
Music.
So before we actually apply any makeup.
Today i'm actually gonna go ahead and.
Set up the facial recognition software.
So i'm gonna go into my settings on my.
Brand new iphone and go into the face id.
And passcode i'm gonna turn on use face.
Indy for iphone unlock and i guess i'm.
Going to have to set my face id so of.
Course i'm going to start this off by.
Using my bare face whoa this lady makes.
My face look so bad.
Face id is messed up i guess it was.
Literally that easy so let's hit done.
And just to touch this out let's go.
Ahead and lock the phone and if i open.
It up hello so i guess i've seen when.
You put your face up to the phone it.
Would automatically open but that is not.
The case as you can see there's a lock.
Icon at the top and when i put my face.
In front of it it recognizes me and then.
It turns to an open lock and then i can.
Swipe up hello and now the phone is open.
This is complicated.
Jessa test is how i have sister anthony.
Here with me as you can see the phone is.
Locked right now come on down i need you.
To hold this up and test it to your face.
And see if the thing changes to unlocked.
No okay thank you so much we love.
Technology hey so now we know that this.
Whole face id thing works for now while.
I have no makeup on let's go ahead and.
Put on a full face of graham transform.
Ourselves and try again at the end and.
See if this thing it still works i'm.
First gonna shot off by applying my.
Makeup from from ultra hd foundation sic.
Don't forget to blend down the neck of.
Course and then i'm gonna grab a beauty.
Blender and blend this all in so based.
On apples information face id works on.
Your facial structure so i guess it's.
Supposed to measure the depth of your.
Face so even though we're gonna be.
Contouring a lot today it really chezza.
Ourselves out and try to fool the camera.
I'm sure that the technology may be.
Advanced enough to actually like do.
Measurements i'm really not sure how.
This stuff works even though it says it.
Does measures distance i'm sure it does.
Measure things as well such as like eye.
Color and skin color obviously the goal.
With your foundation is to get your skin.
Cloud to be as accurate as possible to.
Your normal skin color but for people.
Like me and my face is definitely a lot.
More red than the rest of my body i do.
Have a lot of pimples and a lot of.
Rosacea as well so skin color may affect.
It as well foundation is all apply it.
I'm gonna grab my phone and i'm gonna.
Test this one out.
Still on lock's i'm not gonna get my.
Shake tape concealer in the shade light.
Sand and just highlight my face i'm.
Gonna make sure to make my highlights.
And contours very very very intense.
Today to try my best to fool the system.
I'm actually gonna take the kat von d.
Whiteout concealer as well obviously.
This is in.
Show you white and i'm gonna play those.
To the very high points of my face just.
To once again intensify those highlights.
This for the hell of that i'm gonna go.
Ahead and also try this wall the stuff.
Is on my face unblended still works once.
Again just gonna blend it out using a.
And damp beauty blender oh oh oops i'm.
Still work i'm gonna take my sponge into.
A little bit of laura mercier jeb's is a.
Setting powder to set my face in place.
So it doesn't move around so now that my.
Face is all set in place i'm going to.
Use the kat von d shade and light.
Palette and i'm going to contour the.
Crap out of my face using my morphe m.
405 brush you guys know you can use.
Coded change for 10% off for a few.
Products and i'm really gonna go in.
Intense with this i'm gonna use and mix.
Up the middle and right hand shades.
Obviously i would never instruct on.
Doing a contour this straw i mean if you.
Really want to chill yourself out like i.
Don't blame you girl but i usually go.
More soft contour but today we're trying.
To create a completely false facial.
Structure here let's see if we can.
Really define these cheeks i'm gonna use.
This contour brush and kind of pull it.
Down slightly right in this region as.
Well to create the illusion of a more.
Sunken in cheekbone to see if that will.
Flow as well of course we have to.
Contour the hell out of the forehead but.
Let's be real i do this in all my looks.
Regardless so does a normal step for me.
Then of course we're gonna contour our.
Jaw lines and make sure that the dolan.
Twins aren't quaking i'm gonna contour.
My nose as well using a really really.
Dark powder on a fluffy blending brush.
Oh my that looks the worst we're gonna.
Grab a lighter powder that's really.
Close to my skin tone and put this on.
The sides my nose to really enhance the.
Look of the pinch okay so my faces a.
Little bit just lit out if i do say so.
Myself obviously this is not what my.
Normal makeup looks like i promise if.
You're new to the sisterhood please.
Check out some of my other videos my.
Makeup usually looks a lot better than.
This or at least i hope it does but.
Let's go ahead and try this out.
It's still on locks oh my god.
I'm gonna take a powder puff and we're.
Going to bake the highlights of my face.
To really intensify this even more gonna.
Go right up against the line of the nose.
Contour okay i'm a little bit stuck.
Right now i really thought this is gonna.
Not work a whole lot sooner than it.
Already is and i'm not realizing that.
I'm gonna have to probably go a lot.
Farther into my makeup routine then.
Anticipated so die of the mood to do.
That right now but guys we have to.
Figure this out well my face is baking.
In the oven i'm gonna go to my benefit.
Purse i see my brow pencil in the shade.
At number 4 and to find out my eyebrows.
Who knows if it's not my freakin facial.
Shape maybe my eyebrows will fool that.
Oh you know what while we're at it let's.
Go ahead and try out the brand-new.
Camera on this too because it's.
Apparently supposed to be really oh my.
God i'm scared my pores oh this is like.
Scary good quality okay let's go ahead.
And try to use this as an actual mirror.
Oh you're kidding.
Okay this idea was cancelled alright.
Let's go ahead and see if brows the fact.
This at this point i'm starting to lose.
My hope here.
No oh virtually for this video i.
Honestly did not have high hopes for.
This i thought i was gonna be able to.
Pull this really easily i was gonna do.
My everyday makeup routine for you guys.
But clearly this is not working out as.
Well as i had planned so instead of.
Doing my normal lily lashes miami's i.
Let it go on my three oh ones which is.
You guys know if you are drag fans that.
These are the classic drag lashes they.
Are huge they're very very long and.
They're gonna take out my entire eye but.
Maybe it'll look like a different person.
Okay so this is definitely not the look.
I had intended on going for today but i.
Guess you got to do what you got to do.
So would these lashes applied let's go.
Ahead and blend them together with some.
Mascara i'm going to mix together my.
Real lashes with the fake ones make this.
Look as real as possible despite the.
Fact that i have literal spiders glued.
Onto my eyes right now and we're going.
To test this thing out okay iphone locks.
Oh and this we're really not sure what i.
Can do to make this not work i guess i'm.
Just going to wipe off my bake here and.
Then apply a crazy-ass lip and some.
Highlighter and if that doesn't work.
We're gonna have to take some drastic.
Measures here i'm next gonna take my.
Makeup of our pigment in the shade.
Number 13 this is probably the most.
Blinding highlighter that is in my.
Collection it is the most pigmented and.
Is so so so bright when i do use this i.
Only use the slightest bit i'm gonna pry.
This using my more of um of 501 brush.
You see what i'm talking about here to.
The high points of my face so since none.
Of this work the last step in my makeup.
Routine is always gonna be the lipid you.
Doodahs.
Go for today it's like i'm gonna use the.
Anasazi liquid lipstick in the shade of.
Paint and i'm going to go a little bit.
Crazy with the over lining.
Laughs injections never heard of her.
Let's try this you're kidding.
You've got this is god to be a joke how.
I'm out of makeup tips let's go ahead.
And try a little bit harder here phone.
Oh my god i am so shocked right now.
This is not what i wanted i thought this.
Video is gonna take me five minutes to.
Film i really thought my ass was gonna.
Have apple quaking as soon as i got like.
The nose contour i'm annoyed because not.
Only did i have to put on makeup for the.
Seven times today now i look really.
Stupid and i have places to go after.
This so at this point i'm a little.
Stumped clearly the crazy makeup did not.
Work like i wanted it to the wigs did.
Not work like i wanted them to so my.
Last and final step today is gonna be to.
Try out a photo of myself no apple seems.
The photos do not work you have to be.
Like alive and breathing for the phone.
To recognize you which is great.
Considering my job this ability to post.
Photos myself online so thank god if my.
Phone gets stolen at least on all that a.
Photo can open it up but let's go ahead.
And try out and see the real tape all.
Right so this is my most recent.
Instagram photo i just posted this.
Earlier on today if your true sister.
Will give it a double tap and if you're.
Not following me on instagram.
You should totally do that for a cute.
Very face to him selfies every once in a.
While i promise it is a very very good.
Time come on shameless self-promotion.
But i'm gonna take this photo on.
Anthony's phone and my new iphone x and.
Then hold them right up in front of each.
Other and see if this works.
Music.
Hello she's not working mary wow that's.
Thought after an hour of making herself.
Look absolutely ridiculous all i needed.
To do was hold up a photo of myself in.
Front of it it probably knows that it.
Was facetune harbor okay so that's all i.
Have for this videos today clearly this.
Did not exactly go as i had planned.
Honestly at this point i am really.
Really shook and impressed by the new.
Iphone x facial brush to make facial.
Bracket and honestly at this point i am.
Really really shocked and impressed by.
The new iphone facial recognition.
Software i really did not think i was.
Gonna be this good i thought i would.
Easily be able to crack it at some point.
Throughout this routine the only thing.
We got it with today was the picture.
Which is actually a really really good.
Thing so i'm actually very glad to know.
That my new iphone is super secure if.
