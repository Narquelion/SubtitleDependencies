She's complained because it is too much.
To put covered but she's gonna suck it.
Up and her today's video we're gonna.

I'm gonna stalk my bubble states today.
By moisturizing her skin using the top.
Water cream if you guys have my makeup.
Tips and tricks today from a few weeks.
Ago i talked about the importance of.
Using a moisturizer before at your.
Makeup routine my mom does have more.
Mature skin but we are obviously gonna.
Be putting on a whole lotta makeups.
Today so we really want to make sure.
That all the makeup goes on nice and.
Smoothly and does it look like cakey and.
Textured because that's never the goal.
For friday's you say i'm gonna go into.
The too faced born this way foundation.
You guys know this is my all-time.
Favorite and my mom does have a holy.
Skin it like me as well so this will.
Work really really well with her skin.
Type and like we were saying she does.
Have more mature skin so this is gonna.
Be a full coverage foundation which i.
Would normally not do but sister.
Christie does love a really good a full.
Coverage base right yes and that is.
Because she has it oh sorry.
Did a lot yeah well don't tell the.
Sisters a little bit more about what.
Vitiligo is and how it is kind of like.
Affected you vitiligo is an autoimmune.
Disease and there isn't any cure doesn't.
Hurt and it's not contagious but it is.
Waste spots that continue to increase as.
Years go on but i've learned to embrace.
My spots and love my skin no matter what.
Her putting on a foundation on top of.
That's what i write i also feel more.
Confident when it's covered up oh do you.
Know that i just started using a beauty.
Blender like two weeks ago what i used.
To until two weeks ago just use my.
Finger to put in scared of uh-oh part of.
You for making the transition i actually.
Do like it took me a while to get used.
To it you're so brave.
Thank you very much sorry i successors.
Are sending questions while me and my.
Mom are doing our makeup today it's so.
We can like talk about stories and me as.
A child and all sorts of fun and.
Embarrassing things so let's do that.
I guess scissored you and asks do you.
Think james is more like his mom or his.
Dad and in what ways do you think he is.
Like you james has a very strong.
Personality he always has his dad has a.
Strong person.
Okay so i like you you're kind sometimes.
Excuse me i remember when you were.
Younger you'd go to school and the.
Teachers thought you were the best thing.
Since sliced bread and i'm like are you.
Talking about the same james because you.
Always gave us a run for our money when.
You were younger.
Yep you're very sassy uh-huh nothing is.
Saying but never two teachers uh-huh and.
You're brilliant like your father daddy.
It's very very smart just like you are.
Now definitely did not get the hey smart.
Genes from sister christie i got all the.
Good personality genes that matter and.
You got your looks for me too right good.
Answer.
Okay so you're just like i was a very.
Very spirited child as you always like.
To say so speaking of sister elisa asks.
Can you tell one story of james when he.
Was younger that you just knew who was.
Gonna be me just one story because i.
Have lots of stories oh you did not.
Sleep through the night until you were.
Two and a half years old your.
Pediatrician recommended the ferber.
Method which you let him cry for a few.
Minutes and go in and continue to.
Increase the time so they realize.
They're not gonna get anything from.
Crying and they'll eventually soothe.
Themselves back to sleep on their own.
You were so determined that you.
Continued to scream and i would leave.
The house in my car because i couldn't.
Stand listening to you for i would come.
Back an hour two later and you were.
Still crying and it didn't work for you.
So daddy and i took you to the.
Pediatrician and asked what was going on.
And she said most kids would have given.
Up she said james is not gonna be an.
Easy child to parent but he's going to.
Do great things in life oh she said that.
Really she did wow and she asked what is.
Your favorite memory together with you.
And james spending time on cape cod.
Every summer we would rent a house on.
The cape and hang out on a beach well.
That's not true i couldn't sit on the.
Beach i had a chased after you because.
You literally would go to the different.
People and start chatting with them.
Nearly - now you're contouring my nose.
Meaning to make it look more snatched.
It's not to notice here on the jim shaw.
Youtube channel you have a look at good.
In tiny nose and you definitely give en.
Your nose so rude because i did not get.
That whose nose do you think you have i.
Don't know yeah paloma sleeves is making.
A place i am so excited because now it.
Is finally time for the eyebrows and.
Such as i love my beautiful mother her.
Eyebrows need help.
Oddly she has like three eyebrow hairs.
The ones that are there are like 70.
Miles apart.
I just i'm very very excited about this.
Today we're gonna give her some advice.
And slade and snatched sister brows i.
Can't wait i can't wait i think i put.
Them on nicely when i do i'm not usually.
Taking a brow pencil and draw one line.
I'm not used to having a full brow so.
Clearly i've never had a lot of eyebrow.
Hairs and i never even penciled them in.
Until probably a few years ago ever.
Billy yeah and what a difference.
Eyebrows make yeah they change your face.
They really do i definitely learned that.
From you.
We have my eyebrows are definitely under.
Wet intense transformation for the.
Better on this youtube makeup journey so.
My mom does really have a lot of eyebrow.
Houses artists lee helps us a lot.
Because we have a lot to work with them.
You can kind of put them wherever we.
Want which is great so i'm starting off.
This eyebrow by kind of mapping it out.
So i'm really extending it the front of.
Her brow like a good probably half an.
Inch in your basic eyebrow should start.
Like right outside of the bridge of your.
Nose we're gonna send out a little bit.
Anna making a little bit longer then i'm.
Just calling her natural brow shape and.
Thickness to fill in the rest of the.
And i'm just riding really really light.
Strokes because she does have a blonde.
Hair and we obviously don't want them to.
Look like really really dark brown.
Butter just look wonky when i get to the.
End of the road i'm just extending that.
Brow outwards continuing with that art.
And drawing in a tail at the end to.
Really finish up her brow sheep and to.
Make a complete and full brow yesterday.
When i did your brows i had like a gel.
Would you recommend me using a gel on.
James or not the point of bronto is.
Really to set the brow hairs in place.
And kind of push them in the direction.
That you want them to go once you.
Already have your brows filled add so.
Brown gel is really gonna be more for.
People like me who have a lot of brow.
Hairs and if you do fill them in you.
Want them to all light and like the.
Right direction but for someone like you.
Who doesn't really have as many brow.
Hairs brow gel is definitely not.
Necessary okay now the trick is to make.
The other one look the same way yeah cuz.
Browser they are how does it feel to.
Have two eyebrows they look good.
Actually i'm good wow what a difference.
Some eyebrows make huh yeah really does.
And when i see you next time they're.
Gonna be there okay i can do it a lot of.
Faith trust and some trans powder dust.
For my mom's eye so today i'm gonna use.
The brand new anasazi a soft glam.
Eyeshadow palette just like the name i.
Do want to go with a soft glam look.
Today definitely not gonna get my mom a.
Black smoky eye that is for sure we're.
Just gonna keep it light and natural i'm.
Gonna start with my morphe emma for part.
One brush and dip into the shade and.
Burnt orange and it's gonna place this.
All over her lid for a light wash of.
Color.
My mom does have more wrinkly eyelids.
Which is hopefully okay it just comes.
With having more mature skin i'm just a.
Very very gentle when using these.
Windshield wiper motions making sure not.
To really tug at her eyelid at all.
Because we don't want to create any more.
Wrinkles we just want to get a light.
Wash of color on there very very nicely.
And make sure it is evenly distributed.
And blend it out next time i got my.
Morphe the ab 4-3-3 brush is my all-time.
Favorite crease brush and packing brush.
And i mixed together the shades that see.
Ya.
And rustic and his places on the outer.
Corner.
Music.
Then i'm just gonna go back into my.
Blending brush and go over those edges.
Make sure everything gets nice and.
Blended and buffed out using a flat.
Pocket brush this is miami two to four.
I'm gonna dip into the shade it.
Glistening right here and i'm gonna give.
It a just quick spritz of mac fix+ and.
Pop that right on the lid that was a.
Third different brush for eyeshadow yeah.
Because i'd still use the sponge type.
Thing yes no and don't be saying.
Anything well yeah i mean you still look.
Amazing but you can do your makeup.
Routine in five minutes and i take two.
Hours for my i don't have two hours no.
Yeah most people don't but what a.
Difference the bright products and the.
Right brushes right but you also have to.
Have a technique james you're an artist.
I am not an artist no my applicator.
Works just fine huh.
Next i'm just gonna go this mac two to.
One ass brush it's just a tiny little.
Blender brush and dip it to the.
Slightest bit of cypress umber and i do.
Mean the slightest bit and just put this.
Right on the outer corner just to create.
A little tiny bit of dimension i'm then.
Just gonna go with a mac brown a pencil.
In the shade at chestnut and by my mom's.
Upper waterline she usually uses a black.
Eyeliner but i'm really not a fan of.
Using black when it comes to a softer.
Clamp look and i think that's just using.
A light brown will create a more softer.
More natural look well just what we want.
I'm gonna pull my mom's eyelid up just.
To make sure i'm really getting into the.
Root and base of the lash that is.
Obviously where we want the most color.
And most dimension to make the lashes.
Look more defined and give them more.
Volume and then i'm just going to.
Lightly sketch in a line when we get to.
The outer corner i'm pulling that liner.
Up a little bit not really a fall on.
Away just to give her more dimension and.
To kind of lift her eyes up i'm next to.
Take the tiny pocket brush that actually.
Comes aware that the southland palette.
And all the anasazi palettes and dip.
Into the shade rustic and just lightly.
Buff this right alongside her lower.
Lashline no matter what i shadow look.
I'm going for i think it is really.
Really important to balance out the top.
Lid to the bottom lid my mom does.
However have.
Small eyes so i'm just using a really.
Really light wash the color to add a.
Little bit of dimension but to not close.
Them up because that is obviously not we.
Want i'm next indigo to the pretty.
Vulgar nude liner pencil.
I love the formulation of this and like.
I said my mom does have smaller eyes so.
Using a white earned nude in the.
Waterland is gonna really open them up.
And just make them a pop she also has.
Beautiful bluish green eyes thanks for.
Passing that on to me love my shea brown.
I thought i have going on but it's.
Really gonna make him cough okay so that.
Is actually i've said a look i'll.
Complete like my mom was saying her.
Normal makeup takes her five minutes.
This is just a little bit more of a.
Spicy situation to just brighten up her.
Makeup routine a little bit we literally.
Did this eye look and i think three or.
Four eyeshadow brushes but definitely.
Could have been achieved with a lot less.
If you're just an everyday eye makeup.
Wear and i think this look is beautiful.
And just makes her eyes very much pop so.
Our next step to make our eyes pop even.
More it's gonna be lashing our necks to.
Have my mom curl her own eyelashes how.
Using just a regular what are you doing.
If you're like my mom and you don't.
Really have a lot of lashes thanks dad.
For giving me these ones it's really.
Important to curl your lashes and use a.
Really good mascara to provide a volume.
And more dimension and attention to the.
Eyes for mascara today i'm gonna use the.
Brand new benefit bad gal bang mascara.
This one is really really good and i.
Like the formula a lot and is double.
Luminizing mascara we're just gonna be.
Perfect for people like my mom if you.
Have small eyelashes i'm once again.
Holding my mom's eyelid up to get.
Maximum access to her lashes and i'm.
Starting right at the base of the lash.
And then just wiggling it upwards make.
Sure all the lashes are nice and coated.
And black i'm gonna pop on a pair of.
False lashes today have you ever.
Actually worn fake lashes before never.
Oh my god are they comfortable to wear.
It depends on as you move on correctly.
They definitely are and i'm gonna be.
Really careful to glue them on and.
Definitely trim them to your lashes i.
Really like the style because they are.
Definitely wispy so they're not gonna be.
Too dramatic and they get longer on the.
Outer edge so it's gonna provide a nice.
Shape to my mom's eye before actually.
Gluing this on i'm going to go ahead and.
I'm going to place it on my mom's eyelid.
It just with the sticky material that.
Comes in the.
Look down for me i'm going to kind of.
Measure it to her i like i say my mom.
Does have a very very small eyelids oh.
Yes we have to cut a lot off today it's.
Important to cut your lashes so they.
Flatter your eye shape and the best way.
Possible and also don't poke you and.
Come off all day long.
Wow look so pretty it's beautiful how.
Does it feel.
I think maybe i could get used to it.
It's gonna be a while it feels heavy.
Heavy yeah yeah i can see like there's.
Something welcome to my world i blink a.
Lot to begin with so is that where i get.
My blinking from everybody always come.
Inside videos saying you blink way too.
Much why do you always blanket i'm like.
I have no idea yeah sorry i do it blink.
I didn't okay sir so you can stop.
Complaining and now go comment on her.
Instagram and go harass her for the.
Blinking it's all your involved thank.
You i gave you some good things too but.
Alright sister so that is one eye all.
Complete we're gonna go and do the other.
Off-camera just to say sometime probably.
Doing a whole lot of blinking while her.
At it and we'll be right back to finish.
Off the rest of the look alright guys.
We're back with both eyes all complete.
Let's go ahead and finish up the rest of.
This sister chrystie clam and makeover.
Today the first thing we have to do is.
Wipe away this bake because it has been.
Sitting here for quite a long time now.
And we definitely do not want it to get.
Too baked she's gonna be burnt to the.
Crust from the oven very very shortly.
Don't forget to brush off my thanks for.
This team 5 head up in here after.
Brushing out the powder i'm gonna.
Lightly gave her a spritz of the mac.
Fix+.
Just to kind of melt everything into her.
Skin so nothing looks really really.
Cakey and textured and of course we have.
Our sister fan we're gonna give her a.
Nice dry off okay we have one question.
From sister char and c says what is mama.
Charles as a proudest moment of james.
Would have to be when you graduated high.
School early you were working part-time.
And taking very hard classes still doing.
Youtube videos and makeup looks till.
00 200 in the morning and getting up.
And going to school and taking driver's.
Ed and you graduated with an ear.
Perfect average on top of all that on.
Your plate yeah so that was that was a.
Pretty proud moment thanks mom.
I remember having so many arguments with.
Our family about me graduating early and.
Wanting to move out to california and.
You guys are just like no it's not.
Happening like this is just a hobby.
You're gonna get over this which i don't.
Blame them for because when i was.
Younger i would always do something do.
It for like a month.
And then get bored and move on so i.
Honestly i'm still surprised to the say.
That i still am like loving makeup and.
I'm so so passionate about it but i knew.
I wanted to do this and it literally.
Took me going to the guidance.
Counselor's office without my parents.
Knowing and setting up like my credits.
To graduate early and then me going home.
Once it was all finalized and saying hey.
I'm graduating know the story i'm.
Graduating next week yeah yes but i knew.
I needed to get it done and there was so.
Many arguments about it and nothing was.
Moving and so i took initiative into my.
Own hands.
Imagine but it paid off it worked out.
The way it was supposed to but most.
People who want to be quote-unquote rich.
And famous it doesn't happen it's a.
Dream which is great to have dreams but.
You have to have option b because it.
Doesn't usually happen for most people.
And you had an almost perfect average so.
I assumed you were gonna go to college.
Yeah i know and it worked out again the.
Way it was supposed to but i had a hard.
Time next we're gonna be went to sister.
Christie lepida doodahs what she.
Definitely needs to have it to find but.
They are a little naked aren't they.
Usually wear any kind of lip color.
Really never you know i said when i go.
Out maybe if mom and dad have a date or.
Something date night but on a daily on a.
Daily basis no i.
Okay so it's a special occasion my.
Lashes going i gotta have something okay.
Sort of start by over lighting them.
Using the mac baldy barrett lip pencil i.
Definitely want to overlay them a little.
Bit to give them a little bit more.
Volume a little bit more so you over.
Line them with the pencil yeah okay.
I'm gonna finish them off by filing the.
Remove the oprah look and lipstick in.
The shade of the sow hallo this is my.
All-time favorite and you can use coe.
James for 10 percent 30 coe james for 30.
Percent off there you go get that.
Bargain sisters so the last of our.
Makeup routine today is gonna be our.
Setting spray so this makeup can last.
All day long and so christie can have.
All the boys shaking at hollywood.
Boulevard while she is here here in la.
So i'm gonna give her a good spritz and.
We have one final question as well from.
Sister kingsley and way to end off the.
Video and that is how has james of.
Change on life wow i've learned from.
James with all this going on to for.
Myself to be more confident i'm 51 and.
I'm i don't think i'm as confident as.
You are and you're only 18 so i'm trying.
To learn from you that it's okay to be.
