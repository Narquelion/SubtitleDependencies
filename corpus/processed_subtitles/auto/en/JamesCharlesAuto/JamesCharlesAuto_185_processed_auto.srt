Think a mayan good disguise.
Good we've seen only a few people so far.
Almost all the man figured it out.
Eventually i need to just grow the balls.
And go up to strangers i think.
I'm literally freaking out and i don't.
Know why i i've never been like that's.
All having a video before i don't know.
Why i'm so scared.
I have no problem going up to all these.
Youtubers that i know and trying to fool.
Them but i don't know why i cannot go up.
To some that i don't know right now but.
Normally i feel like if it was me i.
Could go up to anybody this video is.
Getting really deep really fast for some.
Reason which i was not expecting and i'm.
Kind of scared maybe this wasn't the.
Best idea i feel really stupid now kelly.
I don't wanna film anymore no i think we.
Need to go home i think we thought the.
Car was addicted to go home.
So i just got home i just took a shower.
I am now back to regular old sister.
James and today's video took a turn the.
Head i was really not expecting it to.
Take but it's definitely one that i.
Think i want to sit down and talk about.
Before i say anything about what kind of.
Just went on i first want to say a major.
Major thank you - channing judith who.
Was my special effects artist for.
Today's video she is literally so.
Incredibly talented and one of the.
Nicest people i've ever met in the.
Entire world yes of course today's video.
Did not exactly work out like i wanted.
It to but it had a no correlation to the.
Makeup whatsoever at all it was my own.
Personal issues that we'll get into in a.
Second and i just want to say thank you.
To her for taking the time out of her.
Day to make those prosthetics to mold my.
Face to apply that that took five hours.
This morning and it was truly one of the.
Coolest processes and makeup that i've.
Ever been a part of and actually got me.
So into special effects makeup i.
Definitely wanna do more research and.
Learn a lot about it but major shadows -.
Channing and i also want to say a major.
Thank you as well - beautycon for their.
Entire team for not only hooking me and.
My team up with talent passes very very.
Last second and also for letting us film.
That was super super awesome and this.
Concept was something that i really.
Wanted to do was super excited about so.
I was really happy that they were.
Supportive of me as a creator to allow.
Me to do that in their convention today.
All that being said i don't really talk.
About my feelings that often on youtube.
I am very much an open book but usually.
An open book of positivity and.
Creativity and marketing and all sorts.
Of things i've talked about all the time.
In my videos but it's not very often.
That you guys see me being vulnerable.
And the truth is that i don't really.
Like being a vulnerable i myself have.
Never before suffered with anxiety i.
Know a lot about it because a lot of.
Really important people in my life have.
It of course i've been nervous and i've.
Been anxious for different things.
Happening but i've never really suffered.
With true anxiety and today i think what.
I had was an anxiety attack and i'm.
Still really confused about it i'm still.
A little bit shaken up i'm still sister.
Shock there's not.
Time for jokes sorry but that's just how.
I cope with these type of things and i.
Just wanted to sit down and kind of talk.
To you guys about it because for the.
Past two or so hours on the way home.
From beautycon to getting on transformed.
To then taking a shower including myself.
Up i've been thinking a lot about why.
Today went how it did and how i feel.
About it.
And i think i've actually been able to.
Successfully kind of like really dig.
Into why i was sort of nerve-wracking.
And i just wanted to talk to you guys.
About it in case anybody else has a.
Similar situation a similar scenario.
Because the city was supposed to start.
Off for a very light-hearted a super.
Positive i wanted to start off by going.
Into the convention and and having.
Different influencers that seeing if my.
Friends recognized me and then.
Eventually going to bunch of the.
Different brands talking to brands on.
Who their influencers that they love.
Working with were asking if i myself.
Steve could be on pr lists i really.
Wanted to go into the public area.
Beautycon didn't really talk to fans but.
For some reason when i walked into just.
The backstage kind of like talent area i.
Something came over me and i was even.
Experiencing this in the car on the way.
There i was really really nervous but.
Something came over me once i walked in.
That was like a feeling probably the.
Most similar feeling that i've ever.
Experienced this and was when i landed.
In africa after the ebola scandal like i.
Saying beauty khanna was in on this.
Video i had told them a few days ago.
That i was going to do this they gave me.
The okay which i was super appreciative.
Of the first step of my video of course.
Was to talk to different influencers.
That i knew because all of them know me.
Very very very well all then pretty much.
Caught on quickly which was funny but.
Also was a little bit disheartening.
Because i really really tried to hide.
Myself almost every single of them said.
That it was my boys that gave it away.
Which of course me and jenny were.
Talking about earlier we knew is this.
Gonna be anything that was gonna give it.
Away it will be my voice let's be real.
The space can be transformed but the.
Salang s voice is not going anywhere no.
Matter how much i try to change it no.
Matter how much i deepen it no matter.
What country i try to pretend like i'm.
From it's me and it gave it away pretty.
Quickly which already kind of put me in.
A weirdest mood going into it i got a.
Little bit discouraged but i was so.
Ready to go super excited i think it's.
Kind of got a little bit awkward and.
Escalated for me personally once i sat.
Down and talked to my really good friend.
Nikita dragon now me and nikita have.
Been friends for literally three years.
Now she.
Probably one of the first influences i.
Ever met i remember going to my first.
Ever gem duty like i was talking about.
In the last video and nikita was so.
Sweet to me she invited me to her.
Birthday party that night and i couldn't.
Go because i was underage but she was.
Just super super welcoming and nikita.
And i have grown really really close.
Over the past few years we tell each.
Other everything i know her family so.
What i went up to her i'd actually made.
Eye contact with naheed his mom and she.
Kind of made a face like i know this.
Person but i don't know this person so i.
Was like shh so she knew something was.
Up and when i went to sit down with her.
Nikita i know figured it out right away.
But nikita if you know her is very.
Playful she loves drama she loves acting.
She's super super funny so when i sat.
Down with her to ask her if i could.
Interview her she was like oh yes of.
Course and she knew exactly what was.
Going on but her management team was.
Like oh no we're not doing any questions.
Right now and nikita's assistant was.
Also right there and she sought me a.
Super super nasty look because i knew.
Nikita knew what was going on i kept.
Talking to her and because i'm so close.
To nikita i was getting closer to her.
And asking her questions even though.
Both her manager team and her assistant.
Told me to stop which is totally my.
Fault for not realizing like hello.
They're not supposed to know that it's.
Me looking at now i am so glad that that.
Happened because i was a very very.
Creepy looking busted crusted dusted man.
Asking very very forceful questions.
Which should not be happening to anybody.
In the entire world and i'm really.
Really glad that nikita had a publicist.
And a security guard there to be like.
Get out of here krause.
We're now stopped talking to my client.
But in the moment because i myself was.
Still james in a different body per se.
It was a very very uncomfortable moment.
For me of course once things started.
Escalating and nikita told them what was.
Going on and we all laughed about it and.
It was fine but it still kind of left a.
Weird feeling in my stomach and after.
Nikita i moved on to a few different.
Smaller influencers that i have seen on.
My explore page and that i know by name.
But i've never really met in person and.
Don't have like a close relationship.
With that that make sense.
I was ardent control but these.
Conversations is what really masses my.
Head really badly and made me want to.
Leave so bad and kind of ruin the whole.
Thing of course i was able to pull a few.
People who didn't quite catch on at.
First and a rubens mate who's another.
Really little boy and makeup was.
Literally saying the sweetest things.
About me i need to not even realize i.
Literally adore him he is so sweet and.
That made my day so so so much but.
Unfortunately his conversation was.
Probably the first one.
Out of all the influences that i talked.
To after that and they were not like.
That at all i'm not including i need the.
Footage in this video because the point.
Of this was not to expose anybody or.
Start drama it was literally a.
Light-hearted video that unfortunately.
Had a turn.
But like 90% of the influencers that i.
Went up to trying to ask interview.
Questions with were so beyond rude and.
So nasty and me it definitely was a.
Little bit of an ego trip which i will.
100% admit because me as someone who was.
Already scared to this video in the.
First place was walking around a beauty.
Convention with a camera woman and a.
Writer and a microphone and that was it.
While a lot of these fellow influencers.
That had like 100,000 followers that.
Have talked so poorly about me in the.
Past but i still want to interview.
Because i thought it would be good for.
The video had full security teams around.
Them which i found a little bit strange.
And when i went up to them trying to ask.
Them if they would do the interview it.
Was either the info to themselves being.
Very very nasty and keep in mind gasps.
Of course i'm like crusty just did.
Busted old man asking a young kid to do.
An interview it's okay to say no i do.
Not blame them but it could have been a.
Simple no thank you i don't have time.
Right now but it's easier than being.
Really really nasty or their security.
Guard which they definitely do not need.
Being also nasty as well it was just a.
Weird situation i'm gonna be honest when.
I'm saying this and i know that i get a.
Lot of comments about this so i kind of.
Want to explain where i'm coming from.
Because i never address this and i.
Always just delete the comments cuz i.
Find it annoying but i do understand why.
This experiment was a major ego check.
For me but also a confidence check for.
Me and my confidence comes from my work.
Which has built my reputation when i.
First when the beauty industry a few.
Years ago i was a boy of course and i.
Was also sixteen years old so because of.
That a lot of people already didn't take.
Me seriously and those are factors.
Obviously that i cannot control but.
There's also a lot of things that i.
Could control that were my own fault.
That kind of ruined my reputation in the.
Industry very very early on i got.
Involved with a lot of drama i fought.
With a lot of different influencers of.
Course now that i'm okay with but a lot.
Of influencers and because.
That a lot of influencers of course work.
Very closely with brands which you guys.
All know so i lost out on a lot of huge.
Branded opportunities and i also had of.
Course we all know those a lot of.
Scandals as well so despite the fact.
That i was gaining followers pretty.
Quickly from viral posts i didn't.
Exactly have the best reputation.
Internally and although i was getting.
Hate online what i truly care about is.
The people around me and that's always.
Than have a person that i'd been on.
Twitter and instagram when i was first.
Starting off there were so many.
Influencers that i was once really close.
Friends with and then the next day on.
Twitter they'd be tweeting about how i.
Was a horrible person because they saw.
Scandal and they wanted to join in and.
Be a part of that bandwagon or so many.
Parties that i would go to and talk to.
People that i thought were my friend and.
Then they would end up talking about me.
Badly on snapchat that same night behind.
My back well i guess not behind my back.
In front of millions of people i guess.
Early on i did not i just didn't have.
The best experience coming into the.
Industry and it's something that i've.
Had to kind of deal with and fix those.
Relationships and also build back my.
Reputation through hard work over the.
Past three years a long time ago when i.
Kind of have this like a reality check.
Of oh my god james you're getting into.
So much drama like stop i had really had.
To make a mental note to get away from.
It and stop saying things about people.
And stop talking about other people and.
Stop being shady and rude it's just.
Unnecessary and one of my ways to kind.
Of cope with that and to fix it was to.
Kind of take a step back from the beauty.
Community and really focus on my true.
Friends outside of the industry and not.
Really attend many events and not do.
That many brand deals anymore and that's.
Kind of the way that i have ruled for.
The past probably year or so i'm just.
Like really private with my team and the.
People that i love the most but today.
Kind of reminded me exactly why i.
Stopped going to those events because.
Just the feeling and the air and the.
Attitude and the egos and the.
Entitlement from some of the people you.
Can just tell that it's just a i don't.
Even know how to explain it to you grace.
It's just a feeling that you get you.
Just feel like you're not wanted in a.
Room and that your presence to somebody.
Else is not taken seriously for their.
Sake i just hope that like myself they.
Realize how ugly it is and will try to.
Turn that around because take it from me.
As someone who has been down that path.
You will have to do a lot of work to fix.
That one day and that work is not fun.
Because of both things that i couldn't.
Control.
My age but also things that were.
Hundred-percent my faults such as my.
Scandals and also my dramatic attitude.
In the beginning i've had to work twice.
As hard as everybody else for the past.
Three years to build up a reputation to.
Show people that i'm not a horrible kid.
And to show people that i do have talent.
And that i want to work hard and that i.
Deserve to be where i am today and i.
Know that i always preach this as well.
Like move silently and let her success.
Speak for herself but i will admit that.
That's always a battle that i've had a.
Fight internally and i of course do.
Always catch myself and i try to stay.
Humble and i try to really put my ego.
Aside but it's not really me thinking.
That i'm the best and thinking that like.
I'm the queen it's me defending that.
Position because of the fact that i had.
So many things working against me when i.
First started and i think that that.
Saying that i really realized today and.
Saying that i kind of need to get over.
In my existence to really not depend on.
My reputation because at the end of the.
Day i love what i do and i worked so.
Hard for what i do and they'll always be.
People following and supporting me no.
Matter what and i think this has been a.
Really great you go check for me because.
I quickly realized that today was.
Triggered for me because it wasn't me.
James charles is confident i love myself.
I am so happy around my fans and around.
Strangers i can be bubbly i can be.
Myself i am not ashamed of that and i.
Love who i am and i can talk to anybody.
And that's why i do my shaders doing.
Makeup videos because they're so much.
Fun and they get to travel in new places.
And experience new people and also me.
You says his along the way but for some.
Reason today having to play a different.
Persona and to kind of hide everything.
That i've worked over the past few years.
To show people was so weird and i could.
Not do it and it was literally like.
Taking my persona of talking fast of.
Using their hands and having their nails.
On and having their julia that they've.
Worked hours and hours and hours of.
Sleepless nights for and being able to.
Wear a full face of makeup and sow their.
Hair really nicely and have cute clothes.
And also not having to throw that all.
Away to having nobody know who i am have.
Nobody know what i've worked for what i.
Stand for and having to be a totally.
Different person who was literally polar.
Opposite of myself.
I i could not do it it it was weird.
And i felt generally trapped under all.
That makeup and all that hair and that.
Beard and i felt like i was literally.
Becoming steve who nobody knew and a lot.
Of people were tweeting very very poorly.
And it kind of brought me back to how i.
Was feeling in the beginning of the.
Industry feeling very very unwelcomed.
Feeling unliked feeling unwanted and my.
Brain started running at a million miles.
Per hour and that's kind of where the.
Anxiety attack came from and that's why.
I needed to get out of that situation.
And get that makeup off and come back as.
Me and not because i needed to feel.
Famous or because i needed the attention.
But because i have worked so hard over.
The past few years to fix myself i'm not.
Even gonna stop talking because it's.
Aaron i have worked so hard to decks.
That reputation and really show people.
My true colors and show people that i am.
A good person and show people that i do.
Have so much love in my heart and i know.
That that should come across naturally.
And it's not saying that i should worry.
About or care about but i can't sit here.
Pretend like at something that is.
Bothering to me because it really is i.
Do care about how people think of me and.
How people look at me and i wish i could.
Say that i did it i'm sure we all do and.
I do have a very very thick skin that i.
Have had to build because i was forced.
To grow up in an industry very very.
Quickly but at the end of the day it.
Still does get to me from time to time.
And it's something that i've had to deal.
With it's been a constant battle.
Internally and a lot of the battle was a.
Hundred percent my fault and i know that.
And i'm okay with that.
But it's been a hard battle to fight and.
It's been a battle that i finally felt.
Like within the past few months i.
Started to win and today all the sudden.
I went back to square one and it was.
Like losing the battle altogether at the.
End of the day although this experience.
Was very very hard for me to go through.
I think i learned three very very.
Valuable lessons one being i myself now.
Need to really fight this internal.
Battle more than ever of not only.
Letting my success really speak for.
Herself and not having to worry about my.
Reputation but really not letting my.
Confidence come from my work.
Really looking back at today i'm not.
Realizing that i do have a major issue.
Of that and a lot of my confidence does.
Come from the fact that i've had a fight.
To get to where i am today and it feels.
Like a battle that i finally won and.
Whenever you win of course you feel.
Really really powerful you feel great.
And you feel just on top of the world.
And that's what i've been feeling the.
Past few months because you guys are.
Always so supportive of me and you guys.
Are really enjoying my content and that.
Makes me so proud as a content creator.
And i feel like we've won that battle.
Together but i don't want my internal.
Confidence to come from that battle.
I need that confidence to come from.
Self-love and that's something that i.
Will be working on definitely after.
Filming this video today because that's.
Bad and it shouldn't be that way too.
I kind of really experienced a lesson.
That i had learned many many years ago.
Very very early on that i thought.
Everybody else was on the same page as.
But i was clearly wrong and that is that.
No matter who you're talking to you.
Always need to be polite no matter who.
They are what they look like what their.
Size is what their color is what their.
Makeup looks like what their hair looks.
Like because you never know who you're.
Really talking to it you never know who.
So much related to be never know who.
Someone's working with and you never.
Know what opportunities or what.
Friendship someone could bring you in.
The future and as it influencer in the.
Space take me out of the equation.
Because i would say the same thing to.
Any other smaller influencer there were.
A lot of really small influencers today.
That i have loved and i thought were so.
Talented and that were so incredibly.
Rude and those people relationship with.
Me that could be very valuable to them.
Or it could be a really great friend to.
Them i love making new friends i'm a.
Pretty good person if i do say so myself.
And i've done the same thing early on to.
A lot of different people and i ruined a.
Lot of relationships and friendships and.
Reputations being my own that i had a.
Fix for a very very long time so i.
Really hope that that's a lesson that a.
Lot of people were able to take from.
This video because it's a valuable one.
And you should always treat people how.
You want to be treated that's something.
That i have really taught myself to live.
By within the past few years of the.
Beauty community because it's a.
Dog-eat-dog world and at the end of the.
Day you just need to be supportive of.
Everyone because we're all in the same.
Business that we're all fighting.
Together and last but finally not least.
Three i learned that i should never ever.
In my entire life love.
Facial hair grow out to a full beard.
Because it looks the absolute worst all.
Right guys i think that is all i have.
For this video silly i hope you enjoyed.
This kind of more like one on one.
Conversation i don't really do this very.
Often and like i was saying it's because.
I don't really like coming across as.
Vulnerable.
I like being really positive i like.
Inspiring you guys i like making you.
Guys happy and this stuff for me is.
Saying that i don't really talking about.
But at the end of the day if it could.
Help anybody that's why i want to talk.
About it and i really hope you guys were.
Able to learn stuff lesson from this.
Video because lord knows i did that i.
Would definitely be taking with me and i.
Hope you enjoyed it i want to say.
Another thank you to channing who is a.
