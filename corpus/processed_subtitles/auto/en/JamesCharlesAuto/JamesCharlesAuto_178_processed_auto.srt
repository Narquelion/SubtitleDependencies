Probably going to be a quite a long one.

Instagram which is just james charles if.
You did not follow me come to him the.
Instagram sisterhood it's where i got my.
Start and i post a lot of a really bomb.
Selfies over there but every single.
Sunday on my instagram story i pick.
Weina really talented and creative.
Artists to take over my ivy story and.
Give you guys a tutorial i am so blessed.
To have a job where i get to share my.
Artwork with the world and inspire you.
Guys i've been having so much fun with.
Lurking and creepily stalking on your.
Guys's instagram pages and i have.
Literally been so beyond shocked at how.
Much talent we have in this sisterhood.
And i have been getting so much.
Inspiration from you guys some of you.
Guys are literally some of the most.
Incredible makeup artists i have ever.
Seen it but for today's video i asked.
Some of you guys to tweet me your.
Favorite makeup looks that you've ever.
Done on yourself and i'm gonna do my.
Best and matching your crazy talent.
Levels and recreated them on my face i.
Think it'll be really fun to see how our.
Different styles compare and it also.
Will be quite a little bit of a.
Challenge because i will say that i.
Picked three pretty awesome looks for.
This first video i definitely wanna do.
More of these in the future so if you.
Guys ever post our makeup books and.
You're just feeling it so proud of it.
Please tweet it to me tied me i want to.
See all your guys's crazy beautiful art.
But without further ado keep on watching.
It you never know your luck may be in.
This video let's get started the first.
Thing i want to try to recreate today is.
This one which is sent in by rocio seja.
If you guys do not know who she is you.
Have to check her out an instagram but.
She does the most beautiful colourful.
Looks i've ever seen in her talent level.
Is literally unreal you have to go check.
Her out she was with me and the benefit.
Broad competition so she definitely has.
A special place in my heart but let's be.
Real a girl can blend and this is.
Definitely gonna be a really really hard.
Challenge one she tweeted me this she.
Literally said good luck sister so.
Challenge accepted so after looking at.
All of rho cos work i noticed that the.
One thing she hasn't common with all of.
Her looks like the little stamp of rocio.
Approval is she has a little star here.
On the inner corner and i know that she.
Does this using a sticker so i want you.
To start today to look for star stickers.
And these foam glitter stars with the.
Only thing i could find this is probably.
Gonna get really messy and really.
Annoying but.
It's gonna go ahead and i'm gonna pop.
One of these right on my inner corner.
Hello.
Let's try that again what that is.
Definitely a way to bigger stars and.
Sister rose here we usually use this but.
You know what.
So the colors did her luck today are.
Obviously a rainbow so i figured the.
Best palate to use for this would be the.
Morphine 35b it has all colors of the.
Rainbow i love this palette and you can.
Use code james for 10% off i'm gonna.
Grab it m 4-3-3 brush and dip into this.
Bright yellow shade down in here i'm.
Gonna start by packing that into the.
Inner corner she also always brings her.
Shadow all the way up to her brow bone.
As well and kind of almost blends into.
Her brows but i feel like i have a lot.
More eyelid space in roco so i'm just.
Gonna keep it more concentrated towards.
The crease region i'm next time i go to.
Another clean and 4-3-3 brush and dip.
Into this shade right here and i'm gonna.
Pack this right here kind of in the.
Center of the eyelid her rainbow colors.
Are literally always so incredibly.
Pigmented and boy i have no idea what.
The heck she does to get her shadow i.
Was like this i always have to build.
Them up so intensely i'm gonna go back.
Into the some more yellow and make sure.
That those two colors are really.
Seamlessly blended together i'm mixing.
To grab another clean and 4-3-3 and dip.
Into this bright blue shade right up in.
This corner here and pop that right next.
To the green a few weeks ago i did a.
Favorite brushes haul on my incertum.
Stories which is still highlighted by.
The way so if you want to go check that.
Out.
How'd it rich my tensor time and go look.
At all my favorite brushes and of course.
You get your discount but when i was.
Talking about blending brushes i of.
Course mentioned the m4a3 which you guys.
Saw was like my all-time favorite brush.
And i said that i had 27 of these so.
Many people were like why the hell do.
You need 27 of the same eyeshadow brush.
Well i already used three so far this is.
Why our next to go with a matte 514 and.
Dip into this bright purple shade and.
Use just to finish off my little outer v.
How did she get her shadows to be so.
Pigmented i'm next to have a little bit.
Of my mac select cover-up concealer and.
I mac 252 brush and i'm just going to.
Carve out a little bit of like a halo.
Eye type situation next i grab this.
Bright teal shade on a flat packer brush.
And i'm going to stretch it with some.
Mac fix+ to make that shadow.
Super duper intense and we're going to.
Pack that right on the center of that.
Little halo eye we just carved out.
I'm gonna use those thing instead colors.
I did before and create the same that.
Pattern of the rainbow just inside of.
That little halo eye we carved out when.
Applying the shadows i'm more padding.
And tapping them into place as opposed.
To kind of like souping them and like.
Brushing them on in circular motions i.
Really want these clothes to be the most.
Pigmented they can possibly be and we're.
Gonna achieve that by packing them on.
And then to really make that halo eye.
Pop i'm gonna grab the mac reflex teal.
And pop that right on the center i think.
This came out like okay.
Damn rocio has talent i did not think it.
Was gonna be this hard for the lower.
Lash that i'm gonna grab another fluffy.
Brush and go in with the bright red.
Shade and i'm gonna pop that right on at.
The outer corner and then some orange.
Right in the middle of that lower lash.
Line.
And then going back into the inner.
Corner with some of that yellow to.
Finish off the lower lash line at.
Rainbow and last certainly not least for.
The shadow portion of this look i'm.
Gonna go a just done some packing brush.
From morphe and the sugar pills single.
Shadow in the shade taco this is.
Probably the most pigmented white eye.
Shadow there is this one is so so so.
Bomb i'm gonna dip right in it to that.
Shade and get a whole lot on the brush.
And hopefully fingers crossed that this.
Foam star sticker works i'm gonna pop.
This right here for my final reveal i.
Really hope this worked i'm gonna grab.
Some tweezers and i'm going to peel off.
The star that is probably the worst i've.
Ever seen for once this is not my fault.
I blame this one on the sticker and then.
To finish off the stuff today i'm gonna.
Pop on the makeup shock lashes in the.
Style onyx.
I know roseola loves these and uses.
These all the time.
Okay guys that is what i all complete.
I'm gonna go ahead and do the one.
Off-camera quickly and i'll be right.
Back with the finished roasty oh say hot.
Look okay that's that about one hour now.
I am finished the other eye and i am.
Back with the completed look and i just.
Want to say good lord in heaven about.
This was literally so hard to do like i.
Already had an immense amount of respect.
For rocio before as an artist but trying.
To actually recreate her i'm a little.
Shocked right now this look is not my.
Best looking at the original picture her.
Blending work is impeccable her colors.
Are beyond pigmented and her crease is.
So costly perfectly there's like a nice.
Bright.
Shyne right in the middle and of course.
Her star on the inner corner is looking.
Perfect i think i got the entire look.
The star was actually at the hardest.
Part but like i said blaming it on the.
Stickers i tried to outline it with some.
White eyeliner to make it look a little.
Bit more defined but it is really not.
Looking the best major applause for her.
And hats off because she's such a.
Talented artist like i said if you guys.
Do not know who she is or if you've not.
Seen her work before please go check her.
Out for a far far far better and more.
Talented version of this and yeah that.
Is the rose feel look all complete okay.
Guys so the first thing i want to.
Recreate today was sent in by an artist.
I follow on twitter by the name of ivy.
Kongu she is so incredibly talented and.
So beautiful when she sent this that i.
Literally at guard i think i have a.
Really fun way to kind of put my own.
Twist on this when i saw this i just.
Thought it was so stunning the shadows.
Are so bright and pigmented and the.
Contrast between the shadows and her.
Skin color literally like so incredibly.
Beautiful so i'm gonna try my best to do.
Ivies injustice and put my own sister.
James twist on her look today okay so.
I'm first gonna start by grabbing my.
Morphe m 513 fluffy brush and my.
Radioactive pigment from melt cosmetics.
These shadows are so incredibly.
Pigmented and i really want this look to.
Be very very bright and vibrant so just.
Gonna take this on my brush and i'm.
Gonna pop this right on this inner.
Corner area i'm really gonna press that.
Shadow in there because we are going to.
Be covering out the crease so this can.
Be a little bit messy i just want these.
Colors to be extremely extremely vibrant.
I'm next gotta good with my morphe i'ma.
4-3-3 brush and dip into this bright.
Purple shade right up in here i'm gonna.
Use this to put it in my outer crease.
And shape out an outer v as well once.
Again i'm gonna start off by really.
Packing this color in there and pressing.
It end to make the colors super super.
Pigmented and then kind of go in.
Afterwards and blend them together i am.
Gonna be adding a winged liner so to.
Kind of follow through with that shape.
I'm just gonna take that brush and i'm.
Going to press it right in on that outer.
Corner to kind of create that v-shape.
And then just connect it up to that.
Crease region just like that before we.
Go in and blend out the edges because.
They're looking a little bit wonky at.
This point i'm going to take a little.
Bit more of that purple on the same.
Exact brush and packed it on the outer.
Lid just to get ready for the base of.
That half-cooked crease.
Looking at ivy's photo she definitely.
Has a very very high contrast in that.
Look so to add a little bit more.
Contrast to my look today i'm gonna go.
My morphe i'm a 506 brush and dip into.
It the black and the bottom.
35b and i just a little bit of that in.
The outer v be sure to not go crazy i'm.
Just gonna wiggle a little bit of the.
Shadow into that outer corner and kind.
Of pull it out just do your slightest.
Bit just to add some more dimension and.
That is plenty enough and i'm gonna go.
Back in with maya i'm four three three.
Brush that i just used with that purple.
Shade dip into a little bit more purple.
And then just go right over that edge so.
To make sure that the block doesn't get.
Everywhere to carve out the half cut.
Crease i'm gonna use my steel out liquid.
Metals and the shade rose gold retro.
This one is a little bit more orange.
Tone that i would have liked but i'm.
Gonna layer over top of it using the.
Urban decay glitter liner in this shade.
Grind to make it a little bit more pinky.
I'm gonna dip back into that radioactive.
3 brush and.
I'm gonna go right over that edge.
Between the purple and the shadow we.
Just put down and then going back into.
Some more purple on the outer corner and.
Then like i said going into that urban.
Decay at glitter liner to make it more.
Pink other than that crease is cut for.
The gods and all dried out i'm gonna add.
A lilac liquid liner today using the la.
Splash pro artist liner in the shade.
Psychedelic this purple isn't as bright.
As i want it to be so i'm gonna grab the.
Makeup forever aqua xl liner and this is.
In the shade i don't even know it's the.
Light purple and i'm gonna go over top.
Of that with this i don't know what was.
Going on here but i was definitely.
Having some liner troubles i just.
Finished up the wing using that makeup.
Forever aqua xl liner and then use some.
Concealer to clean up below it because.
It was getting a little bit messy but.
For lust i'm gonna pop on something nice.
And light and simple which of course you.
Guys know my lily lashes in the style.
Miami these are like at this point kind.
Of the only eye lashes i wear but.
They're just so pretty and they'll fit.
Perfectly with this look because clearly.
We want to show off what's going on on.
The eyelid but my lower lash line roots.
Gonna go that same exact a dark purple.
Shade on my i'm 4-3-3 brush and pop this.
In the outer corner right up against.
That lash line then popping that pink.
Shade right on the inner corner to.
Connect it back up and then taking my.
Abbot 1 v 1 brush and dipping into this.
Dark purple shade right down here i'm.
Mixing it with the slightest bit a black.
I'm going to use this to connect.
The outer corner up to the wing i'm.
Really hugging the shade right up.
Against that lashline because i don't.
Want everything to get too dark and.
Muddy and then just pulling this right.
Up against that lilac little wing i.
Really want my eyes to look big and have.
A lot of attention drawn to them so i'm.
Next i grab my benefit high brow pencil.
Which is a pink like wax pencil this is.
Normally for highlighting your brows but.
I'm pretty sure it's isafe don't quote.
Me on that.
Maybe don't have this at home but i'm.
Just gonna pop this right on the lower.
Lashline to really open my eyes and make.
Them look huge okay guys that is one eye.
All complete for right now i definitely.
Have a few more things that i want to.
Add to this look but i'm gonna do the.
Other one off camera quickly to save.
Some time and i'll be right back all.
Right sighs design back with the.
Finished look but i'm honestly loving.
How this looks so far sister i have you.
Put little hearts right here to kind of.
Fit together like the whole love theme.
But we're gonna take it one step further.
So i grab these like little glitter.
Hearts that i found in my clitoris we're.
Gonna even have these but i'm gonna pop.
A little bit of these right underneath.
My eyes to be like kind of a glitter to.
Your type of situation i'm just gonna.
Apply this using the violet voss glitter.
Adhesive and just put a little bit of.
This right up in here then just rushing.
Those on using up my finger and then.
Finally to finish off this look today.
I'm going to add some heart freckles.
Using some different shades of pink and.
Purple liquid lipstick all from oprah.
These are in the shades of laguna beach.
Las vegas panama and mocha and this.
Isn't forever i looked at i saw nikita.
Drag and do it she looked so cute so i'm.
Gonna do it myself as well today.
Okay so honestly this look kind of got.
Real intense real fast i'm honestly not.
Sure if i'm loving the heart freckles.
But you know what.
I made the decision it is way too late.
So we're gonna rock them now and i.
Finished off this look i'm just going to.
Go on in the ofra liquid lipstick in.
Laguna beach right guys and that is this.
Lovesick look inspired by sister ivy.
Kongu all complete this definitely was.
Not exactly what i envisioned it.
Originally but i am definitely really.
Proud of how this came out i think that.
The eye look is literally so sunny i.
Definitely want to do a lot more looks.
Using this like pasta eyeliner i think.
It's such a nice stark contrast from the.
Usual black liquid liner i'm honestly.
Like those looks really really bomb and.
I hope you guys really really liked it.
Too and sister ivy if you're watching i.
Hope i did you proud let's move on to.
The next transformation okay so the next.
Thing i want to recreate today is this.
One from it make drew on it hello vicki.
There you go mick drew on twitter the.
Next look i want to recreate today is.
This one which was sent in by it mick.
Drew on twitter it is like this cool.
Tone or brown cut crease with a pop of.
Light blue in the inner corner i think.
It is so stunning and so beautiful and.
I've actually not done a cut crease at a.
Hot minute so i'm gonna do it this look.
Today please leave nora my nose baking.
As well i've had to take off part of my.
Makeup like three times out there at the.
Point of this video to try to do all.
These looks and one day this has been a.
Really intense but assisters nose needs.
To be snatched no matter what so just.
Roll with me here okay so when drew's.
Look she definitely knows like all whole.
Tom browns and i actually don't have a.
Single palette that's like all cool.
Tones i definitely need to get that so.
If you know of any lettuce sister no but.
I'm gonna be using the morphe 39a today.
Because i feel like they're like you.
Cool tone browns up in here we're gonna.
Make it work i'm first gonna start my.
Carving miami 513 which is a fluffy.
Blending brush and dipping into this.
Light brown.
Cool tool in transition shade and.
Putting this in the shape of a cut.
Crease when i do my cut crease i like to.
Keep the shadows focused kind of above.
The lid just for a more lifted and.
Really really large eye look but you can.
Obviously place your shadows wherever.
Your heart desires.
I'm gonna grab a slightly smaller.
Blending brush this is the m 4-3-3 you.
Guys know i have like literally a.
Million of these in my collection in it.
They're so good and i'm gonna dip into.
This slightly darker brown shade it.
Right up in here and use this to it to.
Find out the crease a little bit more.
I'm just gonna play says once again in.
That same shape following my natural.
Crease and.
Pulling it out towards the end screw.
That cut crease shape that we all know.
And love to finish off the shadow.
Portion already on my m56 too and dip.
Into this kind of slightly warm tone of.
Cranberry dark brown up in here and i'm.
Gonna pop this just the slightest bit in.
The crease i really like using this to.
Just get the slightest bit of definition.
In cut creases and stuff like that.
Because you're able to kind of put the.
Color on and bonds it out at the same.
Time without putting it everywhere now.
That we have the general shape and.
Blending of the cut crease all complete.
I wonder grabbed as any folk harbors.
Concealer this is the max i like to.
Cover up and i'm gonna be using the mac.
252 brush i just found this from.
Mitchell and stacy maria i'm doing an.
Instagram and i have been obsessed with.
This brush recently and i'm just gonna.
Use this to carve out my crease okay so.
Don't do what i just did and rush.
Through the carving of the crease.
Because it clearly this is not the shape.
That we're going for today i was.
Definitely a way too confident and that.
Crease cutting situation so let's try.
This again.
I used to be literally so good at cut.
Crease is what is going on right now.
Okay doing this cut crease that i just.
Humbled me right off it has been a way.
Too long since i've done one clearly it.
Is showing in this work here this is not.
My best status for sure but we're gonna.
Keep on talking and hopefully those will.
Come together at the end i'm gonna grab.
A tiny brush just like this i dip into.
The same dark brown shade and start.
Sketching out my wing just like a.
Regular wing liner i'm gonna pull this.
Right up out from the outer corner i'm.
Gonna pull the shade a little bit under.
The lower lash line as well does because.
We are obviously gonna be putting shadow.
There so that helps get the wing shape.
Nice and correct i'm gonna use this same.
Shadow to lately pack on the shape of a.
Winged liner and not making this too.
Thick because we're gonna be doing a.
Little bit of an ombre waiting today.
Grabbing our original transition shade.
I'm gonna grab a small fluffy brush just.
Like this one and lightly go over the.
Edge to kind of buff and blend it out so.
We have an ombre a wing so that is the.
Ombre smoky liner all complete but.
Clearly it got a little bit messy so i'm.
Gonna go miami four three two you guys.
Know this is my favorite concealer brush.
For doing under the brows but it's also.
Great because it's flat so i'm gonna.
Grab just a little bit more of that.
Concealer and i'm going to lightly go.
Over that edge and cut out the.
There we go now we're talking since we.
Already went ahead and put a little bit.
Of that darkness on the lower lash line.
It from before all i'm gonna do is grab.
My original transition sheet on a fluffy.
Brush and just bring that right under.
The lower lash line connecting it up top.
To that wing and just finishing it off.
For the pop-up blue in the inner corner.
I'm gonna grab my morphia 35 b palette.
And just any old fluffy brush this one.
Will do this happens to be another 33.
I'm gonna dip it right into right here.
And just pop this right in the inner.
Corner i'm not gonna put too much blue.
Here because we definitely want to do a.
Light base so the pigment really picks.
Up that blue sheen and then finally for.
That pop in the inner corner i'm gonna.
Grab my mac reflex teal this is my.
All-time favorite glitter slosh penguins.
I don't even know what this would be.
Considered but whatever it doesn't.
Matter i'm gonna pop that right in the.
Inner corner that is what i'm talking.
About oh my god this is so pretty.
I love this then i'm just gonna pop on a.
Wispy pair of lashes all right sister.
Status one eye all complete i feel like.
For the amount of issues we were having.
Earlier on we somehow managed to pull it.
Together this is looking so beautiful so.
Far but i'm gonna go in and do the other.
One off camera quickly and i'll be right.
Back with the finished look all right.
Guys i am back with the other eye all.
Complete this one was much easier to do.
Off camera thank god i don't know what.
Was going on here but i think we.
Definitely pulled this together to.
Finish off the look i decided some more.
Glow and some more highlighter anasazi.
Yeah so hollywood as always and then i.
Paired the lip with anasazi ashtyn.
Liquid lipstick and this is the.
Completed look inspired by it make dru.
Marquez and those are all three looks.
