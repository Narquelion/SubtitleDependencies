Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my channel since the.
Very very start of my instagram feed and.
Following in general my brows have.
Always been something that are very very.
Controversial and always that widely.
Talked about people either love my bushy.
Defined brows or they hate them with a.
Passion and they describe them as things.
Like lego or caterpillars but either way.
They're still talking about them which.
In pr sense is very very good rather to.
What people think though my brows have.
Changed very very drastically from the.
Start of my instagram career they've.
Gotten much more natural still large and.
In charge but much less sharp ii like so.
For today's video i thought i would sit.
Down and do it update a brow routine.
Because i don't think i've ever actually.
Done one on this channel before and i.
Get so many questions every single video.
Asked me how i do my brows because for.
The most part i do usually do them.
Off-camera.
To save time so that being said if you.
Want to see how i get my very very.
Natural yet bushy large enough charts.
And defined brows make sure you keep on.
Watching alright so i already went ahead.
It and i did my base up camera that.
Being my foundation concealer powdered.
My entire face did a little bit of.
Contour and highlight just so doesn't.
Look too weird and then baked my face as.
Well and then it wiped it off i do this.
In every single video and then my next.
Step would usually be my eyebrows which.
I usually do off-camera just to save.
Time but like i was saying today we were.
Going to be doing my brow routine which.
Is what i do in every single look.
Whether or not it's on camera my brows.
Have changed so drastically since the.
Beginning of my instagram career so i.
Thought it would be absolutely perfect.
To sit down today and team up with.
Benefit cosmetics they give you guys an.
Updated brow routine just shot off my.
Brows today i'm just gonna grab the.
Benefit process in my eyebrow pencil and.
I'm just gonna shake off the bottom end.
To use the spoolie and i'm actually just.
Going to start by brushing through via.
Bra harris and brush them all kind of.
Upwards just to see kind of how big.
And bushy eyebrows we are just to get a.
Good idea of where underneath filling in.
And what areas and don't need as much.
First product i'm going to go ahead with.
Is the bravo conditioning primer and i'm.
Just going to take the top off and i'm.
Going to do this a few million times and.
I'm just gonna run it through the brow.
Hairs just like a primer for your face.
This is a primer for your brow hair so.
It just gets them nice and ready to pull.
Product and really ensures that your.
Brows will last all day long.
And it also makes like i said before.
Your brows as full as possible so you.
Get a good idea of where you should be.
Putting the product and getting your.
Brows on fleek and i'm just gonna go on.
The back and let's we'll leave one more.
Time just to evenly distribute that.
Product through the brow hairs and once.
Again it push the hair.
If you have any straight brown hair this.
Would be a perfect time to grab your.
Tweezers and pluck them up before we get.
Too far into the filling in and the rest.
Of the brow routine.
I'm just really carefully plucking out.
Any stray hairs that i know are not.
Going to be in i do get asked all the.
Time - like who does your eyebrows only.
Loudly but you get them done and i.
Actually do my brows completely myself.
I've been tweezing my own brows for a.
Very very long time and i do consider.
Myself pretty good at it at this point i.
Also taste a lot of my friends brows as.
Well and have made some fantastic brow.
Transformations if i do say so myself.
But i really do like tweezing my brow i.
Would not trust anybody else to wax or.
The red now i'm just way too scared and.
Obviously as a beauty - i have a very.
Very distinct style of what i like my.
Brows to look like but if you are.
Someone who wants to get them through or.
Tweeze please do this is definitely not.
Like an easy thing to do in any way.
Shape or form and if you don't trust.
Yourself please leave it to a.
Professional because i've seen stories.
My poor mom is someone who actually had.
Definitely overlooked her broadly she.
Was younger and now she regrets it all.
The time and she's always asking me to.
Draw in her brows for her which i always.
Do a course but the poor girl barely has.
Any eyebrows left so definitely be.
Careful when you're plucking and go to.
Professional if you don't trust your.
Self home to actually fill in and shape.
The brows that i'm gonna be using once.
Again deep resizing my brow pencil in.
The shade number 4.
I like oops i like the tip of this.
Because it is super super tiny and.
Defined so it really lets me get really.
Really light and defined lines and in.
This front area - i can really sketch in.
Those tiny hairs and make it look.
Realistic i don't like to start off my.
Brows like kind of sketching out the.
Bottom line so i'm just going to start.
On the front here and i'm going to.
Really really really lightly it'd be.
Good to shape out the.
As you guys can see my brother's really.
Do not have that much of an arch either.
So when i'm in this inner corner i.
Really like to start kind of low and.
Pull it up at an angle creating more of.
An arch effect that isn't really there.
And then of course if i make any.
Mistakes or anything looks too harsh.
I'll just switch over to the spoolie end.
And i'll comb really lightly over it.
Just to it.
Oh throughout this entire video i'm.
Going to using this spoolie and this a.
Lot just kind of switching back and.
Forth back and forth to get the perfect.
Results when i get to the outer corner.
I'm going to take it the pens lit number.
Two really lightly flick it out towards.
The end just like when it comes to.
Shaping your browser obviously gonna.
Want to do what works best for your face.
Shape but i find for me personally the i.
Really like to say eyebrows that goes up.
And then kind of out i don't really like.
When my brows go down i feel like i have.
Like a very very tall face so i like to.
Kind of widen it as much as possible so.
By pulling this brow out towards like.
This area rather than towards the bottom.
Of my cyber i get a much like wider more.
Masculine effect i guess but do whatever.
Works best for you i'm not grabbing that.
Pencil i'm going to start defining the.
Tail so i'm just drawing a line.
Connecting it right down to that point.
Then like i said it grimy that's fully.
To just blend forward and food.
Traditions like i said i'd really to.
Fake a little bit of an arch on my brow.
I'm like before once again thank god.
Those old brow days are over i'm going.
To what start by grabbing the pencil and.
I'm going to really lightly sketch a.
Horn line if anything i like the of.
Bottom some eyebrows to be a little bit.
To find it but i don't like the top to.
Be super defined well because that's.
When we get into like the lego sharpie.
Style borrow that they used to have and.
That style is over up done with pencil.
Never wants to get again when it comes.
To the inner corner of the brow i really.
Like the hairs to be very very wispy.
Looking and i like there to be a natural.
Ombre from the front to the tip of the.
Brow this part obviously being a whole.
Lot darker i'm just guessing in a few.
Tiny little hairs really really lightly.
In the front here just to kind of give.
It a little bit of shape but not doing.
Any real filling and and then once again.
Describing these spoolie on the end of.
The precisely my brow pencil and just.
Brushing through the brow hairs to kind.
Of brush them up in the right direction.
And the blend through the product and.
Making sure that there is no area where.
It is very very concentrated you know.
Any sparse area that we don't want any.
It's are four areas either the goal is.
To have that nice but still defined what.
That brought us all a roughly put in.
Place my next up is gonna be to grab my.
Favorite concealer watch it right now.
With the tarik tape tape and just put a.
Little bit on the back of my hand and.
Then we're just going to clean up that.
Brow i'm gonna really let they follow.
The line that i sketched in using the.
Brow pencil and like i said before it.
Does not need to be a perfect because.
Now at the time we get to clean up any.
Mistakes.
Regardless of what products steps or.
Techniques you use and your brow routine.
I feel like this is one set that is.
Absolutely by all no matter who you are.
Or what your shape is or like but your.
Style is and like just cleaning up via.
Bottom of the brows makes it look so.
Much more defined makes them with a.
Whole lot cleaner and i would definitely.
Recommend you to do that if you don't.
Already do it now that the brow is all.
Smashed and defined my last and final.
Step it's going to be to go in to be a.
Benefit gimme brow gel in the shade and.
Number three i absolutely love this brow.
Gel because the wand is so freakin tiny.
So you can really get in on the hangers.
And make sure you're not gonna make any.
Mistakes i can't even tell you how many.
Times i've gotten my brows to look so.
Frickin good.
And then i've bought into the brow gel.
And just got like one brown line or.
Smudge little get the worst thing in the.
Entire world so like i said i really.
Really do it like this wand just like.
They couldn't see that under the brows i.
Really really really good at brow gel.
It's an absolute necessity i need it.
Good or protein just because as the day.
Goes on and your sweat cons hard to.
Remove product and the hairs are gonna.
Start to move around so this challenge.
Is really in terms of the hair stay.
Locked in place in the market what.
Alright guys i just draw in some lashes.
And a quick gloss and that is the.
Completed look and video for today my.
Brow style has changed so much since.
