Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel so as.
You can see we are in a completely new.
And different setup i'm actually filming.
In my old beauty room because a few days.
Ago i decided last second to turn my.
Film in i grew up into a walk-in closet.
Literally the most obnoxious first for a.
Problem ever but i was actually running.
Out of storage in my closet and i was.
Thinking oh my god i want to focus more.
On clothes because you guys disheartened.
To realize that i usually wear the same.
Five outfits like every single week.
Which is getting a little bit.
Embarrassing at this point so sister.
Wants to step up her fashion again for.
Sure i decided that i wanted to change.
My filming room into a walk-in closet.
Which i now have installed and you guys.
Will be singing the apartment tour.
Coming on very very soon but that left.
Me with a very rear dilemma of not.
Having anywhere to film so i actually.
Just converted my beauty room into a.
Beauty and filming room mr. kay helped.
Me it is so freakin beautiful so i.
Really really hope you guys are enjoying.
The new setup it's just it's very very.
Simple background with shells and.
Paintings and yeah definitely comment.
Down below and tell me if you like it.
Let me know if the audio is good let me.
Know if the lighting's good this is the.
First video i've ever even film sitting.
Down here so i'm trying my best to make.
Sure it is all set up but of course as.
We go on and things progress i'll get.
Better and things will be perfect and.
The way they were before and back to.
Normal james charles quality all that.
Being said i've heard today's video as.
You can see i'm wearing this bronzy very.
Very simple glam this is actually.
Kendall jenner inspired look her makeup.
Artist hong van gogh i think that's how.
You pronounce his name posted a.
Beautiful freakin picture of kendall on.
His instagram and i was cooked to the.
Core and i wanted to recreate this look.
So so about me obviously the jenner and.
Kardashian's always have iconic makeup.
Looks that everybody's always recreating.
If you guys want to see how i created.
This bronzy glowy winged out shadow.
Moment inspired by at kendall j herself.
Make sure you keep on watching alright.
So since this is a super dewy and.
Moisturized look i'm first gonna start.
Off by priming my face using my a.
Benefit total moisture cream i've.
Recently been loving this cream so.
Freakin much if you guys know me you.
Would know that the skincare is not.
Exactly something that i've learned a.
Lot about or kind of focused on in the.
Past but i've been trying to get into it.
A little bit more recently because i'm.
Not trying to be you know chronically.
And gross by the time i get to like 21.
So i want to have nice and glowy skin.
Forever so i have been moisturizing a.
Lot more recently and i've truly but.
Actually seen like a major change in my.
Skin.
I've been trying to cut out the pepsi as.
Such as it hurts and drink a lot more.
Water too but honestly ivan seemed like.
Such a major difference.
I had this breakout so going on from my.
New york trip but she's heading away.
She's on the way out i told her to pack.
Her bags hopefully we'll be back to.
Dewey and beautiful skin within the next.
Few weeks.
Fingers crossed in this amazing photo.
Kendall's makeup artist hung it gave her.
This beautiful dewy moisturize.
Foundation look as always that we all.
Strive for but can't really achieve.
Because it only looks good for about.
Five seconds but for today's look to.
Recreate this as closely as possible i'm.
Gonna use the giorgio armani luminous.
Silk foundation i'm going to be doing a.
Super super light coat of this.
Foundation all over my skin i really do.
Not want to do it like the full coverage.
Today i just want a very very light.
Layer just to even everything out but.
Still give us enough coverage to the.
Point where like our blemishes and red.
Spots are covered because lord knows.
Thanks new york we have a lot of them.
Right now next i'm gonna grab the tarte.
Shave tape concealer and this is in the.
Shade lightmedium honey and i'm just.
Gonna use these slightest bit of this.
Just to go over any areas that have a.
Little bit more breakouts like right up.
In here here here i'm basically just.
Applying a super light amount of this on.
Any areas that need a little bit more.
Coverage did you guys do luminous look.
Has a beautiful finish but doesn't have.
The most coverage in the world so i'm.
Just gonna use this to just amp up those.
Areas and really make sure we have that.
Flawless but still a dewy finish when i.
Blend this in i'm just blending it in.
Super super lightly to make sure to just.
Bounce it in and blend it without.
Actually taking off i need the product.
And then to actually bright and i'm.
Going to grab a shape tape once again.
But this time in the shade a light and.
I'm just gonna do a little bit of that.
Under both of the eyes then i'm just.
Going to grab the slightest bit of laura.
Mercier powder and i'm just going to.
Lightly set underneath my eyes and.
That's actually about it.
For the contour and bronson a for once.
In my life b cap on d shade and light.
Palette is nowhere to be seen on the.
Front of my table and sadang abusing the.
Benefit hoola light bronzer until pilate.
Said i'm using my makeup shack t 28.
Brush i think i've only used this.
Bronzer maybe once before because you.
Guys know sister james loves a good a.
Bronze a cut contour but for today.
Second i feel like i just want to keep.
It really really light and do we just.
Like the photo of camel because it was.
Literally so stunning like my breath was.
Taken away and i want to recreate it as.
Closely as possible and kendall was.
Really not too a contour she just had.
Like a nice bronze look going on for.
Brows that i'm going to quickly define.
Them using my anasazi offense on the.
Shade medium at brown in the photo that.
Kendall's makeup artist shared she had a.
Super super thin and just really really.
Arched brows and those things are two.
Qualities that definitely are not.
Associated with james charles brows.
That's for sure so i'm just trying my.
Best to really define them the least.
Amount possible and just kind of fill.
Them in and give it a little bit more.
Shape but still keep them really really.
The light and airy.
Just like kendall ash and lastly to.
Finish off the brows i'm just gonna go.
To the anasazi a clear brow gel and i'm.
Just gonna brush those hairs upwards to.
Create the light and fluffy feathered.
Brow effect to primary let's for santa.
I'm just gonna add a drop of the shape.
Tape lightmedium honey on the lids and.
Then i'm just gonna blend that and using.
My makeup shack tee at 59 brush just to.
Give a light and even base for the.
Little bit of shadow that we're going to.
Put on there the hashed out of today.
We're gonna be using the morphe 35o.
Palette and listen i know you guys are.
Probably so sick of hearing all about.
This palette but trusty it is actually a.
Really really good palette i just feel.
Like with a lot of celebrity makeup we.
All like look at these celebrities at.
This beautiful glowing glam and we just.
Want to recreate them on ourselves but.
Oftentimes we feel as though because.
They're celebrities they're usually.
Using like million-dollar makeup so.
Obviously the 3500 was a very very cheap.
Alternative to very very expensive.
Palettes it is $22 for 35 shades and you.
Guys can use code james for tempers and.
Love your purchase at morphe brushes.
Calm i.
Yeah it's gonna be a bomb pilot to serve.
This look obviously used it ever a brown.
Orange home palette you want to but i'm.
Gonna go with this baby today to lay.
Down at light base in the crease i'm.
Gonna go with my makeup shack t4 brush.
And dip into this cool tone orange shade.
Right here for this actual makeup look.
Kendall had her inner corner pretty.
Light and then it got more and more dark.
And defined as we got to the outer.
Corner when we get to that super.
Snatched upward v which i am so excited.
For but yeah for the starting shades i'm.
Gonna keep them very very light and just.
Make sure they are nice and evenly.
Blended out next i'm gonna grab my.
Makeup shock t-33 brush and dip into.
This warm tone orange right up in here.
I'm gonna focus this color on the outer.
Lid and then jog whatever is left up.
Into the crease and make sure they are.
Blended out and then a little bit into.
The inner corner next under grab that.
Same exact brush and dip into this cool.
Tone brown right below it and start to.
Define the outer corner i'm gonna be.
Very very slow impatient when layering.
This color onto that outer third even.
Though this look is supposed to be like.
That effortless glam look those looks.
Are usually the ones that actually take.
The most amount of work ironically.
Enough so i'm just being super super.
Careful i'm blending it very very slowly.
And lightly to make sure we still have.
Everything really really blown out and.
Even once you get to that outer corner.
I'm also taking that shadow on the tip.
Of the brush and i'm going to start.
Winging outwards dipping into that same.
Last dark brown shade i'm gonna grab my.
Morphe r44 basically just use any angled.
Brush you want and i'm going to try to.
Sketch out that little wing that kind of.
Had it going on.
Then govern my makeup shakti to brush.
I'm just going to lightly blend out that.
Line and diffuse that darker color.
Inwards.
And then one last time gonna grab that.
T4 brush and just blend over those i.
Just make sure everything is really.
Really nice and defined but still a.
Blended well up together now that we had.
This line all sketched out it is very.
Very defined looking and i'm loving how.
It looks but i definitely do want to.
Clean it up the slightest bit but i feel.
Like using concealers is gonna make it.
Look too intense so i'm gonna do is grab.
The mac next to nothing studio nope just.
Kidding' just the next to nothing a.
Pressed powder and my makeup shakti 86.
Brush and i'm gonna dab just the.
Lightest bit of that and i'm going to.
Use that powder just to kind of sketch.
The bottom just to clean it up.
Oh yeah that literally looks a million.
Times better the lower lash line.
Normally the first thing i would do.
Would be line it so we can it then smoke.
Out the shadow below it but i actually.
Can't find a mile an hour that i was.
Gonna use i usually love using the nyx.
Tan liner i brought it out to film and.
Now i cannot find it anywhere so i'm.
Just gonna go into the benefit high brow.
Pencil instead is this eye safe i have.
No idea.
Couldn't tell you but it's a light.
Off-white shade so it's gonna do the job.
Anyway.
Okay wow i honestly have no idea this is.
Even safe for the eyes but it goes on.
Really really nicely and it's super.
Pigmented as well so sorry next guess.
We're using benefit high brow from now.
On for the lower lash line it's gonna be.
Super super simple i'm just gonna start.
Off with my 82 brush and dip into that.
Cool tone of brown right below our poor.
Orange shade that we use on the upper.
Lash line and i'm just oh there she is.
I'm just using this brush and pressing.
The shade right up into that lash line.
Just to create a little bit of a.
Defining moment and i am gonna bring.
That shadow all the way into the inner.
Corner as well which is saying that i.
Normally don't do it but kendall had it.
So we're gonna do it today next i'm just.
Gonna grab my.
T-49 brush and dip into the original.
Light orange shade that we used and just.
Buff out those edges to highlight my.
Inner corner and brow bone i'm gonna.
Grab my eta t6 brush and dip into the.
Laura geller gilded honey highlighter.
And there's going to push my brush a.
Little bit of a fix plus to make it.
Super intense and blinding.
As we are only doing lashes today lord.
Knows that wearing a lot of falsies.
Continuously it rips them out of my face.
All the time which is so so sad so i.
Don't have very many lashes left to work.
With i am gonna go into the lash curler.
Quickly and just snatch those lashes up.
So just to help without defining a.
Process and then for mascara today i'm.
Going to be using the maybelline big.
Shot mascara.
All right status when i complete i'm.
Gonna go and do the other one off-camera.
Quickly and then i'll be right back with.
You finish off the rest of the face.
Alright and that is both eyes all.
Complete and the next step of course is.
Going to be the glow i'm gonna use once.
Again gilded honey and i'm going to use.
My alexi 560 brush and i'm going to dip.
Into this and i'm going to put this.
Right on the highest points of my.
Cheekbones now i would normally would.
Never use fan brush when it comes to.
Highlighting because i don't know i just.
Have never like learned to use them but.
I was watching desi perkins new video.
Today where she tell her subscribers on.
How to cover up cystic acne and it.
Looked so beyond bom i was like so.
Intrigued the entire video but i noticed.
When she got to her highlighter she used.
A fan brush and i just looked so.
Freaking pretty sounds like you know.
What if does he looks hot i want to look.
Hot too so i'm trying this outside and.
Honestly so far i don't actually hate it.
I'm also gonna use this bar so i'm gonna.
Apply it right on the tops of my brow.
Bone on my forehead for that healthy and.
Natural glow okay i'm actually really.
Liking the way that a fan brush applies.
Highlighter this could be like a.
Freaking revelation up in here.
Oh look so pretty i'm gonna go that say.
Behind later on a tiny pencil brush and.
I'm gonna use this to highlight my nose.
Now to finish this look off all we have.
Left is lips i'm first going to the mac.
Strip down liner and just over line my.
Lips the slightest bit to give me a.
Little bit more dimension.
Oh my god these sirens are so annoying.
Music.
Are we done yet nope.
As in for the lips today we're gonna be.
Using the new dose of colors lipstick in.
The shade butterscotch.
Just as orca that's up these slightest.
Bit because we're looking a little bit.
Concealer here right now i'm gonna go.
Into the to face new melted latex liquid.
Gloss stick thing and put it on my lips.
No.
Oh okay so i'm not really sure what you.
Would call this color now that we have.
Put on a lip liner a lipstick and then a.
Gloss over top men wiped off the gloss.
Because we didn't like it but whatever.
Is like lapped on the face right now is.
Exactly what i was going for so i guess.
We're going to leave it all right guys.
So this is the completed kendall jenner.
Inspired look i'm honestly at freaking.
