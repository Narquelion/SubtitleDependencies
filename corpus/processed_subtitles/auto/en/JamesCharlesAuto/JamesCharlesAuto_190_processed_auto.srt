Okay hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back.
To my youtube channel i know i'm not in.
My normal studio setup i really just.
Wanted to pull up the vlog camera super.
Quickly and document this just in case.
This video does become.
A reality if this video is being.
Uploaded and you read the title down.
Below you already know what's happening.
But we have decided to get a best friend.
For.
Finnegan.
Music.
Okay you guys so we are currently in the.
Car on the way to go meet the puppy we.
Have obviously lewis in the back we have.
Eldon driving the vehicle.
Thank god we've already been in the car.
For about 30 minutes we have another.
Basically hour.
To go because of la traffic it's also.
Kind of far away but we are literally so.
Beyond excited louis and i have been.
Talking about wanting to get another dog.
For quite a long time now.
Luis was the one who really brought up.
The idea several months ago.
And i was into the idea but i kept.
Putting it off because.
We were obviously renovating the new.
House and the last thing that i wanted.
To do.
Was adopt a new puppy in a construction.
Zone because that would be a disaster.
And very.
Unsafe period but we are officially in.
The new house we've gotten settled we.
Filmed the house for a video so i feel.
Like it's.
Honestly a good time to bring another.
Dogger to the family yeah.
Finn's also been what's the word uh.
Clinging oh my god so i.
Think it'd be really good um no we love.
It and he'll also.
Feel really excited being able to play.
With someone and keep up that energy.
That he has we also researched the dogs.
That would the breeds that would work.
Best.
Yeah okay let's talk about that okay so.
A lot of people in our lives have french.
Ball dogs including alvin and cassie.
Two two of them and kawa and we love.
Love love them so much and we actually.
Were really interested in getting a.
Frenchie as well.
But alvin was actually telling us about.
Their legs and their.
Like spine because going up and down.
Stairs a lot is not good for them since.
Their bodies are so short yeah.
And obviously we've already done three.
Years in the house three levels do we.
Actually yeah 41 why did you count that.
Because it's a lot of stairs that's.
Obviously our main priorities that.
Obviously the dog has to.
You know fit in with finn to be real i'm.
Not really concerned with it honestly.
Finn.
Has literally gotten along with every.
Dog he's ever come in contact with.
He's the sweetest but ultimately we.
Decided that the breed we really wanted.
To bring into the family was a lab labs.
Are super easy to train they're very.
Friendly family dogs which is.
Very important for us just like with.
Finn we still have people over all the.
Time.
Anyway we have about a 45 minute drive.
Still to go so.
I will obviously keep you guys posted.
And pull the camera whenever we get.
Closer to meeting our new puppy.
But yeah see you guys soon.
Oh my god oh my gosh.
He's adorable hi.
Hey big guy oh my gosh little boop on.
The camera.
Do we need him i think we do.
He's so sweet oh the bracelet's going.
Right for the bracelets.
Expensive taste yeah.
Yeah oh he's walking himself.
Hi big guy little prancer.
All right you guys we are here at the.
Pet store my mask is matching the new.
Puppy and we're gonna go inside and get.
Him some.
Supplies oh hi big guy.
I remember when we first got ben he was.
Pretty chill on the ride home.
But if you guys watch our videos you.
Know the finn does not like the car so.
I'm really really hoping that with this.
Pupper we're able to.
Kind of like warm it up to him a little.
Bit sooner that goes for a lot of things.
Too the pool.
Is one of those things like our.
Opportunity to do everything like even.
Better.
Than we did with finn.
Hey you guys so the puppy's first trip.
To the pet store is complete we got him.
A bed a bunch of different toys and a.
Little crate as well.
He did pee on me slightly in the store.
But you know what it's okay.
Accidents happen and now we have a very.
Very long drive home ahead of us.
How old is he uh eight weeks so you're.
Bringing them home right now.
Yes congratulations.
Thanks guys your grandparents again what.
Is it a male or female it's a boy.
He's so tired he's pretty calm actually.
He's really calm hello.
Music.
Okay you guys we've officially made it.
Home the pepper literally slept.
All the way and now we are about to.
Bring him inside and introduce him to.
Finn.
I should go in first and be on finn's.
Side yeah and i definitely think so.
You can bring him in and drop him down.
Okay why don't you go in we'll.
Let him smell me okay here we go hey big.
Guy.
Oh my god oh my god he smells him oh my.
God he's losing his mind.
I really think that it's gonna be okay.
Finn is obviously such a good little.
Angel he's the sweetest everybody.
Oh my goodness he has been like our baby.
For a year now and i.
Just don't know how he's going to react.
Having somebody else getting attention.
Oh my goodness are you excited good.
Point good boy.
Set go forward good boy stay stay okay.
Stay.
Okay.
Music.
Me oh sure finn how do you feel about.
This so far he is so cute.
Oh my god finn just really really wants.
To play what the problem is he doesn't.
Know how big he is.
It's crazy because alvin's two french.
Bulldogs are the ones that usually are.
Playing with finn but they are like.
Literal tasmanian devils just like.
Zooming everywhere bumping into each.
Other like head first like crazy.
So finn's not used to like playing.
Gently oh he's really climbing those.
Stairs.
Very athletic oh.
My god hey.
Good boy okay you guys the puppy's.
Having his first.
Meal little finn is watching from the.
Background being a good little boy.
Hi snooper we have the food that he was.
Already eating then we also have the.
Same brand that finn.
Um is usually on we mix in a little bit.
Of uh finn's brand into his.
So we can ease him in so the guys are on.
The same food he just took a little.
Nap and fell asleep on me while i was.
Watching a new episode of rupaul's drag.
Race at vegas review which is.
So entertaining by the way i hope that.
That doesn't mess up his sleeping.
Schedule because.
I remember the first night with finn was.
A nightmare.
Fingers crossed that it'll be all good.
I'll play a little bit more tonight.
Before we go to bed and then he will.
Knock out and be ready to go again.
Tomorrow morning now it is time for our.
Dinner.
Trevor just lovely wet and go hello.
What's our shot called crossroads it's a.
Nice vegan restaurant and normally i.
Don't love vegan food to be honest with.
You but we went a few nights ago for.
Trevor's birthday dinner and it was.
So good oh my god it was literally some.
Of the best food that i've ever eaten.
It's bad oh did you finish your food oh.
My god.
Oh no no that's finn's bowl no no sir.
Okay so end of day one he's got finn's.
Precious cow.
He's not having it getting along really.
Well they're much calmer.
Than they were in the beginning right.
Finn.
He's eating his ass we all would if we.
Could.
Music.
He's brave he's like running right into.
Thin so.
Like is this even real oh my god.
This was such an amazing and beautiful.
Day i am so excited that we actually.
Ended up getting him.
Wow the next day last night i did the.
Unthinkable.
I had the pup sleep with me in my bed.
Because he's.
So cute and so cuddly and he's been.
Really good about his potty training so.
I wanted to see if he'd be able to.
Do it oh my gosh i wanted to see if he'd.
Be able to do it and spend the whole.
Night with me in bed and not go to the.
Bathroom and he did he's such a good boy.
He is however a very very um like a.
Squirmish sleeper so we did wake up a.
Few different times in the middle of the.
Night just because he kept like.
Re-adjusting himself which was.
A little annoying but other than that.
You did a good job baby you did a good.
Job.
Applause.
This is not an optional assignment.
He's so cute in fin.
What oh do you want a bath now.
Or you just want to join the party i.
Think we need to make a double bath.
You did this you did this.
War oh no oh no.
Oh no oh oh.
Oh oh okay so obviously i talked about.
How finn is like extremely attached to.
Lewis and i he's very very just.
Protective and loving but he's also not.
An aggressive dog.
Literally at all like we've never even.
Heard finn growl like out of anger since.
We got him which is.
Great but with the puppy the puppy's.
Obviously in his teething face because.
He's only a few weeks old and he keeps.
Like biting me and lewis and i've.
Noticed whenever he starts like biting.
Me and i'll like say no.
Like just like push him away a little.
Bit finn will like come.
Walk in the middle of myself and the.
Puppy so the puppy like can't.
Get to me to bite me which is like i.
Think finn protecting me it really seems.
Like finn.
Is like honestly helping train the pup.
Which is like.
Makes my heart so happy and also like.
The best thing that could have ever.
Happened.
Next time that that is like happening.
I'll try to get it on camera because i.
Really would love.
The input of you guys like anybody else.
Who has dogs out there to explain what's.
Going on i could be really overthinking.
This but.
I think finn is really like handling.
This super super well.
The next day all right you guys you've.
Been having a rough day with this little.
One.
So far he has not been the best angel.
But i want to try and take him.
Swimming and see how that goes finn.
Hates the water and we're reading online.
To see if it was safe for him we found.
Out that it's okay to start introducing.
Puppies to water around eight weeks.
Which is exactly how old he is.
And my thought process is that hopefully.
If we get him introduced to water.
Earlier on.
He might like it labs and gold.
Retrievers are both really good natural.
Swimmers.
So let's see hot tub is not on for.
Anyone wondering.
We're not cooking him.
Oh my god he's good yeah that was really.
Good it's okay.
Oh i know you don't want to join we know.
You can't tell if he likes it or not.
He's like willingly swimming how do we.
Get our dogs to light the water can.
Somebody leave us a comment down below.
And tell us how to warm our dogs up to.
The water.
Finn's literally horrified and like this.
One seems to be okay but i don't think.
He's loving it oh he's not thrilled.
Maybe if you like hold his like.
Rib cage area and he can just practice.
The motion finn's loving us he's getting.
Treats for doing nothing.
Hopefully whenever we're in the pool if.
We just take the puppy in for a little.
Bit he'll get used to it and we'll enjoy.
It and we'll definitely give you guys a.
Puff date on the swimming.
Hi you all watching the vmas you're.
Watching the video music world all.
Together as a lovely family.
Oh please don't bite me ouch ouch kind.
Of kisses instead.
Are you giving me kisses you're gonna.
Bite me because i'll find you back oh.
You do not want that breath in your.
Mouth.
The next day hello you guys so this.
Morning i had a cute little vlog clip of.
Me waking up with the pepper.
He slept perfectly last night did not go.
To the bathroom was an angel.
And i have not filmed anything yet today.
Because um i've literally spent the.
Entire day.
With this one trying to fix him because.
Oh boy the excitement that i had for how.
Well he was behaved.
Last night quickly diminished when he.
Decided to pee inside of the house.
Four different times today not once not.
Twice not thrice but.
It's only two o'clock as well we are.
Super frustrated and also just confused.
Because for the past few days he's been.
Doing such a good job of using the.
Bathroom outside waiting for the door to.
Open but i don't know what it is.
Now he needs to go for redemption every.
Main character needs a redemption arc.
Lauren knows they've had mine so why is.
He being so bad today.
That is the name of a cartoon character.
Boy so the other dog has to match that.
Which is why i think theo is the perfect.
Name.
Terrible is such a good name a very.
Exotic.
Foreign boy hot chiseled boy what yeah.
And theo is the same body harley's a.
Great name and.
He's a girl of dogs harley leonardo.
Leonardo's really good.
I love the ninja turtles and leonardo.
Dicaprio i'm sure you guys enjoy.
Everyone listen hi here we go leo harley.
Scout no yep what were mine.
Girl don't do it it's not worth it i'm.
Not gonna do it girl.
I was just thinking about it i'm not.
Gonna do it.
I did it perfect.
Good boy thank you all right you guys.
Well i think that is everything that we.
Have for today's new video i'm so glad.
That we got to introduce this little.
Baby right here to all of you guys and.
He's now officially part of the family.
It has been an insane past couple of.
Days he definitely has quite a lot of.
Work to do.
Finn this little angel right here was.
Definitely quite a lot easier but i'm.
Always down for a challenge and.
That just means he's gonna be a very.
Very strong spirited individual.
