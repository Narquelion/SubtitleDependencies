Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel.
Before we jump into today's video i want.
To play a really fun game of spot.
The difference ready go.
Do you see it yet yeah yesterday i broke.
A nail and if you were a fellow acrylic.
Nail wear like i am you would know that.
This is already one of the worst.
Things to ever happen but what's even.
Worse about breaking a nail.
Is when you break a nail and you don't.
Know when it happened and you don't know.
How it happened and you don't even have.
The rest of it to glue it back.
Together i called my nail tech and this.
Morning i have an appointment which.
Brings me to today's video because.
I wanted to do something kind of fun and.
Also a little bit.
Uh scary i figured it was time to spice.
It up try something new and especially.
Since i broke the nail yesterday and had.
To have my nail tech.
Come back i'm going to be trying out.
Living with extremely long nails.
For 24 hours so i've been seeing so many.
Really amazing talented artists like.
Cardi b.
I know sweetie has really long nails in.
Our top end music video and.
Nail art and like growth is kind of like.
A trend and like a community in itself.
So i figured.
I would dive in for one day and one day.
Only because i have a feeling this is.
Going to be very.
Very challenging and i'm going to see if.
I can survive for 24 hours with.
Extremely long acrylic.
Nails let's get started.
Music.
Okay right so it's currently 10 11 in.
The morning and we're going to walk out.
Of the studio and into the.
Sister salon oh my god i cannot wait to.
Give you guys the house tour my amazing.
Nail tech.
John is already here and set up and.
We're ready to go.
Hey okay so we are obviously doing crazy.
Long nails today yeah do you do long.
Nails very often.
Um he's having a conversation excuse me.
How do you feel about the long nose are.
You ready for some scratches.
Do you do super long nose very often i.
Do have certain clients that prefer.
Extra extra long yeah part of me yeah.
She's like probably.
One of the one of my clients that.
Prefers the longest i wonder how.
How long is that going to take okay so.
Depending how long you want.
We're going to be like like.
Applause.
What are some things that he has to like.
Look forward to with the long nails well.
We'll probably have to do like a.
Kind of tutorial i'm not concerned with.
Like wiping my butt.
Typing i'm sure they'll be challenging.
But i'll figure it out i'm more.
Concerned that i'll break one.
You um no you can slap people.
And be in fights and stuff and you'll be.
All right oh sure.
So that's nail number one huh that's.
Number one.
God show the camera real quick oh.
That's already that's double the length.
Of my fingers literally so being on your.
Little pinky.
Okay let's go.
Oh my god oh my god put it together.
Oh the difference in life holy crap.
Three.
Hours later.
Oh my god it's really been quite a while.
Okay what time is it how long.
One one thirty two three hours three.
Hours three hours.
Yet okay i was thinking because i.
Watched my.
Try to wash my hands for the first time.
Before the video we're obviously trying.
Out lots of fun things right.
Sure said we wanted to drive we said we.
Wanted to of course eat and we also said.
We need to.
You know uh yeah private.
The bathroom here really good way to you.
Know.
Kill three words of one stone would be.
To go to chick-fil-a.
Actually killed three birds finn.
Well i was thinking obviously we have to.
Drive to get there and i'll get the.
Spicy chicken sandwich which will.
Definitely cause some bowel movements.
And then go to the bathroom and then.
Oh should i pet the puppy oh come here.
Come here oh my gosh he's terrified.

Okay so like i said earlier it's.
Currently 2 p.m i am.
Starving we have not eaten yesterday so.
I want to get a pair of socks on and.
Drive to chick-fil-a.
I'm a little bit concerned with the idea.
Of putting on socks.
I was just you know in the bathroom.
Urinating it took me a good.
30 seconds to figure out how to pull my.
Pants down.
Um get out of breath not really out of.
Breath it's just more um.
Thinking sure i'm not sure how to get.
This over oh wait wait look.
Okay yeah it's looking a little tricky.
This is gonna be re-uploaded to like.
Butt hub or something.
That's fine okay that took like four.
Minutes to get on top.
Process oh my god.
Music.
I don't want to meet him with these oh.

Scared to even touch them.
Scratch them by accident nails oh my god.
These are so.
Sick.

And get the nice laces out oh that came.
In handy for so long that definitely.
Worked.
One hour later let's really use the nail.

Playing with noodles.
Hey hey 20 minutes later oh.

Hour up here just to drop these off they.

The nails we'll definitely get rid of.
Those before oh no.
Okay so oh well i was gonna say how to.
Open the door but luckily the tesla.
Opens it for me.
Let's put my seatbelt on.
That was a good palm thrust.
Music.
Okay so when your nails like grow or.
Obviously in this situation just get.
Three inches longer your depth.
Perception gets really messed up because.
You're used to.
Rubbing things reaching for things or.
Touching things at a specific distance.
Away from them.
I'm like completely off balance of like.
Where my things are also i just realized.
I could be talking with so much emphasis.
This entire time.
Oh that's a lot of emphasis i'm gonna.
Make that girl on tick tock don't be.
Content.
When you can have better you feel me if.
You want to fly high you gotta let go of.
What's weighing you down good morning.
Everybody just wanted to let you all.

And we are perfectly safe i'm gonna take.
The mask off so i can talk to you guys.
It's very nice that chris from breakout.
Said that he loved the nails it was even.
Cuter as well that the girls that.
Chick-fil-a noticed them right away and.
Said that they love them i think that.
That's very very cute and honestly i.
Think that was like the confidence.
Booster that i needed.
To get through the rest of today a.
Little mukbang.
Music.
Just really wedge it in there oh.
No not a puncture not a puncture.
Okay how do i open the sauce i think.
Just jab a nail in it and then lick it.
Off.
Music.
Oh give her a good grip.
Oh no well it looks so tiny because your.
Fingers are so big.
Don't say that well just because the.
Nails.
Is that how you normally hold it no how.
Do you normally hold it.
Oh yeah too much overlap now really.
Intertwined.
Together oh no.
All right you guys we are officially.
Down here in the makeup studio because i.
Really wanted to film some tech talks.
Today.
With these nails now i am not looking.
Forward to.
This glam process so this should be.
Really interesting.
I'm gonna grab the milk hydro grip.
Primer give a nice.
Squirt onto my hands i literally just.
Got lasik and fixed my vision and i'm.
Gonna accidentally poke myself in the.
Eye and be blind okay so now foundation.
I'm gonna do some squirts on the back of.
My hand i do like that my nails also.
Doing the pump as well.
I'm not really sure how to hold this can.
You hold it with your nails only.
Music.
Oh no this can you guys this cannot be.
Real.
Well that kind of works okay i'm gonna.
Do some cream contouring.
I'm just gonna do a little bit of a.
Concealer.
This is the ugliest i've ever looked in.
My entire life oh my stomach is starting.
To really.
Turn make some questionable noises you.
Guys are like actually concerned about.
My plans.
Music.

I have to poop no i have to trevor i.
Said i could feel it brewing.
We i have to go.
Okay have fun in there oh okay well okay.
Okay.
Okay i'm gonna poop and i will uh.
Talk to you guys in a second okay so.
This is.
Far more personal than i ever thought.
I'd be getting on youtube but here goes.
Nothing it's got some nice strands of.
Toilet paper.
Um like wrap my hand in it.
Oh my gosh okay like this.
Okay this is the worst thing for my.
Entire life why am i doing a tutorial on.
This.
Okay i'm holding it up and then just.
Like placing it in there.
And i'm like so like obviously i'll make.
This right here but i just move myself.
With the last second just really hope it.
Sticks there.
Music.
All right just in case i missed a little.
Bit it's disgusting.
Really getting all the nuts and crannies.
We have around here.
There's so many fun questions about my.
Bathroom trip did you pierce the toilet.
Paper with the nail at any point.
No i did not by the amount of times that.
I folded it just in case of an emergency.
Oh it was about 50 for apply i'm just.
Going to throw on some highlighter and.
Then.
Probably call it a day soon because i'm.
Getting bored.
I don't want to do this anymore it's too.
Hard.
This is the way to really peck my nose.
Ew oh.
Stop saying it was if you don't pick.
Your nose everyone picks their nose not.
In public.
Oops oh ew did you just see that that.
Disgusting fly should try to.
Snatch it with your nails i just catch.
It right in there.
Yeah really lock it into the cage i.
Don't want to put on lashes.
Okay you guys well it is exactly six.
O'clock p.m right now which means this.
Glam process took me almost.
Two hours on a normal day i could get.
This done in probably 30 to 45 minutes.
Maximum but because of these nails i've.
Been sitting here for two hours i am.
So bored i am so over it i hate just.
Like not getting things done and i feel.
Like this is.
Such a waste of time it's just a.
Struggle.
So now that the makeup is all oh wow.
It's right outside luckily i have lots.
Of surface area to cover the sun with my.
Nice long nail true we're gonna take an.
Instagram photo.
With the nails this is bob.
This is bob.
I am holding the phone with the nails.
Interesting you really probably don't.
Even need the pop socket anymore with.
All that grip.
I know he should do you should do a put.
A finger down oh my god.
Put a finger down if you decided that.
It'd be really fun to film a youtube.
Video where you try to live for 24 hours.
With extremely long fingernails and you.
Think that filming this video is gonna.
Be a piece of cake because you have.
Nails on it literally all the time.
But then you try to start doing your.
Daily tasks such as tying your shoes and.
Writing back to business emails and you.
Literally can't do anything at all.
You realize that your stomach is like.
Kind of grumbling and feels a little bit.
Weird and you realize that you really.
Have to go to the bathroom.
So you go poop and then you realize that.
You actually have to wipe your butt and.
You have a full on panic attack because.
You realize you can't do it.
And you start crying because you're not.
Technically gonna be there for another.
Four hours to take them off.
James what are you doing.
Why are you taking your makeup off i'm.
Over the stage i literally i'm free i'm.
Like actually starting to.
Get really anxious with just oh lots of.
Anger is happening.
I have not been able to respond back to.
Any texts today i have not been able to.
Send any emails or taking my laptop.
Which is very much stressing me out.
These are gorgeous they're fun to look.
At and they were fun to.
Really tap out or do some nice asmr at.
First but now i am very much over there.
I'm supposed to come back tomorrow.
Morning to take these off so it would.
Like actually be 24 hours.
But i like i honestly i can't do it so.
Thank.
God he's on his way back right now.
Or guys that can so we'll start right.
Here just in case you want to keep a.
Little wind.
Sure oh.
My oh lord i need to wear.
Armor the thickness that took an inch.
There.
Holy crap all right you guys.
This has been quite the day as you can.
See.
Just left and we are back to our normal.
Length of nails on.
Just want to share some quick thoughts.
My overall sentiments my feelings first.
Of all i just want to say a major shout.
Out to john for.
Being here for literally like six hours.
In total today working on these nails i.
Don't know.
What was really going on i honestly feel.
Like the best way to describe the.
Feeling that i was experiencing was like.
Claustrophobia.
In a way if that makes literally any.
Sense i have so much respect for the.
Nail attacks that do.
Nails like that all the time the girls.
That wear nose like that all the time.
They are so beautiful they are such an.
Art form and if you are able to actually.
Function in your daily life with those.
Nails.
More power to you because i obviously.
Could not but all that being said this.
Is quite the experience and i did have a.
Whole lot of fun.
Trying this out for the first time ever.
