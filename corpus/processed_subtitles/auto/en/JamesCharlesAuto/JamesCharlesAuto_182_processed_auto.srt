Hi sisters two sprouts here and welcome.
Back to our youtube channel of course.
That enter normally comes before my.
Videos but i felt like this one was.
Appropriate to just kind of go right.
Into things i really hope you guys.
Enjoyed this little song moment that.
Just happened there for today's video.
There's been a huge trend going around.
Recently where different youtubers are.
Making their own districts and you guys.
Know me i definitely love a bit of self.
Roast this morning i was actually.
Pulling through hate comments getting.
Ready to record a thing you may hate.
Comments video inspired by colleen.
Ballinger and everybody else who is.
Doing this trend including at gabby.
Hannah and laurdiy and literally writing.
This first some reason just kept getting.
More and more and more deep this is kind.
Of sauce to be a light-hearted moment.
But i kind of realized said hey comments.
Are a really really serious topic and i.
Know a lot of youtubers including myself.
All the time like to pretend like they.
Don't really get to us and that we're.
Above them and that were just happy.
Positive people but in reality they do.
Get to us sometimes and they've really.
Shaped me to be who i am today and both.
A good way and unfortunately bad ways.
Too but it is really important to focus.
On the love and positivity because of.
You guys i've really been able to be the.
Person i am today and your comments have.
Been able to keep me positive if they're.
Really really really dark times all.
These comments are very very real and.
These are words and phrases and things.
That i have to read every single day on.
Content that i am really really proud of.
And work really really hard at and i.
Know it may seem like being youtubers.
Such an easy job but if you really strip.
Everything away we're just kids sitting.
Behind a camera and trying our best make.
Other people happy and to keep ourselves.
Inspired and at the end of the day it's.
So much easier to just spread love and.
Positivity and not be me and i urge you.
Guys every single day to do the same.
