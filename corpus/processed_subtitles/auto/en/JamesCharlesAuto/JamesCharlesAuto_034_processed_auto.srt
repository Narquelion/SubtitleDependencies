Hi brothers.
I'm james and i'm ian and welcome back.
To brother and sister.
Sister brother brother and sister sister.
Brother i can't talk like this for long.
As brother and sister that's your.
Brother.
Okay whatever.
For today's episode we thought it would.
Be really good.
And fun so in case you have not been on.
Youtube for the past.
Year you may have missed probably the.
Biggest trend.
Of all time first of all you're doing it.
Wrong.
When you talk you have to go like that.
That happens later no.
It goes on for today's episode.
We're gonna be doing asmr if you can.
Already tell.
Because we're whispering so it's.
Probably obvious.
Ninety percent of the heat comments i.
Get on my videos on a daily basis.
Are that people hate my voice and to.
Those comments i say.
I agree so this should be really fun.
Um and hopefully you really like my.
Voice if i'm not.
Really talking so that's good that's.
Kind of all the way around.
Shhh it's kind of the other way around.
For me what do you mean.
Like people like my voice like oh my god.
Your voice is so deep it's not true.
Right sorry guys you're not gonna be.
Hearing much.
So i've really only watched a few asmr.
Videos and i'm going to be honest going.
Into this.
I have not really gotten the tingles.
From them.
I know that they do actually help a lot.
Of people with anxiety and with stress.
For me they help me in a different way.
Which is.
Laughing at comedy yes for today's video.
We thought it'd be really fun.
To go into this with an open mind and.
Really try to.
Make it tingle for a real one.
We are going to just be talking and.
Interacting.
And we're a sister starting so probably.
Gonna order some food.
And do a mukbang together wait wait.
So hopefully we catch a good and you.
Just.
Tingle for a real one so.
That's girl wait what even is asmr.
Good question i google that asmr.
Stands for autonomous sensory meridian.
Response i don't know what two of those.
Words mean.
It's an experience characterized like a.
Static.
Like or tingling sensation on the skin.
That typically begins on the scalp and.
Posed at the back of the neck and upper.
Spine.
I'm scared.
Music.
Don't touch me i'll still hate you in.
Asmr form.
So delicious and refreshing.

How's your chicken chicken.
Let us know in the comments do you enjoy.
Watching asmr videos because.
While i'm filming this i feel like i.
Feel very creepy.
And weird i'm uncomfortable and yeah but.
It's kind of fun and fresh it kind of is.
I'm gonna take a bite of this crunchy.
Chicken slab of.
Meat it's kind of not that crunchy.
Though because it's kind of this one.
This one's crunchy.
This is so weird.
This is the weirdest thing i've ever.
Recorded in my life.
And i have to be quiet but i feel like.
Now the whole world is at like this.
Talking level.
So adding a loud noise sounds weird.
It's kind of scary like i feel like when.
We leave here i'll still be whispering.
Oh my god it's like that movie um a.
Quiet place.
Music.
Hopefully the microphone picks that up.
And you guys got to tinkle to my.
Grumbles.
