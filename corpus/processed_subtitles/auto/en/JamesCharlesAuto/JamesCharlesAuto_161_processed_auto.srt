Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel so it.
Is officially october i am so excited.
For the fall and for all the cute little.
Pumpkin spice lattes and sweaters but.
Most importantly i don't care what day.
Of the month it is this month is.
Halloween the entire bar i definitely.
Plan on doing a ton of different.
Halloween looks for you guys so.
Definitely make comment down below and.
Tell me what you want to see me do for.
This halloween but for today's look our.
Very first one i did this half face neon.
Light up skull inspired makeup look and.
I am honestly it's so so hard to be how.
It turned out i think it just looked so.
So sick it definitely was not the.
Easiest makeup look i've never done it.
Took a very long time and a lot of.
Concentration but i feel like it's not.
That hard you just have to be a really.
Really patient and be willing to take.
Your time - something that i definitely.
Struggle with but hey we came with okay.
Today by the waves today's look is.
Inspired by the wigs and makeup manager.
On instagram she does so many beautiful.
And stunning skeleton makeup books do.
You guys have to check her out all right.
All that being said happy halloween.
Everybody grab your piketty drink at.
Ease and let's get started.
Music.
Alright guys so i already went ahead and.
I primed my face off-camera as always.
Using my favorite moisturizer but before.
We actually go in with the makeup i want.
To pry my lips and for today's video i.
Partnered with yoos to show you guys.
Their brand new crystal lip balm.
Basically this lip balm acts as like a.
Moisturizing primer underneath the.
Makeup and it just wax for you so it.
Feels super super lately on the lips.
Which is great because we're gonna be.
Putting a lot of makeup on today so we.
Don't want it to feel very very heavy.
And it also can needs a lot of natural.
Ingredients like shea butter and coconut.
Oil which makes for a really really long.
Lasting hydrating feeling which is so so.
Good like i said everybody putting on a.
Lot of face paint and.
And liner onto my lips today which is.
Not saying that i normally do and it.
Tends to get really really really dry so.
This is just gonna make sure those lips.
Last all day long and are super super.
Comfortable to wear so now that we are.
All primed and ready to go like i said.
We were gonna be wearing a lot a lot a.
Lot of makeup today so i'm gonna quickly.
Go ahead and do my base up camera as.
Well as my eyebrows to save some time.
And then i'll be right back to sur off.
The eyes okay so jumping bright and i.
Have my base already completely on it.
This video is obviously gonna be focused.
On the eye makeup and the skeleton.
Portion so i figured might as well just.
Save some time and for my eyes today i'm.
Gonna start off using my morphe 35o.
Palette i use this palette so much in.
All my videos you guys have heard me say.
This a million times but it is surely my.
All-time favorite palette for a color.
Looks and i'm gonna be using all these.
Of blue shades in the left-hand row i'm.
Gonna start off by carving an m 4-3-3.
Bet and typing into this light blue.
Shade up in here and use that to start a.
Transition shade i'm going in with a.
Very very light hand because a blue eye.
Shadow does tend to be very hard to.
Blend out and i do want this to look.
Good obviously i mean duh so i'm just.
Gonna blend this very very carefully.
Making sure that this doesn't get too.
High up into like the brow increase.
Region and just keeping the shadow.
Mostly concentrated in the crease i am.
Taking what's left of that shadow on the.
Brush and just winging it out as well.
There's obviously gonna be a lot going.
On in the mouth region with all the.
Skeleton makeup so i definitely make.
Sure it's balanced on the eye portion.
And this is gonna be a lot of dimension.
A lot of different colors going on it so.
I feel like weighing this out and making.
The shadows really really blown out and.
Wide with a lot of different shades and.
Dimension is just going to like really.
Even off this low neck so i'm gonna grab.
07 brush and dip into this.
Darker blue shade in the top left hand.
And use that to darken up the crease in.
The outer corner.
Then i'm just gonna grab my own 4-3-3.
That i had that light blue shade on and.
Use this to lightly buff over those.
Edges make sure everything is super.
Blended out copy that same m 507 brush.
That i used for this blue i'm gonna dip.
Into this darker blue shade in the.
Bottom and use this to deepen it up even.
More at this point you guys have low.
Base you may do a million half cut.
Creases i was reading through this.
Pretty quickly just because there is.
Gonna be a lot of work and color going.
Into the bottom half of the face being.
The skull so just follow along the best.
You possibly can or watch another two.
Turtle on a half cup crease i'm.
Basically just doing a full on blue one.
And then guard my m 506 i'm gonna dip.
Into the slightest bit of black from the.
Bottom of the palette and i mean slight.
You need to be so careful here can't.
Even tell you how many times i've messed.
Up an entire look with black shadow so.
Only grab a little bit and then once.
Again going with the next darkest blue.
Shade and using that to blend it oh now.
That the shadows are all laid out and.
Blended and decide now i am so happy.
Because the blue shadows for me are.
Usually really really tricky but today.
This looks so good and blended so thank.
God the makeup cards are in my paper.
Today but moving on normally to cut my.
Crease i would use my a tarp shaped a.
Concealer as all of you guys know but.
That has a tan base obviously so instead.
I'm gonna use my kat von d lock-it.
Concealer in the shade whiteout today.
Just because i want this a cut crease to.
Be like white as opposed to like a tan.
Color so you can overlay it with a.
Glitter in a second.
And then i'm just going to set that.
Concealer in place using my sugar pill.
Single shadow in the shade taco and then.
Finally for an extra pop i'm gonna grab.
My mac reflux teal and my morphe m two.
To four brush and i'm gonna spritz it.
Using some fix+ and then pack a little.
Bit of this on to the later purchase a.
Nice pop of blue for the lower lash then.
07 and dip into the.
Medium blue shade in the top and just.
Start to buff out the lower lash you.
Guys always know when it comes to doing.
A half cut creases i always like to.
Bring this shadow in the very inner.
Corner on the lower lash line forward as.
Opposed to following my natural eye.
Shape this is a very drag technique but.
I love how it makes my eyes look a lot.
More open and wide driving my original.
I'm four three three brush i'm gonna use.
This to buff out that bottom edge and.
Then finally i'm gonna grab an m 213 and.
Dip this in the absolute darkest blue.
And then just push this right into the.
Lashes so that is what i all complete.
Obviously i'm gonna add a mascara and.
Lashes towards the end of the look but.
Everything else is gonna take me a.
Long-ass time and i don't want to have.
To deal with these charcoal up wearing.
Lashes for the next several hours so i'm.
Gonna go ahead and do the other eye.
Off-camera quickly and i'll be right.
Back to start off the skeleton and then.
We'll put on the lashes and stuff later.
On now we get to move on to the fun part.
Of this tutorial and that is the half.
Base skeleton look next in occur have.
Any white eyeliner pencil this one is.
From a morphe in the shade.
Coconut and i'm gonna start sketching.
Out the highlights of a skull.
I have a picture pulled up on my phone.
Right here that i'm looking at a lot of.
Times when you do skeleton makeup you.
Usually start with black to do like the.
Shadows but instead today we're focusing.
On the highlight so really make sure.
Your toning into the light and the.
Darkness up the photo to really make.
Sure we achieve this effect correctly.
Okay so my camera died and i didn't.
Catch it i mean imagine that we really.
Surprised at this point but what i did.
Is i started off with my two top front.
Teeth and sketched those in and then.
Just started out from there making my.
Teeth get smaller and smaller as i get.
Out to the molars out of the corner and.
Then i'm just gonna do the same exact.
Thing on my bottom lip and then taking a.
Break from the mouth from one second.
Then just gonna trace my cheekbone.
If you make a mistake it's okay don't.
Worry about it that's why we're starting.
Off with this white eyeliner basically.
This entire top line that i just made.
Was completely wrong so i'm just going.
To grab my beauty blender and quickly.
Try to go over as best as i can.
But it's gonna be hidden in a few.
Seconds anyway because of the shadow and.
Stuff that were gonna be putting on.
There so i'm gonna go ahead and redraw.
That now and then finally placing one.
Really long line to trace up my jawline.
And yes i am definitely being a lot more.
Sharp and chiseled than normal.
Definitely does not hurt to fool the eye.
A little bit then i'm gonna start to.
Sketch in my nose and then remember.
Normally i know when we do a skull we.
Usually focus on the shadows first being.
In the blackshades flat first today we.
Need to do the whites first just make.
Sure we get those highlights all in.
Place before we place the shadows later.
On so just kind of think the opposite of.
What you would normally sketch so i'm.
Just kind of sketching a white outline.
Of where the nose would normally be if.
That makes sense now i'm just going to.
Quickly go ahead and mirror that same.
Exact white lines on the other side i.
Just went ahead and i drew out all the.
Lines and once again don't worry if it's.
Not perfect you can always fix anything.
Up with concealer and we're about to.
Blend the crap out of it anyway so this.
Is just to get a rough baseline but now.
That everything is roughly on i'm gonna.
Remember three threes that i use for my.
Eye crease and back into my at 35 beat.
Palette you guessed it and dip into this.
Bright blue shade and serve to blend out.
All those white lines i'm also gonna.
Grab a clean m5 13 brush or any big.
Fluffy brush and just go over those.
Edges to make sure they're not too.
Intense then i'm just gonna go ahead and.
Repeat this for literally every single.
White line that i've already drawn okay.
So this way we're looking absolutely.
Ridiculous trust me i know it's gonna.
Get better in a second don't worry.
There's a lot of layering that needs to.
Really go into this look to make sure it.
Looks really really realistic what i'm.
Gonna do is grab a slightly domed hacker.
Brush into the same indian blue shade.
Once again and i pack this on into the.
Same exact areas tracing over where.
Those white lines were originally and.
This is just gonna help add a lot more.
To bend into the white lines once we add.
Them in next i'm gonna do the same exact.
Thing on the nose and the teeth as well.
But i'm gonna use my m14 and i'm just a.
Tiny fluffy pencil brush and said just.
Make sure it's more defined.
Okay so now that we have all the blue in.
Place next we're gonna go in with the.
Black and this is where we have to be.
Really really careful and really precise.
Or else is gonna start looking a really.
Messy and really wonky real fast i'm.
Gonna start out by gary miami 506 brush.
Which is that same brush we used in.
Black to deepen up the crease and i'm.
Gonna dip it right back into the black.
With a 35 b i'm gonna start to really.
Lightly fill in these areas in between.
The blue where there is no light what.
I'm gonna do next grab ie.
37 brush and dip once again into that.
Black shade and use this to add it to.
Mention into the teeth region because.
Using a faulty brush in there would be a.
Disaster alright and now that the block.
Is all in place i told you guys this is.
Gonna be a long one i'm gonna go miami.
Five thirteen which is my blending brush.
To blend that blue out and i'm gonna dip.
This into the teal and i'm gonna get a.
Lot of it on there and i'm gonna go.
Right over top of those lines one more.
Time to blend together the blue and the.
Black this step is basically to.
Eliminate any tan skin left showing in.
This region okay so now that we have the.
Black and blue in place finally our last.
Step is going to be to add the.
Highlights which makes this like.
Actually neon and today i'm gonna be.
Using the white mixed liquid liner i'm.
Gonna be super careful here because this.
Took a lot of time but all i'm gonna do.
Is just trace a thin white line right.
Over the center most bluest point of all.
The blue lines and that's going to.
Create that neon sign effect.
Just for an action little touch because.
At this point why not i'm gonna grab an.
Emma for for one or just any fluffy.
Blending brush and dip the tiniest bit.
Into the mac reflux teal spreads a.
Little bit of it with some fix+.
And then just tap this pigment right.
Over top of those highlighted areas.
Finally to finish off the hook i'm gonna.
Pop on the new bounce of lashes in the.
Style dragon lee and you can use code.
James for 20% off all their lashes all.
Right sisters and that is this hot faced.
Neon skeleton makeup all complete i.
Absolutely love how this turned out it.
