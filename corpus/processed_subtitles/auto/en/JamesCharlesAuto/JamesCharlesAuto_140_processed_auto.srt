Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel in.
Case you notice everything you might.
Look a little bit different right now i.
Slightly changed my setup and my letting.
A little bit.
I made the lights a lot less bright and.
Added a lot more diffusion so now i'll.
Hopefully be able to open my eyes and.
Not blink and close them every 3 seconds.
Come on camera i've got so many comments.
About it i know it's annoying.
You guys have no idea how much frickin.
Light was surrounding me in my previous.
Video so hopefully you guys like this.
Whole lot better but let me know a.
Sister is working on it anyways for.
Today's that i have something very very.
Fun plan that i'm actually so excited to.
Try out i've been seeing so many.
Youtubers lately doing videos testing.
Out mixing their different products.
I saw sophia    testing up mixing her.
Foundation first and then she tested out.
Mixing her liquid lipsticks to get a.
Funky color so for today's video i'm.
Trying something a little bit different.
And i'm gonna mix together all of my.
Setting powders if you guys been a.
Longtime sister you know that setting.
Powder is a little bit of a touchy.
Subject for me when i first started.
Doing my makeup i use the cote air.
Somehow too religiously and we all know.
How that turned out so this one is.
Slowly made its way out of my routine.
Now i use the laura mercier translucent.
Setting powder in almost every single.
Video but i've tried out so many.
Different powders in between some of the.
Remotes have mattify some of them are.
Meant to brighten some of them prevent.
Creases but overall the whole purpose of.
Them is that they set the face in place.
Today i'm gonna be mixing together all.
My setting powders they have in my.
Collection both my favorites and the.
Ones that have given me a little bit of.
Trouble in the past and this empty.
Setting powder container we're gonna mix.
Them all together and then we're gonna.
Set my face in place that actually kind.
Of hurt i'm really not sure how this is.
Gonna turn out just on my first thoughts.
I am assuming that it's probably gonna.
Be ridiculously dry like it's a hair.
Desert level i do have my setting spray.
Just in case everything gets a little.
Bit too serious or my face is like you.
Know cracking off because won't be that.
Big of a surprise but who knows i also.
Feel like i probably i'm gonna get.
Pretty bad a flashback today hopefully.
Mary will not come back to play i do.
Have to wear this makeup to an event.
Later on tonight but i'll be taking you.
Guys with me to show the full thing i'll.
Also be taking a lot of photos so.
Hopefully none of them turn out too bad.
Anyways all being said if you'd like to.
See all my setting powders being mixed.
Together put them to the test.
Will it work will it fail will flash.
Like mary make an iconic appearance keep.
On watching.
Music.
So before i actually go into my.
Foundation today my first step is gonna.
Be to go into the touch of water cream.
Which is my all-time favorite.
Moisturizer as i was just talking about.
Obviously the whole point of setting.
Powder is to dry foundation down and sat.
Waiting in place and i definitely do not.
Want to be the sahara desert.
Today my skin is just arting to clear up.
A little bit so i'm trying to protect it.
Therefore i need to be really really.
Hydrated before i suck all the moisture.
Out for foundations today i'm gonna grab.
My all-time favorite my makeup for ever.
Ultra hd stick and this is in the shade.
Of y 335 i am using a stick shade that's.
Slightly darker than my normal shade for.
Them i do have a bad feeling this is.
Gonna give me a really bad a flashback.
Today so i'm trying to combat that as.
Much as possible then i'm just gonna add.
A few drops of the giorgio armani.
Luminous of foundation and use this to.
Kind of blend that foundation out this.
Is a very very dewy foundation and once.
Again we're trying to add the most.
Amount of moisture possible then just to.
Brighten quickly i'm gonna use my shape.
Gave concealer in the shade up light.
Stand as usual so now that we have my.
Foundation and concealer all in place.
Let's go ahead and mix all these setting.
Powders together i have an empty tub.
Right here that is ready for this.
Concoction the first part i want to add.
Is my all-time favorite which is my.
Laura mercier i have some one the top of.
The jar right here so i'm just going to.
Pour that in and then i'm just gonna.
Like a little bit of a tap just make.
Sure we have enough in there next i'm.
Going to add the two phase two peach.
Perfect setting powder whoo that is a.
Mouthful this one smells literally so.
Good and actually smells like real.
Peaches i love this one as well the only.
Thing is this is a little bit orange but.
That may help with combating like dark.
Circles especially under the eyes and in.
The beard area so this could be a good.
Addition i'm just gonna tap a little bit.
Of that powder in there next one to add.
A little bit of the beauty bakery flower.
Setting powder i've actually never tried.
This one out but i've heard amazing.
Amazing things about it so hopefully.
It'll be just as good for me next comes.
In powders that i either don't like as.
Much don't sit well on my skin or gave.
Me flashback our burst can afford a.
Little bit of the rcm a&o color powder i.
Did not like this one as much it clung.
To my skin a pretty bad oh my god.
And also did way too much brightening so.
Who next will be the tarte smooth.
Operator amazonian clay finishing powder.
Neck's is gonna be one of my all-time.
Least favorite setting powders which is.
The make up for ever ultra hd setting.
Powder listen i love makeup forever they.
Are an amazing team they have a lot of.
Amazing products i use their foundation.
In every single look but this powder is.
Just really not a good one at all i know.
It does give it very very bad flashbacks.
So i'm probably gonna have to stay away.
From this app chat tonight i'm just.
Gonna pour a little of this one in and.
Last but certainly not least we all know.
This one mmm yes we do that's enough.
So that is all seven of our setting.
Powders mixed together today i am very.
Very scared for this but i'm gonna put.
The cap back on and we're going to shake.
It up sick sick sick.
Oh shake shake shake shake your powder.
Shake your powder i need to stop so.
Looking at the powder in the jar it.
Definitely looks like a normal setting.
Powder although it does look a little.
Bit chunky i'm really not sure if that's.
Because i just shook it to mix it.
Together or if it's because the foreign.
Laws are the powder aren't mixing.
Together hopefully it's not option.
Number two but i guess we're gonna find.
Out in a short second also the color.
Looks pretty normal as well but i will.
Say it does look a little bit more.
Orange than normal the cody are some.
Powder and that two-faced peach powder.
Are both slightly orange ii peachy tone.
And hopefully that doesn't affect my.
Color shade they can be look like an.
Oompa loompa then i'm just gonna go.
Right into my beauty sponge dip right.
Into this powder and set my face that's.
Really matte whoa then of course you.
Guys might like to rock it on the nose.
Choice any water oh my god i was i think.
I like to really really pocket on the.
Nose that's always the one thing on my.
Face that gets oily the fastest this.
Feels like a normal setting powder to.
Apply but i'm not kidding when i say.
That i can literally like taste the.
Peach in my mouth i don't know if i put.
Too much of the peach powder and orvis.
Just actually that strong but regardless.
I do like that setting powder so.
Hopefully it's working in my favor.
Things were definitely getting a little.
Peachy up here in the sister studio so.
Looking close up with my skin in the.
Mirror i look very very matte there's.
Like.
Not a single trace of oh oh my god okay.
Not only do i look mad but i also feel.
Mad - holy crap.
Looking clothes everybody knows wherever.
There is a - spots right here with the.
Foundation there's a little bit worn off.
There were two little specks of setting.
Powder that wouldn't go away and i'm.
Assuming that's from the rcm a powder.
Because i remember that happening a lot.
When i use this powder and like stuck to.
My foundation and when i rubbed it away.
Now i'm left with a little bit of.
Discoloration right here so hopefully.
I'll be able to fix that when it comes.
To the most contouring later on but i.
Knew i didn't like this powder before we.
Make my face i'm just gonna go in and.
I'm going to contour and bronze my face.
Normally using my kat von d shade and.
Light palette and my benefit hoola.
Bronzer.
As always once we're onto is it of.
Course we have to bake our face so i'm.
Gonna get my blending sponge once again.
For morphe and dip into our custom m.
Powder concoction right up in here and.
We're going to turn on the oven at 350.
Degrees and bake it up the point of.
Baking is not only to prevent creases.
But it's also to brighten and add a.
Definition to makeup so with the.
Addition of the makeup forever setting.
Powder which heavily has a lot of flash.
Like and a lot of lightness and also the.
Rcm a color powder which is white.
Hopefully this will do a really really.
Great job with that and not make me look.
Disgusting.
While we are baking at 350 degrees in.
The oven i'm gonna go ahead and quickly.
Do my eyebrows off camera just to save.
Some time always some eyebrows were all.
Saved in place it has been about 20.
Minutes now so let's go ahead and wipe.
Off the bake and see how this powder.
Actually held up a hole so far so good.
Everything is still really really.
Merritt and set in place and it does.
Look a little bit brighter if you see.
Like underneath this contour but i feel.
Like the true test is definitely the.
Nose contour so let's wipe this off as.
Well obvious i mean to me it looks like.
My normal nose contour i mean i did tell.
You guys i lost my nose contouring brush.
So things in that department and general.
Have been a little bit wonky but over.
Life like it looks really really good.
It didn't cling on to my skin at all.
Which is the thing that i was very very.
Worried about everything looks really.
Nice bright side play so so far i.
Actually have no complaints.
I'm gonna give my face a light misting.
Of the scandinavian makeup finishing.
Spray just to make all the powders kind.
Of melt together because lord knows we.
Have a lot of it on right now i'm gonna.
Go ahead and do the eyes and the rest my.
Face off-camera and then i'll be right.
Back with the finished look then we'll.
Put the setting powder concoction to the.
True test and see our seven powders mix.
Together sister approved we'll have to.
Find out.
And only a few hours later this is the.
Finished that i came up with today i.
Came up with this purpley half cut.
Crease and i added a winged liner as.
Well i haven't done purple or a wing in.
Such a long time and honestly i just.
Felt like i was missing something in my.
Life i needed that purple smokiness that.
Cut winged liner and i am in love with.
On this look turned out just in case.
You're wondering i catered it using the.
Brand new morphe 15 and palette this is.
Dean bytes thinner palette from the.
Holiday collection and it is so so.
Stunning friendly randy you can use code.
James for 10% off all morphe products.
And the holiday collection i would.
Definitely recommend this so look at my.
Face in the mirror i am very very matte.
There was no question about that.
Literally dewy skin never heard of her i.
Have literally no shine anywhere on my.
Face except for obviously the place i.
Put highlighter but i feel like even my.
Highlighter today is not shining as.
Bright as normal because we layer it on.
So much powder before hand honestly my.
Face feels really really secure like i.
Said earlier it even feels matte like.
It's super super dry so honestly i feel.
Like this may last for a very very long.
Time.
But i have literally no idea we're gonna.
Put that to the test.
So i'm gonna go get change this outfit.
Is a little bit dusty if i do say so.
Myself i'm gonna put on a hat and jacket.
Because i have a birthday dinner tonight.
Over in malibu to celebrate sister.
Patrick stars birthday i love him so.
Much and we're gonna be wearing this.
Makeup all night will it flash oh oh my.
God before i leave let me take a flash.
Test right now before we actually leave.
The studio that's your test it didn't.
Flash back not even gonna lie i'm a.
Little bit shocked right now i a hundred.
And fifty percent thought we were gonna.
Have a flash like merry situation.
Tonight i was really really ready to.
Take a whole lot of snapshots how's the.
Internet go crazy once again only to use.
It for video promo for this video but.
This is not a bad thing that being said.
Even though it's not flashing back now.
And may flashbacks later on as the.
Powder wears down and we make it creases.
So like i just think before i got.
Sidetracked.
I'm gonna go quickly get dressed for the.
Event tonight and i'm gonna head out and.
I'll make sure to keep you guys posted.
All throughout the night with lots of.
Updates with my sisters and friends will.
This mixture of the seven most popular.
Setting powders stay looking amazing.
Like it does right now.
Or will it get crazy and crocky and.
Gross and cakey you'll have to find out.
Okay.
Sisters we're here at nobu i have.
Sisters carrot and crispy and sydney i'm.
Gonna ask all of you individually what.
Do you think about my skin right now.

Snatched skin let's put together a.
Little more matte than usual very matte.
Full coverage personally i love here.
With sister yoli glow the woman who.
Slays my skin all the time yoli what do.
You think about my skin right now like.
What does it look like i approve so this.
Is a powder that emphasizes texture you.

It's really emphasizing oh and you don't.
Set your makeup.
How about it'll look by the end of the.
Night you look really mad mary.
Oh it's actually pretty effects your.
Head guys i'm with the woman at the our.
Sister sorry i have a question for you.

Like it does it look good yeah but it's.
Good i mixed together every single.
Setting powder that i own and today not.
My powder    i need you to read yeah.
Foxes december 4th even ah master hobble.
Darling thank you thank you babe.
Hello sisters and back home from the.
Birthday event that was literally so.
Much fun i have reading on right now.
Because it was literally so cold outside.
I'm actually so happy that it's finally.
Getting cold in la i thought i was gonna.
Be summer all year round but wintertime.
47 p.m.
Meaning i've had this makeup on for just.
Over seven hours now which is crazy.
Because guys this looks so good i did.
Not touch up once tonight this is the.
First time since i started wearing.
Makeup and going to events that i did.
Not bring a beauty blender with me to.
Even like do some touch-ups or to powder.
My face and this still looks so bomb i.
Can't frickin believe how mad it looks -.
Like there's literally no oil at all.
Like not even on my nose and you guys.
Know so chef james's nose is usually a.
Problem place everybody that i asked out.
My skin tonight said that it looked.
Really really smooth really really good.
Really really full-coverage and really.
Really mapped i mean obviously we did.
Mixed together 7 powders to set my face.
Today i hate to say it because i.
Honestly really thought this is gonna be.
A complete joke but as you saw not a.
Single one had flashback my skin looks.
Smooth it still looks smooth it's still.
Dry it's still not guys i think i just.
Found my new favorite makeup trick this.
Is obviously the first time that i've.
Ever mixed setting powders but after.
Trying this trick out i honestly do.
Think i'm gonna make it a custom.
Concoction to use for everyday use i'll.
Probably end up mixing my laura mercier.
My too faced peach perfect and then a.
Little bit of the cody err some powder.
Because these are my all-time favorites.
I don't know about the are cma or the.
Maker for everyone because these do get.
Pretty bad flash like and this was a.
Little bit clingy and i think that i'm.
Gonna have to test out the beauty bakery.
One a little bit more as well because.
Obviously i've never actually used this.
On its own so i definitely want to see.
How it actually wears before i put it.
Into the baked concoction but you.
See convicted setting powders i think is.
A really really cool thing that i can't.
Believe it actually never thought of.
Obviously the whole point of mixing them.
Is like to get the best of all worlds of.
All the different setting powders so i.
Really really like this check and.
Definitely recommend to you guys if you.
Guys have a bunch of setting powders mix.
Them together try out your favorites and.
Definitely let me know how they wear.
Throughout the day.
Did they crack do they look matt i want.
