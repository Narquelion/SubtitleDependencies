Occasionally do i do feel like there are.
A few that do just like a little.
Something i'm just gonna copy.
Perfect literally just taking mental.
Notes of what i see in front of me well.
Okay before we even get into any other.
Questions.
I remember watching an interview with.

Did.
Okay let's talk about i really did so i.
Went to my mom's room i brought my whole.
Desktop computer.
I brought it into my mom's room and i.
Would sit it down at the perfect angle.
For there to be a toilet in the.
Background.
What so i'd be on the floor and then i'd.
Be i tried to do a vampire look.
Okay it was one of my first looks okay i.

Okay but you like you guys i wanted that.
I wanted to do it i love.
Makeup i like painting and drawing and.
Stuff okay yeah maybe the video thing.

Youtuber yeah when you started the.
Beauty stuff.
Yeah like videos like well technically.
13. oh my god there was an.
Old channel that was like comedy okay.
It's not funny.
Okay like i started this whole situation.
When i was like just about to turn 17.
Oh wow yeah well okay so one thing that.
I want to talk about.
We need to talk about the first head.
That we met yes.
Well i'm gonna start with it started at.
Coachella.
And the first time i performed at.
Coachella what yes.
But it wasn't like a full thing i showed.
Up to do.
Tia tamara with rico nasty gotta gotta.
Go.
So i did my verse and then i got to walk.
Around and do whatever yeah.
So i got there and i was you know in the.
Back whatever.
And we weren't really doing anything.
Like we were kind of just standing.
Around.
Taking pictures whatever it was cute i.
Saw you and then i was like oh my god i.
Know who that is i know that hair.
I know that face so then i was like to.
My manager.
Yes look oh my gosh she's like you want.
To say hi.
And of course me like i'm not like i'm.
Not good at that i'm not good at like.
Coming up to somebody and saying hi.
I really wish i was she was like.
Just say hi.
Like come with me and she yanked me over.
Thank god.
And then we said hi to each other i.
Remember you were like oh do you know.
The song like    i'm a cow.
Yeah and i said yes i do because it was.
It had been going really viral all the.
Time and you're like hi my name is.
Dojika nice to meet you and i was like.
Oh my god like you're so cute.
Um and you were like oh my god i love.
Your videos and it's so.
Insane to me that now a year later.
You're one of the biggest artists on the.
Planet and now i'm a fan of you.
Like that's so it's that is so cool it's.
So cool it's so cool all right so we're.
Going to move on to concealer i'm going.
To use a little bit of the.
Nars radiant creamy fun little.
Highlighted face.
One thing that i definitely want to ask.
You about if we're on the topic of.
Growing up in the social media world.
Tick tock obviously has become massive.
And.
You were already starting to like blow.
Up i feel like but there's no denying.
That you are like the queen of the tick.
Tock.
I hope so that would be nice i feel like.
Everyone's on there.
Yeah i made my mom i didn't make my take.
Talk.
I had to make a change i feel like i had.
To because one.
Haley really blew it yodeling haley for.
Those of you guys who don't know.
Yodeling haley is the girl who did that.
The dance is cute as hell say so there.
Have been 20.
Million videos made with that sound oh.
My god.
And each one of those videos also has.
Videos that's insane yeah.
The song is a bop it's really changed my.
Life.
As far as like you know i just i'll make.
A song.
And people even in the youtube comments.
Will be like oh let's hope tick tock.
Doesn't ruin this one.
So i feel like my whole career has.
Become based around it.
On tech talk yeah like that might be a.
Possibility but i mean there's no.
Denying that the app has the power to.
Make any song.
Yeah because you can do anything to a.
Song you can like do your nails and put.
The song in the background whatever you.
Know what i mean but on youtube it's.
Different.
Because you have to like get rights and.
Stuff you can't you can't use any music.
Yeah you can't use it.
Just i think it's so stupid i'm tired of.
That like royalty free.
Like what is the music oh how's it go.
The awkward sound that little like ding.
Ding ding ding like when she was like.
Awkward oh.
My god i really do appreciate tick-tock.
And i mean even like the dumb tick tocks.
I make.
Double jointed    be like.
Girl you need to stop it.
Just stop at first honestly like i would.
Watch tick tock cringe compilations.
Sure before i got into tic tac i'd watch.
The cringe comps i'd be like oh my god.
I'm not part of this.
And then i started watching the ones.
That aren't cringe ones and i'm like oh.
This is literally.
Vine yeah i was like all right fine i.
Guess there's some funny people on tick.
Tock and you know what.
Almost everybody on tik tok is funny.
It's such a funny place.
I grabbed a banana powder speaking of.
Tick tock making songs huge.
My i have to tell you favorite song.
Right now is    talk.
It's literally one of them it is so.
Catchy it's not even funny i was working.
With the city girls because they're just.
The coolest.
Super easy super cute they're so cute.
They are.
Yeah they're like characters they're.
Really really cute they're really chill.
And yeah we just had a blast i i feel.
Like you could tell that from just like.
The video and the vibes it's such a good.
Song.
All we really wanted to do was just.
Twerk in the dark yeah.
I love that i want to know well speaking.
Of collaborations who is like your dream.
Collaborator on the song you stay.
Pharrell all the time i still feel that.
Way.
I want to work with everybody yeah i.
Feel that i want to work with like.
Everybody like i don't know who my.
Number one really is other than pharaoh.
We actually seriously off camera listen.
To the    song at least 20 times a.
Day oh my god.
When they sent that to me i was like oh.
My god this hook because when she's like.
Spanish so it makes you feel so.
It's so catchy but we didn't know she.
Was saying french we thought it was.
English.
Music.
He was like speak for yourself ass.
Currently just contouring.
Your nose.
Music.
I feel like you're the king of nose.
Contour.
It's literally sorry about this angle.
But i literally.
It's like my favorite stuff with any.
Makeup routine you got to do a whole hop.
Skip and a jump and a cartwheel and.
All types of stuff to get them when i do.
My makeup don't judge me.
Judge me free i do it on the floor but.
If you walk into my house.
It's like there is just makeup all over.
The floor i've seen that whenever you.
Facetime me yeah i haven't said anything.
About it because it's not my place to.
Judge.
I just have like a long mirror that just.
Leans up against a wall and.
I sit on the floor and the makeup gets.
Spread out so i.
End up being like 20 feet away from the.
Mirror and i have to like sleep all my.
Makeup into the mirror and then.
Sit in the pile of makeup you really do.
Do your makeup often huh.
Yeah when i don't need to people where.
Are you going people ask me that i'm.
Like um instagram screens go what you.
Mean.
I'm going to sleep these are pajama.
Lashes i've seen you do your makeup.
Before on instagram live huh.
Your instagram lives are something else.
Before we even get into really that i.
Feel like one of the reasons why i.
Really.
Like just like you in general is.
Obviously your music is good but like.
You have.
Such a fun personality like if you don't.
Take anything too seriously like you.
Always just trying to have a good time.
And like.
If there's any place where i feel like.
That shows i just always think back to.
Your one instagram live where you.
Started reading your song lyrics with.
Chain mail and medieval music in the.
Background magician with the titties.
Told him pick a copy knowing just when.
I'm on.
I love doing stuff like that why it's.
Just like honestly.
Quarantine will do that to you i don't.
Know i just felt inspired.
So that's yeah that's what came out of.
That hmm.
Okay i feel like we should do brows now.
While we let this sit in place for a.
Brief moment yes.
Ooh i like to do my own brows usually oh.
But she's a.
She's an mua now i'd like to see you try.
To do the spark brow on me.
Like that was like a that was like a.
Threat almost a little bit.
Excuse me but like i kind of want to see.
You do it because i feel like you would.
Kill that.
I would it's my job let me pull up a.
Reference folder so i can make sure that.
These are really accurate and up to your.
Standards because clearly they're high.
Okay well one other question that i want.
To ask you kind of going back to a.
Little bit what we were talking about.
Earlier.
Um your first i feel like was move like.
Your first like viral.
That was the first thing that ever.
Really popped off yeah i remember that's.
Why i first heard about you you wrote.
That i think in like 12 hours and it was.
Inspired by a shirt that you're wearing.
It was a satire it was a joke yeah like.
It was really like i was on live.
And everybody was giving me their input.
I had just started i just set up.
We didn't have anything ready to like we.
Didn't have any ideas.
Prior like i was just like what do i do.
Today and i'm wearing cow print and my.
Hair literally has little horns.
Yeah and i'm sitting there and i'm like.
I'm not about to write about a boy and i.
Just start singing like    i'm a cow.
I'm a cow right i.
Made that song in the middle of my.
Career really.
Right i had been making music maybe six.
Years before.
Yes for like for six years straight i.
Was putting stuff out nobody.
Really got into it and i guess it was.
One of those moments because it's.
Something that i would do.
I would make like goofy stuff right it.
Was one of the moments where i was like.
I'm gonna make a video to this and i.
Didn't have a lot of videos.
And i think people really appreciate.
Videos yeah let me put on this.
Just don't talk for one second you know.
What does talking chris    there's.
Talks.
Oh english spanish how does your.
Songwriting process work and like how do.
You go from writing joke songs like that.
So then all of a sudden writing number.
One hits.
Um well so i had been already making.
Serious music but i i really just like.
Like to make music i can make like an.
If you give me seven days i can make.
Seven songs.
Really yeah i mean like i can sit there.
And do it all you know.
All week if i don't have anything to do.
But i just i like to do it so much that.
It's like.
It's gonna happen regardless you know.
Like some people think.
Maybe i'm like i don't really take music.
Seriously but i.
Kind of do yeah like i kind of to an.
Extent like i just like to do that i.
Mean.
I don't really because i could play.
Video games all day but that.
You know if i'm not doing that i'm you.
Are a gamer huh yes yes.
Okay well that is one brow looking.
Fabulous i completed this challenge and.

So good so i'm gonna give you a little.
Bit of a.
Spritzes setting spray which i could not.
Locate just to add some hydration back.
Into the skin because we had a lot of.
Powder obviously.
Okay so i feel like when you do makeup.
Stuff especially like whether it's on.
Instagram live or whether it's you.
Facetiming me at three in the morning.
I feel like you always try to do new eye.
Locks which i really like.
Yes i want to work with color and it's.
Really hard i feel like i get scared.
Because i know that.
Once i put that shade down it's not.
Coming off so i get scared of that.
That's why i don't color a lot oh and i.
Use this palette.
I use that palette and i use that one.
Pink i'm first going to start by.
Grabbing.
Oh my god what is this color i'm just.
Going to start by grabbing it.
