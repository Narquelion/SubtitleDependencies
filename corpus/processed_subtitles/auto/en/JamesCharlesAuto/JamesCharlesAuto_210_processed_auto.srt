Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel oh my.
God you guys i am so beyond excited to.
Be sitting down in filming today's a.
Brand new video i think it has been.
Weeks since they actually filmed oh my.
God so many things have been going on i.
Literally just got off the plane from.
London.
Super super late last night i am so.
Beyond jet-lagged before i even jump in.
First of all i want to say thank you.
It's so so so much to all of my uk.
London and birmingham sisters that i met.
At the begin greet last weekend it was.
Actually my first time ever in the uk.
Which is so crazy i wanted to go for so.
Long but maganda.
I had such an amazing and kind of looks.
Pretty across the con and getting the.
Chance to open the first ever more.
Feaster in birmingham it is now.
Confirmed that over 10,000 sisters.
Showed up to the mall meet in this.
Moment biggest meets of all time and.
It's tuesday night i never forget the.
Pun was unreal and other lots of hemming.
Home is actually insane the city may or.
May not have temporarily shut down for a.
Few hours.
Oopsies it was such a world welcomed by.
All the murphy staff members who were.
All wearing my palette on the eyes such.
Beautiful looks and speaking of.
Beautiful looks i've ever been more shut.
By a meet and greet card in my entire.
Life because so many of the sisters.
There had the most beautiful eye makeup.
Looks i have ever ever seen and they're.
All so beyond nice and for the uk media.
But regardless it was an incredible.
Experience that i will truly never.
Forget and i'm definitely looking.
Forward to going back very very soon but.
We are now home back in la for his warm.
And cozy and it is time to get work done.
And that brings us to today's a brand.
New video.
While i was over in the uk between.
London and la there was an 8 hour time.
Difference and i usually can pass out.
Literally just about anywhere but for.
Some reason i was having really really.
Bad at sleep issues while i was there so.
I found myself strolling through.
Instagram a lot and i discovered that.
There is a brand new trend going on here.
In the beauty community called the bratz.
Challenge basically there are super cool.
Artists out there with instagram.
Accounts that are literally dedicated to.
Taking dolls such as barbies or bratz.
Dolls and giving them full instagram.
Body makeovers full hair color changes.
Stylings really cute outfits and of.
Course makeup as well and apparently the.
Beauty community has discovered these.
Accounts because there's a.
Really cool trying going on right now.
We're makeup artists are literally.
Becoming bratz dolls i remember watching.
The literal queen of transformations.
Promise fan did this a few years ago now.
And i've seen so many incredible makeup.
Artists that i follow on instagram do.
This as well.
So definitely go check out their work a.
Proper credit for this video it goes to.
Them but since i just got home from.
Traveling and i'm not gonna text me with.
Makeup in a very very long time i.
Thought i'd be so much fun to try out.
This challenge for myself to use a whole.
Lot of makeup my palate a wig and outfit.
To turn myself into a bratz doll.
Music.
All right sisters this is going to be.
Quite the transformation so i just want.
To go ahead and get right into the video.
Well i was traveling i came across and.
Stalked so many of these different doll.
Accounts kind of figure out what's look.
I wanted to recreate there were so many.
Of them and i think it's so cool that.
This actually can art form that people.
Are doing right now somebody even said.
One of me that i found out oh my god.
Shout out to hacks tianna by that i'm.
Gonna link his video in the description.
Box down below.
He literally turned a barbie into my.
Jock which i thought was so cool but.
After going through and finding a bunch.
Of different ones i came across a.
Bisping sure posted by monster lol oh my.
God look at her she is literally so.
Beyond chic we have like a pink acrylic.
Going on a utility best with chains.
Super long blonde hair slicked back.
Fishnets thigh highs that of course a.
Cute little for a backpack i think this.
Bra stall is literally like the.
Sportswear a female version of me and.
I'm so excited to become her today i'm.
First gonna start by putting a wig cap.
On at first all because my hair is.
Looking at literally disgusting i'm.
Gonna make my head look like the ag that.
Broke the answer i'm like record if i.
Have a kind of a plain base to work on.
So the first of the transformation is.
Going to be to glue down at my eyebrows.
Obviously i have very thick and dark.
Bushy brows whereas this bra still has.
Nice and lifted.
Thin blonde eyebrows so i'm gonna grab.
My elmer's a washable school glue stick.
And just go right in i've done a few.
Different tutorials on carving my brows.
Before oh still they should link them.
Right up here but i'm just gonna speed.
Through this and we'll go on to the next.
Step.
Music.
All right so we've made it to this.
Lovely stop right here at the browser.
Laid down and ready to be covered and.
Normally next i'll go into the.
Foundation which i definitely it's still.
Not going to but you guys know i.
Definitely - laid out a kind of base.
First that we're not going to be doing.
Today because the fact that this eye.
Look is so interpreted it's gonna be a.
Lot of like kind of art and fine details.
I don't want to laid out a full base and.
Then god forbid i mess up and have to.
Wipe it all off so i'm just gonna kind.
Of focus the foundation in this area and.
Then kind of build up the rest later.
I've never really done this before but.
Hopefully it works out regardless i'm.
Gonna use the krylon tv paint stick in.
The shade and be and cover everything.
Right up there taking morphia beauty.
Sponge and blend this right now it no no.
Actually i'll use the fenty beauty.
Sponge tv that blends it so well no.
Matter how many times i do drag or i'll.
Cover this is always so horrifying to me.
Okay so well my foundation is still i'm.
Gonna go in with an angled brush and the.
Anasazi a dip brow pomade in the shade.
Taupe because obviously you want to do a.
Blonde brown today i'll do this my.
Foundation is still wet so just in case.
I mess up i can easily fix it before.
It's all set with powder so i'm just.
Gonna go right in and i'm just going to.
Start sketching at this brown oh i'm.
Gonna start the bottom line of the brow.
In the same place as i normally would.
But we're obviously gonna make this a.
Lot more arched than normal and i'm.
Keeping the photo right next to me for.
Reference and then if i look forward.
Right about at the edge of my people i'm.
Gonna start turning that brow kind of a.
Little bit more down if you guys have.
Seen my drawing videos before even.
Honestly like my regular makeup - and.
You definitely know that i like to have.
My brow tail out really really far and.
Make this kind of like a super super.
Straight but in this photo she does have.
A little bit of a shorter tail so i'm.
Definitely try to emulate that as close.
As possible and then it's gonna sketch.
In the other end of the tail i really.
Really like using the anasazi at deborah.
For this stuff just because like i said.
It is a cream product so if i mess up i.
Can really easily wipe it away and fix.
It but it's also a really really.
Buildable product so i could either use.
A little bit of it and get kind of a.
Lighter coverage like i'm going to do in.
The inner portion or a packet on for.
That full coverage kind of instagram.
Prowl 2016 james wouldn't really.
Recommend for that but it is possible if.
You want to do that okay so she just.
Fully hosted very very like straight all.
The way through once we have the shape.
All outlined i'm gonna grab the shade of.
Blonde of dipbrow which i definitely.
Should have used to out what i just.
Couldn't find it and now i did um and.
Also the shade albert as well it kind of.
Mixed them a little bit together just.
Because the brown so does definitely.
Have like strawberry blonde type of hair.
And coincidentally so is the week that i.
Have for later on it so i just so make.
Sure everything matches its going to.
Lightly feather that color in there okay.
I'm gonna clear this table concealer in.
A second but this is looking pretty good.
So far so i'm gonna try my best to.
Mirror this on the other side they are.
Not even okay let me just conceal this.
Before i go crazy and then we'll worry.
About reshaping okay i don't go to take.
Shave tape and this is in the shade fair.
Beige just like a little bit of a.
Lighter under brown moment gonna blend.
This up using a mac 242 brush now that.
That is all looking and really really.
Good and i definitely do not want to.
Change out i'm gonna grab some.
Translucent powder once again in a.
Powder puff and i'm going to lock this.
In place now that the brows are all set.
And not going anywhere.
Thank god we get to move on to the fun.
Part which is going to be the eyes now.
This is obviously going to be a lot so.
Before i actually go in and put anything.
On i do want to go ahead and try to.
Sketch this out just my face kind of.
Lightly just we get kind of like a.
General idea of where this is gonna go.
So i don't look really really stupid.
Wiping it off later on i'm just gonna.
Grab a regular anasazi eyebrow pencil.
And i'm going to start doing this okay.
So i'm debating if i want to do like the.
Anime eye where people actually draw in.
The pupil on the lower lash line or just.
Expand the white i probably should draw.
On the eye i'm gonna continue my upper.
Lash line down to right about there just.
Imagining like the liner and then it's.
Gonna come to about here like i said i'm.
Just like lightly sketching this into.
Definitely does it have to be perfect.
I'm obviously going to cover this all up.
But i just want to kind of get a rough.
Idea okay.
The winged liner will be will come up to.
Here okay and then winged liner going up.
There we go okay so when later we'll be.
Like right here yeah okay not bad so far.
That i need to put in her like actually.
Defined crease which looks like it's.
About i don't know i shouldn't put the.
Crease in my actual crease no no no no.
No that'll ruin the illusion so i'm.
Gonna draw the crease higher than my.
Regular crease but we're gonna actually.
Like draw a black line in there and make.
It look like it's a new crease does that.
Make sense.
That's it that's the shape right there.
So this is the shape of one on kind of.
All mapped out obviously we're going to.
Add a shadow and like always i'm gonna.
Do one eye at a time but just make sure.
Everything looks kind of symmetrical in.
The end i'm gonna go ahead and knock.
This one out quickly and then move on to.
The eye shadow so give me once again i.
Think i want to start off with the i set.
Off first and then do the outlines later.
Hopefully that doesn't mess me up but.
I'm gonna grab of course the james house.
X morphe palette and i'm gonna dip into.
The shade at boutique and use this and.
Layer that's all over the lid gonna lay.
Down some mac paint pot in the shade of.
Painterly on the lid then bringing this.
All the way down to my nose area as well.
Then is packing on a boutique with an m1.
To floor brush this is literally the.
Perfect color for this look i'm.
Literally just filling in this entire.
Area.
This is definitely gonna be one of those.
Looks that looks so wrong until it gets.
Right you guys have no idea how excited.
I was to be doing this challenge today.
Oh my god i don't look like a.
Before on my channel but i used to play.
It with a black and barbie dolls.
Religiously as a little boy i don't they.
Actually make it anymore but i used to.
Have this brought styling head thing.
That was literally just a gigantic a.
Broad stalk with like a long hair they.
Literally just sit there and play with.
It and do its hair all day long and.
Different braids and updos and styles i.
Remember one time actually drawing on.
The barbie head with pencils too and.
Getting screamed at by my mom who was so.
Mad that i mess up her poor face but in.
My five-year-old had a house making her.
Beautiful but i just think it's so funny.
That literally brought stalls is how i.
Actually learned how to do hair and a.
Later on in life i actually started.
Doing hair for girls for prom and ball.
And then my love for hair send it to me.
A love for makeup so like in a really.
Weird way without bratz dolls i might.
Not even be doing this job today.
It's so cool helpful circle that is.
Right now i'm using lob down an m4 3 3.
By the way to buff out that edge next.
We're going to shade it you're kidding.
On an m4 3 3 and just pop this on.
Just to kind of lighten it up a little.
Bit i noticed in the original picture.
I brought sell definitely had a little.
Bit more of a light lit compared to her.
Crease and i forgot to do that so oops.
Okay so now i want to do her eye liner.
I'm gonna grab the next liquid liner in.
Black and i'm going to use this to start.
Sketching out keep in mind we obviously.
Have this gets going too so i'm actually.
Not gonna start my eyeliner at the.
Normal place we're gonna pull that from.
The outer edge and pull it back and then.
We're gonna sketch it in and fill in the.
Lines he's gonna look really stupid at.
First but just have patience this.
Eyeliner line needs to come down here so.
Now i have to draw like the little d.
Like crease oh god here we go okay so.
This is going like here this is so hard.
Holy crap.
Now for the bottom i'm gonna start by.
Grabbing the jeffrey's our liquid.
Lipstick in the shade a drug lord this.
Is a really great white kind of product.
We're gonna use and i'm gonna just.
Basically fill my eyeball and looking.
Good so far and i'm also gonna put this.
In my waterline as well this is so.
Creepy looking oh okay i'm just gonna.
Have a little bit of a flashback from of.
Course dj halls palette i'm just the.
Flat packing brush and set that right in.
Place now i'm gonna grab the black liner.
Once again we're gonna outline the.
Bottom of the eye.
Who's gonna follow that eyeliner oh my.
God okay it's starting to come together.
Great okay i'm gonna add more cranberry.
On eyeshadow and lashes of course later.
On but i'm going to do that after the.
Base um so now i think i have to draw in.
The eyeball okay so this is where things.
Get tricky so now we have to do like the.
Whole illusion part which is basically.
Making my eyes look like they are huge.
We're already running into one issue of.
This is that when you do this you're.
Supposed to wear a circle lenses which.
Are basically just really really large.
Contacts i can't wear those because they.
Wasn't actually able to find any that.
Come in prescription and a lot of.
Prescription i can't see anything so.
This barbie would have looked botched um.
Therefore we're just gonna have to make.
It work i'm going to photoshop the.
Picture that i post on instagram heads.
Up as if i don't photoshop every other.
Picture anyway we're gonna have to do.
Your best to visualize it but regardless.
We're drawing on another eyeball to make.
It look like my eyes are bigger when i.
Do this i'm going to look forward i also.
Have very long lower eyelashes which is.
Going to make this illusion even more.
Difficult because they're going to get.
In the way i have to paint them as well.
So.
Lord help me great house looks good now.
I'm going to fill this in with a white.
Brown color to match my contacts gonna.
30 brush and dip into the.
Chain to punch me in the palate then i'm.
Gonna have a little bit of tea and use.
This to shade the what is this this is.
The iris the iris okay now i have to.
Draw in the new people okay.
Now i just need a white dot alright and.
Finally last up i'm just gonna grab a.
Tiny little pencil brush this is the e30.
7 and the tiniest tiniest tiniest.
Tiniest little bit of spooky and used on.
The back of my hand just rub on any.
Excess and then use this too lightly.
Shade all right sisters so i know this.
Absolutely looks crazy right now.
But this is pretty much the illusion all.
Complete all we have left is like the.
Lashes and the lower lash line but i.
Don't want to do this until later on.
Once i have my face and foundation.
Already on so i'm just gonna crack for a.
Second or probably rather a good hour or.
So and try my absolute best to mirror.
This eye over to this side i feel like.
Symmetry is very very important when it.
Comes to bratz dolls and really just.
Recreating all dolls so wish me luck and.
I'll be right back oh my god you guys.
Look at this.
We're still missing the watch then the.
Lower lashline shadow but it's.
Definitely trying to come together oh my.
God i'm so excited.
I just never honestly like pulling this.
Off at least kind of so now just going.
To do the rest of everything else so i'm.
Gonna grab my krylon tv paint stick once.
Again and now we're just gonna lay down.
The kind of base all over and i saved.
This for later just because obviously we.
Have a new set of eyes now so i had to.
Kind of put that around back okay and i.
Was gonna buff this in once again this.
Is so this is also kind of scary low-key.
Oh my god okay so now we're gonna grab.
Once again of the white that we use to.
Highlight.
Earlier and i'm gonna use this to add in.
Some highlights to the face i'm gonna.
Keep this very centered in like the.
Middle of the face i'm just having my.
Face exactly like normal except just a.
Little bit lower underneath.
Eyes right up along that lash line this.
Is so crazy now i'm going to upon this.
Out okay i set this now more powder this.
I keep looking in the monitor and.
Getting shocked this is so crazy.
Oh my gosh now that the face is all set.
We were looking a little bit flat and i.
Want to add in some dimension now.
Looking at this photo the brazo doesn't.
Really have that much contour or.
Highlight going on it's mostly just a.
Little bit of a blush but that is.
Because it is a doll with a perfect face.
Shape um i don't really have that so.
Therefore i'm going to contour a little.
Bit more to kind of round everything out.
But i'm gonna try to keep it a little.
Bit more subtle then we'll see how that.
Actually works just cover my anasazi out.
Contour kit gonna kind of hit this a.
Little bit more rounded than normal kind.
Of pulling this in a little bit lower.
Still going to contour my jawline so it.
Looks like i got liposuction for a real.
One.
Just because bratz dolls definitely do.
Have a very very distinctive facial.
Shape and i'm just going to try to round.
Out my forehead as much as possible.
Same thing with the nose contour.
Definitely not a lot going on but then.
Again doll nose is definitely nowhere.
Near this baby right here so we're gonna.
Try our best to contour definitely try.
To emphasize like the ball on the end of.
The nose i want to make the sides look.
Really tiny so i'm gonna put this the.
Lines here and then blend them up into.
The eyeshadow okay so this is probably.
Like the best we're gonna get the nose.
Contour i already work miracles with my.
Regular boy and makeup doing a whole lot.
Of nose country and a whole lot of face.
Tuned there's no saving this so we're.
Just gonna have to go with it and hope.
For the best but next is blush so i'm.
Gonna grab the kylie blush in the shade.
Of pink.
Power this one is so cute from her new.
Collection and the morphe of 4 brush i.
Normally don't go over like more pinky.
Tone blushes you guys know i love a good.
Quarrel on that but i think this is.
Going to match the look so well open it.
Does and we thought this is so pretty.
And once again being very very rounded.
With this shape kind of pulling it down.
And inwards now that i had that all in.
Place i'm gonna go ahead and bake my.
Face like normal but instead of my.
Irregular powder i'm going to use the.
Been night super white powder now this.
Stuff is very very intense but we.
Definitely are going for a very high.
Contrast type of look today so i'm just.
Going to grab once again at my same at.
Beauty wonderin tip it right in.
I'm gonna press that powder right up.
Against the sides of this nose and this.
Might help a little bit with the contour.
Illusion well we know we're crossing our.
Fingers and well that's it sir let's go.
Ahead and work on the lower lash line.
I'm gonna grab a tiny little buffing.
Brush and dipping into a boutique just.
Like before we're going to go in and.
We're going to blend that right along.
The lower edge of the liner and i'm.
Gonna keep this very very tight to that.
Line as well because the brachfeld.
Definitely does not blend hers down very.
Far i'm gonna use an even tiny little.
Buffing brush dip into the littlest bit.
Of spooky and use that to blend together.
Deep black liner and boutique then it's.
Never gonna have about four or five six.
My tiny little custom blending brush and.
Dipping into a little bit of love that.
It's going to blend out that outer edge.
I'm just realizing now too for the.
Crease that i put in i just drew a line.
But in a real eye crease obviously.
There's like a tiny little bit of shadow.
Can't leave out any details we want this.
Look as realistic as possible i'm just.
Gonna go into a 506 person took it to a.
Little bit more spooky time off the.
Excess because i want this to be a very.
Very tiny detail but i'm just gonna go.
Over that crease line and just blend.
Very very lightly as if there is a.
Shadow because i'm a fold further laughs.
I'm gonna glue on my lash it to the top.
In a quick second but for the bronze.
Bottom lashes she actually has it three.
Tiny little spikes so i'm gonna draw.
Those in using a liquid eyeliner this.
One is from a tom ford that looks so bad.
I'm not really sure what i can do about.
That okay if i clean up with consider it.
Right now without this is so hard.
Oh no okay that's better than nothing.
Now to make them even on the other side.
Oh i didn't know where i want to put the.
Lashes on my actual eyelids because i'm.
01.
These are from the crime shop i love.
Them they're super super just like big.
These are what i usually use for drawing.
Because of the fact we put the white.
Here and the eyeliner starts here.
Technically the outer edge of my eyelash.
Should be like here which is where i.
Should glue the lash but i feel like.
This wrong side because if i feel like.
My eyeliner is there it just like will.
Look really.
What the hot why does it look at that.
Okay so to fix that last night it took a.
Little bit of hairspray this is the got.
To be glue that i always used to really.
Lock my normal hair in place i just.
Sprayed out the lash and then pinch them.
Together.
Look a little bit more like spidery doll.
Like hopefully this will look a little.
Bit better.
I don't really know so we're gonna.
Figure out together i also don't really.
Know where i'm gonna put this lash kind.
Of put the inner corner that looks good.
Well that worked way better than.
Anticipated oh my god well i'm so sated.
Okay great oh these look like freakin a.
Smile from em first.
Alright you guys this is lily look at.
You so good and also so creepy at the.
Same time i've ready to move on to the.
Next step those of the eyes literally.
All complete like i said the lashes.
Definitely pulled it all together oh i.
Can't believe i actually pulled this off.
Oh my god okay i'm gonna go ahead and.
Wipe off this baby it's been sitting.
Because it's been really sitting there.
For quite a while now and i don't want.
To get crusted for holly we're gonna.
Keep it relatively subtle and going with.
A little bit of a face for my palate.
Actually really use regular einstein.
Once again keeping that very rounded.
Shape going here gonna bring a little.
Bit of that down the nose as well as.
Always also it might distract a little.
Bit for everything else going on sounds.
Good oh nice then all we get to do the.
Fun part which is of course going to be.
The ellipse at the last and final stop.
This is going to be a really good and.
Fresh because we get to over line the.
Crap out of them i'm gonna try my best.
Model of this video so their lips come.
Up my mouth is very very very wide and.
Large if you haven't noticed over the.
Course last few years quite a lot comes.
Out of it both good and bad but a big.
Mouth is a problem when you have a tiny.
Little barbie mouth away the very large.
Lip so i'm just gonna have to pose like.
Music.
Now i'm going to use the jeffree star.
Cosmetics liquid lipstick in the shade.
Of a birthday suit to fill this end and.
Then grabbing a little bit of it drug.
Lord and then just like i did with that.
Tiny little white line and the pupil of.
The eye i'm just gonna use the same.
Exact method to add on little highlights.
To literally six hours later i think.
That is the makeup portion of this look.
All complete i'm obsessed with how this.
Turned out i was so scared at first i.
Did not know if this was going to turn.
Out even remotely okay this is probably.
One of the hardest looks i've ever done.
But i am so credibly proud of this but.
But look it's not over yet because we.
Still have a lot of transforming left.
Still to do as you can tell so i'm gonna.
Go off camera quickly put on my wigs at.
Some clips in my outfit and i'll be.
Right back to show you the finished.
Transformation.
Music.
