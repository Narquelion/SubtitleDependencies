Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel for.
Today's that i have a super super fun.
Makeup challenge plan for a lovely video.
I got ready in the complete pitch-black.
Darkness which was so intense.
The results were spooky diddley's if you.
Guys have not checked out last week's.
Video be sure to click right up here and.
Go check it out but i had so much fun.
Doing and i really don't do makeup.
Challenges that often so i wanted to do.
Another one today mostly because i'm.
Running out of video ideas but i thought.
It'd be very very fun and this is one.
Challenge you guys have been requesting.
For so long it is always one of the top.
Comments on my videos this challenge.
Breaks all laws of makeup and that is.
Doing my makeup backwards all makeup.
Lovers both professional artists and.
Average makeup wears how about we like.
To call a makeup routine i personally.
Like to start off with my face then.
Eyebrows and eyes then lashes that lips.
Then finishing touches that i don't like.
To do a different routine some people.
Start with their eyebrows some people.
Start with their eyes don't even ask me.
How they do that but obviously the end.
Goal no matter where you start is to.
Look beautiful and confident for today's.
Video i'm gonna only make up knowledge.
Upside down and do a makeup routine.
Backwards starting with settings for it.
And then finishing off with foundation.
Which is normally my first thing i think.
You guys get the point at this point.
This should be intense i don't know who.
The originator heir so i don't know who.
To give credit to but i know both dante.
And michael think i've done an please go.
Check out the videos they're absolutely.
Amazing content creators i love them.
Both but everyone who has done this has.
Been using it through normal makeup.
Products in the opposite order for me.
I'm gonna do everything in the opposite.
Order but i did switch out a few.
Products that i knew would really really.
Mess everything up because i do want to.
Try to make this the best-looking result.
Possible even while still doing it.
Backwards you guys know what i mean.
Long story short i am so excited for.
This so without further ado if you'd.
Like to see my makeup routine completely.
Backwards.
Let's get started.
Music.
Alright sister so i'm starting all this.
Up today by going in with my morphia.
Prep and set settings right and i'm just.
Going to mist my entire face as a base.
To this makeup obviously this would.
Normally be my last step but since is.
The prep and sat hopefully this will.
Still work if you know what i'm saying.
Second to last didn't wake up or two you.
Guys know i usually finished off my.
Looks with a liquid lipstick for today's.
Video i'm gonna use the anastacio liquid.
Lipstick in the shade archon i really.
Really love the shade and i think it'll.
Match really really well with the look.
That i have planned fingers crossed that.
The eyes go out certainly we have no.
Idea what it's gonna look like i am a.
Little bit worried about this though.
Because while i love the anasazi look of.
Lipsticks and all of their colors they.
Are a little bit drying so hopefully.
Throughout this entire video and throw.
Out the talking they don't get like.
Crusted sahara desert status at the end.
We'll see this looks so strange hello.
Before lifts i'm usually finishing off.
My eyes with lashes and mascara normally.
Likes to do a lashes and then blend them.
Together with the mascara because i.
Personally have a really really hard.
Time at putting on lashes but for.
Today's video we have to do mascara.
First about masha so lord help me in.
This situation we might have a very very.
Gia gunn wonky law situation but for.
Today's video i'm gonna be using the.
Benefit badgal bang mascara this is.
Their brand new a 36 hour of the.
Luminizing mascara i just got back for.
An amazing trip at oman gearing with.
Benefit cosmetics if you don't follow me.
On stop you definitely should i posted.
Everything over there was so much fun.
But we were celebrating the launch of.
This mascara and it is literally so so.
Is so so good if you guys have not yet.
Checked out this baby you definitely.
Have to do you see how pretty my alice.
Just look right now hello benefit girl.
You snapped.
So next obviously comes lashes and for.
Today's video of course i'm going to use.
My lily lashes and miami's these are my.
All-time favorite lashes and i also just.
Recently found out you can use ko james.
For 10% off of these i know some of you.
Guys have used it before but i didn't.
Even know that existed so hey if you.
Ever want to check out my all-time.
Favorite lashes coat james gets the.
Money off you're welcome okay second.
Time's the charm.
She's on there i think the one thing.
That's really good about this challenge.
Is that my eyeliner is got to come after.
My lashes so i get to hide all the.
Mistakes that i just made woo before.
Doing my lashes i normally line my.
Waterline.
I'm gonna do that using the pretty.
Vulgar new two liner and then comes.
Lowered lashline shadow and for today's.
Look i'm gonna be using the chocolate.
Hell are some apollo i guess we have to.
Go from darkest to lightest which is not.
What i normally like to do but we're.
Gonna have to make it work i'm first.
08 this is just a.
Tiny little blending brush and grab this.
Dark brown shade right in here and buff.
This right up against the lash line i am.
Of course planning a wing too so i'm.
Just gonna pull this out slightly in the.
Outer corner to make sure that that's.
Blended together and there's no like.
Really awkward divide i'm next in to.
Grab my makeup shock t61 brush and dip.
Into this ready shade right here and use.
That to buff out the brown i'm placing.
That right below i'm making sure that.
There's no harsh edges really using that.
To diffuse out the brown because we did.
Not want it to look like we just got.
Punched in the eye.
But of course leaving room because we.
Don't wanna pull it too far down finally.
I'm gonna go over smith 247 brush and.
Dip into this bright orange and this.
Kind of mac and cheese shade right here.
Mixed together and then just buff that.
Out so far actually not that bad moving.
On to my upper lid at my last of my eye.
Looks is always eyeliner if i'm wearing.
It and for today's look yes it does.
Include eyeliner so i'm gonna turn up.
The tom ford island our pen and attempt.
To sketch out a way over top of my.
Lashes oh god.
Hey did i just do it oh when it comes to.
This challenges you guys might like to.
Go big or go home.
And normally next to be eyeshadow but.
For this look i want to do i'm probably.
Gonna regret this.
Hey glitter cut crease so i got the bh.
Cosmetics glitters in the shades.
Sapphire and mermaid blue and also the.
Violet boss glitter adhesive normally.
Yes i would do this first then this but.
Let's be real these are never gonna.
Stick so get over it it's not that deep.
I'm just gonna ply these with the darker.
Blue in the outer corner i'm bringing.
Into the teal and hopefully we'll be.
Able to make this look really cute do.
You see this hello look at how good that.
Crease sighs i feel like we might be.
Able to make this work to start off the.
Actual cut crease i'm gonna go back to.
The light chocolate eyeshadow palette.
And my e39 brush and start off with this.
Dark brown shade once again so much of.
The lower lashline and go right above.
That crease.
Okay interesting i'm not gonna get that.
Same i'm 508 brush from before and dip.
Into that same a bright red shade and.
Blend out that line if any of you guys.
Watching they're like oh gee sisters you.
Know that this is the technique i used.
To use all the time for doing up cut.
Creases i have more recently actually.
Switching to the normal technique of.
Doing it when starting off with the.
Lightest shadow and then working way in.
And then just cutting it but i used to.
Do all my cut creases by sketching out.
The line first and then i'm blending.
Upwards so i think i may have the upper.
Hand in this but clearly it's not.
Looking too great so far so i don't know.
I'm gonna really carefully blend that.
Out clearly she needs a little bit of.
Work using the bright orange paint from.
Before.
I think i'm gonna grab that mac and.
Cheese hit from before and just go right.
Over those edges what's actually working.
My favorite here is that since they.
Don't have an eyeshadow base on if.
Anything gets too intense i can just go.
Over with my blending brush and just.
Scrub really really hard and it'll.
Actually take off some of that product.
Since it doesn't have anything to really.
Stick to okay so that is what i all.
Complete obviously may still have some.
Work to do but i'm gonna go ahead and do.
The other one off-camera in the same.
Exact order i promise and i'll be right.
Back all right now back about 30 minutes.
Later and that is the second eye all.
Complete and this should be proof that i.
Never cheat during challenges even off.
Camera because this eye is not looking.
The best.
So before eyes my makeup routine always.
Comes my eyebrows but i always fill them.
In and then use my brow gel and then.
Clean them up since this is reverse i'm.
Gonna go out at some concealer and go.
Right under this and be super super.
Careful and not to overlap the eyeshadow.
And then fill the man wish me luck.
I have to try to imagine where i'm going.
To actually fill in the eyebrow.
Music.
That looks about right maybe i'm gonna.
Grab a synthetic bullet brush this is.
The e36 and buff that out being really.
Really careful to not mess up the.
Eyeshadow that i worked so hard on okay.
Honestly that doesn't even look that bad.
But now i have no idea how we're gonna.
Fill these in without messing up i.
Really rely on that concealer afterwards.
To fill my brows today i'm going to use.
The iconic brow cushion in the shade.
Medium sister nikkietutorials introduced.
Me to this in our collab and i feel like.
I'll be able to be really precise with.
This at an angle brush since it is a.
Liquid of formula hopefully.
Music.
Okay you know what a little bit dark but.
I feel like we can work with bass okay.
That is the other bra i'll complete once.
Again not lying about this good brow a.
Brow let's move on so now that the lips.
Eyes and brows are all complete it is.
Time for the base makeup now it is so.
Weird too because a lot of people.
Actually start their base makeup with.
Eyes and brows already done but for me.
That is something that is very very new.
To me i don't do that like ever so this.
Is definitely gonna be a major major.
Challenge normally when it comes to my.
Base makeup you guys know that likes to.
Use my powder products but for today's.
Video like i said i do want to switch.
Out my products just a little bit to.
Really try my best to make this a.
Successful look so out of my basic of my.
Last step is always a highlighter so for.
Today i'm gonna use the brand new.
Married do manizer from the balm which.
Is a liquid highlight i'm gonna put this.
Right in the same places as my normal oh.
Wow that's really pretty.
Okay i'm gonna put this into normal.
Pieces as all my highlights usually go.
In the inner corners then i'm just gonna.
Take my damp beauty blender and i'm.
Going to blend it right out oh you're.
Kidding wow that's blinding though huh.
Love best whoa i definitely need to try.
To sell again in a video where i'm not.
Like completely messing up my makeup so.
Before a highly obviously comes a.
Contour and normally i use my kat von d.
Shade alam palette but like i said i'm.
Not gonna use powders because we.
Obviously have to do a foundation and.
Concealer later on and that just gets.
Really really messy so i'm lee needs my.
Benefit hoola cream contouring stick.
Instead just gonna go right in all the.
Hollows of my face a little bit on the.
Forehead tell you know reduce that.
Hairline because lord knows sister needs.
It on the jaw line to really snatch her.
Up and then also right down the bridge.
Of the nose you guys for this video i.
Definitely do not think we're gonna have.
A snatched nose and i am.
Very sad about it then once again just.
Gonna take my damp beauty blender and.
Buff that right in oh that is a little.
Orange well you're literally kidding me.
I look like i was doing my makeup.
Outside on a really sunny day and only.
Did my eyes and my brows and then fell.
Asleep and woke up like seven hours.
Later with a sunburn what is going on no.
This was so good okay say this what i.
Hadn't grabbed my iconic london a cream.
Contour kit and i'm gonna go in it with.
This shade right down here to both.
Darken up the contours but also cool.
Them down just a little bit because.
Clearly this is not what we want okay.
Yeah much better.
A little intense but we can fix this we.
Got this in the bag.
Pretend that little meltdown ever happen.
This is scary.
So before contouring highlighting and.
Blush obviously comes concealer and at.
The foundation but in between those is.
The powder and if you guys are a makeup.
Lover you know that the number one rule.
And makeup is that it's really really.
Just illegal like the police will come.
After you if you put a cream product.
Over powder it's just the formulas and.
The texture and the chemistry behind it.
Just makes them not really work together.
But that's today's challenge we have to.
Do it now i'm just gonna use a light.
Amount of my laura mercier translucent.
Setting powder mix together my too faced.
Sweet peach powder on this one oh god my.
Damp beauty blender and dip right in and.
Just apply a really really really light.
Layer to the entire face to set it in.
Place and hopefully not to disrupt the.
Foundation.
Told you there are the police mitchell.
Now so another face is all set in place.
Before that step comes concealer and of.
Course i'm using my guitar shape deep in.
The shade light neutral and i'm actually.
Kind of happy that this step is coming.
Before foundation because i think i can.
Kind of use this to my advantage to.
Really carve out my mistakes being the.
Eyebrows of course the nose contour the.
Lips and the contour so everything is.
Like ready and more clean for the.
Foundation we could pull this together.
Let's see i'm of course gonna put this.
Right in the center of my forehead for.
Highlighting okay just cut that bra off.
A little bit but you know what maybe.
It's for the better.
Music.
Well this is an interesting look to say.
The least.
Yes thank god for beauty blenders.
Because they really do fix anything.
My contour literally looks like trixie.
Mattel from rupaul's drag race i'm.
Coming for you girl my god this kids is.
Why you did not put creams or liquid.
Over powder because once that is set in.
Place whenever you put over top will not.
Blend oh no oh this needs to blend out.
Oh my lord i cannot have this contour of.
My own right now.
So my base has gone from nothing and.
Very very pimply inbred - way to orange.
Way too dark.
Now way too light and still very.
Uneven so obviously the next step and.
Last step is going to be foundation.
Normally you guys know i use the too.
Faced for other things just like my.
All-time favorite hold it girl.
Foundation it is so so so good but i.
Will say for my skin type it is a.
Hydrating foundation that does not dry.
Down and since this is the last step and.
I do not have powder to modify and save.
The day i'm gonna go with the la girl.
Pro matte new foundation in the shade.
Stand these just launched and i watch a.
Review on them and apparently these do.
Dried down never try these before so.
This could be an absolute disaster but.
Fingers crossed that this hopefully.
Finishes us up very very nicely because.
I feel like where we're at right now.
This look is not that bad.
I'm just gonna go into my same beauty.
Blender and really lightly it go right.
Over the entire face.
You guys wait a second this actually.
Kinda looks good before foundation.
Usually comes a primer but you guys know.
I stopped using it a long long time ago.
Because i've always messed up my nose.
Contour so i guess this works my.
Advantage because i think i'm done okay.
You guys looking in the mirror right now.
I am shucks out of my mind not even.
Gonna lie i picked this look today.
Because i wanted to challenge myself but.
Mostly because i thought this is gonna.
Be a major fail and would make for some.
Really comedic content listen you gotta.
