Seemed less excited and so i didn't want.
To force anything anymore but i think.
It's really important to yeah you got a.
You've got a prioritizing method i think.

Especially this year which chains videos.
Everybody's like prioritizing you know.
Taking care of your anxiety or.
Depression or whatever.

Apartment is very key i wall sides we.
Experiment with the rainbow have you.

Behind everything to look for it.
Hello it's good that for gonna contour.
Okay we're gonna blend that out really.
Good so from me i'm really driven by it.
Like challenging myself i just like.
Making people happy to like i grew up.
Getting bullied a lot by different kids.
That i've always had a very very thick.
Skin so i've always been able to kind of.
Deal with it but i know so many kids.
Can't anything i just really like how to.
My shame i'll be like a place where.
People can go just to laugh and have a.
Good time and there may be a little bit.
About me coming some of the videos and.
Just the kind of like i'm just like a.
Chill you know like.
I feel like the world is like so dark.
You've turned your insecurities into.

Able to grow because they got ya know.

Cheekbones because you have a super bomb.
One's really bad cheekbones have to use.

Thing i wish i would have landed in my.
Mouth james spitting on liza for 10.
Minutes straight.
I honestly i'm doing this collapse in.
One of those there's one of them.
Something oh grayson perfect see her if.
I could erect i've never had my makeup.
Done by anybody in the beauty community.
Which by the way you guys are amazing.
Your party was so fun oh do i get i'm.
Glad i wasn't excited that you showed up.
This foundations matching pretty good so.
Far okay so since i do my own makeup.
Literally all the time and i don't.
Really do that many collabs either i.
Have never gotten the chance to do a.
Woman of color on my youtube channel.
Before like my first was a brown girl.
Yeah so i was really excited for today.
But also really nervous too because the.
Undertones furley people of color versus.
White yeah it's very different.
No it's very tough and like i've always.
Had like a purpley hue whenever someone.
Does my makeup like i'm sad sometimes no.
Shake no shake but i've always had like.
A purple kind of like undertone but i.
Have a naturally red or yellow under.
Yeah yeah great guys today yes but yeah.
No it's hard it's hard to like nail it.
Yeah i feel really good feel really.
Buttery right.
That's good i'm really doing it like.
People color skin is so much fun because.
Literally yeah so much contrast oh yeah.
Like it's so good oh i'm like one of.
Those transformation photos they're.
Gonna twitter when you say like the.
Power of makeup oh don't trust girls and.
Makeup i am that so i'm going to now how.
Are you even set you in place james look.

Young people you ready no yeah but can i.
Show you the makeup look that i tried to.
Do for your party yeah okay so i went to.
Your instagram i also watched like a.
Tutorial to like see how to do my base.
Yeah by the way look - nothing like this.
But i dried i went to this photo and i.
Was like okay i want her exactly like.
That no i did not i love you want a face.
To it on this for me wait no there's no.
Face to none that i'm sure captain.
Natural just like you're instagramming.
Right please don't.
Yeah could we okay we can do that yeah.
You can do that on me alternate host.
Idols good luck charlie james charlie.
What are you using is that better than.
Midnight well okay so a banana powder is.
Gonna be really good for like deeper.
Skin tone so i'm not really going to use.
A more like yellow shade when it comes.
To like a setting your under eyes are.
Going over top of it but i don't really.
Have any of my collection just because i.
Come over i get pr packages i usually.
Give away all of my deeper skin tone.
Complexion products to my assistant or.
Other makeup artists that work around me.
In my industry because i'm not going to.
Get any you some of them and i'd rather.
Have them go to people that need them i.
Guess so much makeup on an everyday.
Basis and i'll never know yes i would so.
Much rather like a donate it the woman.
Shelters are give us to like morning.
Artists who i know need it or can't.
Afford it yes i'm not ever going to do.
That there's no point in sitting in my.
Closet you're incredibly generous by the.
Way why nice to give back to just like.
Your audience all the time which is so.
Like makes me so happy enough.
I'm so happy but you're also so.
Uplifting of other creators and like.
That's what i loved about your campaign.
Like those really fun oh thank you yeah.
I like made me want to become a makeup.
Artist so that i can get attacking.
Mm-hmm.
Do you want kids absolutely not no no.
Really no i feel like just your like.
Makeup looks on your children would be.
Great channel baby makeup okay so one.
Thing that i talk about my channel a lot.
Of my subscribers like hear me talk.
About at least i think so oh yeah the.
One thing that i've discussed quite a.
Lot is like the difference between.
Traditional media celebrities and.
Youtube additional media announcers and.
Huge disconnect in the space yeah.
And i feel like you're one of the very.
Few craters who's done a really great.
Job at kind of bringing their brand to.
More traditional media so when i was.
Like how do you feel about that like it.
You have like what are you planning.
For your own future and not like whoa.
See i don't plan that's my you know i.
Haven't uploaded but like i think you.
Don't like actually like know exactly.
What i'm doing i'm kind of just like.
Always just kind of like gone with the.
Flow you're honest with like traditional.
And digital i feel like there's been.
Like a nice like blurred line now like.
Ray smith is doing youtube yeah that's.
Crazy yes that's so cool the fact that.
Like a traditional celebrity is like.
Starting to you like dabble in like.
Creating and on social media and they're.
Willing to allow their life to be put.
Out there more and.
And be more vulnerable by sharing their.
Experience it's like even just like jada.
Smith i know this is doing like.
Read.table talks like that's so whole.
It's so cool it's so open and so raw and.
And it's so exciting to like see them to.
Do that like that's stepping into a.
Whole new world yeah you know i really.
Respect to those faces josh peck because.
He yeah i was like reinvented himself.
Multiple time yes so would you say.
They're like you're you definitely feel.
Like there's like a good shift happening.
In the right direction.
Oh yeah percent and i think people are.
Taking like digital media i mean social.
Media like a lot more seriously in terms.
Of it being considered like a stepping.
Stone to like a career or be consider an.
Actress or being considered a host er.
It's just exciting yeah those you.
Spinning my face no thank you ones that.
If like really fellow really good job at.
Like starting that conversation i tried.
I really wanted to blow that line.
Because like it's just another way for.
People to come up in whatever community.
They want to come up any beauty or that.
Be entertainment like it's just a way to.
Showcase your talent or whatever you.
Have to offer the world and i think it's.
Really cool that we have this.
Opportunity and we live in this.

An interview and they wanted like a.
Little side commentary you don't make.
They cut out of video so you don't even.
Get to see the whole thing but like it.
Was such an honor.
That was my like one of my teeth.
Pacific now moments yeah yeah because i.
Was chewed out online for what i was.
Wearing and how i looked and like that.
Was a big like breaking point for me.
Because i have never like handled like a.

With for me but i wish like i like.
Watched your video the other day of your.
