Can see today i'm done with some very.
Brilliant sisters special guests the.
Kitty girls yay so do you guys from.
Birth few months ago we actually got.
Together for our first video where we.
Did my best friend's expose me and that.
Was kind of like the sisters first time.
Ever actually meeting like the og.
Sisters like we've been best friends for.
A very very long time i've known.
Everyone here except for drew for almost.
More it's like almost four years now.
Yeah whoa that's so crazy all of us.
Starting a group chat together called at.
The kitty girls and we literally talk.
All day long every single day and we're.
Pretty what's together at least like.
Three to four times a week to open the.
Kathy actually live with me and tours.
Here almost every night so it's pretty.
Much a family fiesta it's honestly a.
Good first time i think one of my.
Favorite videos that i've ever filmed on.
This channel was a collab with pretty.
Much the entire vlog squad and we played.
A game called a make up relay race.
Ironically the same exact game it would.
Dis been great because we've been.
Friends for such a long time now we've.
Been through so much together our.
Friendship has been tested and i feel.
Like we've always come out on top.
Stronger than ever.
But we've never been tested as makeup.
Artists and that that's what my youtube.
Channel is all about so for today's.
Video we're going to be playing makeup.
Relay race everybody excited yeah in.
Case you guys into the first make up.
Relay race video basically how it works.
Is just like a normal relay race we have.
Our numbers 1 through 6 here and the.
Iconic wall power from last video which.
By the way if you've not yet seen it.
Click right up here and go check it out.
And everybody's going to pick a number.
Out of the hat and then that is going to.
Be the order that all the kitty girls.
Will have 5 minutes to do whatever part.
Of my makeup routine that they want the.
Whole point is that you're only as.
Strong as your weakest link.
We do have makeup artists and the screw.
So this could.
Okay i'm on the ride let's talk about.
That my booking fee is low let's talk.
About this for a second because i do.
Feel like the playfield it's like very.
Even like when it was the bomb squad.
Nobody knew anything about makeup but we.
There's some advantages we have going on.
Here like cassie oh yeah i'm a little.
Bit of aiming i'm dinosaur i've been.
Doing for ten years now.
Wow this is a passion elias who've been.
Working in for like five years.

Hands well victor we've done two videos.

Gonna have five minutes on the clock are.
You ready yeah three two one go.
You can like walk us through a process a.
Little bit two years well i need to like.
Prep the face oh wait moisturize you.
Sure but i don't know what moisturizer.
It looks like okay i have to ask you a.
Question during this process okay.
What are you using you don't know.
They're for almost four years now for.
You yeah and we've done two videos.
Together so how would you say like me as.
A youtuber but like also me as like a.
Friend has changed over the past several.
Years you as a person or just a.
Consolation child i mean i feel like we.
Always start off with a good start so.
That was always good that has never.
Changed but besides that i feel like you.
Mostly help me be a better person.
Really oh yes yeah you've taught me just.
How to act more around people if i never.
Had to deal with the whole being in.
Public i yeah.
So you definitely have taught me how to.
Be like that.
Which i'm you can ask a lot of my.
Friends i've never been the most.
Sociable person yeah so i definitely.
Have grown in that way foundation yes.
Great start with you later okay oh can i.
Say in one way that i think our.
Relationship has changed a lot yes i.
Feel like one thing that i really love.
Is that you've almost taken on like.
Almost like a fatherly role with me.
Along sided with elden too obviously.
Sure especially when it comes to like.
Relationship stuff yeah dealt with a lot.
Of problems with it even like you'll.
Talk to me outside of the crew time big.
Nodine's i don't leave.
That idea i think you should look at.
This play or do it this way like this.
Isn't smart you're gonna get yourself.
Hurt i'm like i really respect that.
Because i really value your opinion as.
Someone who's older but also like i feel.
Like it's a really good husband in the.
Relationship i agree.
I believe i've gotten really close to.
You where i treat you like i would.
Protect laura i protect you as well yeah.
Off to a pretty good start okay yeah.
Actually i'm a lot more proud of wow.
Good job okay thank you.
Sento be tuned ready for kid you girl.
Number two.
Oh c'mon number two hopefully you.
Moisturize first foundation i think okay.
The top five minutes on the clock.
I have a few questions lined up to ask.
You three two one go okay concealer even.
Ready to cassie first six years now i.
Feel like you have to yeah but i don't.
Do her makeup she just does her own.
Thing so this is what a lot of people.
May not know is that we actually work.
Together every day and live together -.
Were just kind of month alden was.
Actually working as an aerospace a.
Machinist yeah beforehand so very smart.
Organized engineering type of person.
Like going from like aerospace machinery.
To beauty guru full-time employees very.
Very different i would assume right.
Basically before i was like talking.
Clock out yeah coming to work at like.
00 in the morning and then leaving.
00 yeah so like you climbing.
Yeah running out of time we're gonna.
Bake now so now our schedules like very.
Sporadic and we travel a lot there's.
Like so much different things going on.
Compared to like what i did before.
Before is like pretty routine yeah and.
Like this is like so different i want to.
Ask what would you say is the best part.
Of working together what would you say.
Is the worst part of working together.
And you.
Be honest this is a good question for me.
As they as human resources department.
The best part is all the traveling and.
Everything yeah the i would say the.
Worst part is probably well a lot of.
Times cassie gets to come with us too.
But it's hard because we have to french.
Bulldogs that we have to leave behind.
And sometimes cassie isn't able to go.
Yeah which i would love like for all of.
Us to go well the whole group would be.
Awesome job.
Oh i want the worst part of not being.
Able to be there.
Well actually the worst part is we.
Usually have the same food every week.
Like repeated yeah so like week after.
Week it's like the same thing because.
You have like your favorite meals and.
Everything i look at california pizza.
Kitchen barbeque chicken the way we go.
Around that is when you're out we get to.
Order whatever we want.
We are always having a good time look.
Good increase i just ate by flowing so.
There might like i think all right fine.
That's all the talk i'm gonna ask you a.
Few questions about our friendship - i.
Don't want to answer those ones ready.
Three two one go okay okay this bronzer.
Brush i absolutely did learn which brush.
Is the bronzer brush because i like to.
Use.
We're gonna bronze the face a little bit.
Today you know i don't ever do face.
Makeup on my clans i just did the i am.
Leave okay.
Yeah but i'm not good at the face like.
I'm only good at with the eye okay you.
Could do i should do the eye we do a.
Little more up here your foreheads.
Looking big today mom being together.
Almost every single day what is your.
Favorite thing that we do together i.
Feel like honestly like we we like.
Brainstorming our jobs dot that is only.
Favorite things we do together.
Yeah those we both do you kind of the.
Same thing like i having youtube channel.
Too but different from yours.
Yeah but james helps me with with mine.
And i helped him with his because we.
Don't like we're not competitive at all.
Yeah there's like no over there's no.
Overlap but yeah yeah i truly feel like.
Some of my favorite most productive days.
Or when you and i to sit down together.
And like just brainstorm ideas and just.
Like bounce ideas back and forth yeah.
Agreed.
Yeah okay i mean i just going with my.
Finger okay oh wow brave i know i'm a.
Makeup artist okay.
As a fashion blogger true how do you.
Feel about my fashion i think it's good.
I think it's definitely developed like.
In a good way.
Yeah like i think when i first met you.
It was very like just like instagram boy.
Like like instagram girl or whatever but.
Now it's definitely come more.
High-fashion but i still wanna see you.
Like wear more color for sure for sure.
Like cuz you would still like very.
Street and like wears a lot of black.
Which is fine like that's what you.
Personally like but i think if you want.
To be more fashion which is introducing.
A little more color.
I know oh ira me my rates are really.
Affordable um reach dr. james's email or.
Mine do not retouch on my email and oh.
Wait bye i was gonna give you a nice hug.

All right i'm gonna ask you some.
Questions about our friendship it's up.
To so laura we've known each other for.
Probably almost four years now and when.
I first moved to la i have told sorry.
Before about how i live did you and your.
Entire family and i'm forever grateful.
For everything you guys did for me we're.
Not gonna get emotional because i have a.
Funny question to ask you no don't.
After the last four years and us living.
Together or like traveling there all.
Together going to events together what.
Is one thing about either me or like my.
Job that you'll never get used to you.
Would like the meeting great so you have.
Those were like crazy you guys it's like.
It's crazy see minimal like online and.
Stuff but like when you were actually in.
There like you can actually feel like.
The room like rumbling and like energy.
The energy it's crazy like australia.

Mall of america like it's crazy.
I remember them all i'm erica me cassie.

You and victor are the only ones out of.
The friend group that have a child thank.
God yeah elliot and you obviously know.
That i don't want kids afraid i'm.
Obviously still very young.
Do you think that i'd be a good parent.
Or a terrible parent if i want to change.
My mind you know honestly i thought you.
Would be a bad book 1 but yesterday yes.
You know sunday that we were here i.
Think you took elliot to play the piano.
Upstairs and i thought that was pretty.
Cute i think that'd be cute of you to.
Like absolutely i don't know you i.
Thought i was cute but i don't think you.
Would have one i think people would she.
Let you borrow what why don't you think.
I'd be a good parent.
Oh i just don't think your patient like.
You want everything like there oh i.
Don't mess you up though so yeah we're.
Actually pretty good if we're looking.
Okay so far.
Well now we're on to cassidy and.
Hey-zeus - psychic or smooth sailing.

Anybody can fix that it's you - so.
You're gonna have five minutes to do.
Whatever you want to pull this look.
Together.
Oh and i'm saving great moment yeah okay.
We're gonna privates on the clock you're.
Gonna be able to do whatever steps you.
Want.
From you i don't ask you a few questions.
About our friendship and life too so it.
Sounds good.
Ready yes three two one go.
Okay what do you think first i'm going.
To get rose and you already know i don't.
Do a quick route we're just gonna dig.
Into a little bit of plumbing and okay.
Just going right in yeah okay cassie the.
First thing that i want to ask you when.
I was with health and i talked about how.
Are you and him kind of live with me at.
This point literally my favorite thing.
That ever happened to me just constant.
Fun and craziness at the house what has.
Been your favorite thing that's happened.
With us living together so far and the.
Worst thing that you've seen like none.
Of it i like that i'll have to see you.
The best part honestly is because i live.
An hour but in la always over two hours.
With traffic oh wait yeah so like we're.
Always together anyway and it's just so.
Just pretty much live here at that point.
Because tape all the time and gas yeah.
And we're such a big family here that it.
Is just so enjoyable to be together.
Every single day yeah but i would say.
The worst part is literally it literally.
Comes in every single morning and wakes.
My ass up cassie i cassie cassie i come.
In every single afternoon acting and.
00.
00 p.m. if you guys don't know i'm.
Nocturnal so i stay up till literally.
Sunrise and i sleep during the day but.
Miss jamie charlie over here like a good.
Old sunrise awakening so sometimes.
They'll come in and like cuddle in bed.
And then sometime cassie.
Rise and shine.
So that is our routine over here you're.
Never gonna break your routine if you.
00 p.m.
Once you're going to absolutely do if we.
Don't wake you up - so cast a lot of my.
Followers have started to follow you.
Because you upload a lot of vlogs on.
Your channel a lot of times obviously.
We're always traveling together so it.
Happens to be like vlogs.
Behind-the-scenes footage yes our meet.
Grace are different events would stop.
What's one thing that people might not.
Know that goes on behind the scenes of.
The vlogs.
Honestly i feel like we're very open and.
Pretty honest with you guys like we put.
All of us out there but i would save it.
We're not exactly always pg and so is.
Youtube monetization i think we cut a.
Lot of like our playful vulgar names out.
A lot of kids onto my videos of a lot of.
Kids watch my videos with their parents.
I do try to always make sure my channel.
Is appropriate for everybody.
We're definitely much crazier if that's.
Even possible behind the scenes yeah i.
Mean you definitely see more crazy stuff.
On my channel then you're just very.
Inside inside look a little better but i.
Do get a little carried away talking.
Sometimes okay all right ready for you.
Sister hey zeus we're gonna have five.
Minutes to do whatever you want to fix.
That.
Over three two one go okay oh get ready.
