I'm obviously a lot better yeah so.
Charlie didn't teach me a lot about.
Makeup and today i'm gonna teach her how.
To dance because she's not really that.
Good like at all honestly and i'm like.
Obviously really good yeah so stop when.
You glue your fingers together all right.
Charlie so before we even get into this.
Makeup tutorial today i want to know.
From you like what is your makeup.
Routine and look like and what table.
Looked you want me to put on you okay so.
My no makeup routine is concealer from.
Breaking out blush okay bronzer mascara.
Highlight i'm feelin pizza.
Okay so you're a very very light.
Coverage paper person i think it's.
Really cool too because we're so used to.
Seeing some of the biggest like stars on.
Different social media platforms hopping.
A couple face the makeup which obviously.
I have no problem with hello i think.
It's really cool that you are in front.
Of millions of people with like barely.
Any makeup on for this videos today.
Though what people look do you want to.
Do you want both lay out oh we can.
Definitely do it folds over you're on.
The right place for that okay well i.
Have a lot of questions that i want to.
Ask you so i get to know you a little.
Better so the viewers get to know you a.
Little better so why don't we just go.
Ahead and jump right in.
Music.
Let's go ahead and get started with.
Moisturizer first i'm going to use it.
The touch out water cream you already.
Have a really really beautiful skin but.
I want to make sure it is nice and.
Supple and hydrated supple i just have.
Supple plump and like nice like smooth.
Okay full okay so the one question.
Charlie that i want to ask while i'm.
Putting on your foundation is obviously.
Going from 0 to 36 million followers in.
The course of a few months is insane.
Congratulations from annoying you behind.
The scenes i know that you're a really.
Really nice person so it's really.
Awesome to like see that you were the.
One who know what has not been like what.
Is if i like to just go from like a.
Normal girl and connecticut to one of.
The biggest influences on the entire.
Planet.
Um it's weird seeing at how things.
Changed you know people like some people.
Will try and go live and try and like.
Talk bad about me trying to make me look.
Like a person that i'm not in a bad way.
So that's just weird seeing how people.
Switch up or like people will say like.
You cut me off or like you're talking to.
Me and i was like you haven't been.
Friends for like four years.
Yeah or like they'll make us seem a lot.
Closer than we were in real life that's.
Weird.
But for the most part like i know who i.
Can trust and like i have my best friend.
Gemma back home like nothing has changed.
Yes what about the positives the.
Positives are i'm getting to experience.
Things that i wouldn't have been able to.
Do if i didn't have this opportunity one.
Of my friends from school who went after.
College was talking to me about how i.
Had said a year and a half ago i want to.
Start youtube i really want to start.
Youtube but i'm nervous kind of people.
Are gonna say.
And they're just like i'm so proud of.
You sorry i'm so proud of you because.
Like you got to do it and yeah this.
Isn't i hit like 1.5 million subscribers.
On youtube they're like that's so crazy.
Yeah we're so scared to do it i got to.
Meet all the people that i've been.
Watching for years yeah do you switch me.
Yeah really well i have like my apple tv.
In my room where like i'd have youtube.
Yeah i'd like watching videos like.
Before i went to sleep.
What yeah i used to i love like makeup.
Like okay i wish i was better at it i.
Used to do like all these my gear.
Palette that's so cool so that's super.
Cool you kinda just like i did grew up.
Like watching youtube yeah would you say.
That like youtube is kind of what got.
You like into social media in the first.
Place like how did the whole like tech.
Talk situation like star um all my.
Friends are doing it that's honestly how.
I got into a to do whatever everyone's.
Making fun of tick-tock yeah like and i.
Was too but it was like that's because.
Like dancing wasn't as big on there like.
It was a lot more like it was the comedy.
Like lip-syncing yeah oh i name is like.
Musically and then all my friends are.
Doing it they're like charlie letting.
These dancing okay they would have me.
Learn the dances so i could teach it to.
Them so they could do take time and then.
I was like i'm gonna get one like so.
Much fun i want to do it and then it.
Blew up very quickly which was weird and.
It was like a pie like 15 videos in.
Which is like nothing yeah.
What i love about the poeple is that.
Everybody has the opportunity to go.
Viral yeah and i think it like that's.
Why i was talking about this earlier.
Today it's hard it took like girl.
Following on a lot of social media.
Platforms like instagram algorithms.
Broken and a million different reasons.
Youtube very very talented because.
Everyone wants to be a youtuber twitter.
People go viral all the time but like.
Just a viral post yeah once and a viral.
Post does not translate to like a viral.
Twitter account but tick tock everyone.
Has like an equal opportunity to go.
Viral and i want to hear your input on.
This because of that i feel like there's.
A far more people that are on checked.
Off that are producing really really.
Good contact because in their heads like.
Okay maybe i'll do this angle.
Yeah and i mean i get asked that.
Question all the time did you want to be.
Famous i was like well yeah of course i.
Was thought it was cool to like be a.
Youtuber right do that stuff but i i had.
Started tick tock like making funny.
Videos with like my friends like it was.
Really never meant to be something right.
It's like i'm gonna do this to get.
Famous and then like figure my life out.
From there like it was such an accident.
Though because all my friends are like.
We're gonna get famous was like okay how.
Are you gonna face off tick-tock right.
Like a lock or just blending in your.
Concealer and we're only to stuff then i.
Think my own competition because i'm.
Actually not as bad as you think so how.
Long have you been even dancing since.
You were five you said i'm dancing since.
I was three been competing since i was.
Five so i obviously didn't have any with.
Abby lee miller this past year i love.
Dance halls i love this like the world.
Of dance i'm not like super.
Knowledgeable in it but i've always.
Found it very very fascinating and i.
Have an immense row to respect for.
Dancers because i suck on it like ah i.
Know my dances are really really bad but.
I think like that's one of the reasons.
Why talk it's fun too because you don't.
Have to be like great at it to like have.
Fun you just have fun and that's all.
That matters but i'm assuming you being.
A competitive dancer helped a lot in.
Terms like just tick tock and stuff i.
Mean probably i got to pick up the.
Dances really quickly which helped i.
Literally watched you watch somebody.
Dance watch it like once and then sit.
There and record and do it right on the.
First try which makes me want to like.
Literally strangle you because it takes.
Me at least like at least fifty loops so.
If you are still doing a competitive.
Dance obviously right now like tick tock.
Is just by thought you have 36 million.
Followers a new thing for you do you.
Think that like competitive dance would.
Be something that you would like want to.
Do is a cup full time job or what do you.
Want to do for like a career right now.
Like where's your hot girl right now.
It's very difficult because i have so.
Many opportunities represented to me.
That i'm just trying to like try.
Everything i just did something for.
Voice acting or a movie oh my god that's.
So cool and i actually really enjoyed it.
They give us something that i didn't.
I was going to like yeah i had a lot of.
Fun with it i would love to do something.
Like that because i tried that a couple.
Days gone and loved it.
Okay there's just so much fun um dance i.
Obviously want to keep up with dance and.
Continue doing that in training and.
Taking classes in which i can.
I don't know i'm down to try everything.
But this is how do you do that with one.
Nostril because i broke my nose are they.
This year no really i've been waiting to.
Surgery for like since august i'm just.
You know i shouldn't be able to breathe.
So speaking of you getting a bunch of us.
Opportunities you've been everywhere the.
Past few weeks to spend it really fun to.
Watch but like what was the what we're.
Like okay i've made it okay so.
Definitely jlo saying she like knows who.
I am and like her kids watch me all the.
Time i'm like oh her daughter she like.
Just came off performing at the super.
Bowl and she was like so excited to meet.
Me and i was like a joking that's so.
Cool that's crazy.
Jalen was like your biggest role model.
Right are you talking about that james.
Charles supposed to be honest that's.
Really true this did happen oh he's a.
Big one when i met him he was really.
Worried over it to be honest yes he.
Dropped he checks me i play lies this.
Particular almost the entire makeup that.
Is such a lie i kept getting walls well.
That was her personal never been like a.
Big a bat as well right yeah and i was.
Only there for one day cuz i my flight.
Got delayed great how did you enjoy your.
Experience of that like it's terrifying.
It was like going oh there's so many.
People and then i was like no it's fine.
They're not gonna come up to me like no.
One cares about me.
Most i've ever heard i walked out and.
Then there was like a bunch of people.
There does it go then i felt super cool.
Do you do well with the crowds and.
Suffer do you like meeting a lot of.
People i love meeting people i like.
Meeting them in smaller groups yeah some.
Reason because sometimes i'll feel.
Overwhelmed so i try to keep my college.
Which i can but i also get a lot of.
Anxiety when i'm around a lot of people.
Yeah and i come here really scary and.
You know what i've kind of noticed over.
The past a few years especially with me.
Cuz i used to be the same way like i was.
Always so concerned about whatever.
People would think but i've like fans.
And just like people like viewers in.
General have gotten way better about.
Respecting that stuff so i own it uh.
There's like a growing crowd of people.
That are.
Starting to understand like okay these.
Like a lot of these influencers i have.
Like a huge following like this is not.
Like this is dangerous.
Yeah i mean there's of course the people.
Like that it's mostly the parents that.
Are like yeah straight up with rude like.
I had a mommy yell at me once i was in.
The middle of eating dinner and i was.
With all my friends and she like called.
Me out specifically and i was like with.
All my friends and i had a really really.
Just horrible day and of course no one.
Knows that i'm not gonna post like me.
Just being upset there's a lot of stuff.
Going on right and my friend's mom was.
Like hey we're just going to eat dinner.
Right now do you think you could just we.
Just to come a minute so they can like.
Eat and are like well she's not gonna.
Die she doesn't eat right now is she you.
Know one i was like i'm sorry like i can.
Take it and she's like you know what.
This is making you look really bad and i.
Literally crying she was like i have a.
Little girl here and i said you know.
What girl you just made me cry good good.
What i didn't mean to it was like well.
You did good and then she was like i'm.
Following and i was like just mean.
Because i wasn't even like i literally.
Said i was gonna do it after and like it.
Was gonna take five obviously i was so.
Hungry i hadn't eaten all day great and.
You have a right to eat that's the one.
Like i love meeting people i will always.
Say pictures people the one time i will.
Always say no is it what i mean a or not.
Always just say we'll come in the back.
There oh yeah yeah hey i'm so sorry like.
I'm to the bathroom and they can see the.
Page so like maybe right now i'm always.
Okay i'm always late to meetings and.
That's like they want to ask me take.
Talk something i'm so sorry.
I literally have to go right now yeah.
I'm really sorry that obviously not.
Everybody can be a respectful of you.
It's really it's like one of the worst.
Part about being an influencer.
I see other things like people post.
Things and then like everyone colonies.
To like wherever i am sometimes that'll.
Let go - those are my cousin's wedding.
You told me about this i can't even.
Believe this actually happened yeah.
That was like a group of like four girls.
Who got ready and pretended that they.
Were cousins with my cousin and that i.
Think that is literal psychopath.
Behavior there's no other most of this.
Right back to him and he was like hi.
Guys who are you nice to meet you and.
You they can do i do they work i was.
Like oh that's so crazy.
That's annoying kids are some things.
Where i want my like privacy and it was.
Like my cousin's wedding with my family.
Not the appropriate time at all so that.
Was like really really weird.
Okay so aside from obviously privacy.
Problems what would you say has been the.
Biggest change from your life beforehand.
To now just like the day-to-day stuff i.
Can't go out looking like trash if.
There's people there and then look like.
Trash i'll say it yeah and then it just.
Like makes the picture i'm comfortable.
Because i know i look bad you don't look.
Bad it's usually when i'm getting coffee.
To which is my safe do you feel like.
Pressure to always look good you know.
Can i sleep with this one i wouldn't.
Recommend bad but no ever no never.
I'm taking like an hour-long nap like in.
The middle of the day if i'm like in.
Between days and never something upon.
Ever no do about that it's for your skin.
Do you know how much energy you need to.
Take your makeup off agreed are you done.
With the base i think so yeah i haven't.
Done did james charles export a pallet.
What color is that we want to use you.
You pick you have for creative i know.
But i wanted to i want you to like it.
Maybe we should have matched the hoodie.
I thought could be like a cute little.
Pastel moment yeah.
As we start with this one is gonna be.
Dipping into some different colors.
Matching the hoodie i said when i keep.
Talking cause i have a lot more.
Questions for you and i have a little.
Bit more like a serious i share that.
What you don't hope you answer if you.
Don't want to but i know that you've.
Talked a lot about unlike different.
Socials and stuff but or anybody isn't.
Also like your private sas affairs like.
My favorite era world i know you're.
Dealing with like a lot i'm doing a lot.
Right now do you feel like you're being.
Pulled and like a million different.
Directions and how was that like.
Affecting you.
So you even want to talk about it.
Ya know i've actually never talked about.
This and the slightest before i have to.
Beginning when this all started i was.
Very very overwhelmed yeah and i was.
Still going to school and full-time like.
Going to a middle school right like i.
Was in public school yeah i was.
Traveling a lot i always had something.
To do and i felt like i just had no free.
Time and then as time started going on i.
Started doing online school which was.
Great i loved it so much i mean i was.
Struggling because there were so many.
Things i felt like i had to do and i.
Felt like i didn't have i really well.
Put together schedule back then and i.
Just felt like everything i felt like.
Everyone was yelling at me to like get.
Stuff done yeah and i was like i don't.
Know how to do it all cuz i think.
There's i just feel like there's so many.
Things that i have to do you were my my.
Excuse for most things was like i just.
Did i had no idea right i had stuff to.
Do that i would know about but i'm still.
Obviously a teenager and i would just.
Forget or take a nap or get tired like i.
Was really struggling with that but now.
Associate my family we're a lot better.
On making sure like oh i have something.
This day like let's not unpack i just.
Was getting so so so tired we're even.
For a little bit i realize like my.
Videos were not good because i just are.
Like it wasn't having fun yeah and then.
Took a little bit of a break from.
Everything and stopped so i can focus on.
Myself and then now i'm getting back.
Into the meetings and still doing work.
Stuff but also being able to do all the.
Fun things and like really getting to.
Sit and enjoy them everything just like.
Worked out in the best way i'm really.
Glad to say that you're like handling it.
Better and all of it like when i first.
Saw your story i think i was horrified.
For you and like i remember i said.
You're really like long message and.
Stuff just like because i won't do the.
Same thing obviously you grew way fast.
Knighted and i think just tick tock is.
Just a different pop from an environment.
In general but like i have somebody.
Who's like very very business minded i.
Love being overworked and stuff but at.
Times like it was so because if you.
Don't enjoy that it's obviously like a.
Recipe for disaster and even for me as.
Someone who did enjoy being over it.
There was days where i would go home and.
Just crime.
To see precisely i just feel like i'm.
Like so overwhelmed it can't handle all.
This i my entire life like especially.
Growing up a competition inter and like.
Having to have not a lot of free time on.
My schedule i've been used to like.
Working hard from the second i wake up.
To the second i go to bed make sure i.
Get all of my stuff done it was just.
This was so different than anything i've.
Ever done before on a more positive note.
Now that you are managing your time.
Better what do you like to do for fun.
Aside from making tic tocs and dancing.
Well i always in really enjoyed painting.
I mean really i was like mom can you get.
Me like some canvases in pe and so is.
Her painting and i had a lot of fun with.
It i wasn't that good but it was just.
Something to do.
Mm-hmm when i was like just doing.
Nothing right i got into doing makeup.
Because i was really into art in the.
First place so i don't get to do that.
Much anymore either but i also i love a.
Good procreate oh man now what it's time.
For it lashes now we're having a little.
Bit of a dilemma because i really wanted.
To do like a natural lash on charley and.
After checking the collection we.
Realized that we don't have ones that's.
Really good i'm clearly a really good.
Beauty girl but like i said obviously.
I'm a dancer so this is just like a side.
Job yeah so honestly as the makeup.
Artist you should been prepared yeah i.
Know so that's really bad i'll be.
Leaving you a bad review but that looks.
Good do you like your dress fired yeah.
Yeah okay the eyes are done i love how.
They turned out it's a cute little.
Pastel moment snapped in the hoodie.
Available soon as sisters apparel calm.
Now it's time to go on to highlighter.
Well my favorite part about your face is.
You aren't freckles that you have.
Naturally we cover that with some.
Foundation so i'm going to go ahead and.
Draw your ass back on period cute looks.
Just like normal me yeah okay wow i wish.
You wish what little bit is your face.
Right now.
Okay so we're pretty much almost done.
And last not least we're going to have.
The lips.
Yeah okay now alas not least let's do a.
Cute little gloss i think all right miss.
