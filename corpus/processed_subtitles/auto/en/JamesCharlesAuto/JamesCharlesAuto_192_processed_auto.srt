Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel.
Normally in the beginning of each video.
I say that i'm very excited but no cap.
For this video i am too nervous not.
Excited in this latest pin that is.
Because we were doing something that is.
A little bit triggering to me the past.
Like few weeks on youtube i've been.
Watching a lot of nostalgic content for.
Some reason i don't know what it is but.
Like the whole recommendation system has.
They given me a lot of things from my.
Childhood i've been watching poptropica.
Tutorials for some reason mario kart.
Videos tumblr theme coding videos like.
Everything that i used to do when i was.
Like 10 years old it's all coming back.
To me and what are my really good.
Friends larry a few days ago uploaded a.
Video where he went on omegle no hits.
You don't know i've never been on a.
Before omegle it's basically a website.
Where you can log on and you can video.
Chat or text strangers for free and if.
You're thinking to yourself well that.
Sounds kind of dangerous you're.
Absolutely right and i would definitely.
Not recommend doing this um if you see.
My coming out video you would know why.
This is very triggering to me and if you.
Haven't seen that video don't worry.
About it nothing said for today's.
Youtube video i thought i would log on.
Back to amigo for the first time in like.
10 years and i would ask strangers to.
Pick my makeup routine i truly have no.
Idea who we're about to meet on this.
Website today from what i remember a few.
Years ago it was either our musicians.
Playing their songs or other tumblr kids.
That all have the same muffle emo.
Haircut as i did.
Or like autobots or a lot of really.
Nasty old naked men so for the sake of.
Both my eyes and yours i am sincerely.
Praying that we will meet a whole lot of.
Sisters that are able to help me pick my.
Makeup routine but without further ado.
Let's log on and find out.
Music.

The self-worth and come jump right and.
