Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel happy.
New year everybody i am so glad the 2017.
Is over thank god it was a roller.
Coaster every year with a lot of highs.
And lows if you'd like to check out my.
Year in review video that i put up last.
Week i am so proud of it make sure to.
Click right up here but i am so excited.
To move on to bigger and better things.
This 2018 although nothing really.
Happens when it becomes a new year it is.
A major opportunity for everybody to.
Kind of start fresh and just stay.
Motivated and inspired and of course we.
See everybody posting their new year's.
Resolutions and goals across all social.
Media and one thing we see all the time.
Is new year new me first today's video.
We're going to be doing exactly that.
Becoming a new me when it comes to your.
Favorite internet personalities there's.
Usually a really really big fandom.
Behind that one person which we like to.
Call stands and stands like to do edits.
We get all sorts of amazing fan our.
Drawings paintings makeup recreations.
And one tip at a weekend all the time is.
Pumpkin i've seen a lot of people on.
Youtube but recreate their punk edits in.
Real life by like dyeing their hair.
Getting fake piercings and of course.
Press on like water tattoos but for.
Today's video.
My job is obviously a makeup artist so.
I'm gonna be recreating my punk edits.
With makeup one feature i see all the.
Time in punk edits is the cat scratch.
Eyebrow i've worked way too hard on.
These have tweeze them to death to get.
The perfect shape so i'm definitely not.
Shaving to scratches in my eyebrows.
Today so i'm gonna start off with my.
Elmer's washable glue stick and glue.
Down just the second half of my brow you.
Guys see me do this a million times now.
In different drag video so if you really.
Want to know how to glue down your.
Eyebrows definitely check one of those.
Videos i'll link them somewhere up here.
On the screen so you can get a more.
In-depth tutorial once that brow is all.
Glued down and dried i'm just gonna take.
A powder puff and some translucent.
Powder and pack it there to really lock.
Those hairs in place so we can cover.
Over them.
I'm gonna use my kryolan tv paint stick.
In the shade and be to cover over those.
Hairs oh my.
No house a good route cover whoa and.
Then just applying a really light layer.
Of the too faced born this way.
Foundation all over the rest of my face.
Not really for like a glam look just for.
Like kind of more even a skin tone all.
Throughout when it comes to the neck i.
Am actually gonna grab a lot more.
Foundation than the face and really make.
Sure to blend that in and pocket kind of.
All over because we're gonna be putting.
A lot of tattoos here and this we do.
Really want a full covered even skin.
Tone so we have a good base for all the.
Drawings i'm gonna go ahead and do the.
Rest my base off camera today just to.
Save some time like i said we are not.
Going full glam just adding a little bit.
Of dimension back to my face just make.
Everything kind of more even edit ready.
For a tattoo for my eyebrows today we're.
Gonna start off by filling in the base.
And mica brow gel from benefit and.
Number four so how basically my brow.
Shape all sketched out and like i said i.
Was gonna make them really really close.
To my normal brows i just didn't want to.
Obviously shape a scratch in them so i'm.
Gonna take my shape tape concealer on.
Just the back of my hand and a tiny.
Liner brush and i'm gonna sketch out my.
Cats raj this is definitely like an.
Interesting look not really sure how i.
Feel about it so far wow.
Grayson dolan is shaking so one thing i.
See all the time in punk edits and like.
Face tattoos is a lot of people get.
Tears right here and i think that means.
The amount of people that you've killed.
I mean for me personally i don't know.
About any of you guys but killing people.
Is exactly on my 2018 agenda so instead.
Of putting a tear right here i'm gonna.
Put the adidas logo please sponsor me.
Music.
This is already turning out to be so.
Much harder than i expected oh my god.
Okay so another trend i see all the time.
In face tattoos is a big word and.
Cursive right above this eyebrow.
Obviously reading from left to right so.
This might be like mirrored on the.
Camera you're just had to trust me here.
I don't really know how this is gonna.
Work or turn out we're just going with.
The flow but since this is like right.
Near my brain i'm gonna put the word.
Sisters because you guys are always on.
My mind that was so cheesy oh it is.
Gonna be backwards you're kidding.
I can always flip the footage i don't.
Know why so myself up to do this.
So obviously this side of my face is a.
Little bit intense right now we.
Definitely need to balance that out on.
This side so since we've been using my.
Kat von d tattoo liner i figured i would.
Add some stars to this sided honor of.
Kat von d but using an x liquid liner i.
Music.
Know that milk makeup literally makes a.
Like star eyeliner stamp that i could.
Just be putting right all over my face.
Right now but of course i did not have.
That or do i nope i don't one person.
That was iconic for their face tattoos.
Is lil peep rest in peace he's gone away.
Too soon not only was he an amazing.
Musician but he was also an openly lgbtq.
Person in the rock community which was.
So amazing so in honor of him i'm gonna.
Recreate some of his face tattoos he had.
A horseshoe right in between his.
Eyebrows for a good luck and since his.
New year is starting and we had quite a.
Rough last one we're gonna need it he.
Also had a broken heart tattoo right.
Here on his cheek and i'm gonna recreate.
That today because lord knows i'd had my.
Heart broken by a far too many stray.
Bullets and a lot of punk edits people.
Usually edit their ears to be pierce or.
Like a gauge in their ear with a really.
Really big earring obviously my ears are.
Not even pierced so i'm gonna draw one.
Huntin eye using some more eyeliner oh i.
Feel like at this point my face is that.
Pretty much done and honestly i'm not.
Even gonna lie i kind of like how this.
Looks i really thought i was gonna be so.
Spooked by myself but i really don't.
Even mind this like a punk.
Sister and chains inversion anyway i'm.
Gonna go to move on to my neck one.
Tattoo that i see all the time on bill.
People that are covered in tattoos or.
They may even just have one or two are.
Roman and numerals most people tend to.
Get a really significant date tattooed.
On them such as like the death of a.
Really close relative or the birth of a.
Child or an anniversary date but for me.
I have none of those things so i'm gonna.
Do my birthday i love myself.
You.
Music.
There we go may 23rd don't forget to.
Wish me a happy birthday.
Another tattoo that i see all the time.
On different people is a rose this is.
Gonna be really really challenging and.
I'm kind of already regretting this but.
I'm gonna try to place a rose right up.
In here wish me luck.
Music.
This was literally the one of the worst.
Cities i think i've ever had once i have.
The rough and i do mean very very rough.
Outline of the roads i'm gonna grab my.
Morphe e39 brushes just this very very.
Very tiny little brush and dip it to.
Some black eyeshadow and try to shade.
The rose a little bit honestly not bad.
Another thing that i saw a lot of these.
Edits were a butterflies butterflies are.
Super intricate and usually their.
Patterns are very very symmetrical and.
Beautiful so i'm gonna put this one a.
Smack dab right in the middle of my.
Throat so i can actually see it in the.
Freaking mirror and we can hope they.
Make it really really good okay honestly.
Not even gonna lie that butterfly turned.
Out a lot better than i was expecting.
Kind of living for this i think the last.
Like big major tattoo i'm gonna do is.
Gonna be right over here i'm gonna put a.
Crown there because i'm the queen of.
Music.
Drawing on besides my neck is literally.
So hard i can't even begin to explain to.
You guys how much pain my eyes are in.
Right now i feel like they're about to.
Pop out of their freaking sockets they.
Should not be looking all the way over.
Here but we're gonna make this work.
Music.
Alright guys those are all the big.
Tattoos finished my eyes currently feel.
Like they're going to burst out of my.
Head so i'm gonna take a quick little.
Break then i'm gonna come back and do.
Some tinier ones just in between to kind.
Of fill the space off-camera and i'll be.
Right back with the finished punk at it.
In real life with makeup look all right.
Sisters i am back it has been about two.
Hours now meeting i've been working on.
This for literally four hours but i.
Think we are finally done with the.
Finish line before we actually did.
Makeup i used to draw all the time when.
I was honestly really really good at it.
I used to practice every single day and.
I would draw portraits and all sorts of.
Intricate really beautifully shaded.
Drawings so going into this i really.
Didn't think this is gonna be that much.
Of a challenge for me in particular.
Point was i wrong though hence now this.
Is probably the hardest makeup challenge.
I have done today i've talked about this.
In a few videos before but i don't.
Exactly have the most steady hands i.
Usually will start shaking if i get.
Really really nervous or if i'm trying.
To work on something very very detailed.
And intricate so this was a major major.
Challenge for me i think by far the.
Hardest part of this entire challenge.
Was this rose tattoo even if i was.
Drawing a rose on normal paper i think i.
Would definitely have some trouble just.
Because the shape and overall form of.
Rose is very very hard to capture on a.
2d flat surface but it was even more.
Difficult because it's on the side of my.
Neck where i have to literally like turn.
My eye all the way over here to even get.
A decent glimpse at this area and i.
Still can barely even see what i'm doing.
My eyes literally were in so much pain.
By the end of it but i think it turned.
Out descent i already loved and.
Respected tattoo artists before i used.
To watch tattoo videos all the time on.
Youtube and would always want to go with.
My friends when they got them done just.
To see the artist in progress but i.
Respect them even more now after trying.
It myself because this is so hard.
Alright sisters and that is all i have.
