Hi sisters james charles head welcome.
Back to my youtube channel i know this.
Whole vibe is a little bit different.
Than what you're normally used to it has.
Been a hot minute since i've had a hat.
And glasses on on a youtube video but.
For today's video actually have.
Something that i am really really really.
Excited about and that i've never done.
On this channel before and that is a.
Drawing video in last night's video i.
Recreated a bunch my followers makeup.
Looks and literally thank you guys so.
Much for all the love and support on.
That video if you have not yet seen it.
Click right up here it was so fun to do.
But i was actually reading through all.
Of the positive comments and so many of.
Them were actually talking about how.
Amazing the looks were and how they.
Actually required a lot of artistic.
Ability and i was getting a lot of.
Questions at whether or not i was able.
To draw i've talked to this a few times.
In different youtube videos but i've.
Never ever gone fully in depth and.
Before i ever was picking up a blending.
Brushes and beauty blenders and.
Eyeshadow palettes i was actually.
Drawing for the entire first half of my.
Life and i was not gonna lie pretty good.
At it if i do say so myself my all-time.
Favorite medium to work with was.
Charcoal and with charcoal i really.
Loved drawing portraits i've always.
Obviously had a very huge interest in.
Human faces which clearly translated.
Into my love for makeup getting to do.
Art on my own face but i would always.
Creep or just a really really powerful.
Woman that i've looked up to i've done.
Cara delevingne at kendall jenner kylie.
Jenner but it's been at several several.
Years since i've actually done one today.
So for today today i thought i would.
Just sit down and chill into a little.
Chitchat art with you guys i've never.
Done this before i'm super super excited.
For today's portrait i really want to do.
This picture of demi lovato that i.
Printed out you guys know i literally.
Love dummy she's one of my biggest role.
Models and she's also so beautiful so i.
Think she'll be really fun to create.
Today i have no makeup on this is just a.
Very very chill vibe so hopefully you.
Guys like this video and without further.
Ado let's get to a sister sketching.
Music.
Okay so let's jump right into it this is.
Probably gonna take me a several several.
Hours i'm guess i'm just gonna be.
Switching between like this camera and.
Then this camera and like time-lapse.
Hello so let's just get started i have.
My notepad here of charcoal paper and i.
Have a few different charcoal pencils of.
Different hardness i have these good and.
Fresh cysts or blending stumps and then.
Of course i have this reference image of.
Dummy that i printed out literally hello.
She looks the best ever in the entire.
World so i'm going to try to recreate.
This image today okay so i guess i'm.
Just gonna first start off by sketching.
Some of the light outlines of her facial.
Features using the really really light.
Pencil i know a lot of people say don't.
Outline like it's against the rules of.
Artistry when literally hello how else.
Are you gonna know where to put your.
Things so we're outlining today her face.
Probably goes to about here in the photo.
And then her hair is covering it so i'm.
Just going to sketch in some hairs okay.
Her lips are probably gonna be about.
Here on this photo i'm pressing really.
Lightly my pencil as well because i.
Don't want to add too much color right.
Away since this paper is white i.
Obviously can't go any lighter with it.
Then white hello.
Color you can only go a darker so i'm.
Being really careful as to where i.
Actually put any pencil because it's.
Gonna be really hard to lighten things.
Later on a little bit also this top lip.
Here leslie she's a pretty rounded.
Cupid's bow actually um let's catch our.
Her sister schnoz jeff lee is a short.
Brown tail so probably right about there.
I guess that's kind of all we need to.
Start sister shading a little bit so now.
That we have two basic kind of layout of.
All of dummies and facial features i.
Guess we get to go in and start shading.
Now and this is by far my favorite part.
Of the entire process i love love love.
Shading it's kind of just like.
Contouring of the face where you get to.
Really identity'.
And highlights and shadows and just make.
Everything come to life so let's start.
Sister shading i want to avoid any.
Smudging as i possibly can so i guess.
We're just gonna start right up here and.
I'm just gonna grab my hb pencil from a.
Faber-castell and kind of lay down just.
A really really light wash of color i'm.
Going in super super light with this.
Because remember you can always layer on.
It's very very very easy to add in any.
Shadows but it's extremely hard to bring.
Back any highlights but it's also.
Important to keep in mind nothing should.
Ever be white except for the highlights.
In somebody's eyes or on the face and.
Like the lips then i'm just going to.
Take one of my up blending sums this.
One's kind of like a medium sized and.
Start to blend out that shading to.
Create smooth transitions.
If anything ever becomes too harsh - i.
Really like to use these gummy erasers.
You can get these at any art supply.
Store and you can kind of use this and.
Lightly kind of drag over the image to.
Pick up a little bit of that pigment i.
Really really love these racers for.
Doing this they work so much better than.
Normal pencil erasers would definitely.
Recommend i'm gonna go to the little bit.
Of a deeper pen so now this is a a 4b.
Which lays down color a lot harsher than.
A normal to be white or than a normal hb.
Would i don't even know what these.
Pencils mean i'm not even gonna lie to.
You guys i just know this one's deeper.
So we're gonna use that one now i'm.
Gonna lay down this one right alongside.
At dummy's hairline because obviously.
We're gonna be drawing and hairs on.
Later on but there's definitely an.
Intense shadow going on in this region.
And i need to add this to the picture.
Just gonna grab a blending stump and.
Blend that out so now that we have like.
Kind of the base the forehead it laid.
Out obviously we're going to come back.
To this far later on but i want to keep.
Moving downward so i'm gonna grab a dark.
Pencil and i'm gonna start off doing it.
Demi's eyebrows and i'm just gonna.
Basically do this by drawing in really.
Really light hair ashok's.
Kind of in the same way that i would.
Normally do my own eyebrows in makeup i.
Definitely don't want to start off too.
Harsh and turn into sharpie brows.
Because we all know what that looks like.
I'm gonna go to the eraser like pinch it.
And take this little dot kind of and use.
This to go right in those brows and kind.
Of erase just some of those areas that.
Look a little bit more harsh to kind of.
Bring back some of the original paint.
But underneath until it--and everything.
Up so it looks more natural.
So now we get to start off by favorite.
Part of the entire portrait which is.
Always at the eyes i'm first gonna start.
By shading the area that the eyes are in.
So i'm just gonna grab my light pencil.
Once again and kind of shade this inner.
Corner i'm at dummies and nose bridget.
Just to lay down a light base then same.
Thing i'm here i'm gonna lay some color.
Down right above the eyelid fold and we.
Have to create that kind of rounded.
Shape right up here with the brow bone.
Doesn't gonna follow the eye shadow.
Shape as well and bring some of this.
Color upwards just kind of like a.
Transition shade and makeup and then a.
Little bit below as well making sure to.
Leave open a white space which is where.
The waterline will be later on i'm.
Actually so excited to be drawing demi.
Today you guys know heike how much of a.
Huge fan of her i am the rich is like.
The only person to actually like stan.
Even though i literally hate that word.
She's just so talented it's not even.
Funny i want to do her makeup so bad.
Although joe pell glam does do a pretty.
Good job but like demi needs a sister.
James snatch she follows her on.
Instagram we've dimmed back and forth a.
Few times about it i'm supposed to do it.
All but she's i feel like my dream club.
I just oh my god i feel like i could do.
So many beautiful things with demi who.
About to me claiming her and then like.
Singing together actually that's a bad.
Idea.
Imagine me clamming her and then her.
Singing to me and me not opening my.
Mouth and being silent much better.
Option okay so now i need to turn.
Eyelashes which i'm actually kind of.
Scared for because i do have a tendency.
To definitely over draw eyelashes and.
Then they turn from like eyelashes into.
Like i fur and that's definitely not the.
Look we're going for today i definitely.
Wanna give her like on miami lash as.
Opposed to like a fluffy lash if you.
Know what i mean so we're gonna be.
Really gentle.
That's like four eyelashes okay at the.
Beauty guru and we needs to calm down a.
Little bit so this is gonna be a.
Scenario where i should have done the.
Left eye first.
So my fault but i'm gonna grab a tissue.
I'm gonna put this over the eye that i.
Just did so i can work on this eye.
Without rubbing the side of my hand.
Against the entire drawing let's do the.
Eyebrow first.
Music.
Okay so i need to start shading in.
Dummy's nose which i'm really not.
Looking forward to being that noses are.
By far the hardest part in my opinion in.
Any portrait because one wrong shading.
Moment and like literally the entire.
Nose is gone.
We gave demi a rhinoplasty sorry sister.
So i'm gonna try at my absolute best to.
Follow the shading in this original.
Picture and cross my fingers and pray to.
The lord and having a bob that we can do.
This oh that was all supposed to happen.
Speaking of things that were not so so.
Happened.
Oh great segue james this weekend i just.
Went to tanic on well didn't go to.
Tannic contactually went to the area of.
Tannic on and then proceeded to not.
Attend tanyka and it was interesting to.
Say the least.
That's all i want to say on that.
Probably can't wait for a hashtag sister.
Cloud 2019 i want to take one of my tiny.
Blending sums now that already has some.
Charcoal on it and i'm actually gonna.
Use this to create some of the freckle.
That demi has on her nose.
Okay this is like not bad team is demi.
Music.
She doesn't have a slight butt chin as.
Well which can relate so i'm just gonna.
Sketch that in and make sure i leave.
Like a little bit of a shot a moment.
There so i can kind of shape that in.
Place and it going up on this side of.
The jaw she definitely has a much more.
Intense shadow so i'm gonna grab a much.
Darker pencil this one is 6b and keeping.
In mind who's gonna be here here in a.
Little bit i'm just going to place in.
Some of that pencil to blend out in a.
Second okay so i'm gonna move on to the.
Lips now and lips have voiced assume.
That i've kind of struggled a little bit.
Just being that similar to kind of like.
I was saying in the forehead earlier you.
Have to really keep in mind the.
Lightness areas because it's hard to.
Bring it back once it's gone and when it.
Comes to the lips you have to make them.
Look wet looking which includes a lot of.
Highlight it looks like her makeup.
Artist use kind of like a gloss over the.
Entire lip area as opposed to kind of.
Over lining the actual liberation if.
That makes sense do you guys know what.
I'm talking about so i'm gonna try to.
Create this shadow over top of the.
Actual lip region i'm just using a light.
Pencil okay so i know that this lip.
Looks really really weird right now.
Trust me um hello i see it too but if we.
Actually compare it to the reference.
Photo as you can tell all of the kind of.
Dark shades and medium shades are there.
All i really need to add back in is.
Going to be the highlight shades which i.
Have to add on with a pen later on so.
I'm actually gonna leave this how it is.
Right now surprisingly.
Music.
Well that actually didn't take as long.
As i was expecting it's my talk that.
I've been doing this for a little really.
Like six hours now so that's really fine.
And brush but now we'll finish up i.
Guess the neck and the hair which should.
Be pretty easy so i'm just going through.
My darkest pencil and i'm drawing in.
Hair strokes all around where the edge.
Of dummy's head is going to be i'm not.
Realizing that this entire outside area.
Is gonna be filled with black so instead.
Of wasting this charcoal pencil i spent.
A lot of money on and sitting here.
Scrubbing the entirety of this canvas i.
Just found this can of a black paint.
Which i got when i moved into my.
Apartment hashtag not sponsored but i'm.
Gonna actually try to paint the entire.
Outside edge with block instead.
Hopefully this isn't the worst idea ever.
I can't find my brake paint brush so i.
Guess i'm literally just gonna use a.
Morphe 57 brush to paint this entire.
Thing so usko genes for 10% of your.
Purchase.
I'm gonna grab some white paint also on.
A morphe this brush and draw in some.
Hair highlights okay you guys i'm so.
Nervous i don't know why what the heck.
Okay three two one okay on camera low.
Key looks pretty good in fresh their.
Sister dummy seven hours later i'm.
Really really proud of the finish result.
Let's be real it is definitely not.
Perfect it could look a little bit more.
Like dummy i definitely wish i didn't do.
The paint on the background i think it.
Looked a little bit too dark and the.
White spots on the lips i don't know how.
Artists normally do that because.
Whatever uh pens i was using we're not.
The tea but i feel like this is a solid.
Like a nine out of ten and i'm just.
Really really happy to be back in my.
Roots and what really got me into art in.
The first place being at portraits i had.
So much fun drawing sister died when you.
Said it and i really really hope i did.
Her justice she is by far one of my.
All-time at biggest role models i am so.
He loved her i think she is by far one.
Of the most talented vocalists of our.
Generation her vocals are truly.
Unmatched you can fight me on that in.
The comments down below.
She is so unapologetically herself and.
She's also just the most stunning person.
Ever so i really really want to do her.
Makeup one day that would be so awesome.
And i really really hope you guys.
Enjoyed this more like chillax.
Sit back james painting day it is not.
