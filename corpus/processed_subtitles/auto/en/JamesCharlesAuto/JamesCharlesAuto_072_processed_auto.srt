Mr. james turrell let's hear it come.
Back to my house you got for today's.
Brand-new video we're going to do it a.
Sister sanctuary to us but you think.
About two years ago now i officially.
Moved to los angeles to pursue my really.
Close friends were all in orange county.
And whittier so it was kind of right.
Smack dab in the middle no job town was.
A really really good and fun impressed.
For about five days and after that if.
Then we want to dot every single day how.
Do you guys to see that the constant.
Mental breakdowns over the sirens over.
The lemon ways it over the sky people.
Are going out late at night and also the.
Imminent issues have really affected.
Them on youtube have a growth this past.
Year it's been a initiate simply so.
Regardless the asian is now over cuz.
I've been saving quality have a big.
Sister sponsorships and we were.
Obviously the movie bless us right now i.
Just kissed my downtown america goodbye.
Sister sayonara never ever but it was.
Empty through so many of them every sip.
Each other but not we are here we're.
Very much i mean right now in the movers.
Secondly remember that ana put it all.
Before we do that in circles and getting.
It set up i was just doing a little bit.
Of an empty house work for you guys.
I thought they did plan on doing a.
Finished house crawler and kind of a.
Little bit of a decorating series as.
Well because you guys know i really.
Really love interior design so i thought.
It would be actually really cool to do.
An empty house write a finished house.
Tomorrow so you guys can really see the.
Before the planning process and the dog.
Have a little hgtv they are shaking so.
Hard and i was gonna make the black and.
White and answer em selfies personal.
Problems.
The reconnaissance do you do before and.
There's a beautiful quiet please i think.
This would be a little chill and i.
Really would put a couch in this general.
Vicinity somewhere and there's gonna be.
A grand you know right there in this.
Corner but my god you know obviously.
Music plays a huge role in my life and i.
Do play the keyboard of my ear but i've.
Been wanting a grand piano since i was a.
Little boy we could never afford ads.
Have been there growing up and aaron.
Burr saving up for a little keyboard it.
Was on for months as a child so my wife.
A grand piano has been a huge role but i.
Don't know.
It's gonna be right here it's in the.
Linear pathway and then i can play over.
The speakers in the ceiling there are.
All hardwired so i can listen to my box.
Anywhere in the house all day long.
Really what i wanted to do individual.
House to begin with i think just really.
Cool to kind of bring a little nostalgic.
Element from the delta apartment back.
Here to this house and beautiful i think.
A huge table for amenities you're.
Probably just gonna protect it right.
Here i honestly don't worry anticipate.
You think this room very often is.
Probably gonna be one of those rooms.
That are very much first show all the.
Way eating will probably be happening.
And my bed or on the couch in the living.
Room which you guys will see in a second.
Or at the kitchen counter because it's a.
Huge movie like tonight over here and.
This is a big open foyer area and family.
And everything right now i'm gonna be.
Helping contribute to do job great but.
There's going to be a car park there.
Eventually.
You guys know obviously i'm your uber.
Everywhere and i think it's time for me.
To get a card now that i have a house i.
Guess it's a lot but i actually do have.
My license i can drive i'm just really.
Not good at it so if you find out about.
I-19 you know makeup artist crushin.
There's three try again sometime soon in.
The news this this absolutely my office.
For myself my team at worst or did you.
Tell me just myself i do now have an.
Amazing group of people that work with.
Me every single day to make this full of.
Video consoles possible and make sure.
They have a really comfortable and.
Beautiful and bright thanks to work.
That's why they can be happening right.
In here so the way the office we have.
This beautiful.
Music.
And here it's too cute little room for.
Many guests that are over i love the.
Same things too like this is so cool.
It's like a fire hose love that some.
Water it's so vintage and then in here.
This is supposed to be the office space.
It's just literally a white box but if i.
Have a missus way too small if i were to.
Be working here i would probably get.
Really stressed and like cram and.
Washable recognize it a little bit so.
That we can hear my house positive.
Potential of like a recording studio and.
My start shaking use it more seriously.
But really fun but now for a house is.
Really deku sticks so coming out of the.
It sisters to do times potential.
Exercise rooms large white box that i.
Can lock it in and he's being annoying.
Whenever that cooking made me back to.
The foyer this is going to be a wall of.
The entire house and this is obviously a.
Wine cellar.
While james why does your wine cellar at.
Your favorite wall at the entire house.
Let me tell you why i'm here all the.
Internals because guess what's not going.
To be there why because it's very just.
Then was insane well that's very much.
Material we know these two kinda way.
Exploding we're talk which are actually.
The only two lights i'm going to be.
Keeping in this house i really love this.
I think they are so beautiful and kind.
Of odd to have like the rustic farmhouse.
Back which is definitely what i want to.
Go for i'm gonna have a coffee machine.
Probably in there.
When i'm getting too lazy to cook those.
Days and that huge beautiful.
Refrigerator which i will probably keep.
Very little if there is that night but.
One of the main issues with is the.
Projectors times day based light meaning.
I can never watch anything during the.
Day which is usually pretty good for it.
I was able to really keep some.
Self-control and to get my work done but.
There are definitely days where that's.
Built watching out like something a huge.
Tv right smack dab in the middle right.
Here we talked about some of the core.
Pieces and huge l-shaped sectional right.
Friendly to my moving up process and.
I'll show you guys the little backyard.
Moment how these dogs are also here -.
They will not be staying unfortunately.
But me and definitely do plan on.
Adopting a puppy as soon as we get in.
And get some i am so beyond excited.
So students about that side there is a a.
Huge tv and fireplace which i think is.
Actually so so so cool i want to put a.
Cute little seating area here so i mean.
All my friends kids show up during it.
The cool summer nights and then we have.
These beautiful backyard so the grass.
Area is definitely not as big as i would.
Want to be i grew up in upstate new york.
And i'm used to having a ton of property.
I think the house that i grew up in was.
Literally five acres which is any.
Nature-lovers tree which may come as a.
Little bit of a surprise to you guys.
Because i'm very much an inside home.
Internet kid but i definitely do love.
Nature and the rocks and so my next.
House that i move into will have a huge.
Backyard i'm promising myself that right.
Now but i think i'm just gonna put a.
Hammock over here maybe some lawn chairs.
Next to of the pool and probably gonna.
Fix this dead of grass patch because.
It's not looking the best.
Caroli is the careers of everybody in.
The makeup industry yes what we have you.
Have this little concrete and girl area.
Similar to the kitchen i'm probably not.
Gonna get a whole lot of use out of this.
But i do have a lot of best friends and.
A lot of their husbands love to cook and.
Grill my best friend laura her husband.
Victor loves girliest will definitely be.
Cooking lots of good and fresh big beefy.
Needs right here we do have a huge.
Beautiful swimming pools i know beyond.
Excited about a little house we'll take.
A video i am so excited to have a.
Swimming pool to be able to jump in i'm.
Really hot dave it gets so hot outside.
I'm literally sweating for me.
Literally like 30 seconds that has taken.
Us to film this clip now so that's good.
And we do have a cute little photo as.
Well so we can tell accident on the.
Colder in the winter so this must.
Actually 5 bedrooms which is so much my.
Last the purple was technically three.
But one of those bedrooms was i'm.
Walk-in closet and the other one with my.
Filming space and the lock was button so.
Even though i had a three bedroom it was.
Only really what was being used and.
Didn't always that asleep on the county.
News over it so it all my friends when.
They have sleepovers which was really.
Only not fun i'm really excited have a.
Lot of space everyone to sleep and hang.
Out i always have friends over no matter.
One day and they're very very close to a.
Lot of the people in my leg i like to.
Just make them feel at home and make.
Them feel confident self this house is.
Gonna be crazy to you but it is a.
Laundry room and do you know why i'm.
Excited about this because i have a.
Washer and dryer and i'm going to be.
Able to do my own laundry why are you.
Excited about that james your house can.
But let me tell you if you get to see in.
A few episodes of brother and sister.
Meeting to talk about how the lottery my.
Own.
It was scary it was in the basement it.
Was dark all the machines were broken.
Almost every single time i literally.
Left loads of laundry in there and came.
Down like five minutes before my local.
Machine was going to be done i don't.
Have people taking my clothes out of the.
Machine because they wanted to cut.
There's any staff like that it's scary.
So i've been working as long as i was.
Really generous to make sure my clothes.
Were clean and not drugs but i'm so.
Excited to be able to actually get my.
Laundry done myself make sure it's done.
Right to do it safely.
It sounds so stupid but i'm just really.
Excited about so one over this table you.
Have this big storage unit that you're.
Covering every single day second is not.
The actual vegas - i hope that you'll.
Even focus on production rather than.
Make up storage because you guys know i.
Don't only switch up my products that.
Often so i can actually use this entire.
Storage unit to store access paper and.
Then walking up from here we have a.
Bedroom number two.
In truth and the poor cousin it's really.
Beautiful and bright and you know really.
Like this space there's also a pretty.
Thing i can all fit in here of course is.
Revealed as well which i'm excited for.
Obviously you know really really loves.
Fashion luck and he wants to be a.
Regular blogger or 2,000 videos on.
Youtube one day if he ever actually.
Decides to post couldn't tell you i'm.
Gonna be a song and when he comes here i.
Was hip-hop but they'll be able to use.
This woful supposed to distill all his.
Pieces in here to beautiful for his.
Videos obviously like make sure you guys.
Have entered the house or maybe is done.
Move on to the next row so i'm walking.
Up right out over here we have a bedroom.
Number three.
This one is ted or that guest room just.
Just a super simple room so as of right.
Now it's probably only going to be the.
Median sister keehan living and this.
Comes together but we are they gonna dog.
And you guys heard me say that my team.
Was here almost every single day working.
Was really fun i do have actually gonna.
Have a third roommate kinda trying to.
Convince and that's been true to move in.
With us no but sometimes the english.
Inaudible you comment on us because any.
One day in this room or the other would.
Be.
Giroux perfectly fine guestroom throw my.
Family or my best friends coming over so.
We write a lot with this program you.
Have such a numbers door and this is my.
Favorite bedroom that is not the master.
Of the entire house.
There's so great and it is so big the.
Ceilings are actually involved in as.
Opposed to flat which really just makes.
The space feel like a million times.
Larger and it just feels very very old.
Beth and it just is really good advise.
For production videos and it can be.
Really easy to get into a bit of a.
Creative rut so for me can you get a.
Space that makes me feel happy and the.
Life of a week is super super important.
That's our space outside because the.
Closet isn't actually the big s but.
Maybe issue later on but like i say i do.
Want to make sure to go to my connection.
And just don't really like what i'm.
Saying let's make a huge donation of.
Open and bread and makeup products that.
A bumpy our have just never actually.
Used to a local organ something wasn't.
That so so so much to me they were all.
So grateful and so thankful and it's.
Really laughing because i just do guys.
Like that they pretend to be all the.
Time and although i am so thankful for.
It there is just a nobody that i'd ever.
Be able to try all that much makeup so.
We just want to have art to be able to.
Give that stuff away to people who are.
Definitely going to get an amazing do.
Some of that and we so so so appreciate.
About that so that's actually the intera.
Of you need space i'm suppose to all.
Diplomatic and production stuff in here.
At very soon which i'm so excited for.
I'm actually working through to the.
1700s - definitely.
Music.
We do have the best i'm so excited about.
The space oh my heart is literally so.
Like so so is there anything walking.
There are two huge.
But since it's just me it's going to be.
The sister and sisters closet which i.
Obviously love just like i make up my.
