Anyone's ever done my makeup what oh my.
God oh my god this is so exciting so i.
Put together this look on amanda's face.
Today any killing it we came up with.
This cut crease chartreuse liner type.
Situation we really want to just think.
Out of amanda's comfort zone she does.
Tend to wear a lot of very very.
Beautiful and like glam natural style.
Makeup but i really wanted to like for.
Sure and do something that she would.
Never normally do bolt them in and i had.
Very very straight brow shape and she.
Said that creases are not saying that.
She ever does so of course that's what i.
Put on her face today that's looks so so.
Bob if you guys want to see how i.
Created this super fun and easy look and.
Hear all about our lives and all the.
Secrets and all thirteen all the cough.
Make sure you ready again for this keep.
On watching the benefit porefessional.
Primer.
Mainly i use hourglass mineral veil nyx.
Angel ville the porefessional is great.
It's my favorite.
Amanda has like deep most perfect skin.
In the history no way yes sister.
So mays row nation today we're using of.
Course my holy girl and apparently this.
Is amanda's too because she brought it a.
Makeup ever ultra hd foundation shake in.
45 i was hoping it would.
Be y 315 that's what i should.
I go by the number of mines 120 i don't.
Know donation is the best i've liked.
Everyone so miss amanda do you have a.
New man in your life i do.
So i started dating someone about 7.
Months ago actually did every week it's.
Been 7 months i was in a relationship.
For such a long time that you get so.
Guarded it's so hard to let someone back.
Into your life and your social media.
Your followers like people who watch.
Your videos they're your family so i.
Don't just show them anybody right so.
And i wanted like time to be with myself.
And work out myself and then we met just.
Randomly like at a halloween party and i.
Was like i wouldn't date him that we.
Were friends for a while and then it.
Just like happens to me at least expect.
It yeah those of you guys who don't know.
If you follow me on twitter or snapchat.
You know that i get myself into boy.
Drama quite often like it really excited.
Over like a straight guy and then i get.
My heart hurt for no reason when i had.
No chance in the furnace place i'm very.
Very bad knocking this but recently.
However i've been getting myself.
Involved a lot of like guys so we're.
Kind of on the dl or more like closeted.
Or not really kinda rolled their.
Sexuality but at the same time like.
Still are talking to you which is fine.
But at the same time it's like it's a.
Lot to deal with in it's something.
That's very very powerful just because.
Like i'm so open and comfortable myself.
It's totally okay but it's frustrating.
For me at the same time and it's saying.
That i don't really know how to handle.
And and i have had to sell money like.
Late night like two hour-long facetime.
Calls where she's just like listen james.
Get your together but like oh my.
Gosh she's been like my see it's really.
Not your fault like i mean you have to.
Keep yourself guarded right and it's.
Hard because you wanna believe that.
Someone's nice and they're so nice at.
First and everything's great like how.
Could it go wrong and then they're.
Immature or it's i mean i can't relate.
To the closet thing obviously because i.
Haven't been with that but i just have.
One of my best friends and he deals with.
That too and it just sucks because it's.
Like okay well then what are you doing.
Like i'm not something you can hide.
Right like if you're with me or with me.
Like i want a normal relationship and.
You deserve that but you deserve so much.
Better and like i've told you like it'll.
Weed out all the bad ones to try to.
Waste your time but when i first moved.
To la i didn't go on a date for a while.
I think i only went on a couple.
And they were not good and it was just.
Like i wish i could like write a book or.
Like do like story time videos on all.
The stuff that would happen i don't know.
I how many things that would get i know.
But i feel like a lot of them still.
Watch my stuff which is super weird and.
I don't get them it's like they don't.
Want you but then they don't like don't.
Want you to move on as anybody thought.
For a reason though when i look at all.
The relation to work out i'm like no no.
I'm happy that it didn't work out hmm.
That's one thing they would be every.
Time i've like got into like a weird.
Thing where i've like called you at like.
Three i mean the world a week later i'm.
Like oh my god i think i got something.
It's like it's almost like it.
Rose-colored glasses on or something.
Because they seem so amazing and you put.
Them on a pedestal and then you get out.
You're like no i'm poppin to collect.
Remember space today i'm using the kat.

Keep these ones like on the dl they very.
Very like just like let it happen.
Actually if it's supposed to happen and.
Don't if it's not gonna happen only in.
The past me to be like over excited and.
Like getting my hopes up really quickly.
Has it not worked out see this is my.
Once you get them home the control it's.
Like they know it i don't know what it.
Is they love the chase and then once.
They know that they have you they're.
Like play games see because the thing is.
I like the chase like that's me like i'm.
Barely competitive like i like a good.
Challenge and stuff so like that's what.

Ferocious no you ever as empower wins.
You have to keep the power yeah i'm like.
Flirting though i was like thinking oh.
This movie there's gonna let my flirting.
Is so like strange like i'll be talking.
To some guy and he'll like say something.
Nice and be like i hate you so much died.
Like that in my language that's like i.
Want you to make out me like more than.
Anything in the entire world i don't.
Know why i do it i i don't know probably.
So ugly i don't even know we're gonna.
Amanda's face make for a few minutes now.
While we do that we're gonna move right.
On to it the eyebrows those are a pair.
Of bras right there so people ask you.
Like wine growing recently do so much.
With them i feel like my forehead is so.
Big to it five to you.
We're gonna take a little bit of a cut.
Crease line or situation here on amanda.
So we're gonna be something off with.
Deep morphe 35o palette and once again.
Code james or code amanda for 10% off.
I'm gonna start off by grabbing this.
Liner brush from the morphe rolls gold.
Collection and dip into this warm brown.
Shade right up in here so amanda's.
Latest face is very very similar to mine.
In the fact that we both have a pretty.
Straight brow shapes and not much like.
The way when you actually open your eye.
So i'm gonna have to do a little bit of.
A low cut crease here but that's totally.
Okay and it will doubly look regardless.
There just won't be a lot of like space.
To blend but we're gonna make it work.
As always i'm gonna grab this morphe r39.
Brush and dip into this light warm shade.
Right here and i'm gonna blend out that.
Light a little bit how do you do your.
Cut creases do you like start off by a.
Blending a lot together then deepening.
And then cutting it with concealer.
Yeah usually i'll blend everything and.
Then i'll go in with like paint pot or.
Concealer and then carve it out okay cuz.
I do my cut crease is in a really really.
Different way i will actually like start.
Off by drawing the bottom line and then.
Just blend upwards which i've never seen.
Anybody else do it that way but i feel.
Like that gives me like a really really.
Clean that's smart.
Crease i don't know if you are someone.
If you're definite like wanting to do.
More cut creases you should try it out.
Let me know like how it works.
Yeah angled brush first yeah that's.
What's always worked for me i like that.
Technique really really well i'm next to.
Grab my morphe m 213 and dip into this.
Warm up dark brown shade in the bottom.
I'm just to deepen up the crease line.
Music.
An understanding of this anasazi a for.
Brush limit more of that shape tip.
Concealer just too hard out of the.
Crease this is also why i like starting.
Out with that line rather than just like.
Putting color on there and then cutting.
It later because this kind of like gives.
You a guide of where to like cut the.
Concealer as well it's like the crease.
Is basically does there you just need to.
Clean it up i guess yes do you do the.
Other way around.
I need stupid and now i'm kind of.
Switching a little bit to face first if.
I there was a big did you see the debate.
About this on twitter today it was like.
Yesterday day before it was everyone got.
Like popping off about it i'm most so.
