Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel for.
Today's video i have something not gonna.
Lie a little bit less like implant i had.
A concept for today's video all ready to.
Go ready to film i sat down and after a.
Further thought quickly realized it was.
Not the best idea since i'm an awful.
Youtuber and could not think of any.
Better ideas i'm gonna be reading this.
Makeup book that i did almost two years.
Ago now to date it is still when my.
All-time favorite makeup books that i've.
Ever done but i feel like my skill level.
Has grown so much and i think i could.
Really improve this and make this a.
Really really awesome look not only mine.
Awful youtuber but i'm also unoriginal.
And since last week's video was.
Recreating your guys's makeup looks and.
Today's videos recreate mine i can't use.
Recreating and my title twice in a row.
That'll be really really stupid so i'm.
Gonna make this video also a q&a so i.
Can make the tomato something different.
Love that i've always been k i've been.
Wanting to recreate this look for a.
Super super long time now but creative.
Looks don't really do that well on my.
Channel so this is the perfect excuse.
For me to do a creative makeup look and.
You guys have to watch got you good.
Without further ado i already have my.
Base already on let's go ahead and get.
Started with some questions and some.
Cool lightning bolt makeups i'm gonna.
Start this book off by popping off my.
Eyelashes clearly i'm going to be doing.
A lot of work on my face and eyes today.
So cannot have any of miami's.
Distracting me from that process oh my.
God i just lost that no we're gonna be.
Founder so shut off this lips today i'm.
Gonna lay down just a light base coat.
Using my morphe at 35 p palette and.
Using the blue shade or right in this.
Corner the first question today comes.
From sister alessandra and she says.
Pineapple on pizza yes or no absolutely.
Not i literally think pineapple pizza is.
One of the grossest.
Combinations ever like who wants their.
Pizza to be sweet i know i certainly.
Know i personally am a pepperoni type.
Sister i love me some good pepperoni.
Pineapple absolutely not i'm your ask do.
You want to stay in la or do you plan to.
Move somewhere else in the future that's.
Actually a really good question that i.
Personally ask myself all the time.
Thinking in terms of right now i.
Definitely do plan on staying in la for.
Quite a long time i really really like.
It here i definitely like love the sun.
The warm weather all my really close.
Friends are here aside from my.
Family of course so i really like being.
Here and my job is here as well i feel.
Like i'm always getting a lot of work.
Done as for downtown la definitely not.
I plan on renewing my lease here for one.
More year but after this year i'm gonna.
Save all my money and hopefully be able.
To build my own house which is gonna be.
Such an amazing accomplishment at only.
19 years old so fingers crossed that.
That works out because that is something.
That i'm really really looking forward.
To but i guess i really never know what.
The future holds like i said for right.
Now i'm happy but i definitely want to.
Explore a whole lot more and kind of see.
My options and who knows where i'll be.
Five ten years from now so right now i'm.
Happy as a nellie sister but maybe i'm.
Being and i don't recall one day.
Couldn't tell ya speaking of traveling.
And exploring a new places sister ray.
Asked would you ever go on tour cuz i.
Want to meet you so bad that's a great.
Question sister right i don't know well.
I can't believe my nose contour looked.
So good today and here i am packing dark.
Blue eyeshadow right over top of it and.
Ruining all the hard work i don't know.
What i was gonna say that.
Katelyn ass if you gotta marry the last.
Person that you kissed how would you.
Feel who died oh awful oh no actually i.
Think i feel pretty good about that one.
Yeah i think i'd be okay with that.
Actually on second thought wrong person.
Sister julia oz explain your love life.
In one word intense my ass if you could.
Tell your younger self one thing what.
Would it be.
Shut up i really love this natural.
Everyday glam look that we have going on.
Right now.
Ah briana asked who was telling that you.
Look up to i think that my answer would.
Actually be to people and that would be.
Jacqueline hale and nikkietutorials i.
Remember watching joseline halen wanting.
To literally buy every single product.
She ever put on her face because she.
Looked at that perfect and i were.
Watching nicki and it's just really.
Bringing my true artist out in me i feel.
Like her looks were always so original.
And so creative and i just really love.
That about youtube because do you guys.
Know that's really what got my start in.
The makeup industry to begin with so i.
Really had to say jacqueline her nathie.
Because they've been around for so long.
And i think have generally worked so.
Hard for the platforms that they have.
And truly do deserve it and use their.
Platforms for the best they possibly can.
Which makes me it really really hot.
And makes me happy to call them role.
Models and also really close friends i'm.
Just gonna take the darker blue shade.
And the darker blush lead to kind of.
Create some clouds and some more.
Dimension in the sky.
I guess hello sam asks if you could.
Change one thing about yourself what.
Would it be and why and i'd probably.
Have to say my hairline that's always.
The first thing that i change on.
Facetune i wish it was just like a.
Little bit lower because sister always.
Has a lot on his mind he asked if you.
Could know one thing about your future.
Right now what would it be and why.
Good question probably what social media.
Point that i leave thursday comments on.
Is finally gonna give in and marry me.
Yeah kaitlyn asked if you were stranded.
On a deserted island and you could.
Choose one youtuber to be sharing it.
With you who would you pick and why i.
Think calling back to a few questions.
Ago i have to say it's sister nikki once.
Again i feel like we'd be able to put.
Our creative minds together and figure.
Out some way of like living and.
Surviving also she's like super tall so.
She could probably just reach for all.
The coconuts in the tree that looks.
Pretty what is going on here hello.
Let me forgot how much i hate it working.
A blue eyeshadow and look what i'm doing.
Cover my entire face with blue eyeshadow.
Makes me a face tune john asked what do.
You think about any drama in the beauty.
Community i try not to think about the.
Beauty community tommy asked what is one.
Thing you really want to accomplish by.
The end of 2018.
Now in search of this might be a little.
Bit cliche and it's kind of like a more.
Vague type of situation rather than like.
Once is the next thing but i want.
Everybody at the end of just at 18 to be.
Able to look back on my year including.
Myself and just think oh my god how did.
He do all of that that is what i want.
For my year and i know that sounds.
Really really cliche but i just want to.
Get so much time to be working all year.
Round on so many different projects so.
Many cool opportunities meeting you guys.
Working on new works launches working on.
New videos like literally everything you.
Can possibly imagine.
I just want to do it i'm gonna do it all.
Sisters are gonna take over the world.
Kayla asked if there was gonna be a.
Movie made about your life who would you.
Want to play you oh this is actually a.
Really really good question.
Oh you know why i would pick i would.
Pick sister jake snatched by jake on.
Instagram who runs on my fan page just.
He is literally so cute and i feel like.
He's literally like that meaning me we.
Look alike and he does makeup so he.
Would definitely be a good sister james.
I think i would trust him to play me.
Even though these are pretty big shoes.
To fill.
Bibby asked what is your biggest fear.
Hmm probably a red socialblade just.
Kidding i am deathly afraid of heights.
And snakes.
Oh and bees and dying yeah all those.
Things adrian said quick first all that.
Comes to mind sing it oh baby don't say.
The turk with you between my arms.
Barefoot on the grass listening to our.
Favorite song when you said you love.
Dumbest and cheering sweetie i am so.
Sorry stephanie asked what's one piece.
Of advice you have for someone looking.
To start a career in the makeup industry.
This is a question ntm that i get from.
You guys literally all the time and i.
Think that the best answer i have for.
You it would be to do something that.
Nobody else is doing don't do brown.
Smokey eyes don't do warm half-cut.
Creases and if you're gonna do those.
Favorite looks and that's what you love.
That's fine but just find some way to.
Make your own put your own spin on it.
Make videos with your personalities.
Shining through it just do something.
That's gonna set yourself apart because.
There's a million one people trying to.
Do the same exact thing and nobody's.
Gonna make it with the same definitely.
All seen a million times trust me on.
That it looks like i can barely breathe.
Christina asked if you could design your.
Own escape room what would the theme be.
And how intense would you make it if you.
Guys are part of the sister a snapchat.
Fan which if you are not go add me right.
Up here and as a lent time there all.
Sorts of rants fun activities singing.
And of course sister escape rooms you.
Guys know i do them all the time it is.
Literally my favorite pastime in the.
Entire world like if i find an escape.
Room one day that kills me i'll be dying.
Very happy as crazy as that sounds but i.
Do think about this quite often as.
Bursting as that may seem one thing that.
I would love to see in an escape from.
Would be like a log cabin type of.
Situation like in the snowy hills or.
Something and you only have an hour to.
Escape or else like the abominable.
Snowman or something comes to get you we.
Can work on that part of the concept.
Have really thoughtfully through but you.
Guys know i definitely have a really.
Really intense once i think it'd be so.
Cool to have all different sorts of.
Rooms but i think the one really cool.
Aspect of it sense would be in the snow.
Would be really cool if the room got.
Colder as the hour progressed and by the.
Time like the last few minutes are going.
And be like freezing cold i don't think.
That'd be such a cool out of concept to.
Add it to the already challenging escape.
Room let me know what you guys think if.
You were to design an escape room what.
Would it be.
Leave a comment down below am i bleeding.
Oh that's a mole i'm gonna try to bring.
Up some of the darkness and his i up to.
The contouring areas and kind of connect.
And blend them together to distract from.
The poor blending going on in this.
Region oh that's so pretty.
Alex asked coke or pepsi pepsi.
Hands-down pepsi is so much better even.
Though they've had quite the problematic.
Past so by let me tell you nothing makes.
Me happier in the entire world than when.
I am at a restaurant and someone says.
Nobody wants a drink and i'm like oh i.
Want a coke.
I let me say coke is still really good -.
At at this point it served at most.
Locations so i just gotten used to.
Saying coke but nothing makes me happier.
Than when someone says always pepsi ok.
Yes girl yes.
Pepsi is more than okay god bless you.
Thank you so much for that if you like.
Coke that is okay if you like pepsi.
That's okay as long as you acknowledge.
That there is a difference between them.
Because if you think that they are the.
Same thing we have a problem anna said.
Who was one non beauty youtuber that you.
Would really love to collab with this.
Question i think is really really easy i.
Think my answer hands down would either.
Be shane dawson or jenna marbles their.
Content is so funny and they both been.
Around for so long but continue to make.
Me laugh every single time they upload a.
Video i just like they are so creative.
And just really like killing the game.
I've looked up to them forever i've met.
Both of them so.
Yeah definitely love to do a video with.
All of them kay asked when we get more.
Of the sisters merge i really want to.
Get the sisters barbour talking uh yeah.
Yeah thank you k for always supporting.
That means of the world to me i've.
Actually been getting a lot of questions.
About system paralleled in the past a.
Few days and for those of you guys who.
Haven't noticed don't really know why.
You would this is to prepare website.
Husband down for the past few weeks this.
Is apparel was a first-ever polling line.
That i've done obviously i have no.
Experience in that field whatsoever and.
I will be open and honest and saying.
That it was definitely not the smoothest.
Processes there were definitely a lot of.
Problems when i came to like production.
And shipping and obviously that's not.
Something i want to put my name on to so.
We just ended the process of switching.
Companies and just making sure our.
Production techniques are the best they.
Can possibly be in order to get you guys.
Looking at the cutest you possibly can.
Way way smoother jen said if for some.
Reason you couldn't do makeup anymore.
What career would you choose oh and.
Since i know you'd probably say singer.
You can't choose that either i mean like.
Normal nine to five job damn she got me.
There i feel like if i wasn't able to do.
Makeup or sing i probably doing.
Something involving like numbers and.
Technology in high school my favorite.
Subject was actually math which i feel.
Like it's like breaking the internet kid.
Law because i feel like every social.
Media influencers like i hate math i was.
So bad at it but i really could probably.
Be in accounting because that mixes.
Together like numbers and technology and.
Math and money which i love or also.
Stocks because that combines all those.
Things at plus strategy which you guys.
Know that i love.
Probably socks i feel like that'd be fun.
Phoenix are us will this be the last.
Question of the video yes we're done our.
Sisters and that is this lightning a.
Recreation look a complete i am so happy.
To have this turned on i just feel like.
It looks so electric and bright and.
Beautiful comparing this one to the.
Original look this one is way way way.
Better like i said the original photo.
Was posted in 2016 it's one of the first.
Looks that i ever did it was right at.
The beginning of my makeup career and.
You could definitely see how much my.
Skills have improved since then.
Obviously they are very very similar.
Concepts but the contours are definitely.
Intensified a lot more oh thank god.
There's a lot more dimension a lot more.
Glow a lot more highlights and i'd like.
My line work is just a lot cleaner we.
Added an eye shadow look we have some.
Lashes on i'm just really really happy.
With this turn.
And i really hope you guys enjoyed it as.
Well i also hope you guys enjoyed.
Learning a little bit more about me and.
This q&a like i said this was definitely.
An excuse to do this makeup book today.
