Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel last.
Year i filmed a youtube video where i.
Reached out to some of my favorite.
Celebrities.
And asked them to recommend a product.
For my makeup routine we got so many.
Responses from a ton of.
Really really cool people it was a fun.
Way to try new products and.
You guys loved the video and it became a.
Trend within the beauty community if you.
Guys have not seen part one you can go.
Ahead and click right up here.
But it's been a full year since that.
Video came out i have met so many new.
People made so many amazing.
New friends so for today's video i.
Thought i would do a little bit of a.
Part two and dm a whole different group.
Of celebrities and ask them to pick my.
Makeup routine i have quite a lot of dms.
That i need to now slide into so let's.
Go ahead and get started.
Music.
All right you guys we're gonna start.
Setting a few different dm's in the.
Order of my makeup routine so of course.
We first have.
Foundation and i have a few people in.
Mind that i want to reach out to.
Starting off with the pregnant.
Soon mother to be miss gigi hadid i.
Literally love her the absolute most we.
Were actually damning back and forth.
This morning hopefully she'll respond.
And be able to recommend a really cute.
Foundation to get that pregnancy glow hi.
Angel i hope you're doing absolutely.
Amazing all of your pregnancy photos.
Have been so beautiful and i cannot wait.
To see you be an incredible mommy with.
Your gorgeous baby.
Just thinking about a baby between gigi.
Hadid and zayn.
Like that baby is going to be a.
Supermodel one day i'm filming a video.
Where i asked my favorite celebrities to.
Recommend a makeup product that they.
Love do you have a favorite foundation.
That you love that emphasizes your.
Pregnancy glove just in case miss gigi.
Is too busy being a mother to be i.
Thought it'd be really cute to deal with.
Somebody else that i absolutely love.
That always has really flawless skin as.
Well.
Miss miley cyrus hi sister the night sky.
Is such a bump i've been listening to it.
Literally non-stop.
Do you have a fave foundation okay.
Scent next for concealer i definitely.
Want to mess with somebody that always.
Has like a painted and like.
Beat face so i think i want to damn it.
Mara carol g.
Perfect okay just in case carol doesn't.
See i feel like it could be funny.
Devices somebody that would have like no.
Idea what concealer even is.
Should i message like diploma okay.
I know you're always on stage performing.
Do you happen to know of any great.
Concealers you've had on.
That i should try out he's gonna have.
Literally no idea.
Okay so while i'm on the topic of my.
Favorite hermanas i thought it would be.
Cute to dm miss.
Rosalia oh my god i've seen her live.
Before and her performances on stage are.
So.
Like crazy and beautiful so she.
Definitely has to have a powder that.
Locks her makeup in.
All day hola rina i'm filming a video.
Where i ask my favorite celebrities to.
Recommend a product for my makeup.
Routine.
Do you have a setting powder that.
You love love you okay so for contour i.
Definitely want to reach out to people.
That have like very structured beautiful.
Facial features.
And the first person that comes to mind.
Has to be miss alexa to me from euphoria.
She's one of my favorite people i think.
I actually may have reached out to her.
Last year for the savings like video and.
Did not get a response but she did have.
Her collaboration with mac in the.
Meantime and euphoria season two is just.
Starting right now.
So it doesn't hurt to at least try to.
Shoot my shot again.
Oh my god she hasn't posted on instagram.
Since march 5th she's not seeing this.
Okay well considering miss demi has not.
Posted on instagram in almost four.
Months now i definitely want to reach.
Out to a few other people.
Just in case she doesn't respond so i.
Also want to dm rita ora.
Do you have a contour product that you.
Love that i should try out.
Her night rita and i have dm back and.
Forth a few different times out and i.
Love her music so hopefully i think that.
She probably will see this okay so now.
For blush i definitely want to try.
Something new so i thought that i would.
Dm.
Somebody very very legendary that also.
Fun thought happens to be my new.
Neighbor.
And she's coming out with her own makeup.
Line very very soon selena gomez i've.
Seen an interview that she doesn't use.
For social media but hopefully her team.
Will be able to pass the message along.
Or i'll literally just go knock out the.
Door myself.
Hi never hope you're doing amazing i'm.
So excited for rare beauty do you have a.
Favorite.
Blush that you think that i should try.
Out.
Scent okay so for bronze study i.
Definitely have the perfect person in.
Mind that has to be.
Doja cat if you guys have not yet seen.
Her nice collaboration together click.
Right up here it was.
So much fun to film and the look was.
Absolutely sickening also if you.
Remember from the video she was.
Extremely.
Particular and specific about how she.
Wanted her eyebrows she almost didn't.
Trust me in the first place to do that.
Oh.
I like to do my own brows usually oh but.
She's a.
She's an mua now we ended up slaying.
Them in the end so i know that she'll.
Have a really good recommendation hi.
Babe hope your is speaking.
English spanish and french.
And i know you're super particular about.
Your brows.
So which product should i use to slay.
Mine next in our makeup routine is going.
To be the highlighter and i have the.
Perfect person in mind that i want to.
Reach out to for today's video and that.
Has to be the queen herself.
Jlo i think that i dm'd her last year.
For this video and she did not respond.
But regardless i'm going to ask her.
About my highlight.
Just in case jayla does not respond i.
Definitely want to reach out to somebody.
Else that is known for having a.
Beautiful.
Glowy skin i've talked about her many.
Different times in videos but i've never.
Actually met her before.
But i think i want to message miss emily.
Ronachowski.
So for the eyeshadow look today i.
Definitely want to reach out to somebody.
That is going to give me like a crazy.
Fun suggestion not just like oh put a.
Neutral brown in the crease.
So i need to think of something that's.
Like crazy and the first person that.
Comes to mind.
Has to be cardi b so i'm going to reach.
Out and say hi.
Sister how's your whop doing today.
Hope you liked my danced video.
Oh my gosh she quote tweeted it and i.
Was just so embarrassed for myself.
Party's makeup artist erica is so.
Talented and always puts really really.
Beautiful looks on cardi.
So i feel like she should have a good.
Suggestion okay so once the eyeshadow.
Portion is all complete of course we.
Have to move on to the next step which.
Is going to be.
Oh selena just responded she said this.
Is so cute let me facetime you.
Oh what the heck oh my god fun.
Hi sister hi honey how are you i'm doing.
Good how are you.
Oh doing the absolute best that was such.
A fast response queen.
Literal queen well selena i'm currently.
Filming a video where i dm.
My favorite celebrities and ask them to.
Pick a step in my makeup routine and i.
Know.
That you have something i can see in the.
Background you have something very.
Exciting coming with miss.
Rare beauty i know and i'm more excited.
Just to like give it to people.
Have it in their hands and just to see.
What you know these artists are going to.
Do and i'm so so excited to see.
You know what we could do together and.
Like how you're going to turn it into.
Something.
Beautiful for all your sisters dude we.
Have to film a collaboration together.
Soon when i glam you up it'll be.
So good yeah wait and i know that i'll.
Maybe i'll just drop off some stuff.
Because they live like five minutes from.
You oh my god that'd be literally.
Perfect well i need a blush.
Recommendation for this video do you.
Have a blush with rare beauty yes i do.
So this one is my absolute favorite.
Okay so i've been using this.
All the time okay it is so yummy because.
It's.
Very it's super pigmented oh love that.
Wow love this live application.
Right there and blend and add as much or.
As little as you want.
I'm very proud of my blushes so this.
One's the matte.
And then we have some dewy ones that.
We'll share with youtube oh my god wait.
So am i gonna be the first one to get.
The pr packets then.
Oh wow this neighborhood thing really is.
Coming in handy hot when does it.
Actually launch.
So by the time that this video goes live.
Then it'll be out oh my god period well.
Make sure you guys go shopping beauty.
Right now.
No thank you girl see you soon bye after.
Eyeshadow of course comes our mascara to.
Finish off the entire eye look and pull.
It all together so i definitely want to.
Reach out to somebody that is known for.
Having.
Really really good lashes and i think i.
Want to dm.
Kourtney kardashian i know you're all.
About natural makeup so i was wondering.
If you have a favorite mascara.
That you recommend okay so our makeup.
Routine is almost done we only have one.
Step left and that is of course going to.
Be the lipidy doodahs i want to message.
One more legendary person to end off.
This video and that has got to be.
Miss naomi campbell first of all she.
Definitely knows her way around the.
Makeup chair and full glam considering.
She is literally the most iconic.
Supermodel in the entire world.
But i was also a guest on her show no.
Filter with naomi literally this morning.
Coincidentally that i'm filming this.
Video she was literally so nice and we.
Talked all about beautiful makeup looks.
So i feel like she'll have a really good.
Recommendation for lips to finalize the.
Whole look.
All right you guys we are back it has.
Been about a week since we filmed the.
Intro to this video i thought i would.
Give you a cute little.
Update because we've had this one for.
Several days now and he may look all.
Cute and innocent right now and a lot of.
The times he is okay but i am.
Very convinced at this point that satan.
Himself is literally inside of this dog.
Because he's still nibbling on all of us.
He's gone to the bathroom inside.
Several more times very much unlike finn.
Finnegan on the other hand is a little.
Angel just sleeping on the filming room.
Couch could not be any better behaved.
And this dog.
He's really giving me a run for my money.
But theodore will become trained and he.
Will be.
A good behaved member of the charles.
Family huh.
All right you guys i am so excited ready.
To jump right in for a final makeup look.
Today my skin is not having it so it is.
Time to move on to our first step which.
Is going to be a foundation.
And we did get a response from the queen.
I keep saying the queen the legend that.
I found like shut up james.
Shut up i reached out to a few different.
People and i got a response from gigi.
Hadid she said hilah thank you so much.
We are so excited oh my god i am too.
My favorite right now is the maybelline.
Dream radiant liquid a couple drop mixes.
In really well with my moisturizer but i.
Can also use more and layer up if i want.
More.
Full coverage and feel so smooth and.
Light on the skin i went and picked up.
The maybelline dream radiant liquid and.
I grabbed shade number 50 for myself.
Which is a creamy.
Natural so i'm just going to go ahead.
And apply this just like normal.
And see how it looks okay we're just.
Going to go ahead and apply that right.
Onto this.
Music.
Oh that's one of that's literally one of.
The best foundation matches i've ever.
Had in my entire life oh.
My god are you what are you literally.
Kidding me that little oh.
I'm literally so excited right now not.
Miss gigi i did give me my brand new.
Favorite foundation are you kidding me.
Okay i'm just going to go ahead and.
Blend this all over the face.
Moving right along to our next step of.
Course you guys know it is going to be.
Concealer and we actually got two.
Different responses for.
Concealer the first one being from diplo.
Which i honestly was.
Not expecting at all he actually sent me.
Back a video which i will apply for you.
Guys.
So you said this one tart this is.
Obviously shape tape which i use.
All the time so i think for today's.
Video actually going to go with our.
Other suggestion.
Which comes from miss carol g and she.
Said she said babe i use a concealer for.
Urban decay that i love by the way i'm.
Flying to well late this weekend.
Okay first of all i grabbed the.
Concealer right here that i'm going to.
Go ahead and use but also.
Please let me know if you guys want to.
See a makeup tutorial las panolo parte.
Dos featuring somebody.
Super cool like imagine like carol g or.
Like rosalie or like kimberly louisa.
Another youtuber let me know if you guys.
Want to see that video down below wow.
This color is really.
Really light for me but that's my own.
Fault not carol g's i'm definitely gonna.
Have to make this work.
Okay well the base is looking really.
Really cute so far and now it is time to.
Set it all in place with of course a.
Setting powder and for this i got a.
Response as well from.
Rosalia and she said hi i love this one.
Hope you're doing well.
Celia i love you the most girl i hope.
You're doing well too and she.
Recommended the.
Mac blot and plus the mac blot and.
Pressed powder which i've actually never.
Tried out before.
But definitely i'm pumped to try i.
Am not exactly sure how a blotting.
Powder is going to work to set the.
Entire face.
But open to everything okay i'm not 100.
Sure how i'm thinking about this whole.
Powder situation that being said i have.
A feeling that this would be a really.
Really good product to use once your.
Makeup is already completed.
Like if you get oily or anything to just.
Like get rid of the natural oils but it.
Did at least lock my makeup in place now.
That the base is all done it is.
Definitely time to add back some color.
And dimension to the face because we.
Definitely need it right now and miss.
Rita ora did come through with a.
Suggestion she said hi beauty first of.
All i love your videos i watch them and.
Obsess with your face rita i am obsessed.
With you and your face and your music.
And she recommended.
The tom ford shape and illuminate.
Bronzer aside from the eyeliner which i.
Do actually use all the time i don't.
Think i've ever actually tried any.
Tom ford like makeup products so i'm.
Definitely excited to dip in and.
Oh it's a cream bronzer.
I don't know what this means you can't.
Really put creams over top of powders it.
Like doesn't really blend well and i.
Just set my face in place.
Okay let me just try this i'm gonna grab.
My rare beauty foundation brush which.
Did come from.
The selena package which is the next.
Step um i really like this brush spoiler.
Alert and dip into this.
Music.
Product this is not weird as well this.
Is my fault.
Um wow okay i'm just gonna really pat.
This product in and try to blend it down.
As best as i can.
What child chat i mean that looks okay.
Yeah yeah i should have opened this.
Before i got started because this would.
Have been probably beautiful like right.
Over top of the foundation.
Do you think yeah i did blend it out and.
I think that it looks cute and it is now.
Time to go on to the next step which i.
Am.
So excited for and that is of course.
Going to be blush as you guys saw in the.
Beginning i got an unexpected facetime.
Call from my good friend and now.
Neighbor miss selena gomez she.
Recommended that i try the rare beauty.
Liquid blush in the shade bliss which.
I'm going to do.
Right now but i'm honestly so excited to.
Try out the rest of the products as well.
And selena and i have been talking about.
Doing a collab in person once the world.
Is a little bit more.
Back to normal that would be literally.
So much fun so definitely let us know if.
You guys want to see that okay now.
Selena did tell me that these blushes.
Are super super pigmented so i'm just.
Going to do a tiny few dots on my face.
And start blending it out.
Oh my god wow that actually oh that.
Color is so pretty.
Are you literally kidding me i was.
Definitely a little bit concerned with.
Putting a liquid blush over top of.
My powder that layered on literally so.
Nicely and it's such a gorgeous.
Wash of color are you literally kidding.
Right now i'm actually gonna add a.
Little bit more.
Okay i may or may not have went a little.
Bit overboard with the blush but i've.
Been.
Loving vibrant colors recently i think.
This looks super super cute selena you.
And your team.
Killed it with this formula i am.
Obsessed with this blush and honestly.
This color and i'm so excited to check.
Out all the other products as well.
Our next step is going to be eyebrows.
And we did get a response from my good.
Sis miss.
Doji cat now at first she suggested that.
I should use peanut butter.
Just so funny and then after prying she.
Suggested that i use anastasia beverly.
Hills which is definitely my favorite.
Go-to brow products as well so i'm just.
Gonna grab my little angled brush and my.
Anastasia brow powder in the shade.
Medium brown.
And go to town just like normal all.
Right you guys the brows are now done.
And slayed and it is time to move on to.
My favorite part of my makeup routine.
You guys know.
Is the eyeshadow portion and i messaged.
Cardi b hoping for a crazy look and she.
Definitely.
Came through cardi sent me back a few.
Different voice memos which i actually.
Cannot play.
On video one because they contain.
Personal information but also two.
They hinted at something that i really.
Was not planning on telling you guys.
Just yet because i wanted it to be a.
Surprise but in a universe where there.
May or may not be.
Not confirming or denying anything a.
James x party collaboration coming in a.
Few weeks from now.
Imagining like if i was planning out.
That collab if it was to actually happen.
Don't really know.
I may or may not have sent cardi a few.
Different look ideas one of them.
Including a whop makeup look and she may.
Or not have told me to do that makeup.
Look for this video.
Because we're gonna do something if we.
Were to do something.
Um even more iconic for that.
Long story short too long didn't read.
Cardi told me to do a makeup look.
Inspired by the    music video and i.
Have the perfect look in mind to do.
Seven days a week.
All right you guys so to start off this.
Waff inspired look i'm first going to.
Grab an emma 506 brush and dip right.
Into the dark brown shade in my palette.
Called tea and i'm going to start.
Packing the shade right into my crease.
Just kind of laying that color in there.
And i'm going to draw on in the shape of.
A typical.
Cut crease next i'm going to grab my.
M456 brush and dip into a coated james.
And i'm going to start buffing out that.
Dark brown.
And then with my m514 brush i'm going to.
Dip into 508 and use this as my.
Transition shade.
Now with another blending brush i'm.
Going to dip into a little bit of rusted.
And a little bit of your kidding as well.
Just add a little bit more orange depth.
Into this.
Crease and now finally i'm just going to.
Grab a tiny little fluffy brush the m562.
And dip into a little bit of.
Benny and i'm going to use this to.
Deepen the crease even more with a.
Little bit of a face on a pencil brush.
I'm just going to use this to highlight.
My brow bone now that our crease is all.
Laid down and blended out of course it.
Is time to cut it so i'm just going to.
Grab a little bit of.
Concealer and a flat top brush and i'm.
Just going to.
Carve it out then grab a little bit of.
Canvas on a flat brush i'm just going to.
Set that concealer in place.
Okay so i want to go ahead and add a.
Really cool cheetah print effect to this.
Eyeshadow look personally i am not.
Really the biggest fan of animal print.
However.
I do think both cardi and kylie looked.
So so sickening in the music video.
And when i showed this look to cardi she.
Was obsessed with it so i'm gonna.
Put that on the eyes i'm just gonna grab.
A tiny liner brush a little bit of.
Concealer and then just start making.
Random little.
Splotches in the eyeshadow just like.
That.
I'm just going to lightly dust over.
Those concealer splotches with the light.
Orange color on our fluffy brush from.
Before just to kind of set them in place.
Then you're going to go ahead and grab.
Any black liner i happen to pick up the.
One from rare beauty just because i want.
To try it out.
For this look and we're going to start.
Adding the little like cheetah.
Spots basically in all those little.
Spots that you created you're just going.
To.
Honestly messily start adding like.
Little like circles.
Around them there we go now using the.
Same colors from before i'm basically.
Going to start sketching out a.
Smoky liner just using a little bit of.
10 off to start adding in.
The top color and then using a little.
Bit of tea and no beans to add in a.
Little bit more.
And then finally grabbing benny and just.
Patting this right onto the lash line to.
Create that liner.
Look now for the lower lash line just.
Repeating the same exact process in the.
Opposite step so grabbing a little bit.
Of.
Spooky and benny and then getting a.
Little bit of 10 off okay now i am.
Literally.
Praying that this does not mess it up.
But i think i'm going to grab a little.
Bit of the electric cake liner from.
Anasazi beverly hills the norvina.
Collection.
And grab the purple shade inspired by a.
Megan's look from the video.
And add this into the crease and last.
But finally not least i'm going to grab.
Just a little bit of.
Face and ring light mixed together and.
Pop that right on the inner corner for.
Some nice.
Glow all right you guys that is one eye.
Of this cardi b wolf inspired look all.
Complete i think this turned out.
Super super cute but it was very.
Challenging so i'm going to cut do the.
Other eye off camera which is going to.
Take me quite a while and i'll be right.
Back to finish off the rest of the look.
All right you guys we are back with the.
Eyeshadow on both eyes all complete i am.
Literally loving this look.
So so so much but it is not done just.
Quite yet we still have to of course add.
On our lashes and we did reach out to a.
Few different people for mascara and we.
Got a response from the one and only.
Kourtney kardashian courtney said that.
Her top three favorite mascaras are the.
Item.
Beauty lash snack lengthening mascara.
She said josie maron argan oil black.
Mascara and also the ilia limitless lash.
Mascara oh all those are quite the.
Mouthful but i do actually have.
Addison's new item beauty mascara right.
Here that i'm so excited to try out so.
Let's go ahead and.
Pop it on oh i love how tiny this wand.
Is oh my god this mascara is really good.
My bottom lashes are you literally.
Kidding me right now i will definitely.
Be adding this to my favorites kit.
Addison you low-key really really.
Snapped okay now it's time for lashes i.
Think i'm gonna pop on.
These of course we have highlighter next.
Although the lack of.
Powder is kind of giving me that look.
Already but i do want to add a little.
Bit of extra glow.
Unfortunately jlo did not respond but we.
Did get an answer from a supermodel.
Herself.
Miss emily radachowski and she said hi.
James huge fan and we also share the.
Best lawyer this is true we do have the.
Same lawyer funny enough and she said i.
Love this super random one which is a.
Highlighting drops from sleek and then.
Thank god she said also i love the.
Charlotte tilbury sticks too now.
Literally i looked.
Every single place you could possibly.
Imagine for the sleek drops and i could.
Not find them and i needed to film this.
Video today but thank god i could find.
The charlotte tilbury highlighting.
Sticks and these look really really cute.
As well so i'm just gonna go ahead and.
Pop this on all right you guys well.
Speaking of supermodels we are finally.
On the last step which is going to be.
The lips to finalize the entire look and.
Tie it all together we did get a.
Response from.
The number one the only and a new friend.
Of mine miss naomi campbell she said.
Favorite lip color at the moment is.
Boudoir rose 522 by pat mcgrath lab.
Gives us a hint of pink and a natural.
Glow.
And i need to go ahead and pick up this.
Very lipstick right here.
Oh i'm not exactly sure how i feel about.
This specific color with this look.
But naomi is a queen so we're going to.
Trust her input and hope for the best.
Oh it's more like a lip tint okay this.
Is cute okay you guys this glam process.
Has lasted forever so last but not least.
I'm gonna take my own recommendation and.
Use the morphe prep and set setting.
Spray use code james for 10 off to lock.
This all in place.
And finally that is this makeup look.
Chosen by my favorite celebrities.
All complete sisters i am so in love.
With how this makeup look turned out.
Today oh my god i cannot wait.
To take a photo doing these videos is.
Always so so much fun but also a major.
Risk as well because you really never.
