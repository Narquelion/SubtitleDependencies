Hi sisters james turrell turn welcome.
Back to my youtube channel you guys for.
Today's video i am a little bit doing.
Something that i've wanted to do for so.
Long now this has been on my video id.
List for like a million years i don't.
Know why i've never gotten to it i think.
I've been too scared of the idea but you.
Know what i love a good sister challenge.
And for today's video i went to hobby.
Lobby of michaels every craft store i.
Could possibly find and i'm gonna be.
Getting a fully ready hopefully using.
All art supplies at this point i think i.
Am a little bit a broken record was.
Saying like oh my god i started doing.
Makeup for the are we gonna james you.
Think you're talented who art has always.
Been a huge huge huge passion of mine.
And it's what got me into makeup but.
Even before doing makeup i was always.
Drawing always painting always coloring.
To a lot of the materials they have here.
In front of me such as chalk pastels.
Paint brushes watercolors face paint and.
Sponges i am definitely not a stranger.
To but they usually do not go on the.
Face i think this we are really fun and.
Potentially dangerous challenge.
Hopefully i don't get a break out from.
Using this stuff on my face but you know.
What that's why it's called a challenge.
I got without further ado let's jump.
Right into the video for foundation.
Today i got this tempera paint by upon.
Reading the label that says warning not.
Safe for consumption can cause cancer.
Great so this is not happening today i'm.
Just gonna use my normal foundation and.
Powder but i did find these natural fine.
Sponges at the craft store so beauty.
Blender never heard of her.
We're gonna use a natural fine sponge.
Today i just went ahead and dampened and.
Then wrong on my beauty sponges in the.
Sink i'm gonna grab my two-faced for.
This way in the shade a warm nude you.
Guys know this my all-time favorite and.
I'm gonna put it on my artiste palette.
Today when i think of artists why i was.
Like the first thing to come to mind a.
Little french man with a beret and a.
Little mustache painting it a little.
Easel we wait i am an artiste.
Okay first foundation brush today i'm.
Gonna use this one an actual paint brush.
And i'm going to get my little palette.
And brush it on oh the brush and then.
Apply it to the canvas oh my god low-key.
Want to supply really really nicely.
Hello what's going on - my fellow beauty.
Gurus out there who may be watching this.
Video i don't ever want to hear a single.
One of y'all ever say.
I'm just gonna paint this on until using.
An actual paintbrush surprisingly this.
Is like not that bob can't forget to.
Blend down the neck that i'm just gonna.
Take one of my own natural blending.
Sponges and dip it into the access.
Product on at the pallet and use that to.
Kind of stipple it end oh my god this is.
Kind of working picasso is gonna be.
Trembling in his grave can i say that is.
That offensive for a concealer of course.
They're gonna grab my tart shave tape.
And this is in the shade light neutral.
And i'm gonna put it o want my little.
Pal ain't i need to stop doing about.
Right now and then to apply i'm gonna.
Use this filbert 8 brush this literally.
Looks like a more pm 2 to 4.
Conspiracy-theory morphe brushes are.
Just artist brushes repackage whoa.
Low-key why is this brush like really.
Good this is doc really staying in my.
Collection for hot dog creases you've.
Got to be kidding me okay once again.
Beauty sponge to blend it all out now.
That my face is all set in place i'm.
Going to set it using another natural.
Sponge and then it's the laura mercier.
Translucent setting powder this i'm.
Actually scared about okay i'll sit in.
There oh god so now that we have the.
Base all down in set in place we can.
Finally start building on top of it.
Using our art supplies so for contouring.
I think i'm gonna go into this 48 colors.
Soft chalk pastels kit and hopefully.
Find a warm tone a contour shade in here.
If i can get this open okay so we have.
Our two sets of pastels right here the.
Way it was packaged but it looks like.
There were more inside and they're not.
So our contour options here are very.
Very limited as you can tell the only.
Two shades that may help us out are this.
A very very bright burnt orange and this.
Very very dark brown this could be where.
It goes back to cause my face today i'm.
Going to use this masters touch oil and.
Acrylic.
Number four thirty round mop brush once.
Again morphe is there something you're.
Not telling us okay maybe if i like.
Scrape off oh my god some of the pigment.
Oh there we go okay there's my word.
Bingo we've cracked the code ladies i'm.
Just gonna scrape off a little bit of.
The.
Burnt orange shade as wells we have like.
A blush situation gonna grab my around.
Mop brush and dip into those two.
Pigments tap off the excess and.
Hopefully wow a benefit hoola bronzer.
Whoo kat von d shade and light palette.
Whoo anasazi beverly hills contour kit.
Never heard of her.
Okay clearly we're going for a beachy.
Sunkissed look today that's what we're.
Going for yes correct.
I obviously love that i'm complaining.
About my face being orange when i just.
Used this to contour oh god i'm gonna.
Attempt to contour and snatch my nose.
Instead of using me once again oil.
Acrylic 425 obul mop brush once again.
This is literally a fluffy crease brush.
What is going on say a silent prayer for.
Me on this one.
Oh okay not the worst but definitely not.
The best i'm gonna grab some more chose.
As a setting powder and another natural.
Sponge and just use this to bake my face.
To not only lock everything in place but.
Also hopefully bring back a little bit.
Of my natural skin tone because this is.
A little spooky mokuba all right so.
While we're baking in the oven we're.
Gonna move on to the next step which of.
Course is going to be my eyebrows and.
You guys know i usually live for a good.
Eyebrow pencil but what i don't like.
Using is brow powder so i'm gonna take a.
Break from the acrylics for a short.
Circuit and today i think i'm gonna use.
These watercolors just gonna grab the.
Little paintbrush that came in the set.
And dip into my little cup of water dip.
Into the brown shade which is very very.
Warm.
Oh god this could be bad i'm also gonna.
Grab some block two because that sounds.
Scary okay here we go.
This could be good then i'm just gonna.
Apply it using an angled brush that i.
Found once again at the earth store oh.
Oh oh my god i love that i am literally.
Sliding this challenge what is going on.
Music.
Yo why is that brow low key fire oh i.
Love this so much.
Oh my god you're literally kidding me.
Wow i am looking to makeup invented glam.
The other gurus could never the other.
Guy wow.
Once again anasazi beverly hills whoo.
This challenge surprisingly is going.
Very very well so far all right so now.
That the brows are all done it's time to.
Move on to the eyeshadow and i'm really.
Really excited for this obviously this.
Is the part that i can shine in you guys.
Know i love a colorful eye shadow looks.
And i feel like i literally have the.
Morphe a35 be here or sitting in front.
Of me actually you know what more p35.
You sweetie i am so sorry.
Use ko james her tempers up but you know.
What this could be a really really great.
Second alternative so i'm just gonna go.
In and so i was like am and see what we.
Can come up with i guess i'm gonna go.
Ahead and scrape all my colors in the.
Beginning to get the pigments ready for.
You so i'm first gonna show off with.
This yellow shade that i'm gonna use.
I think decrease i'm gonna grab this.
Hole and shade then this red shade then.
This cranberry shade that is purple.
Shade and then finally just a little bit.
Of the black all right this is what we.
Got going on let's see what we can come.
Up with oh there it is despite the fact.
That these are literally raw segments.
Going onto my eyeball i'm actually.
Surprised at how not pigmented they are.
And how much i actually have to layer.
Them up but i feel like we can.
Definitely make a some form of really.
Cute i look work with this i'm just.
Gonna layer in some red into the crease.
Oh that's penguin ted okay we're getting.
Somewhere we're getting somewhere.
I really want to do a sunset halo eye.
With these colors it's literally one of.
The hardest color combinations to do and.
It also uses a lot of different colors.
So it's a challenge next i'm gonna grab.
This number six round blender watercolor.
Brush literally pencil brush use coe.
James 10% off morphe something you want.
To tell us here i've definitely noticed.
That the best way to get color payoff is.
To definitely pack the color in first.
And then kind of blend it out later if.
You go in and try to like layer up like.
I would normally do eyeshadow it doesn't.
Really show up that much and obviously.
When it comes to a sunset halo eye we.
Kind of need that pigmentation there so.
Definitely pack and then blend if you'd.
Ever be doing this i don't know why.
You'd ever need this technique ever in.
Your entire life unless you're gonna get.
Ready using our supplies but i'm just.
Being the gurus that i am i want to go.
Ahead and cut out the center of this.
Crease and plop summit glitter and more.
Shadows on there so i'm just gonna grab.
That rounded concealer brush once again.
Oh my god i literally love this brush.
This is a hundred percent getting added.
To my regular collection.
Music.
You.
Okay the one major downside to using.
Chalk pastels for your eyeshadow the.
Fall out who for the lid i picked up.
These ultrafine glitters from the cross.
Short now of course you guys know.
Glitter unless it is cosmetic grade it.
Should not be used on the eyes but you.
Know what most of these products.
Probably should not be use of on the eye.
So don't call this advice but i'm gonna.
Pop this gold one right on there i'm.
Literally in love with how this is.
Looking so far like hello this is.
Definitely a good sister i luck so i.
Think i want to add a winged liner i'm.
Getting a real confident clearly but you.
Know what this looks good so i'm gonna.
Grab this ace paint that i got and this.
Is body safe.
Thank god so i'm gonna grab the black.
Shade and do my best to put on a good.
And fresh sister wing liner the sirens.
My eyeball may or may not be burning a.
Little bit right now but you know what.
That's a wing and it's ready to cut.

Adjust away some of this fallout oh.
