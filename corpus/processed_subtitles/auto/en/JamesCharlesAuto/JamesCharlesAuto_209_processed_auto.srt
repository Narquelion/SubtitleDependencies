Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel today.
We're in the studio i made my little.
Sister's a bathrobe available now and.
Sisters esther perel calm and of course.
Is going to be getting ready but for.
Today today i wanted to do something a.
Little bit different if you've been.
Watching my channel for a while it is.
Definitely no secret let's be real hope.
That i had my holy grail beauty products.
That i pretty much use all the time i.
Definitely get a lot of comments about.
It people ask me to use new things and.
I'm not even gonna lie to you guys at.
This point i'm honestly getting a little.
Bit bored too i want to switch it up i.
Want to try out some new things and i.
Figured out a really fun way to do that.
We'll be testing celebrity makeup hacks.
Now so my favorite videos in the entire.
World are the vogue beauty secrets.
Series i'm sure you guys have seen them.
In your recommended feed on your youtube.
Homepage they always pop up for me and i.
Have watched so many them and personally.
I really really love the vogue beauty.
Secrets videos because they're kind of.
Like a fun chill intimate inside look.
Into what the glamour routines of these.
Celebrities look like on an actual.
Everyday basis obviously over the course.
Of their careers they are used to.
Sitting in a glam chair and working with.
Different artists so from doing that.
They obviously pick up a lot of tips and.
Tricks and wealth of knowledge from all.
These artists and it's really cool to.
See it what they picked up and also what.
They've implemented into their daily.
Routines if that really works for them.
So last night i was bench watching a ton.
Of the videos i took notes on a bunch of.
My favorite tips and checks froy they.
Were celebrities i got in my bathrobe i.
Did try to film this video in my.
Bathroom i thought it'd be so much cuter.
But i could not figure out how to get.
The lighting and the camera angle all.
Correct if anybody works at vogue and.
Wants to inform me so we can do a part.
Two to this video please let me know but.
Yeah we're it's gonna get glam and.
Chitchat and if you guys want to see.
Some celebrity at makeup hacks keep on.
Watching.
Music.
All right defense before you even put on.
A stitch of makeup skincare is super.
Super important obviously asda probably.
My favorite video of the entire series.
Is from an 80s supermodel named joan.
Severance i love her video because she.
Is so happy and so upbeat and she talks.
About all different age defying a beauty.
Secrets she just says that she wants to.
Feel beautiful no matter what age she is.
And i am freaking love that as a.
Supermodel clearly she knows good tips.
And techniques and even though i'm only.
20 i would love to look like her when i.
Get older so i'm gonna test out her.
Routine today and she is using a peel.
Off gel mask as her first step.
I'm joan severance and i'm gonna share.
Some beauty secrets of mine with you.
Today this is what you take some of this.
And glops down the throat and look good.
My throat so that's that and now we wait.
For it to dry my skin looks right now oh.
My god i wish it could actually look.
Like this on a daily basis this looks so.
Freaking cool it literally looks like.
Those instagram filters that has like.
The okay then it's lower there's a.
Little bit of bulk filter that has the.
Bogue logo above your head with your.
Skin like this it's meant to be in this.
Vogue video okay that's everything.
Oh yes oh wow this is good big chunk.
This is it that i heard thing that i've.
Ever done.
Oh that looks so nasty wow that was so.
Good i'm gonna quickly wash my face with.
Water to get off any excess and we're.
Gonna move on to the next step all right.
Okay so my next type is just going to be.
Applying some moisturizer and today i'm.
Using the old hendricks in @ci.
Frightening at gel cream i love this one.
And i did a campaign to them a few.
Months ago i'm never losing it her sense.
It isn't bomb health and the next step.
Is going to be from one of my favorite.
Models in the entire world ashley graham.
Now in her video after she puts on her a.
Moisturizer she uses a roller to roll.
Her skin in i'm gonna be honest with you.
Guys i've literally never used one of.
These before in my entire life i think.
Even ashley in her video is like.
Sometimes i wonder why i are rolling my.
Face sometimes i wonder why i'm rolling.
Too but basically it gets the blood.
Flowing throughout your face that helps.
Deep up everything because.
Like a lymphatic massage our state's.
Pains that really really well so i'm.
Just going to go ahead and get deep.
Huffing you know you see all these.
People rolling all the time you wonder.
Why they're rolling sometimes i wonder.
Why i'm rolling too but i know it's for.
The contour it's for the deep huffing.
And my skin nice and tight already best.
Another why skin prep is all done.
Normally next i'd go to the foundation.
But almost literally every single person.
That filmed one of these videos did.
Their eyebrows first which if you know.
Me you would know is not exactly my.
Personal favorite technique i just.
Really like to have my full base on and.
Then put the eyebrows overtop because i.
Feel like it's so hard to just carve.
Them out and just get everything around.
Them but that being said there's no it.
Specific way that you have to do makeup.
So i'm gonna try it for today and we're.
Gonna see how it goes.
Fingers crossed first i start with my.
Brows i never used to be good at brows.
Jordan was always like used to do my.
Brows i conceal right underneath to.
Shape the brow and then i actually hmm.
Well alright okay so the eyebrows are.
Both odd and i would do that there.
Looking like okay i honestly will say i.
Do like how they don't look as like.
Intense and bold because the fact that.
There's no like foundation in powder and.
Everything underneath them so it's.
Really just like my skin and the hair.
Which looks really good but i did have a.
Lot of trouble getting them even without.
Kind of like the rest my face to work.
Off of so i'm not sure maybe i'll.
Practice this technique more in the.
Future but regardless let's go ahead and.
Move on to our next step which is.
Finally going to be our foundation and.
This next tab keeping in the kardashian.
Family is from courtney and she applies.
Her foundation with her hand now this.
Tip may seem a little bit crazy for.
Those of you guys who are like me it's a.
Group with beauty gurus and have beauty.
Blenders and morphe beauty sponges and.
Literally everything in between.
But the reality is is that a lot of.
People use at their hands for their.
Foundation and a lot of celebrity makeup.
Artists swear by using their fingers in.
Their hands because the natural heat of.
The body does a really good job of kind.
Of blending everything in and making it.
Look smooth i don't like doing this.
Because i have a very very weird like.
Phobia of getting makeup on my fingers.
And nails i don't know what it is i.
Literally keep makeup wipes right next.
To me at all times and i clean.
My hands so often i'll do my makeup and.
My little bit crazy or does everybody.
Else do this like i just do not like the.
Feeling of having makeup on my fingers.
And just makes me feel like the process.
Is in a dirty and phimka gross that my.
Nails are good we're gonna do it today.
An honor of sister courtney it might.
Work out but i don't have any complaints.
I'm ready to clean up after i apply this.
With my hands i also do my skin before.
My eyes i think i told kendall about.
This too using my hands first of all was.
Not as nasty as i thought it was going.
To be i just clean it afterwards and i.
Was completely fine at the nails are all.
Good and i did not freak out and i will.
Admit that using my hands that kind of.
Low-key heike made me feel like one of.
Those supermodels that just like rubs.
Everything on and gets clam in five.
Minutes and somehow it looks really chic.
Like it does look very very beautiful.
But sees my fingers took way way longer.
Than it does when you think it's fun so.
Who knows i might use this again in the.
Future and i'm on a time crunch though.
Absolutely not but that being said to.
Each their own and now i decide to move.
On to the next step and that is from.
Taylor hill and normally my next mov.
Concealer but taylor hill likes to use a.
Powder brush and set pretty much her.
Entire face with a little bit of powder.
Before her concealer now as you guys.
Know they're obviously no rules to.
Makeup but kind of one of the more.
Unspoken suggestions is that it's not.
Really great to put creams or liquids.
Overtop of powder because they don't.
Waste much well without being sad if.
It's working for we're gonna test it out.
Today that is the beauty of this video.
So i'm just gonna grab my little setting.
Powder mixture and a fluffy brush and.
I'm just going to lightly set my face.
And please next i'm just gonna use a.
Little bit of powder i put powder all.
Over my face next is concealer sometimes.
I use brushes but for the most part like.
If it's more natural the makeup i like.
To use my hands because i feel like it.
Blends the product better i mean that.
Worked really well cool i am pleasantly.
Surprised with the result of miss taylor.
Hills a technique i think my skin is.
Looking a beautiful to concealer blend.
It out to one.
And i am loving this so far that being.
Said that my face is looking a little.
Bit flat and i am definitely ready to.
Add in some more dimension with some.
Contour today i'm gonna be following it.
Tonight.
Ekos fun fact a few weeks ago on twitter.
I tweeted her thing she was beautiful.
And to your pilot said that i was also.
Beautiful and i was very excited about.
It so i think it's safe to say we're.
Both fans of each other which is kind of.
Everything i'm just gonna grab my normal.
Contouring i'm brush and dip into my.
Narwhal contour shade at least for the.
Cheekbones and forehead portion but i'm.
Gonna go soft kind of to it i like to.
Just follow my natural curves for her.
Contour differentiates on her nose.
Contour instead of tonight doing a.
Superest notched nose like i personally.
Her fur she actually contours like a.
Little ball on the tip of her nose and.
Gives that like that button look which i.
Actually already have i normally try to.
Hide it so let's try it out for my nose.
I like to create like a little button.
No do a little circle at the point at.
The i don't know whatever that's hot.
Then i use my finger and i go right here.
To give it like a cute little all right.
You guys said this next up comes from.
Emily radda radda chomsky right at.
Akatsuki hirata - i don't want to get.
Dried from restaurants in her last name.
Her instagram was amerada she's a.
Beautiful supermodel and this is her.
Five-minute date night look now at.
Emily's video she used a cream a.
Highlighting stick pretty much like all.
Over her face tiff i'm going to be.
Honest i don't think this technique.
Would really work for a lot of people.
Who don't look perfect like her for.
Example media but i'm definitely down to.
Try this out and see what ends up.
Looking like a little bit of highlighter.
I just take the stick a little bit on.
The nose put on my lip.
Into the eye yeah and realizing that my.
Skin looks so pretty i'm not a sweetie.
I'm so sorry that i doubted you even for.
A moment.
Like what first shore going to be using.
This technique in the future i don't.
Think this technique would really work.
Okay so the next time is going to be of.
Course i showed up unfortunately not.
Many of the celebrities actually put on.
Eye shadow looks in their videos which.
Definitely sucks so one trick that a lot.
Of people did use however is using their.
Bronze are in contour to really chisel.
Out of their eyelids which i actually do.
All the time when it comes to my.
Everyday glam so we're going to do that.
Inspired by a kendall jenner i learn a.
Lot from being on set i usually just.
Take my bronzer and do it by phone i may.
Have like a little bit crazy.
Using the brush hair on my eyelid look i.
Am just not used to this whole natural.
Glam type of situation but this does.
Gonna show that using a few different.
Shades of brown can create a really.
Really stunning i look even if it is it.
Very simplistic.
And i think this looks gorgeous we're.
About to move on to our next step which.
Is going to be eyeliner well my favorite.
People of all time elect said to me at.
From a euphoria did her book video and.
She's like taste like my style icon.
Right now and she did a very very.
Beautiful block wing on both the outside.
And inside of her eyes so i'm gonna.
Follow her techniques today so i see.
This pat mcgrath pen i start at the on.
The outer i like a really like pointed.
So i kind of just start like that and.
Then i always get a q-tip and.
Music.
No that is a fail okay this is the first.
Step so far that has been a fail oh it.
Sucks to say what this is the first.
Technique of this video that did.
Absolutely not work for me putting on.
The winged liner it was super easy but i.
Did kind of mess up a little bit and i.
Wanted to follow alexus technique of.
Kind of licking a cotton swab a cotton.
Swab if you are a fast refresh watch i.
Tried it sucking on the q-tip cleaning.
Up eyeliner to fix it all did was just.
Drag the actual ink like everywhere it.
Did not look at it from nation i had to.
Go back and conceal any way to fix it up.
So definitely will not be trying that.
One again regardless alexa looks.
Beautiful i really love this winged.
Liner and the inner corner points i.
Really like this technique and might try.
This more often because it very much.
Gives you that like snatched pull back.
Feline cat table book which i'm done for.
Any day of the week but that being said.
That is pretty much this i look all.
Complete super simple super cute i'm.
Gonna go in and do the mascara and.
Lashes off camera because everyone is.
Pretty much dead regular lashes mascara.
I'll be right back to continue on with.
These tips and tricks so that this point.
The look is pretty much almost complete.
We only have the lips left and it is.
Still looking at so beautiful now before.
I actually gonna put on any lip products.
I want to take one tip from josefina.
Scrubber who's a victoria's secret model.
Huh she's still beautiful and that is to.
Scrub your lips with a tooth brush.
Before actually putting on a lip product.
To exfoliate get rid of any of those.
Disgusting krusty's and also plum i love.
To brush my lips it was always a little.
Bit of a dead skin on them and it makes.
Them swallow a little bit more okay my.
Lips are definitely tingly i don't know.
It's actually being a plunked but this.
Toothbrush is very very like dense so it.
Like definitely did a good job look like.
Roughening up phillips it did do its job.
Of exfoliating it i honestly might.
Continue to use this for me whenever i'm.
Actually doing my makeup routine i.
Always it wait to brush my teeth until.
Right before i do my lipstick so if i am.
Doing my makeup routine next time and i.
Go into the bathroom to wash my teeth.
Before doing lipstick maybe i'll go.
Ahead and brush my lips beforehand kind.
Of fun now for lips i took one more.
Check from ashley graham's video but.
Before she actually goes in with the.
Lips she actually takes a dark brown.
Eyeliner pencil and re like dark and.
Slash shades in her moles to accentuate.
Them which i think is super super cool.
Obviously you guys seen my face without.
Makeup on and i have quite a lot of.
Moles all around so i'm not really sure.
How this is going to.
But i'm gonna try it now i also like to.
Color in there's this like amazing.
Eyeliner and i don't use it on my eyes i.
Use it on my mole i love to color in my.
Malls and make them darker oh no oh no.
This was a just did a bad thing.
This is that's the little dipper oh my.
God it looked so cute when ashley did it.
Why does it look so stupid on me.
First of all i feel like i use a shade.
That was definitely too dark like her.
Looks nice and cute and natural like it.
Still kind of poke into the foundation.
This looks like literal connect the dots.
Like this is not okay i'm gonna cheat.
The system a little bit and grab some.
Test powder and kind of fix this because.
This is bad well not what i will.
Definitely not be doing again i think.
This is a good learning lesson that.
Everything can be okay in moderation and.
This was not moderated i should have.
Used the later brown brow pencil first.
Or i should not have done all of my.
Moles because this just looks billy.
Stupid that being said i think it looks.
Really cute on ashley and i definitely.
Want to try this again be using a better.
Technique and kind of reaccelerating.
Them because i do love my moles never.
Leave before putting on our new lipstick.
Ashley talked about using a brown.
Eyebrow pencil to lightly contour out.
Your lips before putting on a nude.
Lipstick overtop this is my eyebrow.
Pencil that i use for my lips and it.
Just kind of contours your lips they do.
The rest of my finger.
Alright you go ahead with the lipstick.
All odd and contoured things too miss.
Ashley graham i'm just gonna apply a.
Little bit of some setting it's ready to.
Lock this all in place and i think that.
Is this makeup tutorial and using all.
Celebrity and makeup hacks all complete.
