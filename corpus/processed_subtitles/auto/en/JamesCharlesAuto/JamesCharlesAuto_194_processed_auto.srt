Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to our youtube channel.
Today i'm done to the very special guest.
Bae's rug i thought this is a club you.
Never thought you would see coming no me.
Either i know thank you.
First today's video has something very.
Very plagued i obviously am in the.
Beauty community and brian is in the.
Vlogging community but before he was a.
Blogger he was a gamer a full-time.
Gaming a nerd and i just feel like those.
Worlds are two opposites and right now.
We're having likely opposites collide so.
For today's video i'm gonna teach brian.
How to do my makeup and then after that.
He's gonna teach me how to be.
Professional gamer and we're gonna face.
Off in black ops i'm so excited to do.
This.
Me too even though we have virtually.
Nothing in common i think this will.
Probably be really really funny and a.
Definite awesome challenge.
For the two of us to try out each.
Other's the thing that we do best also.
If you guys want to check out the video.
We did on my channel james here turned.
Me into a beautiful drag queen and he.
Did a 10 out of 10 job so if you guys.
Want to see that work come over to my.
Channel and check out the check it out.
It was a great love a good beard and.
Sister alright guys so since part one of.
This video is gonna be teaching at.
Sister brian how to do my full face of.
Makeup.
I clearly already have a full-on look so.
Let's go ahead and take it off and get.
Started with the video let's do it.
Music.
Okay so now a bare face and ready to go.
As you could see my face is looking a.
Little bit bad right now.
I had a facial this morning my sister.
Yoli glow popped all my pimples for me.
Just let you know beauty gurus can have.
Pimples 217 million layers of foundation.
We are definitely far from perfect but.
Without further ado let's go ahead and.
Cover this up please let's do it.
I got you so do you know what the first.
Step of this is going to be foundation.
Yeah really yeah okay there i don't.
Really know what foundation is but is it.
This yeah no way yeah okay see i did.
Learn a thing or two from her.
Yeah i love that we just did a quick.
Sister switcheroo already yeah oh my god.
Okay so you're gonna want to pounce it.
In as opposed to like rubbing it you.
Know like this yeah okay okay that looks.
Better.
Yeah all right all right so you're just.
Talking about how you broke out like.
Extremely bad do you know i'm not bad.
But do you use makeup to like feel more.
Confident about her like just to hide in.
Stuff or yeah i actually wear makeup.
Like as an art makeup for me has never.
Been something as the way to like hide.
Insecurities or anything although i.
Definitely feel like really confident.
And pretty where the full face that.
Makeup off for me i basically just wear.
Makeup like as an art form and to kind.
Of express myself i never really need it.
To like feel pretty but i i mean like.
Definitely some people do yeah as like a.
Straight guy who's like dates girls.
Obviously what is your opinion on like.
When girls wear makeup to me not to.
Sound cheesy at all like girls don't.
Need make-up to express how they look.
But like if it's something like you said.
Like it's an art like if it's something.
That they enjoy doing that of course.
They're gonna do it if anything if.
Anyone is into makeup and passionate.
About it like that just makes them more.
Attractive like their personality true.
It is so true honestly after spending.
The day with you like i've learned so.
Much about makeup and how it's really.
Not only about the looks like i swear.
Like it it it feels like i'm being.
Artistic now yeah it's weird like i love.
It isn't it fun it is you want basically.
All the comes to that are we focus on.
The highlights of your face it's going.
Brightness and attention to the center.
All right perfect.
Music.
Okay so next time is gonna be our powder.
So brian is gonna use the beauty blender.
It is going to dip it in and then he's.
Gonna set first i always start with.
Underneath my eyes okay cuz that's what.
Crease is first okay so i have a.
Question for you yeah you started on.
Youtube i think five and a half years.
Ago now that's a little bit crazy but.
You just turned 21 correct yeah okay so.
Me and brian are really not that far off.
Age wise but you do vlogs correct yeah.
Now there's definitely been some drama.
And the vlogging community of people.
Making a fool of themselves.
I'm not gonna name any names here all.
Right was it strange for you as someone.
Who like shares our entire life.
The internet and obviously i do this as.
Well but to go from being a normal.
Everyday like high school student to all.
Of a sudden being watched by millions of.
People and now considered a role model.
Honestly the transition from like not.
Being anything to becoming something is.
A blessing first cuz like it's it's.
Insane that like this many people.
Actually want to watch my videos wanna.
Like stay updated with my life i never.
Really started to pop off until after.
High school huh but honestly it's crazy.
To me because i have a bunch of my old.
Friends that snapchat me to this day.
Like watching my videos and i'm like.
That's so crazy that like that is weird.
That they stick with my life that like.
Emily we don't really talk that much but.
Like they still like like keep up with.
My day to day life yeah okay so i was.
Doing my sister research on your channel.
And i saw that you joined like i think.
It was two years ago.
Mhm so it was not too long ago mm-hmm.
How has that changed your life it's.
Definitely like a blessing to have so.
Many people like looking up to as like a.
Role model but i think that it's.
Definitely also a really scary thing as.
Well because like we never really knew.
Where we're gonna be like it's exact.
Five years ago you knew you're gonna be.
Like where you are now i felt like when.
I first put on makeup i knew i was gonna.
Sign with carpet girl and yeah blow up.
To where i am not like never in a.
Million years what i haven't imagined so.
It's not like i really started doing.
This to become like a role model yeah so.
What all of sudden millions of people.
Are watching and i feel like you do.
Instantly get that tag as a role model.
There's really nothing you could do to.
Kind of get rid of it we're gonna.
Contour our face using the kat von d.
Shade my palate right now but it's kind.
Of like a really really overwhelming.
Feeling to all the sudden how that many.
People watching and looking up to i feel.
Like it's definitely like scary and you.
Obviously have to like be on your best.
Behavior and not make a really stupid.
Mistakes yeah of course many names yeah.
I mean i myself have made tons and tons.
And tons of mistakes my it's i think.
It's really really awesome to like be a.
Role model for young people and get.
People like watching you looking up to.
You that placement is perfect really.
Okay and then just blend it in so the.
Point of contouring is basically like it.
Adds shadows to the face when you're.
Putting up there on my cheekbones.
Because it's like the very bottom my.
Cheekbone it makes it look like i have.
Like really snatched okay she phones.
Have that makes any sense no it does.
It's looking really good right now.
Laughter i think i'm doing a good job.
What do you guys think i love that.
Confidence yeah it looks pretty good so.
Basically with nose kondo we're gonna be.
Putting.
Uline's on the side of my nose as.
Closely as possible so it looks really.
Really pinched okay does that make sense.
No you don't want to follow the natural.
Shape in the nose that's kind of the.
Whole point you try to fake it oh oh.
Yeah our next one's gonna be to add a.
Little bit of blush before we move on to.
The eyes and this goes on the apples of.
My cheeks the apples like a nice smile.
Like do they look like.
Even definitely have a lot of color.
Going on our next one's gonna be to bake.
Definitely help me out yeah gonna take.
The beauty run with a powder on it right.
I'm gonna go right up against your nose.
Contour so right there all the way down.
And see how that line is perfectly.
Parallel yeah yeah yeah on the other.
Side.
Perfect yeah so while we're baking in.
The oven our next step is going to be.
The eyebrows oh no we're on that level.
Yeah.
Oh hey not the worst i used to at aside.
Without brow no i'm gonna make this one.
Better don't give up on this one.
Always okay watch i can fix it yeah all.
Right all right i got this.
I feel so concentrated it's ridiculous.
I wanna show you how i would do this.
Yeah okay once you get to the tail.
There's clearly like a lot going on over.
Here right now that's okay if you clean.
It up so i'm gonna bring it out and then.
Up top also needs a little bit more.
Definition okay i'm gonna pull this up.
Right here and then bring it down.
So has a nice arch and shape and then.
I'm gonna go right under.
Music.
Oh yeah come up the little miss i made.
Oh that actually looks good interesting.
Wait this one's hard like the eyes are.
Actually harder to do than the face yeah.
Yeah for sure okay so now the brows are.
All complete next up it's going to be.
The eye shadow yes first gonna dip into.
Like a light warren shade us then we.
Called our transition color and that's.
Gonna go right in the eyelid and that.
Like makes everything blend really.
Nicely together okay and i'm gonna dip.
Into a more burnt orange shade and.
That's going to go in the crease again.
But it's gonna keep it more concentrated.
So that's gonna add more dimension.
There's no way i could possibly mess.
This one up you'd be surprised i think.
That same shader i'm gonna pack it on.
Like the outer portion of the lid i.
Don't dip into like this dark brown.
Shade right here and i'm pop that right.
Into the outer area of the violet so.
Right on that outer corner just like.
That see okay i'm gonna grab this.
Shimmery shade up here i'm gonna spritz.
It with a little bit of fix+.
And by adding water to a shimmery shadow.
It makes it more vibrant okay i'm gonna.
Pop that right on the inner corner and.
Hug it right up there that's good yeah.
That actually does that fit and then.
Grab our eyeliner i'm gonna do a winged.
Liner with the one right here uh-huh.
Okay all right so like this i'm gonna.
Take a tiny line think you can recreate.
That on the other eye.
I can probably recreate like all this.
Like the first steps then this part.
Where i have to actually draw it i don't.
Think i'm gonna be able to do that no.
That's true actually i'll make it better.
That's the thought let's do it so you're.
Gonna hold that like this.
That way i kind of went a little bit too.
High okay so you can see that for yeah i.
Could see so in that case you're gonna.
Want to grab a clean brush and just go.
Over that edge to kind of make sure like.
The color is diffused and that'll how we.
Make sure the colors like evenly.
Distribute everywhere.
There aren't many rules to make up it's.
A lot about self-expression but the.
Number one rule that is a rule is you.
Have to blend okay blend blend blend.
Blend blend.
Alright i'll keep that in mind there you.
Go okay so the way you're holding it.
Right now it's bad yeah hahaha since.
You've got a little bit of makeup on the.
Side of the brush if you hold it like.
This.
Not only is it putting it in the crease.
But it's also putting it all up here -.
Because you're rubbing it on so when.
You're applying i should especially when.
You want to make it more defined you.
Want to make sure to hold it that brush.
As parallel as possible so it's really.
Only getting the point.
Right in that crease or even lower so.
Sometimes you can get a little bit on.
The lid but that's okay because you're.
Gonna cover up anyway - okay is this.
Like the the glam one okay so it's it's.
This one right here no that one no.
Music.
You're ready for the winged liner oh man.
My favorite part okay i'm ready for this.
All right i used to take art class in um.
Sixth grade oh i got an f but picasso is.
Shh.
Music.
You ought to end to be as points at as.
You can possibly get i try try let's see.
If you could fix it up that is.
Definitely not fixable oh well she's.
Gonna be really thick so even if you.
Mess up you could just fix it with.
Concealer is that like the concealer is.
Like the go-to of the mix okay like when.
You have a good concealer you're pretty.
Much unstoppable so if i go like this.
Ready i'll take my concealer there's.
Like to make it thinner kinda looks.
Great i think i did a great job on that.
Uh-huh if i have two glasses here these.
Are my all-time favorites i'll there are.
Really lodges in the style.
Miami's and you're gonna glue them on to.
Me today okay all right i got this you.
Basically want to put it right at my.
Eyelashes as close to like the lashline.
As you can get then you want to make.
Sure it's sticking you know happy i get.
One yeah good get that excited yeah when.
I do something right love a good sister.
Eyelash application.
Music.
So while that was on your face they.
Didn't do anything yeah so basically.
Like leaving the powder on there for a.
Little while it kind of brightens.
Everything up so like i was telling you.
How you put the contour to kind of.
Create those shadows yeah.
The baking powder helps intensify the.
Highlights to just further the illusion.
Of like more chiseled features okay okay.
So our next one's gonna be the.
Highlighter this is the one time where.
You do want a lot of product on the.
Brush it off and then you're gonna put.
It right on top of the cheekbone that.
Doesn't seem like something i can mess.
Up but we've said that about everything.
See that glow oh that's nice give it a.
Little world this world huh yeah so good.
Okay okay so i also like to do.
Highlighting on my nose to make my nose.
Look nice and pinched so you want to.
Make sure to draw this smallest line you.
Possibly can right down the center cuz.
That really creates like starting from.
Right here yeah mm-hmm perfect but this.
Is the liquid lipstick meeting goes on.
Obviously a liquid it has this little.
Doe foot applicator we like to call it.
But it dries down a fully mapped like a.
Normal lipstick so you get like a little.
Bit of wiggle room so you're gonna go.
Ahead and apply this on me and i like to.
Over line a little bit only on the top.
Left so basically i go a little bit over.
My natural lip line to make them look.
Nice and juicy.
Okay i got this.
Music.
As you can see i'm not like a good.
Tracer that was something i wasn't good.
At as a kid so staying inside the lines.
Yeah i can tell.
When in doubt when something goes wrong.
Conceal it yeah okay okay so we have one.
Final step which is gonna be to set our.
Face in place so it last through all the.
Sweat blood and tears it's about to go.
Down in our gaming session okay all.
Right.
Quick spritz when you do setting spray.
It's really great to use like a pallet.
Or a fan to kind of fanning the liquid.
Out for the back and that kind of makes.
All the powders and stuff like meld.
Together and look more like skin as.
Opposed to okay a million products just.
Kind of like slightly yeah all right.
Really proud of you really yeah thank.
You literally like you were being so.
Patient the entire time you really were.
Like asking a lot of questions to make.
Sure you're doing the right thing yeah.
If something was wrong you asked me how.
We could fix it and i feel like the.
Finish result came out like pretty good.
Thank you yeah no there's just so much.
That i was interested in like there's so.
Much more to make up than i thought.
There's a lot it's all i was really.
Interested this is like a class yeah.
It's like an art class i feel like when.
Guys are always like getting their girl.
Writing like oh my god babe like why are.
You ready yet we did go this is why.
That's louise okay i don't blame them.

Sucks yeah because like when people say.
Oh that's so gay they really mean to say.
Like oh this sucks you suck like i don't.
Think they need to say in an offensive.
Way but like some people just don't.
Realize what's coming out of their mouth.
But i always remember like trying to be.
In this like gaming world i guess but.
Like always instantly yeah because it's.
Like kind of tough when like people are.
Screaming out gaelic every five seconds.
But there's nothing wrong with being gay.
People just say how the pinger okay i.
Don't realize that like it was actually.
In the fencing now say i just went down.
Again hold on the pro gamer goes down.
Four times you know just kill them for.
Now honestly nine round nine rounds.

Apocalypse being you.
Yeah sesame yeah okay all right sister.
So that is all we have for this.
Challenge today i literally had so much.
Fun today even though like i said.
Earlier me and bryan don't really have a.
Lot in common i think it was so cool to.
Kind of like trade places and see into.
The other person's like industry and.
What they really really loved to do we.
Were definitely brought together by a.
Strange instagram live occurrence but.
I'm say never in a million years did i.
Think i'd be into makeup like that yeah.
And like after today i kind of want to.
Actually go home and try to do my mom's.
Makeup i think years old i don't really.
How devoted you were to it like you.
Really cared you took your time with.
Like thought was so cool it really is.
Like an art like yeah it's it's not just.
Makeup like you throw on makeup it's.
Like precision and like creativity.
Yeah it's stuff like that so like i.
Actually enjoyed it yeah and i never in.
A million years expected to like be.
Playing freaking black ops or a.
Professional gamer but without one we.
Killed it we got so far.
And it was really awesome to kind of.
Participate in a world that i was once.
Literally horrified out because of some.
Like the nasty comments and stuff but.
You do have to understand that like.
These are really really young kids yeah.
Are educated and exactly fingers crossed.
They will find their cost and they.
Definitely what they're saying is.
Offensive sometimes but there's people.
Like you who are like leading a.
Community of people especially young.
Kids as well and you like teach them.
Right from wrong and that that's super.
Super awkward if you guys enjoyed.
