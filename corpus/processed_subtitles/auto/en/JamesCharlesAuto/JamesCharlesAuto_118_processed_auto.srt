Hi sisters james charles here and.
Welcome back to my youtube channel oh my.
God you guys for today's video i have.
Actually really really excited and i.
Just wanted to write in because today's.
Video is literally one of the most.
Requested comments from you guys.
Probably ever in the history of this.
Channel and i think i know why -.
Obviously you guys know i'd love to play.
With makeup and it's my hobby and now.
Thanks to all you scissors it is my job.
And i get to do it every single day but.
I probably never would have fell into my.
Love for makeup had it not stem from my.
Love for art a few years ago when i was.
Younger i would come home from school.
Every single day and spend hours and.
Hours of my time trying portrait with.
Charcoal or pencils sketching in my.
School notebooks or on my homework.
Drawing different painting and.
Scrapbooking literally you name it and i.
Was definitely trying to be a creative.
In some way shape or form the toilet of.
My palette that it's not really so.
Obviously is unleash your inner artist.
Which i feel like has definitely.
It and my makeup stylist as well at this.
Point you name it i pretty much painted.
Every single day on my face at this.
Point everything from skeletons and 3d.
Special effects for halloween time tori.
What is't dripping down my skin - even.
At the aurora borealis literally stocked.
Up right here on my forehead and that.
Brings me into today's brand new video.
My love for art has definitely made a.
Very large impact on my life and.
Somebody also has an intense love for.
Art is bob ross if you know who bob ross.
Says he's an icon and a legend or ep.
Gone way too soon but he truly changed.
The art industry because of the fact.
That he would go on tv for like 30.
Minutes segments and create a beautiful.
Landscape painting but what was.
Different about it as they who's.
Actually taking the audience through the.
Painting step by step almost like a.
Regular tutorial if you really kind of.
Think about it bob ross was kind of like.
The first-ever guru before being a guru.
Even really existed and he had an.
Immense love and talent for painting but.
To most everyday people painting is very.
Very challenging and he brought his.
Knowledge and his skills on a public.
Platform which at the time was tv and.
Share that with the world and help.
People at home learn how to be better.
Painters just like i kind of do with.
Makeup every single day so for today's.
Video after literally thousands and.
Thousands of you guys commenting and.
Asking for this i thought i would.
Finally give it a go and try following a.
Raus painting tutorial on my face super.

I'm going through the bob ross youtube.
Channel i really wanted to do something.
Like very wintry because tis the season.
And i found that this wine which is.
Called a bob ross reflections of calm.
Season 31 episode 1 originally aired on.
February at 22nd 1994 literally before i.
Was even born so let's see what bob's.
Gonna have us paint today.
Music.
Oh that's so mr. ross i was in say my.
Lawyers gonna need to talk to him but.
This was filmed over 20 years ago the.
Whole paintbrush idea hello my intro.
Uglisha in the artist that entire.
Campaign wow.
Maybe his lawyer though should be.
Calling mine hello i'm bob ross and i'd.
Like to welcome you to series 31 of the.
Joy of paint he's so paul first time.
With us allow me to extend a personal.
Invitation for you dragged out your.
Crates and your brushes and paint on.
With the seats he'll tell you but let's.
Start right off today they haven't run.
All the colors across the screen that.
You need titanium white while they're.
Doing that let me show you what i get.
Done up here hello blue today i'm using.
An 18 by 20 process with this it's pre.
Strict and double primed and then i've.
Just covered the entire canvas with a.
Very thin coat of liquid white okay so.
Possibly painting on a canvas i'm gonna.
Be painting on my forehead and equally.
As large surface a few months ago off my.
Instagram i did an aurora borealis like.
Where i basically painted like the.
Entire aurora borealis and like a winter.
Scene on my forehead and then i didn't i.
Look inspired by it and i really really.
Loved how it turned out so i think first.
Two days did it i want to do it the same.
Thing to kind of keep the painting up.
Here and maybe even do an eye look using.
The pallet after the sock just like a.
Little bonus tutorial moment i have my.
Colors picked out right here on biddy's.
Makeup rubber flash palette and my.
Canvas is already primed with foundation.
And lots of powder and concealer tell.
You what let's turn up day with a little.
Two-inch brush okay you think i need a.
Two-inch brush should i be using like.
Paint brushes for this i didn't prepare.
Okay suppose it looks like it's like a.
Light blue so i'm gonna take that's not.
Gonna mix together some blues this could.
Use my hand as a palette because i don't.
Have a fancy bob ross actual pala that's.
Like a good phthalo blue right there.
Criss-cross strokes that easy and easy.
All the way across the canvas.
And work down by the way the paint is.
Continually mixing as a liquid white.
That's already on the canvas and.
Automatically your sky will get lighter.
And lighter as you work down toward the.
Horizon oh are you kidding me there let.
The canvas work for you how the colors.
In the paint he this is an entire sky in.
Literally one minute is this a prank i'm.
Using my crisscross techniques and.
Really just criss crossing that for a.
Real one i wish i had a two inch brush i.
Feel like that really helped me out here.
Gonna really get this into the hairline.
Because we got to go all the height to.
The top of the canvas he said as you go.
Down they'll be less and less product i.
Don't like how do i just crisscross.
Crisscross crisscross lots of wintertime.
Sky if i ever did to myself we're just.
Gonna move on but i suggest more than.
The outside unison if everything works.
Just right it looked like a shrimpy of.
Lights just freakin right across your.
Water speaking it works great thank you.
It's guy me in the beauty industry i.
Guess i'm gonna have some more of my.
Blue color i'm gonna pull it in from the.
Side like he said to keep your brush.
Straight but i'm working on a not.
Exactly flat canvas here so this is a.
Little boobs i just did what he said not.
To do okay i'm already not following the.
Story i'll pull inwards sorry bob.
There's my eyebrow i think my water is.
Up too high right now i want a dark in.
The corners on this i'm gonna take a.
Little pressure depression glue is much.
Much stronger than phthalo blue god it's.
A beautiful blue.
In the corners i'm just gonna have a.
Small amount of depression oh i love.
Okay great we finally get to add some.
Forehead contour this i have definitely.
Downpour i'm gonna grab a little bit of.
Blue and maybe a little bit of black.
Even two to really deepen that up and.
Make it look like my forehead is that.
Eight hundred miles long when the.
Painting is completely done these dark.
Corners will help lead the eye toward.
The center of the painting come up a.
Little in the water - we don't want it.
Left out okay just blend that cover till.
It's nice and smooth.
I don't understand how he's doing it so.
Fast and so he's done like three paint.
Rok's and there's a there's the entire.
Ocean like a what hello no it's not no.
It's not yeah is it yes is it really.
People be like james but back heck you.
Just did an entire snowflake in one.
Second on your face this is true i think.
If i'd had a campus like this one be as.
Difficult i feel like it i really set.
Myself up for failure here doing this on.
My own forehead adding some dimension to.
The ocean like bobby said oh my god my.
Hair why did i let you guys talk me into.
That it's like are you serious oh my god.
I'm gonna rip all my hair out this looks.
He has it literally um like i can see.
That the sky in the ocean on his already.
And the mine like what is this i think.
We should just keep going let's you know.
Let me be positive everything why.
Stern's all gonna be on so this is where.
I really had a good time it's cleaning.
This little brush shake it off really is.
The fun part this whole technique i'm.
Just gonna clean my brush you think i'm.
Makeup wipe but i do love beating the.
Devil out of certain things today let's.
Take crimson a little bit of black i.
Want to make up a little mountain in.
Here i want to make a a dark we'll have.
Endure like in color that's most.
Important how you load the knife take.
Cut across the paint and get a little.
Rule that lives right over the edge of.
The knife okay let's go up in here right.
Here just decide where you think.
Little mountain who lives in your world.
And drop dead painting is a very.
Individual effect we all see nature.
Through different eyes and that's the.
Way you should paint it all we're.
Looking for is the nice top edge we.
Could care less what's happening down.
Below our brush is good and dry a couple.
Liquid whites on the canvas you can.
Literally move color if you were working.
On a drag canvas right now you'd be an.
Agony city that's a mountain you just be.
The mountain and literally 30 seconds i.
Can't put like a knife on my face so i.
Guess i'm just gonna use like a flat.
Square brush which is like i mean sort.
Of as close i'm gonna get it right like.
I don't know what else i would use well.
No i think my water my oceans too tall i.
Don't have room to move out in anywhere.
Well now i have a blue forehead so what.
Am i gonna do now okay he literally just.
Like took the brush and like like what.
Honey he just like a little scrape down.
There are you kidding me go back to the.
Solid dark color and come right up in.
Here that's oh no hold on sweetie i'm.
Gonna need your paws oh my god here we.
Go another mountain okay so this one he.
Said he wanted to be more crimson than.
Blue so i'm gonna take some red and mix.
It together here.
Always remember if you can see the.
Entire mountain it's always more.
Distinct on the top but it is on the.
Bottom.
Okay gus had missed and now we have.
Wonderful solution lays around a lot.
Across getting political okay so we okay.
So when it comes like the bottom of.
These rods he living stinking living.
Blends it away okay i need to pause it's.
Not good for this video he takes a dry.
Brush after that and just like goes in.
And just like but lends it away how i.
Don't really know but we're gonna we.
Include me to figure it out yeah okay.
This is not that bad like it's no bob.
Roth is for sure but it's not bad it's.
Fun to take and reflect a mountain right.
Into the water.
Oh god now we're just looking for a.
Basic little recollection here exact we.
First start is easier to take the canvas.
Off your easel and turn it upside down i.
Just basically repaint them just like we.
Did howard's also draw the same mountain.
Again look i don't even know what i did.
The first time.
Are you kidding me i'm so focused right.
Now it's not even funny i want to make.
This like actually good like i don't i.
Don't i can't flop okay that's not that.
Bad oh my god you're kidding yeah now.
We're gonna blend it out just like bob.
Sad blend it upward so it's like a.
Little reflection in the water.
Music.
As possible.
We'll have thick and firm response the.
Walls to go take a little white flag.
Little you know oh my god you had this.
Has got to be jose.
Oh my god hey look first her is applying.
Too much pressure like he literally just.
Like ran the paintbrush over the area.
With like with a little bit of white and.
They're all sons of mountain range i.
Think this is so sick though because you.
Guys know that i always loved art but.
What i was really really good at was.
Drawing portraits with like pencil and.
Charcoal i still liked painting but i.
Really wasn't that great at it.
So like learning these techniques is and.
Same because i never in a million years.
Would have tried this stuff but it's.
Like not as hard as i would have thought.
Making some gray on the back of my hand.
I don't really know how to do this.
Exactly i mean not horrible honestly it.
Could be a lot better but like could be.
A lot worse gonna touch up some areas.
Where i'm like having a little bit of.
Trouble here so when i do my aurora.
Borealis like a few months ago i.
Actually did do winter mountains in the.
Photo and they were white as opposed to.
Like a shadow and that one like we're.
Doing right now if you zoom it on the.
Photo there's like a lot of dimension in.
Detail in the mountains and i will say.
I'm pretty proud of how they ended up.
Looking if like it did look pretty real.
That's because i spent literally an hour.
Going in and drawing tiny little black.
Lines and dots to symbolize like.
And shadows and the mountains what all i.
Had to do was scrape it on there with a.
Knife we'll just take it's a mountain.
Killer same amount covering sort of a.
Lavender would tap a little bit right.
Into that two-inch brush don't be afraid.
Of this brush because it's large it'll.
Do wonderful things.
Let's to say i don't don't be afraid to.
This brush because it's large it'll do.
Wonderful things that it's my model in.
Life just not for brushes let's have.
Some fun some blue and some black put.
Some brown in it add some green what.
Yeah basically all your dark colors.
There's one number six fan brush little.
Fan brushes are you kidding just put a.
Little bit of color right on the brush.
It's all there is to it.
Gross fan versus living - nothing.
There's literally no plant fan brushes.
They're the dumbest brush little trees.
Little closer to this but living very.
Far away suddenly i need a fan brush to.
Make this little grass he had like a.
Gotha we pull this up he had like a.
Green and like some dark mess okay we're.
Gonna put that like over here.
I'm gonna use like a little liner brush.
Maybe i got some more dimension oh.
That's the shoreline this is crazy like.
Oh my god are you serious so a little.
Bit of white and i notice how he when he.
Was like playing around with the colors.
He like kind of like let them be messy.
So almost when he puts them on they're.
Like it kept some of that dimension.
Maybe that's the technique that i'm.
Messing up a little bit is that like i'm.
Trying too hard to make it look perfect.
That doesn't exactly work i think it's.
Totally a lot more than just that.
Technique that i'm messing up just.
Cut in a little water line if you put a.
Little too much liquid white on there.
And you think it's a little too strong.
Just rub it it will just be absorbed.
Into the color it'll go away he's such a.
Good teacher that's what i will say too.
Is like everything that he's doing he.
Makes it look so easy.
But you actually get to watch him and do.
The entire thing i suppose that i'm just.
Like cutting to the finished product.
He's a little bit away to sketch in a.
Water line i mean honestly like not.
Horrible.
Like not great but still not horrible we.
Need to figure out hope we're gonna put.
In here so let's take some pression blue.
Set green crimson brown here's old.
Two-inch brush we'll take him let's just.
Block in some areas we're gonna have a.
Big tree that lives right here this is.
Sort of your bravery test after you.
Worked so hard to put in all those.
Gorgeous things when you come up here.
Some crazy fuzzy haired guy says we did.
A big tree right over the top of air and.
I already listed a tree once again he.
Just painted it an entire tree in 30.
Seconds so i have my little two-inch.
Brush i'm gonna put that over here cuz.
This is where the tree should go oh so.
Now we've had a wall because um that's.
Not a tree and anyways like not even.
Close to like everything else is like.
Okay this is like bob like that's a blob.
Of paint i don't know how he did that i.
Doesn't take advantage of what happens.
We call those accidents and they can be.
Your best friend.
Oh my literal god he isn't because right.
Going down there those are trees and.
Those are trees in the reflection.
You're kidding huh oh my god this is too.
Challenging for me i also set myself up.
For failure i doing this on my own face.
But let's put some freakin trees in here.
What are you kidding.
How does he do that i mean it could be.
Worse maybe if i use like a little bit.
Like more of like a fluffy brush as.
Opposed like a pencil brush like this.
Will work cause it.
Like all that texture no that did not do.
Anything maybe something like this it's.
Like a literally like a rough that.
Actually literally hurts yes this is a.
Horse right underneath that we need a.
Reflection is the treatments right here.
We'll put some highlight i'm so sure.
This one lives a little closer to us so.
We can make out a little more oh my god.
That's an entire poetry oh my god no.
Okay so no oh he put a tree like right.
Here-ish i'm just like stifling this on.
For a real one i'm hoping that it looks.
Good.
That looks so dumb are you kidding me.
How did he do that no i'm annoyed.
Because they actually wanted this to.
Look good and it's not looking a good or.
Frosch there's your freaking pine trees.
In the forefront bob what the oh i don't.
Understand how he does this so quickly.
That'll snatch it right up are you.
Kidding bob ross is not a superstar.
Beauty guru wow bob lois is really.
Coming from prayin today mixing together.
Green and yellow on the back of the hand.
The little palette here i really thought.
I was gonna be okay at this i am not.
Realizing that these trees are forming a.
Separate island to overlap the water and.
I did not get that memo before oh no.
Like bob said you know we get to choose.
Where we want to put our things in our.
World so these trees are going in front.
They're loving their grass area right.
Here taking this into my own hands for a.
Second you know we're just putting the.
Grass right here we're dragging that.
Brush upwards to create the appearance.
Of grass just like bob said bob sweetie.
I am so sorry it just looks like he's.
Like painting maybe bob ross has mother.
Nature conspiracy theory he just paints.
It in there.
Well now i feel stupid i messed us all.
Treat lives okay back to the victory.
Craze that's the beauty of pain yes you.
Really don't have to know exactly where.
Everything's at we thomas works trust me.
I know okay so i'm gonna go back to this.
And i'm gonna hide away my mistakes by.
Using lots of dark colors and making.
This tree a little bit more tree like so.
Let's make this a tree and it goes all.
The way down just like bob said that is.
The worst of all time are you kidding me.
Music.
Music.
You can put this right on here oh my god.
Are you love me just okay so i think.
Before we move on to the next step i.
Want to pause for a second actually move.
Away from the tutorial and fix a mistake.
That i made early on which was putting.
The lighter mountain-like on the edge as.
Opposed to in the middle so we have this.
Like kind of entire area on my forehead.
A completely blank so i think i want to.
Try to do another big tree over here.
Since i butchered this one so badly just.
To one fix it a little bit and make it a.
More composed to painting but also to it.
To get a little more practice then so if.
I put it like over here just like.
Sketching in i was like little thing.
With my number two brush that looks.
Literally already a million times better.
Than the first one okay love that love.
Me making progress next we added a.
Little bit of green landscape so i'm.
Gonna do that as well over here just.
Sketching it in not really caring.
Because it's our world and we get to.
Place the greenery wherever we want it.
To be so i'm just gonna put it right.
Here kind of right underneath my eyebrow.
Sucks gonna take a little bit of that.
Landscape and we're just gonna blend it.
Downwards oh there's some on this side.
Too so taking some more yellow and green.
For some dimension gonna stipple it.
Right on here ah slightly too yellow no.
Worries though.
It's gonna take our 2 inch brush and.
Just dump right over top of that just.
Blend it away we have the liquid white.
Underneath so no worries i forgot to add.
In my tree trunk with a little bit of.
Brown and a little bit of titanium white.
Before adding in the details let's do.
That now.
Can't blame us let my mind know maybe a.
Little bit of white perhaps it's a birch.
Tree we get to choose it's our world.
Never gonna go back in and add some more.
Dimension discovering our little bit of.
Green and a little bit of yellow mixing.
It together on the palate just stifling.
It right on there.
Oh my god that's a tree i feel ready to.
Add some more like dimension into my.
Grass i feel like my grass is looking.
Slightly flat so i'm gonna grab some.
Yellow and some green just like the.
Trees and just go in and just like.
Slightly sniffle just like he said and.
Then lift it right up words just right.
Now that creates the illusion of grass.
And that in the foreground of the.
Painting i'm acting like i know exactly.
What i know but really they have no idea.
Great part of the tutorial i want to.
Show you an easy way of making a.
Fantastic effect one side only i'll put.
In the light color so you get dark light.
Now watch it watch a little stone biz.
Right there and wherever you want these.
Are you just drop them in several little.
Stones put some little grass seed things.
It brings it all together he makes it.
Look so easy oh my gosh it would put.
Just the indication of a little water.
Line here they're sort of bring it all.
Together.
Music.
I really hope you've enjoyed this i hope.
You'll join us for no television series.
From all of us here i'd like to wish you.
Happy painting.
God bless my friend oh i guess we're.
Done.
It was literally almost as if he was.
Like throwing the paint on the canvas.
And it was just like working what's the.
Same that i've talked about my videos a.
Lot of times that like you shouldn't do.
As an artist because it doesn't work.
That way but like bob ross like is.
Magical and it is working totally for me.
It isn't so much just happened i mean we.
Literally painted an entire mountain end.
Of like forest landscape on my freaking.
Forehead my hands palette as you can.
Tell it's covered with every color you.
Could possibly imagine and i really hope.
You help us look turned out just as fun.
I thought i'd clean up this palette.
Super quickly and take out my palette.
And do a super quick and easy bob ross.
Inspired i look just to kind of pull the.
Whole face together let's get started.
Again i'm gonna prime my eyelids as.
Always using my morphe tab but one seven.
Three brush on my mac painterly.
Paint-pot.
Grabby gonna add about four five six i'm.
Gonna dip into the shade of the dark.
Matte green and pack this in an outer v.
Shape and then with any excess i'm just.
Bringing that shade right into the.
Crease and then having a 10.33 are gonna.
Dip into a social blade in the bottom.
Left hand corner and use that to buff.
Out the edges first pocket light color.
On there and then just using light.
Circular motions to diffuse not that.
Edge i pack a little bit of daddy into.
That outer corner mixing together a tiny.
Little bit of dotty and a little bit of.
Tea on a tan 506 as well i'm just gonna.
Use this to deepen off the outer v.
Grabbing a little bit of concealer and.
An m12 four brush i'm going to quickly.
Cut the crease now on another i want to.
For brush i'm gonna dip into the shader.
Wah i'm gonna give it a quick spritz of.
Some setting spray and i'm gonna pop.
This shade right in the middle of the.
Crease and then just like always with.
That either access shadow that's left on.
The brush i'm just going to blend in.
That edge so there's no harsh line on.
That concrete with that same brush i'm.
Gonna grab a little bit of ring light.
And give that a sprint up some setting.
Spray as well and we're gonna pop that.
In the inner corner and overlap it right.
Over top that guac to make kind of like.
An ombre metallic shade dipping into a.
Tiny bit of it be and i'm gonna pal.
In the inner corner gotta highlight my.
Inner corners with the yellow just like.
Bob ross dead with his trees for the.
Lower lofts i'm gonna grab a little bit.
Of a cola and pack this right up against.
The lash line oh good it's happen to.
Both the playground and a little bit of.
Brother to kind of make a more phthalo.
Blue type of mixture if you will and use.
That to buff out a little bit of cola.
And finally to finish off the side like.
I'm just gonna grab the next vivid.
Bright light yellow liner and use this.
To cut the crease gonna quickly curl my.
Lashes and pop on a little bit of mac.
Extended play mascara and then finally.
Popping on it lily lost in the style so.
Extra miami i almost forgot lots of.
Family at least in a girl banana 4 3 1.
And dip into a face a highlighter shade.
In the palette and use this to highlight.
The brow bone.
All right scissors and that is how you.
Guys can create this super simple bob.
Ross and start i add makeup look i.
Wonder if you guys at home watching out.
We're like oh my god how did he even do.
That does the guy was at watching bob's.
Israel earlier on i'm gonna go and.
Finish it all right off camera quickly.
And i'll be right back with the final.
Look and my thoughts oh i thought i.
Threw the other eye off camera quickly.
Somehow that i using the chain of face.
For my palette of course and a brown.
Tone of liquid lipstick just took math.
With like the whole tree vibe and you.
Guys i think that is this a bob ross.
Makeup tutorial all complete you guys i.
Had so much fun from with this video.
Today oh my god i almost bought myself.
That i waited this long to do it but.
Like i said at the beginning of this.
Video i've always loved art and had such.
A passion for it but painting was never.
Something that i was really thought.
Creina.
And for my videos and i am definitely a.
Perfectionist so i was super nervous.
Right into this today but following the.
Bob ross tutorial made it so much easier.
Than i would have expected he was so.
Calm and so sweet and slow which is.
Really great for beginners like me and.
Also i was really only shook at first.
Because he was doing so many different.
Little tips and techniques that made the.
Painting come together so fast i was.
Like literally watching magic infront of.
Your very eyes but actually watching him.
Doing it and explained how the different.
Techniques work made it easy for me to.
Try to recreate it as well it is very.
Obvious to me why so many people loved.
And watch bob ross not only were his.
Paintings literally iconic he is so.
Credibly talented but also as well he is.
Generally just such a great teacher he.
Explained everything so so well and you.
