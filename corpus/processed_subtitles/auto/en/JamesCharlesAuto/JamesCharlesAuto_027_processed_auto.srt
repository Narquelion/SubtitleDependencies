Entire season sister and we're back a.
Few cleaner tito hope you miss us if we.
Best you guys we've been gone for a.
Pretty long time oh and i promise it's.
For a good reason i've been working on a.
Lot of really huge projects on the dl.
What'd you find out about eventually and.
Ian has been in school it's not good nor.
For us but guess what it's summer ian is.
Leaving school hopefully fingers crossed.
And now i am more free so that's good.
And fresh that was so annoying no one.
Else is annoying you is going to be on.
Scoop dd whoop i get annoyed so easily.
By the littlest things i want to talk.
About them and hopefully you guys will.
All share the same annoyances probably.
Not honestly yeah probably not but my.
Pet peeves you being gonna oh one of my.
Biggest pet peeve is immaturity i hate.
When people don't act age if they should.
Like james that is literally it so far.
Every single kid set as my age literally.
Is in college failing all other classes.
And partying every night getting crunk.
And i'm here running an empire.
You hang out a little bit the most.
Immature people ever hey.
Stop throwing shade and they're all.
Immature you're yo that is such a lie.
Your friend group is literally the.
Definition of immature you literally.
Went to a sauna a few weeks ago and were.
00 in the morning.
Farting in the sauna with your friends.
It was funny it's not funny that is.
Pretty funny some older lady wanted to.
Just enjoy her time in the sauna and you.
Guys weren't sitting there farting and.
Snapchat she probably wanted to dog she.
Probably did die assumes that's also one.
Of my pet peeves you like to talk a lot.
You don't talk enough so i would rather.
Not talk and then have you talked the.
Whole time tell him to shut up.
All the comment for that first few.
Episodes royce oh my god this is only.
The james show of you making your time.
Man no smells good.
Well maybe you should open person oh.
She's changed her transformation in.
School people that don't feel like.
Paying attention as i could talk and.
Like mess with the teacher not annoy me.
I think that is you in school though i.
Don't talk in school man every single.
Class has had my headphones in and like.
Slept the whole time.
Oh we're one of those kids i cannot send.
People are like disrespectful and.
Obnoxious and loud in public immature is.
A weird topic to like talk about but i.
Think like everyone is annoyed that.
Can't really bring ideas to it you know.
What i mean.
Maturity is an epidemic this is not a.
Psa thank you for coming to our ted talk.
I also remind off with a bang let me.
Tell you i like when things go my whack.
And not in like the business we're all.
Not like video uploads not in like karma.
I like when things happen how they're.
Supposed to happen sometimes when those.
Things don't happen how they're supposed.
To happen a rush of anger goes through.
My body like no other.
Listen like when you're coming home.
After very long time.
Right and you take off your shoes using.
One but to kick it off and then you have.
One shoe left on one foot and you try to.
Take it off and the shoe doesn't come.
Off by the way literally makes me want.
To scream i don't know why oh when.
You're putting on shoes like you step on.
The back and they get stuck and you.
Can't pull it off when it hurts your.
Finger annoying oh this it goes along.
With this - i have a hair dryer in my.
Bathroom it was a $400 hair dryer which.
Blows my mind literally why it does do a.
Good job i will say a prayer to god this.
Hair dryers cord is literally like the.
Strongest being i've ever encountered in.
My entire life how can a poor be strong.
Across literally let me tell you this.
Cord is plugged into my wall okay and i.
Have a pretty small bathroom sink and.
For some reason whenever i move the.
Hairdryer to start using it first yes.
That is exactly the issue and i don't.
Know why it is one of those things were.
For some reason this cord was made so.
Strong that whenever i pick it up to use.
It the second it even moves everything.
Comes off the counter with it why it.
Wasn't made that way who made a cord not.
These sound like the dumbest issues ever.
But they really just get me so angry all.
I want to do is do my hair i don't wanna.
Sit there and have to pick up every.
Single thing off my bathroom floor.
We'll use and what about you well yeah i.
Just leave it there because it gets me.
So angry.
Every time i do i heard my heavy i.
Usually always scream in some way.
Just move your hairdryer to a different.
Place i don't think there's any other.
Plugs in that bathroom put it in the.
Living room with a big mirror and you.
Got a bunch room for activities what i.
Don't have to walk out of my bathroom to.
Go to the living room to do my hair.
That's like inconvenient practical.
Instead of knocking everything over i.
Guess that is true he's known as.
Personal problems that you can fix very.
Easily this is just like a subcategory.
Of pet peeves it's just a bunch of.
Umbrella things that all just make you.
So mad how do you not even understand.
This cuz they're personal problems yes.
What fixes don't you have these little.
Things that like that they don't exactly.
Work right away it just makes you so oh.
Oh my phone doesn't charge like when the.
Chargers in there yes yes i'm a computer.
Desk i have these like charging ports.
That i use and you kind of stick your.
Phone on there my iphone is so old and.
Crosses the charger never works like i.
Literally have to sit there and shove it.
On there like eight times until it.
Actually registers that it's charging.
That is another one of those things that.
I get so when you kick butt you can't.
Find a tv remote in your bed covers yeah.
And then you shuffle your bed sheets.
Then you're claustrophobic get right.
Back to the get a lovino it with james's.
Arrived difinitely notice how many you.
Scissors actually recognized us in.
Public and i think i got really good at.
Talking you guys you meet you guys but.
There's a few things that tend to get on.
My nerves.
Oh fan pet peeves oh risky topic people.
In public probably my favorite aspect of.
This entire job is to get to thank the.
People face-to-face citizens including.
Me at sensei juan truly such a cool.
Experience that is like just rolling her.
Every time there are however some.
Situations where it is so not cool one.
Of them being when i'm eating dinner oh.
My god.
Just wait like ten minutes.
So rude and everytime happens i'm like.
Nice to meet you too and it's usually.
Not the kids either it's the parents who.
Will come up to the table with their.
Kids and drilling behind them and say.
Hello james.
Oh my god would you mind if i daughter's.
Get a picture of you i'd always say of.
Course as soon as i'm done eating dinner.
With steak and french fries stuffed in.
My mouth about to scarf down a coat i.
Owe my god i just thought you looks half.
I literally i'm getting angry just.
Thinking about this do you know what my.
Biggest pet peeve is and this is dealing.
With parents of my god let me i'm.
Getting this gets me so mad.
Okay let me tell you a parent will come.
Up and the sentence will be somewhere.
Along the lines of this.
Hi are you are you like james and i'll.
Say.
No i'll say yes i am how are you and.
They'll say i have no idea who you are.
And i don't know what you do and i don't.
Know why my kids want a photo with you.
But they seem to know who you are so.
Would you mind taking a picture with my.
Daughters.
Excuse me jay-j hi jane.
James hi hi james nice to meet you my.
Kids won't take a picture with you jamie.
I don't know i don't really know who you.
Are or what you do or what i want to.
Take a picture with you i'm a youtuber.
Actually i do makeup.
Oh johnny that that's cool.
Yeah can my kids take a picture with you.
Yeah i'd love to.
I really don't know why they want to or.
Who you are yeah i got it.
Shelley shelley come on thanks again.
Gents i still don't know why they took a.
Picture with you but um what's your.
Facebook so i can check it out later i.
Would absolutely love but to take a.
Photo with you but if you are too.
Nervous and if you send your parrot over.
Please give them a brief synopsis of who.
You'll be taking a photo with so one i.
Don't feel really uncomfortable having.
To explain to them what i'm doing.
Because that's weird that makes me feel.
Very very egotistical and that it's not.
Font so let's stop doing that please and.
Thank you.
Oh usually meanie fans in person is a.
Great expense but there is one thing.
Online that really okay what is that so.
You know those like voting things where.
They get like six of us so it'd be like.
Me you the dolan yeah like vote who you.
Would want out first what they're so i.
Don't like them either what is the point.
Of that first of all second of all get.
Really angry when i get voted out it.
I've never won one me i mean i will.
Admit at dusk it's annoying.
It does feel pretty guy when you're.
Looking at one and you like see yourself.
Make it to the next round kind of i'm.
Not gonna lie yeah but it's at the same.
Point but then when you get voted out it.
Really one of my biggest pet peeves.
Probably the top pet peeve to me is when.
People think money buys fashion like.
When people spend thousands of dollars.
On clothes by having no idea how to wear.
It you know what i mean like don't get.
Like don't get like $2,000 gucci pants i.
Like red and blue and they get like a.
Supreme shirt that's yellow and black.
But this coat a hundred dollars i think.
It works well and it doesn't ever no.
You're right just because they sent a.
Thousand dollars at a luxury store does.
Not mean it's gonna look good in fact.
It's usually gonna look bad there's.
Things that really had a mass cuz.
There's just one certain youtuber not.
Gonna name any names.
Um just because you wear a lot of.
Expensive items they're not gonna go.
Well together for not the same color or.
Not the same like style at all so fix.
That if you were watching.
I just don't like that was the worst.
Call-out ever that's going from you.
Someone who literally cannot match an.
Alpha to save their life this is only.
The most first real problem issue i will.
Ever talk about on social media but.
Seriously that really gets me good gal.
My job is very immobilize imac but i.
Also have a laptop an ipad and an iphone.
They're all connected okay they're all.
Connected through my icloud and the.
Whole point of icloud is to sync all of.
Your devices together why is it but it's.
Not how it works no you you would think.
But of course you nothing ever goes how.
You wanted to go if you walked in this.
Ear welcome for this you can descend me.
A check later how much that work is that.
If i am working on my imac for several.
Hours then i click save which you do.
Every single time and you put your imac.
To sleep if i open my laptop and they're.
All connected it should be the same.
Exact act like why is it not that way.
How about you desired that mr.
Smartypants probably well obviously.
Probably won't know probably well.
Somebody else needs to do that okay.
That's just how it should work.
Thanks for listening oh okay.
This pet peeve is about you ah yeah okay.
So you'll be on your phone or on your.
Computer correct.
Thank you i'll ask you a simple question.
Like what do you want for dinner.
Yes you won't answer for like five.
Minutes and you're like wait what no.
That's not true.
I always here and then i still answer.
You but i answer it five minutes late.
When 10 minutes later you look at your.
Exit or you ordered food but don't be.
Ungrateful you saw your answer at least.
Keep but it's like james what time is.
30.
What that you still get your answer well.
I don't understand what the issue is.
Because i need to know these answers.
Quickly as sometimes like do you want to.
Go out to dinner do you want to go get.
Ice cream right now ten minutes later.
Close.
I think together surprising i think is.
Going better than i expected.
Music.
No kind of guy i'm a good kind of a.
Mutually beneficial relationship what is.
It called in science oh a symbiotic.
Relationship.
