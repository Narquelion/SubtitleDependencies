1
00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:11,090
here you are

2
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,559
oh thank you oh oh my god that's not

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,190
here let me mug you instead don't even

4
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,540
worry about it

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,540
well man with a knife

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:29,070
you think pretty genius huh

7
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:33,580
well maybe not ingenious but definitely

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,810
ingenious do you see how irritating that

9
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,070
is this video is actually nothing like

10
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,750
what the title says well I mean

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,280
technically it was about a woman trying

12
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:42,190
to mug a man who happens to have a knife

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,489
and what he did next was kinda genius

14
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,629
but definitely more Gina SH do look this

15
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:48,760
video is about something that I've been

16
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:50,379
irritated with for a very long time now

17
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,460
and even more so because I feel like

18
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:53,230
it's happening more and more these days

19
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:56,140
as you can probably already tell I'm

20
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:57,430
talking about misleading titles I don't

21
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,780
know about you guys I get really upset

22
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,579
when there's articles that have really

23
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,050
intriguing and interesting titles but

24
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:03,520
then when you click on them the story or

25
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,989
video or whatever it's supposed to be is

26
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,250
nothing like the title basically these

27
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:07,630
websites and post these articles and

28
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,009
videos try and come up with any single

29
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,570
title that will get you to click on them

30
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:12,399
even if the article or video is barely

31
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,899
related they'll still try and exaggerate

32
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:15,670
the title just so you click on I mean I

33
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:17,590
guess it's kinda exactly what I did in

34
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,030
this video the sad part is this video is

35
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,380
actually more relevant to the title than

36
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,130
most articles these days you know which

37
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,270
ones I'm talking about

38
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,470
you'll be on Facebook scrolling through

39
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,550
your newsfeed and all of a sudden you

40
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,800
see an article is saying something like

41
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,300
this man boom the secret to a living

42
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,190
forever exclamation point exclamation

43
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,780
point exclamation point but really it's

44
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,160
just about a 95 year old man who can

45
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,569
still run a mile or something or maybe

46
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,340
you're on Twitter and you see a tweet

47
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:38,950
that says something like click on this

48
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,810
link to see the most amazing 5 year old

49
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,190
kid that ever lived and then it's just

50
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,990
like a video of a little boy on x-factor

51
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,429
who can sing amazingly well for his age

52
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,869
but it's still like pretty average in

53
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:48,039
comparison to most singers maybe you're

54
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:50,200
even on YouTube and you see a video

55
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:53,349
called woman tries to mug man with a

56
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,060
knife but what he did next was genius

57
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:56,649
but really it's just a video about a

58
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,270
stupid asian kid sitting in a chair in

59
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:59,349
front of a camera with no pants on but

60
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:06,729
it's not like you can see his bottom

61
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:08,319
half in the frame anyway what anyway

62
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:09,399
I've been tricked so many times into

63
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,420
clicking links that I'm almost at the

64
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:11,740
point where I just don't click them

65
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,240
anymore which actually sucks because

66
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,650
sometimes there are really good articles

67
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,910
and videos that actually do live up to

68
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,170
their title so again I'm sorry for

69
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,520
anyone who actually got tricked by the

70
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,020
title of this video I'm just trying to

71
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,730
make a point and spread this message so

72
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,140
that people stop using misleading titles

73
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,370
or if they do people at least call them

74
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,050
out for if you're like me and you're

75
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,460
consistent victim to these misleading

76
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,020
titles then help me spread this message

77
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,430
