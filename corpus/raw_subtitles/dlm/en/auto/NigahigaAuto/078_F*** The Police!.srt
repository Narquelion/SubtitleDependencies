00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,540
hey guys I recently got pulled over for

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,190
the first time in a long time for going

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,080
six miles per hour over the speed limit

4
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,030
true story when it comes to being pulled

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,290
over I'm either really lucky or really

6
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,059
good at getting out of getting a ticket

7
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,920
I've been pulled over a total of four

8
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,269
times now and each time I got off with a

9
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,740
warning this last time was probably the

10
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,420
stupidest reason I've ever gotten pulled

11
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,010
over but I have to admit the first three

12
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,510
times I kind of deserved it the first

13
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,220
time I got pulled over it was because I

14
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,689
just didn't completely stop at a stop

15
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,269
sign okay something that didn't really

16
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:29,250
stop at all at the stop sign I kind of

17
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:36,180
drifted what Tokyo Drift was big at the

18
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:38,219
time yo all right I mean the second time

19
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,079
I kind of ran a red light and I come on

20
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,489
it was an emergency I had to poop there

21
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,870
should be a special light for that there

22
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:46,739
should be a brown light well I mean I

23
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:50,309
guess sometimes green does work yo all

24
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:52,289
right and the third time I mean it was

25
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:56,940
even a big deal I just kind of stole the

26
00:00:52,289 --> 00:01:00,590
Toyota oh my god go go go we wasn't even

27
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,590
chasing I stole this Toyota

28
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:08,930
Yolo I deserve a ticket right now for

29
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:10,670
saying Yolo three times in one video for

30
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,990
now anyway I've had a lot of reasons to

31
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,250
hate the police just like everyone else

32
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,780
I'm not going to because could you

33
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,280
imagine how much it already sucks to be

34
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,630
a policeman I mean everyone hates on the

35
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,130
net cake wrappers for example they're

36
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,180
one of the most influential people in

37
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,350
this world and yet they're always

38
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,880
hitting on the police in their song

39
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:25,360
especially for whatever reason at the

40
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,980
end of a verse right before the chorus

41
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,980
[Music]

42
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,940
but I'm not a rapper clearly back to the

43
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,440
top like I was saying before I got

44
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,909
pulled over a few nights ago and gotten

45
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,740
that up with a warning once again I know

46
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:44,390
so many people who still get tickets for

47
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,009
stupid reasons like this so like I said

48
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,420
either you're really unlucky or you're

49
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:48,740
probably just doing it wrong so I'm

50
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,420
gonna be giving you guys some tips on

51
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,830
how not to get tickets these are the top

52
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,659
three things that you shouldn't do when

53
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:55,250
you get pulled over don't ever try to

54
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:55,670
convince him that he's wrong or you made

55
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,080
a mistake

56
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:59,149
do you know why I pulled you over dope

57
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:02,090
actually I really don't because I'm very

58
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:04,399
sure I was waiting 35 do not make any

59
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:07,550
excuses unless if it's an emergency like

60
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,810
your cat is flying do you know why I

61
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,099
pulled you over me I mean it's not my

62
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,750
fault I couldn't see the speed limit

63
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:14,840
sign I was going way too fast it was all

64
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:16,580
blurry you know and no matter what we do

65
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,870
not undermine him or trying to be a jerk

66
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,060
to him do you know why I pulled you over

67
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,290
um cuz it's a slow day for you you had

68
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,520
nothing better to do you used to be

69
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,540
popular in high school and you had all

70
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,739
the power in the world and all of a

71
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,000
sudden with high school ended you had no

72
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:27,200
power so you decide to become a police

73
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,360
man and pull people over for no good

74
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,280
reason what you want to do is show

75
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,420
complete respect this is pretty close to

76
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,980
what it looked like when I got pulled

77
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,540
over do you know why I pulled you over I

78
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,220
am so sorry officer it was completely

79
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,569
irresponsible of me and I should not

80
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,670
have been going that fast I sincerely

81
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:41,870

00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,739

oh and of course if that method doesn't

88
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,030

89
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,100
well do you know why I put you all up

90
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,840

much crime so much injustice so many

95
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,960
murders well I mean there already are a

96
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,130
lot of murders

97
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,600
I mean it's especially with all the

98
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,920
shootings lately and please do not start

99
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,090
another gun control debate in the

100
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,560
comments do you really want to know the

101
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,730
answer to keeping our people safe the

102
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,330
answer has been right in front of us the

103
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,640
whole time

we're pretty much like best friends now

110
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:43,590
so overall just remember the best way to

111
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,090
get out of getting a ticket is by not

112
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,709
getting in one at all and keep in mind

113
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,200
that all the laws make complete sense

114
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:50,490
and are here for a reason and if there's

115
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,140
just one thing that you can take from

116
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:55,020
this video or one thing that you can

117
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:56,370
