podcast today joining us we have puck

9
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:38,489
Alito

10
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:47,700
as usual her huge and a very special

11
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:49,860
guest miss Arden Cho and I said we

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,940
shouldn't bring in but she's been she

13
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,370
doesn't she doesn't bark she's not a

14
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:58,930
normal dog yeah and she follows me every

15
00:00:53,370 --> 00:01:00,020
was it yeah she's the runt of the litter

16
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,640
[Music]

17
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:05,700
no I think it's because she grew up on

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,950
set with me that is not the reason is

19
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,330
like you trained her to be quiet you

20
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,070
didn't not treat her she was always like

21
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,360
that I don't know if I trained her to be

22
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,119
quiet I definitely didn't but I think

23
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,830
shooting always used to being around a

24
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,110
lot of things happening in production

25
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,210
and I think she got used to it you so

26
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,189
you don't think that the reason why

27
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,330
she's quiet has nothing to do with the

28
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:27,060
fact that she's the runt of the litter

29
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,700
and yeah well I thought she was deaf for

30
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,000
the first like two years she never

31
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,439
burned she's the best on looks like she

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,869
just popped a couple of leather you see

33
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,180
in her frame I think they're like a very

34
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:40,860
bottom the very bottom the frame looks

35
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,869
like you're you're forcing her to be or

36
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,549

00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:34,710
in not so much the Instagram thing I

82
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:38,110

00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:39,700
you're Lucy I can't get out of it no and

84
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:42,700

85
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,960
I want to I'm sure you know I know like

86
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,120
I know it's a dream

87
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,380
I know when I'm in the dream I know

88
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,720
because I always have these dreams that

89
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,520
my teeth are falling out and like I know

90
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,780
that it's a dream cuz something terrible

91
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,160
is happening that I'm like this just

92
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,470
wouldn't happen in real life you can't

93
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,360
change it and I can't change it huh it's

94
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:01,090
taraf dude I had a weird but I know that

95
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,790
I'm in the dream this is not even this

96
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:06,670
dream was very like big to me but it

97
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:09,430
seems so lame basically we were at

98
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:11,740
Ryan's house all chillin hanging out and

99
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,600
then they're like Paco we got a gift for

100
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,880
you and I was like what and he gives me

101
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,790
a like a small box and I open it and

102
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,620
it's a business card

103
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:26,260
what does it have your name on it yes it

104
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:26,650
says CEO like I can finally buy props

105
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:31,449
and

106
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:33,070
uh-oh y'all business card we're both

107
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:34,690
thinking the same thing I was thinking

108
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,410
like a like a card that says like oh

109
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,070
yeah

110
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:40,810
Paco rhpc a credit card well that's kind

111
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,190
of based on like reality that's like

112
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,060
real life because i everybody never

113
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,919
makes sense

114
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:51,460
usually mine don't but this one was like

115
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:54,100
they trust me sorry

116
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,330
maybe maybe in a couple years I don't

117
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,130
want to get back into the dream thing

118
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,960
yeah married we've been talking about

119
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,820
that I feel like we always end up there

120
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,680
even with like David we started talking

121
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,800
about it you guys are weird like that no

122
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:09,280
I just think dreams are so interesting

123
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,720
anyway what have you been up to people

124
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,310
want to know people have been asking for

125
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:17,229
you to be on this since the announcement

126
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:19,690
well they've been asking for Arden Jay

127
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:29,080
oh I'm sorry I didn't know her

128
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:32,500
yeah who is she she's like Harry J

129
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,940
they've been asking for you and why

130
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,470
don't we get a like quick introductory

131
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,940
to like for some people maybe I don't

132
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:39,460
know who you are yeah

133
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:44,320
so just to start I mean Arden Arden Cho

134
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:48,280
is a actor slash I guess a lot of things

135
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,139
actor slash singer slash CEO you CEO yes

136
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:54,460
you should talk about that actually took

137
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:57,160
over a company go ahead Oh talk about

138
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,169
that I searched so four years ago I

139
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,699
co-founded a company called Leonard in

140
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:04,090
Church yes we make watches and make dog

141
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:05,889
collars and it's like a lifestyle brand

142
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:09,099
that is bringing affordable quality

143
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:10,570
pieces to you why watches though so I

144
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:12,370
collected watches since I was in high

145
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,530
school I think everyone should wear

146
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:15,639
watch and low key judge people and they

147
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,800
don't wear watches because I feel like

148
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:20,860
they don't value time and that they

149
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:24,639
don't respect people it's more of a

150
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:26,680
fashion what's the first thing on but

151
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,940
but that's a thing I feel like let's say

152
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,070
you're in a meeting or let's say we're

153
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,539
in this podcast or you're in class I

154
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,099
think it's really rude to pull out your

155
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:34,810
phone and check the time true but I

156
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:37,390
think it's fine to like yeah but if

157
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:41,310
you're to buy your watch okay nobody

158
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:44,650
checks their time like this I do

159
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:47,280
I am wearing it now to support guys go

160
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:50,259
to Leonard Church is calm it is better

161
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,360
and support she needs people to buy

162
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:54,639
watches because they do company that she

163
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,349
just over it's not a new company she

164
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,300
just took over as CEO though right so we

165
00:06:56,349 --> 00:07:00,610
we've been going for about four years

166
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:03,219
and then a couple years into it I mean

167
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:04,780
it's your it's a typical small start-up

168
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:07,120
company we were bootstrapping a very

169
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,639
very small team of friends and after a

170
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,599
couple years everyone just sort of got

171
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:15,759
tired and we kind of it was kind of a

172
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,979
side project yeah everybody was a side

173
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,620
thing it was hard to really like nobody

174
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:22,719
was full-time and then about I think it

175
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:25,750
around like 2017 2018 it was pretty much

176
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:27,370
out of standstill and so around 2018

177
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:30,550
when basically my partner's were like

178
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:32,439
hey I think we are all kind of you know

179
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:36,789
it was fun to try but we're kind of over

180
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:38,259
it I felt like you know we didn't really

181
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,750
get to do what I wanted to do with a

182
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:42,699
company I always wanted to make all the

183
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,589
watches that I loved and hopefully other

184
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:46,180
leather goods as well and so it was a

185
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,500
good start but I felt like there were a

186
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:50,889
lot of things I didn't get to try yet

187
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,599
and so yeah at the end of last year we

188
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:54,639
slowly trying to just we slowly

189
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:57,279
transitioned and I took over the company

190
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,900
yeah top of the year so yeah it's new

191
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:01,330
and we're going through a lot of changes

192
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:04,870
I have a new team now but it's very

193
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:06,400
small very small well just like it but

194
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,169
the watches are actually mad dope like

195
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,539
whenever I go on dates I make sure to

196
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:13,330
wear it yeah pocket and then the girls

197
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:15,699
like dang like - you're a pretty

198
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:17,080
disgusting person but that watch you're

199
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:18,879
not going to know they do not say that

200
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,490
yeah you're right they're like you know

201
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,159
what these watches are like they look

202
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,599
expensive but that's the thing I like

203
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:27,069
about that I mean that your whole motto

204
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,960
was trying to get stuff that's not read

205
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:30,430
it because watches are like so expensive

206
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,320
some of them but that's a thing the

207
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,849
reason when I started making watches was

208
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,979
because since I collected watches since

209
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:37,599
I was younger you know eventually as I

210
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:39,610
got older all my dream watches were

211
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,890
getting so so expensive I mean they're

212
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:44,410
more expensive than cars and houses it's

213
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:47,380
insane and she still bought them I mean

214
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:49,779
no not a collector I mean not all of

215
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,190
them that Teen Wolf money huh no she was

216
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:53,450
on Teen Wolf for people definitely not

217
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:56,600
enough money

218
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:58,970
no but damn shame it's other hard worked

219
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,160
money no but I think for me I started

220
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:03,140
realizing that as I was learning about

221
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,750
the watch business it was just so

222
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:07,520
inflated the pricing and I realized

223
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,110
you're really paying for the name and I

224
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,660
wanted to make great quality timepieces

225
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,430
that I could sort of interchange and mix

226
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,320
with the nicer pieces I have because you

227
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:17,390
know it's like if you have a luxury car

228
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,100
wants to say like a Ferrari or a Porsche

229
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,140
you don't always drive that everyday

230
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,820
that might be your weekend car so I

231
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:26,090
wanted to make a watch that essentially

232
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:27,860
could mix in with higher-end watches but

233
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:29,480
never feel like I was going lower in

234
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,730
quality if that makes sense

235
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,470
like our automatic watch I feel like our

236
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:35,210
manufacturer advised us to sell it

237
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:37,040
around like fifteen hundred two thousand

238
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:39,500
dollars and we solved for like right

239
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,430
under $400 so I just wanted to make it

240
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,900
really affordable and that's a watch

241
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:43,340
that will last you a lifetime it's

242
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,790
automatic you don't need a new battery

243
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:50,330
and so yeah good I'm really proud of it

244
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:53,090
so okay that's good yeah

245
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:54,410
but I want out only hears about the we

246
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:56,180
talked about you mentioned Teen Wolf a

247
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:57,950
little bit that kind the watches are

248
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,930
dope and everything but you know I know

249
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:01,490
people care about team oh yeah a lot of

250
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,590
people want to know about that and do

251
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:07,100
you kind of like consider that like your

252
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:10,070
start like that really opened up acting

253
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,600
for you well I I feel like if I look

254
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:13,070
back at the last 10 years of my career

255
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,990
there's definitely like two moments I

256
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:18,380
mean one actually is when I met you guys

257
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:20,750
and we work together good stuff yeah I

258
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:22,100
think that was a huge yeah for ass that

259
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:24,140
was a huge turning point because I

260
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,960
learned a lot about sort of that online

261
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:28,760
world which started music and YouTube

262
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,710
for me and that really kept me afloat

263
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,810
for almost like 6-7 years in LA and if

264
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:36,050
it wasn't for Ryan and Wang fu

265
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:38,690
encouraging me to pursue YouTube

266
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:41,090
platform I don't know if Tim Wolfe would

267
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:42,770
have happened because I think at the

268
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:44,360
time when I auditioned for Teen Wolf I

269
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:46,400
was in a place where I was actually

270
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,850
ready to quit acting I was gonna go on

271
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,370
tour

272
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:51,770
I just finished recording my album and I

273
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:54,320
was ready to sort of do shows and have

274
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:55,700
fun and not do that audition grind so I

275
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,320
went into that audition like I don't

276
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:00,440
even care talk about that audition

277
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,700
because I yeah you did but talk about

278
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,830
that audition Gregor's a lot of people

279
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,740
don't know and realize I mean you you

280
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,800
tell me all the time when you know

281
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,240
you're

282
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,980
I mean you're nice enough where a lot of

283
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,750
people reach out like random people and

284
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,950
I even I'm like why are you gonna go

285
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,660
meet this random person well if they're

286
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,890
sketch and usually it's like some you

287
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,480
know younger girl who looked up to you

288
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:19,190
because she watched Teen Wolf where she

289
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,950
watches Chicago man whatever it is and

290
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:24,290
they hit you up and they want to be an

291
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:26,420
actress or an actor and you go and meet

292
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:28,250
with them which is very nice of you I

293
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,660
still think it can be sketch well you

294
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:32,180
always think he always thinks the worst

295
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,769
he's always like well I and this person

296
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:38,529
is going to kill you and I'm like it's

297
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:38,529
like a 23 year old girl might be

298
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,180
actually I have met a crazy girl and she

299
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,890
did the same thing she emailed me like

300
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:48,019
every month for about a year and then I

301
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:51,920
met her and she turned out to be psycho

302
00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:53,959
like actually that's what I yeah so that

303
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,510
that has happened it is the nice side of

304
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:57,440
you that does that and I think people a

305
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,450
lot of times you were telling me that

306
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,820
they a lot of people just kind of assume

307
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:03,350
you know if you work hard at this thing

308
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,180
it's gonna happen but that's not

309
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:08,570
necessarily the case so why don't you

310
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:11,149
talk about that whole actor life yeah I

311
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:12,649
would say acting wow it really is a

312
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:14,480
grind I don't think there ever is a

313
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:16,670
point in your career unless you're sort

314
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,610
of in that top one percentile where it's

315
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,959
not really a grind we're at that point

316
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:23,180
you're sort of getting offers and you're

317
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,980
really choosing when you say 1% are you

318
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,170
talking like a listers yeah your top top

319
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:36,290
a listers I mean I still see stars at

320
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:43,070
auditions and I'm like like who time

321
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:45,200
like I was like oh you're totally gonna

322
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:47,029
get it I'm like it's cool though

323
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,399
I would book you to like you're way

324
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:51,560
funnier sure you're not saying that no

325
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:53,120
no I would oh no no I'm like thinking it

326
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,649
oh that was a producer and I'm

327
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,959
auditioning like I'd probably that girl

328
00:12:54,649 --> 00:13:00,020
but also to its I'm being realistic but

329
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,399
she's been in a bunch of movies I'm

330
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,949
there's a few people that I'm like yeah

331
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:05,690
I booked her tell us one no I don't why

332
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:08,000
no I think it's gonna offend them is it

333
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:09,829
private auditions are not private are

334
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,390
they sometimes because I think some

335
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:13,040
people you might be embarrassed if

336
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,959
people knew that the auditions are

337
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,940
certain things I just want to respect

338
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,340
people you never know but yeah basically

339
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:21,230
back to the audition grind I mean

340
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,360
I think a lot of people think that you

341
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:25,670
just care about a project you audition

342
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,250
and then you book it but it's definitely

343
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:30,320
not like that I think there's just a

344
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:32,600
long process where there are auditions

345
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,100
there's callbacks there is producer

346
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,650
sessions director sessions there's

347
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,800
there's so many sessions until you're in

348
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:41,839
the mix and then when you're in the mix

349
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,910
for TV they'll then choose a few for

350
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,910
like chemistry tests or screen testing

351
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:48,320
and then go from there and Teen Wolf was

352
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:52,100
a really tough process actually I

353
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:55,580
auditioned for it I think at least three

354
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:59,180
times before the chem read that I had

355
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:02,210
with tyler posey and then even after

356
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:04,760
that I think the network or the producer

357
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:06,350
somebody wasn't quite sold I think it

358
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:11,120
might have been like an age thing or the

359
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:12,620
fact that I wasn't Japanese either way

360
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:18,470
we ended up having to but you are

361
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:21,230
Japanese so yeah they actually had me

362
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:23,089
come all the way to set they had the set

363
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:26,210
team do my hair and makeup they were

364
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:28,420
amazing they like put me basically on

365
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:31,370
set and we ended up shooting our

366
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:32,839
audition scene with like the actual crew

367
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,610
is amazing like they went above and

368
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,930
beyond to really fight to get me that

369
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,670
opportunity so I'm really thankful for

370
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:39,170
that and I would definitely say an

371
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:41,210
epochal asked earlier but I would say

372
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:43,640
Teen Wolf was at least in my acting

373
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:45,890
career probably the biggest moment that

374
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,750
sort of set the tone for I guess the

375
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:50,600
start of my career and what I felt like

376
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:53,030
I don't know I don't wanna say like it

377
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,410
defines me but I definitely think it's

378
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,610
something that I'll always look back and

379
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,290
say oh I'm really thankful for that

380
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:00,560
experience and I'm so happy to have been

381
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:02,240
cure you Kimura especially because 11 12

382
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,570
years ago when I moved out to LA I never

383
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:09,050
imagined that I'd actually be on not

384
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:12,080
only a TV show but a hit TV show and to

385
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:13,370
be a series regular and a cool janna

386
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,860
cool character brightly action-based

387
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,910
like superpower character right and the

388
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,190
thing that's really fun about that is

389
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:21,860
she actually I don't think was intended

390
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:23,510
to have a lot of action and stuff but I

391
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,709
think the writers and the creators of

392
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,600
the show they're really good about

393
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:28,610
incorporating what the actual actor

394
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,900
knows how to do so I remember by like

395
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,550
season four they'd be like hey what

396
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,040
weapons do you know and because I knew

397
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:35,230
how to use nunchucks they like random

398
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,870
threw that in there and I started season

399
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:40,029
4 play with nunchucks and so that was a

400
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:42,730
lot of fun so I feel like Kira sort of

401
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:44,560
evolved to be like a version of me you

402
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:48,180
know and a version of her and so I shall

403
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,889
always be like special to me Kira Kira

404
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:54,910
Kira goes unless you'll come you Kimura

405
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:58,690
you know you kumuda yeah I can't even

406
00:15:54,910 --> 00:16:03,279
say about speaking about that I know

407
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:04,959
you're Japanese what did you take no so

408
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,639
you know what man you're stealing this I

409
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,810
was gonna make a video about it okay

410
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,180
it's all good no no but you know what

411
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:11,920
we're gonna announce it on on off the

412
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,930
pill podcast right now because you know

413
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,990
it's some super top secret information

414
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:19,800
is it I think you know help you actually

415
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:23,160
cuz you can more roles now I guess

416
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:25,540
freshly appropriating something you know

417
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,339
like for that I don't think so right no

418
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:30,610
I mean I just don't really care I will

419
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:34,480
say though it's disappointing that as

420
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:37,480
Asian American actors we are limited to

421
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,389
only play your own ethnicity when

422
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,819
American actors or British actors or

423
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:46,089
Australian actors really play anything

424
00:16:42,819 --> 00:16:48,190
that can pass as white so I think that's

425
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:50,079
really unfair I don't think I should

426
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:52,149
play a role that's let's say Filipino or

427
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,670
Indian cuz obviously I don't think I can

428
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:57,940
physically pass for that but speaking of

429
00:16:54,670 --> 00:17:00,760
the DNA test I took three and there was

430
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:02,410
one that was like junk it actually just

431
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,199
said you were a hundred percent Asian

432
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:07,870
and I was like great I knew that and

433
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:10,870
then there was one that said I was 60%

434
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:13,329
Japanese and 30% Chinese Vietnamese like

435
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:16,419
I think like 10% and like Mongolian

436
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:17,909
makes random stuff no Korean and then

437
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:21,699
there was another test that said I was

438
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:23,500
like 40 percent Korean and then a bunch

439
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:25,419
of other stuff and Japanese - Japanese

440
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,730
yeah but was the consistent right so the

441
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:30,159
consistence thing was that I was mostly

442
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:32,980
Japanese and Chinese so I was like wait

443
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:36,010
that's so weird so I'm not Korean and

444
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:37,690
then I asked my mom she was like hmm I

445
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:41,169
was like what I thought she was gonna be

446
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:44,200
like woah we're Cory on but she was just

447
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:47,020
like you know in Asia everybody is just

448
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:50,320
you know where you live you're Korean

449
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:52,930
culturally you are Korean you speak

450
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,850
Korean you're I mean you know more

451
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:56,320
Korean people who would speak fluent

452
00:17:54,850 --> 00:18:00,610
Korean say that you're Koreans like

453
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:03,730
perfect we can get the homework hotel no

454
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:05,020
that's the next I can hear it it was

455
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:08,050
awkward cuz they came out of nowhere

456
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:11,080
oh but Ryan's big screen no I don't yeah

457
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:15,240
he does come on xiety okay did I speak

458
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:18,040
Korean - yeah what do you know beyond a

459
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,840
pope in 30 that means I mean Herbert oh

460
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:22,230
yeah you probably get that a lot I get

461
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,230
that a lot

462
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:28,150
no but really though you were saying I

463
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:29,230
mean in actor life and this is a true

464
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,510
thing you've been turned down roles

465
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:32,440
because you weren't a certain type oh

466
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,440
yeah

467
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,850
I mean any of you weren't Chinese or

468
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,680
technically if you were to show the DNA

469
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:41,920
results you could be like I have

470
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:44,470
Japanese I have cuz your character on

471
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,610
Teen Wolf was Japanese right Korean well

472
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,350
just happen that's the thing she was

473
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:51,010
supposed to be full Japanese she's

474
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:53,320
curico muda but because I got casted for

475
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:55,720
the show they actually made her half

476
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,030
Korean half Japanese which was awesome

477
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,100
but I don't think it was necessary but

478
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:01,690
it did bring a really cool storyline

479
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,660
talking about Japanese heritage and why

480
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:06,790
we took my mother's last name versus our

481
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:09,460
fathers and we had some really great

482
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:11,170
episodes about that and so I think it

483
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,760
turned out better but I don't think it

484
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:14,350
was necessary because I think if she was

485
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:17,050
full Japanese I think I could have still

486
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:19,300
passed is that right so yeah I think

487
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:21,070
about when people because there's a huge

488
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,870
community especially Asian community who

489
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:24,130
get really upset - oh yeah I think

490
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,200
that's part of the reason why people

491
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:28,960
want to cast exactly what it's said to

492
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,580
be but I mean what do you think about

493
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,980
that I mean there's so many people who

494
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,570
are you know it's hard it's like a it's

495
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:37,090
it's hard to balance that it's like you

496
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:38,890
don't want people to appropriate like

497
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,910
you don't want it to be whitewashed but

498
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,480
at the same time where do you draw the

499
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:42,460
line

500
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,910
you know I think you draw the line when

501
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:48,490
creatively you will sort of harm the

502
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:51,460
project for example like there is a part

503
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:53,140
that I've you know politely turned down

504
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:55,270
because the role was mandarin-speaking

505
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,740
and they were only going to give me like

506
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:58,000
two to three months of dialect coaching

507
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,920
and I didn't think that was enough for

508
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,620
me to be able to truly pass

509
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:05,320
and I knew about three actresses that I

510
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:07,510
thought were amazing and perfect for the

511
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,000
part and friends and so I just pass it

512
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:11,800
along and it was great for them but I

513
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,420
think for me I knew that as an actor I

514
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:18,730
couldn't do that well and so I think I

515
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:20,950
think for me and I hope other actors it

516
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:23,760
really just comes down to can you tell

517
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:29,110
the story well can you tell it without

518
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:30,130
sort of disturbing yes the same idea

519
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,780
right right right

520
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:33,670
the authenticity of where that whole

521
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:37,750
project is coming yeah so I mean I think

522
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:40,240
if it's a character where yeah I mean

523
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:42,640
even if it's someone who even though I

524
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,020
speak Korean if the film is about

525
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,640
someone who like comes from Korea to

526
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,620
speak English I don't think that I would

527
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,060
probably be the best for the part he's

528
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:51,730
going to be other actors that are great

529
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:54,490
for it but I think if it's a girl from

530
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:56,800
Hong Kong and she's supposed to be

531
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:59,140
ethnically Chinese but she's in America

532
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,210
or even if she grew up in Hong Kong but

533
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:03,610
she went to like International School I

534
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:05,650
think I could play that because I speak

535
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:07,450
English and I've been to Hong Kong and

536
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:09,670
and now when you went to casting you

537
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:12,040
should bring in your DNA results and be

538
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:13,870
like look I am actually I think most

539
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,480
people like I mean because our parents

540
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:19,240
you know a lot especially first gen not

541
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,800
that mines are but a lot of parents of

542
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,170
friends that I know are very proud

543
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,540
obviously they go 8 Asians are just I

544
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,770
mean they fight amongst each other yeah

545
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,020
that's the main problem I think

546
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:30,760
underlying issue is there's a lot of

547
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:34,060
racism within the Asian culture there's

548
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:36,520
so much racism even from Koreans to

549
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:38,470
Korean Americans and people in China to

550
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,720
Chinese Americans and then not to

551
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:42,670
mention you know Korea and Japan and you

552
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,890
know etc etc there's so much racism that

553
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:46,660
is within the Asian cultures that causes

554
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:49,600
all this animosity so the issue really

555
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:51,970
isn't casting because I think right now

556
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,220
and what I always tell people is we just

557
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:56,560
need more stories you don't I mean and I

558
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:59,170
think for example I just give and a good

559
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,970
friend of mine she is not Korean but she

560
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:03,910
plays the lead in soul-searching which

561
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:05,350
is about Koreans going to Korea to find

562
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:07,930
out about their identity but their

563
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:09,700
adopted Koreans and she absolutely kills

564
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:11,590
the film yeah and it makes me so happy

565
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,950
I've seen it like seven times and I'm so

566
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:15,770
proud of her

567
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:18,410
as someone who is ethnically Korean I'm

568
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:20,300
really really happy that she portrayed

569
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:22,160
that character so well and I don't think

570
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:25,880
anyone else could have done it as well

571
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:29,000
as she did and to me if that movie helps

572
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,590
her build her career then she will one

573
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,420
day be at a place where she can then

574
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:35,030
talk about who she really is

575
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:37,700
and she speaks Mandarin she does a lot

576
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:40,250
of things and now we understand more

577
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:41,960
about Asians you know I'm saying whereas

578
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,640
I think if we don't if we block those

579
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,610
opportunities and if Asians are the ones

580
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,990
complaining about Miss casting then

581
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:49,610
casting directors are just gonna cast

582
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:51,770
white and I've heard this a lot like

583
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:53,150
they'll be like oh it's an anime we need

584
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,710
Japanese and they're like oh we can't

585
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:57,230
find Japanese actors and you're Korean

586
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:59,360
and you're Chinese they're like we just

587
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:01,280
don't want to upset people so we're

588
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:05,090
gonna upset people anyways we'll just

589
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:07,040
cast white and so I'm always like so

590
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:08,480
frustrated when I hear that and so

591
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,160
that's why one of the reasons why like I

592
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,770
love sharing sort of casting information

593
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:16,910
with a lot of my actor friends is that I

594
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:19,400
hope it stays ethnic because we have a

595
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:22,460
smaller pool to choose from yeah I think

596
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,900
that's why when other s like I think

597
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:26,090
that's why when Caucasians are like oh

598
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:29,060
well that role was supposed to be white

599
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:30,560
and it went to a black actor or went to

600
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:32,420
an Asian actor and they get upset about

601
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:35,150
it I'm like are you serious right now

602
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:38,210
we have less opportunities to choose

603
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:39,350
from to begin with yeah you know I mean

604
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:41,480
they're seeing it they're seeing it from

605
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:42,890
a like principle standard there's you

606
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,120
know because there's such a heavy push

607
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:45,800
behind anything there's always gonna be

608
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,700
a counter action I mean I agree

609
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:51,560
obviously they've dominated the realm

610
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:53,240
but I can see what they're trying to say

611
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:56,300
like based on principles like well

612
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:58,910
technically you know if that person in

613
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:01,370
the story is Asian and you cast white

614
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:03,680
you guys would be upset so why are you

615
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:06,050
allowing this white person in this story

616
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,550
being cast as something else so I could

617
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:09,590
I could see what they're trying to say

618
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:10,730
but I also see what you're trying to say

619
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,410
I think you're never gonna I think

620
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:15,110
there's gonna be a lot that disagree

621
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:18,020
with you yeah I've already seen it and I

622
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:18,650
just like I just sit back just like this

623
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:21,160
is theirs

624
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:25,130
to me I think I mean it's it's very

625
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:26,809
important to your specific job yeah and

626
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,639
so I wanted you to speak about it

627
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:31,129
because you deal with that all the time

628
00:24:28,639 --> 00:24:32,539
oh of course and and of course there's

629
00:24:31,129 --> 00:24:35,269
always a part of me that's going to try

630
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:36,830
to be considerate of what people will

631
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:39,110
feel and you know how it might be

632
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:40,220
perceived but I always tell people you

633
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,019
have to think about it this way

634
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,999
wouldn't you want a show like

635
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:46,820
fresh-off-the-boat to exist and to be

636
00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:48,440
great as it is or them to have just not

637
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,919
done it because they couldn't find the

638
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,499
father

639
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:54,080
cuz Randall Park is great he's so great

640
00:24:51,499 --> 00:24:56,029
but he's not Chinese nice Korean but I

641
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,860
think he's great and so I don't think

642
00:24:56,029 --> 00:24:59,779
that should be an issue you're saying

643
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:03,169
also shouldn't be because most of those

644
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:04,730
people know most asian ethnicities are

645
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:06,350
not a hundred percent anything right

646
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:08,029
right and so that's why I'm saying I

647
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:10,399
think the people who are upset are the

648
00:25:08,029 --> 00:25:12,769
ones that are extremely prideful and I'm

649
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:14,809
sorry to say this racist yeah it's it's

650
00:25:12,769 --> 00:25:16,580
well it's people would take a lot I

651
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:17,990
think this is where it comes from it's

652
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:20,119
parents would take so much pride in

653
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:22,340
their culture which is a great thing but

654
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:23,690
I mean if you're really breaking it down

655
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:25,820
I think that's about what it is based on

656
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:27,980
it's like this is a culturally Korean

657
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:30,860
thing but like like just like you you're

658
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:33,049
culturally Korean but technically you

659
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:35,269
might not be full Korean right

660
00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:37,460
technically unless we find out later

661
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:40,999
down the road all these DNA tests or all

662
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:44,059
scans I kind of felt like there's a

663
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:45,679
possibility I have heard that there's

664
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:48,230
just not enough data for Asian people

665
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,990
which is why the tests all came out so

666
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:52,730
different right so I'm I was recommended

667
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:56,029
to do it again in a couple years once

668
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:59,960
the data pool has increased the data

669
00:25:56,029 --> 00:26:04,789
pool yeah all right well going on to

670
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:06,049
back to acting and stuff I guess a lot

671
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:08,629
something that a lot of people were very

672
00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:10,879
curious about is like what pushed you

673
00:26:08,629 --> 00:26:12,549
into this direction and did you get

674
00:26:10,879 --> 00:26:14,389
support from your friends and family

675
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:16,610
because that's something that you know

676
00:26:14,389 --> 00:26:19,249
look at that little smirk on your face I

677
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:22,039
know you got something to say no I mean

678
00:26:19,249 --> 00:26:25,009
it's just I don't know sometimes now

679
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:27,799
that I'm older I think it's funny when I

680
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:29,570
look back and think how did I end up

681
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:31,820
here and how did I start this you know

682
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:33,619
it seems pretty crazy but yeah I mean

683
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,119
growing up I loved telling stories I

684
00:26:33,619 --> 00:26:36,710
love making people laugh I think I would

685
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:38,210
always sort of act out the date of my

686
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:39,379
parents and since I was like three or

687
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,900
four they said I was always singing

688
00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:42,940
around the house I knew I

689
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:45,310
to be a performer but then when I was in

690
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:47,500
high school in college I was too shy to

691
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:48,520
sort of join the drama club and I didn't

692
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,920
think I'd be good enough so I never

693
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,320
really auditioned it was really scared

694
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:55,330
to audition even also wanted to be with

695
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,400
no Asians right in the Midwest and so I

696
00:26:55,330 --> 00:27:02,050
grew up really confused about my

697
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:04,990
identity but um I think in college after

698
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:06,490
graduating I felt like and that's a

699
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:11,550
really long story but there was someone

700
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:22,990
who really encouraged me even issues yep

701
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:30,340
she's ours putting her dog down like put

702
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:30,940

708
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:57,510
back to acting yeah it's a really long

709
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:59,740
story but I was encouraged to pursue

710
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:01,840
what brought me joy and try to do

711
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:05,260
something good and radical with it and I

712
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:08,590
wanted to yeah hopefully make it a

713
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:10,480
friends not just as a female but as

714
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,890
animation American I grew up really

715
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,830
confused about my identity I thought I

716
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:16,450
was I think I thought I was white I was

717
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:20,260
like 20 I know it sounds really weird

718
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:21,670
but I mean you're I don't know if you

719
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,260
want to talk about it but you told me

720
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:25,690
that story about your kindergarten

721
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:27,400
teacher or something oh yeah I have

722
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:29,110
experienced so much racism my entire

723
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,210
life yeah I think when I was in

724
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:34,300
kindergarten I had a teacher sort of

725
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:36,190
split the class up in groups she was

726
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,990
like okay everybody with blue eyes on

727
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:39,550
this corner everybody with hazel eyes

728
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:42,130
here and everybody with brown eyes over

729
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:43,480
here and I was like oh I have brown eye

730
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:46,290
so I went over in the brown eyes group

731
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:50,200
and she was like what are you doing I

732
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:52,960
was like um going in the brown A's game

733
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,340
she's like no your eyes are black you're

734
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,220
all by yourself and I was like

735
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:59,740
what I'm like fives I'm like crying

736
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:01,480
inside but also just like to shock to

737
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,490
actually cry but that was sort of like

738
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:07,300
the beginning of where I was like oh I

739
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:09,190
am the only one that yeah different but

740
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:12,900
then I think growing up I really wanted

741
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:16,210
to fit in and I was born Amarillo

742
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:19,420
grew up in Dallas so mostly he lived in

743
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:20,530
Plano but a lot of I might be tripping

744
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,960
but I thought there was a lot of Asians

745
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:25,420
in Dallas now used in there are like 10

746
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:29,020
years after me oh okay is that what yeah

747
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:32,140
we each me up think about this at least

748
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:34,810
the teacher recognized you did have eyes

749
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:37,450
she could have said you have no eyes

750
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:41,680
that's because I'm an Asian with big

751
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:43,150
eyes they're all natural yeah whatever

752
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,620
don't be hating Paco just I'm stating

753
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,550
I'm saying she could have that's true

754
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,930
that's true I could have gotten even

755
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,970
worse you could have said ching chong

756
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:51,460
ding dong yeah oh dude you just went

757
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:52,600
racist again yeah I've gotten some of

758
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,980
those kinds of comments even with my

759
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:58,180
name they always try to make Arden Cho

760
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:59,380
somehow Asian Adriene known Chau and I'm

761
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:03,610
like what where did you get all those

762
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:05,020
extra letters that was their insults no

763
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:07,540
it would be actual teachers try to read

764
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:10,840
my name oh and they would always say

765
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:11,800
ciao ciao and even this morning I was on

766
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:15,630
the phone with the bank and they were

767
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:18,340
like Chu and I'm like it's ch Oh Cho

768
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:26,260
there's no you but they kept saying miss

769
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:28,300
Chu miss Chu clothes though grew up not

770
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:29,860
seeing Asian Americans on TV or media I

771
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,440
felt like I just didn't belong in this

772
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:34,840
world and I felt like an alien and I

773
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,310
think there are two ways you can go with

774
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,140
life can either sit back and complain

775
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:40,930
about it or you can get involved and do

776
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:42,490
something and so I was like I'm gonna

777
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:44,380
take a leap of faith and try to get

778
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:47,170
involved and do something and I moved to

779
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:48,970
LA it's like no money and two suitcases

780
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:52,240
and didn't know anybody found a roommate

781
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:54,730
on Craigslist who was crazy and then and

782
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:58,360
I cried every day for five years yep and

783
00:30:54,730 --> 00:31:00,790
then I filmed a YouTube video yep and

784
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:03,580
then I started making YouTube videos and

785
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:07,530
then it works jobs and Here I am today

786
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:11,580

00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:50,819
and then second impressions of each

899
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,410
other after reconnecting through

900
00:35:50,819 --> 00:35:54,299
Facebook okay

901
00:35:52,410 --> 00:36:00,720
first impressions were Facebook yeah the

902
00:35:54,299 --> 00:36:02,039
first time when I ate you up she has a

903
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,970
better memory so last time we talked

904
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:08,789
about we talked when we first met that

905
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:10,410
you you said I talked about this how we

906
00:36:08,789 --> 00:36:12,359
have different and I said I was gonna

907
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:16,010
let you talk tell your side how we think

908
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:19,829
we met at different times I think we met

909
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:21,990
well I I know I think I know that we did

910
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:24,240
not meet do you know add a casting thing

911
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:25,920
because Wong foo was casting for agents

912
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,289
of secret stuff yeah we did Emily

913
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,690
together I auditioned and we read

914
00:36:28,289 --> 00:36:32,369
together I don't and I was like I do not

915
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:35,220
recall I think my first impression of

916
00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:39,180
you was just like oh he's just like this

917
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:42,930
guy and I don't know what the hell think

918
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:45,299
I'm sorry but I'm there for like an

919
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:47,010
audition and so yeah I don't think I was

920
00:36:45,299 --> 00:36:50,250
thinking much of it I just want to do my

921
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:52,559
part well and I just thought didn't go

922
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:56,760
home and cry again i know ii swore that

923
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:58,470
I saw your audition via tape and not in

924
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,480
person that's why I think our stories

925
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:02,730
vary I think we should ask one of the

926
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,200
guys I was there like I know it must

927
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:06,089
have been Kristen was there and I think

928
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:09,299
Phil was there so we'll talk to one of

929
00:37:06,089 --> 00:37:11,250
those guys yeah films I mean first

930
00:37:09,299 --> 00:37:13,109
impression of Ryan was he's just some

931
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:15,000
guy yeah that's what she just said

932
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:17,520
that's what you so bad I mean no I mean

933
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,740
I just was like oh but you know what I

934
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,920
can't even remember so yeah he doesn't

935
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:25,319
even remember me so obviously he

936
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:27,329
obviously I was not memorable and Wow oh

937
00:37:25,319 --> 00:37:29,069
wow this is a real actor cuz I haven't

938
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:31,740
even worked with actors and I wasn't an

939
00:37:29,069 --> 00:37:34,020
actor I was just like oh man I better

940
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:35,490
like really I was intimidated not just

941
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,859
by her but like all the other actors I

942
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:41,119
feel like you were scared of me a little

943
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:43,360
I was scared of the whole situation

944
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:45,370
because even like getting a sound

945
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:47,470
and I wasn't used to that stuff I was

946
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:49,660
just like oh I better actually learn my

947
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:52,000
lines Paco knows how and I'm new in

948
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:54,700
videos I'll have stuff to that right but

949
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,860
I'll just go off-script he'll go like

950
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:59,080
line after line and he'll mess it up so

951
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:02,440
much and I'll go like sometimes it'll

952
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:07,030
change the story yeah let's do this now

953
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:09,250
yeah and then it messes everything up so

954
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:10,840
uh yeah all right I was more worried

955
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:12,850
about that I think at the time all right

956
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:17,320
and then uh so you guys are dating and

957
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:18,820
then there's a steak story which steak

958
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:21,820
are you talking about the first time

959
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:23,740
around the first time oh I think that's

960
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,790
funny I mean we'd even say that we've

961
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,470
dated the first time around that's

962
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:28,210
always like well we kind of dated yeah

963
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,500
no I mean it wasn't even like it was

964
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:31,360
just like we were getting to know each

965
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:33,340
other but I was only considered dating

966
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,170
yeah and I think we wanted different

967
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:36,520
things and honestly we didn't really

968
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:38,110
know what we wanted I mean I knew what I

969
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,060
wanted back then back then I wanted to

970
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:46,360
get married and have like 500 kids and

971
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:48,730
like it was just five really five it's

972
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:51,100
point you had your team you had your not

973
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:54,250
that I knew but you had a very strict

974
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:57,450
plan for your future and you send

975
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:59,170
reminders you had reminders for it I

976
00:38:57,450 --> 00:39:01,870
don't know if you want to bring that up

977
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:04,120
or not yeah no I was a little weird um I

978
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:06,790
basically thought that I'd be married

979
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:10,150
with kids by the time I was 23 and I met

980
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:11,980
Ryan when I was I think about weight 94

981
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:14,410
yeah about that age and so I think at

982
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:17,860
that point I was really feeling rushed

983
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:19,630
where I was just like whoever I date

984
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,070
next like we're gonna get married and so

985
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:22,600
unless we're gonna get married I don't

986
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:25,120
want to waste my time and so I think I

987
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,680
was a little bit kind of mean to you

988
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:29,140
because I kind of was like don't waste

989
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:31,210
my time cuz you young I wasn't mean then

990
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:33,610
again I wasn't mean back you were gonna

991
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:36,040
meet at the end though I was because I

992
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:38,800
was a little annoyed I was just like not

993
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:40,330
you I wasn't I was very like oh you were

994
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,200
not used to girls saying no to you

995
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:43,210
you're not used to their know-how

996
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,250
Shannon no I wasn't used to girls

997
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:47,800
pretending like they they liked you a

998
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:54,070
lot and then the next day they don't and

999
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:56,530
then they like you again okay in his can

1000
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:57,910
you can my defense yes it's

1001
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:59,560
not that I was pretending to like you

1002
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:01,480
and we've talked about this it was that

1003
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:03,220
there was a part of me that didn't like

1004
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,570
you you made me laugh and you were so

1005
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:07,810
fun and I thought you were really

1006
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:09,100
intelligent and charming and awesome but

1007
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:11,590
then there was this other part of me

1008
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:15,760
that was like no you have to think with

1009
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:17,740
your head scheduled he's too young he's

1010
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,030
not ready for anything serious like

1011
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:21,490
don't waste your time you're only

1012
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:23,110
getting older time is ticking tick tick

1013
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:26,230
tick you know so I think there was just

1014
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:28,090
I was really torn and so that was why I

1015
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:31,060
definitely wasn't gonna give I was nine

1016
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:32,170
twenty maybe at the time and like I so

1017
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,850
liked it the weird thing that was like a

1018
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:35,470
lot of awkward things were like we'd go

1019
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:36,160
not like we were dating but we'd go on

1020
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:41,680
like dates

1021
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:44,440
I guess that's dating yeah like because

1022
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:47,170
I'm underage and like to her she would

1023
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:48,850
make me feel like like I mean I was like

1024
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:50,500
I would feel embarrassed cuz we do like

1025
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:52,210
some of her friends and they would all

1026
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:54,430
be like a little older I mean not like

1027
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:55,960
24 25 they're older than you that's why

1028
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:57,700
yeah a lot of my friends are older and

1029
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:00,130
so then we were in situations where they

1030
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:02,200
were much older than you yeah like like

1031
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:04,960
seven eight years and then I'm just like

1032
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:07,690
oh I can't get wine I'm sorry and I

1033
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,400
think at that time like I was really not

1034
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:09,970
okay with that either so that bothered

1035
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,530
me a lot

1036
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:13,480
I would bother me too though it's a

1037
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:15,250
little different when the guys older I

1038
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,560
think oh no that's sexist

1039
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:19,720
no no but I think it's true right like

1040
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:21,760
it's a little it's not as as weird for

1041
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:24,910
the girl I guess but even then if you

1042
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,620
were a 25 year old guy or 20 40 or

1043
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:28,120
whatever and you were doing somebody who

1044
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:30,340
was 20 and you went to a restaurant with

1045
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:32,920
all your friends who are like 28 29 and

1046
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:34,420
you guys all got wine and this person

1047
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:37,150
gets carded and you can't even be there

1048
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:39,040
that would be a pretty awkward for you

1049
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:39,820
yeah wouldn't it yeah I mean if that was

1050
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,210
a girl mhm

1051
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:46,780
yeah but I think as girls it just feels

1052
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:49,210
less weird I think it just maybe it's

1053
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:52,300
sexist but I think I just really had one

1054
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:54,610
she with you being younger I was young

1055
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:58,390
yeah but obviously all right and I

1056
00:41:54,610 --> 00:42:01,570
caught her and now yeah right grandpa

1057
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:04,530
was so old and boring like I think I'm

1058
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:07,859
Way more fun but I'm also old and boring

1059
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:10,799
so now we're both old

1060
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:13,799
Sassie baby okay well roast you so hard

1061
00:42:10,799 --> 00:42:15,630
does fun things I do a lot of fun things

1062
00:42:13,799 --> 00:42:17,880
yeah I'm trying to do more fun things

1063
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:19,950
you already do I don't know why you're

1064
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,319
suddenly mean I want to do more fun

1065
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:24,900
things well because I didn't live my 20

1066
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:26,910
is very fun I think I was so ready to

1067
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:28,380
like grow up and be an adult but I

1068
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:30,930
didn't get to have a lot of fun so now

1069
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:33,390
in my 30s I'm trying to enjoy life more

1070
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:35,670
and have fun like I made Ryan to a

1071
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:37,680

1073
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,480
no I mean it's not but it was great we

1074
00:42:40,259 --> 00:42:45,210
had a nice dinner we went to get

1075
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:48,569
massages made a couples massage it was

1076
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:49,650
really romantic yeah we I just always

1077
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:52,619
thought that such a weird concept

1078
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:55,259
staycation where you get a hotel in the

1079
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:56,819
same city that you live in yeah and the

1080
00:42:55,259 --> 00:42:58,230
part of me I mean I got used to because

1081
00:42:56,819 --> 00:42:59,880
she likes doing that but apart me and

1082
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:01,739
first was just like it doesn't make

1083
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,329
sense we have a regular bed like a

1084
00:43:01,739 --> 00:43:05,009
cleaner one probably I don't need I

1085
00:43:03,329 --> 00:43:06,119
think about those kind of things when

1086
00:43:05,009 --> 00:43:08,940
I'm walking around hotel when you do

1087
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:10,769
barefoot I'm like man I know there's

1088
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:12,539
probably spit and like all kind of who

1089
00:43:10,769 --> 00:43:14,339
knows what's on that floor there's no

1090
00:43:12,539 --> 00:43:17,160
way they cleaned it very well in between

1091
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:19,259
the hour that we had they definitely big

1092
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:21,150
they don't they don't clean the remotes

1093
00:43:19,259 --> 00:43:23,640
that stuff bothers me they don't know

1094
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:26,099
any [ __ ] in the curtains but it looks

1095
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:28,319
okay to make it i yeah i don't know i

1096
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:30,930
just love hotels and i love room service

1097
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:35,069
and so like making a mess and not

1098
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:38,069
cleaning yeah I mean I think it's

1099
00:43:35,069 --> 00:43:39,299
because okay a little bit is that I

1100
00:43:38,069 --> 00:43:40,769
don't have to clean it because I'm the

1101
00:43:39,299 --> 00:43:41,849
type that once it's messy like I need to

1102
00:43:40,769 --> 00:43:43,319
clean it right away that's why I like

1103
00:43:41,849 --> 00:43:45,029
even when I'm hosting people I feel like

1104
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:47,069
I'm always cleaning the whole time yeah

1105
00:43:45,029 --> 00:43:48,960
because I want to stay clean but then

1106
00:43:47,069 --> 00:43:51,480
when I'm in a hotel I feel like it's

1107
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,779
okay because it's not my house but I

1108
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:56,369
don't really make it I get it I mean I

1109
00:43:54,779 --> 00:43:59,430
get the whole staycation thing for all

1110
00:43:56,369 --> 00:44:02,099
you couples out there if you can't get

1111
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:04,140
away for a long time well I don't know

1112
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:06,180
and I think you like it I don't know if

1113
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:08,670
everybody would like that well I think

1114
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:09,660
it's about making time to spend time

1115
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:10,589
together I mean for those of you guys

1116
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,989
who don't know we've been long-distance

1117
00:44:10,589 --> 00:44:14,999
for a really long time and Ryan works

1118
00:44:12,989 --> 00:44:16,739
365 days out of the year he worked on

1119
00:44:14,999 --> 00:44:19,499
his birthday he works on holidays he

1120
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:21,360
walks every single day this is work

1121
00:44:19,499 --> 00:44:25,330
bears work so he works

1122
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:27,190
and so if I'm like let's take a trip and

1123
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:29,080
let's go on a vacation I've done it

1124
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:31,180
really hard for him to take more than

1125
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:32,650
you know a couple days off and so

1126
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:35,530
staycations are better because then he

1127
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:38,470
only loses one workday or he can like

1128
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:41,740
today part of the staycation and then we

1129
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:43,420
work in the afternoon and so yeah but I

1130
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:45,970
also admire that about Ryan so I know

1131
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:48,970
this is not a full roasting session Ryan

1132
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:52,800
is very hardworking and that's one of

1133
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:55,120
the things that makes me like him so ya

1134
00:44:52,800 --> 00:45:00,090
know because all of a sudden I felt

1135
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:00,090
really shy let's talk about Paco now

1136
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:07,980
part of what Arden does for you is

1137
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:10,930
whenever you get into like a

1138
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:17,500
relationship of some sort let's not talk

1139
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:22,030
about don't listen he drops everything

1140
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:24,790
for a girl because when he is so in love

1141
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:28,240
but I'm telling you people that's the

1142
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:32,650
way to do it see yep you need balance

1143
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:36,460
let me defend myself no this is now

1144
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:37,450
roasting Paco time yep but I mean talk

1145
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:38,890
about it because I think that's very

1146
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:41,530
relatable for a lot of people especially

1147
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:43,810
people who I mean people don't date as

1148
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:46,350
much I feel like right dating is like

1149
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:48,850
happening less and less like I guess

1150
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:51,430
exclusive Rio date yeah real yeah not

1151
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:53,530
like tinder hookups yeah well I think

1152
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:56,110
the generation has just changed a lot

1153
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:58,390
and it's really weird because there's

1154
00:45:56,110 --> 00:46:00,430
just too many options and everybody is

1155
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:02,440
sort of always like one foot in one foot

1156
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:04,030
out or like always kind of look in that

1157
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:05,800
way in though does everybody I want to

1158
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:07,120
go mow they have fun right you don't

1159
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,650
want to commit and it's sort of like you

1160
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:10,210
go on a couple days but it's just like

1161
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:11,410
dinner or whatever and then you're like

1162
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:13,090
oh but let me see if I can meet somebody

1163
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:14,800
better yeah but I think that's why I

1164
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:16,690
like we work because we're both like old

1165
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,190
school and we're just kind of like you

1166
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:21,070
can take out school you're both old

1167
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:23,020
things but also like we're too lazy to

1168
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:25,660
like meet new people like we never did

1169
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:27,070
I've never had tinder coffee meets bagel

1170
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:28,810
any of those I don't even know which way

1171
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:30,910
to swipe and I don't think you've ever

1172
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:34,240
had that either mm-hmm oh I missed that

1173
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:35,089
you phase of no tinder weed that was a

1174
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,529
combination

1175
00:46:35,089 --> 00:46:37,789
yeah yeah we missed it and honestly

1176
00:46:36,529 --> 00:46:40,219
there's like a small part of me that's

1177
00:46:37,789 --> 00:46:42,170
like oh they could kind of be fun but

1178
00:46:40,219 --> 00:46:43,489
also it's very overwhelming and scary to

1179
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:46,160
think that you're just out there and

1180
00:46:43,489 --> 00:46:49,160
people can like just sway wait yeah you

1181
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:56,029
yes or no and it's just so like I know

1182
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:57,380
feels really unauthentic I'm sorry I'm

1183
00:46:56,029 --> 00:46:58,809
sorry no but I mean I have a lot of

1184
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:01,400
friends who found their soul mates on

1185
00:46:58,809 --> 00:47:04,190
those sites and so I think it's great if

1186
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:10,729
you match with the right type of person

1187
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:12,559
but back to Paco Paco just he just has a

1188
00:47:10,729 --> 00:47:14,809
big heart and I know you guys all think

1189
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:17,630
he's like nasty and that he's just cool

1190
00:47:14,809 --> 00:47:19,930
you guys audience they just probably

1191
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:29,569
think Paco is a mess but he's actually

1192
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:31,400
actually pretty sweet he's really sweet

1193
00:47:29,569 --> 00:47:32,960
and he anything he goes above and beyond

1194
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:35,239
and maybe a little too much so I always

1195
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,519
tell people like if you like someone or

1196
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:38,779
if you love someone your instinct it's

1197
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:40,460
like sort of give everything and do

1198
00:47:38,779 --> 00:47:42,109
everything but I always tell people like

1199
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:43,579
Paco you just kind of like reel it back

1200
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:45,440
a little bit oh no definitely like you

1201
00:47:43,579 --> 00:47:47,329
give too much too early no okay then

1202
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:51,289
it's like okay bye let me defend myself

1203
00:47:47,329 --> 00:47:53,390
then so about a year ago it was real bad

1204
00:47:51,289 --> 00:47:54,950
oh yeah I know yeah like I would ask

1205
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:56,269
heart in like all types of stuff and

1206
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:58,880
everything and I would be like going out

1207
00:47:56,269 --> 00:48:01,069
to LA all the time like for this girl

1208
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,749
and everything and I would just give way

1209
00:48:01,069 --> 00:48:03,829
too much and Arden was like like why are

1210
00:48:02,749 --> 00:48:05,710
you doing that you don't even know what

1211
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:08,569
this person likes you or anything like

1212
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:11,869
make them want to work for you type of

1213
00:48:08,569 --> 00:48:14,269
thing and it totally made sense and as

1214
00:48:11,869 --> 00:48:17,900
of recent like I I'm focusing on myself

1215
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:19,700
a lot more and when you start working on

1216
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,779
yourself and this is all things that I'm

1217
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,640
kind of like learning from you you know

1218
00:48:20,779 --> 00:48:26,809
so just to show you that I listen and I

1219
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:28,940
do know I'm so when you work on yourself

1220
00:48:26,809 --> 00:48:31,219
you make yourself the prize you make

1221
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:32,779
yourself important and other people will

1222
00:48:31,219 --> 00:48:34,160
see that and value that in you and

1223
00:48:32,779 --> 00:48:35,450
they're like oh I do want to like you

1224
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,460
know get to know this person like you

1225
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:38,420
know how are they so focused and passion

1226
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:40,729
is something that a lot of people

1227
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:43,700
respect and admire and find attractive

1228
00:48:40,729 --> 00:48:46,009
and you know I got a lot of passion good

1229
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:47,750
I like that you do listen sometimes see

1230
00:48:46,009 --> 00:48:49,940
and that's why I'm a lot better

1231
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:52,010
now I'm proud of you Paco and that is

1232
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:52,640
the basic relationship that you guys

1233
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:54,920
have had

1234
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:56,540
Paco coming to you you telling him the

1235
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,950
same thing him not listening and then a

1236
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:00,680
year later now you've kind of listened

1237
00:48:57,950 --> 00:49:01,970
yeah I'm a lot better now okay and for

1238
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:04,700
those of you guys out there yeah I feel

1239
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:06,560
like if you are you know wanting to date

1240
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:09,140
and get into a relationship I always say

1241
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:11,120
the best advice is love yourself know

1242
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:12,620
what you want and who you are and if you

1243
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:14,570
respect yourself somebody else will as

1244
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:15,980
well yeah but you also really have to

1245
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:17,930
love yourself I know it sounds silly a

1246
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:20,180
lot of people are searching for love

1247
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:22,370
what does that mean love yourself I

1248
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:24,560
think it just means you have to be at

1249
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:26,180
least semi happy with who you are like

1250
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,590
if you don't even like who you are how

1251
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:29,660
can you expect someone else to like you

1252
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:31,160
let alone love you so I think a lot of

1253
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:33,800
people jump into relationships to feel

1254
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:36,320
like they are loved and to fill this

1255
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,880
void but then what happens is you then

1256
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:40,730
put so much pressure on the other person

1257
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:43,400
to love you to this extent that isn't

1258
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:47,240
really capable for them to do on their

1259
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:49,340
own but I think when two people are you

1260
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:51,050
know adults and they kind of know who

1261
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:53,300
they are and they're balanced and they

1262
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:55,190
have this healthy view on themselves and

1263
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:56,150
life and they come together and they can

1264
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:58,490
hopefully have a balanced relationship

1265
00:49:56,150 --> 00:50:00,530
that makes sense yep what I've heard is

1266
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:02,210
like it's complimentary exactly instead

1267
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:03,890
of having somebody complete you where

1268
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:05,450
they're filling voids right you already

1269
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:07,670
you're like very secure and who you are

1270
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:09,530
and somebody makes your life better

1271
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:12,920
exactly but without them you're okay

1272
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:14,690
with them it's better so I want to know

1273
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,950
how you guys kind of compliment each

1274
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:18,410
other you know like you guys are you

1275
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:22,400
guys are similar but different and so

1276
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:23,570
similar it was so different yeah no but

1277
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,870
you're similar in the fact that you're

1278
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:28,610
both boring

1279
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:30,170
we are both boring I don't think I am I

1280
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:33,040
think I'm super interesting you're them

1281
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:38,780
are you serious you are the most

1282
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:41,300
predictable person I ever met get a hold

1283
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:43,010
of Ryan I know he's either pooping or

1284
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:45,440
playing video games sleeping or playing

1285
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:48,050
basketball it makes sense that's a lot

1286
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:50,510
of things like you just named that's a

1287
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:51,950
lot of things anyway I don't think I'm

1288
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:53,450
that boring but yeah we're very

1289
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:55,160
different she does a lot of things she

1290
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:59,150
has a tiny group of friend she has a

1291
00:50:55,160 --> 00:51:00,700
huge group of friends that I she has so

1292
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:03,039
many friends that I have

1293
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:04,900
such a hard time I mean I don't want to

1294
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:08,079
sound racist but a lot of them are Asian

1295
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:10,720
and and very like hard for me to

1296
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:12,970
remember like three different Jenn

1297
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,390
friends well that's that I think in your

1298
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:15,010
defense

1299
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:16,900
I understand I actually do have like

1300
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:19,029
seven friends named Jen so that's a

1301
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:20,950
little hard and two of them are Jenn

1302
00:51:19,029 --> 00:51:24,430
married to Ben so that's really

1303
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:27,700
confusing too well they're both Yujin

1304
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:30,130
right so Jenn in and they're both

1305
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:31,359
married to guys named Ben yeah so I get

1306
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:33,670
them mixed up a bit and they get

1307
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:37,359
offended yeah Jim and then gentry but

1308
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:38,410
you know it's fine I know so funny I

1309
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:41,470
didn't know that her last name was Jay

1310
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:45,130
yeah all right well thanks yeah so you

1311
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:46,269
hey you've even answer the question what

1312
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:47,769
do you like about her what do you like

1313
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:49,660
about her what do I like that was a

1314
00:51:47,769 --> 00:51:52,900
question no he looks so upset about that

1315
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:54,369
question took what do I like there's so

1316
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:56,170
many things he's like how dare you make

1317
00:51:54,369 --> 00:51:57,819
me pick one know what didn't know what

1318
00:51:56,170 --> 00:51:58,450
it was the that was the original

1319
00:51:57,819 --> 00:52:00,400
question

1320
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:02,380
yeah Paco is asking how we complement

1321
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,970
each other how we make things work and

1322
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:07,500
what you like I think you get me to do a

1323
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:10,029
lot of things that I don't want to

1324
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:11,710
initially initially but then it but then

1325
00:52:10,029 --> 00:52:12,910
it helps I think it helps because you're

1326
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:14,079
right I mean I think if you weren't

1327
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:17,140
around I wouldn't do a lot of these

1328
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:19,480
things that inspire me essentially even

1329
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:21,460
if even if it's not a good thing like

1330
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:24,250
something I don't want to do it'll still

1331
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:25,569
inspire me to create something yeah you

1332
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:29,880
know I think that there's a there's a

1333
00:52:25,569 --> 00:52:33,640
lot of that and learning to be more

1334
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:36,069
openly compassionate I think I think

1335
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:38,859
blacc naturally I always go logic I

1336
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:40,059
think you myself but I feel like yeah

1337
00:52:38,859 --> 00:52:43,509
and she's a feeling so we're so

1338
00:52:40,059 --> 00:52:45,069
obviously so I've learned to be more but

1339
00:52:43,509 --> 00:52:47,349
that's like a kind of normal

1340
00:52:45,069 --> 00:52:50,650
relationship that isn't normally no it's

1341
00:52:47,349 --> 00:52:52,119
not the girly feely I know you're saying

1342
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:54,190
but we're not like feely

1343
00:52:52,119 --> 00:52:56,559
but then that's a thing like we're

1344
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:58,119
different in the sense of like I'm not

1345
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:59,980
like the type of girlfriend that's like

1346
00:52:58,119 --> 00:53:01,480
we have to like talk every single day

1347
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:03,130
move to be together all the time I feel

1348
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:05,079
like always hold hands and be like we're

1349
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:08,019
not like that we're fine on our own

1350
00:53:05,079 --> 00:53:10,210
we're fine like with Ryan here working

1351
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:12,670
and me back home working or whatever we

1352
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:14,570
you know we balance that out but

1353
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:16,610
definitely yeah Ryan

1354
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:19,610
is much more logical well love languages

1355
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:21,800
that that helped us understanding how

1356
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:23,450
many is there by five love languages I

1357
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:26,900
love languages are very different yes

1358
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:30,080
Brian is just time and touch and then

1359
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:32,150
mine is probably gifts and acts of

1360
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:34,730
service and words of affirmation so

1361
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:36,770
we're literally the opposite yeah yeah

1362
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:38,600
so I think a first couple years was

1363
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:40,670
tough especially with the distance

1364
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:42,860
because we were always a little bit like

1365
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:45,890
missing each other like do we like each

1366
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:47,210
other do we not and so I think once we

1367
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:49,640
kind of figured that out and realized

1368
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:53,570
okay we're just - people right right I

1369
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:55,100
think Ryan is your happy even if we just

1370
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:56,360
spend time together if we're not doing

1371
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:59,480
anything yep

1372
00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:01,490
but I'm the type that's like we do

1373
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:03,080
things and you have to like see I think

1374
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:04,760
that's common in a lot of relationships

1375
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:07,310
I think a lot of couples can relate to

1376
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:08,630
but what helped us is talking about what

1377
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:11,090
we're talking about right now right I

1378
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:12,860
think that will help any relationship to

1379
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:14,600
know that because I didn't know that

1380
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:15,920
people I was just like white I don't

1381
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:18,320
understand how you don't understand me

1382
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,520
it was a lot of that before whereas I

1383
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,320
think what I learned from her is like

1384
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:23,780
people are just different like very

1385
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:26,390
different and it helps and it's

1386
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:27,620
interesting too because the thing that

1387
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:29,720
you guys probably don't know about Ryan

1388
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:31,100
is he has all these plans and he has all

1389
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:33,410
these ideas but he's not the type to

1390
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:35,000
sort of say it and he never says

1391
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:37,730
anything unless he's actually going to

1392
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,820
do it so if I was like let's say maybe

1393
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:41,240
year two in I'd be like hey let's go do

1394
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:43,280
this

1395
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:45,350
and he'd be like I don't know or I don't

1396
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,720
know if I can and in my mind I'm like

1397
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:49,460
dude just say like maybe you'll try or

1398
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:51,140
maybe we will butt in but later on I

1399
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:53,210
realized it's because he didn't want to

1400
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:55,940
say it and not do it because in his mind

1401
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:57,830
that's worse whereas I think for me I

1402
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:59,840
would be like no I just want to know

1403
00:54:57,830 --> 00:55:00,410
that you're making the effort if that

1404
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:03,770
makes sense

1405
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:07,400
yeah but yeah I mean and then to answer

1406
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:09,770
Paco's question with Ryan I like that

1407
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:13,490
he's so logical and he sort of like

1408
00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:15,410
helps me during your break together yeah

1409
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:16,850
yeah I think for me like I take on a lot

1410
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:19,520
of things I'm doing a lot of things all

1411
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:21,680
the time but in like the most simplest

1412
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,840
way he's really good about being like

1413
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:25,160
hey it's okay you have all these things

1414
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:27,530
you have to do today and then you got

1415
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:28,400
five new things to do but everything's

1416
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:30,049
gonna be okay

1417
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,270
let's take it one at a time and so he's

1418
00:55:30,049 --> 00:55:34,520
really good about like helping me sort

1419
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:35,779
of do that and like we play clash

1420
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,859
together and a lot of times I start

1421
00:55:35,779 --> 00:55:37,940
freaking out and I'm like oh my gosh

1422
00:55:36,859 --> 00:55:39,710
we're gonna lose we're gonna lose and it

1423
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:41,329
just I start putting cards down and then

1424
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:43,160
you'll be like normal people who don't

1425
00:55:41,329 --> 00:55:44,539
know it's a game you can play with two

1426
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,710
people he'll be like no we're okay we

1427
00:55:44,539 --> 00:55:47,779
still got this and then you like calm

1428
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:50,690
down and then we win and it's awesome

1429
00:55:47,779 --> 00:56:01,250
yeah it's just I think another big one

1430
00:55:50,690 --> 00:56:01,609
it's a perfect example I think you being

1431
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:06,770
like this

1432
00:56:01,609 --> 00:56:08,900
hey I think it'll help other people it's

1433
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:10,220
helping me but at the same time that's

1434
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:12,380
what I'm thinking that's why I think

1435
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:16,279
about you all the time was okay no it's

1436
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:18,650
even no anyway I think another good one

1437
00:56:16,279 --> 00:56:20,029
is like something that I think I never

1438
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:21,829
understood how people couldn't get over

1439
00:56:20,029 --> 00:56:24,230
is if something bad would happen to you

1440
00:56:21,829 --> 00:56:26,240
that day how you would linger on

1441
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:27,650
something and I always thought like what

1442
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,980
there's nothing you can do about that it

1443
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:32,329
happened like how can you improve it and

1444
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:33,859
versus like a lot of times she'll bring

1445
00:56:32,329 --> 00:56:35,210
me something like something bad will

1446
00:56:33,859 --> 00:56:37,130
happen to her she'll tell me all about

1447
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:39,200
it and instead of comforting her which

1448
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:40,460
my natural thing is I'm gonna solve the

1449
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,329
problem how do I stop this from

1450
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:44,420
happening in the future

1451
00:56:41,329 --> 00:56:45,890
that doesn't work guys and girls out

1452
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:49,460
there who are illogical that's mostly

1453
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:52,460
guys though mostly but it's mostly guys

1454
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:55,430
were factors so don't I had to learn the

1455
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:58,099
hard way like they just want a lot a lot

1456
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:58,670
of people just want compassion and not a

1457
00:56:58,099 --> 00:57:00,410
solution

1458
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:02,089
yeah even though I think the thing is

1459
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:04,339
and that's actually something that I do

1460
00:57:02,089 --> 00:57:06,559
appreciate about you too is that he

1461
00:57:04,339 --> 00:57:09,349
helps me get out of that like lingering

1462
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:12,200
faster but I think you have to first

1463
00:57:09,349 --> 00:57:14,059
approach it with compassion and then fix

1464
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:16,309
it like for example let's say like I

1465
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:17,990
trip a lot when I walk up the stairs but

1466
00:57:16,309 --> 00:57:19,400
sometimes like I would fall really hard

1467
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:24,079
and they might be bleeding and then Ryan

1468
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:25,640
would be like why did you do that okay

1469
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:26,750
there is definitely times and you're

1470
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:28,789
like why would you do well you know I'd

1471
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:29,690
be like what were you running because

1472
00:57:28,789 --> 00:57:30,200
I'm sorry thing like maybe you should

1473
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:32,630
stop running

1474
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:34,849
yes so like for the longest time I was

1475
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:35,500
like he's so mean but then later I

1476
00:57:34,849 --> 00:57:37,990
realize

1477
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:39,880
in his mind he's logically trying to fix

1478
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:41,560
me so that I no longer stop tripping

1479
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:45,190
because he's like why do you always trip

1480
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:47,470
he trips so much I mean I know it's not

1481
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:49,240
it's because my mind is faster than my

1482
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:50,560
climate like my life you know others and

1483
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:53,950
I'm thinking of other things and my legs

1484
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:56,440
just can't keep up I'm just like boy I'm

1485
00:57:53,950 --> 00:58:01,480
a lot realized sorry and a lot who's

1486
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:03,220
what I'm trying not to laugh he always

1487
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,660
laughs see that's why he cares about you

1488
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:06,970
yeah no no it's fine because I

1489
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:09,160
understand where it comes from but also

1490
00:58:06,970 --> 00:58:11,770
I mean I'm just this is like the most

1491
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:13,030
like basic example where now though he's

1492
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:15,700
really good about being like oh are you

1493
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:18,010
okay and then let's not do that anymore

1494
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:20,020
I don't say okay me but he doesn't say

1495
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:22,030
like that but he you know this well

1496
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:23,830
that's a very specific example that's

1497
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:25,450
just one example and I'm obviously this

1498
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:26,530
happens in like a lot of other things

1499
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:28,840
where like let's say something bad

1500
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:31,120
happens at work and I'm my days ruined

1501
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:32,980
but then he'll you know let me sort of

1502
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:36,100
vent through it and he'll be there but

1503
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:37,740
then very short after he'll point out

1504
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:39,820
things that are still positives and

1505
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:41,380
instead of me spending the rest of the

1506
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:44,110
day lingering on that and being upset

1507
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:46,840
I'll kind of be over it because he'll

1508
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:49,750
have helped me logically realize that

1509
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:51,640
hey there's really nothing I can do to

1510
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:54,100
control that moment in situation so

1511
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:55,120
let's not be sad forever so in a way it

1512
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,770
kind of helps that you guys have

1513
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,850
different perspectives because you

1514
00:58:56,770 --> 00:58:59,560
really need to each other and you can

1515
00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:01,630
see it in another way and because if not

1516
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:03,460
I would have never like if that happens

1517
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:05,170
to other people I would just give the

1518
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:06,970
logic like the solution versus like

1519
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:12,100
compassion like yeah you wouldn't have

1520
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:13,390
compassion robot I just think it's weird

1521
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:23,410
it's like you're missing this like

1522
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:26,920
compassionate DNA I'm super feely dude

1523
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:28,900
but you know Ryan's really sweet he's

1524
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:31,540
really sweet he's really sweet and

1525
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:34,120
what's crazy is that they're so sweet

1526
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:36,130
and he has such a big heart which is one

1527
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:38,200
of the things I love about him but he

1528
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:39,670
would never really let you know and

1529
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,440
he'll never take credit for it and does

1530
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:42,090
a lot of things for people you don't

1531
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,590
know

1532
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:45,170
yeah yeah so he's a type that would

1533
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:47,329
really

1534
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:48,260
ever want anyone to know yeah definitely

1535
00:59:47,329 --> 00:59:51,549
not one of those like youtubers that

1536
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:55,309
would go and like film the nice deed

1537
00:59:51,549 --> 00:59:57,799
done that before but we've also done

1538
00:59:55,309 --> 00:59:59,750
that though I'm telling it now we've

1539
00:59:57,799 --> 01:00:02,270
done I mean just growing up it was just

1540
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:05,960
like for fun yeah like it's not because

1541
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:08,119
I care okay alright so I guess are

1542
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:11,390
really not so sweet considering

1543
01:00:08,119 --> 01:00:12,589
everything it's so it's selfish I'm

1544
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:14,630
doing it cuz it makes me feel good

1545
01:00:12,589 --> 01:00:16,970
whether people know or not it's like you

1546
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:18,319
know I have extra bucks I'm gonna go to

1547
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:20,180
Walmart get a blankie or whatever and

1548
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:21,829
nothing to do in Hilo so we drive around

1549
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:23,660
and give homeless people blankets and

1550
01:00:21,829 --> 01:00:25,790
stuff it's not because I'm like hey

1551
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:28,130
let's film this it's because I'm bored

1552
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:30,619
yeah and it's something to do and it's

1553
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:31,220
not a bad thing in my mind and I feel

1554
01:00:30,619 --> 01:00:33,950
good about it

1555
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:36,470
so it's selfish yeah but it's different

1556
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:39,500
the unselfish byproduct a lot of things

1557
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:41,150
that we do that are everything for me

1558
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:43,430
like you know you mentioned earlier that

1559
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:45,319
I love you know meeting young people and

1560
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:47,869
helping people I love connecting people

1561
01:00:45,319 --> 01:00:49,609
but it's because I want to help people

1562
01:00:47,869 --> 01:00:53,839
but at the same time it makes me feel

1563
01:00:49,609 --> 01:00:54,859
good right yeah people need to

1564
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:56,750
understand that everything we do is

1565
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:58,430
first I have nothing it's it's fine

1566
01:00:56,750 --> 01:01:00,920
yes anything wrong with that yeah like I

1567
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:02,630
give Paco romance advice because I want

1568
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:08,599
to one day when he gets married be like

1569
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:13,369
hey yeah cuz of me I know and I'll do my

1570
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:14,930
girl or whatever or boy or boy whatever

1571
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:19,069
happens girl I support it all yeah yeah

1572
01:01:14,930 --> 01:01:20,780
I love you either way mm-hmm but I want

1573
01:01:19,069 --> 01:01:23,049
to go into something a little bit deeper

1574
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:23,049
now

1575
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:28,160
Brian is so exposed right now he's never

1576
01:01:25,819 --> 01:01:30,349
been this honestly not that deep maybe

1577
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:32,900
not that he just more I want to know

1578
01:01:30,349 --> 01:01:34,400
because you guys do have a long-distance

1579
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:36,770
relationship and we talked a little bit

1580
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:38,809
of about dating online and stuff and a

1581
01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:42,440
lot of times online dating is a lot of

1582
01:01:38,809 --> 01:01:44,900
long-distance at times so what made you

1583
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:46,760
know it worked for you guys like where

1584
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:49,220
did you guys compromise it you

1585
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:51,109
compromise out clearly you did but you

1586
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:53,780
know talk about it like what where in

1587
01:01:51,109 --> 01:01:58,099
your mind what did you have to give up

1588
01:01:53,780 --> 01:02:01,700
in order to make this work I did

1589
01:01:58,099 --> 01:02:04,910
I guess I'll start I had to change

1590
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:06,920
I live by habit and I follow the same

1591
01:02:04,910 --> 01:02:09,920
thing I normally do so you're boring and

1592
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:11,630
it's mean to some people but people who

1593
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,369
live like me understand this is what

1594
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:15,109
works and this is what I'm gonna stick

1595
01:02:13,369 --> 01:02:18,619
to so I have to disrupt my schedule and

1596
01:02:15,109 --> 01:02:20,690
to me that's a big thing it might not be

1597
01:02:18,619 --> 01:02:22,489
a big deal to other people but if you've

1598
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:25,430
done a thing a certain way for a long

1599
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:29,450
time and it works for you to change that

1600
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:31,999
is is see it sounds bad but it's a big

1601
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:34,220
deal to me it was a bishop like you're

1602
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:36,289
laughing it's true that's I mean I was

1603
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:39,529
dying because I just remember like year

1604
01:02:36,289 --> 01:02:41,150
one there is this time when like I was

1605
01:02:39,529 --> 01:02:42,680
like we never do anything and you were

1606
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:44,720
like we went to the grocery store

1607
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:46,970
yesterday and he was really proud of

1608
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:49,009
that yeah we left the house I would have

1609
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:51,259
normally just order things to come to me

1610
01:02:49,009 --> 01:02:52,729
right Ryan didn't leave his house for

1611
01:02:51,259 --> 01:02:59,150
like eight months guys before we start

1612
01:02:52,729 --> 01:03:01,239
that is not true yeah I do things you do

1613
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:03,380
more things now I do more things now

1614
01:03:01,239 --> 01:03:04,819
what people hit me out like hey do you

1615
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:05,869
think Ryan would do this I'm like dude

1616
01:03:04,819 --> 01:03:08,059
if you can get him out of the house

1617
01:03:05,869 --> 01:03:09,950
that's amazing are you talking [ __ ] to

1618
01:03:08,059 --> 01:03:11,719
people you know what though I've gotten

1619
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:13,369
pretty good at getting him out of the

1620
01:03:11,719 --> 01:03:16,430
house yeah well me because he cares

1621
01:03:13,369 --> 01:03:18,829
about you he L words you I came out for

1622
01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:24,559
your birthday party he did I surprised

1623
01:03:18,829 --> 01:03:26,119
me for my birthday no oh sorry no

1624
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:28,969
because you say go cuz I care about you

1625
01:03:26,119 --> 01:03:30,440
but I went to his birthday party oh and

1626
01:03:28,969 --> 01:03:32,839
you left the house for Jenna's birthday

1627
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:35,440
party you surprised her in LA - that was

1628
01:03:32,839 --> 01:03:35,440
a long time ago

1629
01:03:35,589 --> 01:03:40,999
mmm I just like being home yeah he does

1630
01:03:38,869 --> 01:03:42,739
he likes being home but yeah I would say

1631
01:03:40,999 --> 01:03:44,569
compromise is probably the biggest thing

1632
01:03:42,739 --> 01:03:46,130
and I think it works for us because

1633
01:03:44,569 --> 01:03:48,349
we're both really busy with what we're

1634
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:50,509
doing and because would she have

1635
01:03:48,349 --> 01:03:52,339
something going on I think long-distance

1636
01:03:50,509 --> 01:03:55,160
relationship is really hard when one

1637
01:03:52,339 --> 01:03:56,809
person is always waiting if that makes

1638
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:58,400
sense yeah if there's less that that

1639
01:03:56,809 --> 01:03:59,450
person because it's hard to if you're

1640
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,249
just waiting around it's hard to like

1641
01:03:59,450 --> 01:04:03,619
like oh why aren't you texting me like

1642
01:04:01,249 --> 01:04:05,569
every morning because you know if you're

1643
01:04:03,619 --> 01:04:07,640
working you probably don't have the

1644
01:04:05,569 --> 01:04:11,540
energy sometimes or you don't have the

1645
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:13,730
time and I think it's also understanding

1646
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:14,780
like there's definitely times when we'll

1647
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:16,580
talk a lot more

1648
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:18,560
maybe we'll FaceTime more maybe we'll

1649
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:20,930
you know hop on the phone a lot more but

1650
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:23,660
then there'll be weeks where we won't

1651
01:04:20,930 --> 01:04:25,280
talk much at all either because his work

1652
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:27,140
schedule is crazy or because mine is

1653
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:29,540
crazy but we have a mutual understanding

1654
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:30,830
knowing that that's okay and I think

1655
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:33,440
that's something I really appreciate

1656
01:04:30,830 --> 01:04:34,760
about Ryan because you know maybe five

1657
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,890
six years ago there was someone I was

1658
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:39,170
dating that when I'd be done filming and

1659
01:04:36,890 --> 01:04:41,600
I might have a 17-hour day on set

1660
01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:43,550
18-hour day on set where I literally am

1661
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:45,770
leaving set washing my face and hitting

1662
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:47,930
the bed so fast that don't even have

1663
01:04:45,770 --> 01:04:50,420
time to text goodnight and it sounds

1664
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:52,430
kind of selfish but just really tired

1665
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:53,810
and sometimes you don't want to talk but

1666
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:55,640
then that person would get really

1667
01:04:53,810 --> 01:04:57,530
irritated and upset not understand and

1668
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:59,810
not understand filming schedule or long

1669
01:04:57,530 --> 01:05:01,850
hours but Ryan gets that and so I think

1670
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:04,940
you know whenever something is busy like

1671
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:06,890
that I don't have to worry that oh no

1672
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:09,050
he's gonna be upset like because he's

1673
01:05:06,890 --> 01:05:10,970
not he gets it you know and if we make

1674
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:12,830
plans and it changes he's like alright

1675
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:14,660
that's cool I get it and I'm for sure

1676
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:16,580
filming in general I think it's it's

1677
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:18,710
really tough for the other person who's

1678
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:20,570
not in that industry if you're not in

1679
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:23,450
the entertainment industry to date

1680
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:25,460
somebody that is I think is it takes a

1681
01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:27,080
long time to get used to it I mean just

1682
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:29,120
the fact that like in me I had to even

1683
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:31,820
get used to you just kissing another guy

1684
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:34,040
on a show even though it's acting you

1685
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:35,120
know oh my hey you kissed somebody else

1686
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:36,920
too

1687
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:38,630
no I'm not saying I'm just yeah but I'm

1688
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:40,910
just saying you have to get used to it

1689
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:43,160
you have to understand like if you're

1690
01:05:40,910 --> 01:05:44,990
very open about it like that's there's

1691
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:46,520
there's other obstacles that most

1692
01:05:44,990 --> 01:05:48,590
couples don't have to go through right

1693
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:50,240
right and that is a big one and I'm sure

1694
01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:51,980
like it's not we're not the only ones

1695
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:53,630
that I mean if you had it's true you

1696
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:54,950
know but I will say for those of you

1697
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:56,810
guys out there if you run into that

1698
01:05:54,950 --> 01:06:01,310
situation I think kissing on camera is

1699
01:05:56,810 --> 01:06:03,020
really the most unintuitive ever felt

1700
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:04,910
intimacy kissing on camera which is

1701
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:06,200
really kind of sad to say when people

1702
01:06:04,910 --> 01:06:09,470
are like wow you guys have so much

1703
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:14,750
chemistry I'm always like well thank God

1704
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:16,460
we're good actors I literally I think

1705
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:17,780
I've always felt nothing and so and I

1706
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:19,370
think it's because you have 150 people

1707
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:21,020
staring at you you've got cameras in

1708
01:06:19,370 --> 01:06:22,370
your face you got what people think

1709
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:24,410
right and then it's always funny when

1710
01:06:22,370 --> 01:06:26,930
you see the most romantic shots and it's

1711
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:28,759
beautiful those are the ones that are

1712
01:06:26,930 --> 01:06:30,529
the most awkward because it's everything

1713
01:06:28,759 --> 01:06:32,509
slow and they're like move your hand

1714
01:06:30,529 --> 01:06:34,430
higher or lower turn your cheek turn

1715
01:06:32,509 --> 01:06:37,430
your face this way that way and it's so

1716
01:06:34,430 --> 01:06:38,990
awkward but then you know with sound and

1717
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:42,650
editing in lights they make it look good

1718
01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:45,319
and so one of the least romantic things

1719
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:50,119
and we I mean you know more than anyone

1720
01:06:45,319 --> 01:06:52,519
it's kissing in the rain oh yeah we've

1721
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:54,349
done a small version of that Oh a lot in

1722
01:06:52,519 --> 01:06:56,119
Teen Wolf yeah because people think it's

1723
01:06:54,349 --> 01:06:57,980
so romantic is in the notebook oh yeah I

1724
01:06:56,119 --> 01:07:00,500
would assume it is we had this scene

1725
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:05,150
where just so you guys know when you

1726
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:09,019
film with rain it's not like normal rain

1727
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:10,759
it's like pouring pouring water because

1728
01:07:09,019 --> 01:07:12,140
for it to catch on camera Oh Maureen you

1729
01:07:10,759 --> 01:07:13,460
can't see you can't see it so if you

1730
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:14,809
guys ever see like raining outside you

1731
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:17,599
just try to film it you really can't see

1732
01:07:14,809 --> 01:07:20,000
anything so then to replicate rain for

1733
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:22,579
fit for camera and for film they just

1734
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,900
just go crazy and I remember when we

1735
01:07:22,579 --> 01:07:25,460
would do these things running through

1736
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:27,500
rain by the time we even get to each

1737
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:29,210
other we just can't see and then we're

1738
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:31,339
kissing and then holding it for however

1739
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:33,109
long till they call cut I remember after

1740
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:35,119
every take we would just release and

1741
01:07:33,109 --> 01:07:38,000
both be spitting water on the ground and

1742
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:40,220
it was just like it was a gross but it

1743
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,619
looks romantic and awesome yeah that's

1744
01:07:40,220 --> 01:07:44,359
for was that Teen Wolf

1745
01:07:42,619 --> 01:07:46,220
yeah Teen Wolf we did that we kissed in

1746
01:07:44,359 --> 01:07:49,190
the rain a lot I feel like yeah there's

1747
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:52,009
a lot of rain rain that show is very

1748
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:54,259
much like it's more of a romance than

1749
01:07:52,009 --> 01:07:55,970
it's like yeah I would say it's like a

1750
01:07:54,259 --> 01:07:59,779
lot of romance a lot of action it's

1751
01:07:55,970 --> 01:08:01,779
really fun it's very dark but yeah

1752
01:07:59,779 --> 01:08:04,130
there's definitely a lot of romance and

1753
01:08:01,779 --> 01:08:07,069
they make it look good we had some

1754
01:08:04,130 --> 01:08:10,549
really great a great crew the great DP

1755
01:08:07,069 --> 01:08:11,900
made it look really nice that was um I

1756
01:08:10,549 --> 01:08:12,680
sent the video I said it wasn't my

1757
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:17,659
favorite show

1758
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:19,040
oh really they're like oh Ryan just

1759
01:08:17,659 --> 01:08:21,500
didn't like it because it like me

1760
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:23,060
kissing another guy well but we weren't

1761
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:24,889
even dating like that no no that wasn't

1762
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:29,089
the research oh that's not no I think

1763
01:08:24,889 --> 01:08:30,710
the show you're on now is great yeah

1764
01:08:29,089 --> 01:08:33,710
it's like well it's well-written not

1765
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:35,690
that Teen Wolf wasn't guys okay but I

1766
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:37,590
just I think it's not meant for me

1767
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:39,090
I think that's meant for more

1768
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:40,230
I mean I don't know if it is but I

1769
01:08:39,090 --> 01:08:42,150
thought it was meant for more for girls

1770
01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:46,710
or guys constantly have these beautiful

1771
01:08:42,150 --> 01:08:48,359

after me like at the Grove in LA are

1776
01:08:55,109 --> 01:09:02,010
like forties fifties women really yeah

1777
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:03,650
well that is uh I did not know that was

1778
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:07,859
I thought it was like 13 to 17 year old

1779
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:09,180
female girls yeah I think they more

1780
01:09:07,859 --> 01:09:10,320
excited for the boys yeah they're

1781
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:12,150
they're more excited for like dylan

1782
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:15,720
o'brien Tyler and like Cody you know

1783
01:09:12,150 --> 01:09:16,830
those guys yeah well I didn't realize

1784
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:18,840
how long we're going but we should go

1785
01:09:16,830 --> 01:09:22,380
into some questions actually some of

1786
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:26,340
those questions were so the biggest

1787
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:28,890
similarity was from CM see my Janice on

1788
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:31,050
Twitter yeah the question about long

1789
01:09:28,890 --> 01:09:35,430
distance relationships from Andrew Tran

1790
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:38,040
on reddit which one's did we do a little

1791
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:39,270
bit compromise know what do you think is

1792
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,950
the number one advice and what would you

1793
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:43,890
say to make it work long-distance

1794
01:09:40,950 --> 01:09:46,260
relationships it's hard to say because

1795
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:48,210
ours is such a weird thing you know so

1796
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:49,500
different from other people but I think

1797
01:09:48,210 --> 01:09:50,730
that's something important that every

1798
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:52,980
relationship needs to understand is that

1799
01:09:50,730 --> 01:09:55,560
your relationship Wow a relationship is

1800
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:57,530
unique in its own way and you need to be

1801
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:59,640
able to compromise and not be selfish

1802
01:09:57,530 --> 01:10:02,070
something that works for you won't

1803
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:06,540
necessarily work for me or are you yes

1804
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:10,230
became a weekly yeah I mean yeah I know

1805
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:13,530
it makes sense yeah but also well not

1806
01:10:10,230 --> 01:10:15,750
soft was super soft guys don't listen to

1807
01:10:13,530 --> 01:10:17,730
him I don't know what that was like

1808
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:19,230
people I just gotta keep my brand oh

1809
01:10:17,730 --> 01:10:21,090
that's all you know is that your brand I

1810
01:10:19,230 --> 01:10:22,590
don't know why is your brand like that

1811
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:25,230
what made you think that that was his

1812
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:27,030
defense mechanism mm-hmm I feel like

1813
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:28,770
that's what allows he's so emotional it

1814
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:29,550
doesn't matter who very emotional it's

1815
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:32,610
are they're more Twitter questions

1816
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:34,050
Twitter questions there were more but I

1817
01:10:32,610 --> 01:10:36,000
mean we don't have to state we don't

yourself then I guess that's it huh yeah

1853
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:15,360

1854
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:18,240
people how really bad you are with

1855
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:20,940
trends oh yeah you're like oh my gosh

1856
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:22,980
I'll be like wow babe have you seen this

1857
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:25,140
and he's like um that was a trend like

1858
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:27,450
two and a half years ago hey why do you

1859
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:35,760
always when you do my voice like um well

1860
01:12:27,450 --> 01:12:37,440
I text I see it like that no I don't I

1861
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:39,300
don't put enough emojis that's oh that's

1862
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:42,060
a good tip for those of you who are

1863
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:45,210
dating especially you guys out there an

1864
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:49,470
emoji will go a long way yeah a little

1865
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:51,900
smiley face would turn okay - okay just

1866
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:53,370
add the colon and parentheses and it

1867
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:57,090
changes everything

1868
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:59,820
are you mad no exclamation point happy

1869
01:12:57,090 --> 01:13:03,330
face everything it's like are you mad

1870
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:04,590
and it just no they are it's because

1871
01:13:03,330 --> 01:13:07,139
before that if

1872
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:09,030
or that if you are you mad will happen

1873
01:13:07,139 --> 01:13:11,489
if you don't put the emoji we have the

1874
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:12,810
emojis shows everything's fine I don't

1875
01:13:11,489 --> 01:13:14,400
know if that's just us but I think a lot

1876
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:15,810
if you date a guy that you think is

1877
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:17,310
always mad don't ask him if he's mad

1878
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:19,260
because he's probably never mad I

1879
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:22,830
learned that too later the hard way I'm

1880
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:24,570
not always appearing mad is that you're

1881
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:27,239
more see when you're smiling and you're

1882
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:34,139
happy it's great but it's a lousy social

1883
01:13:27,239 --> 01:13:37,920
you're so serious like too bad yeah good

1884
01:13:34,139 --> 01:13:39,659

1898
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:13,139
good yes can you say that you only have

1899
01:14:08,909 --> 01:14:14,880
two more well I mean I see no no I mean

1900
01:14:13,139 --> 01:14:17,580
I could maybe come back for Season five

1901
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:19,380
writers if you guys tweet to Chicago man

1902
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:21,239
that you love me that is true you

1903
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:21,630
actually do have to I mean those things

1904
01:14:21,239 --> 01:14:24,179
matter

1905
01:14:21,630 --> 01:14:26,730
Oh shows will keep you on if they know

1906
01:14:24,179 --> 01:14:28,080
that the audience likes you Wow and that

1907
01:14:26,730 --> 01:14:30,119
was on I think I think that was one of

1908
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:33,510
the reasons why your left Teen Wolf -

1909
01:14:30,119 --> 01:14:35,340
well I mean you stayed on oh yeah cuz

1910
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:36,960
they wanted you out earlier right yeah I

1911
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:41,060
think she was only supposed to be on for

1912
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:44,340
a few episodes we are sorry you're gonna

1913
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:46,230
cuz initially you weren't so it was a

1914
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:48,090
guess like my parents like a couple

1915
01:14:46,230 --> 01:14:49,590
episodes and then they extended it and

1916
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:51,960
then kept you went on to the next season

1917
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:54,389
Chicago med that's really lucky with

1918
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:56,550
Kyra - it was only supposed to be your

1919
01:14:54,389 --> 01:14:58,020
write a couple episodes but what they

1920
01:14:56,550 --> 01:15:04,080
kept her going and I think it's cuz the

1921
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:07,650
fans yeah they really like this all

1922
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:09,090

know YouTube is a lot of work you have

to wear every hat and so I think YouTube

1968
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:09,120
is so tough but it's definitely

1969
01:17:07,410 --> 01:17:11,430
