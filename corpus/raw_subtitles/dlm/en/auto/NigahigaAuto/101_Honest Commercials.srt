00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,720
hey guys so if you've been subscribed to

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,080
my channel for a while you know that i

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,080
make a lot of commercial

4
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,440
or infomercial spoons and the reason for

5
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,639
that is because i think so many of these

6
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,920
commercials are just so

7
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,280
irritating i mean they're already taking

8
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,559
you away from whatever it is you're

9
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,840
watching and most of the time they're

10
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,200
not even entertaining commercials are a

11
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,400
bunch of lies the only time they tell

12
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,520
the truth is at the very end of a

13
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,720
commercial when they're talking really

14
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,760
fast and you can't even understand them

15
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,119
anyway kind of like what i'm doing right

16
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,640
now i guess for example you know like at

17
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:31,840
the end of a toy commercial for kids

18
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:31,840
they're always like

19
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,719
you mentioned in this commercial

20
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,920
satisfaction not guaranteed batteries

21
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,040
not included or like medicine

22
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,239
commercials they always have those quick

23
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,760
disclaimers that have all the side

24
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,960
effects of the medicine at the very end

25
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,239
and sometimes it's even worse than what

26
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,280
the medicine is supposed to cure

27
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,039
you could bring this opportunity against

28
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,239
hiv stds or pimps if you experience

29
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,200
nausea heartburn and headaches vomiting

30
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,559
dizziness loss of sight diarrhea

31
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,360
gonorrhea sangria or even death contact

32
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,320
your doctor because he

33
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,440
may not be right for you and we are not

34
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,320
liable batteries not included but more

35
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,760
than anything that i hate about

36
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,039
commercials is probably the subliminal

37
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,320
messaging in it you know like in every

38
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,879
shampoo commercial they use these

39
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,640
beautiful

40
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,600
perfect girls with flawless hair using

41
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,039
their products because they want to put

42
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,640
in the back of your head that if you use

43
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,840
their product you'll end up looking like

44
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:12,960
that i mean come on would you buy a

45
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:16,000
shampoo if the commercial look like this

46
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,600
hairball essences batteries not included

47
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,960
probably i'd probably still get that one

48
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,479
but you get the point most commercials

49
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,000
are just not honest because this is what

50
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:27,840
commercials would really look like if

51
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,840
they were

52
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,840
laughs

53
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,399
what do you think he's on this time i

54
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,399
don't know shrooms

55
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,840
pepsis

56
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,479
he drinks beer not because it tastes

57
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,000
good but because all his friends do he's

58
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,840
quick to make decisions

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,200
that he would later regret he wakes up

60
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,119
like a new person

61
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,920
that has a headache and nausea all day

62
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,640
he is the most average man in the world

63
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,160
i don't always drink beer but when i do

64
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,280
i prefer not to

65
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,280
stay sober my friends

66
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,160
a delicious hot juicy 75 grams of fat

67
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,680
less than 875 calories fries dripping

68
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,520
with oil and probably some sweat from

69
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,800
the guy cooking them in a 32 ounce cup

70
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,800
of soda that could be enough for a

71
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,480
family in africa you'll feel so full

72
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,080
you won't even want to move thanks to

73
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,920
the all-new angus cheddar cheese

74
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,200
big whopper maca meal burger we know

75
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,040

76
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,360

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,360
order

78
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:52,720

equipped with a neighborhood waking

82
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,720
exhaust system and a working engine

83
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,480
light that will come on for no reason

84
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,400

85
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,720

hello i'm the spokesperson for gecko

90
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,879
insurance or should i say spokes gecko

91
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,239
i have nothing to do with car insurance

92
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,440
a comedy for that matter in fact i think

93
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,360
the only reason why i'm here is because

94
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,000
the comedy name is similar to gekko

95
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,840
seems quite lazy if you ask me gekko in

96
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,120
15 minutes you could spend 15 percent

97
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,840
more time than we did writing this

98
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,840
commercial

99
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,640

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,080
i'm not going to do this one this is not

106
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,840
cool damn voiceover

107
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,360
don't you point it over charlie won't

108
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,159
you dare point at me don't come over

109
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,439
don't you point it

110
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:06,159
out that [ __ ] charlie oh

111
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,159
charlie

112
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,959
what's great about the iphone you can do

113
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,079
this and this

114
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:19,280
and this and the and

115
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,280
you can hold on

116
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,840
hey oh oh

117
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,120
introducing the new iphone it's okay if

118
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,479
you drop it because the next one's

119
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,040
probably coming out a month after you

120
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,040
get this one

121
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,639
with bouncy's new rip in half there's

122
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,400
now 100 more sheets per row because you

123
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,040
can now take a half sheet instead of a

124
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,600
full one

125
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,520
because when you're at your worst bouncy

126
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,440
is like a purse

127
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,759
you know because it you know because it

128
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,120
holds things and it picks stuff up and

129
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,600
charlie this one doesn't make sense

130
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,600
either man

131
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,680
all right so maybe i exaggerated some of

132
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,960
these anyway thank you guys so much for

133
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,600
watching i know i haven't done one of

134
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,759
these

135
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,960
type of rants or like off the pill type

136
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,400
of things you know where i get really

137
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,280
upset about something and talk about it

138
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,280
really fast i

139
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,720
i just hate to see people getting

140
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,320
tricked i hate when people are not

141
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,080
honest and commercials are just the

142
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:18,000
worst thing i could ever think of

143
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:25,840
bobbleheads new shirts

144
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,840
different colors that's not my merch

145
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,000
do it
