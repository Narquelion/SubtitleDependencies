3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,540
to film today and hopefully post the

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,070
video by tomorrow which we all know is

5
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,790
Friday okay so that joke got old fast

6
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:14,040
that was supposed to be like you know

7
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,670
like a fast you know like it like a fast

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,910
car

9
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:22,470
some like Dobb lurry thank science

10
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:24,630
anyway so as I was saying until I saw

11
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,070
rudely interrupted my hai itself I was

12
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,840
gonna film today but I needed a costume

13
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,609
and that costume was gonna be delivered

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,500
to me but sadly that didn't happen I

15
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,840
don't want to point any fingers or name

16
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,110
names names so let's just call this

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,489
company FedEx I paid for the X extra

18
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,110
money just so they could overnight it to

19
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:41,520
me and three days later I still don't

20
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,840
have it which honestly wouldn't have

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,059
been that bad if they would at least let

22
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,010
me know but no I tracked it and it said

23
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:50,640
it was coming so I waited I waited by

24
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:54,210
the window like like a dog were a badass

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,620
dog I need to woke up extra early just

26
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,300
so that I could receive the box myself

27
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,530
because apparently if you don't answer

28
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,090
the door they're just gonna leave your

29
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:04,080
package underneath your welcome mat no

30
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,070
matter how big the packages and I'm

31
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,450
sorry I don't want to sound like a

32
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,280
complainer but I'm just fed up with

33
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,610
FedEx next time I'm just gonna use a

34
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,080
different delivery service like UPS but

35
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,189
really the real reason why this upset me

36
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,750
so much is because I've been trying to

37
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,150
post videos more frequently for you guys

38
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,470
and I put so much time into planning and

39
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,420
making sure this video would go out by

40
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:24,240
this weekend but sadly you're stuck with

41
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,619

42
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,450
