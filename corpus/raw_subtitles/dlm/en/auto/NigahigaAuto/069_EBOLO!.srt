1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,629
hey guys so I feel like I tell you guys

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:08,550
the same thing every single month but I

3
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:10,740
am once again sync with um just kidding

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,870
is probably just Ebola fever bola Ebola

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,280
fever hold up speaking of Ebola it might

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,839
the only one that before you found out

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,550
what it was you pictured about like a

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,260
snake and that's probably because it

9
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,990
sounds like ball like a ball constrictor

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,519
or like boy the k-pop star yep

11
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,510
ten seconds in already off topic as you

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,039
can probably see it's gonna be one of

13
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,869
those videos not even because of my ADHD

14
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,340
this time it's because I'm a little

15
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:30,779
delirious from the medication but I'm

16
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,160
still gonna make the video anyway I'm

17
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:34,230
sorry I really shouldn't be making any

18
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,270
bullet jokes but honestly I really did

19
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,950
think like legitimately thought that I

20
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,750
had it like about a week ago about a

21
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,100
week ago did that come on I'm not gonna

22
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,450
lie to you guys a couple weeks ago I got

23
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,100
back from out of country and I got

24
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,020
really sick I was getting really bad

25
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,430
headaches and nausea and like stomach

26
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,899
aches and for some reason I just kept

27
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,700
sneezing and coughing up blood all the

28
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,379
time I wasn't gonna reverse vampire I

29
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,489
was just like spitting out blood it was

30
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,230
bad but it turns out it was just a

31
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:56,910
really bad sinus infection but at the

32
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,350
time I thought I was dying so naturally

33
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,670
I was a little paranoid and it didn't

34
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,680
help that everybody on Facebook and

35
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,969
Twitter was talking about how Ebola is

36
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,619
gonna have an outbreak and stuff like

37
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,420
that so just like any other paranoid

38
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:08,189
person I did what you're not supposed to

39
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,970
do and I just googled my symptoms and

40
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:13,650
guess what pops up not Ebola but some

41
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,640
other random illnesses that don't really

42
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,770
matter because they're not in the news

43
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,479
right now but when I googled Ebola guess

44
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,780
what happened guess what I saw under the

45
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,460
symptoms list did not match up with my

46
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,920
symptoms completely probably not even

47
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:29,189
half but I knew for sure that I had

48
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,500
Ebola keep in mind I was very delirious

49
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,000
and sick and super jet lag so I honestly

50
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,740
did believe that I had and just like

51
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,659
anyone else who believe they're infected

52
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,740
with a deadly virus I did exactly what

53
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,990
you would think to do in that scenario

54
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,759
not go to the doctor and make a video

55
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,500
about it instead hence this but

56
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,780
fortunately as you can tell I got a lot

57
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,159
better but just the scare of thinking

58
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,079
that you might have Ebola or anything

59
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,850
else that's deadly makes you think a lot

60
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,990
deeper and that's exactly what I did it

61
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,430
actually helped me come up with a new

62
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,520
model to live by I used to be all about

63
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,229
that Yolo life Yolo right you only live

64
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,759
once Oh live life to the fullest it's a

65
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,869
good message but come on we all know you

66
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,490
all know this out nobody says that

67
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:03,990
anymore and so news I probably said it

68
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,310
more times in this video so far than

69
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,180
people have said it today in the world

70
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,800
now here's a brain

71
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,149
Newmont straight out of a sick person's

72
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,720
head it's called it's none other than

73
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:14,190
welcome to this is gonna well this I'm

74
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,320
trying to think of a epic way to

75
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,370
announce what the word is but it's

76
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,800
already in the title you guys know it

77
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:23,550
it's Ebola its bolo it's Ebola everybody

78
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,350
only lives once right it's a completely

79
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,700
new and unique motto okay it's literally

80
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,260
saying the same thing but the meaning is

81
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,420
completely opposite of Yolo everybody

82
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,040
only lives once so be careful don't live

83
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,930
life to the fullest that's dangerous

84
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,700
live life to the safest nothing that

85
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:42,209
Yolo nonsense Yolo will get you killed

86
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:44,070
but Ebola will keep you alive meet

87
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:45,570

and now little Shaunie is a little gonee

95
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:12,130

00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,959
and said he bore loans too dangerous to

97
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,819
drive it out seatbelt the meteor would

98
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:17,220
have missed him and you'd still be alive

99
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:20,530
today

100
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:22,209

101
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,970
he's being peer pressured to drink

102
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:26,860
marijuana drugs and come on deck our

103
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,660
cookies are doing it but what Derek

104
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:32,250
doesn't know is that he's about to make

105
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,250
the biggest mistake of his life

106
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:46,090
Yolo Derek more like dead Rick

107
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:50,050
if only Derek made the right choice and

108
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,730
said nah man the drug lord who had his

109
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,860
marijuana drugs stolen would not have

110
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,680
sent his pet rhinoceros after Derek and

111
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:59,170
he'd still be alive today

112
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,450
moving on this is morally he's a dog so

113
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:06,489
he can't even say the word Yolo which is

114
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:08,890
why Marley is more living last but not

115
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:10,930

actually thinks he has Ebola

118
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,209
Ryan is debating if he should make a

119
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,669
video of all his experience or go to the

120
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:20,079
doctor should probably go the doctor but

121
00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:21,940
what Ryan doesn't know is that he's

122
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,710
about to make the biggest mistake of his

123
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,830
