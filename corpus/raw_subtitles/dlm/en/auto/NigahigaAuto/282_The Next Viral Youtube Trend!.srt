00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:11,849
finally be on to something guys you're

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,410

three days now actually it's been four

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:19,260
days and you just see the text at the

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:21,420
beginning of the anyway why does this

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,220
Melanie yes most like piss I mean I've

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,670
been literally working non-stop so it

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,260
probably is Oh

11
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,570
pulp pulp is good for you dude

12
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,600
wait why doesn't mind have any pulp in

13
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,160
it anyway guys I think I might finally

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,239
be on soda is this all about it

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,590
finding the next big thing on the

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,270
Internet you know I'm sick of always

17
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,700
being late on those stupid trends like

18
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,559
planking or those coning videos in fact

19
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,730
I think I only recently just saw that

20
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:52,379
nan cat video isn't 9 K I think it's

21
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:53,760
nyan nyan yeah yeah anyway I think I

22
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,110
just figured out how to find the next

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,879
big thing on the internet can't really

24
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,920
predict that it just has to happen oh

25
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,449
yeah remember Aaron Carter the teenage

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,890
heartthrob when we were kids I guess

27
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:03,629
it's just a coincidence that his brother

28
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,850
Nick Carter was in the infamous

29
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:08,159
Backstreet Boys the rival band NSYNC

30
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,869
which consisted of who Justin Timberlake

31
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,700
one of the biggest stars even till today

32
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:14,100
who was even bigger than him right now

33
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,720
someone with the exact same name Justin

34
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,759
me and just when we thought no one could

35
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,150
possibly compete with Justin Bieber boom

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,790
I've just been gamers all in one

37
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:25,770
direction you see now they're all

38
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,960
connected I mean I guess 'sir kinda

39
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,270
connected but it's kind of a strand I

40
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,189
thought you'd never ask

41
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:33,990
what oh I thought you were gonna you

42
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:36,869
know ask cops as relevant to the video

43
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,280
and I thought you never asked you

44
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:40,020
remember the evolution of dance one of

45
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,579
the first viral videos of all time and

46
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,159
he just so happened to dance to the song

47
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,689
baby got back time

48
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,100
the most popular things on the internet

49
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,289
such as dancing baby laughing baby

50
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,450
serious baby babies babies babies oh

51
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:52,799
that's why Justin Bieber many considered

52
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,110
a baby at the time that was always this

53
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,000
very person single baby featuring

54
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,439
ludacris which just so completely borrow

55
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,399
and what word is said more than any

56
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:02,280
other word in that song

57
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,079
baby baby baby which brings us to more

58
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,939
babies except a little bit older now in

59
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,679
charge of my fan totally became a

60
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:09,390
memorable name especially after Charlie

61
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:11,039
the Unicorn and who believed in unicorns

62
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,170
people on drugs but not just any people

63
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,720
on drugs babies on drugs which brings us

64
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,280
to David after the dentist what are you

65
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,989
need to go to the dentist's for bad

66
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,150
teeth deeply pachuco not just any

67
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:22,380
chipmunk the dramatic speaking of

68
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,610
dramatic of course you remember one of

69
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,040
the most dramatic videos of all time

70
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,090
leave Britney Alone by Chris Rock which

71
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,220
just so happened to be a crossdresser

72
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,840
just like Liam Kyle Sullivan and oh my

73
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,489
god shoes the borrowed music video that

74
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,810
was so fun to watch but making a little

75
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:35,910
bit irritating kinda like the superstar

76
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,049
sensation known as French speech that's

77
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,430
not the character with a super

78
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:41,069
high-pitched voice almost as high as

79
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,799
that sneeze from ceasing peasant at you

80
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:46,200
more like blessed shoes which brings us

81
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:48,299
to wait we already did that one so you

82
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,400
must be thinking ah here it goes again

83
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:51,959
the spectacular music video ok go

84
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,150
dancing on treadmills which everyone

85
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,890
uses when they're on a diet coke and

86
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,510
mentos and who would have done that such

87
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,250
a simple couple mix together we create a

88
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,139
closet I probably quit buying everyone

89
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,819
like chocolate ring once again a fire

90
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,709
busy video where the artist K Sunday

91
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:06,330
says the phrase Chocolate Rain a total

92
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:08,700
of 48 times

93
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:11,190
now this is where it gets tricky 48 no

94
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,510
try for da it's a simple math equation

95
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,150
really the forwards of D obviously

96
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:18,990
meaning DAP is in deaf hands are harder

97
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,820
better faster in the song totals 56 and

98
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:24,540
what's the difference between 56 and 48

99
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:28,770
that's right eight you see for D eight a

100
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:31,140
lot of charm thanks Nick no problem in

101
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:36,090
and well that's all I got so far

102
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:37,860
dang so close you do know this doesn't

103
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,680
make sense wait we'll see that again

104
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,810
what then you don't really make sense no

105
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,170
what you did before that you just sighs

106
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:48,000
so don't you get it psy Gangnam style

107
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,680
the most viewed video of all time right

108
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,520
now that's the next connection that

109
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,810
doesn't make any sense

110
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,110
well doesn't it because I think it's

111
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:57,930
simple it's easy as ABC ABC one two

112
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:00,330
three exactly 123 the National pokedex

113
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,850
number for the bug Pokemon Scyther

114
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:04,740
there's your proof proof of what tell me

115
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:06,690
just connected the very last and biggest

116
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,880
trend today okay even if I did believe

117
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,500
your crazy theory what about the Harlem

118
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,790
shake that only lasted a week and it

119
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,810
doesn't count anybody that did that

120
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:18,180
trend is probably an idiot so what's

121
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:21,090
that for sigh then I don't know well I

122
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,940
