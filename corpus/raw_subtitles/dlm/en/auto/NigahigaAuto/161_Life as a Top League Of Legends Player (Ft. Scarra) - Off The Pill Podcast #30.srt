housemates I mean obviously you live

46
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:46,580
with a bunch of other gamers we should

47
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:49,070
introduce you first for people who don't

48
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:50,509
know SCARA is originally you started

49
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:53,450
doing playing league right you were like

50
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:55,550
professional eSports I was as a

51
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:57,740
professional league of Legends player

52
00:01:55,550 --> 00:02:00,770
for two or three years then I

53
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:03,979
transitioned to being a coach for six

54
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:05,630
months and then afterwards I would and

55
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:09,710
in between I was I've been a streamer

56
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:11,090
for about seven to nine years Wow

57
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,530
I'd have to really double check because

58
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:16,910
I didn't start streaming on Twitch I

59
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:19,190
started Amy on Xfire and exactly you it

60
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:22,190
was like it's such a stuffed program you

61
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:24,140
had a cap of 50 people so like if you

62
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:27,050
hit your cap people have to wait in a

63
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,600
queue so people at someone left to watch

64
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:32,360
the stream and so I used to stream water

65
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,459
Warcraft Arena on Xfire to Kappa 50

66
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,540
people like way back when and then you

67
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:38,360
always filled out your cap

68
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,850
yeah yeah I was actually really good and

69
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,290
the funniest thing is like I was I was

70
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:44,300
like one of the top rate players on my

71
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:45,590
battlegroup I could never get ranked one

72
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,099
and the reason I could never get ranked

73
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,349
one

74
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:50,930
it's cuz hospice team was so good she's

75
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:52,340
just like actually just beat the [ __ ]

76
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,290
out of my team until we got like the

77
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,079
moralize we hate her quit the game I was

78
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:59,239
like I see was like her team is way too

79
00:02:57,079 --> 00:03:00,889
good like oh he had like yeah she was a

80
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:02,689
really good druid she had a really great

81
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:04,519
warrior she had a really great warlock

82
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:06,079
and they had like literally like some of

83
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:08,329
the best players in our battle group on

84
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:09,799
the team it'll she's actually building

85
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:12,319
an impostor and and the funny thing is

86
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:17,319
now you're doing your streaming TFT yes

87
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,319
which is team fight tactics yes it is I

88
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:23,389
don't know it's like a game bride game

89
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,829
just kinda yeah yeah it's a strategy

90
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:26,000
game right okay

91
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,469
actually the best I found the best way

92
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,870
to describe it it's a deck building game

93
00:03:27,469 --> 00:03:34,189
it's a building it's a strategical deck

94
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:36,169
building game with I guess gambling

95
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:37,969
elements it's got to be one of the more

96
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:39,349
I mean I don't know if it's I haven't

97
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:41,389
checked recently but is it more popular

98
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:43,159
than fortnight yet on Twitch hell no for

99
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:44,870
days but it still it's one of the bigger

100
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:46,549
ones right I will the tribute it to

101
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,810
something like it's like hearthstone you

102
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:48,980
know okay and so it's something that

103
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,810
like there was a lot of crazy around

104
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,220
there before and unless it's probably

105
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,540
it's died down by now and unless they do

106
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,189
something big like it's probably this

107
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,379
day like at a good level for like a

108
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:58,639
couple years right and that's so

109
00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:00,889
interesting you put all this time into

110
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,780
learning this like skill and this art

111
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:04,340
and it could you you have to adjust

112
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,769
right like you can't just play the same

113
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,049
game well League I guess I play League

114
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:10,340
for like 7 years actually so I never

115
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:12,590
thought I'd switch and then just

116
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:15,650
randomly like I went in to play this

117
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:16,849
game okay I actually got was getting

118
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,870
tired of League for the first time in

119
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:20,000
seven years Wow

120
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,259
so I started playing dota Auto chess I'm

121
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,699
like I'm in my stream I actually had

122
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:24,349
these where I played more all the chests

123
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:27,440
that played League of Legends and this

124
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:32,060
is the five months following TFTs launch

125
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:34,099
and then one day I got a invite from Rai

126
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,270
games super 8 dat like we need we want

127
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:38,419
you to come in and test our game I'm

128
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:39,530
just like okay mm-hmm they even say it

129
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:41,509
was a game you like we need you to test

130
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,800
something confidential but through Mike

131
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:44,960
did a great provide that new was a game

132
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,610
so much I woulda died and they were

133
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,070
making their own daugther auto chest

134
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:51,139
which is the the first iteration of the

135
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:53,360
genre uh-huh and it turns out that like

136
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:55,159
as I was trying to escape ride games

137
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,870
like the clutches of Riot Games to play

138
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:59,389
other different games they just dragged

139
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,370
me back in so then I became like one of

140
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:02,110
the faces 40ft

141
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,430
and like a lot of my success is

142
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,530
attributed to me jumping on the

143
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:08,199
bandwagon first right right so they were

144
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:13,060
very supportive of your career then you

145
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:15,040
say or I mean yeah right like I was a I

146
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,449
was a streamer for illegal edges that

147
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,380
became a top seaman for the new game

148
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:22,150
like I was actually like I okay I was I

149
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:25,210
was almost a consultant for them at some

150
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,949
point I felt because it's like when we

151
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,810
we they have like a chat room with all

152
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:31,510
the the alpha testers and we talk a lot

153
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,100
about the game but even then like I at

154
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,560
some point had to figure out if the game

155
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,449
was worth like all any on and what ended

156
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,160
up happening was when they first invited

157
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:41,080
me to that meeting and like everyone

158
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,970
else else ended up leaving I sat down

159
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,430
with the devs for like two hours after

160
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,690
hours like we're literally eating in the

161
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,100
dinner room i sat down for two hours and

162
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,150
talked to them not just about the game

163
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,740
like the future they gave my talk to

164
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,060
what's your distribution plan like

165
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,350
what's your like how are you guys gonna

166
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,060
make money what's the future of your

167
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:57,520
game what's expansion look like Wow

168
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,810
everything I heard about from talking

169
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,190
with them I was like these guys that are

170
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:02,590
intelligent they know what they want to

171
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:04,419
do they can enact change quickly and

172
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:06,550
like I really like these guys and so I

173
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:08,200
all end on the premise that I like the

174
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,789
people working on it more than the

175
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,950
premise of I like the company or like

176
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:13,539
anything about the game get interesting

177
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,889
because the first the first iteration of

178
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:17,139
the game we got was like yeah potential

179
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:19,030
but it's like man honestly it was it

180
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:22,210
wasn't as good and even now I should

181
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:25,450
credit you yeah you pretty much helped

182
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:27,910
develop it like I do anything about the

183
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:30,010

199
00:06:55,539 --> 00:07:00,010

from yeah we've known each other for a

202
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,870
while now because that's sighs I mean

203
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,460
clearly you know something I don't know

204
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:10,180
we don't know her like me and David's so

205
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:13,699
yes I I've met Paco

206
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:18,229
four years ago four years ago I saw I

207
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:20,389
started offline TV which is like a group

208
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:22,460
of how do I even see like a gamer yeah

209
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:26,659
this is actually a gamer house but like

210
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:34,190
streamers house and we didn't fail it's

211
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:37,250
like there's so many like there's been

212
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:39,139
like a lot of streamers yes yeah that

213
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,520
been growing up and that like we were

214
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:43,460
the ones that are able to kind of

215
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:46,219
succeed in a formula I have no idea how

216
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,810
like essentially I brought together a

217
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:49,879
lot of people that wanted it's so funny

218
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:52,729
actually at the origin story was like I

219
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:55,219
had a version me and like no manager

220
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:57,050
Chris and I had an Excel document I was

221
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:58,819
like in this dock me I'd the people I

222
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:01,250
wanted to work with like in the house

223
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:02,599
and so like like pokies name was on

224
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,340
there which it we eventually got her

225
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:06,349
toast is on there but I was like oh

226
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,659
toast wasn't even on there it was so

227
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:10,490
early I didn't Lilly Picchu one of the

228
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:11,840
people who live live was a lives with us

229
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,460
is on there and I was like there's

230
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,960
nobody can get her she's too big so I

231
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,789
like crossed her out and like we didn't

232
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,650
even try to get her like the first the

233
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:20,360
first couple people we got but like we

234
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:22,009
end up grabbing a lot of content

235
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,620
creators it's been I think about two and

236
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:26,120
a half years since we started all of us

237
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,029
are doing pretty well like it's been

238
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,479
pretty successful and where was I going

239
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:32,060
with this

240
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:34,130
there's oh yeah I met him because pocket

241
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:36,800
tiger came over a long time ago and I

242
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:38,930
think me before that actual house yeah

243
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,909
was even like created it was one you

244
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:42,829
know the base unit that's why it was

245
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:45,560
grabbing food a couple of oh yeah so so

246
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:49,220
I use are I still have a friend sorry

247
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:51,260
they used to name Orlando and then I met

248
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,699
him through Orlando and then what's so

249
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,470
funny when we're starting off off off

250
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:58,130
off line we were just like how do we

251
00:08:54,470 --> 00:09:02,750
make cool stuff and then he drove over

252
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:04,730
to try to help us do school stuff we

253
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,470
still have he was one of the first

254
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,510
people to film our very first skit ever

255
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,740
Wow and that was the reason why we don't

256
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:13,550
do skits anymore because we're just

257
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:16,519
awful actors actually like the worst

258
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:18,500
footage I really want to see I don't

259
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:20,990
even know how to find it like I'm pretty

260
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:23,059
sure it's hidden somewhere like we our

261
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:25,099
first ever skin was done with pakhi Oh

262
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:27,409
that's when we learned that streamers

263
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:29,299
are not actors or actresses and that we

264
00:09:27,409 --> 00:09:31,759
probably do a little bit better with

265
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:34,969
improv and like set scenarios than just

266
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:37,009
like hey let's read off lines oh [ __ ] we

267
00:09:34,969 --> 00:09:38,539
can't read off lines well I mean it's

268
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:41,629
kind of a we do I mean we have lines but

269
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:44,449
we'll improv it yeah a lot of times you

270
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:45,379
can tell you that huh I said see what

271
00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:47,959
makes you feel comfortable

272
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:50,899
yeah yeah okay so basically you guys met

273
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:52,579
but before that story in it because like

274
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:54,529
you have to tell me the story from that

275
00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:56,719
point because I am not even sure I

276
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:59,119
remember the first time I met you it was

277
00:09:56,719 --> 00:10:00,109
at Korean barbecue okay but we kind of

278
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:02,779
just talked about because I was very

279
00:10:00,109 --> 00:10:05,329
curious to like your backstory and how

280
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:08,059
you kind of got into league how you

281
00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:09,859
became a team with Dignitas all that

282
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:11,869
stuff okay guys are like you oh boy like

283
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:13,669
you you want my life story from what I

284
00:10:11,869 --> 00:10:17,269
got was just interesting because it was

285
00:10:13,669 --> 00:10:20,229
a gamble you know in a way alright so I

286
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:22,669
was playing League of Legends like like

287
00:10:20,229 --> 00:10:26,569
the first season started League of

288
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:28,009
Legends was it had no support right I

289
00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:28,339
came from a game called heroes of

290
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:29,749
newerth

291
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:31,069
I I switched to League of Legends

292
00:10:29,749 --> 00:10:32,419
because all my friends quit and my

293
00:10:31,069 --> 00:10:34,279
brother was like hey you got come play

294
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:36,229
with me and my friends like dota I

295
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:37,249
picked up cuz he wasn't playing it his

296
00:10:36,229 --> 00:10:38,839
friends League

297
00:10:37,249 --> 00:10:40,639
what were your professional at that time

298
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,799
or you were just an amateur I wasn't

299
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,479
anything right I think the best that

300
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,839
place was I was top 100 on the Hawn

301
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:46,399
ladder

302
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,569
he wasn't the earth ladder but some that

303
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,239
like I was not a professional player or

304
00:10:47,569 --> 00:10:51,349
anything I did well in world Warcraft

305
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:53,749
but like I didn't consider myself

306
00:10:51,349 --> 00:10:55,729
professional right and so I just jumped

307
00:10:53,749 --> 00:10:56,929
to League of Legends and the I remember

308
00:10:55,729 --> 00:10:58,759
first three games at played I had

309
00:10:56,929 --> 00:11:01,339
averaged 30 kills a game and I was like

310
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:02,989
this game is so easy like I can't new

311
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:05,419
this is a children's game this game is

312
00:11:02,989 --> 00:11:07,699
dumb I hated the game when I first

313
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:09,199
started and then like onwards and

314
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:11,299
onwards onwards and I ended up getting

315
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:14,869
into it and I went to the very top I

316
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:17,329
remember I got no this because I was

317
00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:19,909
ranked 3 in the month it took me to

318
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:23,959
level 230 rank came out and when rank

319
00:11:19,909 --> 00:11:25,999
came out I hit rank 3 third in the 30

320
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:27,859
North America Oh playing exhausting

321
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:29,899
night Catarina and everyone was just

322
00:11:27,859 --> 00:11:31,789
like who is this guy because all the top

323
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:32,569
players are from beta and so no one knew

324
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:34,399
who I was

325
00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:36,000
except for one person who would become

326
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,670
my future teammate locust

327
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,069
locus knew me because he said play World

328
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:42,899
of Warcraft on my server and he

329
00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:44,699
remembered that I was a top PvP on that

330
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:46,560
server and I made the Kinect that way

331
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:48,029
and then we started a team together so

332
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,160
it's like you know that six degrees of

333
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:52,319
separation it's like in eSports it's

334
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,389
actually like I know one person they

335
00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:57,480
know everyone else then that's how it

336
00:11:54,389 --> 00:12:02,519
was this seven years ago crazy it's not

337
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:03,720
even that long it is but if you think

338
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:05,819
about it how much things have changed

339
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,879
like you said you guys just formed a

340
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:12,379
team and then look where you are like

341
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:12,379
seven years isn't that long for how far

342
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,550
in eSports I think six months is a long

343
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:19,470
time he used to be so crazy that in the

344
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:21,000
first two seasons people people were

345
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:23,639
like what's your long-term plan now it's

346
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,529
like that's a joke right so so in in

347
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:27,420
normal businesses from what I understand

348
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:29,370
dr. pan plans like a ten year plan you

349
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,230
know short-term is one year long term is

350
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,720
ten years and then that's it

351
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:36,990
in eSports long year long term is one

352
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,269
year and short term is one week and so I

353
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:41,670
couldn't tell you at any given moment in

354
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:43,139
like like at some periods during the

355
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:45,540
last five years a lot of periods well

356
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:47,759
that was doing the week after mm-hmm and

357
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,019
I even even now like two months ago if

358
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:50,730
you had asked me are you gonna quit

359
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:53,639
legal and she's like hell no - I love

360
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:55,829
legal legends and then EFT comes out you

361
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,689
know I blow up plain TFT and now I'm

362
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:59,579
like an entire I'm like a strategy gamer

363
00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:01,050
now and it's just it's really strange

364
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:04,199
because I that's no we're way I expected

365
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:05,850
to go and like mice like my success I'm

366
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:06,269
trying really hard not to take it for

367
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,769
granted

368
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:09,329
trying to work really hard on it but

369
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:10,709
like it just came out of nowhere I like

370
00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:12,480
to think that like especially in eSports

371
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:14,759
a lot of opportunities will come up

372
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,759
randomly and it's just like your hard

373
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:21,000
work will dictate your your luck if I

374
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:22,980
need these and then then it's just up to

375
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,209
you to pursue them like then it's up to

376
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,279
your hard work to maintain like the

377
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:28,860
success you know do you think any person

378
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:30,990
just like any any single person could

379
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,759
train and play as much as you play a

380
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:34,199
certain game and become as good as you

381
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:36,420
are or do you think some people just

382
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:41,699
think differently and help as good as me

383
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:44,009
are you wear dresses I think I person

384
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:46,139
think there's a there's like this it's I

385
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:47,490
always wondered cuz I know like half

386
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:49,170
would she didn't play that game at all

387
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:51,689
and like all of a sudden

388
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:53,459
hold at the top at these well especially

389
00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:55,739
it comes to ha fou I think there's a

390
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:57,299
skill sets of people excel it so like if

391
00:13:55,739 --> 00:13:59,819
you're an FPS gamer yeah really good

392
00:13:57,299 --> 00:14:01,980
reaction time right uh uh really good

393
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:03,389
like I guess like muscle movement you

394
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,089
know when it comes to that kind of stuff

395
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:08,009
FPS skills will translate in between FPS

396
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:09,179
games right so Ashley if you want the

397
00:14:08,009 --> 00:14:10,499
best skill set you should be an FPS

398
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:11,309
gamer because there's always there's

399
00:14:10,499 --> 00:14:13,529
always a need for that skill set

400
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:15,989
strategy gamers are like you know maybe

401
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:18,929
they they don't think quickly but they

402
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:20,970
think like well like overall um they are

403
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:23,040
maybe slow mechanically they don't have

404
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:24,959
much mechanics but they're very good at

405
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,029
being able to understand and piece

406
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,859
together different pieces to make like a

407
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:30,119
whole picture right uh and so those are

408
00:14:28,859 --> 00:14:31,410
skill sets about that way a lot of

409
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,869
strategy gamers have people like this

410
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:36,029
guys toast ha food dog very very like

411
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:37,980
very good at excelling like and knowing

412
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:40,499
like the value of things and like the

413
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,699
odds of stuff happening you know and so

414
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:43,049
everyone just has different skill sets

415
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:44,040
when you grow up you learn to learn

416
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:47,069
these skill sets from a lotta different

417
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:50,249
things you know and it doesn't have to

418
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:51,689
be games like let's say you were I don't

419
00:14:50,249 --> 00:14:53,309
know like you're playing you're a

420
00:14:51,689 --> 00:14:55,049
badminton player and you have really

421
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,549
good like hand-eye coordination because

422
00:14:55,049 --> 00:14:57,660
you play a lot of tennis you play a lot

423
00:14:56,549 --> 00:14:59,669
of batmanning you need that high

424
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:01,379
hand-eye coordination to play that skill

425
00:14:59,669 --> 00:15:02,549
to play that a high level and then you

426
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:03,360
can translate some of that's going to

427
00:15:02,549 --> 00:15:05,129
play in fps

428
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,569
right and so a lot of people who are

429
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:07,769
really really talented just play games

430
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:09,089
all their lives ok well that's

431
00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:10,829
interesting to me I've always wondered

432
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:12,179
that and well I mean like if I were to

433
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:13,949
ask you like you said it's a certain

434
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:16,949
skill so do you think if you were to

435
00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:19,709
just just start playing a lot and just

436
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:22,169
trained your ass off you could become a

437
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:24,149
first person shooter player um I always

438
00:15:22,169 --> 00:15:25,980
tell people is that yes that I could

439
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:27,799
become good but do you think you become

440
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,029
like where you are I could not be

441
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:31,679
legendary at the game oh but I

442
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,879
but like because the amount of hours

443
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:34,799
that have to put in especially at this

444
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:37,679
point in my life is very it's like I

445
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,850
don't have enough timing right but if I

446
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,519
did I'd have to literally switch

447
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,600
everything into doing that so I guess at

448
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,119
some level you have to have confidence

449
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,559
in your ability to succeed right so for

450
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:48,809
me I always think if I put enough hours

451
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:49,949
into something I'll be good at it mhm

452
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:52,350
and that's just the confidence I have in

453
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:54,179
myself right but I don't ever think I

454
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:57,209
will be like a super good at something

455
00:15:54,179 --> 00:16:00,329
so like I might put in thousand hours

456
00:15:57,209 --> 00:16:02,309
playing overwatch like more than that

457
00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:02,850
let's let's say I put a whole year to

458
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:05,449
play over

459
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:08,669
in playing Call of Duty and playing apex

460
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:10,889
and csgo how good would I be at FPS

461
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:12,689
games well if I actually trained and

462
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:15,119
practiced I did a lot of like ain't

463
00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:16,919
ballestas stuff in queue has an actual

464
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:19,289
regimented schedule I'd probably make

465
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:20,729
like global we'd actually I believe that

466
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:21,839
but right now if you look at my school

467
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,879
you've laugh at me if I said that like

468
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,649
actually like if I play FPS games you

469
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:28,019
look at my skill you buckle this guy's

470
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:29,970
never played held a gun before ever I

471
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:31,649
just this guy in real life more than

472
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:33,149
like online it's really bad

473
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:35,069
like I think I'd probably be able to hit

474
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:36,869
like that you enjoy it though like if

475
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:39,179
you're not I mean my little enjoye being

476
00:16:36,869 --> 00:16:41,699
bad at something but I enjoy improving

477
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:43,139
at something so like if I if there was a

478
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:44,939
game that really like caught my

479
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:47,819
interests legalize just comes out with

480
00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:49,979
an FPS game and I'm just I just want to

481
00:16:47,819 --> 00:16:51,779
be [ __ ] good like I it kills me to be

482
00:16:49,979 --> 00:16:54,389
bad at the game I would put in the hours

483
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:56,910
oh there's not something yet I'm like I

484
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:59,220
want to do that and for me I I just see

485
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:01,470
better use of my time like for instance

486
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,059
like people a lot a lot of people see

487
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,409
you with idea I'm a normal day and I

488
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:07,709
just tell them all I do is I eat sleep

489
00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:13,889
tf2 you mm-hmm and read that sounds like

490
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:16,049
a merch idea but like for the first

491
00:17:13,889 --> 00:17:17,699
three weeks of TFT launch which it's

492
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:20,339
been about a month enough in month in

493
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:20,610
three weeks in I would plate TFT for 12

494
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,220
hours

495
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:24,299
Wow I'll wake up shower TFT for 12 hours

496
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,559
maybe go to the gym

497
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:27,240
I've personal trainer for like three

498
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:29,850
this week whatever maybe go there and

499
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,929
come back after TFT goes out for three

500
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:33,029
hours I would need a record a video

501
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:35,309
about TFT now take an hour about two

502
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:37,169
hours so like literally I like 3 a.m. or

503
00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:41,039
like 1:00 a.m. I'm recording a video in

504
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:42,419
the middle of the night to put on

505
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,889
YouTube to like fight to right answer

506
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:45,059
the occasional guys because obviously if

507
00:17:43,889 --> 00:17:47,220
I'm blowing up on TNT

508
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:50,039
I'm I capitalize on the success smart um

509
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,210
or I would walk into toast room and I

510
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,740
would talk to him about the day I'm

511
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,639
talking be like hey you know like what

512
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,710
do you think it's good what you think

513
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:57,840
it's bad I would if he's not available

514
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,190
even if I'm eating I'm bringing up TFT

515
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,110
streams I'm watching dog I'm watching

516
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,700
Hoff watching like hyped I'm watching

517
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,379
say I'm watching all these really good

518
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,360
players I would absorb information even

519
00:18:04,379 --> 00:18:08,490
if I'm not playing so like I would say

520
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,139
the first like three weeks I was putting

521
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:12,539
in like 16-hour days there sounds like

522
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:14,250
you enjoy it oh yeah I really enjoy and

523
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:15,870
right now like I would say my motivation

524
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,110
for the game is lower than when it would

525
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,400
start

526
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:19,799
for sure I'm streaming like only like

527
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,990
six hours why is that um too easy

528
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,910
no I'm actually struggling a lot right I

529
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:27,240
think I'm trying to take it easy because

530
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:30,330
um let's talk about that actually oh

531
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,070
yeah currently I'm doing a challenge I

532
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,540
started the year I wanted to do Ustream

533
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:36,090
for every single day this year and so

534
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:37,200
365 days of streaming and when I first

535
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:39,450
started challenge it's because I saw

536
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,030

542
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:54,240
thousand play anything like JRPGs

543
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:56,580
doesn't matter he has the world record

544
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:00,480
for longest time consecutively streaming

545
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:03,360
on Twitch can you guess what it is 164

546
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:07,470
days I don't know I don't know I mean if

547
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:09,510
he's 32 days it's six years what no it's

548
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:12,630
five and a half years its way every

549
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:20,640
single day it's 2,000 days so like you

550
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:22,290
that's like what uh okay he he streamed

551
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,000
through his first child and he stopped

552
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:25,620
in a second and he made a video about it

553
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,510
and that was his schedule he was

554
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,520
consistently streaming every single day

555
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:32,520
that's how he got blew up bigger that's

556
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,530
how he blew up he he was more amazing

557
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,330
though he was more consistent than early

558
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:38,220
morning talk shows he was there every

559
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:40,020
day of the week more consistent in your

560
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,549
family members he was there for you you

561
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,690
like kind of stuff and I saw that

562
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:44,520
challenge I was like I'm gonna try doing

563
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,990
that let's start easy let's start at 365

564
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,150
so I go through it

565
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,830
honestly [ __ ] joke like the first

566
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,120
hundred fifty days I was like this isn't

567
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,730
even that challenge I just do this

568
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:58,710
normally you know and then recently like

569
00:19:53,730 --> 00:20:03,000
with TFT popping off I realized that

570
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:05,280
it's really when you get new viewers you

571
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,270
have to be really careful especially it

572
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,700
comes to strategy games because there's

573
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:10,320
a lot of back seating and ones that we

574
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:14,669
actually taxi it would be like oh you

575
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:17,190
could alright yeah yeah I see that

576
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:18,419
and so yeah when it happens in TFT I

577
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,669
have a lot of new viewers coming in

578
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:22,950
they're just like super toxic super

579
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:24,840
aggressive and like I can't get like a

580
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,220
good flow going for my game for my

581
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,870
gameplay because like I'm trying to be

582
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,910
entertaining I'm trying to be uplifting

583
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:32,520
and I'll lose a game

584
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:34,320
and maybe it you know honestly like the

585
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,840
best players will play sait sometimes

586
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,270
literally the best players I watch

587
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,799
because it just happens but uh if I ever

588
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,600
do that or I have a bad day where I just

589
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,280
don't play very well like it becomes

590
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,460
super toxic to the point where like I

591
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:50,160
can't play because that on top like I

592
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,510
become like super snappy like I on

593
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,490
average ban ten people a day right now

594
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:56,039
and before when I was out when I was a

595
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:58,710
virgin like 2.5 viewers I was I never

596
00:20:56,039 --> 00:21:00,720
abandoned person I been one every two

597
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:02,880
days right it's like just the sudden the

598
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,169
influx of the popularity plus the type

599
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,850
of game I play it's really back to see

600
00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:07,559
the book because even you play to the

601
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:09,960
right odds if everything's results based

602
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:11,100
like right so like they see that like oh

603
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,539
you could've gone for that and they see

604
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,580
this oh you could have done this but

605
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:17,100
it's like even if I made the right play

606
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:19,110
I could like it could work out that for

607
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:21,120
me like oh you should have done this why

608
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:22,530
didn't you do that right and so it's

609
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,270
really straining I think the last couple

610
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:27,270
days for me doing this challenge not

611
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:28,620
having a rest day as well as doing this

612
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:30,500
I've been streaming a lot less hours

613
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,640
I've been trying to take more time off

614
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,470
still doing like what six hours a day

615
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,539
but like I went from streaming 240 hours

616
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:39,000
a month every month that's select that's

617
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:41,039
crazy like a hundred and eighty but what

618
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,929
is doing that is you feel the burn out

619
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,640
like did you feel like you had to at

620
00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:46,530
some point then I think maybe I was a

621
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,690
little more snappish at people like

622
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:49,799
because the thing about the most

623
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:51,809
important train has a stream where's

624
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:53,580
patience hmm I would say like cuz this

625
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:54,929
is seeing patients because you didn't

626
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:57,929
get a lot of dumb ask questions like

627
00:21:54,929 --> 00:21:59,909
people coming it's like like new players

628
00:21:57,929 --> 00:22:01,500
it's not a book oh you all answer to say

629
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:03,690
50 questions 50 times a day

630
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,130
so it's like you have to pay the other

631
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,570
have the patience of a saint or a

632
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:09,270
teacher to be able to do what I do

633
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:11,220
especially if you're like i market

634
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:13,140
myself or and I'm marking myself like

635
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,090
maybe Brant I don't even like saying

636
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,460
that word it feels too like artificial

637
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:19,380
like I'm I'm being like you just lots of

638
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:21,120
friendly it's just more yeah yeah I so I

639
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,590
a lot of people see me I was like it the

640
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,289
educational guy like the teacher to

641
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:26,820
professor whatever and like when they

642
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:28,260
come to my starting how do I do this how

643
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:31,230
do I do this how do I do that but like a

644
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,490
lot of times I'm just like yo like that

645
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,690
way you ask me right there like you

646
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:35,880
could Google that like that's just

647
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:38,610
really easy question it's like it's like

648
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,900
you can know but you're asking me

649
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:42,150
instead and you want me to

650
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,780
you the answer you already know it

651
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:47,400
sometimes when like that combined with

652
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:49,500
people were being dicks yeah because I

653
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,240
have a lot of new people like I think

654
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,950
before cuz I was I was averaging like

655
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,530
what 2.5 thousand three thousand viewers

656
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:58,440
which is like you know that's a success

657
00:22:55,530 --> 00:23:03,450
story anyway that's a lot but I go from

658
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:05,520
that to going to doing like thirteen

659
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:09,480
thousand nine to thirteen thousand

660
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:13,950
literally I quadrupled quintupled my

661
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:15,420
viewership the success comes with some

662
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:18,000
growing pains oh sure

663
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:19,830
and I didn't see the problems with my

664
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,680
stream challenge and like the other

665
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:25,260
stuff before but after now I'm just like

666
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:28,170
oh [ __ ] like I have to be really really

667
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:31,440
careful because like I'll get like like

668
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:32,940
really annoyed a lot quicker like all

669
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,160
this the mental fatigue tends to build

670
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:38,070
up and so for me as a defense mechanism

671
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:42,120
I'm like I try out the back d backlash

672
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:44,010
or like travel yes be upset or snap back

673
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,350
at my viewers as much I ban a lot more

674
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:49,320
people every day but that's just the

675
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:51,780
nature of the game I guess and then I I

676
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,730
take I'm streaming a little bit less you

677
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:57,150
know I I started reading fantasy fiction

678
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:58,740
to try like balance out my might be my

679
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:01,110
thing but like if you have to like if

680
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:04,080
you saw my pie chart of what I do for a

681
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:04,530
day it's still like TFT what should we

682
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,450
call it

683
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:08,580
like streaming YouTube videos like

684
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:10,230
sponsorships and then like now you just

685
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,150
add in reading right except for reading

686
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:13,830
it's like instead of it's like it used

687
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:16,080
to be I read like in about an hour to a

688
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:19,230
day on normal I just like reading mm-hmm

689
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:22,170
and now I read like four hours a day I

690
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:24,420
had a day where I slept at 4:30 cuz I I

691
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:27,960
turned out my stream I got in my bed so

692
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:29,490
I really 11:30 and it at 4:30 a.m. Wow

693
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,560
and I woke up I read some more and I'll

694
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:33,030
say huh that's nice it's really nice how

695
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,370
many hours of sleep do you generally get

696
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:37,290
oh it's generally it's like 6 to 8 hours

697
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:40,230
probably probably more along the 6 or 7

698
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:43,350
honestly I I think I used to be like I

699
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:45,600
used to be a cutie slip 14 you know 14

700
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:49,080
straight are you serious yeah I don't

701
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,510
think I tried really I mean maybe I

702
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:54,030
didn't sleep for like 24 hours I might

703
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:56,190
really I feel like as a kiss so easy

704
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:58,740
asleep a long time like you like yeah I

705
00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:03,840
thought like 10 was like a long yeah 10

706
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:06,210
to 12 is long 14 that's fine but like

707
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,530
that's a one thing I have seen about

708
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:09,060
getting older is you tend to sleep a

709
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:12,420
little bit less yeah true but that

710
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:14,250
that's like oh the worst thing is I'm

711
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:16,200
the oldest person my friend group or

712
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:17,400
likes to anyone I mean almost oh yeah

713
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,590
I'm definitely always in the house huh

714
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,780
I'm turning 30 this year okay and it

715
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:24,570
scares me on the big three the big 3-0

716
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,680
I'm just like [ __ ] guys everyone

717
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:27,630
everyone looks really young to me I'm

718
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:32,250

00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,060
age wise I think on average like

everyone's getting older in the scene

730
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,970

Twitter questions or should we welcome I

741
00:26:38,169 --> 00:26:41,710
actually had a question I'm answering

742
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:45,279
the in the gaming world and this just

743
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:47,499
recently became a thing and I'm sure you

744
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:50,710
have thoughts on this ninja joining

745
00:26:47,499 --> 00:26:53,620
mixer mixers Microsoft's new streaming

746
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:55,720
platform competing directly with twitch

747
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:59,019
for those listeners who don't know okay

748
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:00,340
so I told them in the break I was like

749
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:01,779
I've already talked a lot like II this

750
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,190
is pretty much like this car a podcast

751
00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:05,200
at this point so if you guys want

752
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:07,360
talking like please oh no this is the

753
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,470
point that's why we get to bring in

754
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,970
different people because it's a whole

755
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,210
world we don't what David and I don't

756
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:11,950
know

757
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:13,899
okay so it's actually very interesting

758
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:15,820
to us okay it's super interesting so

759
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:23,440
back to SCARA podcast let me talk to you

760
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:27,190
about my feelings about ninja is

761
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:30,070
actually like okay so ninja moved him to

762
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:31,749
mixer and obviously he's not gonna say

763
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:34,269
it's for the money but it's for the

764
00:27:31,749 --> 00:27:35,350
money of course whether he said those he

765
00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:38,619
wanted to go back to his roots

766
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:44,740
but matter what its roots work was

767
00:27:38,619 --> 00:27:46,749
twitch that's what yeah his roots was

768
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:49,799
actually halo so he's moving about for

769
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:51,940
money but also cuz like Microsoft backs

770
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:53,499
what should we call it

771
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:56,440
mixer mhm and then what ends up

772
00:27:53,499 --> 00:27:58,480
happening is I think keys would be able

773
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,519
to get like early access to Halo and

774
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,470
that's gonna be like a big pull for both

775
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:02,919
himself and tharixer for him as a

776
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,929
streamer

777
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:06,009
he was the superstar streamer and well

778
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:07,119
you have to know about twitch and I

779
00:28:06,009 --> 00:28:08,889
don't think anyone ever really talks

780
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:10,600
about this no streamer ever stays on top

781
00:28:08,889 --> 00:28:12,700
so the number one streaming on Twitch

782
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,440
never stays for more than a year every

783
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,809
single year like clockwork it moves out

784
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,279
actually the longest first place

785
00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:19,929
streaming on twitch was cutie pie I

786
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:23,619
think it at one and a half years really

787
00:28:19,929 --> 00:28:24,909
and then like after him it's like and he

788
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:26,950
was a league of Legends dreamer also

789
00:28:24,909 --> 00:28:28,749
your former team yeah yes so wait is it

790
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:29,710
happening is like he was the first and

791
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:31,570
then it went to

792
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:34,120
[Music]

793
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:37,210
I've been like dr. disrespect and then

794
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:39,790
like ninja and then shroud and then tea

795
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:41,260
foo people who's number one thief is

796
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:42,790
number one right now oh I didn't know

797
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:45,460
that I guess huge he's like he's like

798
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:46,990
ninja but like uh-huh old ninja like but

799
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,580
old ninja hit the highest highs of any

800
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:50,860
person that right hit the 900k

801
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:52,630
viewership mark collab with Drake has

802
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:54,820
his own merchant Walmart this guy's like

803
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:57,730
household name good branding end up

804
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:59,650
happening was I would say he kind of

805
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:01,270
fell off no one stays on top right yeah

806
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:02,980
kinda fell off and then you got the

807
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:07,420
superstar offer from mixer I'm assuming

808
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:09,640
and why not take it the but it's like

809
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:11,830
it's only can only be good for him in my

810
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,260
opinion like he moves off they think of

811
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:16,240
it what happens worst-case scenario he

812
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:17,640
fails to you it's like a two three-year

813
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,260
contract right I'm sure it's a two-year

814
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,970
contract he got paid a shitload of money

815
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:24,910
for it and then the marketing when he

816
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:26,710
returns can you imagine twitches the man

817
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:28,660
returns yeah and they just a silhouette

818
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:30,040
of him and a poster it [ __ ] pays on

819
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,210
Billboard's everywhere it's like so

820
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,190
you're laying on his strategy yeah

821
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:35,770
exactly like like so like worst-case

822
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:38,050
scenario he got himself a bag of like a

823
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:40,120
huge paycheck he comes back after like

824
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:42,070
troubling times and people welcomed him

825
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:44,410
back busy still them right now the most

826
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:46,840
fall person on twitch.tv Wow still and

827
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:49,810
and that's like the future right you're

828
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:53,530
predicting that and that's poorly if it

829
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:55,960
does well you know it's all good because

830
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:57,850
he's a superstar who who changed a

831
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,940
platform he's got that draw he's got

832
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:03,190
that power to be able to make like it

833
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:05,140
just elevates his brand so much to say

834
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:08,710
he can go anywhere and make people come

835
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:11,080
to you or at him right but also say this

836
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:12,880
okay so there's actually recently a

837
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,770
couple of drama between twitch in ninja

838
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,940
yeah sure time heals everything you know

839
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:18,160
so maybe that can happen in the future

840
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,660
but right now there was an issue with

841
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,570
his channel about promoting other

842
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:25,330
streamers and how there was Russian porn

843
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:27,490
oh yeah okay so so like twitch has been

844
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:31,870
really all right let me preface this by

845
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:34,530
saying imagine you're a CEO of twitch do

846
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:38,310
you care about like the they're like

847
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:41,410
random like tea sir there's a bit alive

848
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:43,990
terms of service violations or like kind

849
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:44,770
of gray area BS that's been happening

850
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:46,870
here and there

851
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:48,670
for the last year like oh this girl got

852
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:50,230
banned for doing for like doing

853
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:52,090
something dis girl thing in there for

854
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:56,830
throwing her cat you know stuff like

855
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:58,510
that and what you as a CEO care about

856
00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:00,460
like these small things these small

857
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:01,900
infractions probably not right you're

858
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,820
you're trying to figure out like okay

859
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,530
like how do i how do I work with Amazon

860
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:07,450
to create like a superior product how do

861
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,340
we make sure our ROI is good like what's

862
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:12,240
are not q3 plan like [ __ ] like that you

863
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:15,220
know it assume you have somebody else

864
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,620
yeah right and so it's probably and even

865
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:19,300
in the general sphere it's probably not

866
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,250
that important honestly it's like the

867
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:23,320
really really super hardcore Twitter

868
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:25,420
fans it's like I just [ __ ] up y'all

869
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,190
got these like POS things all this stuff

870
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:29,620
recently like they try to promote the

871
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:32,380
stupid stuff where they use ninjas

872
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:34,900
channel as like a beta test to promote

873
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:37,990
other streamers like if you're offline

874
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:39,400
the one of the biggest a what a next

875
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,530
which employee tweeted that what are the

876
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,540
biggest problems with twitch right now

877
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:46,390
is that if a streamer is online offline

878
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:49,090
and you go to a stream you will not and

879
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:51,160
you're a fan of him you may not watch

880
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:52,990
another streamer so they're trying to

881
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,300
make sure that funnel doesn't just I

882
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:56,920
some people out they want try to make it

883
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,030
easy access for you to go it instantly

884
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,130
to another streamer that they're

885
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:01,720
promoting so obviously they tried to

886
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:03,280
bait a product on ninja that was kind of

887
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,720
weird still probably what would have

888
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,790
been okay but someone was streaming porn

889
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,980
on the 49 channel on the under the four

890
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:10,390
night tag and got that got recommended

891
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,500
cuz they would recommend the all four

892
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,970
night streamers because obviously me

893
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,790
just fans or fortnight fans they would

894
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:17,020
recommend their category and so ninja

895
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:19,360
obviously doesn't like his brand

896
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:21,580
promoting porn it's kind of [ __ ] so

897
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,740
he like had a Twitter video about it hey

898
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:26,260
you know this is stupid [ __ ] oh yeah

899
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:27,850
yeah yeah and then the CEO apologized

900
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:30,160
they kind of reverted to his channel all

901
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:31,390
this stuff in the end it's like this is

902
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,730
only good thing this is only good for a

903
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:36,640
danger like that's I see like ninja

904
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:39,010
walks away clean he is on this new

905
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:42,300
platform and I think success or failure

906
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:44,980
will be based on who switches mm-hmm

907
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,150
I'm very honest I tell my chat look do

908
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,740
you that mixer comes at me with like a

909
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:50,380
10 million dollars I'm out the door you

910
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:53,940
know yeah I even like 5 million I'm out

911
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,940
the door see you guys that we did it for

912
00:32:56,299 --> 00:32:59,820
has a podcast we were just talking about

913
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:01,710
this were like yeah Skaar what about 1

914
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:03,900
million 1 million not really well what

915
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:07,820
about 2 and I'm just like whoa it's like

916
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:07,820
I don't like this job for them right

917
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:15,090
let's work our way down yeah but I think

918
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:17,400
it's really interesting and generally

919
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:20,190
almost everyone I talk to it it says

920
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:22,980
that mixer needs more people to drive

921
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:24,630
over like ideally didn't want five of

922
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,490
the top ten shops right well you can't

923
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:28,380
just have one yeah yeah well maybe you

924
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:30,659
can I'm like yeah but like it's like

925
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:32,460
it's like PewDiePie for D life right and

926
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:34,110
right yeah do you know any other

927
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,340
streamer sister you want do you live no

928
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:37,740
you know any streamers to stream my

929
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:39,059
mixer no but do you know people would be

930
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:41,370
heard of mixer yeah do you know people

931
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:43,710
who stream on Twitch yes yep bunch of

932
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:45,720
random people I'm sure so like there's

933
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:47,850
no draw there if it's just one we got

934
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,750
like five superstars you can do it

935
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:50,190
mm-hmm

936
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,659
I've seen some extra streamers the

937
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:55,440
number one streamer on mixer that wasn't

938
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:59,130
Ninja was a 24/7 uh radio station so

939
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,929
they got some ways to go before I'm

940
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:01,200
pretty sure that's illegal as well by

941
00:34:00,929 --> 00:34:03,809
the way

942
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:07,230
but like I'm like always positive that's

943
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:09,720
not allowed but uh the other fridge have

944
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:11,820
you ever met ninja or played games with

945
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,109
him no never he plays fortnight he's

946
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:16,099
he's at the first-person shooter yeah

947
00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:18,389
yes I'm not an FPS guy he's also like

948
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:19,770
remember what everyone that's on me is a

949
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,810
really cool guy really chill guy but

950
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:25,770
like my worlds don't intersect like

951
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:27,240
right I don't leave the house so so I

952
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:28,200
get difficult for me to meet people when

953
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:31,409
like I don't go anywhere

954
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:34,109
um so that's probably the hardest thing

955
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:36,810
but yeah I would consider an agent to be

956
00:34:34,109 --> 00:34:39,629
like very close like a C or B level like

957
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:41,339
a superstar like just in general oh yeah

958
00:34:39,629 --> 00:34:43,139
yeah like shays he's like amazing Bob

959
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:47,550
he's in like mainstream yeah yeah yeah

960
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:49,139
like commercial yeah I'm like I I don't

961
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:52,139
always say this phrase I'm pseudo famous

962
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:53,730
so you may know of me if you're like my

963
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:57,570
specific demographic you're like yeah

964
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:59,550
you're 18 to 28 living in Southern

965
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:02,160
California who's also predominantly

966
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:05,070
Asian and you really like bubble tea and

967
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:08,880
you hang on a k-town it's like

968
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:10,710
like then I'm famous no like nothing

969
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:15,840
you're giving yourself man I think

970
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:18,030
anyone who plays or yeah we go get food

971
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:24,900
you get stopped hey those people I told

972
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:26,340
you are you really what I mean like okay

973
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,380
so I think what you're saying is true

974
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:29,520
and you mate you make a good case you

975
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:31,410
should take that clip and send it to

976
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,840
mixer I think what if you were to just

977
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:36,540
like get a few of other big streamers

978
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,710
for other ones put it put together a

979
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:41,600
pitch and send it to them if they hey

980
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:44,640
give us fifty million dollars BAM okay

981
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:46,800
it'll be more I mean so like already all

982
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,180
that stuff my agency's I'm sure talking

983
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,250
to other are like it's already happening

984
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,900
like yeah I already know how could your

985
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:53,340
self we know one of the platforms are

986
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,470
talking to you right it's right it's not

987
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:57,360
mixing oh it's not mixing yeah yeah so

988
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:58,830
it's someone else but like for me it's

989
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,440
like I wouldn't do that work myself I

990
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:03,600
like this I like to think they're like

991
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:05,430
that's why I have agents debris media

992
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,870
doesn't mean to say yes or no yeah and I

993
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,310
wanna focus on just the stuff I'm good

994
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:10,200
at you know I like playing League of

995
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:11,550
Legends like playing PFT I want to

996
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,010
create content I don't want to get

997
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:15,180
bogged down by political like politics

998
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:19,110
stuff or I don't wanna get bogged down

999
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:20,670
by like things I don't like like mm-hmm

1000
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:22,290
a lot of times people when you talk to

1001
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,460
corporate people it's like so how did

1002
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:25,200
you feel about your brand like what do

1003
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:27,870
you think your brand outreach your

1004
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,790
growth and like they start using these

1005
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:31,170
buzzwords I'm just like I know what you

1006
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:33,780
mean I can understand the English

1007
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:36,270
language but the more you talk like this

1008
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:38,220
the more I don't want to listen right so

1009
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:40,140
like I tried I think a lot of our

1010
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:42,060
success as a household and a lot of

1011
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:44,100
streamer success is the ability to stay

1012
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:45,390
authentic to their mm-hmm - they're like

1013
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:56,220
brand I'm going to use one of those

1014
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:57,660
terms I'm sorry okay sure but like a lot

1015
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,040
of their success and I think a success

1016
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,390
of a lot of content creators has been

1017
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,890
awesome to City and being able to

1018
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:03,990
capture that has been really difficult

1019
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:05,400
for a lot of people you know I'm sure

1020
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:08,220
you've run into problems where it's like

1021
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,030
is this you know Ryan material is this

1022
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,680
something I'm proud of

1023
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:12,630
sure and maybe you've released things

1024
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,500
that have been successful that you don't

1025
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:15,500
like all the time

1026
00:37:16,229 --> 00:37:20,920
it's I mean it does take it's it's a

1027
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:22,989
matter of like your own self right leg

1028
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,729
yes you think people like you said you

1029
00:37:22,989 --> 00:37:27,189
could do really well but if you're not

1030
00:37:24,729 --> 00:37:28,299
happy with it then yeah okay well I mean

1031
00:37:27,189 --> 00:37:30,910
a lot of people don't think that way

1032
00:37:28,299 --> 00:37:32,499
though you know but maybe it's different

1033
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:34,449
for streaming I mean works on YouTube to

1034
00:37:32,499 --> 00:37:35,619
not be authentic and still be able to

1035
00:37:34,449 --> 00:37:37,749
get away with it but maybe it's

1036
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:39,849
streaming you have to be streaming cuz

1037
00:37:37,749 --> 00:37:41,979
they see you so closely and like right

1038
00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:44,709
if you're a good actor you're in

1039
00:37:41,979 --> 00:37:47,189
Hollywood you're not streaming be like

1040
00:37:44,709 --> 00:37:50,380
for them to see six hours of your life

1041
00:37:47,189 --> 00:37:53,019
you can't act you can't act and fake it

1042
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:55,809
that long yeah exactly like you will

1043
00:37:53,019 --> 00:37:57,699
slip up you know right well YouTube yeah

1044
00:37:55,809 --> 00:38:01,239
cut out all the parts like I could be

1045
00:37:57,699 --> 00:38:03,819
like a completely like PG person if you

1046
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:07,390
just ignore ignore me cussing like every

1047
00:38:03,819 --> 00:38:08,920
you know five or ten minutes right so

1048
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:10,569
yeah I agree like anything you chopped

1049
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,130
up and at it you can make me look like I

1050
00:38:10,569 --> 00:38:14,400
say you can make me look like the devil

1051
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:17,439
it doesn't really matter but on you

1052
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,029
streaming yep nope no possible so you

1053
00:38:17,439 --> 00:38:20,799
said you a lot of people see you as like

1054
00:38:19,029 --> 00:38:22,029
a teacher do you think your appeal to

1055
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,679
and why you're so popular is because

1056
00:38:22,029 --> 00:38:25,959
you're good at the game or because they

1057
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:29,650
just genuinely like you okay Oh

1058
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:31,839
aside from very very very rare cases I

1059
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:33,009
think if you're trying to make a name

1060
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:35,439
for yourself you have to be good at the

1061
00:38:33,009 --> 00:38:37,239
game okay like you being good at the

1062
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:39,759
game is a draw for people to come and

1063
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:41,829
watch you there are exceptions you you

1064
00:38:39,759 --> 00:38:44,859
should be entertaining you should be

1065
00:38:41,829 --> 00:38:46,749
consistent you like all this stuff

1066
00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:49,420
you should have presence you should be

1067
00:38:46,749 --> 00:38:52,539
able to like I don't know like all this

1068
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:55,119
stuff but I think if you're not good at

1069
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:57,130
video games why would people watch what

1070
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,749
what what I mean is you're like there's

1071
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:00,339
there's being good at games and there's

1072
00:38:58,749 --> 00:39:02,979
being like you like in the top

1073
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:05,439
percentile no I think you need to be the

1074
00:39:02,979 --> 00:39:07,029
top percent oh okay well there any other

1075
00:39:05,439 --> 00:39:08,979
cases where like they're just maybe

1076
00:39:07,029 --> 00:39:12,219
really good-looking or they're just a

1077
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:15,880
nice personality or like the show maybe

1078
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:18,849
you can have success that's not at the

1079
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:21,519
top level if that's the case if you want

1080
00:39:18,849 --> 00:39:23,829
to be like a 10,000 plus streamer and

1081
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:25,599
you cannot suck ass at your video game

1082
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:27,400
they are known to play especially if

1083
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,420
you're not variety streamer 10,000 plus

1084
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,470
dollars

1085
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:32,940
which I think there's only handful I

1086
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:35,070
think people will average 10,000 is less

1087
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:36,540
than 50 or like less than 60 if you want

1088
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:38,430
to be and a lot of those channels are

1089
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,080
like like tournament channels you know

1090
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:41,790
so individual wise it might be less than

1091
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:44,040
like 40 right but if you're one of those

1092
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:46,140
people and you're and you're no for

1093
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:48,030
streaming one game or one type of game

1094
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,410
so you're not a variety streamer cuz

1095
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:51,690
people who watch variety streamers like

1096
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:53,310
lyric are there for different reasons

1097
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:54,360
like they like his personality I don't

1098
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:55,980
know how good of a gamer is how

1099
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:58,170
completely awesome I'm not watching

1100
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:00,240
streaming up to tell uh he oh I could

1101
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:02,370
say very confidently is not superstar

1102
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,750
level like that's super good like a lot

1103
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:05,340
of the other streamers read no for one

1104
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:08,670
game like League of Legends or one game

1105
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:10,920
like apex legends or like for a night

1106
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:13,680
they have to be good that he had you're

1107
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,750
it's even ninja you know who was at the

1108
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,760
very top of his game he won the first

1109
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:20,430
pro-am like he the all the tournaments

1110
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:23,040
he was the winner so people could he

1111
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:26,250
wasn't the best player I can confidently

1112
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,840
say he has no way in hell but he he won

1113
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:30,030
all the tournaments he was good enough

1114
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,830
to where he could say he was elite

1115
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:33,510
status and a part of what made his

1116
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:34,590
appeal drop ended last year he didn't

1117
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:36,870
qualify for a world championship this

1118
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:39,540
year I heard is really bad right and

1119
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:41,130
like as of you are like you don't want

1120
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,510
to watch someone who does who's not good

1121
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:43,680
enough to qualify you know there's so

1122
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:46,830
many other people I can watch why would

1123
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:48,090
I bother about with a bother so for yeah

1124
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:50,730
I think there's an argument to be said

1125
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:51,990
with that though like with a basketball

1126
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:53,970
like LeBron he didn't make the playoffs

1127
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:55,380
when people start watching him just how

1128
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:57,690
much do you bring to the table when it

1129
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:59,250
comes to video games like if you're not

1130
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:01,080
playing you want to watch someone who's

1131
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:02,760
good you know he's either good or

1132
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:05,190
entertaining and it's very rare to find

1133
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:07,140
the full package the full package player

1134
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:10,380
who's like good entertaining streams a

1135
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:13,620
long time yeah yeah all this stuff so uh

1136
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:15,150
I think if you're especially a exclusive

1137
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:17,160
streamer streamer that streams one game

1138
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:20,280
you have to be good to break the DIF I

1139
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:22,800
figure mark if you're not who you can't

1140
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,380
compete I'm a hundred percent serious

1141
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,420
you have to be not just good elite if I

1142
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:30,360
wasn't challenger or a grandmaster like

1143
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:32,910
I was at the very top I would I would

1144
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:35,010
lose several thousand of my viewers

1145
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:36,630
guaranteed actually my viewership has

1146
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:39,780
gone down because I'm not even higher

1147
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:41,730
rasili yes oh wow it's that like oh

1148
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,329
relation is interesting I didn't know

1149
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:43,709
that

1150
00:41:42,329 --> 00:41:45,269
I thought they were just there I mean

1151
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,559
like I know like you said if you're good

1152
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:48,269
at the game you bring in viewers but I

1153
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:51,059
thought after they get to know you you

1154
00:41:48,269 --> 00:41:52,679
know um a lot of people um hardcore fans

1155
00:41:51,059 --> 00:41:54,539
a lot of people like the game so they'll

1156
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:56,869
just watch the very top person on the

1157
00:41:54,539 --> 00:41:59,189
section which is white which is uh

1158
00:41:56,869 --> 00:42:00,809
discovery system is awful so like

1159
00:41:59,189 --> 00:42:03,420
YouTube has the algorithm which everyone

1160
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:05,729
hates and despises but it's phenomenally

1161
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,739
well well done like it is the most

1162
00:42:05,729 --> 00:42:09,660
successful algorithm to finding stuff

1163
00:42:07,739 --> 00:42:11,849
that you will watch right in like of

1164
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:14,009
anything I know mm-hmm even if it's

1165
00:42:11,849 --> 00:42:16,499
complete [ __ ] I hate it hahaha but

1166
00:42:14,009 --> 00:42:19,170
uh twitches is terrible which is what

1167
00:42:16,499 --> 00:42:21,029
just a numbers based on numbers you get

1168
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:22,619
so like if you're not in the first page

1169
00:42:21,029 --> 00:42:24,420
you're not gonna get discovered

1170
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:26,849
who's gonna discover you like why would

1171
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:28,380
I watch people always ask me how do you

1172
00:42:26,849 --> 00:42:30,569
be a good streamer and I'm just like

1173
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:32,579
have a reason for me with a watch like

1174
00:42:30,569 --> 00:42:34,259
what's your niche you know most people

1175
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:36,059
anisha's they have to start out being

1176
00:42:34,259 --> 00:42:37,979
good and then they can work from there

1177
00:42:36,059 --> 00:42:40,799
like if you could say you're the best X

1178
00:42:37,979 --> 00:42:43,109
in the world people will watch mm-hmm

1179
00:42:40,799 --> 00:42:44,729
but that's it like unless you have that

1180
00:42:43,109 --> 00:42:46,859
kind of draw no one will ever discover

1181
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:48,719
you it's kind of like a resume in a way

1182
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:50,009
then yeah yeah to some extent you could

1183
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:51,359
be like hey I graduated first to

1184
00:42:50,009 --> 00:42:52,949
Stanford but like instead first to

1185
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:55,469
Stanford like I'm the number one like

1186
00:42:52,949 --> 00:42:58,769
challenger player in Brazil or something

1187
00:42:55,469 --> 00:43:00,179
like that you know mm-hmm Wow well

1188
00:42:58,769 --> 00:43:03,890
that's good to know for all the kids who

1189
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:03,890
want to become streamers oh you're not

1190
00:43:04,219 --> 00:43:08,549
you got to be the best in the world it's

1191
00:43:06,749 --> 00:43:11,309
like start practicing that's some real

1192
00:43:08,549 --> 00:43:13,109
advice though I think but I I appreciate

1193
00:43:11,309 --> 00:43:15,420
it some people are just like I can do it

1194
00:43:13,109 --> 00:43:17,609
you want to know what's [ __ ] crazy

1195
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:19,859
the difference between you play see well

1196
00:43:17,609 --> 00:43:23,069
I like the first tournament or not it's

1197
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:25,019
a difference becoming up or down mm if I

1198
00:43:23,069 --> 00:43:26,549
lost three games in a row on stream in

1199
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:29,130
the first four three weeks i streamed

1200
00:43:26,549 --> 00:43:30,689
PFT I will lose 2,000 viewers three

1201
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:32,880
games already have it done to us like a

1202
00:43:30,689 --> 00:43:35,429
math it's no it's like I watch other

1203
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,660
streamers and most players most people

1204
00:43:35,429 --> 00:43:39,839
come in will watch to the end of your

1205
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:41,789
game and leave anyways but people will

1206
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:44,369
not watch a loser does it worry you then

1207
00:43:41,789 --> 00:43:46,259
that I mean so no I mean because your

1208
00:43:44,369 --> 00:43:47,160
current viewers [ __ ] and while you're

1209
00:43:46,259 --> 00:43:49,650
doing so well right now is because

1210
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:51,630
you're doing so well at the TFT does

1211
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:54,119
ever worry you that like all of a sudden

1212
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:56,010
new game comes out and no one cares

1213
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:57,630
about TFT OH

1214
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:58,650
which I mean like the or you don't have

1215
00:43:57,630 --> 00:44:01,170
to switch but if people aren't

1216
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:03,120
interested in it oh absolutely but like

1217
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:04,680
I think at that level like you don't

1218
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:07,200
want to worry about too much like for me

1219
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,700
it's like focus on yourself and focus on

1220
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,280
the grind and try to make the best

1221
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:13,650
product like I'm confident enough with

1222
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:15,510
for me as a person that I will excel

1223
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:16,800
regardless what happens like if you're

1224
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:18,210
gonna ask are are you gonna be

1225
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,860
successful ten years from now hell yeah

1226
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:21,000
20 years from hell yeah

1227
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:25,710
thirty years from now I'm probably dead

1228
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:27,030
but if I'm not probably still in success

1229
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:29,120
can mean a lot of different things but

1230
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:32,550
like mm-hmm I think personally I always

1231
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:35,070
I'm confident of my ability um and my

1232
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:37,500
skill set to find success regarding in

1233
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:40,230
any yeah okay well that's a good answer

1234
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:41,670
then well this this is basically just

1235
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:47,070
like how to become a very successful

1236
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:49,860

1242
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:13,980
Cesar asks how often do you wear suits

00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:15,750
never pretty much never steal on the at

1244
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:17,490
the LCS analyst desk I've been on the

00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:29,580
that so that's a guy inside I think it's

1251
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:31,770
just like they saw me recently a suit

1252
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:35,720
like a now it's okay I spend most of my

1253
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:39,510
paycheck for the LCS desk on that I

1254
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:41,070
don't see myself I want to treat myself

1255
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:42,360
like I don't spend money on anything I

1256
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:47,310
really only spend it on food which I

1257
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:53,430
love and that's it skaara actually

1258
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:55,860
bought me my first suit oh yeah we went

1259
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:57,390
to some random bootleg place and like

1260
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:59,340
they were slightly giving deals for sure

1261
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:00,900
for suits I'm like baka you go one let's

1262
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:03,890
so I can get yeah well you didn't need

1263
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,890
what I just looked about yeah

1264
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:19,470
I see really nice person but yeah it's

1265
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,030
like that's all that's all I have have

1266
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:22,650
feels like I just got to see recently

1267
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:24,390
and then they're interested so I've

1268
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:25,829
spent money on that and then recently I

1269
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:29,069
got a mechanical keyboard custom-made

1270
00:46:25,829 --> 00:46:31,859
for myself it's super nice I can't rave

1271
00:46:29,069 --> 00:46:34,710
enough about this like I want everything

1272
00:46:31,859 --> 00:46:36,510
I own to be custom like ideally cuz iPad

1273
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:38,160
okay I don't know if it's like we use

1274
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:39,869
mentality by like saying they're like I

1275
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,760
got this and I'm the only one who owns

1276
00:46:39,869 --> 00:46:42,900
it no that's I mean it's cool I feel

1277
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,790
like everything right now I was like oh

1278
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,380
you get a participation award and I'm

1279
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:48,540
just like I don't want a participation

1280
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:50,460
award I want the only one give it to me

1281
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:54,780
like and so like you're at that level

1282
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:57,599
where you can get I commissioned a

1283
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:59,940
friend Nathan to build one for me and I

1284
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,470
got like I think I got I delved into a

1285
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:04,050
world of mechanical keyboards by the way

1286
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:06,450
stupidly expensive like pretty much all

1287
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:07,770
the stuff you want is like sold out yet

1288
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:11,099
to buy them I like their secondhand

1289
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:13,710
party websites or through people they

1290
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:16,049
they move up like two times in price and

1291
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:17,309
it costs like one to two grand to get

1292
00:47:16,049 --> 00:47:18,930
your final board if you want it done

1293
00:47:17,309 --> 00:47:22,440
well so I have like a one to two grand

1294
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:24,390
board it's super nice and I'm gladly

1295
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:27,059
easy for like the next decade and I only

1296
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:28,140
the only two things I spent money on for

1297
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:28,500
like the entire year I'm not even

1298
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:31,470
kidding

1299
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:34,290
question number two from Twitter from

1300
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:35,640
Griffin Hatake does living in a house

1301
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:37,680
with other streamers caused unnecessary

1302
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:39,540
tension and frustration and how do you

1303
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:42,900
deal with feeling irritated with each

1304
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:45,270
other the mess mess is you make messes

1305
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:48,930
you make and deciding which is very

1306
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:51,510
specific who has more break this down a

1307
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:53,010
bit I mean living with other even like

1308
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:54,510
creator streamers whatever you want to

1309
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:56,309
call it I'm sure there are frustrations

1310
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:58,380
right oh yeah absolutely even living

1311
00:47:56,309 --> 00:48:00,660
with living a roommate right but but

1312
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:02,880
more specifically its you guys all share

1313
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:04,170
something together is it do you find

1314
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,180
that more I guess they're saying

1315
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:08,880
frustrating but do you find helps okay

1316
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:10,440
all remember I talked a lot about my

1317
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,790
problems with recently about like I've

1318
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,859
streaming every day yeah and all that

1319
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:16,020
stuff and part of the reason why I feel

1320
00:48:13,859 --> 00:48:17,700
like I am not doing as well as the first

1321
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:19,000
couple weeks this is toast recently left

1322
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:22,330
the Canada

1323
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:25,780
his family again and I think him leaving

1324
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:28,120
motivated like he motivated me to to be

1325
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:30,520
better at TFT because me and him nice

1326
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:31,840
like bounce off energy like it was kind

1327
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,910
of like a friendly competition yes

1328
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:35,320
because like he's a top one streamer I'm

1329
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:37,450
like number four and I was always

1330
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:39,040
looking up to him and like I bet I'm

1331
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:40,480
gonna beat him I wasn't like do this

1332
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,280
better I'm gonna do this better and like

1333
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,530
I'm sure he sees that like because I'm

1334
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:45,940
hustling he has to hustle as well but

1335
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:47,710
like ever since he left like I've had

1336
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:49,510
like more like problems in terms of like

1337
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:51,760
my focus and my motivation and like all

1338
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:52,960
this [ __ ] comes up it's like I know it's

1339
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,120
still a lot more when he just left

1340
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,160
recently and it feels like like you know

1341
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,840
he helped me out a lot but not just him

1342
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:01,150
like it's very motivating to live with

1343
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,100
people who are successful equally minded

1344
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:07,390
I am true the frustrations come in like

1345
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:09,480
terms of like I guess privacy like

1346
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:11,770
personal space is not that good I think

1347
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,990
you want more and more of your own

1348
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:16,240
personal life as you go grow older like

1349
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:18,010
right it's really I I see very few

1350
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,680
people who do where that's not the case

1351
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:23,110
usually you enjoy company of others like

1352
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:25,240
and you're like early 20s and select

1353
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:26,650
your late 20s but like once you get your

1354
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,150
late 20s honestly you looking for a

1355
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:30,360
relationship you're looking for like -

1356
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:32,380
like really settle down and I think that

1357
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,640
we talk about this a lot we tried to

1358
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:35,530
make off on a business and I think

1359
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:37,660
they're like for the most part like in

1360
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:39,220
the end we weren't sure we what we had

1361
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:40,960
big dreams like we went off fine to be

1362
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:42,520
like a maybe a household name all this

1363
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,290
stuff but then we realized that like

1364
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,480
while we're trying to go for so business

1365
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:49,000
oriented stuff between friends not sure

1366
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,740
how long is this gonna like even stay

1367
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,290
together or us to stay together as a

1368
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:55,840
group currently like we may there's a

1369
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:57,520
chance that we plan to like just disband

1370
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:00,850
at the end at the end of like the

1371
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:02,800
current lease because just because like

1372
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:06,850
not because we hate each other but

1373
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:09,760
because it's it's like that time a

1374
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:12,760
little house said it's hard to push

1375
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:14,800
through the plateau in a way i pushing

1376
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:17,080
through a plateau it's like I feel like

1377
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,970
there's a time when people know that you

1378
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:20,200
should move on or that you you want to

1379
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:22,150
move on and while we're having a great

1380
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,410
time together and we're being very

1381
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:24,490
successful like I think bring us

1382
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:26,080
together has made everyone more

1383
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:28,390
successful right and we we're like

1384
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:30,040
creating lifelong friendships and one of

1385
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:32,410
the one of the words or

1386
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:34,150
instead Lily used to say was that you

1387
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:39,220
know what they said that it was the best

1388
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:41,020
of times in in our last house she it was

1389
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:42,760
during one of our like we were sitting

1390
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:44,710
down like eating like talking she's like

1391
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:48,790
you know you don't know the best of

1392
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:50,800
times until they're gone and she said

1393
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:52,000
that that could be us right now and I

1394
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,740
thought I always think about that

1395
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,620
because I'm just like that deep line

1396
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:58,180
yeah I don't know like I really may

1397
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:00,160
think I may look back on this and think

1398
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:01,270
this is probably the or maybe could be

1399
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,730
one of the best times of my life

1400
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:05,170
mm-hmm I truly believe that that could

1401
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:06,760
be the case and so I'm trying to just

1402
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:08,500
not take you for granted I get again

1403
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:10,390
right and do the best I can and not

1404
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:12,730
really worry about where stuff ends you

1405
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:14,890
know cuz it's gonna end at some point

1406
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:17,020
I'll find it's gonna dissolve because we

1407
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:18,760
decided not to like kind of taking new

1408
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:20,200
members and not to like kind of expand

1409
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,910
at least currently maybe that changes

1410
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,410
the next couple of months who knows but

1411
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:25,780
like we try they make it very very

1412
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:28,030
exclusive and by doing so it's like well

1413
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:29,380
if one person leaves like it's like you

1414
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:31,870
know it's like a boy band you know you

1415
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:33,520
just can't kick you out [ __ ] Justin

1416
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:35,440
Timberlake and expect you know the rest

1417
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,720
of the band to stay together mm-hmm

1418
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,460
oh we're like a really shitty boyband

1419
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:45,370
like you could bring in we're like we're

1420
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:46,720
like S Club 7 do you remember that real

1421
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:52,840
throwback like no one even remembers

1422
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:54,940
them in life yeah but yeah like we're

1423
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:57,160
like like that you guys are like you

1424
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:58,660
guys are a family yeah yeah I actually

1425
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:02,110
think of him as my family I'm not I'm

1426
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:05,410
not super close to my uh my real family

1427
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:07,330
anymore um I had to visit them next year

1428
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:10,270
by the way I promise my fault my father

1429
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:13,090
my grandparents my grandfather's last

1430
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:16,390
wish before he dies he's 92 right now

1431
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:18,460
it's the seam his his grandsons and so I

1432
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:21,100
have I was like I will definitely go

1433
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:23,200
just tell me what so I'm planning a trip

1434
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:25,540
next year to see him before he dies

1435
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,820
where did your family live my family's

1436
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:35,590
all in China okay

1437
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:37,990
also that is that's pretty tough all my

1438
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:39,940
fit like my mom dad moved to China

1439
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:41,740
my brother's studying in med school or

1440
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:43,840
trying to go into med school over

1441
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:45,430
Boston but he just came back from China

1442
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,760
too so like I was the only person in the

1443
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:48,430
country

1444
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,660
for a long time actually talk about my

1445
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:51,510
family do you know how my family a

1446
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:54,280
little bit we thought about it that's

1447
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:57,640
okay it's subject ever you're

1448
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:59,740
comfortable okay I've talked about this

1449
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:01,930
like I guess maybe three friends I'm

1450
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:04,690
knob is that super public because I feel

1451
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:10,450
like it's just a little bit awkward

1452
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:14,410
talked about okay um so my family does

1453
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:16,150
pretty well in China I would say uh my

1454
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:19,540
aunt owns the four largest hospitals in

1455
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:23,380
Sean high also very well uh yes so

1456
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:25,240
fairly well uh like I learned a lot of

1457
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:28,780
interesting things my grandfather or one

1458
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:31,150
of my grandfather's yeah one of my

1459
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:33,130
grandfather's did train ten thousand

1460
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:35,260
people for the Beijing opening Olympics

1461
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:36,430
Wow he was one of the eight generals in

1462
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:37,750
the Chinese art I think it's called

1463
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:38,860
general is where like there's eight

1464
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:41,290
different people who controls at least

1465
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:42,880
like ten thousand people I have no idea

1466
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:44,350
it's really weird but like he retired

1467
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,640
recently but he was the one who trained

1468
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:47,320
the opening ceremony he's trained for

1469
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:51,190
six months they cut down from ten

1470
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:52,960
thousands like eight or seven and so

1471
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:54,369
like yeah you saw the Beijing Olympic

1472
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,960
ceremony when they ran across the screen

1473
00:53:54,369 --> 00:53:58,990
all that said my grandfather my

1474
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:02,200
grandparents trained that my my dad's

1475
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:03,460
younger brother is like one of the

1476
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,410
number one contact lawyers in the

1477
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:08,170
country or like and he graduated like

1478
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:11,470
first in his class from MIT something

1479
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:13,210
like that my my dad's like one of the

1480
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:14,770
best offshore engineering platforms in

1481
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:16,119
the country he got hired by Chinese

1482
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:19,000
government and he wanted a number one

1483
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:20,109
civilian award last year Wow which is

1484
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,520
great for me because they could just get

1485
00:54:20,109 --> 00:54:24,040
they could just give me visas for free

1486
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:25,869
it's actually excellent bunch of so like

1487
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:27,369
actually like like my father's

1488
00:54:25,869 --> 00:54:28,960
generation I could I consider me like

1489
00:54:27,369 --> 00:54:32,080
like the generation of miracles you know

1490
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:33,550
like kind of like you know talking about

1491
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,570
you know they're like the generation of

1492
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:35,560
miracles and like they see our

1493
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:37,450
generation is like the failure

1494
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,740
generation like they always what did

1495
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:39,280
what do they think about your career

1496
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:41,590
choice

1497
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,850
oh they actually like I think most of

1498
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:44,770
them like me cuz I'm like the most

1499
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:46,270
successful although like everyone else

1500
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:48,160
is like it's like you don't know where

1501
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:49,810
do they get it though oh yeah yeah cuz

1502
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:52,620
like it's like it's huge engine it's

1503
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:54,480
legal X's and all the fan

1504
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:55,980
Chai's places all this stuff they don't

1505
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:59,820
sign with like Nike and [ __ ] like that

1506
00:54:55,980 --> 00:55:03,030
and any wild [ __ ] China but so like in

1507
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:05,850
China in some countries you can have

1508
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:08,190
money without power okay it's possible

1509
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:10,380
or vice-versa in China it's not possible

1510
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:14,520
if you have power you also have money

1511
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:19,110
like it's and so like I would say my my

1512
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:22,050
family is relatively powerful in in that

1513
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:24,990
country uh-huh and I I'll talk about

1514
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:26,850
that much because like I don't like to

1515
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:28,470
ever have any kind of association with

1516
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:30,660
them I don't want to feel like I can

1517
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:33,030
always fall back on going to China sure

1518
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:35,610
thing and to be honest I'm really like

1519
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:37,170
cut off from my family like I I've very

1520
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:38,790
rarely talked to them I'm like it's like

1521
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:40,380
terrible when I feel people here people

1522
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:42,390
have like oh yeah me and my mom like

1523
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:45,210
call each other on a monthly basis I'm

1524
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:47,550
like yeah me and my mom if she's like I

1525
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:49,650
remember and like I don't miss her phone

1526
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:51,270
call like maybe we'll talk like once

1527
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:53,220
every six months my brother might talk

1528
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:55,140
like once every like three months so

1529
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:57,210
it's like I'm a really like very distant

1530
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:58,830
relationship with my family I feel much

1531
00:55:57,210 --> 00:56:01,170
closer with my family in LA like my

1532
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:01,860
roommates no they're pretty much my

1533
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:03,810
second family

1534
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:05,370
didn't I deal with my mic mic closely

1535
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:07,230
related like blood ties but it's not

1536
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:10,980
it's not because there's like animosity

1537
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:12,930
no I'm just a terrible person like I

1538
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:15,360
feel like I do really really badly like

1539
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:16,740
you know I'm like the worst kind of

1540
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:19,110
friend you can have because I will never

1541
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:21,000
reach out and ask to do something and so

1542
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:22,590
like if you don't interact with me on a

1543
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,520
daily basis which I don't leave the

1544
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:25,110
house mm-hmm

1545
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:30,210
so you can't interact with me unless you

1546
00:56:25,110 --> 00:56:33,150
live with me I will like like I won't

1547
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:36,180
reef refresh the friendship kind of that

1548
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:37,710
deal because relationships and

1549
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:39,600
friendships are like the same thing you

1550
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:41,790
work at them for them to be better you

1551
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:43,500
know if you don't work at them you're

1552
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:45,210
not gonna develop good friendships and

1553
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,740
like a lot of times like I'm a very bad

1554
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:48,750
person at that and like that

1555
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:50,370
that's true for like both like my

1556
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:52,890
friendship relationships as well as like

1557
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:54,720
my household like my my actual family

1558
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:56,670
relationships now I try to get better at

1559
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:58,530
it but like that's just let's say it's

1560
00:56:56,670 --> 00:57:01,200
one of my biggest weaknesses but you're

1561
00:56:58,530 --> 00:57:02,970
working on it yeah I mean when you like

1562
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:05,250
you said you wanted more you've been

1563
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:06,240
living with your family yeah you've been

1564
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:08,820
living with these other

1565
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:10,440
streamers but you do say you want your

1566
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:11,520
own personal space and it's getting to a

1567
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,750
time where you feel like you're at that

1568
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:15,540
age where you want to have your own

1569
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:17,100
space uh yeah I know like I think

1570
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:20,520
especially when I live with offline

1571
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:22,710
people I I feel like it's it's weird for

1572
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:24,690
me to try to pursue a relationship

1573
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:26,280
because I always it's actually really

1574
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:28,619
funny because I think of them as like a

1575
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:30,180
second family I always compare like if

1576
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:32,520
I'm interested in girl I'm like what

1577
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:35,160
would my my roommates think if I brought

1578
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:37,650
her back and there I feel like they

1579
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:39,869
wouldn't be like satisfied instantly not

1580
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:42,600
interested like my traction level to

1581
00:57:39,869 --> 00:57:45,720
them doesn't matter as much as like how

1582
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:47,369
but I think my roommates will judge me

1583
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:49,410
for the person that hears well they

1584
00:57:47,369 --> 00:57:51,060
approve that closer yeah at least

1585
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:52,320
sometimes I feel that way I talk to

1586
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:54,240
other people our house well they feel

1587
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:57,630
that way too like like they have to be

1588
00:57:54,240 --> 00:58:03,480
you like if I that's tough for the

1589
00:57:57,630 --> 00:58:05,940
person like I've been in like one

1590
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,140
serious relationship and then like a

1591
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:09,180
couple of things when I like talk to

1592
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:10,710
people like I'm always just like would I

1593
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:12,210
be comfortable bringing the back and the

1594
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:14,280
answer is no which has been though a lot

1595
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:15,660
of times like I don't bother I'm very

1596
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:17,010
private about my relationships people in

1597
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:21,650
my household don't know if anyone I'm

1598
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:21,650
talking to anyone there's multiples

1599
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:26,760
before we wrap it up yeah the first

1600
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:27,990
thing that popped up when you brought up

1601
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,960
that question of like how do you guys

1602
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:32,250
diffuse issues is something is something

1603
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,770
I always think about cuz you told it to

1604
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:37,050
me and it was like I was having issues

1605
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:38,700
at one point and you're like is there

1606
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:41,070
anything you can do about it right now

1607
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:42,420
and right away and I was like no and

1608
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:44,160
you're like then why are you so focused

1609
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:45,960
on it focus things that are immediate

1610
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:48,840
and the things that you can toast with

1611
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:50,220
oh dude okay so I we talked about Mikey

1612
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:51,720
pie big a streamer legal legends

1613
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:53,640
teammate one of the biggest things I

1614
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:55,140
learned from him is to not give a [ __ ]

1615
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,670
about stuff and I feel like he learned

1616
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:58,410
that you grow older anyways like

1617
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:59,580
predominately with him he only cares

1618
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:01,580
about a couple things in life it's like

1619
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:03,990
his friends his cats

1620
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:05,369
Leisha and League of Legends that's it

1621
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:07,470
lishus his wife

1622
00:59:05,369 --> 00:59:09,270
why it's not like they're married and

1623
00:59:07,470 --> 00:59:10,200
it's like he's live in the life like

1624
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:12,390
he's got the girl

1625
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:15,119
he's got the game he's got the cat you

1626
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:16,859
know he's got he's got everything he

1627
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,780
cares about that's all he cares about

1628
00:59:16,859 --> 00:59:21,420
he doesn't care about like he's like

1629
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:23,820
image he like he wears these like white

1630
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:25,290
shirts [ __ ] he actually moved up a brand

1631
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:28,920
his mom bought him new white shirt so

1632
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:30,840
like $20 but like like he's like he's

1633
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:32,940
like flexing with his $20 Whitey's now

1634
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:34,020
but for the most part for the most part

1635
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:36,450
like he doesn't give a [ __ ] about

1636
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:38,640
anything like he'll he'll blow money

1637
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:41,220
away like he's had yes'm Gucci [ __ ]

1638
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:42,780
sneakers he has got some nice [ __ ] but

1639
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:44,850
he doesn't mainly as a joke you know

1640
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:46,650
just cuz he can as opposed to something

1641
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:49,109
he's actively interested right like I

1642
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:51,180
learned to care a lot less about like my

1643
00:59:49,109 --> 00:59:53,130
appearance to others I learned to care a

1644
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:55,440
lot about less about like what I wear

1645
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:57,210
and I learned to keep focus on what I

1646
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,980
really care about you know whether it's

1647
00:59:57,210 --> 01:00:00,960
like my stream whether it's my

1648
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:04,830
relationships my friends my roommates

1649
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:07,440
are it's helped me focus a lot in terms

1650
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:09,420
of like what can I do to get stuff done

1651
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,850
and just ignore everything else cuz I

1652
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:14,130
think I think that's made me a lot less

1653
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:15,390
like I guess stressed about a lot of

1654
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:17,310
different things a lot of people come to

1655
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:19,050
me with problems and I'm just like do

1656
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:20,340
you want me to like actually solve them

1657
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:22,170
for you or do you want me to like just

1658
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:23,910
be a listening like person cuz like I'm

1659
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:24,240
really bad at being able to do both at

1660
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:26,340
once

1661
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:28,350
so like I try to have them clarify

1662
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:29,910
that's actually a really good question

1663
01:00:28,350 --> 01:00:31,890
to ask people because I found like I

1664
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:34,410
always try to solve problems exactly

1665
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:37,020
people don't want like this one a year

1666
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:39,660
exactly you know that's actually very

1667
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:43,500
important to learn yeah yeah be a good

1668
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:46,800
good listener sometimes and so yeah I

1669
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:49,710
