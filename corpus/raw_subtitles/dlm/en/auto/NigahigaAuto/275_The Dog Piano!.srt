00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,090
hey guys so as many of you already know

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:05,790
I am NOT the most musically gifted

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,170
person but I do love music and recently

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,480
I've been trying to teach myself how to

5
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,740
play the piano not with real lessons or

6
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,360
like with a teacher or anything I've

7
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,889
been just like youtubing people playing

8
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,150
the piano and I just like copy their

9
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:16,710
hands pretty sure that's how people

10
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,210
learn right honestly I don't even know

11
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,890
how to read notes but anyway whenever I

12
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,600
try to practice playing the piano my

13
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,400
dogs for whatever is it it doesn't

14
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,289
matter where they are in the house they

15
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,060
come and they just they just go crazy

16
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:28,230
they just start barking so loud that I

17
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,000
can't even hear the piano I mean that

18
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:50,219
literally like scares me sometimes it

19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:51,629
makes me not want to play it see I don't

20
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,789
know if you can tell how loud those

21
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:55,590
barks are from the video but trust me it

22
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,690
is loud and the thing is if I ignore

23
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,520
them and I keep playing Roku for

24
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,140
whatever reason it gets even louder by

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:15,420
doing this like you just like turned

26
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:16,680
into this really high pitch like cat see

27
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,330
I don't know if it's because I play the

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,420
piano so well that they want to sing

29
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:24,420
along or because I'm so bad that they

30
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,400
they want me to stop probably probably

31
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,350
that but regardless they will not let me

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,869
practice so one day I decided if they're

33
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,610
not gonna let me practice the piano then

34
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:34,140
I'm just gonna turn them into one so

35
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,869
everything you're about to hear is 100%

36
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,240
Marlee and Roku barking and doing that

37
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:42,270
high-pitched cat scream thing I'm not

38
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:46,579
sure why I did this but it's um it's

39
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,579
done this is the dog piano
