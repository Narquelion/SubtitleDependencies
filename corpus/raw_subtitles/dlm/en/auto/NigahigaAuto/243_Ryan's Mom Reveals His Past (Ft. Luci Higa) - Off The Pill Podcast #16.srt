I'm gonna start

48
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:18,370
thinking about what to ask like what

49
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:21,130
kind of questions do I have but um this

50
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:23,200
is different for me this was your idea

51
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,480
it was it was good I thought that this

52
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,910
would be a pretty fun episode for

53
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,580
Mother's Day not a lot of people

54
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:32,500
actually ever get to see auntie Lucy on

55
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:35,190
camera she's on the camera a bit no ugly

56
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,160

62
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,480

63
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:04,990

64
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:10,630

73
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:27,420

happy Mother's Day thank you Paco yeah

75
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:33,250
[Laughter]

76
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:35,470
but uh yeah how about how about we just

77
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:38,500
go into a little bit of it you know

78
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:41,140
introduce yourself you know you're

79
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,660
Ryan's mom but what else do you do for

80
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,370
the company cuz a lot of people actually

81
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,810
the superfans kind of know a little bit

82
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,130
but there's a lot of stuff that you do

83
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,709
behind the scenes that you don't you

84
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:53,680
know ever show on camera oh it's really

85
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:55,660
Cullen boring but I didn't want to know

86
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,160
still so it's not your choice if it's

87
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,070
boring or not we want to know the boring

88
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:03,100
stuff I just like to think of myself as

89
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:04,930
I'm just helping behind the scenes I

90
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,820
don't like to be in front of the camera

91
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,680
so I'll just be like behind the scenes

92
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,769
whatever you guys yes and trust me I

93
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,810
tried many times you know I mean like

94
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:15,130
heavy used to use his dad Kevin B's uses

95
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,930
his dad all the time and that every

96
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:20,049
video that he did with him worked really

97
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:21,820
well and then you know and your parents

98
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:24,370
kind of the opposite no they don't they

99
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:27,490
would not she would not well actually my

100
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:30,819
dad is worse he refuses to be you know

101
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:32,050
to trick him to be into some stuff but

102
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:32,530
she does she really doesn't like it

103
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,889
either

104
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:39,460
why is that what's your issue I don't I

105
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:41,440
don't like the way I look on camera you

106
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,849
know I don't like pictures and then I

107
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,069
don't think I sound good you know I

108
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:46,479
don't think like how about nice for you

109
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:48,940
I don't like the way I sound

110
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,539
most people are like that yeah except

111
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,940
for Paco

112
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:53,680
he's like so actually I didn't like the

113
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,270
way I sounded either when I was first

114
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,419
like editing my own videos I was like

115
00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:00,820
this sound what I learned is that the

116
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:02,500
reason why we're not used to hearing how

117
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,020
we actually sound is because in our

118
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,310
heads our skulls act as like tuning

119
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,780
devices though yep

120
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:10,120
so John's different yeah we sound

121
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,650
different yep so that's why when we hear

122
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,710
something how we actually sound like

123
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:15,759
whoa I know it's not how I imagined yeah

124
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,340
exactly

125
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,880
so yes I don't like that and then I

126
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:24,159
don't like to act so like I don't mind

127
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,259
this cuz I feel like you're just talking

128
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:27,789
I'm just talking yeah or like that rap

129
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:34,180
video like I thought it was just playing

130
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:36,130
a game or sometimes yeah so I mean it

131
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:39,370
was okay I was just being a good sport

132
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:42,190
yeah you're a great sport it was making

133
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:45,190
my mom rap like Eminem yeah for those at

134
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:48,419
and that video was so funny when the

135
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:51,280
vacuum cleaner turns into the guy

136
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:53,169
Larry's but uh how about let's let's go

137
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,349
and I think this is kind of gonna be

138
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:58,330
almost like a long Twitter type of

139
00:05:56,349 --> 00:06:01,090
question yeah I mean there was a lot of

140
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,710
good questions yeah there and I just you

141
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:05,130
know we're gonna find out a little bit

142
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:08,860
more about Ryan's childhood really yes

143
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:10,270
yeah and your parenting tactics Wow

144
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,039
and you know we got to go kind of edgy

145
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,719
at first though did you spank him as a

146
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:18,280
kid

147
00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:21,310
I must have because Charlie talking only

148
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:24,430
goes so far but I wasn't like a wooden

149
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:26,830
spoon or I mean was I even like a ruler

150
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:29,320
I think you did use a wooden spoon no

151
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:32,949
you were more of a like pull your ear

152
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:34,990
like hey yeah and so my erection you do

153
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:37,169
that because you can't see there's no

154
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,169
like

155
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:44,220
you know like if you hide you might get

156
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:46,980
a bruise just pinched it here just a

157
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,600
little redness it'll go away he's

158
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,450
abusive now in today's day and age

159
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,430
that's considered child abuse know who

160
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:55,860
is worse though you are uncle Wendell I

161
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:59,250
think it was equal except that I think

162
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:01,110
his level like you know he's a little

163
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:05,760
bit more tolerant maybe like I'll go

164
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:07,950
from like here to there I'd be like talk

165
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,470
talk and then okay and then it's like

166
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:15,920
that's it zero two hundred is black and

167
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:19,950
white for you yeah yeah and then also

168
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:22,110
what I guess in Ryan like growing up

169
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:24,150
because you guys are kind of similar in

170
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:27,000
the aspect that you both have ADHD right

171
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:29,190
yeah and so you saw yourself a lot of

172
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,680
yourself in him actually though I think

173
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:34,350
only when he got diagnosed then it was

174
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,470
like oh wow that's how I was you know

175
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:41,160
like when people talk after like really

176
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:42,600
focus otherwise I'm not listening and so

177
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,020
it's bad when he and I go to a meeting

178
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,400
because I know he's not listening

179
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:50,160
listening I just don't know how much I

180
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:53,910
retain right I'm like I have to be like

181
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:56,370
like really he might not be listening

182
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:58,590
you know but it's just interesting I'll

183
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:01,110
remember it but I think it's it's it's

184
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:03,840
good to know that you are because when

185
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:05,040
you recognize it then you know what you

186
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,310
need to how you have to adjust herself

187
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:10,230
yeah like him I hate to read hmm I mean

188
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:12,930
I just I just can't read through a whole

189
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:14,910
book mm-hm yeah you're not much of a

190
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,410
reader Ryan's not much of a listener as

191
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,820
soon as Ryan has his phone out I know I

192
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:25,470
should just stop talking because he's

193
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:26,760
not paying attention what yeah so going

194
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,380
into that going into a meeting together

195
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,360
I think a lot of people don't know this

196
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,920
not so behind the scenes cuz you didn't

197
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,080
really go specifically into what you do

198
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,760
but you are like an acting manager for

199
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,350
him right yeah but I don't like to say

200
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,540
am i I'm isn't manage I don't like you

201
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:42,690
saying what's your job because I don't

202
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:45,510
manage him I mean I I do things that

203
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:47,340
make his job easier or gives him time to

204
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:50,430
do what he needs to do which is like

205
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:51,790
create right yeah so I do all of the

206
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,400
other things all you know

207
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,960
business side of it and then like when

208
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,750
you guys come I know he's not gonna cook

209
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:01,840
so I'll cook threefold yeah make the

210
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:04,270
snacks clean up you know he doesn't have

211
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:10,180
time for that so aunty is kind of like a

212
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:13,380
manager caterer accountant what hust

213
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:19,270
actually an accountant retired now right

214
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:20,560
and when you retired were you still uh I

215
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:22,690
guess was Ryan

216
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,270
when did you start kind of like helping

217
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:28,780
him out on the business aspect so I

218
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:31,480
think um it was good because we kind of

219
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:34,270
grew together right like we both knew

220
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:37,750
nothing of YouTube and so we kind of

221
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:39,280
like learn together so I think it it was

222
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,780
kind of helpful for the relationship

223
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,000
because it wasn't like I knew more than

224
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:45,250
him he didn't know more than me and so

225
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,930
we kind of just help each other along

226
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:50,080
the way so it was it was pretty good and

227
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:52,630
a lot of mistakes were made but learning

228
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:56,260
experience exactly

229
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:58,990
and with that you know because a lot a

230
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:01,090
lot of especially Asian parents would

231
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:04,060
not allow their child to go in something

232
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:05,080
in like a creative aspect but because

233
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,150
you guys were growing together do you

234
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,950
think that helped or what helped you be

235
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:12,490
more understanding and leaning of

236
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:16,150
letting your son go into this when your

237
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:18,520
other better son Kyle is a an x-ray

238
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:22,780
technician right right and he like

239
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:26,140
completed he graduated and you know he

240
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:28,660
is about to get married and he has a

241
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:31,510
career I mean he caused I don't know

242
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,740
Kyle I think caused a better child well

243
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,240
first of all you're not supposed to

244
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,160
compare Paco

245
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,720
when you become a parent you should not

246
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,120
appear your children that's funny no I

247
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,400
got better grades than him in school

248
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:46,630
yeah but he was the better dude over

249
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:51,670
he was Tamagotchi an underachiever yep

250
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:53,620
he could have been like like so much so

251
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:56,560
much better at you know he could have

252
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:59,680
like even even two so he got his extra

253
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,970
Tech and then he's debating or sure to

254
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,140
get his nuke man and I'm like oh you

255
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,990
should get your new command you know

256
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:09,040
because I mean what's two more years

257
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:10,420
and he's like nuclear medicine degrees

258
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,940
right for those that don't know what

259
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:15,160
nuke med is basically it's an extra two

260
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,840
years of schooling right yeah so you

261
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,210
know he'd be the type like and I just

262
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:23,260
say it was 5050 because he's a type two

263
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:24,820
like I'm satisfied yeah you know but in

264
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:27,700
fact that's what Ryan was gonna go into

265
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:30,640
first and then yes so when he dropped

266
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,680
out I guess what was making you so like

267
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,570
understanding and accepting of that cuz

268
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,210
your first kid was like went through the

269
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,690
usual you know school career all that

270
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,850
stuff

271
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:41,170
oh no you still you still want I still

272
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:43,600
want it we still wanted him to go to

273
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:45,610
school you know it's not like we said

274
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,490
like oh yeah go for it you know but I

275
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:51,400
think it's a parent's well the way we

276
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:56,260
think is that you want your kid to do

277
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:58,090
something that they enjoy right and so

278
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:01,210
you force your kid to do something and

279
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:03,040
what if they hate it but you but you

280
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:05,200
also as a parent want to tell them the

281
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,900
downside of what it is you know so I

282
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,320
remember I told him well you know if you

283
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:12,550
do this and it ends and you go back to

284
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,130
college or your friends are all

285
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:20,020
graduated they'd be working and he's

286
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:22,900
like yeah it's like okay well you know

287
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:25,330
you know you just give them the downside

288
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:28,870
cuz that's all you can do as long as you

289
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:30,190
make them aware and it's a part of your

290
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,800
job is to just give them guidance you

291
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:35,080
know but really you just want them to do

292
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,360
what they want to do and then support

293
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,370
them how about for you Ryan like at what

294
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,590
point were you like no I think this can

295
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,970
really be a thing for me like did you

296
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:44,320
have to do a lot of persuading for her

297
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:47,980
or was it more just like I'm gonna show

298
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,110
no I mean I I it took me cuz I doubt I'm

299
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,700
like very conservative with like I don't

300
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:54,280
take a lot of risk you know and I knew

301
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:56,740
the safe path was to just go and get my

302
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,570
degree like Kyle and I was gonna get

303
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,640
into nuclear medicine I just thought it

304
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:03,160
was so boring and like I just didn't

305
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,410
like it but it wasn't a lot of her like

306
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:08,170
it was more me coming to that point I

307
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,640
wasn't like I wouldn't I'm not the kind

308
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,160
of person to take that risk without

309
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,890
something to fall back on you know and I

310
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,440
think I think in his situation he was so

311
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:19,270
like frustrated and he was so stressed

312
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,520
because he was still doing YouTube

313
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:23,890
and then trying to study and then they

314
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,680
were like brands coming to us and you

315
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:28,930
know like calling and you know people

316
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,670
like calling contacting him and so it

317
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:32,560
was really stressful so I kind of like

318
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:36,400
he had to do one or the other you know

319
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:40,540
you had to make a choice yeah and at

320
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:44,010
what point I guess were you completely

321
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:46,540
okay with all right you know I he is

322
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:48,460
financially stable you know that I'll

323
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,350
have to worry or you don't want do you

324
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,720
want him to go back to college still no

325
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:55,090
no I mean like in the beginning it was

326
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,120
actually there was no earnings in the

327
00:13:55,090 --> 00:14:00,760
beginning yeah yeah cuz that was like

328
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,010
2009 before Adsense right kind of well

329
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,170
there was ad since but it was hardly any

330
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,810
advertising I'd even know about it like

331
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:09,130
the partnership program was like not

332
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:11,620
things people knew about like only

333
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:15,130
certain youtubers got access to that in

334
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:17,920
the beginning I would say like 99% of

335
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:19,120
people did not know about it like did

336
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,310
not know that you could even make money

337
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,920
off of you off of you know posting

338
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:27,490
YouTube videos so at the time it was a

339
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,780
bigger risk but you could still like

340
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,550
still there were some ads and stuff

341
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:33,550
coming in like in terms of like product

342
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:36,490
placement and stuff so it was a it was a

343
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:38,470
risk but it's not quite like hey you

344
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:40,030
know let's go and just do this thing and

345
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:41,200
there's no money in it like follow your

346
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:43,900
dreams kind of think there was some

347
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:47,110
money in it but we didn't know yeah it

348
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:50,800
was gonna get so big you know I mean it

349
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:52,600
got big like maybe after 2010 yeah and

350
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,600
so in the beginning they were it's

351
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,550
really no money but you could just see

352
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,670
how stress he was so it was kind of like

353
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:03,400
he couldn't go like do both he had to

354
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:06,310
make a choice plus I was here like in

355
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:08,200
the dorms at UNLV where like you have no

356
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:10,600
privacy and make for one that's already

357
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:13,060
stressful like to even make videos was

358
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,950
like not common people like I mean it

359
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:17,500
was embarrassing you know and to be like

360
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:19,360
oh you're with living with someone so

361
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:22,510
you I have to literally wait until he's

362
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,130
gone to make my videos for one and then

363
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:27,910
we have suite mates so it's like two

364
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:28,990
rooms and there's two people in each

365
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:32,230
room and you guys share a bathroom

366
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:33,110
that's between the two rooms and yeah

367
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,120
essentially

368
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,860
like there's like no time where there

369
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,750
was like silence and so I would have to

370
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,730
go you know off campus and I was to film

371
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:43,070
some stuff if it was in my room then I'd

372
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:45,829
have to wait you know you're not just

373
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:49,070
working on your own schedule plus their

374
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:51,230
school you know so it was a very uh not

375
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:52,730
an ideal situation for either for both

376
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,370
it was like either one is gonna suffer

377
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:58,339
so it was to me it was an easier

378
00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:00,560
decision um and then when I brought

379
00:15:58,339 --> 00:16:01,700
brought it up to them I was like

380
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,529
surprised because I thought there was

381
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,790
gonna be more pushback it wasn't like

382
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:06,560
the stories that you hear from a lot of

383
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,790
other like a so-called Asian parents I

384
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,230
think a lot of parents would feel the

385
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:11,930
same but it wasn't it wasn't like

386
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:13,970
dramatic but I also think because we

387
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:15,200
come from Hawaii it's a little bit

388
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:18,440
different from us because we do have

389
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:20,149
Asian parents but I guess the whole way

390
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,470
culture you guys are more like lenient

391
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:22,579
and understanding of different things

392
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:25,040
you know you're not necessarily you're

393
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:27,019
talking like first-generation Asian pear

394
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,910
yeah yeah it's like this is the model

395
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:31,040
you follow yeah she's like she has I

396
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:33,079
mean you can just other than a Hawaiian

397
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,640
like pidgin accent she doesn't have an

398
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:36,890
accent and she's like what do you third

399
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:40,459
generation third because you're your

400
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:43,220
grandfather I can write to Hawaii so

401
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:45,470
even my grandparents don't have accents

402
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:50,209
right well pidgin well they were born in

403
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:51,410
Hawaii yeah yeah and I guess because so

404
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:53,990
you were born in Hawaii right big on

405
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:56,690
right and uh and you have kind of a

406
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:59,779
bigger family right when you were

407
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:02,390
growing up what parallels do you see

408
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:03,500
similar to Ryan growing up so you know

409
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,880
we could get to know a little bit more

410
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,549
about you get to know a little bit more

411
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,380
about Ryan because we touched on it a

412
00:17:07,549 --> 00:17:12,260
little bit you said that you as well

413
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:14,030
have ADHD right mm-hmm so like when you

414
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,280
were growing up and you saw Ryan growing

415
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:20,809
up like what did you see similarities a

416
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:23,900
lot of for you did you punch girls in

417
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:30,950
the stomach no but you know what I did

418
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:33,169
hit a boy I was older I wasn't like

419
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:35,000
kindergarten what my dad tells me I

420
00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:37,970
don't quite remember but you know that's

421
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,830
what he told me is the boy's father came

422
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:42,429
to our house like I think he was Asian

423
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,429
also

424
00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:50,179
understand okay no because the culture

425
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:52,999
yeah I mean it's not like I was doing it

426
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:54,889
because I hated him or anything I think

427
00:17:52,999 --> 00:17:56,509
I think he either like he must have

428
00:17:54,889 --> 00:17:58,850
harassed me or something I don't know

429
00:17:56,509 --> 00:18:01,309
what it was it had to be like around I'd

430
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:03,950
say second grade but I remember that

431
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:06,249
where did you punch him no I did I don't

432
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:08,840
even know like how I hit him but I

433
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:12,519
vaguely remember or yet a dad came to

434
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:15,710
our house I mean I know who the boy is

435
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:21,619
and he still is in Hilo that's a small

436
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:24,019
town no I didn't know sheep I see they

437
00:18:21,619 --> 00:18:29,059
can't this back when I was a kid a kid

438
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:31,639
ago you know parents can't tell they're

439
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:33,649
bad so there's so much stuff no no the

440
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:35,840
thing is there's so many stars right

441
00:18:33,649 --> 00:18:37,909
like like you have so many stories we

442
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,039
have so many stories but it doesn't just

443
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:41,299
come out yes someone has to dig it out

444
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:43,100
right you know there has to be like a

445
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:45,169
situation that and the time that the

446
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,669
teacher called the house that Ryan punch

447
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:50,059
the role in the stomach we are bright

448
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:52,669
with everyone it's like Uncle window

449
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:54,529
yeah I've got the car dad yeah but maybe

450
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:55,060
if I got the call maybe I would I had a

451
00:18:54,529 --> 00:18:59,379
flashback

452
00:18:55,060 --> 00:19:06,200
[Laughter]

453
00:18:59,379 --> 00:19:09,830
but I know that the boy he either like

454
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:12,289
chased me or he did something to me and

455
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:15,409
I'd four brothers so it's kinda like I

456
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:18,379
was tomboy then oh yeah I was I was in

457
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:20,899
fact my dad was kind of worried that I

458
00:19:18,379 --> 00:19:24,350
would be like totally like tomboy mmm

459
00:19:20,899 --> 00:19:30,559
yeah I'm four brothers you know yeah you

460
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:33,679
have a really big family at people have

461
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:35,359
less like families have shrunk our main

462
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,669
other than like Mormon families I guess

463
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:39,200
but like in general like oh yeah it was

464
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:41,059
common to have like five brothers right

465
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,710
and we're like a bunch of siblings yeah

466
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:45,649
because back then that's all they had

467
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:47,179
you know there was no entertainment will

468
00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:48,980
you do when you're bored you know I

469
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:51,649
don't know if that's what it is I think

470
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:53,330
like they came from big families so it

471
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:54,889
was okay you know what I mean but now

472
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:56,990
when you have when you have children

473
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:59,360
it's kind of like you think that economy

474
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:02,210
yes and what a college costs and you

475
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,700
know so just different like I mean even

476
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:07,580
like our generation most of us like we

477
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,830
worked to pay for college you know but

478
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:11,840
now we pay for parents pay for college

479
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:13,970
but that's because also you could work

480
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,320
and pay for college and not be in like

481
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:18,070
huge amounts of debt how could you guys

482
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,140
[Music]

483
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:24,020
but you know a lot of times like we yeah

484
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,820
I think we did spoil our kids you know

485
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:28,760
our generation but it's because we

486
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:30,380
didn't have have it easy so you know we

487
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,330
want to do whatever it can give them

488
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:34,820
whatever we can because we didn't get it

489
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:36,230
yeah I know but speaking on that uh I

490
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:39,970
just reminded me when you're talking

491
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:43,220
about I guess who was the more

492
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:45,980
disciplinary one yeah I think it was her

493
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:47,390
because I do remember like and I only

494
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,070
know this this story because I don't

495
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:50,540
remember it specifically but I do know

496
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:52,429
that though anytime I can really think

497
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:55,309
of that my dad really yelled a really

498
00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:58,070
disciplined was that time when I

499
00:20:55,309 --> 00:20:59,420
supposedly I guess he yelled at me and

500
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:01,070
said they told me that I don't really

501
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:03,260
remember too much by I punched the girl

502
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:05,150
right for cutting me in line so I push

503
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:07,880
her in the stomach she dropped a lot of

504
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:09,350
power behind this you know I was in

505
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,429
kindergarten and then I guess I got sent

506
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:13,010
to the principal's office they called

507
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:14,960
home when I went home my dad was the one

508
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:17,150
to you know normally she would be the

509
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,070
one yelling or spanking or whatever it

510
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,600
is but apparently he was the one who had

511
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:23,090
to deal with me and I don't really

512
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,740
remember I have no real unless I blocked

513
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:27,080
it out I have no real memories of him

514
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:30,410
really you know disciplining me but

515
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:32,929
supposedly he gave me a big I don't know

516
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:34,640
what he did yelling he's gonna make me

517
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:38,270
cry why didn't you cry but you wouldn't

518
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:40,580
cry yeah yeah yes prior I thought I was

519
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:42,620
right but you're never you're not really

520
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,890
a crier cuz my I tried to make him cry

521
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:46,280
too

522
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:50,540
you know his parents you should try to

523
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:53,420
make your kids because you kind of want

524
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:56,059
to get a reaction right you know either

525
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:58,220
like yell back and and Kyle and Ryan I

526
00:21:56,059 --> 00:22:00,950
used to hate it because when I used to

527
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:03,230
lecture them they'd never contest like

528
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:07,880
they'd always be like okay I'll be like

529
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:09,650
you know okay and I'd be like you know

530
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,440
you kind of worth it but that's that's

531
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:11,789
the

532
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,440
you know how male and female yeah

533
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:15,570
females we like to like keep going

534
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,909
because you want to see that they're

535
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:19,200
engaged in the conversation not only

536
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:26,940
that but I guess you want to get the

537
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:27,149
last word and they say okay shuts you

538
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,389
down

539
00:22:27,149 --> 00:22:34,350
it does it does so you kind of want him

540
00:22:30,389 --> 00:22:36,840
yeah I remember the time that you didn't

541
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:39,929
remember like he told my dad used to

542
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,370
take pick him after school my dad used

543
00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:41,940
to pick him up and then take him to

544
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,740
basketball

545
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,590
doesn't the taste you know he hated

546
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,480
basketball and judo and so he would give

547
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:50,639
my father like all these excuses have a

548
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,950
stomachache headache whatever and then I

549
00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:54,620
find out later that oh he didn't go

550
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:57,899
because or he had stomachache

551
00:22:54,620 --> 00:23:00,419
it's just like fueling so we went home

552
00:22:57,899 --> 00:23:02,909
and I told him you know if you think

553
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:05,460
that you're like smart enough like you

554
00:23:02,909 --> 00:23:06,840
can make your own decisions then I'm

555
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,190
gonna pack your bags and you go to

556
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,779
grandpa's and you make all your

557
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:13,830
decisions and you're thinking oh he's

558
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:16,110
gonna cry just like it's just like sits

559
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:18,539
there he doesn't cry you know so I pack

560
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:20,490
up this little bag and I and I leave it

561
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:21,870
and I'm waiting for him to like tell me

562
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:25,379
something you know or come back with

563
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:30,330
something he doesn't go back into his

564
00:23:25,379 --> 00:23:32,940
room so what you understand you know

565
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:33,960
he's like okay and so then I tell him

566
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,309
because I have to get the last word

567
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,960
right cuz he said okay

568
00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:40,590
something okay why I'm leaving this bag

569
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,529
right here so it's a reminder you're not

570
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:45,299
old enough to make your own decision if

571
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:47,970
you're supposed to go basketball you're

572
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:52,559
going to basketball well I don't

573
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:55,769
remember that one but make sense sounds

574
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:59,730
like me I guess uh I guess we're talking

575
00:23:55,769 --> 00:24:04,679
about a lot about the bad things but how

576
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:07,919
about you know each other dad I think I

577
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:12,179
was justified she cut me in line he was

578
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:14,250
challenging but that in a way was that

579
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:16,230
something that you saw positive in your

580
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:17,429
son oh for sure like where were some

581
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:20,129
other traits about him that you

582
00:24:17,429 --> 00:24:21,059
recognize like oh no there's like a lot

583
00:24:20,129 --> 00:24:22,830
of good things about it did you ever

584
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,660
recognize oh he he's gonna do great

585
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:26,390
things or did

586
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,800
noticed like oh he's a good kid did you

587
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:30,290
ever think he would have the influence

588
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:32,870
that he has you know on a lot of

589
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:34,460
people's lives oh no definitely I mean

590
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:36,740
we didn't even see this whole YouTube

591
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:39,440
thing yeah I mean that was like total

592
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:42,140
shock because and I think the first time

593
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,560
we realized it is you and Shawn made

594
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:47,480
rivo mm-hmm there was this like

595
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:49,700
nonprofit organization in Hilo and they

596
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,620
know I guess it's part of like a bigger

597
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:56,210
organization but they were called Revo

598
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:59,240
and there was a myspace contest that if

599
00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:02,300
they got so many I don't know what it

600
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:05,060
was like sore throats or something and

601
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:06,290
then they could win like $20,000 or

602
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:11,390
$10,000

603
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:13,850
yeah and so um he did a video he and

604
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:15,440
Shawn did a video and they Juan and then

605
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:16,250
I was like and you know these are people

606
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,230
all over the world

607
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:21,230
voting for him for these people in Hilo

608
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:23,360
so I was like I told him why Ryan you

609
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:25,310
you actually make a difference in the

610
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,910
world you know and folks were like high

611
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:29,090
school

612
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:31,520
yeah right like 15 probably yeah that

613
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:35,840
was quite a surprise that he's able to

614
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:38,120
like was able to reach people and people

615
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,280
like you know yeah when it came to like

616
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,720
you actually saw that it made money for

617
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,750
someone and it was a good organization

618
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,220
like it was it promoting art and um they

619
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:49,160
had like art shows and stuff and it was

620
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:50,810
a good nonprofit I think so yeah that

621
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,250
was like pretty cool but at the time we

622
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:53,840
didn't think I mean we didn't think much

623
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,950
Shana I didn't think much of anything oh

624
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,430
they're asking for something I guess

625
00:25:54,950 --> 00:26:00,440
yeah and it was a funny video - yeah it

626
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:01,550
was just like oh yeah I guess back then

627
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:06,440
and people just threw up whatever they

628
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:07,910
wanted yeah no but it was funny to be

629
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,180
honest what did you guys do with that

630
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:12,440
money

631
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:16,030
no we so people had to go on MySpace and

632
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:18,710
vote for them oh yeah and then they won

633
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:20,900
yeah so that was like impressive and

634
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:23,240
they actually made a difference you know

635
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:28,570
so that uh that's when you kind of saw

636
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,570
like oh yeah yeah she's not a normal kid

637
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:35,270
I just think that he had like kid look

638
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:37,130
at my beard I just think yes he has an

639
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:39,890
effect on people you know

640
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:42,140
that that was quite a surprise and then

641
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:47,030
I think the next in a couple years after

642
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:51,640
that there was a boy he's like haha like

643
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:52,940
half Japanese half Dutch and he lived in

644
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,790
Curacao

645
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:57,620
and he actually asked his parents to

646
00:26:55,790 --> 00:27:00,800
bring him to Hilo so he could meet Ryan

647
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:02,570
so he was bullied in school because you

648
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:13,040
know I guess like there's hardly any

649
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:14,900
Asians and so he was instructed she was

650
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:21,230
too far from the mic just so people are

651
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:23,960
wondering so he he watched Ryan's videos

652
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:27,920
yeah he seems to be like really like I

653
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:30,140
don't know how bad he felt but he was

654
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,850
bullied right he was pretty amazed like

655
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,940
this how old was he he must've been like

656
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:36,200
a little like nine year old or something

657
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:40,460
as this young kid and he looked very

658
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:43,250
depressed and yeah I just remember we

659
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:46,660
had to I get no idea you were talking to

660
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:51,320
the mom I guess she contacted the paper

661
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:54,860
what she contact the newspaper Oh what

662
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:57,800
yes so in order to get to to contact you

663
00:27:54,860 --> 00:28:01,130
oh she wrote into the newspaper asking

664
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:03,650
if she probably told her story about her

665
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:05,810
son and how he was bullied and he goes

666
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:07,010
no and he the only time she heard him

667
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:10,310
laugh was when he was watching his

668
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:11,450
videos and so you know she wanted to say

669
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:13,760
that they were making a trip to Hawaii

670
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:18,260
and he really wants to meet Ryan and so

671
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:20,900
the newspaper contacted us the local you

672
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:23,870
know paper yeah so he actually came to

673
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:26,750
Hilo and then we got together met him at

674
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:28,730
Starbucks I think yeah yeah so that was

675
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:31,940

like it almost didn't say anything yeah

678
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:38,600
just like looking down the whole time

679
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:40,640
but the real cool thing is that like I

680
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:45,530

703
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:38,659

was saying like even when he went to

712
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,900
Japan I think like he doesn't look like

713
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,669
yeah doesn't look like cuz he's mixed he

714
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,230
doesn't really look like wherever he was

715
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:05,659
and then when he was watching your

716
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:08,809

00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:13,849
Ryan was so little so I didn't know like

811
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:17,030
how long it was going on but I remember

812
00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:19,909
one day I came home from work and then

813
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:22,849
Ryan said you know Kyle he punched me or

814
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:24,560
something that eyes like ran into Kyle I

815
00:34:22,849 --> 00:34:26,540

817
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,540
you know he probably did it again and

818
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:32,330
again but I was like don't you ever

819
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:34,429
touch him yeah we we fought physically a

820
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:35,869
lot so when I was like I don't remember

821
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:39,349
this but when I was a kid apparently I

822
00:34:35,869 --> 00:34:42,379
stabbed him with a weed digger my rabbi

823
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:43,700
is or something you know I go we do I

824
00:34:42,379 --> 00:34:45,649
like three years or two years old or

825
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,700
something like that so I it has like a

826
00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:49,389
little you know you know what we figure

827
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:52,040
is right dad he's like a little scholar

828
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:53,419
and then I also heard I don't remember

829
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,490
this but I don't know how or what I was

830
00:34:53,419 --> 00:34:58,300
but I had to go to hospital ones cuz he

831
00:34:55,490 --> 00:35:01,119
was the he put your arm out of my sake

832
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:05,490
yeah ell boy or something like that yeah

833
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,490
dislocated my arm as a good kid swinging

834
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:15,100
I know I never liked like I wouldn't

835
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:17,290
back down to him like if he hit me or

836
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:19,630
like did something that hurt me I was

837
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:21,220
like I'm gonna return tenfold like

838
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:23,260
whatever you do if it's a pinch I'm

839
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:26,140
giving you like a punch if it's a punch

840
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:27,190
I'm gonna stab you in the eye because it

841
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:29,290
was just like it was just like you're

842
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:32,080
not gonna get the best of me yeah yeah

843
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:33,550
you're not gonna get the okay because he

844
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,830
was always like like she said he was

845
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:37,330
naturally good he's well as people that

846
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:39,700
you just hate because they're always

847
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:42,190
good at stuff that you have to work hard

848
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:44,950
for you know yeah like for like judo and

849
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:47,860
stuff like he got we both play second in

850
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:49,630
the state but like he did not train

851
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,890
there's I mean he trained we went to

852
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:52,420
practice but he didn't train like all I

853
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:55,180
trained yeah you know for like

854
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:57,430
everything I worked really hard compared

855
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:59,170
to him but he was just naturally good

856
00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:00,700
and that was the most irritating thing

857
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,900
in the world to me people who like and

858
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,359
there's you know people like that I'm

859
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:05,710
sure yeah that's me yeah you were yeah

860
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:07,210
you're a good example you're someone

861
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:10,030
who's naturally good at a lot of things

862
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:10,720
which makes you lazy super I'm pretty

863
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:16,330
much Kyle

864
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:19,090
so mom kinda was the firstborn thing no

865
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:21,760
I think it's your your personality like

866
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:23,350
he was so laid back yeah but if I was

867
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,330
laid back I would be so bad at

868
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:27,369
everything

869
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:29,140
he was just mastering everything nobody

870
00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:30,970
think like as a second child though it

871
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,500
makes you more competitive yeah you see

872
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:34,330
the second child is more competitive

873
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,970
because they see what the older child

874
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:38,410
did want to be better

875
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:40,359
you and your sister were like are like

876
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:43,359
best friends yeah but we didn't get

877
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:44,920
along a couple of times too she took a

878
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,660
lot of things for granted like she would

879
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,590
take for granted me driving her around

880
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:49,030
and stuff

881
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:52,300
and like she wouldn't like care about me

882
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:53,650
or anything I remember as a young kid

883
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,940
one time I don't know if I told this

884
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:57,150
story here I tell this story a lot

885
00:36:54,940 --> 00:37:00,510
because it's probably my favorite one

886
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:04,000
but we were in the backseat of a car

887
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:05,440
after a soccer game and she was sleeping

888
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,660
and just had her mouth open and she was

889
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,340
like sleeping look like that and I was

890
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,660
eating eating an egg salad sandwich and

891
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:18,470
I saw her and I just put a big

892
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:29,690
egg egg on her tongue as she's sleeping

893
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:33,020
and then the car hit a bump at you oh my

894
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:34,640
goodness well no the best thing was when

895
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:35,930
Kyle went away to college I think then

896
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,400
it got better hmm

897
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:39,860
is that when you feel like you started

898
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:42,710
really connecting well that's we never I

899
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:44,560
mean we didn't become like close like oh

900
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:46,760
you guys are we just didn't fight so

901
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,560
naturally we started getting like we

902
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,660
could be in the same room before like we

903
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,390
couldn't really even but I think even up

904
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:56,060
until then you guys didn't really hardly

905
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:57,620
talk and then I left then it was like at

906
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,340
least they could like talk or play games

907
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:00,140
together

908
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:02,330
before I was like don't play with each

909
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:04,880
other don't even talk to each other I

910
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:08,320
was like yeah but now you guys are like

911
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,760
pretty close yeah yeah I guess I mean

912
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:14,780
yeah yeah much better

913
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:17,240
that's real convincing it's not like I

914
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:18,800
go to you know I like some siblings

915
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,640
they're like best friends and yeah tell

916
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,430
each other everything

917
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:24,920
like I don't know what he did for the

918
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:26,930
past month like I'm sure you went to

919
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:31,040
work but like I don't know I don't call

920
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:33,200
him lived in the same house he didn't

921
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,720
even talk to [ __ ] yeah I'd be like

922
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,830
where's Kyle it's like I don't know and

923
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,230
then I find out like Kyle is in his

924
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:41,570
bedroom like it's like just a different

925
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:43,190
floor you know like and I think more so

926
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:46,490
boys and just a personality's like

927
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:49,490
they're not stalkers you know yeah so

928
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:52,280
texts now is the best thing hmm do you

929
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:56,840
guys have a family group text no no

930
00:38:52,280 --> 00:39:09,560
remember my dad he's gonna listen to

931
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:14,990
this he still says if you have an issue

932
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:17,000
just text me really he really can't text

933
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:20,630
but he knows how to make outgoing calls

934
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,220
now I will say that do you want to get

935
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:23,960
into some Twitter cues because there's

936
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:25,220

it was embarrassing I don't see it was

972
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:09,140
my favorite we have a favorite story

973
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:11,750
nobody it what was embarrassing is but

974
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:15,619
we have it in your book you know where

975
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:18,170
he taught the kindergarten teacher like

976
00:41:15,619 --> 00:41:20,599
he would actually like contest what she

977
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:23,180
would tell them to do you know and so

978
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:25,849
that was like so embarrassing I mean I

979
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:27,740
think I don't know how many parents go

980
00:41:25,849 --> 00:41:30,109
through this but normally you have like

981
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:32,750
a 10-15 minutes is a long parent-teacher

982
00:41:30,109 --> 00:41:36,800

992
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:03,630
appreciate that teacher because she

993
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:07,200

994
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:09,780

996
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:16,410
the podcasts excuse me yes I am well at

997
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:18,390
least I care to ask but yeah she like

998
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:20,280
really tried to understand him and

999
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:22,230
wasn't like the kind of person that

1000
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:24,390
would be like you know you go talk to

1001
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:25,800
the vice-principal you know what I mean

1002
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:27,630
yeah like push it off to someone else

1003
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,820
yeah exactly like just like you know my

1004
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:32,460
my my son is was like that you know

1005
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:35,910
she'd be like no you know we just have

1006
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:39,330
to treat him like he's an old man in a

1007
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:41,400
little boy's body because we would like

1008
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:44,370
contest her like if she would say

1009
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,660
something like if it was to sit on the

1010
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:46,620
floor and then somebody else is not

1011
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,820
setting up floor he'd be like well how

1012
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:50,490
come they're not sitting on the floor

1013
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:53,970
you know he'd be like contester and so

1014
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:55,800
um you know it almost sounds like a lot

1015
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:57,870
like a lot of people look up to Ryan and

1016
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:01,590
they see him as an idol but as a kid

1017
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:04,470
growing up until now like super

1018
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:06,510
troublemaker super ADHD not paying

1019
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:08,520
attention almost like if you saw him

1020
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:10,380
growing up you'd be like this kid is not

1021
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:13,500
gonna make it you know they're gonna end

1022
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:15,660
up selling drugs and like not having

1023
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,340
anything no but you know so I kind of

1024
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:20,580
look at it as you saw he was so strong

1025
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:22,440
minded that whatever he decided to do he

1026
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:24,240
was gonna like do it you know so he

1027
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,250
decided like he was gonna do well at

1028
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:29,640
wrestling he was gonna do well if he was

1029
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:31,650
gonna do judo he was gonna do do it do

1030
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:34,080
it well I'm not so sure about basketball

1031
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:37,350
though cuz you really hated and he

1032
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:41,250
really was not good well the thing is

1033
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:43,530
with judo I was awful at it right my

1034
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:44,820
whole like pretty much until like I

1035
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:47,580
would say high school yeah high school

1036
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:49,020
eighth grade cuz I hated it but I did my

1037
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:50,760
whole life I should be good at it but I

1038
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:52,560
was like pretty awful and then in high

1039
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,030
school I had fun so I was like oh this

1040
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:57,390
is

1041
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:59,970
and then I just became good I just tried

1042
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:01,890
actually try but then but and then all

1043
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:04,530
the techniques came back right yeah that

1044
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:05,940
knowledge kicked in and then yeah so it

1045
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:07,470
was good a nice I do remember like

1046
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,910
growing up and stuff like going because

1047
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:11,190
we'd have to go to tournaments being in

1048
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:14,370
a club yeah and I would like just not

1049
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:16,260
even try but that's a strong magnet part

1050
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:18,210
like if he was like I'm not gonna care

1051
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:19,590
he didn't care but if he was like I'm

1052
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:22,080
gonna do it good he's gonna do it good

1053
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:25,320
you know so he could be he was like his

1054
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:28,140
worst enemy to me yeah you did judo for

1055
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:32,870
a little bit I did as a kid and I my par

1056
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:32,870
you week I actually got second in States

1057
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:48,870
Oh like you know not like high school

1058
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:50,490
club clubs and then um I remember I did

1059
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:52,020
not like it cuz I would have a lot of

1060
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:53,910
headaches as a kid so getting thrown

1061
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:55,800
around my brain would rattle in my skull

1062
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:57,510
so I'd always get like headaches after

1063
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,190
practice and I told my mom I didn't want

1064
00:44:57,510 --> 00:45:01,140
to do it and she was like it's not once

1065
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:02,850
you get your blue belt you can quit so

1066
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:06,870
then that's that's when I tried super

1067
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:11,340
hard yeah well we had the same agreement

1068
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:15,690
but mine was black so the agreement was

1069
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:17,130
you had to do a martial art this is like

1070
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:18,510
from like young time you have to do a

1071
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:20,640
martial art and you have to do a team

1072
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:22,170
sport so it was like okay if you don't

1073
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,670
want to do basketball then you go to

1074
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:24,960
soccer it was like no I don't want to

1075
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:26,700
soccer okay then you don't want to do

1076
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,530
basketball you do baseball no I know

1077
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:31,290
into baseball okay then you gotta go

1078
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:32,910
basketball you know and so then it was

1079
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:34,740
like okay you don't want to go judo then

1080
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:37,350
you gotta go cut a tape but you start

1081
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:39,150
from wiped out oh okay no it in yeah no

1082
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:42,300
so it's kind of like that was kind of

1083
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:43,620
like kind of the rule dang I kind of

1084
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:46,470
want to go into one thing but we should

1085
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:47,910
stick to the Twitter questions well just

1086
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:50,100
go we can always come back to alright

1087
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:53,340
okay cuz I guess talking about that you

1088
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:55,530
know in the parenting aspect and you

1089
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:59,690
know it seemed like you had kind of like

1090
00:45:55,530 --> 00:46:01,890
a set goals that he had to accomplish

1091
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:03,490
and you know he was completing these

1092
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:05,920
goals and stuff

1093
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:08,710
earlier you also talked about how as a

1094
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:12,010
parent you know sometimes you want your

1095
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:14,740
kid you want your kid to be happy doing

1096
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:17,290
with what they're doing right so I think

1097
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:19,420
for a lot of kids especially who watch

1098
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:21,430
YouTube and you know maybe they want to

1099
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:22,660
go into a creative field or they want to

1100
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:24,700
go into a field that isn't necessarily

1101
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:27,820
approved by their parents what

1102
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:30,130
suggestions do both of you have to these

1103
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:31,360
kids where they can prove like oh you

1104
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:32,890
know this is how I can convince my

1105
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:35,170
parents to go into this field that I

1106
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:38,170
want to go into you're saying you're

1107
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:39,940
talking about you're asking what do you

1108
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:41,380
as a kid do you tell your parents to

1109
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:43,120
convince you to let you do YouTube as a

1110
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:44,160
career not no not YouTube a creative

1111
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:46,570
field

1112
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,250
so cuz you know a lot of people be like

1113
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:50,740
oh I wanna do YouTube those kids are

1114
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:52,630
dumb but like some people want to do you

1115
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:54,760
know like maybe they want to have a plan

1116
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:56,350
you have to have a plan like and then

1117
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,060
like she said give them the warnings

1118
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:59,440
like okay well you know most she would

1119
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:01,660
tell me all the time because I from a

1120
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,400
young kid age before YouTube I'll be

1121
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:05,140
like oh I want to be an actor and you

1122
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,490
know what she said she said oh she's

1123
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:07,990
like she didn't say oh follow your

1124
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:10,320
dreams she was like you know there's a

1125
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:15,130
lot of starving actors in LA I was like

1126
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:17,380
okay I'll do the singing

1127
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:18,460
what you want you sang a lot I didn't

1128
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,750
want to be a singer though I just used

1129
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:29,170
to sing a lot and she's like you're not

1130
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:30,820
a singer to a certain degree and this is

1131
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:35,830
just being around singers like junior

1132
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:37,180
and David and you know it helps to be

1133
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:39,970
our own singers they teach I mean I'll

1134
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:42,040
never have a singer's voice but I can do

1135
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:44,770
enough to like I understand it more it's

1136
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:46,540
more of a science I mean not it's not a

1137
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:48,550
science but like there is some science

1138
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:50,020
yeah yeah that I didn't most people

1139
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:52,120
don't really know about but besides the

1140
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:54,700
point yeah I would say have a plan give

1141
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:57,160
them give them all I'm saying for my you

1142
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:59,920
can give your perspective but I think it

1143
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:01,690
helps for her too that the fact that she

1144
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,580
told me like okay this is what you're up

1145
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:05,140
against you might not if you make it

1146
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:06,610
great most people don't there's like a

1147
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:07,840
point something percent chance in the

1148
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:11,650
entertainment field at least for me

1149
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:13,720
going to be a actor or a entertainer or

1150
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:17,319
some sort it's very rare to really blow

1151
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:21,549
up right to know that

1152
00:48:17,319 --> 00:48:23,739
get that information from her it it

1153
00:48:21,549 --> 00:48:25,539
helped me because I'm like okay if I'm

1154
00:48:23,739 --> 00:48:28,539
gonna do this I gotta be like committed

1155
00:48:25,539 --> 00:48:30,400
to it and like I already know like if I

1156
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:32,589
don't want her to tell me oh I told you

1157
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:35,920
so you know so you got to commit to it

1158
00:48:32,589 --> 00:48:38,380
and I think knowing the if she's like I

1159
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,329
mean no offense to other people who are

1160
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:41,920
like this but if she would if she were

1161
00:48:40,329 --> 00:48:43,390
just like yeah you know what you could

1162
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,940
be an actor if you work hard and you

1163
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:48,519
just do it right like which is true but

1164
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:50,289
be I think it's just being realistic

1165
00:48:48,519 --> 00:48:51,279
like a lot of people work hard it

1166
00:48:50,289 --> 00:48:53,709
doesn't mean you're gonna be successful

1167
00:48:51,279 --> 00:48:54,789
in entertainment you might even be good

1168
00:48:53,709 --> 00:48:56,109
at it but it doesn't mean you're gonna

1169
00:48:54,789 --> 00:48:57,549
make money yeah you know so if you're

1170
00:48:56,109 --> 00:48:58,900
willing to live poor or if you're

1171
00:48:57,549 --> 00:49:00,400
willing to live all these like mega

1172
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:03,549
negative things that come with it then

1173
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:06,609
yeah by all means but if not you could

1174
00:49:03,549 --> 00:49:09,099
just don't don't go in thinking you know

1175
00:49:06,609 --> 00:49:10,989
be yeah be realistic that's all I would

1176
00:49:09,099 --> 00:49:14,289
say and you know a lot of times I think

1177
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:16,209
it's like opportunity but opportunity

1178
00:49:14,289 --> 00:49:19,839
zone you're like it's timing and it's

1179
00:49:16,209 --> 00:49:21,609
like being ready right and so I mean I

1180
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:24,190
related back to Ryan it's kind of like

1181
00:49:21,609 --> 00:49:27,309
you know he was like doing YouTube and

1182
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:30,369
then opportunity came to make money and

1183
00:49:27,309 --> 00:49:32,499
so he was like fortunate you know what I

1184
00:49:30,369 --> 00:49:36,160
mean so there's that one quote that's

1185
00:49:32,499 --> 00:49:38,380
like luck equals like preparation plus

1186
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:41,890
opportunity right for sure you know so

1187
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:43,660
it's all timing so I remember a father I

1188
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:46,319
was like oh what's your son studying you

1189
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:50,079
know he's in college and he said oh I

1190
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:52,180
forget he was studying like music you

1191
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,349
know and he was like yeah you know he's

1192
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:55,509
studying music I don't know where that's

1193
00:49:53,349 --> 00:49:58,109
gonna take him and he's in California

1194
00:49:55,509 --> 00:50:01,479
and I was like you know you never know

1195
00:49:58,109 --> 00:50:03,279
it's like if that's what he loves I mean

1196
00:50:01,479 --> 00:50:05,289
who knows right if he has that

1197
00:50:03,279 --> 00:50:07,509
opportunity and he's ready

1198
00:50:05,289 --> 00:50:09,519
I mean doors might just open you just

1199
00:50:07,509 --> 00:50:12,400
never know so you just gotta encourage

1200
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:14,589
them to be successful in whatever

1201
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,420
whichever way they go of course you want

1202
00:50:14,589 --> 00:50:17,979
them to be a little focused you know you

1203
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:20,709
want to jump from like okay singing

1204
00:50:17,979 --> 00:50:22,329
acting okay you know what I mean so at

1205
00:50:20,709 --> 00:50:25,449
least you want them to be a little

1206
00:50:22,329 --> 00:50:28,180
focused and then so that guy is

1207
00:50:25,449 --> 00:50:29,810
definitely selling knives right I mean

1208
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:33,500
you never know

1209
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:38,320
so well I haven't talked to the father

1210
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:38,320
but I remember his name is Bruno

1211
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:41,870
definitely silly

1212
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:44,540
Bruno actually aside from when he was

1213
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:47,000
young yeah he was like ready you know

1214
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:49,730
and then opportunity it sounds like the

1215
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,280
opposite of inspiring like podcasts but

1216
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:53,990
it's you know you need a sense of really

1217
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:56,660
like I mean I'm we're not saying hey

1218
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:58,790
there's no chance the odds might be slim

1219
00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:00,230
but like again you work hard enough even

1220
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:02,870
sometimes people who work their ass off

1221
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:04,310
right it pays off in different ways it

1222
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:06,020
doesn't always mean it's gonna be the

1223
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:07,460
end result you expect like you if you

1224
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:09,830
work your ass off it's gonna pay off in

1225
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:11,600
some way it might just not be the exact

1226
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:13,190
way you think it is because if just

1227
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,660
statistically it's not realistic

1228
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:17,150
no but if everybody that worked hard

1229
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:18,440
made it in that industry then nobody

1230
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:20,900
would have made it because it's all the

1231
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:23,300
same everybody's you know yeah yeah

1232
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:25,670
because like if I'm completely honest I

1233
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:29,230
didn't work hard most of my life and

1234
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:32,510
I've found myself in a very fortunate

1235
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:34,400
situation and I'm like along with you

1236
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:36,560
guys and stuff and I forced you to work

1237
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:40,700
hard yeah forced me to work hard now

1238
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:42,920
yeah but you know you're ready right I

1239
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:44,690
mean like you you have like skills and

1240
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:47,060
then they would then there was this

1241
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:49,520
opportunity a little bit but if you

1242
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:51,320
didn't have like that experience you

1243
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,270
wouldn't be here yeah that's true too

1244
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:54,890
cuz you did do things before that I hate

1245
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:56,360
that even for me to like a look at it

1246
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:58,100
and be like okay yeah he understands

1247
00:51:56,360 --> 00:52:00,800
like you've had you not made any videos

1248
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:02,120
and just came like and asked to be a

1249
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,500
part of this I would be like who the

1250
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:06,110
hell is this guy yeah you know so there

1251
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:08,270
is something there and even with your

1252
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:09,770
personality and stuff like that's you

1253
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:11,300
that comes with you'd like doing some

1254
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:12,950
hosting things that you weren't always a

1255
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:15,320
great speaker I don't think without

1256
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:18,740
having to build that up it's a skill now

1257
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:20,740
I was always a great speaker like my

1258
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:24,970
first word was actually a paragraph by

1259
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:28,550
William Shakespeare but in all religion

1260
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:30,830
as a kid I was a I did theatre and stuff

1261
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:33,110
really yeah that's right like you put in

1262
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:36,020
some work right yeah I'm sure that

1263
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:40,010
helped you did a lot did a lot I never

1264
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:43,400
did theatre I hated I actually don't

1265
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:44,630
like public speaking at all I hate

1266
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:48,289
speaking in front of people you just

1267
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:51,380
hate the public that's not wrong that's

1268
00:52:48,289 --> 00:52:58,940
not I don't like being in public likes

1269
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:59,750
being in private yeah I mean I like that

1270
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:01,520
segment because that's actually

1271
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:03,740
something that you know a lot of people

1272
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:05,930
are curious about and I think a lot of

1273
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:07,279
listeners especially younger or people

1274
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:08,779
who are trying to find themselves and

1275
00:53:07,279 --> 00:53:11,270
don't really know how to appease their

1276
00:53:08,779 --> 00:53:13,520
parents you know it'll help them I think

1277
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:15,079
well you know parents worry right of

1278
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,549
course because they want the best yeah

1279
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:19,220
they weren't the best they want them to

1280
00:53:16,549 --> 00:53:21,859
be successful they want them to be able

1281
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:23,750
to earn enough money to make a living

1282
00:53:21,859 --> 00:53:28,849
you know what I mean so parents have a

1283
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:30,020
lot of fear for their kids but something

1284
00:53:28,849 --> 00:53:33,559
you just have to look like if they have

1285
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:35,420
the talent or the passion you know you

1286
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:36,829
never know I mean who knows right like

1287
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:38,539
we didn't know Ryan was gonna be this

1288
00:53:36,829 --> 00:53:40,910
far I mean we didn't plan for this

1289
00:53:38,539 --> 00:53:42,200
not at all I think I'm just I think a

1290
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:45,109
lot of people need to understand you

1291
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:46,640
from the parents perspective is their

1292
00:53:45,109 --> 00:53:49,220
kids are considered like an investment

1293
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:51,740
is that because you know I put so much

1294
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:53,630
money into this bird into my offspring

1295
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:55,250
this person I care about that I want

1296
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:57,680
them to succeed in the way that I see

1297
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:59,359
because maybe they don't have the

1298
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,740
perspective or the openness to

1299
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:02,480
understand that they're oh there's

1300
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:04,130
different ways that you can make money

1301
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,589
especially with the internet nowadays

1302
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:08,539
and so if you were to explain that and

1303
00:54:06,589 --> 00:54:10,700
like you said like have a plan show them

1304
00:54:08,539 --> 00:54:12,260
how you can do it how you can actually

1305
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:14,960
have a revenue and be a financially

1306
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:18,440
stable and like what your 3 5-year plan

1307
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:20,990
is yep it helps oh yeah so that's still

1308
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:23,960
the guidance part yeah you know what I

1309
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:25,609
mean yeah and I still think a lot of

1310
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,859
people once they see a lot of people

1311
00:54:25,609 --> 00:54:29,210
don't realize they don't see the work

1312
00:54:27,859 --> 00:54:30,109
that goes in like you look at basketball

1313
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:31,460
players and say I want to be a

1314
00:54:30,109 --> 00:54:35,720
basketball player they get millions of

1315
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:37,190
dollars they you know live have like the

1316
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:39,260
nicest clothes nicest cars everything

1317
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:41,450
they see all the things you know that

1318
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:43,279
basically they see the rewards and they

1319
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:44,720
think that you know they know it's hard

1320
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:47,480
work they might be good at basketball

1321
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:48,470
but you don't really see you know if you

1322
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:50,720
really should have map out what your

1323
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:52,760
plan is then you kind of it becomes more

1324
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,950
real let me do it from a from a youtuber

1325
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:56,900
perspective a lot of people what they

1326
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:57,290
what they tell me especially like kids

1327
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,270
that

1328
00:54:57,290 --> 00:55:00,740
I've encouraged like oh yeah do what you

1329
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:02,990
love do if you want make youtube videos

1330
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:05,360
make them a lot of them will make I

1331
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:07,310
would say videos for about a month maybe

1332
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:09,830
two months and they realize holy crap

1333
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:11,690
this isn't easy like along with other

1334
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:13,460
stuff I have going on in my life like I

1335
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:15,710
just don't have time but that's like if

1336
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:17,150
you want to be committed youtuber you

1337
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:20,120
got to dedicate your life to it at this

1338
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:22,670
point you know and people don't don't

1339
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:23,780
realize that so when you say like put

1340
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:25,580
together a plan like how are you gonna

1341
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:27,590
be successful you got to do your

1342
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:29,810
research like ask a youtuber what do you

1343
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:31,310
do every day like a the one that you

1344
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:33,230
want to be like and most of them will

1345
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:35,330
tell you like oh they're either filming

1346
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:36,830
everyday editing or they had to build up

1347
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:38,660
like how did you get to where you were

1348
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:40,490
it's never the story that people think

1349
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:42,440
it is it's a lot more work than people

1350
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:43,970
think it is and until you try it for

1351
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:47,000
yourself that's when they realize like

1352
00:55:43,970 --> 00:55:48,950
okay this is not what I want to do or

1353
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,330
this is too much and I think those

1354
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:53,570
people are the people that actually like

1355
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:56,360
respect they find a newfound respect for

1356
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:58,550
people who are doing it yeah even if you

1357
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:59,840
don't like what they're creating you can

1358
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:02,180
still be like you know they're working

1359
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:04,910
hard yeah it's a lot of work I mean like

1360
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:07,190
I when I mean like when people first

1361
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:09,230
started doing daily videos I mean there

1362
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:11,260
was one guy even when I started we did

1363
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:14,210
daily videos and I was like this isn't

1364
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:15,920
not content like this is just I mean at

1365
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:18,200
the time it was new it was like I don't

1366
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:20,450
want to see you walk to the mall like I

1367
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:21,560
don't care obviously there was an

1368
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:23,150
audience for that and there still is

1369
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:26,420
more now than ever

1370
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:28,730
but you don't realize even for me as a

1371
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:31,130
youtuber was like oh yeah I could do

1372
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:33,560
that every day until you do it and you

1373
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:35,000
realize holy crap no you can't even take

1374
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:37,640
a day if you're a daily vlogger you

1375
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,430
can't take a day off even even like you

1376
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:42,620
know I don't know how often pewdiepie

1377
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:44,570
posts pretty much every day I know he

1378
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:47,270
shoots a lot in one at all at once so it

1379
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:48,680
kind of spreads it out but just the fact

1380
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:50,990
and now he has a lot of help but in the

1381
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:52,550
beginning he didn't have the team that

1382
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:54,230
he had you know he had to work on that

1383
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:55,790
and put in all that time and effort and

1384
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:58,520
you don't you don't really see it

1385
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:59,960
because you don't see all you don't see

1386
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,580
that side yeah people think are videos

1387
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:03,500
but if they're five minutes long took 10

1388
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:05,000
minutes to make you know you don't

1389
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,650
realize how long it takes to film and

1390
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,310
edit and write and everything that goes

1391
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:10,820
into it but I mean smart people know but

1392
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:13,010
a

1393
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:15,440
you do it it's really hard to just say I

1394
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:19,190
think you know if I as a parent if I saw

1395
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:21,470
like a child like you know your child

1396
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:24,230
working so hard and just like improving

1397
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:25,940
and I mean I mean that comes with talent

1398
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:27,170
too right so then you recognize that and

1399
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:29,480
of course you want to support it you

1400
00:57:27,170 --> 00:57:30,890
know so I think that's what you got to

1401
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:33,530
do if that's what you want to do like

1402
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:36,140
prove it then exactly prove it yeah less

1403
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:39,170
about talking yeah and it's not as easy

1404
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:40,670
as you think and so naturally your

1405
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:42,860
parents are not just gonna jump on it

1406
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:45,650
because you you that's what you wanna do

1407
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:48,070
because it looks nice or you know looks

1408
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:52,280
