such an image of our topic how to hide

8
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,059
your fart well let's just be real for a

9
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,350
second this is a real issue that we've

10
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:17,640
all had to deal with before and if

11
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,020
you've never had to deal with hiding

12
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,550
your forest before you either never

13
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,680
leave the house or you've never had a

14
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,050
bad meal in your life or you just have

15
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,029
really strong Buttle muscles but almost

16
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,500
flat whole muscles but a lotta muscles

17
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:29,849
lot of muscles I'm not gonna act like

18
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,710
I'm the most mature person in the world

19
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:33,059
it's clearly I'm not if I were mature I

20
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,829
probably wouldn't have repeated the

21
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,570
phrase butter muscles like 20 times

22
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,399
off-camera just cuz it sounded funny lot

23
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,540
of muscles that's like a new word butter

24
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,920
muscles it's not even butter whole

25
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,149
months it's just bottle muscles so

26
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,350
nobody else would get that but you guys

27
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:44,640
won't know what I'm talking about bottle

28
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,890
muscles I actually think it's even more

29
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,450
immature that people judge other people

30
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,770
as being immature just we're doing

31
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,390
something that's completely natural

32
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,920
that's like being judged for sneezing

33
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,449
can't control if a sneeze comes or goes

34
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,280
it just happened and that should be the

35
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:57,570
same per part farts are basically butt

36
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:03,780
sneezes and they shouldn't be looked

37
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:06,619
down on they should be blessed bless you

38
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,619
thanks Oh

39
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,920
unfortunately this is just not the world

40
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,240
we live in today we live in a place

41
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,950
where farts are considered rude

42
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,540
inappropriate immature well I've

43
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,490
compiled tips and techniques for all of

44
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,170
you to help survive this cruel fart

45
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,880
hating world that will keep fighting for

46
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,320
the freedom of farts but until that day

47
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,909
comes yours how to hide your fart

48
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,490
dedicated to all you people out there

49
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:28,200
with weak buttom muscles it's it's a

50
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:34,229
good word okay I'm a little immature

51
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:36,150
fine so in order to hide a fart you must

52
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:37,200
first understand the signs of a forge

53
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,180
when you make a fart sound with your

54
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,470
mouth it's created because your lips are

55
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,640
pressed together and air is trying to

56
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,899
escape your mouth it goes the same for

57
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,610
your butt but if you were to open your

58
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,259
lips and do the same thing there's

59
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,369
almost no sound at all same thing

60
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,899
applies to your butt that's why this

61
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:50,340
first one is called the cheek spreader

62
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:51,720
this technique is perfect for when

63
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,890
you're in class or any place that you're

64
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,090
sitting down all you have to do while

65
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,829
you're sitting down is put all your

66
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,240
weight on one butt cheek slide to the

67
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:59,670
other side to create that opening and

68
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,259
before you know it silent farts the

69
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,640
gentleman now one of the most terrible

70
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:04,259
times to be gassy is when you're on a

71
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,909
date not that I go on a lot of dates I

72
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,590
it's actually been a really long time

73
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:09,060
probably because I make videos about

74
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,410
farts anyway the gentleman is the

75
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,879
perfect technique for when you're on a

76
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,970
date all you have to do is open the door

77
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,410
letter and close

78
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:35,200
and as you're walking to your side of

79
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:37,240
the car yes I was I was saying about my

80
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,710
mom a cheap sink so we all know what a

81
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,270
lip-synced it's when somebody sinks up

82
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,320
their lips to a song to pretend like

83
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,060
they're singing but in this scenario

84
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,230
instead of lips you have cheeks if

85
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,520
you're in a scenario where you have to

86
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,020
relieve some gas just listen for

87
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,280
something around that you can cheek sink

88
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,690
too sometimes there might not be that

89
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,770
many sounds but you just have to listen

90
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,030
carefully for example if you're in

91
00:02:50,770 --> 00:03:03,940
elevators think of your farts to the

92
00:02:52,030 --> 00:03:04,840
beat they're raising the volume so I

93
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,040
don't know if you guys remember but I

94
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,660
had a technique like this a long time

95
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,040
ago in a previous video and basically

96
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,870
this strategy is if there's no other

97
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,980
sounds around you to cheek sing to take

98
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:27,459
matters into your own hands and just

99
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:29,709
make something louder than your fart the

100
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:30,250
other night I went on the worst date

101
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,170
ever

102
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:35,640
hey did I ever tell you guys that I have

103
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,640
a really good impression of a racecar

104
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:47,450
I mean that was okay racecar the vacuum

105
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:57,410
name says it all just suck it up see you

106
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:59,690
later man and what's that man I forgot

107
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:00,980
my are you all right blue the delay

108
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,390
this one's common sense when the herds

109
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,700
ready to move you just delete a little

110
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:15,890
bit we should probably uh yeah pretty

the Airbender and last but not least the

123
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:08,300
oldest trick in the book the blame this

124
00:05:06,769 --> 00:05:09,979
is for when all the previous methods

125
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:15,860
mentioned above fails all you have to do

126
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:19,729
blame it on someone else did you just

too it who was that who did that there's

129
00:05:22,219 --> 00:05:27,110
no one else around but us you know it

130
00:05:25,429 --> 00:05:29,869
probably just came from the TV or

131
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:32,179
something I mean I thought when we sat

132
00:05:29,869 --> 00:05:33,979
down I felt the couch move when I sat

133
00:05:32,179 --> 00:05:35,749
down like the leg of the chair and the

134
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:37,999
floor must have created like a vibration

135
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:41,059
they made a weird sound or couches

136
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:43,759
bolted to the floor that's weird

137
00:05:41,059 --> 00:05:46,189
that your family would vote then you
