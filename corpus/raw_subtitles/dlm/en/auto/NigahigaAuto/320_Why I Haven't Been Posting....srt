1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,390
let's see focused I am so I forgot what

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,580
this was light I'm filming by myself

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,170
today it's been like years since I've

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,269
done that in fact I am gonna be editing

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,769
this all by myself which I haven't done

6
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:15,990
in a long time but then I realize I got

7
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:17,640
a new computer and I don't have premiere

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:27,449
so I'm gonna be using iMovie remember

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:29,939
this stuff stuff we used to do old

10
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:32,099
school YouTube hmm hey guys so just like

11
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,079
the title says and I'm sure many of you

12
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:35,489
have already noticed I have been taking

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,630
a little bit of a break from YouTube and

14
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:39,180
I know that sounds a little bit

15
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,460
misleading because I have been posting

16
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,410
every week but just the podcast and I

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,629
have been posting twice a week on higatv

18
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,620
but when I say take a break I mean you

19
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:48,600
guys know if you've been on this channel

20
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,940
long enough this is not my normal type

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,140
of type of content and I know I probably

22
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,030
should have made this video before I

23
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,399
took this little break because that is

24
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,199
what normal youtubers do instead of just

25
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,760
you know upsetting their subscribers and

26
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,410
making them comment like where are you

27
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,470
haven't you been posting but do you know

28
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:06,840
me I like to go against the grain and by

29
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,850
that I mean go against what you should

30
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,610
do in order to maintain your YouTube

31
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,409
channel but that's okay because there's

32
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,140
still quite a handful of you that are

33
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,659
still here and I'm I actually very much

34
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,939
so appreciate that very much so a pre I

35
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,520
actually very I actually I appreciate

36
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:26,070
you guys and that's why I felt the need

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,509
to kind of explain myself in this video

38
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,850
for those of you that don't know I had

39
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:33,030
been making videos for a long time on

40
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,860
YouTube since 2006 about 13 years you

41
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,600
know I started in a time where you could

42
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,040
not make money off of YouTube and the

43
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,470
videos I started off doing a really

44
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,390
crappy you know so for me the fun part

45
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,680
was always just trying to get better

46
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,409
than the last video and just keep

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,299
improving and draw more fans to you and

48
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,009
see what you can do to be better and

49
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,930
essentially just make better content

50
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,909
because the better your content was I

51
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,979
mean the more YouTube would promote it

52
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:59,280
and that kind of just fit with my motto

53
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,509
of always wanting to improve and make

54
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,399
something better than the last video

55
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,250
that was always my goal but in the past

56
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,840
five or six years YouTube changed that a

57
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,310
lot and maybe it was even earlier than

58
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,410
that YouTube's algorithm change and

59
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,950
basically it became about watch time so

60
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,330
you wanted to make longer videos

61
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,980
and you wanted people to be watching

62
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,379
them all the way through and for the

63
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,209
longest time I tried to fight that

64
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:21,250
system and I always believed that you

65
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:23,220
know you should focus on quality and not

66
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:25,930
quantity even though that the sacrifice

67
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:28,269
you know a whole month of not posting

68
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,160
videos which will take a hit on your bun

69
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:31,540
your buns there's no other way to

70
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,739
describe that just snorted a little bit

71
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,750
but no other way to describe it it would

72
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:36,280
take a hit on your income because you're

73
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,989
not posting obviously less people are

74
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,760
watching your other videos as well and

75
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:41,950
for me I was actually okay with that

76
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,660
because like I said it was never really

77
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,910
about the numbers and stuff I just the

78
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,500
thing I really cared about was putting

79
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:49,420
out good content and stuff that I was

80
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,560
excited and happy to make you know me

81
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,880
and the guys were working on it we were

82
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,739
happy about it we didn't necessarily

83
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,299
care as long as you know a decent amount

84
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:57,610
of use or I could still pay everyone it

85
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:59,530
worked but over time as I kept trying to

86
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,540
do that the videos got crazier that

87
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,620
times it took to make it got longer I

88
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,390
don't know I don't even know when

89
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,430
exactly it started to happen but I was

90
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,260
subconsciously I think getting a little

91
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,690
frustrated with YouTube and getting

92
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,730
getting really just bitter I guess with

93
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,470
how what what YouTube had become seeing

94
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,709
the kind of content that was suddenly at

95
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:19,540
the top of the food chain that I mean I

96
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:20,889
have nothing against you know when all

97
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,329
the dish traps and stuff was happening I

98
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:23,980
actually it was one of the people who

99
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:26,230
said I don't blame them at all they're

100
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,579
actually doing what's what's what you

101
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,739
should be doing for your career that's

102
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:31,720
smart if I was a smart businessperson I

103
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:35,769
probably would have followed that trend

104
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:37,209
I am NOT I go against the grain but

105
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:39,609
anyway I'm getting a little off track

106
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:41,590
essentially to make this long story a

107
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:42,880
little bit shorter I was getting

108
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,190
frustrated with the way YouTube had

109
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,049
become and I guess I don't know when it

110
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,180
started to happen but I started to I had

111
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:51,100
a I got a very bad attitude having the

112
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,810
hollows to describe it it happened very

113
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,160
slowly like over time like I don't know

114
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,420
if you guys know this or not but over

115
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,739
the past few years I'm not gonna say

116
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,060
every single video but there's a lot of

117
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:00,519
videos in the past few years that I

118
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,560
posted that I knew for a fact could have

119
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:05,230
been better it wasn't ready to go out it

120
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,849
wasn't something I was proud of and I

121
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,919
was not happy about if I wasn't laughing

122
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:11,079
at it it wasn't good to me and I was not

123
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:12,370
laughing it I would see 90% of the

124
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:14,049
videos I posted in the last three years

125
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,400
and the finding is the ones I really

126
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:18,039
liked or the ones that didn't do well

127
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,440
the ones that I hated did super well

128
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:22,210
just because they were the right topic

129
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,590
or because they had the right like the

130
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:26,720
right title or the right thumbnail

131
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,190
we're soul encouraging they're like oh

132
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,169
my god right this is so brilliant this

133
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:32,300
is so smart I love this oh my god you're

134
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,620
the only genuine youtuber or whatever

135
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,240
it's not making funny I'm not making fun

136
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,470
of you guys I actually really appreciate

137
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,210
it all I'm saying is I'm trying to

138
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,979
explain that from my perspective I don't

139
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:42,320
know why but I would feel worse because

140
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:44,870
I knew that it wasn't I didn't deserve

141
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,220
it I don't know what see I have some

142
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,620
psychological issues I don't know what

143
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,199
that is and I know like I said it sounds

144
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,729
super first world problem problem me I

145
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,199
mean it is a first world problem but

146
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:55,699
it's a real it was a problem for me like

147
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:56,240
I said maybe you have mental issues I

148
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:58,010
don't know what it is

149
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,979
this is a hard video for me to post I

150
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:02,960
know it's not fun or funny it's not what

151
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:05,630
you're used to but it it's just more of

152
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,490
an update and I don't know why I vented

153
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:09,200
this to you guys but I felt like for the

154
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,330
few of you that cared this is the reason

155
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,590
why the content has changed but again as

156
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,120
much as I said I haven't think in a

157
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,740
break from YouTube there has been videos

158
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,150
that we've been working on if you do is

159
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,860
that I actually had fun doing here's a

160
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,180
little little preview of some of them

161
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:25,669
coming out I brought back a little bit

162
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:32,870
of cooking but not really oh oh oh do

163
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:34,430
you know no see kids you want to cut the

164
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,720
nipple off so they do the longer shows

165
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:44,120
they're hella fast ever watch those

166
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:46,099
videos you're like pretty good yeah I

167
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,630
did another ryan tries where i got to

168
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:49,729
paint some similarly kinda like a bob

169
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:52,430
ross type a video just because i always

170
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:56,060
wanted to paint just continue to paint

171
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:59,120
the entire canvas same color it already

172
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:01,700
is there's no mistakes here hopefully

173
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,979
gets a little bit lighter it's not

174
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,840
instruction across okay that's that's

175
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:08,000
not a happy cloud it's a little angry

176
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,700
might have gotten a little bit of black

177
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,650
on the brush another big whoops free

178
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,590
tree needs a friend there's no trees

179
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:17,630
that have no friends because they would

180
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:18,729
die you can't tell what one color starts

181
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:22,029
and where another one began

182
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:24,999

sorry I'm having fun making videos again

190
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,059
that's my main thing that's why I

191
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:42,039
haven't been posting videos because I'm

192
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:44,050
having fun making them that makes no

193
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:46,629
sense we actually have been working on a

194
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,289
crazy video it's about three months in

195
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:50,529

201
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:16,479
just made this video to update you guys

202
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:20,849
thank you to those of you that are still

203
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:23,709
here watching I have been very afraid to

204
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:25,599
release this video um I actually wanted

205
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:27,189
to release it when I was gonna take the

206
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,839
break which was three months ago just

207
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:30,610
kept pushing it back and in the process

208
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:32,979
I saw a lot of you got very frustrated

209
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:38,020
and upset so I want to apologize for

210
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:39,099
that but I yeah at the time I didn't

211
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,469
even know I was gonna take a break at

212
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:43,300
the time I was gonna either take a break

213
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:45,009
or quit but I think I finally realized

214
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,719
that now that I'm creating different

215
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:48,729
types of content that's not stuff that I

216
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:50,559
hate I don't need to quit I'm I feel

217
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:52,839
good I haven't felt this kind of freedom

218
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:54,219
on this channel since the very beginning

219
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,629
of YouTube I would have never posted

220
00:07:54,219 --> 00:07:56,919
this video of two years ago just me

221
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:58,629
talking that's not funny it's not

222
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:01,240
creative for those of you that are still

223
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:04,569
watching and are okay with that thank

224
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,740
you so much because it trust me it kind

225
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:07,930
of brought me out of a little mini

226
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,520
depression and I don't use that word

227
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,349
lightly and I know it seems like I'm

228
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,419
just complaining about like minuscule

229
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:14,860
things there's a lot bigger problems in

230
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:16,809
the world I know some people can't

231
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,129
afford to just because they hate their

232
00:08:16,809 --> 00:08:19,990
job they can't just quit their job and

233
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:21,879
do something else you know like I get it

234
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:23,490
but for anyone out there that is in a

235
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:26,289
scenario like this just know that

236
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:28,060
there's a way to get out and you just

237
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:30,069
have to wait for the opportunity and not

238
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,610
be afraid it's like jumping into a cold

239
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:35,120
pool you know it

240
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:37,940
day I need a better quote when trying to

241
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:41,450
say is don't let fear stop you from

242
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:43,159
jumping into the pool does that make

243
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:45,709
sense you know cuz the pool would be

244
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:47,959
like the new direction that the analogy

245
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:49,250
is like cuz you're hot right and you

246
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:51,079
know the pool is nice and cold but it's

247
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,269
scary to jump into it that transition

248
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:55,880
moment is the scary part so that's the

249
00:08:53,269 --> 00:09:00,589
fear that stops you let me rephrase

250
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:03,110
don't let fear I guess I guess the

251
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:05,029
difference in my scenario is some people

252
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,260
don't have the luxury of being able to

253
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:07,579
just jump into the pool because they

254
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:10,880
have other responsibilities maybe you

255
00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:13,730
have a kid don't let fear stop you from

256
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:17,180
jumping into the pool unless you have a

257
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:21,410
kid to take care of bring the kid in the

258
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:23,209
pool with you but he may drown you

259
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,440
because you have to swim for you can

260
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:25,670
jump into the pool if you have really

261
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,959
good legs straight also depends

262
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,839
Hollywood have to kick in the kids where

263
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,490
the kid can stay in the Sun suffering

264
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,890
push the kid into the shallow and don't

265
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:36,050
let fear of the kid drowning the kid is

266
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:38,839
on the shallow end of the fear and kids

267
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:43,250
or don't have fear of just orb don't

268
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:52,610
jump don't keep you don't have kids is

269
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:55,220
the lesson so what do you think yeah

270
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:57,459
think I'll keep editing the videos from

271
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,459
here
