Sparks is I mean romance and movies

20
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,059
always makes it seem so much better than

21
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,379
it really especially in movies like The

22
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,910
Notebook I'm gonna be reading these

23
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:43,260

hi okay so maybe I didn't watch to your

28
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:51,840
job but I'm assuming it's somewhat

29
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,559
similar this is how those movies were

30
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,559
look in the real world

31
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:09,979
and I know those are just move the

32
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,240
example but that's what a lot of people

33
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:12,530
think romance is really like like you

34
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,880
know move so if you're single and you're

35
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,229
sad about it I'm here to tell you that

36
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,700
you're not missing out on much because

60
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,060
prickly legs shave them

00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:14,700

69
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:23,940
no no how long should I wait to start

70
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:26,130
dating other people at least oh I love

71
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,009

72
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:34,080
other people

73
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:35,310
Taylor tea tea okay so that last one was

74
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,110
obviously a joke I would never say

75
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,580
teehee in real life that's so lame look

76
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,960
in all fairness to all those couples out

77
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,580
there this is coming from a single

78
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,960
person's perspective and in all honesty

79
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,340
I'm probably only saying these things

80
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,810
because I haven't met the right person

81
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,520
yet I truly believe that once you find

82
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,440
the one and you really do fall in love

83
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,300
every single expectation you ever had

84
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,979
will become a reality so to everyone out

85
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:57,409
there that is looking for real romance

86
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:57,409
don't give up just yet just give up
