1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:06,540
my name is Ryan Higa I've never believed

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,000
that these go stoves were real because

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,250
they all seemed so overly dramatic oh my

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,799
god I just got chills the a/c vent is

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,049
right there it is crazy how cold it is

6
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:19,980
right here and extremely easy to fake

7
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:22,199
hose that but then one night I had an

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,330
experience of my own that completely

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,000
changed my views on gosu ghosts are real

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,070
well they're not as they are what that

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,929
wasn't the experience I was referring to

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,700
because I don't have footage of it

13
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:35,219
however I can assure you that despite

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,960
all the jokes and obvious ghost show

15
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,890
parody everything you're about to see

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,140
and hear is 100% authentic even if we

17
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:49,200
end up capturing nothing at all this is

18
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:52,140
Brian tries ghost goes on him so right

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,270
now we are headed about 40 miles outside

20
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,510
of Las Vegas Nevada to the town of good

21
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,430
Springs to investigate the historic and

22
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,800
famously haunted building known as the

23
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,199
pioneers has been featured in multiple

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,390
movies and TV shows including Ghost

25
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:09,090
Adventures which were definitely not

26
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,950
coffee we're planning to stay throughout

27
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,900
the entire night to capture as much as

28
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,700
we can hopefully we actually get

29
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,710
something we have our normal filming

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,810
equipment normal audio recording devices

31
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,390
but in addition to that we picked up

32
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,400
some night vision cameras and some

33
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,799
actual ghost hunting equipment including

34
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,570
like those EVP recorders and clothes box

35
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,210
but two random stuff that we don't

36
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,770
actually know how to use but luckily for

37
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,170
us we are going to be meeting the owner

38
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,090
of the saloon who is

39
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:38,150
a lot more experience in this than we

40
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:40,549
are you a man

41
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:43,520
yeah meet you the legends here good to

42
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:45,020
see ya other legend a pair so um can you

43
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,180
just tell me like a history of this

44
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,789
place I sure bet so this is the town of

45
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:51,440
good Springs which back in the teens it

46
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:54,289
was one of the largest city in the

47
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,360
valley so good sprees got its big boom

48
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:58,340
of course because of the mining so I

49
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,899
mean I saw the episode that they did on

50
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,970
Ghost Adventures here and that was you

51
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:03,170
beyond the bar yeah right so I saw a

52
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:05,119
little bit of your story but just so

53
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:07,190
that we can have it tell us a little bit

54
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,600
of your experiences here my experience

55
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:11,900
it was about probably about nine years

56
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,880
ago I was getting ready to close up the

57
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,560
bar counted all the money made sure the

58
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,810
doors were locked but there's a full

59
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,720
apparition at the end of the bar that

60
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:24,110
drinks a beer maybe about that tall

61
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:25,790
beat-up cowboy hat just by looking at

62
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:29,299
you know he's you were looking directly

63
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:31,340
matically I didn't disappear or we had I

64
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:31,970
would say eye contact but that would be

65
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,860
impossible

66
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:37,280
you could tell by just looking at him

67
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:39,769
that he was there but not is there

68
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,980
anything correlated to the history

69
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:44,239
probably the best documented situation

70
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,100
at the bar there's three bullet holes

71
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,900
they could see daylight through all

72
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,329
three of them and that's from a card

73
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,519
game in 1915 where one of the players

74
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:54,380
was caught - you try to cash out ten

75
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:55,400
dollars and the dealer ended up shooting

76
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,519
him

77
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,790
Wilda justified homicide his punishment

78
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:05,060
was to bury him in the cemetery

79
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:06,349
interesting okay and obviously we're

80
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,489
gonna need some of your help with some

81
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:10,310
of the equipment that we're not used to

82
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:12,560
using I'm lending you guys the full

83
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,180
staff of the haunted lock down to her

84
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,980
and then they're gonna guide you guys

85
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:20,180
through it with all the spirit boxes all

86
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:21,470
that but you're out that's a good night

87
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,510
yeah all right all right

88
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:25,310
again well thank you again so I

89
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,620
appreciate know we appreciate it yeah

90
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:29,650
this is should be interesting

91
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,840
[Music]

92
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:36,950
all right so I'm here with Jill and

93
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,720
Daryl and you guys want to explain we

94
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,549
have a bunch of fun devices here but you

95
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,560
want to explain what you guys do exactly

96
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:45,170
yes actually we're members of the

97
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,069
Pioneer saloon Coast team yeah so

98
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,269
basically what we have here is a

99
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:49,879
collection of the devices that we use

100
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:52,220
for the lockdowns and Joe can explain a

101
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:54,290
little bit about them yes this right

102
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,840
here is one of my favorite devices it's

103
00:03:54,290 --> 00:04:00,220
a spirit box with this device we can

104
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:04,129
actually communicate with the spirits

105
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:06,620
through the white noise this is just a

106
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:08,720
radio receiver what we do is we scan it

107
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,489
in Reverse so this just cat scanning

108
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,590
different radio frequencies and so

109
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:14,000
sometimes we'll pick up words or in a

110
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:16,250
very rare occasions you'll pick up whole

111
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,440
sentences which is pretty cool because

112
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:22,280
you're it's like you have before in the

113
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:24,950
pen just to explain we're not in the

114
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,630
saloon right now this is the SI nexus

115
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,490
alone so there's not any technically

116
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,710
anything here right that we've gotten a

117
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,450
lot of activity here I think it's really

118
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,370
the whole property well you were also

119
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:37,520
telling us that electronics for whatever

120
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:39,530
reason here messed up like we've already

121
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,630
had one of our batteries a couple of

122
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:44,060
them actually just fully charged when we

123
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:47,419
came here just dead that's a that's sort

124
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,830
of typical but here the body a lot of

125
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:50,419
people a lot of guests have said that

126
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,770
like oh my phone died and this doesn't

127
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:54,940
that happened were like Mike that's not

128
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:58,580
surprising this is one of the original

129
00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:01,370
it's called a EMF detector what a lot of

130
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:03,530
people in the paranormal field use this

131
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,569
will you can measure when the lights go

132
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:07,240
up

133
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:09,429
okay that means someone a spirit is

134
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,979
close to this basically measuring energy

135
00:05:09,429 --> 00:05:13,659
so what energy becomes comes interactive

136
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:16,330
it's the same with with the RAM pod

137
00:05:13,659 --> 00:05:17,919
that's my energy interacting with it so

138
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:21,999
the so the closer something is exactly

139
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:26,860
this is the Ovilus five this actually

140
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:31,659
has noticed that was this this is

141
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:34,389
speaking now said raised and this will

142
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:36,459
actually it has a built in dictionary

143
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:38,770
and the spirits can actually pick the

144
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:40,689
words that they want to communicate with

145
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,759
us through this right so why did that

146
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:45,399
just happen now raised an end I'm not

147
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,319
real sure um is there ever a time where

148
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:49,119
you feel like it's just how do you know

149
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:51,279
it's really thank you can be it can it

150
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:53,379
can be random because it's affected also

151
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:55,119
by the environment but the goal for us

152
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:56,589
is like you know if you want to try to

153
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:58,300
get one of these to light off will say

154
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,860
are you here think you make the meter

155
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:03,009
light up and try to get a specific

156
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:05,139
reaction to a question now we do have a

157
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:07,959
lot of prominent spirits here one of

158
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:11,740
them I'd love to talk about on this side

159
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:15,099
actually because ultimately she was

160
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:17,709
murdered right over I'm like fried by

161
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:20,769
the second booth over Gerrard left her

162
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:23,199
name was Ruby Ruby was here in the store

163
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:26,229
the cafe it was a mercantile store back

164
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:29,379
then she was alone and someone came in

165
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:32,349
and they beat her they raped her and

166
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:35,759
then she was strangled and she was left

167
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:38,769
for dead right over children after all

168
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:45,009
right a man that seems like a good place

169
00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:47,139
is in the story right as we began to cut

170
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:49,619
cameras and move on to the next part of

171
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:52,269
our investigation one of the devices

172
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:54,639
unexpectedly began to go off on its own

173
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:57,790
I mean it's fine if you work now nobody

174
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:00,470
touched that as you guys just saw but

175
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:03,370
you got that cold there you go they're

176
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:06,380
doing it again yeah

177
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:08,780
can you make it go to red my gosh what

178
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,700
does that mean red only just ask them

179
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:15,610
okay I take it you guys are ready to

180
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:18,560
tell Ruby story that let's let's do

181
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:21,380
after reviewing this footage carefully

182
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,360
with headphones our audio devices also

183
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:26,710
capture what we thought sounded like a

184
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,710
scary ghost more

185
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:36,310
only to later discovered that it's

186
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:40,590
actually a familiar noise that our

187
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:40,590
cameraman Gregg makes when he scares

188
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:47,860
we're in the booth right now where ruby

189
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:49,060
was murdered well there wasn't a booth

190
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,249
it was she was on the ground yeah

191
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:53,020
correct right where we're setting her

192
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:56,979
head was a little bit past year is where

193
00:07:53,020 --> 00:08:02,469
she am okay so this is the first I guess

194
00:07:56,979 --> 00:08:04,810
spot right so about ten thirty one night

195
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:08,110
we drive house to Cemetery which all saw

196
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:10,930
and it's pitch-black we parked on the

197
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:13,479
outside and there's a fence there so the

198
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:15,580
woman said should we take photos I said

199
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:19,990
of course I always take three this is

200
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:23,469
what was in the second photo is that

201
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:26,560
amazing now until someone can tell me

202
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:27,849
differently because I know this girl and

203
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,419
I'm very unsound

204
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:45,640
but right you can't tell me that is no

205
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:53,589

206
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:56,529

friendly that's good to hear yes after

212
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:13,420
these two strange occurrences in the

213
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:15,819
cafe next to the saloon it was time to

214
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:18,100
investigate the saloon itself by sitting

215
00:09:15,819 --> 00:09:20,500
at the exact same table that the poker

216
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:24,880
player was murdered at back in nineteen

217
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:27,390
something a long time ago is there

218
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,620
anyone here with us right now

219
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,620

audio recorders closely can you guys say

222
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,450
hello to us how many spirits are here

223
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,450
with us

224
00:09:48,730 --> 00:10:00,730
Ruby are you here with us three and you

225
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,980
make his meter line up in front of him

226
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:07,930
thank you

227
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:07,930
okay how many ladies are here with us

228
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:12,130
that was a girls voice

229
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:21,940
really after closer review we noticed

230
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:24,400
that the flight pattern of those orbs

231
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,780
looks similar to that of a bug but since

232
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,450
we're not experienced enough to

233
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:31,000
distinguish between actual orbs and bugs

234
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:46,900
we can't debunk this one so for now

235
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:53,800
we'll just call it the bug is all here

236
00:10:46,900 --> 00:11:07,600
with us right now anything you want to

237
00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:09,670
say Paul hello we continue to try and

238
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,310
communicate with Paul for nearly 30

239
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:14,590
minutes but had little to no response

240
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:16,390
but because Paul died playing poker we

241
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,130
decided to bring out playing cards in

242
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:29,140
hopes to trigger a response from him

243
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:44,620
when this happened hey Paul Paul do you

244
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:46,750
think we should call yeah but that was

245
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,700
the only coherent response we got for

246
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,500
the next twenty minutes so we decided to

247
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,120
move on to the next spot that has been

248
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,340
frequently reported for having

249
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,950
paranormal activity but right now we're

250
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,540
gonna have its I don't know it just

251
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,700
keeps going red which supposedly there's

252
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:03,230
a lot of activity we're gonna head to

253
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,700
the bathroom because weird I'm not

254
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:07,070
sure what happened there but they said

255
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,630
that a lot of women say that a lot

256
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:10,730
happens in the women's bathroom

257
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:17,300
specifically the women's side I think we

258
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:20,530
should check that out all right so we're

259
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,530
going to the women's bathroom

260
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,509

261
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,630

like this so earlier I was going off

284
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:53,960
when it's on that's why I freaked us out

285
00:13:35,030 --> 00:14:22,070
hasn't really done since there's

286
00:13:53,960 --> 00:14:24,140
something there continue to investigate

287
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:26,150
the men's bathroom with the REM pod we

288
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:28,730
also got a coherent response for the

289
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:30,140
very first time from the Ovilus v the

290
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,970
device that allows spirits to

291
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:34,190
communicate using a select number of

292
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:41,360
words almost like a modern-day Ouija

293
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:43,130
board this may not seem like a big deal

294
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,650
but throughout the entire night the

295
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:47,630
Ovilus v had little to no activity and

296
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:50,120
even when it did it gave us words that

297
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:52,820
seemed completely irrelevant but when it

298
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,730
gave us the words look area and much the

299
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:59,030
exact same time that we were looking at

300
00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:01,820
an area very much Lee we couldn't

301
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:04,580
pretend that we weren't freaked out much

302
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:12,810
Lee freaked out

303
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:17,690
you this is your show are you still here

304
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:20,960
oh what's on the other side of this wall

305
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:25,620
the only thing that's actually out here

306
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:27,990
no it's yes at this exact moment outdoor

307
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,730
audio equipment could barely capture it

308
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,170
two of our cameramen heard a thump

309
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:39,810
coming from behind them on the other

310
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:52,380
side of the room what was that what you

311
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:54,620

00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:13,960
whether you're a believer or a skeptic

364
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:16,419

00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,309
we'll never know for sure your spirits

366
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:20,620
really trying to communicate with us or
