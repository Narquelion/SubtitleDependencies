1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,030
hey guys so I don't know if it's just me

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,740
but I feel like lately a lot of people

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,299
have been a lot ruder to other people

4
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,630
than they have been in the past ruder

5
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:10,950
ruder I'm rude but he's ruder ruder what

6
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,500
why does that sound so weird little

7
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,000
spellcheck ruder nope no squiggly red

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,199
line so it must be a real word don't act

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,520
like you guys don't do that but anyway

10
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,730
kind of notice that people in general

11
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,350
seem to be getting ruder more rude earth

12
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,090
I feel like growing up I didn't win this

13
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,650
nearly as many room people as I do now

14
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,300
then again I did grow up in Hawaii and

15
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,830
if you're rude there most the time you

16
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,570
just get beat up I mean I guess beating

17
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,130
up people is a little rude too but I'm

18
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,570
off top anyway I feel like the world is

19
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,190
becoming more and more hateful and

20
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,420
negative place lately for example I was

21
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,040
at the coffee shop the other day and I

22
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,540
witnessed a guy who slipped and kind of

23
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:47,610
spilled some coffee and another guy who

24
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:49,079
reacted pretty ruefully problem row yes

25
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,430
if someone spills anything on you it's

26
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,719
pretty upsetting but you don't have to

27
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,520
go and curse them on and then another

28
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,410
day I was at the gym it was actually a

29
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,989
while back because I was at the gym

30
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,520
clearly you know I don't even lift bro I

31
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:01,530
was walking by these two fairly

32
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,640
attractive girls and being the nosy

33
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,960
person that I am I was kind of

34
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,860
eavesdropping on their conversation

35
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,150
basically they were talking about

36
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:10,049
another girl that they were looking at

37
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:12,119
that was on a treadmill do you see what

38
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:18,479
she's wearing you do not come in do it

39
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:20,340
mmm she ever heard of shaving and then

40
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,900
most recently which pretty much inspired

41
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,310
me to make this video I had to go to a

42
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,990
place where there's nothing but built-up

43
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,759
anger frustration and just all-around

44
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,960
rudeness and hate throughout the entire

45
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:32,340
facility next I said next if you're a

46
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,900
driver you know exactly what I'm talking

47
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,369
about but you get the point I mean I get

48
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,299
it everyone has bad days including

49
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:37,890
myself I mean I'm not gonna lie

50
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,540
sometimes I do feel like pushing back

51
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,040
the guy who bumped into me on a crowded

52
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,360
street or yelling at a waitress who

53
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,740
brought me the wrong order after making

54
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,119
me wait an hour or even flipping off a

55
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,619
guy who cut me off in traffic but then I

56
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,329
think of a motto that I kind of made up

57
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,070
and it's helped me be a much more

58
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:51,600
friendly and positive person we all know

59
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,430
all the generic sayings we heard growing

60
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,049
up you nicer to others or tree people

61
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,670
you want to be treated those sayings are

62
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,049
so vague and overused at the moment

63
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,579
something bad happens or we're having a

64
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:01,200
bad day we just completely forget about

65
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:02,670
which is why I created a new campaign

66
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,110
that is even more straightforward and

67
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,860
hopefully a little less forgettable they

68
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,210
treat people like they're dying can be

69
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,830
no it might sound a little negative but

70
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,300
it's the complete opposite if everybody

71
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,710
treated each other as if they were dying

72
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,390
people would be friendlier and more

73
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,830
forgiving for example if he knew a guy

74
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,510
was dying and he accidentally spilled

75
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,980
coffee on you I guarantee that you would

76
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,510
not yell at him and you would not curse

77
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,280
him I seriously don't worry about it

78
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,660
it's just a shirt most people would not

79
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,100
yell at a guy who's sorry the world

80
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,690
would have less Mean Girls because no

81
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:29,110
one talks crap behind a dying person's

82
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:31,390
back she's so inspirational seriously

83
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:33,610
she's so brave in general people would

84
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,320
just be nicer to each other hi so sorry

85
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,790
to keep you waiting look I do for you

86
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,140
but not only will people be nicer to

87
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,430
each other when people realize that

88
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,050
they're dying a lot of times that's when

89
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,580
people live life to its fullest no

90
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,080
longer will people have to put up all

91
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,310
the things they wanted to do in life no

92
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,720
longer where people have to wait to

93
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,970
their father's deathbed to hear the

94
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,040
words I've always been my son no longer

95
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,330
when people wait to chase after the real

96
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,890
dreams some people may know their

97
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,420
expiration date and some don't but in

98
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,980
reality we're all dying right now

99
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,390
because none of us live forever every

100
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,830
second of every day we're one step

101
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,360
closer to death and I think it's about

102
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,470
time we started treating each other like

103
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,060
it so the next time someone does

104
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,070
something bad or upsetting to you and

105
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,360
you feel like responding negatively just

106
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,930
remember if you want to make this world

107
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,600
a better place

108
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,900
spread the positivity treat people like

109
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,900
their died

110
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:39,970
hell that was so bad that was so cheesy

111
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,020
this entire video is so dying

112
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:45,170

113
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:46,250
