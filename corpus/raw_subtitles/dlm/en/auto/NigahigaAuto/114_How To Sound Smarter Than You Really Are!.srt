1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:09,240
hey guys so I what does it look so

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:11,610
different in here huh anyway um hey guys

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,840
so over the 10 - almost 11 years that

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,580
I've been on YouTube I've gotten to do a

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,020
lot of things that I never thought I'd

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,279
be able to do before and I'm sure if you

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,270
ask any other youtubers that have been

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,380
around for that amount of time and

9
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,789
they'll agree with me when I say that

10
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,010
people start treating you like you're

11
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,750
some kind of genius professional social

12
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,250
media expert and I'm sure it is true for

13
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,019
a lot of those youtubers who actually do

14
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,789
consider themselves geniuses but for me

15
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,619
even after 10 years of doing this I

16
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:32,850
still don't think I know exactly what

17
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:33,809
I'm doing I'm borderline dumb when it

18
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,399
comes to this stuff I just make the

19
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:37,140
videos that I like making and luckily

20
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,300
people watch they don't have some genius

21
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,620
strategy or like expertise that I could

22
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,239
share with everyone which is why I bring

23
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,559
this up I get asked all the time to

24
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,420
attend these like huge business

25
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:47,610
conferences and meetings where people

26
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,320
pretty much just asked for my expertise

27
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,940
on social media and they treat me like

28
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,050
I'm one of the all-knowing of social

29
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,399
media and to be honest when I go to

30
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,870
these things I feel completely out of

31
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,879
place people that attend these things

32
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,649
are like millionaire billionaire and and

33
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,359
women that owned multiple businesses

34
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:02,430
they're all taking notes and advice from

35
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,229
this 26 year old college dropout with

36
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,750
stupid looking hair talk about YouTube

37
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:08,369
and and all the expertise and knowledge

38
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,080
that I have to share with them I mean I

39
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:12,540
don't like to brag but I think I pretty

40
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,720
much killed it so tell us Ryan how does

41
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,580
one get started on YouTube well you see

42
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,360
you have to make an account by clicking

43
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,250
the sign up button okay are there any

44
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,110
complications or problems that one might

45
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,640
run into when starting a channel and if

46
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,009
so how do you solve them I mean

47
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,619
sometimes your user name can already be

48
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,240
taken so you solve that by adding like a

49
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,189
number to it or you could you know

50
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,780
change the letters like can we go e into

51
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:38,850
it like a three like a backwards e

52
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:42,090
alright one last question how do you

53
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:44,340
come up with your ideas well ideas are

54
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,720
just thoughts and everyone has thoughts

55
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,790
I mean I have thoughts right now this

56
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,979
meeting could be a video idea you know

57
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,259
like I could make literally this meeting

58
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:54,299
a video well let's hope you don't do

59
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,070
that because this is a very confidential

60
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,229
meeting I mean it's already happening

61
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,969
what right in the video right now you

62
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:02,070
really can't do this too late this is

63
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:03,810
gonna be a video can and we will sue you

64
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,799
if you make a video blog this event okay

65
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:09,479
sure

66
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,610
oh yeah that's why I have no stuff I'm

67
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,170
just plain but in all seriousness having

68
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,819
to hang out with these uh maybe you will

69
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,230
call them

70
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:16,730
Jewett's I started noticing some

71
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,409
patterns between them not just the

72
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,510
successful ones but more so with the

73
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:21,920
unsuccessful ones that are appearing to

74
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,329
be successful and today I'm gonna be

75
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,690
teaching you just that how to sound

76
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:29,020
smarter than you really are

77
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:30,640
[Music]

78
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,200
one of the easiest ways to appear

79
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,430
smarter than you really are is to dress

80
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,780
the way they dress that you see if you

81
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,700
dress poorly you'll look stupid for

82
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,680
example if you dress like a hobo or like

83
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,270
a poor person you'll never get any

84
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,410
respect and people will never think

85
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,790
you're smart let me take a look at this

86
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:45,220
guy you think people actually think this

87
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,810
guy is smart and successful no or even

88
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,100
if you wear like a plain shirt like this

89
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,930
guy you think anybody's gonna think

90
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,920
you're smart dressed like that if you

91
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,850
want people to take you seriously if you

92
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,500
want people to think that you're smart

93
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,510
you have to dress smart Dress for

94
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:59,440
Success and only then people believe

95
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:00,460
that your genius like this pretty

96
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,930
self-explanatory

97
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,790
normal people like you and I have a

98
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,170
dictionary they have the thesaurus

99
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,940
some people just like to use words that

100
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,080
people don't use as often for example if

101
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,910
someone's giving you the choice to pick

102
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,740
between two options rather than just

103
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:13,660
saying which option you want you say

104
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,790
I'll take the ladder so which one would

105
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,160
you like a or b no I'll take the ladder

106
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,580
uh but which one would you like the

107
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,560
ladder

108
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,360
oh the latter okay so you want the

109
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,680
second one no the ladders oh you want

110
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,510
the first one just the ladders so you

111
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:31,030
want both of them oh my god I'm just

112
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:32,230
gonna get in myself in the ladders smart

113
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,430
people always want to know what you do

114
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,840
they always make their job sound way

115
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,400
more important than it really is

116
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,680
school janitor more like certified

117
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,090

oh except - the latter part of the

139
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,400

00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,250
you're gonna be the dumb one but what's

144
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,510
simple just hang out with people less

145
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,979
intelligent than you you think you're

146
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:36,330

00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:59,229
everything no matter how hard it is to

153
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:02,110
see for the rest of you dummies oh my

154
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:04,440
god it's so beautiful it's a masterpiece

155
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:07,330
how is this part of the art exhibit

156
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,940
don't you see this represents life life

157
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:12,220
itself look you start from nothing and

158
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,169
you slowly make your way to the top for

159
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:17,800
only a moment before falling all the way

160
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:19,750
back down to nothing excuse me what are

161
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,310
you doing wait are you guys looking for

162
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,310
the art exhibit that's across the street

163
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:29,110
I've come to find that this last one is

164
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,750
a hundred percent accurate all smart

165
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,650
people must talk about politics and if

166
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,810
you're anything like me you probably

167
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,430
know very little to nothing about

168
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,690
politics so if you ever happen to get

169
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,190
caught in a discussion with a smart

170
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:40,210
person talking about politics just agree

171
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,800
with them that way they'll just keep

172
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,240
talking again you won't have to what's

173
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,510
the deal with that it's pretty crazy

174
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,760
what you think right I'm sorry what you

175
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,289
know about Trump and the wall between us

176
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:54,250
and Mexico what do you think about it

177
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:56,889
well I mean like clearly where it's

178
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:58,840
talked about all over on the news and

179
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:01,360
where all three of us are talking about

180
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:04,240
it three guys at a table during the day

181
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,990
so obviously yeah like a hundred percent

182
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,810
agree yep but yeah Trump is doing a

183
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:13,360
great job a great job at being a

184
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,860
horrible for the economy just awful I

185
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,270
mean some people think he's actually

186
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:19,560
helped the economy since I became

187
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:22,660
president right he's been awfully great

188
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,030
he's a man that I just love but come on

189
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:27,940
as a president he's killing it right now

190
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:29,410
it's full successful men that I just

191
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,699
love love loving all of our

192
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:33,230
international time to make fun of

193
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:35,690
because he's just so bad

194
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:37,670
that's right it's a badass man that's

195
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:39,230
why I completely support that no

196
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:43,210
countries you know work with the other

197
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:45,350
guy that he was running against what I

198
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,550
support the guy he was running again

199
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,720
you're talking about Hillary Clinton

200
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,580
exactly right

201
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:55,010
Hillary Clinton Bill Clinton's mother

202
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:57,770
sis bills and you know but Obama though

203
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:59,480
right everybody loves him she's got my

204
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,670
boat locked in if you know what I mean

205
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,930
but you do know that he's not gonna be

206
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,850
in the next show in the next election

207
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,470
exactly what I was just about to say he

208
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,730
can't running he should not be running

209
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,200
he's getting old he should be walking

210
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,730
this is his final term he can't have a

211
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,170
third term exactly why he needs to ace

212
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,970
it I mean he you know the final is

213
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:16,220
always worth more than the mid term yeah

214
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:41,480
I can't really tell if you're joking or

215
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:45,350
if you're just stupid I really just pull

216
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:48,890
that off oh my god do you think he knew

217
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:50,450
that was a letter mean I don't know but

218
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:52,190
again with all jokes aside it doesn't

219
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:53,810
matter if you talk about politics a lot

220
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,250
or if you use big words like the ladder

221
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,630
everybody's different who's to say

222
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,950
what's considered smart and what isn't

223
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:59,360
