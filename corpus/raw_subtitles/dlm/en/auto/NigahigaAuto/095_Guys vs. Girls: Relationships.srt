think well the WNBA yeah but you

14
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,899
actually think that relationships would

15
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,050
be better if girls were more like guys

16
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,460
yeah you're completely wrong well then I

17
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,980

18
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,230
all war that has been going on for ages

19
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,210
a war so brutal that even the gods

20
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:55,010
themselves have just get to it

21
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,010
guys versus girls

22
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:05,820
you shall not pass

00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:08,800
[Music]

24
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,600
okay first off guys are shallow oh right

25
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,370
this again all guys care about is boobs

26
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,230
ass and tits boobs and tits are the same

27
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,830
thing but now hotter girl looks you know

28
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:19,150
there's way more to us than our exterior

29
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,590
yeah I admit guys can be a little

30
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,820
shallow sometime told ya but don't

31
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,240
pretend like girls aren't just as

32
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,550
shallow

33
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,080
oh please there's no way okay then tell

34
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,760
me white girls go crazy over guys with

35
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,080
nice bodies you don't do that can you

36
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,670
really look me in the eye and tell me

37
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,140
that the reason why so many girls love

38
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,510
Taylor Lautner is because of his acting

39
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:39,580
uh yeah the reason why so many girls

40
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:41,650
love Taylor Lautner okay fine so we like

41
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,880
hot bodies big deal but looks aren't as

42
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,650
big a big deal to girls as they are to

43
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,119
guys yeah but you girls are the reason

44
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,500
for that how was this our fault you

45
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:48,670
pretend like you guys don't care about

46
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,930
looks yet what do you do every single

47
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,280
morning you put on makeup sometimes

48
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,840
throughout the entire day you get your

49
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,190
hair done or did is some might say and

50
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,869
you care about it so much and you don't

51
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,229
even let us guys crack a window in the

52
00:01:55,869 --> 00:01:58,060
car

53
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:59,740
not to mention shopping what about it

54
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,210
girls love to go shopping because

55
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,470
they're into buying materialistic things

56
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,690
that make them look good whether it's a

57
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:09,610
dress or shoes or nail pain it's polish

58
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:10,810
that - oh yeah and don't girl see that

59
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,580
the one thing a guy should never do is

60
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,140
call the girl fat obviously but you can

61
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,580
call guys fat and they usually don't

62
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,900
care but if you call a girl fat they get

63
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,459
extremely hurt you know why because

64
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,170
girls care that much more about their

65
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:21,750
physical appearance therefore proving

66
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:28,619
that girls are more shallow than guys

67
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:28,619
[Music]

68
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,940
all right here's one go for it in a

69
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,890
relationship the girl usually cares way

70
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,450
more than the guy since when okay well

71
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:49,320
let's start small remember when I got my

72
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:56,370
haircut earlier this week what why are

73
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:58,350
you moving oh here sit here fix it with

74
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,720
a comb not your hands and what does your

75
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:03,540
hair look so weird today anyway well at

76
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,080
least I noticed it was different right

77
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,670
[Music]

78
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,470
[Applause]

79
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:12,330
and you know it was one example and like

80
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,800
I said shallow mad because I didn't

81
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,180
notice your haircut it's not about the

82
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,680
haircuts the fact that you didn't care

83
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,320
enough to notice a difference just like

84
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,810
that one time you came over

85
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:25,860
hey what up G my dog just died it was a

86
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:28,710
hit and run oh so sorry

87
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:33,630
see I was thoughtful I cared just to

88
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:35,540
finish the flashback hey yeah do you

89
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:39,030
have any more hot pockets in the freezer

90
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:42,150
no yeah you're right that so insensitive

91
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,770
I should just go check myself mighty

92
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:47,490
fans you didn't have any left so it was

93
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:48,390
kinda even you just stopped using those

94
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,060
examples we're talking about

95
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:52,710
relationships not us ah okay fine well

96
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,090
when it comes to relationships break up

97
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:56,820
show a lot about how much people care

98
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,440
it's true and once again girls care more

99
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,150
that is press pause Buress you mean

100
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,330
preposterous you know what I meant

101
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:05,610
oh yeah look there's no easy way to say

102
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:09,060
this but I don't think it's working out

103
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:12,320
huh what a huge relief alright then just

104
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,320

106
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,970
you can't use that that never happened

107
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,630
it's just an example it happens to girls

108
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,310
all the time

109
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,840
text breakup I've never even heard of

110
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,400
that this one's made up well let's just

111
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,690
see you takes a break-up harder the guy

112
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:32,570

113
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:35,540
need to call her back I'll have all my

114
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:37,190
hot pockets there and after some time

115
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:44,900
passes let's see who really cared about

116
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:46,220
the relationship hello

117
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,350

00:04:54,430 --> 00:05:08,960
so bar that sounds good look maybe I

121
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,760
didn't notice a haircut or two and maybe

122
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,080
I wasn't as caring as I should have been

123
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,700
when I accidentally ran over your dog

124
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,320
wait wait but it's only because we get

125
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,850
along so well you like a homie I've just

126
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,610
always treated you like one of the guys

127
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:20,300

128
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,490
girl too

129
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,990
gee thanks look I get it guys have been

130
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,310
asking to you in the past but think of

131
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,830
all the guys who choose to date you know

132
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:30,200
not all guys are like that and

133
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:32,000
hypothetically speaking if we were to

134
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,450
ever for whatever reason be in a real

135
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,340
relationship together I wouldn't I could

136
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:39,979
never do something like that to someone

137
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:42,289
I care about so much because that would

138
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:43,760
just be prosperous look gee I know

139
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:45,349
you've been looking everywhere and I

140
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,880
don't understand why you can't seem to

141
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:50,620
find a guy they can see how amazingly

142
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,030
rare you are but maybe

143
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:55,170

144
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:58,830
