1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,870
hey guys so I know I don't ever say this

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:05,640
cuz I don't like to brag or anything but

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,390
I'm probably the most romantic person

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,980
I've ever met

5
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,090
in the entire world ever if anything I

6
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,380
always say in my videos that I'm

7
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,480
actually the opposite that I'm not

8
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,730
romantic but I really am I'm a womanizer

9
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,890
which means I'm a I'm a Britney Spears

10
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,650
song apparently that's crazy

11
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,460
oops did it again as I was saying a very

12
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,020
romantic person

13
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,769
I literally do all the things that grows

14
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,060
want for example I open doors oh you

15
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:27,689

16
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:35,370
gentleman

and are there curtain fire but I

20
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:44,570
remember this time I remembered I got

21
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:44,570
your real ones as well Oh

22
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:52,280
see how they're like realistic I pulled

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,280
her chair oh thank you

24
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,270
how was he and I know nobody even does

25
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,289
this anymore but I'm such an old-school

26
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,879
romantic that I even take her jacket oh

27
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:04,909
that is cold here let me get this Oh

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:09,510
actually I'm kind of cool no it's okay

29
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:11,549
okay that's way better should I get your

30
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,860
jacket since you took mine no I'm good

31
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,080
moms go should you see shivering is not

32
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,460
dead or something like that anyway isn't

33
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,259
already incredibly obvious that I am

34
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,490
clearly joking I'm horrible when it

35
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:22,259
comes to romance and I honestly believe

36
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,640
it's because of romantic movies they set

37
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,840
the bar too high for the rest of us

38
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,950
Holly what does the same thing every

39
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,810
year they take this best-selling

40
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,220
romantic novel turn it into a movie all

41
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,509
the girls in real life go and see this

42
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,070
movie fall in love with the main guy

43
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:33,360
who's impossibly perfect and makes it

44
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,409
impossible for the rest of us to compete

45
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,720
and when I thought about it actually

46
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:38,369
gave me the idea that well I should do

47
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,509
that so I did here's a little trailer

48
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:41,250
representing pretty much every single

49
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:42,750
romantic movie ever made except for the

50
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,490
fact that it's not based off of a novel

51
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,930
and of course again it's not a real

52
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,310
movie it's just a trailer and also the

53
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,750
main guy is me which is well obviously

54
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,799
that would never happen because you know

55
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,420
bring my eyes

56
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,740
Hollywood would never cast somebody with

57
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,270
eyes like this but you know I have bad

58
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,740
eyesight and if you had eyes like this

59
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,420
you wouldn't be able to read the script

60
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,950
and also I mean let's just be honest

61
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,810
Hollywood would never cast somebody with

62
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,610
my type of race you know with my kind of

63
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,550
genes because I mean if there was like a

64
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,900
running scene or some

65
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,370
you know I would never believe these

66
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,840
things these jeans are way too big to

67
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,520
race in and of course the most obvious

68
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,250
reason that Hollywood would never cast

69
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,870
someone like me is because well I'm

70
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,100
white with mapping centers pretty much

71
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:20,680
every single romantic movie ever made

72
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:22,600
take a look when an obviously older than

73
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,130
20 year old high-school boy moves to a

74
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,640
new town you're gonna love it here

75
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,640

84
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,040
Cola

85
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,960

00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,230
you two should probably keep secrets

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,610
will be discovered Hey so I know you

101
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,050
don't talk that much but I was just

102
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,489
wondering if maybe we should meet up

103
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,320
after school to work on our magnet

104
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,640
mother was a coal miner but she died in

105
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,600
a coal mine after caved in and I'm

106
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,770
emotionally distraught and the only

107
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,000
thing that makes me happiest carving

108
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,570
figurines out of coal because it reminds

109
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,180
me of her

110
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:30,480
okay um I wasn't really asking you about

111
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:33,100
that but you save you're never going to

112
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,750
opposites will attract so since my

113
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:38,380
magnet is positive and your negative

114
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:41,620
should be able to attract thank you what

115
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:43,030
I like you like like you oh you were

116
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,590

117
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:48,159
sorry

118
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,159
doors will open

119
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:54,640
this is where I may call myself how

120
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:56,770
they're actually amazing you could sell

121
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,989
these that's it's now I make them with a

122
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:01,349
cute montage to show how perfect they

123
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,349
are together

124
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:18,630
with beautiful moving shots of inanimate

125
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,670
objects corny lines for teenage girls to

126
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,540
quote on Facebook love it's like a fart

127
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,270
it's warm

128
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,500
predictable sometimes it stinks but it

129
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,600
can also be the best feeling in the

130
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,840
world that's why I'm so happy I passed

131
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,240
through that day I know now I fart you

132
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,980
it's an insignificant act that will

133
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,020
probably make sense at the end of the

134
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,670
movie hey can I ask you something kind

135
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,250
