00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,369
is coming out but or it came out

31
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,939
recently you had Alan that came out

32
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:37,439
recently that's available for streaming

33
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,579
platforms and everything yeah Spotify

34
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,130
what's it what's the name of the album

35
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,930
supervised called limbo so June limbo

36
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,579
okay and the music video actually looks

37
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,680
really it looks legit like where did you

38
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:48,560
do that key that was in Korea so I went

39
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,340
all do it you got real kpop like

40
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,729
cinematographers and stuff cuz it allege

41
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,530
it

42
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:54,360
yeah they shoot a lot of like a Jerry

43
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,969
peak k-pop group stuff I don't know if I

44
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,890
don't like them for our stuff oh I mean

45
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:00,750
we can really for sure

46
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,329
yeah they look really good well I mean

47
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,159
no fancy you did the other one and those

48
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:07,439
look good but I think part of it is cuz

49
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,459
you had real dancers right yeah where we

50
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,500
were holding you back

51
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,480
no I think in Korea the film crews just

52
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,260
generally know how to shoot kpop stuff

53
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,459
very key

54
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,140
whereas out here it's like they're not

55
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:18,450
really used to how to shoot the dance to

56
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,489
make it look more kpop I guess that was

57
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,200
you you did that yeah I tried

58
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:24,540
so you've choreographed all of that and

59
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,760
everything no no no the recent one I had

60
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,189
a choreographer do the dance so what

61
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,590
what did you do then for that music

62
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:33,480
video I think so

63
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,250
the whole album and the project I kind

64
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,810
of oversaw the whole project and like

65
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:40,109
making the creative choices on like

66
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,670
style concept all that and then the

67
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:44,280
music video I guess technically all I

68
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,840
did was um I coordinated getting I was

69
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,730
kind of like a producer for a music

70
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,190
video um I didn't really direct it but I

71
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:52,290
still I kind of co-directed it I guess

72
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,579
and then I flew to Korea for just one

73
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,650
weekend to shoot it and then came back

74
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:58,319
does that happen very often were not

75
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:01,049
necessarily a company will hire people

76
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,209
to do it but an individual will I don't

77
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:05,819
think it happens that often cuz one it

78
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:08,700
involves like a ridiculous budget and to

79
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:10,829
like I guess the artist is supposed to

80
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,120
be focusing on being an artist and not

81
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:15,510
really handling all the little things

82
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,370
that make a production of production but

83
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:20,340
since I don't have a company nothing I

84
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,859
just kind of did it all yes right so I

85
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,750
mean for people who don't know Jun is

86
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:27,299
also a youtuber well you started it on

87
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:30,030
YouTube before all this yeah

88
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:33,750
and Jun has one point four million

89
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:35,400
subscribers 143 million total views but

90
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,500
a lot of those views and stuff were even

91
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,000
before you got into kpop it was a lot of

92
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,739
had to do with you I mean you're known

93
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,120
as the violinist right you used to do

94
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:47,430
violin covers of of k-pop songs but

95
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,250
after when when when did you get into

96
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:53,099
this whole like was it before BGA or

97
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,019
after BGA when you really started to I

98
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:58,079
don't know basically become a kpop star

99
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:59,909
well yeah I started off of youtube just

100
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,579
doing like pop songs like American top

101
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:05,280
40s covers on the violin it was kind of

102
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:07,709
an excuse for me to start the kind of

103
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,090
like keep playing the violin so I

104
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:11,549
started that when I was a freshman in

105
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:13,229
college and then kpop I think I just

106
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:15,720
started when somebody gave me a

107
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:17,639
recommendation to cover kpop song and I

108
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,260
was in a dance crew in college so I kind

109
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,560
of put those two together to do like

110
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,969
violin kpop dance covers and I was

111
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,790
already into that I guess before BG I

112
00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:27,980
think that's partially the reason why

113
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:31,640
Phil I think I fell David reached out to

114
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:33,470
me to be part of BGA and after BGA I

115
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,150
think yeah because I didn't know you

116
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,530
before that no I don't think so I think

117
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,640
that's when we first yeah and when

118
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:41,150
you're the only guy in the group that

119
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:45,320
actually like looks like a kpop person I

120
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:47,480
try it speaks well - yeah yeah I'm full

121
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,490
Korean so you're though so you can hear

122
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,050
when cuz apparently I didn't know but

123
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:53,000
apparently David's Korean isn't perfect

124
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:55,640
so you can hear that he's not good at

125
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,520
Korean no he's completely fluent Oh mom

126
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,990
are you yeah born in Kuwait you're not

127
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:06,800
like that great did you hear that um

128
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:08,810

great right no it's not

133
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,560
like we had to sometimes you'll have to

134
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,390
ask your friend when we're writing like

135
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,800

earlier when we're recording those songs

141
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,000
because me and Phil we can't speak like

142
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:43,430
any of it it's just making sounds to us

143
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,980
like I can't I mean I I couldn't have

144
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:47,240
known that you aren't great at speaking

145
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:50,330
Korean I suck

146
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,250
do you really know I'm really bad I was

147
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:54,830
not forced to speak Korean with my

148
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:57,560
parents growing up I wish they forced me

149
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:59,990
but they tried at one point and I was

150
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,220
like alright if they were like if you

151
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,990
don't speak to us in Korean we're not

152
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,060

153
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:10,640
alright fine I'm just not gonna talk to

154
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:12,410
you then it's holy backfire yeah but

155
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,390
what they did force you to do was play

156
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,950
instruments right yes yes how did you

157
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:18,080
know that because you're a musician oh

158
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:21,440
yeah true so yeah so I grew up playing

159
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,150
violin and piano I play a lot of played

160
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,430
since I was five

161
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,720
violent both instruments actually I hate

162
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:29,300
it so much

163
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,130
piano and violin both I hated both I

164
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:34,040
hate I hated practicing what about you

165
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:35,330
did you hate violin oh there was a time

166
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,520
when I really didn't want to practice in

167
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,860
the beginning when you start a fifth

168
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,540
grade fifth grade did you hate it in the

169
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,010
in the beginning it was kind of like um

170
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,690
well actually in the beginning I liked

171
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,310
it it was actually more out of spite

172
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,960
because I'm my best friend played the

173
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:49,370
violin and like you know when you're

174
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,630
young you have like playdates and stuff

175
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,130
like that people come over and we play

176
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,840
video games the one that he would always

177
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,280
for some reason bring his violin and

178
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,440
then kind of like the first 10 minutes

179
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:03,140
of our like hangout session is him

180
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:06,950
showing me like him playing violin like

181
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:08,330
hey I practiced and he would kind of

182
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,490
like kind of show off I guess right

202
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:59,090
I was I was great at math class that was

203
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,260
the only class that I was like I went up

00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:02,030
to the board and I did all the math

205
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,890
problems and then every other closets

206
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,560
every other class was pretty rough for

207
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:07,850
me really did you get bullied I didn't

208
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,430

program like pasta foreign kids program

210
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:16,790
so even if he did get bullied he

211
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:20,270
couldn't understand why I pushed in

212
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:21,680
stuff is like yes yes yes well it's

213
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:25,010
crazy you don't know I mean like I guess

214
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:28,250
you grew up lancaster agree with it what

215
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:31,400
ages at 7 like 9 finish oh really

216
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:33,710
yeah oh okay well I'm still kind of

217
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:36,680
surprising you have no accent whatsoever

218
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:43,789
no I'm really I mean I don't hear it I

219
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:45,110
hear seriously you're talking quick I

220
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:47,180
got a question here about your

221
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:51,140
instrument cuz you know that's your main

222
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:52,910
weapon of choice right in the violin I'm

223
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:56,810
wondering how

224
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:59,450
much does your violin cost it's pretty

225
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:02,030
to personal doing no it's like it's like

226
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:05,720
about the price of like mercedes-benz

227
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:07,490
like SUV I would say that's that's a lie

228
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,720
you're not even joking no I'm not even

229
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:10,340
joking do you

230
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,830
you own it yeah I own it I have

231
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,910
insurance on it it's like it's a I

232
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,960
forgot what it's called like when you

233
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:17,780
get something really expensive like

234
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,850
jewelry you right yeah yeah so you get

235
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,230
it appraised right yeah so my Valens

236
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,150
appraising and stuff like that cuz I

237
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:26,240
could be wrong but there there are

238
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:28,880
actually violins out there that are very

239
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,880
expensive and are rented out to people

240
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,470
right yeah yeah I think um there's

241
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,350
violence that can range up to like a

242
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:38,960
couple million and stuff that is stupid

243
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:43,550
yeah it's crazy for a piece of wood no I

244
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:46,030
mean like okay would you be if you if I

245
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:48,350
were to have a million dollar violin

246
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:51,980
somewhat not me like some who can play

247
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:53,810
it and mercedes-benz while it which is

248
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:56,060
150 grit know how much I don't want to

249
00:09:53,810 --> 00:10:01,250
how much is a I would say like around 50

250
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:02,750
50 grand violin and a cheap violin but

251
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,670
not like it's like around 100 hundred

252
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,050
bucks 200 if we were if they were all

253
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,210
were to play the same thing you would be

254
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,500
able to tell which is which actually it

255
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:11,510
might be kind of hard to tell the

256
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,300
difference between the Mercedes Benz and

257
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,590
the million dollar one but definitely

258
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,150
like the cheap cheap ones like the

259
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:19,610
factory made ones they're like the ones

260
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,930
that are like in like music shops like

261
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,850
for example like an instrument you get

262
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:24,620
at like sat match for example or

263
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:26,060
something like that is not probably not

264
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,040
that one I can tell the difference

265
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,210
between that and like my violin or like

266
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,030
a couple million dollar fine or

267
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:34,040
something hmm did you did you have - is

268
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,570
it like a payment thing or like how does

269
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,030
that usually work like you have to go

270
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:39,470
into a back alley or you go into yeah

271
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:42,200
you have to bring like a suitcase and

272
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:44,840
everything it's pretty pretty shady you

273
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,530
know it's hard to tell when you're being

274
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:53,030
sarcastic

275
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:55,390
yeah this is second language okay I

276
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,390
don't

277
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:00,500
what is the has anyone ever it's a

278
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:03,140
Stradivarius

279
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,510
yeah have you uh as anyone ever lets you

280
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,230
play it I've only touched the

281
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,000
Stradivarius

282
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,770
once I don't know what is this word what

283
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,870
is that it's the name of the person who

284
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:14,810
made the violin oh ah you haven't

285
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:16,250
touched him no no the violin that he

286
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,260
made I touched hundreds of years ago

287
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,610
right he was yeah couple hundred years

288
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,530
ago I think there's only two hundreds

289
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:23,390
treads in the whole world are we talking

290
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:26,060
about the Mercedes Ben no this is this

291
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:27,650
is the million dollar Oh God these are

292
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,240
the ones that are in museums and so how

293
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:31,880
can you even play them like what if you

294
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:34,790
dropped it like oh then the one that you

295
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,680
have Oh mine yeah that's like 50 grand

296
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:38,540
like what if there isn't do you

297
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,910
lose like 20 that's 20 grand already

298
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:43,610
like you don't think we do like crash

299
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:45,290
your car yeah you fix it so like I think

300
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:47,930
David can speak from experience but like

301
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:49,340
um people fix it it's like piece of wood

302
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,690
and then it's still worth the same like

303
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:53,480
my violin for example it's like almost

304
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:55,670
like 300 years old mine and then there's

305
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,050
like a section on the bottom of the vial

306
00:11:55,670 --> 00:12:02,710
and it's completely shattered and

307
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:02,710
reglued so it's been older than America

308
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:16,400
1776 so I mean like okay so if you if it

309
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,390
was really me 300 years ago and you're

310
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,220
saying there's a bunch of these right

311
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:20,960
even older than that that are worth more

312
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,940
it's kind of like wine and get it's

313
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:27,230
worth more as time goes on

314
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:28,670
mm-hmm do you know the previous owners

315
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,800
like how did you how did it get into

316
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:32,150
your hands I actually don't know the

317
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,820
previous owners but it was made in

318
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:37,310
Germany for example and I mean not for

319
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:41,060
example it was made in Germany I got it

320
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:42,200
from my violin person in New York he

321
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,230
does a lot of like professional

322
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:47,060
violinist like um probably don't know

323
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:49,760
but like Midori caught them like these

324
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:53,270
people are um Midori is green Japanese

325
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:55,790
oh really yeah a lot of names for anime

326
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:58,160
sorry I didn't mean oh no that's but

327
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:59,660
then on the he he has a lot of those

328
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,040
like really expensive islands and like

329
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,750
cheaper ones I don't know where he got

330
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,020
it from but I got it from him in New

331
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,140
York

332
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:08,390
yeah can I thought will be could you pay

333
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:11,330
for it sorry well my parents didn't you

334
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:13,580
my grandpa my grandpa grandma helped out

335
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:16,010
a lot on Lawrence to like an investment

336
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,600
it's kind of I mean if you keep it like

337
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:19,110
no I'm thinking about it like it's like

338
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,459
gold right you just keep in

339
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:22,470
violet you should get a bunch of

340
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:24,690
violations hold on to it that's a coin

341
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:27,029
that's always Bitcoin it wasn't a

342
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:29,700
mercedes-benz you a SUV cost when I got

343
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:32,700
it Oh what was that the Passat because

344
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:34,560
of inflation that's probably partially

345
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,510
that too but then another thing is um

346
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,370
violins like the more you play it the

347
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:40,410
more the sound develops as in the sound

348
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:42,060
that my violin made when I first got it

349
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,860
and now it's completely this wow that's

350
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,079
the opposite of a car yeah I guess we

351
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,230
can drive it the worse it is oh so do

352
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,540
you

353
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:50,610
yeah that's kind of interesting yeah so

354
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:53,070
you could just have like a farm right a

355
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:55,470
violinist buy a bunch and just have them

356
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:59,250
play all day and in you're making money

357
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:01,170
yeah yeah right yes it's appreciate

358
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,850
that's yeah but like I mean like how did

359
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:04,470
pottery if you're reselling it like how

360
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:06,930
can you prove like okay this is played

361
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:08,940
for like a thousand hours since I got it

362
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,709
so it's worth that much more I think it

363
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,019
really depends on like the professionals

364
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:14,730
opinion like I'm not in the right so

365
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,950
like I can't really decide what it costs

366
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,450
is but I bring it back to the guy he

367
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:20,130
fixes it up for like a week comes back

368
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:22,140
and he's like probably like cool so they

369
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:25,050
do but they realize oh you played this

370
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:26,910
so X amount but they can hear it as a

371
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:28,500
sound and stuff like see how much the

372
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:31,079
sound is and it's more and stuff like

373
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:33,720
that they can they have like yeah it's a

374
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:35,550
combination of like the sound it's the

375
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,649
combination of looking through the

376
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:41,130
sometimes like the person who made it

377
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:42,420
will put like a signature inside the

378
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,070
violin too and you can kind of

379
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,839
authenticate that but how do you know

380
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:47,370
how much it's been played as I'm saying

381
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,870
you can't really tell that but you can

382
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,610
kind of like measure look at the wood

383
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:53,279
and there's a lot of different factors

384
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:55,110
that are involved with that so I think

385
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:58,140
it's because my parents own a music

386
00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:00,029
store my mom is a restores she does that

387
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,829
she does that for a loose take your

388
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:03,750
thing to him and then see how much more

389
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:05,880
since you've been playing it actually

390
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,890
what you should do is just start the

391
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,480
farm man like start the pile there's a

392
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,709
good business you know I know you

393
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,430
actually bring up a good point because

394
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:15,750
actually some of the more expensive

395
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:19,110
instruments that my mom has she actually

396
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,949
has people play it she should make it

397
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,930
worth more

398
00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:23,730
yeah because it opens out even more yeah

399
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:26,130
you know like a violin sitting in a

400
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:28,050
museum like for several years will sound

401
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:29,880
pretty bad I don't think the average

402
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,440
person knows like I didn't know anything

403
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,769
I didn't know violence cost that much

404
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,329
for one

405
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:35,950
now I'm starting to think every violin

406
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:38,500
I've ever seen how much was that really

407
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:40,269
warlike Lindsey sterling her violins

408
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,160
can't be worth that much right I think

409
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:43,870
when it's when you put electric when

410
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,510
it's an electric violin which is what

411
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:49,750
she usually plays those it's worth less

412
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:51,100
worth less yeah because there's that it

413
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,630
doesn't really depend on the wood and

414
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,959
stuff it's more technology that makes it

415
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:58,899
so much so you're almost like a kpop

416
00:15:55,959 --> 00:16:00,600
Lindsey Stirling in a way yeah I dance I

417
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:03,579
play violin yeah yeah and I guess a

418
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,260
transition into that because we need to

419
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:07,959
talk about kpop I kind of want to know

420
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:11,230
and touch up on I guess your your

421
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:14,320
history in your past and how you kind of

422
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:15,880
got into kpop and how you're like trying

423
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,860
to integrate it into your YouTube

424
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:22,000
channel and did you even audition for

425
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:25,300
like did you even audition for like you

426
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,240
know actual k-pop groups yeah I I

427
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:31,810
addition once in college and then once I

428
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,610
got um I guess notified from some

429
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:34,930
company when I moved out to LA right

430
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,670
after college but um

431
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:38,740
kpop was just always something I

432
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:42,370
listened to because my sister's really

433
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:53,350
big kpop em she still is and a shout out

434
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:56,529
to her but Harrison gets one thank you

435
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:58,180
which Macaulay a kpop I just got into

436
00:16:56,529 --> 00:17:00,399
cuz somebody recommended me like praying

437
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:03,279
playing a k-pop song and I danced in

438
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,079
college so kind of combined it to and I

439
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,850
made a cover people liked it and then I

440
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:09,520
started listening to kpop I started in

441
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:11,770

451
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,970
coincidence it's never happened before

there's girls here now we know David you

00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:09,260
have to live here anyway if more weird

458
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,370
things happen I mean we're going through

459
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:16,190
the footage when you go through the

460
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:19,100
footage crazy-eyed even though that

461
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:21,440
first thing fell to be honest for our

462
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:25,400
listeners there's two large bangs you

463
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:27,260
heard actually you might have heard some

464
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,050
voices because it's being recorded I

465
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:32,350
don't know a couple of our painting

466
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:35,930
things fell like right back to back and

467
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:36,320
they didn't fall all day so like I don't

468
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:39,230
know

469
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:43,210
yeah it's really weird uh-huh anyway

470
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:45,200
getting back on top every time so Julie

471
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:46,730
actually has a good point

472
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,250
do you believe in ghosts cuz you you

473
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:51,140
said just now you were like oh man I got

474
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,870
like goosebumps no I got a lot of

475
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:55,520
goosebumps um I don't I don't I don't

476
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:56,930
want to believe in ghosts I think it's a

477
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,520
mentality thing where if you don't

478
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:09,200
believe it and you're strong but you do

479
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:10,760
if you're strong so it's really

480
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,100
interesting to me because there's I've

481
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,870
heard a lot of stories about the kpop

482
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,850
industry especially as of late right

483
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:18,590
there's some articles going around like

484
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:21,530
about how little they get paid actually

485
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:23,090
for how much they're bringing in I don't

486
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:25,880
know what's true I've heard some stories

487
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:28,070
but since you've been kind of in that

488
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,940
world not that you're you you went down

489
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:33,650
that industry route are those there is

490
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:36,230
there truth to those rumors of what like

491
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:37,880
how poorly they're treated like or I

492
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:39,170
mean David knows too you know a lot of

493
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,680
people in that industry yeah I've heard

494
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:44,530
I've definitely heard some stories yeah

495
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:47,500
you know I think I think something

496
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:50,170
important to note is that we only know

497
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:52,600
of like SM yg JYP like a lot of these

498
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:54,550
big big hit now at BTS we know these big

499
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,080
groups big companies but there's like

500
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:58,180
hundreds of entertainment companies on

501
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,010
in Korea and there's like thousands and

502
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:02,620
thousands of kids that are trainees that

503
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:04,030
may never even get to debut even if they

504
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,890
like they might be a trainee for 10

505
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:08,050
years and they might not get chosen to

506
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:10,120
debut so there's so many people in that

507
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:13,090
industry that it's kind of like hard to

508
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,680
say like this one example like is the

509
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:17,620
same for all of it but I think there is

510
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:19,930
a lot of truth in those stories don't

511
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:21,760
just exist for no reason I feel like no

512
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:24,070
no that's like that's something I never

513
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,260
really like have like a strong opinion

514
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:27,970
on well I only know because I mean we

515
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,130
know some people in that industry and

516
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:32,650
I've heard stories not to say that I

517
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:36,160
know it's true or not but since you guys

518
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:37,540
are more I mean you know more than I do

519
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,060
I mean I've heard things were like they

520
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:43,000
force you know the trainees or whatever

521
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:44,590
to essentially like they they force him

522
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,350
to get like plastic surgery for

523
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:50,170
sometimes and they force them to even

524
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:52,060
like do sexual things with people like

525
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:53,920
kind of [ __ ] them out yeah

526
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,480
but so you know that that so it is true

527
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:59,230
that's true so you know from personal

528
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:02,140
experience yeah actually yeah I know

529
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:03,940
someone should I even say this story I

530
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:09,900
won't say names I don't say names but I

531
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:12,280
will say that I know someone who was

532
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:14,950
spilled of that industry I'm trying to

533
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:20,140
be very careful be careful this person

534
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:25,770
offered services quote-unquote services

535
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:28,030
to somebody I know who is wealthy for

536
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:30,460
basically hinting at if you pay me I

00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:31,690
will do I will sleep with you and

538
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,530

they told you this know the rich person

542
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:43,450
the rigid person told me this I so it is

543
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,220
true then because I've heard that and

544
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:46,750
I'm not I didn't hear it from David I've

545
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,090
heard it from someone completely

546
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:52,030
unrelated so it is truth that stuff

547
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,870
happens and I also heard that not only

548
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:55,150
do they do that

549
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:57,700
they do it for a reason because

550
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:59,620
if you ever go against the label but the

551
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:02,290
label does is they basically use it as

552
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:03,700
as blackmail so if you ever go against

553
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:05,170
them they'll release that information

554
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,760
and they'll have some kind of like sex

555
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:09,400
tape or some kind of scandal to cut

556
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:11,380
basically just ruin your reputation in

557
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,480
Korea yeah right and it's way worse

558
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:16,990
there yeah in Korea if you have a sex

559
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:19,570
tape your your career is over

560
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:28,240
right whereas in America it's just it's

561
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:28,929
just begun Jun any you got a black male

562
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,410
Jun

563
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:34,270
we've already becomes the big star so I

564
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:36,309
mean like I guess since you kind of

565
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,720
almost got into that world I'm kind of

566
00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:39,340
curious actually because there is there

567
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,770
or there are a lot of benefits to going

568
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,750
down that route right like you you get

569
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:45,640
instant exposure well not I guess like

570
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,860
you said it's not for everyone yeah but

571
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:50,380
I think I think if you debut so again

572
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,610
it's like if you're a trainee it doesn't

573
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,620
you don't really get the benefits except

574
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:56,110
like the resources but once you debut I

575
00:22:53,620 --> 00:23:00,040
think like in the big three like SM ji

576
00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:01,630
Pyg I think definitely um you get that

577
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:04,780
instant exposure literally overnight

578
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:06,520
fame like if you if ji p posts a teaser

579
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:09,010
for a new group they're instantly famous

580
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:11,080
overnight kind of thing and they do a

581
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:12,429
lot of press marketing as well as again

582
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,040
like financially they help with all the

583
00:23:12,429 --> 00:23:16,390
resources training music video budget

584
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,770
all that kind of stuff like you seem

585
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:20,950
like the kpop music videos they're like

586
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:22,420
pretty insane scale wise so I think

587
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:24,670
there's a lot of benefits in that and

588
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:27,460
but also a lot of downsides as you

589
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:29,020
mentioned right and doing it

590
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,640
independently I think it's a lot more

591
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,080
fun in my opinion because I get to

592
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,320
control everything and I think that's

593
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,570
more important to me then I guess like

594
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:40,360
being famous like that quick very easily

595
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:43,330
I guess yeah so for all those young kids

596
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:46,270
out there who look at k-pop stars and

597
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:47,700
aspire to be like them how do you become

598
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:52,960
a kpop star

599
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:54,910
I don't be Korean or Asian actually know

600
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,120
they're expanding yeah there's a Thai

601
00:23:54,910 --> 00:24:00,400
there's a lot of like um like half

602
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:04,780
Korean people there's a lot of Chinese a

603
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:06,429
lot of Thai and yeah that's it's not

604
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:08,140
it's not limited to being Korean I think

605
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:08,790
I think it's if you have what it takes

606
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,560
like talent

607
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,880
wise as well as you have the passion I

608
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,410
think the most important thing is the

609
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,300
passion to do it because it's not just

610
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:17,610
about you being good at something you

611
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,980
have to like looking like a kpop idol

612
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:21,840
right because there's that like image

613
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,970
static k-pop idol has when you're on

614
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,920
stage f2l you look really pretty really

615
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:28,200
cute really like cool or like sexy or

616
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,120
whatever it is you kind of have to like

617
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,230
fit in that world you have to have what

618
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:34,260
it takes and I think that's the thing

619
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:36,330
that makes somebody a k-pop idol or

620
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:38,460
artist more so than the music or the

621
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:40,290
talent cuz that like you just changed a

622
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:42,240
kpop song to English it becomes American

623
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:44,670
pop it's not right I don't think I never

624
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,710
thought kpop was at genre kpop is like a

625
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:49,350
whole package just pop in Korean yeah

626
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:52,020
and you just have to have the image the

627
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:53,310
dancing the production all that package

628
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,140
that's what makes it there's actually a

629
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:56,880
lot of controversy about that too right

630
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:59,850
isn't there like a what is that the

631
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,930
award show is announcing a kpop category

632
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:05,520
and BTS fans are really upset because

633
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:08,340
they're they feel like they're putting

634
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,230
they created that category just so that

635
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,750
they're not competing against other pop

636
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:16,440
artists and because BTS is huge right

637
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:17,910
now so I forget I can't even remember

638
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,990
what award is something big I don't know

639
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:23,940
if it's like Grammys or didn't I know

640
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,980
there there is a there was a lot of

641
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:28,680
contrary recently they announced it and

642
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:30,960
there was a bunch of like BTS people who

643
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:33,540
are really upset and and it is that's I

644
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,160
I mean I get it but it's kind of like

645
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,990
why wouldn't they be allowed in the pop

646
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,450
category yeah you know it's still pop

647
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:43,560
and there is English in it like I don't

648
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:46,650
know it's lose the MTV MTV VMA Awards oh

649
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:54,930
that's nothing what are they getting mad

650
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:56,610
over speaking about being cancelled

651
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:58,110
right and stuff like that like don't you

652
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:59,310
think like if you ever were to make it

653
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,870
like the goal is to make it big right

654
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:02,910
like if you ever were to make it big

655
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:04,920
don't you think aren't you worried that

656
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:07,290
these like we just talked about all dark

657
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:09,030
and dirty these labels play aren't you

658
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:10,350
worried that that you're like going

659
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:12,870
against the grain and you're like

660
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:16,200
sitting example for people like they do

661
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:17,430
you must I mean you you will be on their

662
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,890
target list like they don't want people

663
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:21,360
to create themselves on their own they

664
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:22,590
want you to be like hey we need this

665
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,059
label to make it

666
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:26,190
aren't you afraid at some point they're

667
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:27,659
gonna target you or maybe it had they

668
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:30,240
reached out to you already to try and

669
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:33,090
get you under them mmm no I mean I do

670
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,559
get like like some like it's like no

671
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:36,809
name entertainment labels sometimes

672
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:39,149
reach out to me here and there but um I

673
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:40,860
don't think gun like a target one

674
00:26:39,149 --> 00:26:42,570
because like I think I'm still starting

675
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:45,509
and I'm still kind of discovering myself

676
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:47,700
and this music career side of things but

677
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:49,860
I think the beauty is that my YouTube

678
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,019
channel has me for like the past eight

679
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,669
nine years mm-hmm and you can see the

680
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:55,559
full history of me right and I think

681
00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:57,210
that's something that's very nice to

682
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:59,519
have like almost like a portfolio for

683
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:01,409
myself and I think people looking to be

684
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:03,360
in the kpop industry like there's one

685
00:27:01,409 --> 00:27:05,730
part that they have to think about what

686
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,220
do they have to lose for me a big choice

687
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:09,960
of not joining a label was because I had

688
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:12,450
too much to lose because I had that

689
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:15,330
whole like I guess like um portfolio of

690
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:16,950
me being a YouTube violinist that if I

691
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:18,269
did sign to label for example they'd

692
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,769
probably like make me get rid of my

693
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:21,659
youtube channel maybe get rid of my

694
00:27:19,769 --> 00:27:23,159
Instagram anything so like wow I have a

695
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:25,320
fresh new plate that's how they would

696
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:27,389
that's how they like their I donate

697
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,369
right so they can write everything for

698
00:27:27,389 --> 00:27:31,649
them and they interesting kind of things

699
00:27:29,369 --> 00:27:33,749
is that that's one thing I think is a

700
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:36,539
little bit different because in like the

701
00:27:33,749 --> 00:27:38,009
American industry for example like they

702
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:39,299
won't do that like the artist has full

703
00:27:38,009 --> 00:27:42,720
control right and I think that's always

704
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:44,009
how I should be um but in but kpop I

705
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,690
think is just completely different the

706
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:47,369
culture is different and what they're

707
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:49,080
looking for in k-pop idols and how that

708
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:50,850
markets how that sells it's completely

709
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,440
different from like Justin Bieber for

710
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:55,649
example it's a totally different image

711
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,149
so I think it works for that end but for

712
00:27:55,649 --> 00:27:59,129
me I don't think I need to like

713
00:27:57,149 --> 00:28:01,019
necessarily keep myself tight to kpop

714
00:27:59,129 --> 00:28:02,850
mm-hmm necessarily because I'm it just

715
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:05,340
made sense for my demographic to do kpop

716
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:06,960
right now but I would consider myself

717
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:09,779
more of a korean-american artist rather

718
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:13,019
than a kpop artist interested it kind of

719
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:15,480
sounds like the packaging for Korea is

720
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:17,159
really about inorganic you know like

721
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,269
everything is oh it's almost like

722
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:19,529
plastic surgery which is something

723
00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:22,559
that's widely accepted they're like they

724
00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:26,419
wanted everything to look clean-cut well

725
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:29,340
produced we're in the more Western

726
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:33,090
westernized the entertainment it's kinda

727
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:35,890
just like be edgy be original make your

728
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:38,440
own stuff but still have like

729
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:41,740
hints a formula there yeah yeah for sure

730
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:43,120
yeah so I what are you looking since you

731
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:46,000
said that you know this is what you want

732
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,549
to do for now what is your your next

733
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,799
goals because after uh

734
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:52,929
I guess this kpop days is over for you

735
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:55,899
whenever well this mini album was like

736
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:57,940
kind of me just really trying to getting

737
00:28:55,899 --> 00:29:00,220
get it out of my system like I have a

738
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:01,960
physical CD I have a music video I have

739
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:03,909
a lot of like I I featured an actual

740
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,370
k-pop idol and one of these songs and

741
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:07,690
then um so it's just something that I

742
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,220
really wanted to get out of my system

743
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:11,590
because I never was able to do it and

744
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:13,240
finally I got to do it so honestly right

745
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:15,100
now I'm kind of just like I don't know

746
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,899
what I really want to do I kind of want

747
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:19,240
to see where this album goes yeah as

748
00:29:16,899 --> 00:29:21,789
well as work on music that's not maybe

749
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,960
not in Korean I'm just like and I want

750
00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:24,370
to kind of bring the violin back because

751
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,960
I think I kind of pushed that away on

752
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:28,389
purpose because I wanted to like really

753
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,010
focus on like original like singing

754
00:29:28,389 --> 00:29:32,289
rapping that kind of stuff but I want to

755
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:33,700
bring the violin back and see how can I

756
00:29:32,289 --> 00:29:35,740
can incorporate that in my future

757
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,690
content so so you'd be open to

758
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,919
continuing this if this blows up for you

759
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:40,450
and does like really well yeah I mean I

760
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:42,370
don't think it necessarily needs to blow

761
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:44,049
up but I think I want to follow it

762
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:47,019
because it's still a passion for me like

763
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:48,880
music is still a big passion but maybe

764
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:51,880
kind of seeing where that might lead me

765
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:54,460
with like my film side of stuff - yeah

766
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,769
soundtrack stuff maybe is the YouTube

767
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:59,980
enough to kind of sustain a career for

768
00:29:56,769 --> 00:30:02,760
you I would say I took a really big

769
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:05,380
hiatus like two years no violin playing

770
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,700
no violin covers and like content on

771
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,590
YouTube for a while and like YouTube is

772
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,970
kind of it's very important that you

773
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:13,149
know like you have that consistency on

774
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:15,130
YouTube to maintain that number so all

775
00:30:13,149 --> 00:30:18,100
the fans watching my content right now

776
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:20,019
on my channel are were originally there

777
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,580
for the violin content not for the k-pop

778
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:23,409
content so I would say I'm I've

779
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:25,679
rebranded my YouTube it's almost like

780
00:30:23,409 --> 00:30:28,690
starting on your YouTube channel so I'm

781
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:32,639
right now not now I don't think so but

782
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:34,750
um I think hopefully eventually yeah

783
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:37,120
because it's because I know there's a

784
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:39,070
lot of musicians out there that you know

785
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,679
it's it's difficult to do music

786
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:42,760
full-time right you know you're lucky

787
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,580
you're one of the lucky ones if you're

788
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:47,020
able to so you know when it comes to

789
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,820
making money

790
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:51,760
I know YouTube pays

791
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:53,470
percentage of ad revenue and then you

792
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,320
know you sell merch do you have a

793
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:58,030
patreon do you do you do live shows like

794
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,670
is that kind of where do you make money

795
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:03,250
as well or Randle's yeah I think right

796
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:04,600
now it shows shows were the biggest like

797
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,950
last year for example I did a lot of

798
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,650
like university shows with like my

799
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:10,600
violin content and then moving forward I

800
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:12,490
think I have like a physical album CD

801
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,050
that came out that was actually mostly

802
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:15,460
again kind of getting it out of my

803
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:17,470
system like I can say I have like a

804
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:19,000
legit k-pop album I was like little

805
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:21,970
photo cards and stuff like that so

806
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,100
that's one merch possibly like more like

807
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:26,830
t-shirt merch merch I think is always an

808
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:28,450
option moving forward but um for now

809
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:29,110
it's still more of a passion project I

810
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:31,600
would say

811
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:34,450
so for fans you want to support you what

812
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,250
are the top two revenue generators for

813
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:39,120
you where they can support and help you

814
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:42,730
you know get to a full-time position

815
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:45,490
mm-hmm I would have to say just stream

816
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:47,470
it and like 10 million 30 million just

817
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:50,470
keep streaming hit that refresh button

818
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:51,820
or you could start the violin farm or do

819
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,990
violin from you I'm telling you man

820
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:55,000
that's a good business

821
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:56,260
it sounds like telling you I don't know

822
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,520
what the numbers are actually but it

823
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:59,050
sounds like it could be a good business

824
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,210
it's a good return it just takes a long

825
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:15,960
time hounds like it could be a good

826
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:18,580
business on this horrible transition

827
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:21,700
let's go into some some questions we got

828
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:26,080
from Twitter yeah that sounds good

829
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:30,560
sorry I'm reading like these are so good

830
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,710

it to the point when puck was that like

849

like the Malay actually did I didn't

858
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:36,360
realize till later on whenever you know

859
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:38,010
how you do Q&A here and there sometimes

860
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,840

00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:41,520

891
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,770
a deep

892
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:13,010
that's a major dislike at fish it's like

893
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:15,400
he was waiting to see a real place

894
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:17,840
because we have the back of the dead

895
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,900
yeah like I have no reason to hate

896
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:24,740
Justin that was just I forced that one

897
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:26,570

pretty mean to you as well no but that's

901
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:37,670
like I mean that so that became a thing

902
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:39,560
on the first shoot I think after a

903
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,940
little bit and naturally progressed and

904
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:44,000
in the second one I started writing it

905
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:45,590
in because it just naturally progressed

906
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,810
it's like it's a realist in the young

907
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:49,910
boy you see the Otis yeah yes the oldest

908
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:50,900
and the youngest and it's like a natural

909
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:52,490
like it's funny you think the

910
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,540
relationship works but it's really like

911
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:55,460
that in real life too

912
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:57,080
yeah it's a it's carried on it's yeah

913
00:35:55,460 --> 00:36:00,800
it's not it's not an on-screen thing

914
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:02,120
it's just naturally like yeah he'll do

915
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,390
it even if the cameras were off right

916
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:08,600
now Justin's voice in my head as soon as

917
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:11,000
said catfish like that high-pitched

918
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:15,230
voice I don't I don't think he sounds

919
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,660
like that very good impersonation in

920
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:20,420
person but you know what I'm saying he

921
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:20,690
did say that he he would make love to

922
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:23,060
you

923
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:25,940
and I did I I don't know if you believe

924
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:27,950
that he would but it wasn't a sarcastic

925
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:31,010
he did say that he did say that I mean

926
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:31,400
he he twee he said he would grab you by

927
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,870
the hair

928
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,570
we don't have we're not trying to

929
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:36,230
demonetized here yeah but he'll say

930
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:38,840
things like that

931
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:41,210
yeah and he won't say just kidding mm

932
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:42,680
even though we know just so you know

933
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:45,980
it's a love-hate relationships all of

934
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:49,520
hate relation but anyway so we have a

935
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:50,990
few more I want to know this but I don't

936
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,640
know I don't know where this one came

937
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:55,670
from have you ever had any rude

938
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,500
encounters from famous k-pop idols rude

939
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:59,240
encounters or maybe a wholesome

940
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,780
encounters I want to hear the rude ones

941
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,040
yeah

942
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,780
give me the rude ones cuz I'm sure

943
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,850
you've come across a bunch since you go

944
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:06,380
to kcon and you do all those like you

945
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:08,890
know you're kind of in that industry no

946
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,890
yeah

947
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:14,570
at kcon I do this thing I do a lot of

948
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:16,580
things where I'm IMC because I'm

949
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:17,930
bilingual um so they have these things

950
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,320
called fan engagements where they come

951
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:19,820
on stay

952
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,230
age they answer like Twitter questions

953
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:23,570
like this like kind of like this setting

954
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:24,620
a gonna interview but I take the

955
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:25,940
questions I asked him in Korean I

956
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:28,370
translate it for an audience and stuff

957
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:30,500
like that I won't say a groups name

958
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:32,420
because I don't want to like cause kpop

959
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:36,430
yeah I don't say names actually you

960
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:38,930
could that's terrifying people but then

961
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:42,050
there was this one specific member of

962
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:44,210
this girl group that was just completely

963
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:45,830
different on stage and how she was

964
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:48,170
offstage like the second she got

965
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:49,400
offstage she like called for a manager

966
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:51,320
got like where's my water where's my

967
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,000
water like a diva I could not not just a

968
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:57,530
diva there like a diva but it's super

969
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,350
like like a really [ __ ] diva like to

970
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:02,480
the point where like on stage she was

971
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:04,130
like I really have the second she came

972
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,830
down her smile just disappeared her face

973
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:09,020
just completely changed right so I don't

974
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:10,730
think it was rude to me I think people

975
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:12,350
dealing with her honored right would

976
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:14,810
feel that she's very rude all the time

977
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:16,820
but maybe she was having a bad day or

978
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:23,170
something but that's the bad one what's

979
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:27,080
your name what does it rhyme with Oh

980
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:30,140
drink the the kpop fans woman is that

981
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,680
the girl group like Pink's oh no I did

982
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,060
not say that

983
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:34,940
no no but that's like one of the biggest

984
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:37,940
girl groups right yeah it was them it

985
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:45,830
was them we're just gonna start it well

986
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:47,480
figure out which one June said okay so I

987
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:48,710
mean well that kind of goes back to what

988
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,390
we were talking about though like it's

989
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:52,970
very artificial right not nothing

990
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:54,380
everybody is like that but to a certain

991
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:56,690
degree like they have to be like the

992
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:58,160
cutesy personality on stage if not it's

993
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:00,500
that's there's a reason why they're all

994
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,480
they act very similar yeah and it's it's

995
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,070
kinda you understand that right yeah

996
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,020
following like a formula and stuff like

997
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:07,100
that like I have like for example for me

998
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:09,650
like I have to say nice things about

999
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:13,960
Justin to have that facade of me being

1000
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:13,960
the nice member of the behave exactly

1001
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:26,210
the scenes are just making out kind of

1002
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:29,210
going off of that what is the weirdest

1003
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:31,760
fan encounter you've had that I've had

1004
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:34,760
um cuz I mean this is a question we

1005
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,320
usually ask like the girls cuz usually

1006
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:39,260
their stores are pretty wild it's always

1007
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:41,990
stalkers yeah but have you had any weird

1008
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:44,300
ones I'm sure mmm

1009
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:46,520
I think it was I forget if it was that a

1010
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:48,230
Kate Connor so I'm no it was at one of

1011
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,580
the cake cons most of my experience has

1012
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:52,250
come from kcon because that's one of the

1013
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:54,530
kpop fans come there was one fan that

1014
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:56,660
literally followed me everywhere knew

1015
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:59,060
which hotel I was in so there's a

1016
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:01,010
stalker story hmm yeah but this one was

1017
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:02,750
weird cuz I'm like I don't know how she

1018
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:04,640
knew but then like the next like one

1019
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:06,560
like I saw her at the hotel in the lobby

1020
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,090
and she made eye contact then I like you

1021
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,980
know like when you see a person then

1022
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:11,690
they recognize you and like and stuff

1023
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:13,100
like that so I was like oh it's a fan

1024
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:14,780
stuff like that we took a picture she

1025
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:16,760
asked for a picture and then and then

1026
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:18,500
the next morning I woke up I was getting

1027
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,520
ready to go to the convention I walked

1028
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,190
out of my room and she was in the

1029
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,360
hallway and she was just sitting in the

1030
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:24,740
corner of the hallway she's something

1031
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,060
she's like oh shoot I'm sorry and she's

1032
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:27,860
like that's a bunch of stuff but I was

1033
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:29,690
honestly like really creeped out to say

1034
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:31,850
anything or like comprehend what was

1035
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:34,910
happening but then that happened to date

three days in a row dude yeah she was

1037
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:38,120
scary stuff like that so that was a

1038
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:40,250
slightly creepy the third day she's just

1039
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:43,610
sitting outside your door oh that was so

1040
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:45,880

1066
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:53,460
getting into the singing rapping stuff

1067
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:54,930
like that it would be really nice to

1068
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:56,880
have a song together I think would be

1069
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:58,410
really nice but um she's reliving -

1070
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,880
right yeah she's phone and griemann how

1071
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:02,190
does she feel about all of this success

1072
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,230
that you're experiencing right now well

1073
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:07,380
she's kind of like my reality check

1074
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:10,110
always as in like she'll humble you

1075
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:11,670
humble me maybe a little too much in

1076
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:13,560
what ways though like what it was like

1077
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:15,510
what I can't imagine you being cocky or

1078
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,950
I mean yeah that's like generally I

1079
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:18,120
don't but like for example like when

1080
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:19,500
you're in a relationship or like with

1081
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:22,080
family or something you kind of want

1082
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:23,940
that like like them to kind of credit

1083
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,470
you or just like crazy a little bit you

1084
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:28,140
know like kind of like that child in me

1085
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:29,310
that I want like my girlfriend to watch

1086
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:31,320
my video and be like oh my god you look

1087
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:32,940
so good and stuff like that for example

1088
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,260
like she'd compliment but at the same

1089
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:36,780
time humbled me at the same time she's

1090
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:38,250
look at my most recent music video for

1091
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:40,440
example she would watch it and she'd be

1092
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:42,650
like who is that guy he's so

1093
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,650
good-looking

1094
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:51,060
it's like a compliment but yeah so she

1095
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,500
is compliment think she is appreciating

1096
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:54,180
but at the same time she knows to like

1097
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:56,040
make sure it doesn't get to my head and

1098
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:59,910
stuff got it got it do you think it

1099
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:01,380
makes some of your fans jealous that you

1100
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:03,900
have it you're taken you think her um

1101
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:06,690
yeah I think initially like we've been

1102
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:08,190
public for a while but um I guess some

1103
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:09,480
people still don't know even though I

1104
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:12,120
post pictures with her all the time and

1105
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:14,280
stuff like that but um there are

1106
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:17,430
instances when people do get jealous and

1107
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:19,020
are really mean to her on her Instagram

1108
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:20,850
for example people like make fake a

1109
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:22,320
constant like you really mean on our

1110
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:25,020
Instagram well isn't it normally like

1111
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:26,760
the kpop like people bands like people

1112
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:28,800
what they don't have relationships right

1113
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:30,390
no that's like a big like if you have a

1114
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,580
girlfriend boyfriend than your career

1115
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:34,530
and isn't there a thing to like I don't

1116
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:36,240
know because I just read bja comments

1117
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:38,640
isn't anything like that there's usually

1118
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,290
a couple guys that like you and Justin

1119
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,860
who do have some kind of bromance thing

1120
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:42,450
going on

1121
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:45,180
yeah the group there's always one right

1122
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:46,380
yeah yeah how many how many not that I

1123
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:49,140
don't know that you would know how many

1124
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:51,930
of those actual like bands either how

1125
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:53,640
many how many gay people are in the kpop

1126
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:55,810
industry do you think

1127
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:58,750
personally I think there is plenty

1128
00:43:55,810 --> 00:44:00,820
really there's a lot but you're right

1129
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:02,950
it's not accepted in Korea it's accepted

1130
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:04,840
like out here like people like kpop fans

1131
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:06,820
prefer that yeah it seems like it

1132
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,380
because they would rather have two

1133
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:09,820
members dating each other than them

1134
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:11,140
dating different girls right because

1135
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:12,790
they don't want to like ruin the facade

1136
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:14,290
yeah they want that fantasy of being

1137
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:15,820
able to be with them at one point but if

1138
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:18,010
I'm not able to get you then I'd rather

1139
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:20,200
have right David be with you for example

1140
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:21,930
doing this that's kind of I just had an

1141
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:24,970
image in my head

1142
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:30,730
