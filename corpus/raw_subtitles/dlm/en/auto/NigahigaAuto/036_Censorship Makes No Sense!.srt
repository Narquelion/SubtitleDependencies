1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,460
so you're probably wondering why is he

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:12,509
sitting down I recently heard my ankle

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:14,580
in a pickup game in basketball you pick

4
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:15,599
it up no but really I did hurt my ankle

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,100
actually I could probably do this

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,680
standing I'm just being a little bit

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:28,380
he's sworn oh I was talking about my dog

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:29,250
who is a boy oh my god hey guys so today

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,990
I'm gonna be talking about something

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,980
that may give me a lot of angry letters

11
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:38,340
from parents obviously not that kind of

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,329
letters that's better

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,680
I'm gonna be talking about something

14
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:45,030
that has been bothering me since I was a

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:47,160
little kid censorship is so stupid

16
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,870
and I censor myself all time it's not

17
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,190
because I think cursing is bad or it's

18
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,930
gonna hurt someone it's because my

19
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,219
parents and society told me that it's a

20
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,989
bad thing to say and don't get me wrong

21
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,280
I'm not one to swear a lot in real life

22
00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:22,740
maybe we were like almost everyone else

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:24,540
sometimes I can't help you looking at

24
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,310
think about it o is a word which in

25
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,140
reality is just a sound hurting anyone

26
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,850
if it's the meaning then why is it

27
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,520
socially acceptable to say the word hate

28
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,570
when you can't say the word see I hate

29
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,130
that I can't even see that lot of

30
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,810
context you know when you were a little

31
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,490
kid and you went home crying it's not

32
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,020
because somebody said a bad word you

33
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,680
cried because they said I don't want to

34
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,180
play with you anymore you're ugly what

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,409
that didn't happen to you guys and then

36
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,790
when you were your parents and tell them

37
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:49,590
what happened they tell you oh you know

38
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,350
son sticks and stones may break your

39
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,909
bones but words may never hurt you if

40
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,259
our parents taught us so why are we

41
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,750
allowed as kids to play with sticks and

42
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,399
stones but if we tell our dads you dad

43
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,960
and you know what happens next right dad

44
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,969
grabs the sticks and stones and beats

45
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,350
the side of you that didn't happen to

46
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:06,149
you guys either if I ever become a

47
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,670
parent I'm not gonna censor much if my

48
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,420
child questions me dad where do babies

49
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,100
come from

50
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,050
vagina oh I'm

51
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,640
be honest is he hurt from that no if

52
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,980
anything he's now smarter than the kid

53
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,440
that got lied to dad where do babies

54
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:22,910
come from well son when a man loves a

55
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:26,820
woman the stork delivers a baby to you

56
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:31,080
that means I'm adopted apart stork

57
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:32,790
which means I can fly it's not what you

58
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,530
want since you should kill his kids ha

59
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,850
just kidding but serious insertion makes

60
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,680
no sense I'm not just talking about

61
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,510
cursing and swearing all sensors like

62
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,790
why is the movie rated R when it has sex

63
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,260
and cursing in it and the pg-13 when

64
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,370
there's killing and explosions and wise

65
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,450
looking for women to take pictures and

66
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,920
bathing suits but when it comes to

67
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,330
underwear it's in a poke why is it okay

68
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,650
for us to see man boobs but when it

69
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,700
comes to women we have to censor then

70
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,110
what's the difference because one

71
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,370
produces no and the other one doesn't in

72
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,870
that case shouldn't we censor all the

73
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,940
cows they're basically like four legged

74
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,720
boobs walking around eating the grass

75
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,910
huh

76
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,300
sorry house they're just my tipping get

77
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:04,800
it tipping point cows tell Jimmy

78
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,300
anyway I'm not asking for there to be

79
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,800
changes because I don't mind living by

80
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,420
these rules that was just curious to see

81
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,500
if anyone else felt the same way because

82
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,600
this is something that's been bothering

83
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,760
me for a long time and it just feels

84
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,380
good to get off my chest I don't need a

85
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,500
censor I don't have boobs

86
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,500
