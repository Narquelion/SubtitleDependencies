you do first is cleanse your face done

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,760
the next first step is to powder your

19
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,469
entire face unfortunately for me I had

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,629
no powder so I had to walk through the

21
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:53,789
store but fortunately for me I met a guy

22
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:59,100

little bit more pricey than usual but

26

that's the price you pay when you order

27
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,580
top-quality makeup brands like Mac now

28
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:16,159
