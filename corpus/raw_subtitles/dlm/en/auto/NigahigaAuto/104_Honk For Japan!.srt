00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,030
hey guys so a few days ago there was an

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,830
eight point nine earthquake in Japan

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,390
followed by a tsunami which pretty much

4
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,429
destroyed the place and I know I never

5
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,530
make serious videos and the reason for

6
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,450
that is because whenever I do I get all

7
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,179
this hate rain this is not why I

8
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,980
subscribed or this isn't funny it wasn't

9
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,960
supposed to be this is more important

10
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,949
than comedy or YouTube in general I've

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,810
been trying to think of ways to help

12
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,430
support Japan and encourage others to

13
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,140
support as well so what I'm going to be

14
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,050
doing today is I'm gonna go outside for

15
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,869
