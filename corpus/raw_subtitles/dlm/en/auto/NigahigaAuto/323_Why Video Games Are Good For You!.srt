1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,570
hey guys so growing up I was a huge game

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,250
I know I know it's hard to believe being

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,170
that I was a very skinny small nerdy

4
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,059
Asian kid growing up but really I was a

5
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,440
big game I mean every single free second

6
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,750
that I had I was either on a gaming

7
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,250
console or a computer or a Gameboy of

8
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,410
some sort I would say about 50% of my

9
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,090
childhood was me playing video games 25%

10
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,770
was playing sports the other 25% was

11
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,060
making videos and the last remaining 5%

12
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,560
was me neglecting my math homework

13
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,060
don't get me wrong I definitely don't

14
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,590
play as many video games as I used to

15
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:31,980
because you know I'm not a kid anymore

16
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:33,570
I'm a mature adult so anyway if you play

17
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,070
or played as many video games as I did

18
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,420
you've definitely heard this before it's

19
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,010
one of the most irritating things you

20
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,570
could ever hear as a gamer why are you

21
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,440
wasting your time if you know if you

22
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,730
have something like that in your life

23
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,290
get rid of them not because what they

24
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,579
say they're what that voice is so

25
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,379
irritating usually coming from your

26
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,730
parents or girls I'm not trying to be

27
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,170
sexist I know a lot of girls play video

28
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,059
games too but let's be real it's more

29
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,260
guys it's it's a fact although there's a

30
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,760
lot of guys that will question your

31
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,469
video game playing too but I mean those

32
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,910
are just losers that don't play video

33
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:03,000
games because they have no lives right

34
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:04,470
guys there are three main reasons why I

35
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,970
think people say that video games are

36
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,350
always the time one they're not good at

37
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,850
them so they don't like playing that -

38
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,590
they like playing them but they have no

39
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,210
time so they don't want you to either or

40
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,080
the worst of all three they judge you

41
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,490
because you have an interest in

42
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,869
something that they have no interest in

43
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,250
which is so judgmental and makes

44
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:18,479
absolutely no sense to me that's like

45
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,979
saying hey mom why do you paint your

46
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,000
nails that's always a timer hey dad why

47
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,560
do you watch football and that's a waste

48
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,380
of time or hey or no that's a great show

49
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,610
I missed that show feel better now if

50
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,110
you get the point I actually believe

51
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,640
that video games are good for kids or

52
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,960
anyone we do games aren't a waste of

53
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,400
time they're good for you they teach a

54
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,079
life lesson and I think it's about time

55
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,790
that our society starts to appreciate

56
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,979
that for all the gamers the geeks the

57
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,720
Nerds the so-called losers I'm standing

58
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,759
up for you the next time somebody says

59
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,110
gaming is a waste of time like a friend

60
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,700
or a parent or a boyfriend or girlfriend

61
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,740
probably not the last two because you're

62
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,149
a nerd haha I'm gonna stand up for you

63
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,240
and let them know the truth and tell

64
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:53,100
them all the reasons why I'm so close to

65
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,360
the camera I'm out of focus all the

66
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,130
reasons why

67
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,130
gaming is actually good

68
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:03,060
first let me start off with the most

69
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,830
obvious one hand-eye coordination a lot

70
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,210
of video games required quick reflexes

71
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,790
especially first-person shooters like

72
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,590
Conor strong Gears of War halos modern

73
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:12,030
warfare attica I can't think of a better

74
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,230
way to teach hand-eye coordination I

75
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:23,160
mean how else would I be able to do

76
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:24,900
something like this candy too easy ah

77
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,960
problem solved if you don't run into any

78
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,340
difficult and it's just like life if

79
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,650
your life has no problems you're not

80
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,670
really living it that is deep I just

81
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,140
mean that oh that is a straight-up

82
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:37,140
annoying person's caption for their

83
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,820
selfie on Instagram anyway I'm off

84
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,290
talking both videogames and life you're

85
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,940
gonna run into problems a true gamer

86
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,380
never gives up problem solves until he

87
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,180
figures out how to win trial and error

88
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,530
looking for patterns keeping a 10 - he

89
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,880
gets better and better for example in

90
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,140
real life if you're taking a calculus

91
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,610
class at you're failing for you like a

92
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,080
video game try to problem solve never

93
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,310
give up and eventually you will succeed

94
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,630
if you know you're not ready and you

95
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,940
can't beat that level then lower the

96
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,320
difficulty take ceramics camping don't

97
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,760
be a camp for all you gamers out there

98
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,870
you already know in a camper but for

99
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,100
those of you that don't a Kaffir is

100
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,720
basically someone that will wait around

101
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,860
and hide and so their victims come to

102
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,390
them rather than actually playing the

103
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,840
actual game this is such an important

104
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,640
life lesson

105
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,470
yeah sure be a camper and enjoy the safe

106
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,459
route hide behind a bush or a couch your

107
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,870
whole life but if you want to have an

108
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:14,489
exciting life don't just be a camper who

109
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,840
just waits around to opportunity come

110
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:17,580
see it's not just lame to people it's

111
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,200
irritating you get out there and you get

112
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,930
go after what you want in life helping

113
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,310
is boring rice storm the front go go go

114
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,140
counter-strike references hackers

115
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,459
hackers aren't respected sure it give me

116
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,110
a hacker in life and cheat your way to

117
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:29,459
the top you and everyone else around you

118
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,720
knows that you have to get there and the

119
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,800
thing is technology is so good now that

120
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,160
if you're hacking you're gonna get

121
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:38,300
caught dare I say it

122
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,900
and so we'll make her dance bands but

123
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,220
good day

124
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,390
nobody likes a rage quitter you know

125
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:49,850
those guys they quit the game out of

126
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:51,560
frustration go go go settle quit if you

127
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,700
play games especially online you know

128
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,500
the feeling of wanting to rage quit

129
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,030
don't even lie and as irritating as a

130
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,620
rage quit or is it still teaches you a

131
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,940
life lesson sometimes you get so upset

132
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,320
and frustrated that you just have to

133
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,460
stop when you're in a place in life when

134
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,290
you're so unhappy with the way things

135
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,610
are going take a break take some time to

136
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,200
cool off and come back even stronger

137
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:08,420
money management whether it's coins

138
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,590
dollars minerals or whatever video game

139
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,760
seats you want to spend it whines for

140
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,900
example if you're gonna buy a knob you

141
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,220
have to member to save money for ammo

142
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,330
because that was pretty expensive not to

143
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,680
mention your secondary weapon like a

144
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,670
Diigo or something and we'd even get to

145
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,930
the part about the equipment like your

146
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,190
caliper and he'll made your frag grenade

147
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,660
your double flash bangs and/or smoke

148
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,950
grenade and stun damn I really am in

149
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,630
there if you get any of those references

150
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,890
you're awesome micromanage when you have

151
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,870
a bunch of Units you don't just auto

152
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,250
attack like some new you assign

153
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,290
different units to do different things

154
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,910
yet another life lesson each person has

155
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,290
their own specific purpose micromanage

156
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,880
each person to do what they're best at

157
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:36,290
that's efficiency by all and every

158
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,640
first-person shooter will teach you that

159
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,200
you're more likely to die if you get

160
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,790
shot in the head than the arm or the leg

161
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,990
okay maybe that one might seem obvious

162
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,550
but if you think about it it's probably

163
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,470
obvious because you learned that from a

164
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:48,500
video game or a movies Trula if you get

165
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:50,000
shot in the head GG bro multiplayer to

166
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,440
me this is one of the most valuable life

167
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,880
lessons you can learn from video games

168
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,500
most if not all video games these days

169
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,730
are multiple multiplayer teaches you

170
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,900
that if you have a bad team and you

171
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,160
don't work together you're probably

172
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,450
gonna lose you can't always do

173
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,130
everything by yourself the bottom line

174
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,990
is there's no I in the spelling of

175
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:04,850
teamwork just like there's no I in the

176
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,340
spelling of multiplayer with the bottom

177
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:09,080
line there it is and the sooner you

178
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,820
learn that the sooner we can all work

179
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,560
together like a multiplayer unit and

180
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,180
convince people that video games aren't

181
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,620
always the time new games are important

182
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,720
to teaching people how to really start

183
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,220
living life by not setting up camp but

184
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,600
going after the things they really want

185
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,130
without having to cheat their way to the

186
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,660
top even if they have to rage quit every

187
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:25,310
now and then they learn to problem-solve

188
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,780
and never give up until they get there

189
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,310
and once they do they'll already have

190
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,320
past any problems that come along their

191
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,150
