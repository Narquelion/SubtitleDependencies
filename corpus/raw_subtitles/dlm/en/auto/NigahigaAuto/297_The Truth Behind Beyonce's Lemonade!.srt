lemonade it's good for your stomach

52
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,510
really so as you guys know our past

53
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,220
investigations have gone very

54
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,750
successfully as you know figure out the

55
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,400
truth behind Miley Cyrus and of course

56
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,780
proving the Illuminati is real but now

57
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,310
we've been asked to investigate another

58
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,290
mystery mystery of Beyonce's lemonade

59
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,450
album how is that even a mystery it's

60
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,590
just her oh but this album is completely

61
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,030
different see nobody knows what this

62
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,110
album is about there's a lot of

63
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,580
different theory some people believe

64
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,470
that this album is about infidelity and

65
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,300
how jay-z cheated on Beyonce but at the

66
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,680
same time some other people say well if

67
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,180
you really did cheat on her why are they

68
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,560
still together and more importantly why

69
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,420
did she release her songs and title the

70
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,770
platform that jay-z himself owned and

71
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,300
why is it even called lemonades there's

72
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:58,160
no explanation for that some people

73
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,080
believe that okay we get it there's a

74
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,700
bunch of conspiracy theories but this

75
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,410
better not be one of those Illuminati

76
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,730
thing no in fact it's a complete

77
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,110
opposite you see last time we talked

78
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:07,580
about the Illuminati we started with

79
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,049
apples because apples are by far the

80
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,850
most popular fruit they're eaten by

81
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:12,380
children and adults are used in schools

82
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,060
to represent our teachers all of our

83
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,739
technology comes from Apple even the

84
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,330
Bible speaks about apples in the story

85
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:18,890
of Adam and Eve all of a sudden in less

86
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:20,359
than a month nobody's talking about this

87
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:22,250
powerful fruit because there's another

88
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:24,410
fruit on the rise the rival to the app

89
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,460
with a complete opposite oranges like

90
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,320
apples and oranges

91
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,430
no what about bananas like more bananas

92
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,140
than anything see that's what I thought

93
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,760
at first oranges and bananas are way

94
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,590
more popular than lemon so why did

95
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,710
Beyonce choose lemons over all the other

96
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:38,900
fruits mixed to the letters C orange

97
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:42,169
banana six-letter words they don't fit

98
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,700
apple and lemon both fives but there's

99
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:45,229
an even bigger hint that beyond sea

100
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,060
lettuce that proves that there's more to

101
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:49,070
this album than we all thought what she

102
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,320
named it lemonade not lemon so what

103
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,850
that's just juice see but it is it what

104
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,500
you see every other fruit can be made

105
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,419
into a juice but not lemons apples

106
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,430
become apple juice oranges become orange

107
00:04:56,419 --> 00:05:00,979
juice pineapple pineapple juice Kiwi

108
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,990
juice even tomato juice but not lemons

109
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:05,600
lemons become lemonade strange

110
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,860
Chum that is stream okay fine let's say

111
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,330
you're right and there's something more

112
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,979
to it now what we start with the most

113
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,000
famous saying about lemonade when life

114
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:12,740
gives you lemons you make lemonade

115
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,780
that's not the case here is it because

116
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,639
we're being given lemonade not lemons so

117
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:19,430
so Beyonce wants us to work backwards

118
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,020
see Beyonce has crazy following most of

119
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,580
them girls and they're so in love with

120
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,319
her they want to dedicate their lives to

121
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,610
being her followers they're so in love

122
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,860
with her they literally say things like

123
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:29,539
Amaya Beyonce is life and in this

124
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,160
scenario that's absolutely correct see

125
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:32,419
if we work backwards when life gives you

126
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,610
lemons you make lemonade

127
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:36,440
but if Beyonce is lie it should be when

128
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:38,780
Beyonce gives you lemonade you may

129
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,780
lemons exactly but that doesn't make any

130
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,889
sense oh it doesn't not yet one of the

131
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,660
first things that come to mind when you

132
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:46,729
say the word lemon sour I don't know

133
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,500
yellow right sour yo and if we continue

134
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:50,870
to work backwards the phrase we make

135
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,130
lemons becomes lemons make you what the

136
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,940
lemons make you do when you bite into

137
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:57,590
him squint because it's sour exactly and

138
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,590
when you squint you look more like an

139
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:02,300
Asian what dude that's racist

140
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,800
- and you squint you look more like

141
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,080
you're tired because your eyes are

142
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,240
smaller like an Asian yeah of course and

143
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,430
Asians are stereotypically known to be

144
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,349
yellow just like lemon again we continue

145
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,960
to work backwards yellow backwards is

146
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:16,070
Wally Wally like the Disney movie about

147
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,570
the earth coming to an end

148
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,159
see in that movie we think that wall is

149
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,719
the only remaining individual on earth

150
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:22,940
but there's another and coincidentally

151
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:24,289
her name is Eve just like Adam and Eve

152
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,729
who supposedly were the only two

153
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:28,159
individuals on earth as well and since

154
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:28,580
Eve is obviously Eve then Adam must be

155
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:30,020
wall-e

156
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,759
and since wall-e is actually wall-e

157
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:34,310
yellow backwards what they're really

158
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,830
saying is that Adam is yellow yellow

159
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,300
Adam yellow Adam in chemistry you

160
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,979
learned that cpk coloring is used to

161
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,599
distinguish atoms by color and the color

162
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:43,460
yellow is assigned to sulfur and sulfur

163
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:44,990
is an atomic number of 16 and it also

164
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,310
smells like rotten egg however if you

165
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,020
smell rotten eggs and you're not near a

166
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:49,490
volcano chances are is just somebody's

167
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,050
rotten egg farm and since eggs are

168
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,729
measured in dozens coincidentally the

169
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:55,009
same number of songs and Beyonce's album

170
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:56,719
if we take the atomic number of 16 and

171
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:57,889
count out all the songs we come all the

172
00:06:56,719 --> 00:06:59,719
way back to the first song with the

173
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:01,520
remainder of four track four happens to

174
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:03,259
be the song named sorry but who else

175
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,150
just recently had the biggest hit in the

176
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:06,860
world name sorry Justin Bieber who if

177
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:09,470
you didn't know recently just dyed his

178
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,180
hair guess what color that's right yeah

179
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,920
but recently only a week after Beyonce

180
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,450
releases her lemonade album Justin

181
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,830
Bieber Shaye's off his yellow hair he

182
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,180
goes right back to his natural hair

183
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,280
color which is still kind of a off

184
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,900
yellow color which is awfully symbolic

185
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,370
and similar to peeling 11 as you peel

186
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,140
off the yellow outside and the inside is

187
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,850
an off yellow color which means the Pugh

188
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,650
is nothing more than a cover speaking of

189
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:29,210
covers when we see the album cover of

190
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,830
lemonade instantly you see the shape of

191
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,570
the lemon but there is a lot more to it

192
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,800
we work from the bottom up we see fern

193
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,120
if I had to guess what I don't want that

194
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,620
look like I would have to say it looks

195
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,330
like a bear and above that you see an

196
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,560
ear which is strange because if she were

197
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,180
a part of the Illuminati that'd be the

198
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,980
perfect place to put an eye but no this

199
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,440
is something new she put him here and on

200
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:49,430
her ear rings eerie and as we mentioned

201
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,940
before above that the lemon what don't

202
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:54,020
you get it

203
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:57,170
no bears rings lemons Beyonce is bearing

204
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,850
fruit and bearing fruit for a tree means

205
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,170
that it's growing fruits for a person

206
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,970
bearing fruit means that she's growing

207
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:04,040
something else if you peel off the cover

208
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:06,860
what she's really trying to say Yonsei

209
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:10,010
is pregnant see that's what lemonade

210
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,300
it's really about this has got to be one

211
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:13,550
of the dumbest ones you've had so far

212
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,930
there's so many holes in this well I

213
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,340
didn't say I was done yet there's more

214
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,660
yeah I told you guys I needed your help

215
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,070
I still haven't figured out what these

216
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,390
are yeah you really think Beyonce's

217
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,190
pregnant I don't see how feminie could

218
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,330
be about anything else well if she

219
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,100
really is I don't think she should be

220
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:27,470
drinking lemonade look how many carbs

221
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,980
there are 53 grams for one bottle that's

222
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,970
crazy

223
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:33,289
didn't eat three grams for three crab oh

224
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:35,750
my god

225
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:38,599
it's numbers what

226
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:42,199
53 grams you said you said there 53 in

227
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:44,329
there yeah 52 grams 83 grams 53 Grammys

228
00:08:42,199 --> 00:08:47,870
huh Beyonce has the record for the most

229
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:49,550
Grammy nominations 53 of them way there

230
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,800
you go again connecting two completely

231
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:54,079
unrelated things it's 53 grams of

232
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,490
carbohydrates not granny exactly that's

233
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:58,339
was leading us to the next part if we

234
00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:00,980
break it up it's just car bull hydrate

235
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:02,480
when you hear car bowl a bowl the size

236
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,310
of a car that's a really big bowl

237
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,720
hydrate has to do with liquids but if

238
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:08,589
we're talking about a bowl what kind of

239
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:12,589
liquids do you put in a bowl lemonade

240
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:14,870
but no it's soup oh now you have a

241
00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:18,110
really big bowl of soup no a huge bowl

242
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:20,000
of soup a Super Bowl the Super Bowl

243
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,129
Beyonce was a halftime show performer

244
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,329
for to love him Super Bowl xlvii and 50

245
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:25,100
but she wasn't even really a made

246
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:26,420
performer in Super Bowl 50 she was just

247
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,040
in it there's kind of a big difference

248
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,420
oh there's a difference alright but

249
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,269
ain't that big what the difference

250
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:35,329
between Super Bowl 50 and 47 is 3 and 3

251
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:37,730
is our magic number one might say how so

252
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:39,980
beyond just 34 Jay Z's 46 when we add

253
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,420
their ages together we have 80 okay we

254
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,059
take our magic number three and subtract

255
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:47,170
bottom 80 we're left with 77 and 77 as

256
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:49,639
we all know is the product of 7 times 11

257
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:51,589
7-eleven 7-eleven the hit song that

258
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:53,269
Beyonce released three years ago but if

259
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:54,949
she planned this three years ago why now

260
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:57,379
he's on the anniversary of seven lemons

261
00:09:54,949 --> 00:10:01,040
released this year Beyonce be 35 in 77

262
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:03,110
minus 35 at 42 the exact age jay-z was

263
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,120
when his daughter Blue Ivy was born 42

264
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,100
what what does their daughter even have

265
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,600
anything to do with 7-eleven was made

266
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,160
for their daughter come on if you really

267
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,009
listen to the lyrics wave your hands

268
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,620
side to side clap clap clap clap it my

269
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:17,120
hands up my hands up I stand up with my

270
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,649
hands up it does sound like a children's

271
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,449
song exactly because 7-eleven was

272
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:21,529
disguised to be for us but really it was

273
00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:23,449
just for their daughter that's why the

274
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:24,709
lyrics are so bad of course since this

275
00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:26,149
song is made for their daughter don't

276
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:28,430
tell me it's a coincidence at their

277
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:30,690
daughters 4 years old yet in seven years

278
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:33,630
she's going to be what

279
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:36,000
it isn't eleven the exact number of

280
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:38,010
songs that's on her album no you said it

281
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,140
yourself there's twelve songs precisely

282
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:42,180
see there's twelve songs but we got

283
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:45,870
eleven we were almost there we were this

284
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:46,650
close we were an inch away six inches to

285
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,300
be exact

286
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:50,820
the only number in any of her titles and

287
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:53,580
it's six the number six on her sixth

288
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,020
album six is our special number one

289
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,850
might say but I thought you said three

290
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,590
was our special number but no three is

291
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,330
our magic number because it's half of

292
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,860
six you see if we take it from where we

293
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:03,810
left off at eleven and we multiply it by

294
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:09,390
our special number of six we end up with

295
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:11,730
our final number 66 fifty-three 342 11

296
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:13,200
66 but but what do they mean I don't

297
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:14,580
know but it has to mean something if not

298
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,770
Beyonce when animated that obvious

299
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:18,420
obvious nothing about any of this is

300
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:20,070
zombie what are you talking about it was

301
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,870
so clear literally forcing these

302
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:23,580
connections they make no sense at all it

303
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:25,560
makes it what's even worse is you ended

304
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,820
up with nothing nothing what we have the

305
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,560
last piece those are the last five

306
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:33,030
number five hours I mean nothing

307
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:35,100
oh my god seriously it's a bad one sorry

308
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,660
I told you I wasn't feeling well dude

309
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:40,920
what the heck did you eat it smells like

310
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:43,290
rotten egg that's him huh rotten eggs

311
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:46,910
sulfur they're elements although

312
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:52,460
fifty-three 342 1166 the atomic numbers

313
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:55,650
three is lithium iodide lithium

314
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:57,480
molybdenum sodium dysprosium it's a

315
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:59,880
formula it all makes sense now

316
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,250
what does everything why Beyonce made an

317
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,200
entire album bashing her husband a man

318
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:06,180
why the majority of Beyonce's songs are

319
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,830
all about and for women even why there's

320
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,250
an ear on the album cover instead of an

321
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:12,280
eye Yonsei his giving

322
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:15,060
but to an idea no I group no one army

323
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:18,640
women to take over the world

324
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:21,010
what it's all starting is that formula

325
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,380
Shawn check that lemonade bottle head

326
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:25,360
dine the film but Minneapolis it's all

327
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,590
here see the see it's already begun but

328
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,690
we've been drinking this lemonade

329
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:30,220
exactly look at us we're fine yeah for

330
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,440
now who knows what's gonna happen later

331
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,060
look this is so stupid how do you even

332
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,710
come up with these ridiculous conspiracy

333
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,420
theories I really have to spell this out

334
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,860
for you look at the abbreviations see

335
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,510
this is not about the Illuminati the

336
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,250
Illuminati's around by men see Beyonce

337
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,750
starting something new she's giving

338
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,850
birth to a new group of powerful women

339
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:48,220
to not just take over the world the

340
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:49,450
previous Illuminati as well think about

341
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,550
it think about everything you've ever

342
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:53,830
heard from Beyonce she wants who to run

343
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:57,130
the world girls she wants although what

344
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:59,820
single ladies every single lady to rise

345
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:02,380
up in formation to go to flawless

346
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:05,500
irreplaceable army of grown women to

347
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:11,860
create the new Illuminati the lady

348
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:16,210
the 1180s I have that or she's just

349
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:17,800
pregnant look 10 minutes later we're all

350
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:21,490
drinking lemonade and we're still fine

351
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:23,710
but are we though oh wait how come my

352
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:27,090
name change oh that's right it wasn't a

353
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:27,090
cup I peed in a bottle
