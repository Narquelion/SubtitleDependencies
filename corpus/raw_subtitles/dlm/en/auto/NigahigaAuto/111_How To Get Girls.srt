5
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,460

you're single and all your friends are

12
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,779
in a relationship just makes you want

13
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,550
one even more even if it's unintentional

14
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:24,750
everytime you see them together it kind

15
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:31,880
of feel like they're just rubbing it in

16
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:31,880

out there you know what I mean right I

23
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,930
realize that part of the reason why I'm

24
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,190
single is because I have no game

25
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,600
whatsoever and also I spend pretty much

26
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:58,090
all my time in my room by myself alone

27
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,530
making videos could be part of the

28
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,820
reason why and again I know a lot of you

29
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,890
guys are the same and I took it upon

30
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,950
myself I made it a mission after years

31
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:08,590

in order to get girls are the three C's

00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,710
cool courage confidence when I see a

46
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:37,600
pretty girl I turn into a complete loser

47
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:43,149
I don't turn into a loser Mike my inner

48
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:44,890
loser comes out that's where the first

49
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:51,910
seat comes in cool you have to play it

50
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:53,080
cool don't freak out ii see courage one

51
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,429
of the hardest steps when you see a

52
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,810
pretty girl is to go over an approach

53
00:01:54,429 --> 00:02:04,660
her and i'm not gonna lie i used to

54
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:06,009
chicken out a lot but this is when

55
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,270
courage comes in don't make her away

56
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:10,679
just need to instantly build up the

57
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,679
courage and just walk right up to her

58
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,569
and once you got those two down all you

59
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,280
need is a third seat

60
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:18,739
confidence don't ever show that you're

61
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,830
nervous never show weakness yeah yeah

62
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:25,670

00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:27,140
here and say that right just be

64
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:31,280
confident when you're confident anything

65
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:32,930
you say will work so be alright so maybe

66
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,680
you can't say anything in fact here's a

67
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,840
list of things that you should probably

68
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,280
never say because they don't work trust

69
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,849
me

70
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:43,819

00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,349
this is amazing I could not ask for a

74
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:53,660
better situation do you think you would

75
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:55,819
like to maybe introduce me to your

76
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,200
friend I don't know I thought they'd

77
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:58,940
think it was funny so now you guys got

78
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,010
the three C's down all that's left is

79
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:05,269
what you have to say tell me what that

80
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:06,620
was there are a lot of different girls

81
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:08,000
in this one that's why I created pickup

82
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,760
lines for every single type of girl such

83
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,989
as hot girl pickup lines for hot girls

84
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,670
guys are always trying to come up with

85
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:15,140
newer smarter pickup lines so it's

86
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,400
actually more original to a hot girl to

87
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,840
give her a lame and obvious one key

88
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,760
point just be different if other guys

89
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,019

feet I said earlier 12 inches which we

blind sometimes there's gonna be a

149
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,790
language barrier you just have to adapt

150
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,810
do you like the anime one piece you

151
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,860

I speak English you anime one piece hey

153
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,910
Justin Bieber fan pick-up line did you

154
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,470

love Mike

157
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,360
chances are she's underage walk away oh

158
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,560
really cheesy pickup lines these are

159
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,700
specifically meant for girls who think

160
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,930
that pickup lines are cheese I don't

161
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,790
know they don't even know what cheesy

162
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,230
means yet look I know this might seem a

163
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,670
little out of the blue and I know you're

164
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:49,230
probably fed up with a bunch of guys

165
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:51,900
coming up to you so I'll keep this brief

166
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:53,490
I think it would be a good idea if we

167
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,380
were to prom around together unless of

168
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,150
course you prefer to provolone oh my

169
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:06,150
gosh you're the cutest man a picture

170
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:07,590
with you have my parmesan and some girls

171
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,310
just hate pickup lines in general

172
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,810
because they hate when guys are

173
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,040
predictable and give them the same old

174
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,480
thing these pickup lines are a little

175
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,590
less predictable and they kind of do the

176
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,030
opposite um

177
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:17,730
did it hurt what when I fell from heaven

178
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:18,930
