1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
hey guys so I play basketball at a

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:05,130
public park a lot and I was kind of

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,049
inspired to make this video and there's

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,760
not just ages at this part there's every

5
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:10,440
ethnicity that goes there black white

6
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,849
Indian Hispanic pretty much every single

7
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,559
race you can think of have you've ever

8
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:15,120
been to a public basketball park you

9
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,920
know exactly what I'm talking about when

10
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,480
I say there's a lot of racist jokes that

11
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,070
goes on there and for some reason most

12
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,390
of them are targeted towards the Asian

13
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,949
for example when we're picking teams

14
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,320
they'll point at me and say give me

15
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,580
Jeremy Lin over there and obviously I

16
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,840
don't look like him it's just the fact

17
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,130
that I'm playing basketball and I'm

18
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,480
Asian and there's two ways that I could

19
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,460
easily take that I could add their act

20
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,320
really offended and say damn bro that's

21
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,340
racist or I could just make a joke out

22
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,930
of it and make it seem like it's not a

23
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,670
big deal which is what I usually do and

24
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,050
it works or another example I would have

25
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,610
passed the bond got stolen out wouldn't

26
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,700
be surprised if one of my teammates said

27
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,170
hey come on you gotta open your eyes bro

28
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,460
because Asians have small eyes right or

29
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,140
even if they were to pass the ball and

30
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,820
got stolen by another Asian on the other

31
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,440
team they would say something like oh my

32
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,110
bad I thought you were the Jeremy Lin on

33
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,129
my team what you agents look alike

34
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,899
because we all look exactly the same

35
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:59,699
right or even sometimes when they ask me

36
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,199
the score so Jeremy Lin what's the score

37
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,550
and I'd be like she's not sure but I

38
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,710
thought all you Asians were supposed to

39
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,380
be good at math well no but actually I

40
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,240
think the score is seven 200 or what

41
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,710
nothing that's the score Oh Oh to seven

42
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,150
well you mean it so to seven no no it's

43
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,330
all to seven two O's what

44
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,549
double-oh-seven sad part is I actually

45
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,720
said that joke at the park once and the

46
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:20,640
reaction is probably the same as you

47
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,020
guys you know nobody nobody laughed

48
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,640
anyway this is probably another

49
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,990
unpopular opinion that I should keep to

50
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,340
myself but I'm not going to I'm just

51
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,840
gonna be completely honest with you guys

52
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,280
I personally do not get offended by

53
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,960
Asian stereotypes anymore because if you

54
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,310
really think about it stereotypes not

55
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,750
just ages stereotypes but all

56
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,610
stereotypes from other ethnicities are

57
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,170
somewhat based off of true and rather

58
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,640
than getting offended by them and trying

59
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,930
to deny it I think it's a lot better if

60
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,369
you were to accept the stereotype so

61
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,930
that we can break through them instead

62
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:44,520
now before all my fellow Asian people

63
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,780
attacked me for this opinion just think

64
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,909
about it I know that most Asian

65
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,540
stereotypes aren't hugely

66
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:50,340
over-exaggerated and they definitely

67
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,110
don't apply to everyone but in general

68
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,670
stereotypes come from some truth and

69
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,320
that's why they should be offensive to

70
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,759
you like for example when I say Asian

71
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,869
stereotypes I know one of the first

72
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,149
things that come to mind when you look

73
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:01,950
at me is that oh he's Asian and we all

74
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,880
know the stereotype for Asians is that

75
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:07,680
he has a little well Sony or Yamaha or

76
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,119
some other kind of type of Asian stereo

77
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,580
and you're absolutely right I have a

78
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,890
little Sony stereo right

79
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,000
my point is some of my fellow agents out

80
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,860
there I used to be one of those people

81
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,210
that got insulted by Asian stereotypes

82
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,530
and I used to deny that they weren't

83
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,830
true but the thing is that's never gonna

84
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,240
work

85
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,680
Asian stereotypes aren't going anywhere

86
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,150
because they are based off of true

87
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,220
rather than being offending and trying

88
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,660
to deny stereotypes I say just own it

89
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,370
and poopy belong don't give them the

90
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,720
satisfaction of being insulted for

91
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,430
example one of the most common Asian

92
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,990
stereotypes is that all Asians have

93
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,340
squinty eyes obviously it's an

94
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:36,620
exaggeration and it doesn't apply to

95
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,600
every Asian but statistically it's true

96
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,190
agents have smaller eyes it's not even

97
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,510
an insult to me in fact it's better to

98
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,650
have small eyes we can get away with

99
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,970
falling asleep in class and if a

100
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,440
professor or teacher were to tell us to

101
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,810
wake up and open our eyes we can say

102
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,850
well that's kind of racist sir okay that

103
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,800
was kind of an insult but I'm Asian so I

104
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,300
can another common Asian stereotype is

105
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,590
that all Asians are good at math now I

106
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,210
don't even know why Asian people get

107
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,590
offended by this one it's a compliment

108
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:59,270
and again I know the stereotype doesn't

109
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,440
apply to everyone I mean I can name five

110
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,300
Asians off the top of my head that

111
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,160
aren't good at math Sean and Greg Derek

112
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,230
me but for the most part it's true

113
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,700
cystic aliy most Asians around the world

114
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,750
are good at math I think you guys pretty

115
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,850
much get the point but I'm gonna name a

116
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,470
few more Asians have poor English yeah a

117
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,730
lot of Asians - but for those people

118
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,020
it's because English is their second

119
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,280
language in English for their first

120
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,630
language they would sound just like me

121
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,000
and I'm good are their foes not Asian

122
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,890
people my English is that is all Asians

123
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,690
are bad in sports so all Asians are bad

124
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:25,489
if sports try saying that the jeremy lin

125
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,560
he's so good at dota you don't even know

126
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:29,270
Asians only eat rice okay this one is a

127
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,250
little racist because it's not true at

128
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:32,959
all we also eat the noodle all Asians

129
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,880
know martial arts no not all Asians know

130
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,470
martial arts but most martial arts are

131
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,090
from Asia even if that's not true for

132
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,110
everyone why wouldn't you want people to

133
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,540
know that that's cool

134
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:42,709
kung fu kata take kendo judo Aikido I

135
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,840
can understand why that's a stereotype

136
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:46,310
Asians have bad teeth okay this one is

137
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,630
an insult because teeth are supposedly

138
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,650
beauty and basically you're saying in

139
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,239
Asians are bad teeth they're not

140
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,920
beautiful I mean but let's be real for a

141
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,810
second you can't really get offended by

142
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,280
this about 50% of all the Asian kids I

143
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,200
knew had braces the other half were

144
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,970
either really lucky or they still do

145
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,260
need braces again don't get offended by

146
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:02,000
it just own it yeah I got messed-up

147
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,590
teeth but I can get braces what you

148
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,970
gonna do about your face okay you don't

149
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:07,310
want to say that but that was just an

150
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,600
example all Asians are Chinese know just

151
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,040
because somebody's Asian it doesn't mean

152
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,560
they're Chinese that's like assuming all

153
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,730
white people are Irish or German or some

154
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,989
other type of white and just for the

155
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,730
record because I know this is gonna come

156
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:18,380
up in the comments I'm Japanese which is

157
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,410
completely different from Chinese like

158
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,510
Jeremy Lin he's trying

159
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,010
do I look anything like that no I'm Way

160
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,660
buffer than he is that's another

161
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,880
stereotype Asians aren't both look at

162
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,440
this huh you see that mountain right

163
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,820
there you see these guns you can't make

164
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,170
fun of you who make fun of yourself I

165
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,640
made a joke about it earlier but one of

166
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,620
the most common stereotypes that people

167
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,800
use as an insult is that Asians have

168
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,090
small well wieners at least for me I'm

169
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,740
not afraid to admit it I got a mini

170
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,090
wiener right here his name is Marley and

171
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,380
he's my miniature wiener dog who's

172
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,550
actually been sitting on my lap this

173
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,200
whole time right next to my little

174
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,460
sausage I believe they're called Smokies

175
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,630
not sure why they're called that

176
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,800
probably cuz they're so small and you

177
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,030
have to hold it like a cigarette not

178
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,800
that I would know how to hold a

179
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,660
cigarette I don't smoke but that is how

180
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,920
I hold my little penis penis isn't dick

181
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,960
you know my little dick dick isn't

182
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,430
Richard Richard is in Richard marks one

183
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,780
of my favorite pianists of all time he's

184
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,860
such an inspiration I always keep a

185
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,690
picture of him right in my left pocket

186
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,340
next to my vagina and last but not least

187
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,630
regions can't drive this is one of the

188
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,950
few stereotypes that I have no idea

189
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,540
where they came from it's not

190
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,220
statistically true personally I'm not a

191
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,900
bad driver I only got into like three

192
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,430
accidents so far and got pulled over

193
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,020
maybe like three or four times for

194
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,550
speeding and running a red light stop

195
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,840
signs you know the common things that

196
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,160
everybody gets oh and of course the

197
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,690
really common driving mistake that

198
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,070
everyone does you know when you put your

199
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,330
armor on the passenger seat to help you

200
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,590
look back cuz you're gonna reverse and

201
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,910
then when you press the gas you realize

202
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,530
you're still in Drive so you have

203
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,060
forward so again I don't know where that

204
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,590
stereotype comes from because it happens

205
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,420
to everybody because even in basketball

206
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,800
attorney Asians are great at drive the

207
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,419

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,950
