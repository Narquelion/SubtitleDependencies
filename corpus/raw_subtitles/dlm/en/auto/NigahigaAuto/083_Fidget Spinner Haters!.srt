00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,730
it's kind of fat kind of fast okay yeah

22
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,110
like most people in my age if you're in

23
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,059
your twenties you probably took one look

24
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,530
at this trend and says is so stupid why

25
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:56,760
would anybody waste their money on this

26
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,960
well it does is spin and to be

27
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,820
completely honest this video was

28
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,829
originally gonna be me making fun and

29
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,969
bashing these things and people that

30
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:04,049
play with them you know kind of like

31
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:05,939
what everybody else is doing right now

32
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,250
but after seeing all the hate for this

33
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:11,840
little harmless somewhat useless toy I

34
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,840
just had like this epiphany

35
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:18,400
it wasn't like this it I don't know what

36
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,990
I'm doing we are a society that just

37
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,580
hates the generation below we hate

38
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,810
everything that they do all the trends

39
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,580
they start because we think that our

40
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:26,470
generation is the best and the smartest

41
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,880
and upcoming generations are only

42
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,830
getting worse and worse I'm not just

43
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,390
singling out our generation this is an

44
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,860
ongoing pattern that has been happening

45
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,330
forever I mean think about it when we

46
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,070
are growing up the generation above us

47
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:39,039
complained about us in the same way when

48
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:42,039
we were kids Sam you kid the rap music

49
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:44,409
game boys and polka man back in my day

50
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:47,440
we used to play stickball outside and

51
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:48,880
listen to the classics like dirty if

52
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,830
you're around my age I'm pretty positive

53
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,300
that somebody older than you has said

54
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,679
the exact same thing to you before and

55
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,360
yes it was annoying because they just

56
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:57,580
didn't understand because they're old

57
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,330
they were just being haters well take a

58
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,310
look in the mirror

59
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:02,080
that's us now we're the old haters our

60
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,909
generation is literally doing the same

61
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,520
thing now damn you kids in your

62
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:08,649
hoverboards and babes and lil yachty is

63
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,890
back in my day we used to ride bicycles

64
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:15,100
it had beyblade and we listened to real

65
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:17,380
music like Eminem Britney Spears and the

66
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,989
Backstreet Boys yeah I don't know why

67
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:22,450
our generation sounds sold we're still

68
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:24,640
in our 20s but you get the point you see

69
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,260
it's an ongoing cycle of hate and it all

70
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,640
stems from our arrogant we think that

71
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,530
growing up we had the best childhood

72
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,579
because of how proud we are of ourselves

73
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,739
you believe that the younger generation

74
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:34,150
has to have a childhood like ours if

75
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:35,950
they want to be as successful and

76
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,510
knowledgeable and hardworking as we are

77
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,190
that's why when older generations see

78
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,989
kids doing trends like this you always

79
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,579
see them say things like oh our future

80
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:45,280
is doomed or I'm losing faith in

81
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:47,140
humanity or something else negative and

82
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,269
no I'm not making a video just to defend

83
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,459
these things I agree that these toys are

84
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:53,049
you know kind of useless and not really

85
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:53,829
worth the money but that's exactly the

86
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:55,450
point their toys

87
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:57,459
just because we're older now and way too

88
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,720
mature to play with these things doesn't

89
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:00,340
mean we gotta hate it I mean you think

90
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,290
this is stupid think about the toys we

91
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,120
grew up with we had pogs okay we

92
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,250
collected and play with little circular

93
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,049
pieces of cardboard that with pictures

94
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,730
on them that we would slam on the ground

95
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:11,019
to try and flip over other little

96
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,280
circular pieces of cardboard with

97
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:13,810
pictures on them and that was fun well

98
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,459
what about trading cards our generation

99
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,680
loved trading cards some of us still do

100
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:18,790
from Pokemon cars to ukyo to Magic the

101
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,230
Gathering and like reading card for a

102
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,430
huge and we were growing up and they

103
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,169
were expensive that's right we paid a

104
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,810
bunch of money for a bunch of pieces of

105
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,220
paper with

106
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,599
is on there wasn't even cardboard and

107
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,340
yes I understand these were games you

108
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:29,569
could play them and these these you

109
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,950
can't play games with these they just

110
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:32,480
spin right well then maybe who can

111
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:34,160
explain chattering remember those that's

112
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,480
right kids we had chattering for a short

113
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,190
amount of time chatter means were just

114
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,599
as popular as these in the world when we

115
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:40,220
were growing up and literally all it was

116
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:42,560
was a bunch of little rings that you

117
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,550
would spin onto a bigger ring and keep

118
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,080
spinning the bigger ring so that

119
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,519
littering keeps spinning and make a

120
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,080
bunch of noise with them yeah that

121
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:49,730
didn't sound stupid back then I do

122
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,260
remember some adults saying that was

123
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,940
stupid back then and I laughed at that

124
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,470
they laughed at me that's how it went

125
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,790
they did I didn't laugh at them still

126
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:57,319
not enough you also play with yo-yos

127
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,940
which is a wheel and that's attached to

128
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:00,620
a string that you wind up and then

129
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,150
unravel really fast so that the wheel

130
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,860
spin it's a little younger than my

131
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,569
generation but we also had beyblades

132
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,519
there were little toy tops that you

133
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:09,470
would spin to hit other tops I was like

134
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,120
taking two of these spinning them and

135
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,870
then hitting each other with them oh

136
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,450
great

137
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:16,760
look at that came off whoops we had gak

138
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:19,340
it was literally just goo that you could

139
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,500
touch I don't know we had slinkys a

140
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:23,389
spring-like toy that you would place at

141
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,669
the top of the stairs and then watch it

142
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:27,650
go down those stairs this is starting to

143
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:29,539
sound even worse con depressed we even

144
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,979
had whatever how this thing is I don't

145
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:32,630
think anyone even knew what these things

146
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:34,580
were even supposed to be but a lot of us

147
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,260
had them like this soft slippery sausage

148
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,760
licking thing but it had like an inside

149
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:40,190
so you could like put your finger in it

150
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:43,160
or hold it and like kind of move it

151
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,300
around and wait a second you see

152
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,919
what I mean I'm not saying that these

153
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,180
things aren't stupid okay because they

154
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,340
are why are we eating in the younger

155
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,440
generation when we are just as stupid as

156
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,090
they or maybe even stupider okay we had

157
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,470
this thing it doesn't make sense we're

158
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:56,539
hypocrites oh I'm sorry if you thought

159
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,919
this video was gonna be what most people

160
00:04:56,539 --> 00:05:00,650
are doing which is hating on fidget

161
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,110
spinners fact I am gonna do the opposite

162
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:04,669
and show you how awesome and useful

163
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,380
these things are okay I can name like

164
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:08,360
hundreds of uses off the top of my hand

165
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:11,930
like you can spin them forwards you can

166
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:14,450
spin them spin the backwards kind of you

167
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:18,530
can use it like a ninja star in case

168
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:20,690
it's a burglar in your house it could be

169
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,430
the propeller of a mini helicopter maybe

170
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,440
even a blender if you're blending like

171
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:26,240
really soft easy to blend things you can

172
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,430
use it to draw the perfect circle the

173
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,200
perfect flower brush your teeth faster

174
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,970
get some spinners on your rims you don't

175
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,620
look like a baller or like a ceiling

176
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:36,050
and for really tiny people a lazy susan

177
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:39,680
for really lazy people test your

178
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:41,120
eyesight one or two pretty much the same

179
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,770
could use it as a magnet you could use a

180
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,150
strobe light you could even use it to

181
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,680
explain to your mom what your gauge

182
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,600
years are gonna look lysee

183
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,670
there are hundreds and hundreds of

184
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,350
different use okay yeah there's not a

185
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:52,010
lot you can do with come on it cost like

186
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,160
ten dollars

187
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:56,510
what can you even do with ten dollars

188
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,540
and what would you rather have a ten

189
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:07,280
dollar bill or one of these see that you

190
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:08,630
can't spin a ten dollar bill yeah we

191
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,420
also had a game like this growing up

192
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:13,190
kids it was kind of frowned upon over

193
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,660
all I'm trying to say is all this hate

194
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,820
that we show to other generations

195
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:19,610
especially the younger generations are

196
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:21,470
so unnecessary and kinda hypocritical or

197
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,360
so quick to judge others especially

198
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,980
younger people because we think we know

199
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,450
better and we expect them to grow up the

200
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,430
way we grew up but the thing is Humanity

201
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,900
is constantly evolving and just because

202
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,600
things are different whether it's music

203
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,740
or toys or trends it doesn't mean that

204
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,270
they're wrong we didn't grow up the way

205
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,380
our parents grew up our parents didn't

206
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,090
grow up the way their parents grew up

207
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,680
and kids today aren't gonna grow up the

208
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:42,620
way that we did let's just keep doing us

209
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,590
and let them do them some of us will

210
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:47,090
also keep doing them that doesn't sound

211
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,260

215
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,830
