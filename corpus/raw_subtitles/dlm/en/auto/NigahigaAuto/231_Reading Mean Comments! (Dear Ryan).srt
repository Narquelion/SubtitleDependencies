9
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:19,080
in my eyes I don't know if you guys can

10
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,640

14
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,810
the shape of a ring a bunch of other

15
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,039
youtubers use the same exact thing if

16
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,779
you ever look in someone's eyes and you

17
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,430
see a ring they're using a ring or we're

18
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:34,140
all possessed by the devil the devil of

19
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,850
circles rings I don't think that's a

20
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,440
demonic thing or we're all possessed by

21
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,550
ringworms that's gross and itchy I

22
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,899

23
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,070

34
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,039
get on a hoverboard but friends as in

35
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,449
plural as in multiple friends I'm not

36
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,070
too sure I wonder what the record is

37
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:06,780
there's got to be a thing already record

38
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,610

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,950
memory I want to see you try it for

49
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,570
those of you who didn't see that video

50
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,970
that dear Ryan challenged me to turn

51
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:13,290
Disney's frozen let it go song into a

52
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,550
rap song and people actually thought it

53
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,080
was kind of good some reason even though

54
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,820
I just made it on Garageband in like 10

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,200
second not 10 seconds and took me like

56
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,640
couple hours I'm assuming people think I

57
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,930
can do and I haven't listened to the

58
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,820
song since oh I'm gonna listen to it

59
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,110
