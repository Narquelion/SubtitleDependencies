1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
hey guys so this video is something that

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:08,519
I never thought I would actually do

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,990
clickbait I'm not quitting YouTube well

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,610
I didn't actually say that I was gonna

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,410
quit but you know having the words quit

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,610
and YouTube in the title it kind of you

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,379
know it's kind of quick beat but it's

8
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,910
not I promise and at the same time it's

9
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,800
still not completely untrue let me

10
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:28,910
explain the truth is guys over the past

11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:31,470
year or so i am i sorry it's just um

12
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,719
it's just really hard for me to gather

13
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,760
my thoughts when there's loud cheesy

14
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:45,539
emotional music just playing right in my

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:46,860
ear as it was saying I already told you

16
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,989
guys I'm not quitting but there are

17
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,430
gonna be a lot of changes and let me

18
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:52,050
just let me just start for the top so

19
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,480
that I can explain over the past year I

20
00:00:52,050 --> 00:01:03,300
really have been considering quitting

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:05,159
YouTube see this is why I can't have a

22
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,990
serious heart-to-heart talk with you

23
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,119
guys because I keep cutting away from

24
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,619
random things it's my own fault and him

25
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,240
trying to make this all sad it's not

26
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,710
saying look guys all jokes aside let me

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,600
just be real for a sec it's not that I

28
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,970
don't want to do YouTube and I trust me

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,310
I do realize how great of an opportunity

30
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,380
it has been for me and and still is but

31
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,549
I just wasn't having fun making YouTube

32
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,110
videos anymore and I know it's a

33
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:26,880
first-world problem okay I'm not having

34
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,080
fun in my job I'm not everybody's

35
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,610
supposed to have fun at their job but in

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,259
order to create really good content and

37
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,850
unique things you have to have fun doing

38
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,140
it at least that's what I believe in not

39
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,369
a machine like other youtubers I need

40
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,990
inspiration I mean that's one of the

41
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,000
reasons why I hardly posted last year

42
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,310
and it took me pretty much the entire

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,170
year to realize why I found myself

44
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,119
falling into the typical youtuber trap

45
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,369
of trying to create videos that work

46
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,619
versus trying to create videos that well

47
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:51,060
you're inspired to make things that you

48
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,829
want to even if that means creating

49
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,570
videos that I know for a fact that a lot

50
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:56,850
of you guys probably not like or

51
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,020
understand are most likely be offensive

52
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,460
the kind of videos I used to make when I

53
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,280
first started to you know when I wasn't

54
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,380
afraid of disappointing people or being

55
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,850
too offensive or getting less views or

56
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,259
whatever I just finally realized at the

57
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,940
in the last year that I was forcing

58
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,709
myself to create videos that I don't

59
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,420
even feel like me

60
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:13,040
and I was holding back so many different

61
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,540
things that I really wanted to make I

62
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,799
just was too afraid to do it by the way

63
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm not talking about all the videos

64
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:18,500
last year in fact towards the end of

65
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,510
last year I started posting some of the

66
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,430
videos that I wanted to post n I felt

67
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:24,650
the consequences I mean I saw the views

68
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,269
drop the dislikes go up but honestly I

69
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,799
feel better because I it's something

70
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:28,879
I've been wanting to say I'm sure you

71
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:29,930
can figure out which videos I'm talking

72
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,310
about but anyway once I made the

73
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,209
realization that I wasn't having fun

74
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,400
anymore

75
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:36,170
towards the end of last year I knew that

76
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,730
I had to do something about it and make

77
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,319
a decision either I need to just do

78
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,540
something else and quit youtube entirely

79
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:43,400
or I need to make changes and make

80
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,870
YouTube fun for me again and just start

81
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,250
posting you know whatever the hell I

82
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,169
want to post and do the shows that I

83
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,400
want to do despite all the negative

84
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:51,260
consequences that come with it the

85
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,659
dislikes and the bad comments and you

86
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,250
know you losing subs whatever it is just

87
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:56,750
I just have to do those things because

88
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,950
that's the whole reason why I started

89
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,989
YouTube in the first place all I had to

90
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:01,010
do was stop caring stop caring about the

91
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:03,139
things that don't matter stop being

92
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,969
afraid of failure and take chances and

93
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:06,109
try new things things that I would have

94
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:07,700
never done you know in the previous

95
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:09,260
years but if that's what it takes to

96
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,329
allow me to continue to do this and and

97
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,639
have fun doing it then then I'm just

98
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:16,669
gonna do it that's what I decided until

99
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:18,590
I realize just how much easier it would

100
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:20,000
be to just quit YouTube entirely and

101
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:24,500
just do something else so I went with

102
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,819
that so over the holidays I really

103
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,349
thought about if I were to quit YouTube

104
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:28,579
I can't just do nothing I had to think

105
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:29,870
what else could I possibly do and

106
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:31,579
obviously my first instinct was to do

107
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,379
something similar to what I already do

108
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:35,479
entertainment I always wanted to be an

109
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,979
actor and right now specifically for

110
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:38,569
Asians it's a great time to be an actor

111
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:40,370
the whole Asian movie going on you know

112
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:42,379
spring diversity and one now Asian

113
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,479
actors are kind of a hot commodity right

114
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:47,150
now trust me I know what Hollywood's

115
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,680

American character who was born and

raised in Georgia I'm so sorry I just

129
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,600
assumed because this is Hollywood and I

130
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,890
saw Asian written the character

131
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,450
Elizabeth that's okay

132
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,520

just give me notes or anything to find

139
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,540
one more time on the top and just lose

140
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,430
the accent but the character it says he

141
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,320
has a slight accent a southern one

142
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:54,260
because he's born and raised in Georgia

143
00:04:51,320 --> 00:05:00,500

152
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:22,870
thought about some other jobs that are

153
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,040
not entertainment related I mean I've

154
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,410
never been opposed to a regular

155
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,790
nine-to-five job or a part time job I

156
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,020
probably won't initially get the best

157
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,400
job because I dropped out of college so

158
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,830

00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:38,669

before I dropped out but the thing is

184
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:39,190
I'm a different person now okay a whole

00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:40,570
decade has passed since I've been in

186
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,919
college with all the knowledge that I

187
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,660
gained over the years here on YouTube

188
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,950
this time around college is gonna be

189
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:51,250
like nothing hey you um you wanted to

190
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:53,410

it off with hey guys yes I know it is

193
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:01,479
it's a little rough in the beginning but

194
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,400
it builds it's a pillar essay and it

195
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:05,440
gets better like by the conclusion it's

196
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,060
pretty strong with that being said thank

they are coming

201
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,289
you can't honestly expect me to accept

202
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:21,080
this can you I mean this is ridiculous

203
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:22,759
what first off you didn't even type it

204
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,169
out and not only did you not type it out

205
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,960
but you never write in a pen you use

206
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:28,850
pencil well note that I could definitely

207
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,560
and I can convert that if you give me

208
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:32,419
like two or three days and how many

209
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,240
times have I told you I do not want you

210
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:36,800
using puns in your essays I honestly do

211
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,240
not recall writing the single one in

212
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,370
there like if if there is a point it's

213
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,870
probably my thesis I will prove that a

214
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,289
plant can survive off the flash of a

215
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:47,479
camera guess you could call it my

216
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:50,599
photosynthesis lol yeah I should have

217
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:52,520
took the lol oh right students at this

218
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:54,889
university has been months months

219
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:58,039
working on their essays and we spent one

220
00:07:54,889 --> 00:08:00,440
maybe an hour and tops okay no okay that

221
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:03,770
is that part is untrue okay you know

222
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,440
what that is that is just a that is a

223
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,070
sort of machine that doesn't take coins

224
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,770
it's nonsense

225
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:11,539
because the ending statement alone took

226
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,410
me over an hour maybe even more than

227
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:15,050
that really

228
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,490
yeah this just took you an hour the four

229
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,229
sentences four sentences that that's

230
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:21,880
ending see that's a conclusion on the

231
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:21,880
back of that back of one at the end

232
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,250
[Music]

233
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,510
it's supposed to get out okay overall

234
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,770
what I'm trying to say is there's gonna

235
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,570
be changes on this channel and I know

236
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:39,460
that a lot of you praise me and respect

237
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:41,380
me for not changing my content over the

238
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,460
years but this is something I have to do

239
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,990
for myself now that doesn't mean that

240
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,279
I'm gonna stop posting the videos that

241
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,380
you guys are used to it just means that

242
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,880
in between those videos because you know

243
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,589
those videos take a lot longer to make

244
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,240
sometimes a couple weeks to a month

245
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:53,800
sometimes two months I am gonna be

246
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,120
posting other things as well the other

247
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,560
things that I've been too afraid to pull

248
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,810
it's like rants that don't necessarily

249
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,370
have skits in them or skits that don't

250
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,690
necessarily have vlogs ridiculous songs

251
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,100
that we've made that make me and my

252
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,630

00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:16,150

280
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,500
take this time to say thank you to

281
00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:00,910
everybody who stuck around all the

282
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,350
people who have been watching over the

283
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,970
years I mean if you made it this far

284
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,830
into the video you're probably one of

285
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,060
them because it's pretty boring thank

286
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,890
you guys for being a loyal thank you

287
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,360
guys for continuing to why especially if

288
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,860
they're last year where I barely posted

289
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,450
anything ever since I really consider

290
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,910
quitting YouTube I actually had time to

291
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:18,520
think about it and it's honestly amazing

292
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,959
that I have been able to do this for so

293
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,640
long and it's really all because of you

294
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:23,770
guys some of you have been here over 10

295
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,180
years it's crazy sorry I know this is

296
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,740
weird for me especially for you people

297
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,720
who have been around for so long you

298
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,010
guys know me I don't like ending videos

299
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,079
cheesy like this but like I said changes

300
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:34,820
and I know it sounds selfish but I need

301
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:36,170
to do it for myself and I just think

302
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:38,449
it's time for me to just you know be

303
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:40,490
more open and honest and real with you

304
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:41,839
guys because again all jokes aside and

305
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,060
take away all the skits from this video

306
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,430
you guys are one of the main reasons why

307
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,889
not only do I want to continue doing

308
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:51,230
this but why I'm even able to just thank

309
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:53,300
you okay thank you guys I like I said I

310
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:56,329
hate those emotion over the emotional

311
00:10:53,300 --> 00:11:11,149
video there just seems so fake but you

312
00:10:56,329 --> 00:11:21,110
guys have no idea how much this one is

313
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:22,699
good yeah kind of see this is why I need

314
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,600
the podcast I can't ever have a serious

315
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:26,240
moment in here

316
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,010
oh yeah speaking of changes I'm droppin

317
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,389
a music video next week and I don't know

318
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,920
if it's a diss track but it's the

319
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:32,240
closest thing I've ever gotten to one

320
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,800
it's not really a diss is just basically

321
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,300
telling the truth because I am going to

322
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,980
be exposing a bunch of youtubers that

323
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,449
I've met over the years not all of them

324
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,180
just the ones that I've met in person

325
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:43,130
the ones that I feel need to show their

326
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:45,910
fans what they're really like outside of

327
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:48,910
YouTube so get ready because in a week

328
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,910

well not everyone like I mean like I

330
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:56,220
said just buried the specific youtubers
