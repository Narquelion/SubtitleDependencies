let's get into it before you guys start

111
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:16,920
fighting again let's start with the

112
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,750
easiest question that and the most

113
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,950
common thing that we got online since we

114
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,660
announced that you're gonna be here oh

115
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:23,310
no is there gonna be a broad question

116
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,050
it's it's not it we gotta go are

117
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:27,270
specific okay let's go into specifics

118
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,650
then okay and you know what I'm not even

119
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,450
ask you that until later let's talk

120
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,130
about something really current yeah

121
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,900
let's talk a little bit about how we

122
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,910
started talking again recently and that

123
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,510
is about the playoffs you asked a ball

124
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,390
player yes

125
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:41,490
so I told Ryan I've been watching my

126
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:43,410
basketball and I said you know you flirt

127
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,450
with the idea of talking about sports on

128
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,820
your podcast so not just basketball I

129
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:50,400
know you're a fan of wrestling I am but

130
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,410
I'm not a fan of watching it of watching

131
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,150
wrestling yeah you're only okay I like

132
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:56,580
to wrestle right I don't like watching

133
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:59,700
wrestling but you like I like like watch

134
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:01,080
yeah yeah okay I mixed I sorry yeah you

135
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,230
like watching and then a you like

136
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:07,800
watching NBA yeah and there you know

137
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:09,900
sports kind of niche your fans that

138
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,360
don't watch it don't really relate when

139
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,550
you're talking about correct they don't

140
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,440
usually relate yeah yeah so not a lot of

141
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,240
them at least right so when you tweet

142
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,020
about it you talk about it there's like

143
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,150
crickets you

144
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,310
most people I would say especially on

145
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:24,810
Twitter that's not the audience for it

146
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:27,090
there's some people especially because I

147
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,949
came out as a Spurs fan a while ago so I

148
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,509
have a bunch of like certain followers

149
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:32,729
that are Spurs fans that respond but

150
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:34,740
other than that it's like nobody cares

151
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:35,550
oh yeah Kauai just hit that game winner

152
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,919
in Game seven

153
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:40,970
I could tweet it but nobody on my feet

154
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:43,229
would carry would care if I tagged like

155
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:45,900
Raptors and Canadians or something like

156
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:47,340
there's no nobody would care I mean what

157
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,370
you wanted me to talk about that here

158
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,800
and I told you that I don't think most

159
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:56,430
people care about that stuff here I at

160
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,860
least so I'm convinced that people would

161
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:00,599
care maybe not Paco but but playoffs are

162
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,889
coming because it's so big everyone's

163
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:03,810
talking about it like yeah regular

164
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:06,030
layout sir I don't think people care

165
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,620
right like yeah you know there's 82

166
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,240
games in the regular season that's a lot

167
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,659
of games yeah and sometimes they play

168
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,069
back-to-back and to be honest I check it

169
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:16,919
every day even during the regular season

170
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:19,409
I said oh I'm a big fan and and I guess

171
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:21,810
you know Ryan's also a big fan um but

172
00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:25,169
the conversation was more like you know

173
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:26,969
people might not track the stats or as

174
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:29,250
much or like follow certain teams

175
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:32,550
because not every city as a team yeah

176
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:34,469
and you know YouTube is global luckily

177
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:37,139
NBA is becoming a little bit more global

178
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:39,960
but what I want to say is like sports in

179
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:42,419
itself can be relatable maybe not sure

180
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:45,479
the data or or certain players

181
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:48,750
franchises but just the what you can

182
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:52,050
learn from sports how sports can inspire

183
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:55,590
you you know to work hard and so it's

184
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:57,990
more of a reflection of like our culture

185
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:59,520
our you know our daily life and how we

186
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:02,009
can succeed right paka

187
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,900
yeah I just don't like that you said can

188
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:08,610
inspire you and you looked at me and

189
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:13,199
then said to work harder you try to pick

190
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:15,900
a fight again I'm sharing eye contact

191
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,340
and it just so happened that I wanted to

192
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,029
give you some inspiration I knew this

193
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,190
was gonna happen

194
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:26,130
I just Michael I know you work hard I

195
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:27,899
don't know what it is when he puts his

196
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,460
mind to something he gets it done it's

197
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:31,589
just getting him to put his mind into

198
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,729
something yeah but does he put his mind

199
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:35,909
on a lot of too many

200
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:37,829
things is better not really I'm I have

201
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:39,000
an addictive personality so if I really

202
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:40,829
like something then I just go hundred

203
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,589
percent into it that's good yeah I mean

204
00:08:40,829 --> 00:08:44,339
it's good if there's no gets bored

205
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:46,560
easily

206
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:48,269
yeah jump he jumps into different things

207
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,310
like he'll be into basketball one week

208
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:55,260
or maybe more than a week then you'll be

209
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:57,269
into stand-up or whatever it is yeah you

210
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:00,149
don't know me alright if you know me

211
00:08:57,269 --> 00:09:05,040
when's the first time we met internet

212
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:10,170
icon nope that is a no what are you why

213
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:12,420
yeah movie man uh-oh my name is continue

214
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:14,760
with your sports analogy it was getting

215
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:17,339
somewhere good it sounds like you're

216
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,670
being most sarcastic no it's um we're

217
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,350
good

218
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,610
it was getting somewhere good I mean

219
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,709
what I said what I need what I said

220
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,070
about it but you know I get what you're

221
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:25,709
saying

222
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:28,199
I just think like even like when I'm if

223
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:30,480
it were like me and Paco and we'll right

224
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:33,269
we're I mean the most regular people on

225
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,490
it unless the guess is somebody like you

226
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:37,560
they don't even watch basketball it's

227
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:40,079
hard to like even bring it up and talk

228
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,449
about it when even though I as much as I

229
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:44,370
like it it's like they probably didn't

230
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:45,779
see any of the games or really know

231
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,490
who's on whose team right I mean you

232
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:49,199
don't really know I mean I know only

233
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:51,660
like the stars names none of them yeah

234
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:53,819
but you know when in the playoffs like

235
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:57,600
when Kauai hit that yeah did you know

236
00:09:53,819 --> 00:10:00,120
that everybody move memes pape up for me

237
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,399
yeah means like when Damien hit that

238
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,339
that three-pointer up from like 35 feet

239
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,899
I mean people are gonna see that yeah

240
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:10,050
and you can talk about that but you know

241
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:12,120
in the playoffs there's more of those

242
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,769
happy accidents where people are like

243
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,449
hidden big shots and the pressures on

244
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:18,510
that's the thing about sports it's

245
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:20,310
competitive there's high stakes you know

246
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,199
these these players go through crazy

247
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:24,329
amounts of pressure they're playing back

248
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:26,069
you know on Monday Wednesday

249
00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:28,529
friday-sunday like they're playing four

250
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:30,800
games a week and it's just like you're

251
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:34,050
seeing people at the top of their game

252
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,510
go at it and like whether it's be sports

253
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:39,540
regular sports you know you watch movies

254
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:42,360
TV like you're getting the top athletes

255
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:45,360
or performers and they're just there in

256
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,350
the moment and it's it's transcendent of

257
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,630
just

258
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:51,090
oh I'm not a basketball fan like you can

259
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:53,520
respect and appreciate yeah you know

260
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:55,650
seeing like transcendent performers like

261
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,450
Kawhi Leonard yeah for instance because

262
00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:00,360
like no matter what you do to be like

263
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:02,610
the top 1% of what you do requires a lot

264
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,430
of hard work and dedication and you know

265
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:07,590
a lot of hours people don't see right at

266
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:10,760
like a few seconds of glory yeah that

267
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:13,170
they all do see ya so I guess trying a

268
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,660
segue into that you know you were one of

269
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:18,690
the top 1% of youtubers thrown amount of

270
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:22,440
time yeah but like you know I mean you

271
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:24,770
still had a very solid foothold in the

272
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:28,710
YouTube game you know like a well-known

273
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:31,170
amongst a lot of creators and fans and I

274
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:33,240
guess you know out of nowhere it kind of

275
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:35,520
you kind of just like fell off the face

276
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,380
of the earth were yeah you like

277
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,150
disappeared I didn't know that yeah

278
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,380
there's people were starting to put your

279
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:43,620
name right next to the like you know

280
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:45,450
Bigfoot and Loch Ness monster Jumba

281
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,930
that's when you started acting right

282
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:53,460
right so it it went through many stages

283
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:56,040
of like you know from you to to wanting

284
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,720
to do acting yeah and then transitioning

285
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:01,530
from like you know I'm gonna take a

286
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:03,870
break from this career chase and and

287
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:06,540
just focus on you know family and in my

288
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:08,250
life so from when you were like at the

289
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,080
top of your game cuz you didn't it's not

290
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,700
like you became all like although some

291
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,050
Kev's irrelevant and he's gonna stop it

292
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,090
was when you were still getting tons of

293
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:16,530
views you were still very popular you

294
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:20,460
just want to go a different direction I

295
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:22,470
would say so and and um and this goes

296
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:25,080
back this is gonna be like you know a

297
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:26,970
friend moment for us - but you were

298
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,530
doing YouTube and you like we had

299
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:32,130
private conversations where you're like

300
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:34,860
yo I'm committed to YouTube like this is

301
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:36,930
my bread and butter like I don't need to

302
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,220
do the whole LA thing I don't need to do

303
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,710
movies I don't need to act

304
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:43,860
I just love YouTube and I was like and

305
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:48,510

on the other side right like I I had so

308
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:58,250
much enjoyment on YouTube

309
00:12:53,100 --> 00:13:00,060
but I I felt like I felt a sense of like

310
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,950
harmony

311
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:05,040
some may not be the best word but it

312
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:07,530
felt like that you were gonna be able to

313
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,810
walk that path and because I was like

314
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:11,670
your quote/unquote brother like best

315
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:14,780
friend at the time I was like or one of

316
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:17,940
your best friends I know you know so I

317
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:20,370
was like yo I I get to still like

318
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,890
experience it through you so like if I

319
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:24,960
don't do that at least I like I know

320
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:26,550
that you get to live that life and I

321
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,650
could still like connect with you and be

322
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:30,540
like dude what's it like and so I was

323
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:32,730
able to like confidently go this other

324
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:35,430
direction right Adie I mean I didn't

325
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,690
know that but I mean I thought I'm at

326
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:38,610
the time like I remembered that we

327
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,530
talked about it and you did seem a

328
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:43,020
little like oh no you were just kind of

329
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:44,730
tired of being kept in a box like kind

330
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:48,750
of like you had this persona on line

331
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:50,970
right you you I mean you had a surgeon

332
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:53,310
persona I mean the same way I did up

333
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,930
until very recently where you felt like

334
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:57,060
you couldn't say certain things and you

335
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,200
couldn't act a certain way and then you

336
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,250
kind of wanted to get away from that

337
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,680
from what I remember

338
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:05,820
at least I I mean there was a there was

339
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:11,400
some of that um I felt like I had

340
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:13,680
YouTube I was making videos trying to do

341
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:17,610
it with other things that I was

342
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,470
interested in I was in LA so there was

343
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:22,680
there was a lot of influences right like

344
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:25,410
meeting older actors and getting their

345
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:28,590
perspective and and just seeing you know

346
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:30,750
I'm I grew up in Houston as an Asian

347
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:32,130
American which we'll have a conversation

348
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:35,430
about because you guys are from Hawaii

349
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:39,120
but I was always a minority and I was

350
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:42,180
always like told I can't do things like

351
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,580
you know I played soccer so I was always

352
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,710
the only Asian kid and I was I tried out

353
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:50,070
for club my first year and I was on the

354
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:52,290
e team that's the so they have a b c d e

355
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:54,300
so E is like Division three or four it's

356
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:55,620
like the lowest division and I didn't

357
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,150
even like there were so many kids I

358
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,370
tried out so there did they're basically

359
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:00,960
just grouping kids and like you know

360
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:03,000
that they had their favorite so they put

361
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,740
them on a and B but I was on the e team

362
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,620
Mike and I was like dude I don't even

363
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,330
think they saw me play uh-huh and I was

364
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,420
like the only Asian kid at the trial and

365
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:13,560
you know fast forward six years I'm on

366
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,750
the eighteen

367
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,670
like I'm on the a-team I've built a

368
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,950
relationship with trainers that are

369
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:21,360
world class like well not world clap but

370
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,760
they played professionally and they're

371
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,290
now training and they were like kept

372
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,240
mentoring me and eventually I became on

373
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:30,330
a team and it was just through you know

374
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:33,029
like proving that I'm not just you know

375
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:35,970
the scrawny asian kid like that needs to

376
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:38,279
be a class but but going into like

377
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:40,110
entertainment doing YouTube like a lot

378
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:44,550
of my videos were about being Asian

379
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:46,110
American and stereotypes and and and you

380
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:48,720
know I grew up in a culture where we

381
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:52,650
were you know especially Asian men like

382
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:58,529
do you masculine you know so so I think

383
00:15:52,650 --> 00:16:01,110
wanting to like like as a youtuber like

384
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:05,370
my audience was growing up as well I was

385
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:07,589
growing up and just wanting to have a

386
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:09,900
presence on on a more traditional

387
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:11,339
platform so that like people who are

388
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,690
like Oh Asian Americans don't belong in

389
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:15,420
Hollywood or Asian Americans don't

390
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:17,850
belong on TV or if you're gonna be on TV

391
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,830
you're just gonna happy the quirky best

392
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:24,690
friend or like the token Asian and I was

393
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:27,150
like I'm I'm not cool with that I'm not

394
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:30,360
cool with that but but that's that's all

395
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:33,030
that's a that's a whole nother I mean

396
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,220
that's fine I mean that shows it's just

397
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:36,900
interesting cuz you you saw that issue

398
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,250
right and then you just said you know

399
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,130
what I'm just gonna go do it and that's

400
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:42,450
something that I've always kind of

401
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,860
admired about you is when you set your

402
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:45,060
money you're kind of like hit that's why

403
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,230
you guys fight a lot you guys are very

404
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:50,120
similar when you really set your mind

405
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:54,410
something you just do it put us in this

406
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:57,830
you're like him with but with work ethic

407
00:16:54,410 --> 00:17:00,690
no honestly I'll let Paco speak okay

408
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:02,430
I'll correct and Paco is people who is

409
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:03,750
naturally he's like like we talked about

410
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,069
this before like in sports and stuff

411
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,870
he's naturally gifted

412
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:08,640
yeah like wow you were on the e team I

413
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:11,100
was already a team and I was out

414
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,319
practicing what I do like scrawny agent

415
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,860
down there dude yeah I was crying he was

416
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:16,170
huge

417
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:18,540
he had the arms but what I was saying is

418
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:19,679
that I mean that's what you've always

419
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:22,740
been like when you want to go into

420
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:26,160
acting you went full-on into acting I

421
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:27,370
did I loved it and you know we did like

422
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,010
I said we could do a whole park

423
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:34,030
about like you know just like the craft

424
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:37,390
of YouTube and the craft of Paco being

425
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:39,550
podcast host and entertaining himself

426
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:42,430
like there's a there was a there was a

427
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:44,410
process to it that I I I really enjoyed

428
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:45,790
huh and I mean like it would be cool to

429
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,530
like talk about that on another podcast

430
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,880
cuz then you could come back and then

431
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:53,440
you know bring the view yeah I mean

432
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:57,640

433
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,809
you will be like honestly no it'll help

434
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,429
I mean whenever we have guests it's

435
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:01,720
interesting and people want people have

436
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:04,000
been asking for you you know that's

437
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,890
great no I mean obviously you're welcome

438
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,929

439
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:10,870
maybe you can try out this YouTube thing

440
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:13,420
you know I mean you kind of cool got it

441
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:15,370
still it's being and I told you earlier

442
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:18,760
I think you should do a podcast I mean

443
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:20,860
you have like a radio voice and you're

444
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,750
really good at interviewing people I

445
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,670
mean you're naturally a host so like I

446
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,350
mean you could essentially be yeah be

447
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,809
fun what me and POC would do but in one

448
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:30,880
I'll just take Paco's job you could do

449
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:34,179
that I don't need that ik my own I mean

450
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:37,150
I I mean he's good but he doesn't you

451
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:40,980
know keep up on friends and he's not as

452
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:44,320
funny as I am his haircut is wack we're

453
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:46,990
not coming after your lame-ass job right

454
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,560
but this is a dope podcast I'm just

455
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:53,630
talking about specifically you're wrong

456
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:53,630
[Laughter]

457
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:58,390
actually that is something that uh Ryan

458
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:01,240
was talking about was like the

459
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:03,850
challenges above you because you're so

460
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,650
charismatic and on camera you're just

461
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:07,390
like a really likable and relatable

462
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:10,990
person and I think that's something that

463
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:12,640
a lot of people enjoyed and so to get

464
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:14,890
out of that shell when you went into

465
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,710
acting everything did that prove to be

466
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:19,600
something that seems to be a huge

467
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:21,429
obstacle because you were so used to

468
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,740
just you know being you on camera that

469
00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:25,120
if someone saw you in a different light

470
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,890
or in a different role they're like

471
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,370
that's kind of like being typecast yeah

472
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:32,830
that's not that i nodi I feel you

473
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:35,620
that's a good question Paco you did your

474
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:36,820
research like that's awesome I always do

475
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:39,460
my research that's why you ain't taking

476
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,970
my job that's true that's sure no so I

477
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:43,940
think

478
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:47,330
with with that with acting right like

479
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:51,049
the format is a little bit longer so if

480
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:52,610
you like play all your cards you know

481
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:53,929
people are gonna like lose interest

482
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:56,960
after a while so you kind of have to

483
00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:59,720
like internalize a lot of those like you

484
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:03,049
know the charisma or you know people

485
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:05,960
don't want like charismatic characters

486
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:07,940
on screen like you they do like in the

487
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,919
right moments but like not all the time

488
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:12,620
whereas YouTube you have to be turned on

489
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,030
all the time and it's yeah it's the

490
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,309
thing that I was talking about was with

491
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:18,020
I was like with Ryan earlier I was like

492
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:20,690
you know I think maybe Kevin just came

493
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:23,210
at a point where maybe it was a little

494
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:25,640
too early because now they are hiring

495
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:27,860
people who are just like charismatic in

496
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,440
just themselves like Kevin Hart or ken

497
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:32,120
Jeong or the rock you know yeah this is

498
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,820
these people who are truly themselves

499
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,620
where if you you know try to do your

500
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,000
right with you right if you came at the

501
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:41,480
right time it might have been just like

502
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,340
you know so like Ken Jeong Kevin Hart I

503
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,870
would put them in the comedian category

504
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:49,400
yeah I mean you're funny too you know

505
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:50,809
sometimes I know he knows dude you have

506
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,820
to tell him yeah we're talking about

507
00:20:50,809 --> 00:20:55,340
like putting them in categories of the

508
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,990
actor yeah Union but and the rock is I

509
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:59,299
would say he's an actor and he's been

510
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:03,020
doing like dramatic and they're all

511
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:04,640
really super high level talent eeeh 1%

512
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:07,190
like you're talking about but just the

513
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:10,370
category you know like yeah like a

514
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:12,890
communion needs to all as well always

515
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:15,740
just like more so bring a certain energy

516
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:18,200
right so I mean speaking on that is

517
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:19,640
there any just cuz I'm sure people gonna

518
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,960
ask what do you what are your plans like

519
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,140
what do you want to do next

520
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,580
Wow man okay so people are gonna ask

521
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:28,400
yeah sure yeah

522
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:31,190
no I came on this cuz we were gonna you

523
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,080
know get deep and talk about anything

524
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:35,210
that the fans want to hear and you guys

525
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,169
want to hear so the question being like

526
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:40,700
what do I want to do next

527
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:42,799
um I I've enjoyed I I would say I've

528
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:47,870
enjoyed having a more private private

529
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:52,460
life definitely last you know half

530
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:54,269
decade it's been it's been really tough

531
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:57,029
really challenging

532
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:59,909
so if I if I tried to like maintain

533
00:21:57,029 --> 00:22:02,940
YouTube and like do a career at the same

534
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:04,200
time I think I think I wouldn't have I

535
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,289
wouldn't be here right now you know I

536
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,849
would probably just like given up and

537
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:12,479
there were times where I like felt like

538
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:16,950
giving up and and so just to answer your

539
00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:19,729
question in a broad way like I'm just

540
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:22,649
kind of cultivating myself and then I

541
00:22:19,729 --> 00:22:26,339
feel like at some point there will be a

542
00:22:22,649 --> 00:22:29,239
period where I'm like I would love to

543
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:31,769
reconnect with with the people that I

544
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:35,070
collaborated with that we're part of

545
00:22:31,769 --> 00:22:39,209
this community of creators and also with

546
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:40,979
with audience subscribers viewers that

547
00:22:39,209 --> 00:22:43,139
supported me and grew up with me like

548
00:22:40,979 --> 00:22:46,409
that's the ultimate goal right but I

549
00:22:43,139 --> 00:22:48,419
want to be at a good place before I I do

550
00:22:46,409 --> 00:22:50,339
that right I make that connection with

551
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:51,629
them so is that like that sounds like a

552
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:53,879
comeback yeah

553
00:22:51,629 --> 00:22:55,259
I'm not calling it a comeback I'm just

554
00:22:53,879 --> 00:22:57,869
saying I'm trying to work on myself

555
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:59,549
yeah but eventually I mean you'd like to

556
00:22:57,869 --> 00:23:01,079
reach back out to that audience right

557
00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:03,599
well I'm not gonna sit here and be like

558
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:05,070
eventually I'm just gonna like like just

559
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:08,419
chill at home like I don't care about

560
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:12,690
them no like I eventually would love to

561
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:15,029
be in that position right but you know I

562
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:18,149
do like setup maybe I set a pretty high

563
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:20,579
bar like I you know cuz I I see you know

564
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:23,869
this we can I can change the topic but

565
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:29,129
you you see a lot of youtubers that that

566
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:31,709
they represent something like being an

567
00:23:29,129 --> 00:23:35,190
influencer and I like I just read The

568
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:37,070
New Yorker article with the makeup you

curator of the yeah yeah yeah so like

571
00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:47,759
that's a that's like a case study for

572
00:23:43,469 --> 00:23:50,519
like you have celebrity you have status

573
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:52,919
you have millions and millions and

574
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:55,289
millions of influence and followers but

575
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:58,739
like are you saying the right things are

576
00:23:55,289 --> 00:24:03,239
you being the right person and I feel

577
00:23:58,739 --> 00:24:04,979
like there are there are really good

578
00:24:03,239 --> 00:24:06,839
role models out there that I can like

00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:09,330
for and

581
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:12,630
until I can like look at myself and be

582
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:16,260
like okay I can I can be that role model

583
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:19,140
to on that on that very big public level

584
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:21,630
maybe not anything as close as like the

585
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:24,960
heyday you know back in what 2010 to

586
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:26,580
2012 but like even I had a small level

587
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,000
like yeah what I would love to do that

588
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,710

me on YouTube there's like there's

594
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:46,549
definitely like an absence there and

595
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:48,720
it's it sounds it so it's almost like a

596
00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:50,010
relationship type of thing where it's

597
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,590

598
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:55,530

639
00:26:44,129 --> 00:26:49,080
bars too boy oh we're gonna talking

640
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:52,440
about that you guys actually made music

641
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,179
together and some really I know you know

642
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,039
it's all plan fire you has been really

643
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:57,570
like successful songs and I kind of want

644
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:59,849
to know before we go into the shishi

645
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:01,739
break how was the collaboration process

646
00:26:59,849 --> 00:27:03,659
on that I mean I think it though it

647
00:27:01,739 --> 00:27:05,249
stemmed from the joke of being like hey

648
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:07,830
can we get away with doing something

649
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:10,409
like make a love song almost about

650
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:12,059
something while being douchey mm-hmm the

651
00:27:10,409 --> 00:27:14,099
joke was being douchey yeah essentially

652
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:17,039
but then us getting away with it giving

653
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:18,450
a a reason to do it being that were nice

654
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,489
guys because we don't I mean we wanted

655
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:23,009
to play the nice guys we didn't want to

656
00:27:20,489 --> 00:27:25,679
be actual douches so it was a way for us

657
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:27,929
to do those jokes without having to I

658
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,220
guess be real douches because it's not

659
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:32,340
funny if you're actually being a douche

660
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:34,619
right yeah it's yeah it was like a so it

661
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:38,009
was Ryan myself and also Chester yeah

662
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:40,889
and he wanted to do a song like you use

663
00:27:38,009 --> 00:27:43,229
it he's a musician so he was like like

664
00:27:40,889 --> 00:27:44,639
pitching us song ideas all the time I

665
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:47,849
feel like and it was great his

666
00:27:44,639 --> 00:27:49,499
creativity was very motivating and and

667
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:52,289
then he kind of had this hook he was

668
00:27:49,499 --> 00:27:53,970
like mm and he would just sing it and

669
00:27:52,289 --> 00:27:55,889
then and then like when it finally

670
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:58,559
clicked for him for him I give a lot of

671
00:27:55,889 --> 00:28:00,029
yeah I do give credit to Chester for

672
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:03,059
coming up with that kind of hook and

673
00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:05,849
then and then because we did shed it

674
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:07,159
tear like it was a lot of circumstances

675
00:28:05,849 --> 00:28:10,019
that went into it and Ryan has a

676
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:12,539
specific humor where he likes to like be

677
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:14,309
hardcore and like but then like there's

678
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:15,539
some heart to it so it was a it was a

679
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:17,849
good combination and and shout out to

680
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:20,669
Wong foo cuz like they they started like

681
00:28:17,849 --> 00:28:22,499
the Asian being nice guys thing and we

682
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:25,529
was just like a lot of things coming

683
00:28:22,499 --> 00:28:27,119
into play and and yeah I wish we were

684
00:28:25,529 --> 00:28:29,190
able to like incorporate more of the

685
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:31,309
community in that but we ended up going

686
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:33,570
and shooting the video like the same we

687
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:35,399
pounded it right I mean we'd happen

688
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:36,690
really fast we thought it was a

689
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:39,869
your video but we didn't think it was

690
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:41,909
gonna be like No yeah zero zero budget I

691
00:28:39,869 --> 00:28:45,059
mean but back then though like everyone

692
00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:46,710
yeah and then if you got like even a

693
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:47,669
decent amount of you see because this we

694
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:50,039
knew I was gonna get some views because

695
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:52,499
it was bigger bigger production for us

696
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:55,259
at the time of YouTube nobody was really

697
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:57,269
making like that kind of content we knew

698
00:28:55,259 --> 00:28:58,979
that if we put that out and get more

699
00:28:57,269 --> 00:29:00,779
views back then if you got that kind of

700
00:28:58,979 --> 00:29:02,129
views and likes and favorites you would

701
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:04,830
be on the front page so they just

702
00:29:02,129 --> 00:29:08,099
exponentially just boosts everything so

703
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:09,719
I mean it was I mean we you posted that

704
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:11,940
version of your channel I posted in mind

705
00:29:09,719 --> 00:29:13,619
it was bound to it was a little easier

706
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:15,899
to understand the algorithm we knew the

707
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:18,029
algorithm yeah we like you interests you

708
00:29:15,899 --> 00:29:20,549

709
00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:22,619
to post how to post how to get the

710
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:25,080
viewers in and it just yeah I just

711
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:27,359

know I mean you have a bass voice but it

723
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:15,089

00:30:12,929 --> 00:30:17,909
that the sound just escapes all three or

725
00:30:15,089 --> 00:30:20,519
Phasis at the same time fake news that's

726
00:30:17,909 --> 00:30:22,019
not how science works per sign I should

727
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:25,889
just make out hurt and neither do you

728
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:28,109

00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:11,180
ten years congratulations it did take me

745
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:13,430
ten years on and on yeah and what did

746
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:16,070
you what's your degree in so it's it's

747
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:19,490
psychology I finished my last is that

748
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:24,080
even a real degree and a half online uh

749
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:26,600
and like I had done so many courses like

750
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,520
I would take you know riding courses

751
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,800
I've done I've hopped major so many

752
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:33,950
times and then it was just more product

753
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:35,800
of like what's what's like what's the

754
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:38,960
most convenient for me

755
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:40,580
and it was again psychology yeah it was

756
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,790
I'm not saying psychology is like

757
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:47,810
convenient it's a very complex and high

758
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:51,740
level like science but for me at the

759
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:54,020
time I like wasn't always at at home and

760
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:56,630
I didn't wasn't able to travel to campus

761
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:59,840
like well every week so I just didn't

762
00:31:56,630 --> 00:32:02,210
online degree Pam yeah but only those

763
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,280
last few years most of my degree was in

764
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:05,690
class but just the last two years was

765
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,850
online got it

766
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:10,610
well I mean like I was saying though

767
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:13,910
kept got into UC Davis what you get into

768
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:15,890
so I got into a lot of trouble uh you

769
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:17,870
know you know I also got it actually I

770
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:21,860
didn't even make it to you H you didn't

771
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:25,250
make the UA more like everyone in Hawaii

772
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:29,120
that's like their fallback like I want

773
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:30,200
to laugh but I'd feel no we're gonna

774
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,110
we're gonna offend all the people who

775
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:36,080
didn't I know I don't know what it

776
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:40,340
really means to very common in Hawaii

777
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:42,320
you know 2.8 GPA did you just get in

778
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:44,900
yeah okay I didn't get that do you still

779
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:47,510
have dreams like about like high school

780
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:49,520
or like maybe not passing a class or no

781
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:51,320
no no do you I do

782
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,390
yeah I still have dreams when I'm like

783
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,340
in school like I'm like

784
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:56,950
I've dreams where I'm retaking middle

785
00:32:54,340 --> 00:33:00,250
school and those are like are you a kid

786
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:02,530
dreams I'm no that's nightmare mortal

787
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:04,660
yeah it's more like an Asian nightmare

788
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:06,490
yeah okay but it's like because what I

789
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:10,150
feel like I could probably start like a

790
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:12,460
an a group on this yeah I I think well

791
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:13,570
we're your parents those I mean I've met

792
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:16,000
your parents but were they scary

793
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:19,510
typically like strict like Asian parents

794
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,760
you know they you know regardless of

795
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:23,410
them personally yeah it was just like

796
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,410
it's a cultural thing it was you I don't

797
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:29,020
you want it to be know me yeah strictly

798
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:30,490
were you a good student no oh

799
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:34,059
how'd you get into UC David that's a

800
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:36,340
pretty guys YouTube when I don't like my

802
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:42,549
right right right

803
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:45,460
got it yeah my grades were I don't think

804
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:46,720
I was top fifty percent but I went to a

805
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,730
very competitive high school i

806
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,950
shouldn'ta liek that oh yeah I didn't I

807
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:52,570
didn't my grades weren't good

808
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:54,340
you shouldn't have leaked what I wasn't

809
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:56,380
even like in the top fifty percent of my

810
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,610
high school that's fly mints I I mean

811
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:59,950
and then look where you are

812
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:02,500
em I guess so still got your degree

813
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:06,280
right you went on this crazy adventure

814
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:07,840
of eat that is YouTube now licking ya

815
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,850
know you're in movies you did a bunch of

816
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,690
stuff and you didn't its you didn't need

817
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:12,550
to get straight A's

818
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:14,679
right you could still do things right

819
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:17,740
and my parents still love me there you

820
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:18,879
go yeah it's all your kids out there are

821
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:20,619
your kids out there doing really poorly

822
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:23,080
in school we're not encouraging you to

823
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:25,450
do that yeah but it's it's possible to

824
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,859
make it better do well for parents yep

825
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:27,790
for yourself but actually you know

826
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:33,159
talking about your relationship with

827
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:37,470
your parents and going into it the same

828
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:37,470
I like it when ya going NACO talks a lot

829
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:50,619
sounds like a dude no go ahead

830
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:54,879
but going so the question that comes

831
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:58,119
from Twitter and it's a from Tony stank

832
00:34:54,879 --> 00:35:00,100
south Tony what's the best slash funny

833
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:02,350
memory you have while filming a video

834
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,820
with your dad because you said your

835
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,500
relationship with them wasn't so

836
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:08,619
stereotypically Asian

837
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:10,510
you know so I didn't say that well were

838
00:35:08,619 --> 00:35:13,320
they wearing I said I was talking about

839
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:15,400
the strictness of you know it was a

840
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:18,190
stereotypically agent oh really

841
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,470
okay yeah so then I guess if you could

842
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:21,369
explain you know because the

843
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:23,530
relationship with your dad was very

844
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:26,650
public and it's very like you know smile

845
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:27,880
that part was not so I guess what was

846
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:29,770
your favorite memory and what was that

847
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,590
like - I'm trying to think of a specific

848
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:34,210
memory but like I mean one comes to mind

849
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:36,369
when when we did like what we hate about

850
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:39,420
each other and Mike there's this one

851
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:41,800
joke I like could not stop laughing and

852
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:44,140
he was just talking about my like bad

853
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,540
eating habits and like where I would

854
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:49,180
like not close my mouth I would eat

855
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:51,670
loudly and the way he said it was like

856
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:56,619
he used the example of like you know

857
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:58,710
when you eat noodles he's like my dad

858
00:35:56,619 --> 00:36:03,760
but you can watch the video he's like

859
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:06,010
like a noodle when you eat the noodle

860
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,420
and I was like at first I didn't know

861
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:10,720
what he was saying but what and then he

862
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:14,260
just kept saying second noodles and I

863
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,510
was like yeah that one that one comes to

864
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:18,640
mind yeah I mean he's like like you said

865
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:20,410
it seemed like he was having fun and he

866
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,089
did it I mean I don't I don't really

867
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:26,950
know I mean it seemed like he enjoyed

868
00:36:22,089 --> 00:36:29,560
that attention right yeah yeah so I

869
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:32,580
didn't have to like pay him back her

870
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:34,810
mm-hmm you know give him residual checks

871
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:37,270
I'm sure he wasn't asking for him yeah

872
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:39,790
but yeah and that's that was that's

873
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:42,430
unique to him and he just like I'm

you're gonna make him knock oh it was

900
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:51,250
bad it was it hurt a lot and I was sad

901
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:53,380
and my parents were sad and I had a like

902
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:55,150
walk a long way back to get back to

903
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:57,730
health I mean you I mean this is where

904
00:37:55,150 --> 00:38:00,309
where did this happen um it happened in

905
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:02,920
NorCal just so people okay yeah by

906
00:38:00,309 --> 00:38:05,380
myself I was by myself - and you said

907
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:09,910
you still I mean it still hurts you

908
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:13,480
today uh well yeah yeah I I still have

909
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:16,720
residual pain from but talking you want

910
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,099
to go and talk about pain no no no I

911
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,480
mean you can we're asking about your

912
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:22,690
story so you know we want to hear more

913
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:24,130
from you I know I know what I need

914
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:26,680
empathy if we're going to talk about it

915
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:27,940
yeah I mean I mean yeah I mean it it

916
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:30,279
sounds like something that you know that

917
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:32,980
you have to deal with a lot consistently

918
00:38:30,279 --> 00:38:35,140
and it's always something that but I

919
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:36,730
guess because of the pain it's allowed

920
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:39,130
you to grow you know obstacles in your

921
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:41,920
life for the things that either cause

922
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:45,539
you to change and adapt for the better

923
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:48,609
or you either like let this toxicity

924
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:50,559
like just fester in you and you just

925
00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:52,539
like are matted like situations around

926
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:54,670
you and you know but it seems like you

927
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:55,359
took it in like kind of like made it

928
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:59,019
into a positive

929
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:00,670
I would say I'm living with living with

930
00:38:59,019 --> 00:39:04,230
it yeah sure

931
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:06,940
I wouldn't like put this like

932
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:09,400
inspirational ideal twist on it and say

933
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:13,359
it's like been a positive experience for

934
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:16,809
me but it's definitely been it's

935
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:19,180
definitely been an obstacle and and part

936
00:39:16,809 --> 00:39:22,119
of overcoming those things is is gonna

937
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:23,950
make you stronger but but I'm not too

938
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:26,920
focused on on the end result of like

939
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:29,049
coming out of this like stronger and

940
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,059
like ready to like teach the world how

941
00:39:29,049 --> 00:39:33,310
to deal with you know this kind of thing

942
00:39:31,059 --> 00:39:34,750
that would be like

943
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:36,160
that would be like down the line but

944
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:38,410
right now I'm just just trying to like

945
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:40,420
live a normal life what do you have to

946
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:43,210
say on the matter Ryan well I mean I

947
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:44,350
don't think we should keep you don't

948
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:46,300
want us talk about we don't have to keep

949
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:48,040
on that so yeah I just think it would

950
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,930
take up longer than Ian that's why I

951
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:52,030

the moderator I don't know yeah yeah so

957
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:11,380
like right now you know like there's a

958
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,760
little bit like you know dissing between

959
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:16,210
us it's like friendly competition or

960
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:18,040
whatever but when you were near the you

961
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:19,900
know the top of YouTube and stuff and

962
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:22,120
you and Ryan were kind of like like best

963
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:24,910
friends side-by-side did you view him as

964
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:26,440
competition though in a way cuz I was

965
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:30,150
like you're a very competitive person I

966
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:33,870
am but Lydon I love humble people and

967
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:36,490
Ryan's one of those and so like I think

968
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:40,180
before I met him like there was a lot of

969
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:42,280
YouTube like like oh they're both Asian

970
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:44,500
and they're comedians and and they

971
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:47,050
should like who's better but like once I

972
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:49,300
met Ryan that like that did like

973
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:52,900
evaporate it was like literally gone a

974
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:56,110
lot of a lot of people kind of like our

975
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:57,970
fans would make us have some kind of

976
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:59,590
beef big day would have beef and I

977
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:00,700
compared you know I mean you've seen it

978
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,050
you've seen the comments people just

979
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:03,970
naturally because there wasn't many

980
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:05,590
Asian I mean there was agents but me

981
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:07,630
Kevin I where we were at the top at the

982
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:09,790
time so naturally people are gonna

983
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:12,220
compare us because we're both Asians and

984
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:16,150
we do comedy or yeah you're doing vlogs

985
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:17,920

also very different yeah and my

989
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:27,520
completely there was such a big need for

990
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:30,340
like Asian American like there was

991
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,320

1010
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:19,420
I'll give my side on yeah I was just

1011
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:22,030
like you know I saw Ryan as you know

1012
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:23,860
like influenced a big big deal

1013
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:26,590
and I was like you know you're about to

1014
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:28,120
see like all these people in person for

1015
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:29,680
the first time like I've been to YouTube

1016
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,570
events but yeah that was my first event

1017
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,610
it's overwhelming and there's like you

1018
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:35,470
take hundreds of pictures or you're

1019
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:36,820
meeting lots of people you know you're

1020
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,290
meeting not just like viewers

1021
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:40,570
subscribers you're also meeting other

1022
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:43,630
youtubers that you follow and like or

1023
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:45,850
maybe look up to and not to but you were

1024
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:47,920
you were just so humble that you you're

1025
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:51,220
like I'm just gonna wear a grey

1026
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,740
undershirt and like some jeans and let's

1027
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:55,360
just go and I was like dude you're

1028
00:42:53,740 --> 00:43:02,800
behind you like are you gonna wear you

1029
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:04,600
know I do remember like coming like

1030
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,760
we're about to go okay and then I

1031
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:16,090
remember coasting oh you're gonna wear

1032
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:22,690
that I think the timing was like almost

1033
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:24,700
the most self-conscious things I always

1034
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:26,110
say about keV is he'll say things and

1035
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,550
even if it's like whether it's funny or

1036
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:30,250
if people get offended a lot of times

1037
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:32,830
it's not to be mean it's literally just

1038
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:34,240
blunt just honesty hmm

1039
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:36,040
I think a lot of times you say things

1040
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,930
even though or it's overly sarcastically

1041
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:41,560
what do you guys would have been doing

1042
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:43,300
all day and then you'll be like oh no I

1043
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,770
meant all of it but people will really

1044
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:47,620
believe that but they were I realize

1045
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:49,180
that you're joking but like I didn't I

1046
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:51,100
had just met him that day other than

00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:51,610

1075
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:51,700
anyway we basically lived in the same

1076
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:53,710
building so we'd I mean there's so many

1077
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:56,460
we saw each other almost every day for

1078
00:44:53,710 --> 00:45:00,360
like years so I mean it's hard to say

1079
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:02,380
one specific thing I was your favorite

1080
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:06,310
consistent thing then about each other

1081
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:10,120
are it consistent yeah I mean we we

1082
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:11,920
lived next to the dance community too so

1083
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:14,860
like you know obviously my roommate was

1084
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:18,850
Victor his was d-trix we were next to em

1085
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:21,040
else to do like a crew from Houston that

1086
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:23,260
I'm fond of so real crew was like Ryan

1087
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,730
post post they were all like we were in

1088
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:27,340
the same circle and then you had the

1089
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:29,140
acoustic singers like junior who was

1090
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:31,090
here the two weeks ago

1091
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:33,250
just so many talented people so like the

1092
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:36,460
consistent thing was like just being

1093
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:39,820
awed by like and our place was like the

1094
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:42,820
kind of hangout spot for just all these

1095
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:44,560
people to like just kick back jam

1096
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:46,690
sessions were crazy like we would just

1097
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:49,030
like turn on the camera and do like the

1098
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:51,730
spam freestyle or and then like behind

1099
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:53,980
the camera like people are like just

1100
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:55,600
like haven't liked playing beer pong or

1101
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:57,640
something you know so like we were just

1102
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,900
having fun but it was also like kind of

1103
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:01,240
productive because like us being

1104
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:02,920
together like was like good for our

1105
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:05,200
community and just like sharing talent

1106
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:09,280
and so I was like that was consistently

1107
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:12,820
pretty cool yeah yeah I will say like we

1108
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,260
I mean I got spoiled by that like we

1109
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:16,090
were surrounded by like the

1110
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:19,330
dancers in the world the top some of the

1111
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:21,250
top singers you know and they would just

1112
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:23,200
be like we had a regular party you just

1113
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:24,940
be like making up songs on the spot

1114
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:27,250
while people dance to it yeah yes the

1115
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:29,230
most amazing like choreo you see me lox

1116
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:30,850
and freestyle rapping and it's just like

1117
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:32,350
all this talent and we would happen all

1118
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:34,900
the time that I just didn't appreciate

1119
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:40,060
it as much because I'd like the least

1120
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:41,500
yeah we had no talent on my gym tour we

1121
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:44,920
had to make skits because we were like

1122
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:47,440
we just announce people's names like

1123
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:50,050
here's another good person at what they

1124
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:52,030
do and we're just like we would slow jam

1125
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:54,700
sessions and we just be filling up space

1126
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:57,880
yeah like anyone could have been us yeah

1127
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:59,950
but we got to witness it and we did not

1128
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:02,560
film that a lot of times the best cover

1129
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:03,970
you weren't even filled yeah and we did

1130
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,850
not carry our responsibilities well

1131
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:08,380
that's the only thing that's all

1132
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:10,359
contributed was like sharing it yeah

1133
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:13,000
dang people are gonna be upset and my

1134
00:47:10,359 --> 00:47:15,550
other we just you know I remember that

1135
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,290
though is because when jr. came back and

1136
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:19,480
he sang just for a little bit like we

1137
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:21,220
didn't ask jam or anything yeah I was

1138
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:24,609
just like damn this is so good I'm like

1139
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:25,960
a show yeah and I forgot how like I took

1140
00:47:24,609 --> 00:47:27,880
this for granted because they used to be

1141
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:31,960
there all the time and sing guys to it

1142
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:33,160

00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,840
