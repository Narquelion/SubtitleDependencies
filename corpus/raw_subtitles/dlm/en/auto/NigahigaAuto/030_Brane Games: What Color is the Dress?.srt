1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,810
what color is the dress is it black and

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,970
blue or white and gold or maybe a

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,620
different color altogether scientists

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,660
have tried to science it theorists have

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,759
attempted to theorize so what is the

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,530
true answer is suddenly infamous

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:19,710
question find out next on an all new

8
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:21,480
episode of brain gum hello welcome to

9
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,279
brain gummies and today we are gonna be

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,619
solving the mystery of the ever so

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,359
popular color changing dress but before

12
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,980
we do that it's important that we warm

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,900
up our brains a little bit first I have

14
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,980
my volunteer here named Ryan and he's

15
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,780
gonna be participating in brain ganas

16
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:38,700
aha that was the first test did you

17
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,200
realize Ryan that we actually already

18
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,059
did the intro sequence and that was the

19
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,430
second time we showed him how yeah I

20
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,050
mean that just happened right before you

21
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,300
introduced yourself see just like Ryan

22
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,129
here your brain is not warm enough to be

23
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,170
ready for such a difficult question such

24
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:54,030
as what color is the dress so what we

25
00:00:52,170 --> 00:01:00,329
need to do first is warm up that brain

26
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:01,680
with a little brain ganas you see if you

27
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:03,329
thought the title sequence was gonna

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,630
start again then you were completely

29
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:08,250
wrong on to our first game it's called

30
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,720
the math psyche so this is for all of

31
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,250
you at home just follow along I'm gonna

32
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,260
put up a number of fingers behind my

33
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,580
back but before I reveal what that is I

34
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,140
want all of you at home to pick a number

35
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,150
in your head got it

36
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,340
good now add five to your original

37
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:24,299
number whatever number you're at now

38
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,400
subtract one and now add two now

39
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,960
subtract your original number that you

40
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,759
started off with because the number

41
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,650
you're at right now is the exact number

42
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:36,680
of fingers I have up behind my back

43
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:39,390
that's right six welcome to brain ganas

44
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,369
our next game is called the Train Saw

45
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,810
Massacre I'm gonna be using my volunteer

46
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:45,329
Ryan but I want all of you at home to

47
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,040
follow along so Ryan if two trains are

48
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:48,899
on the same track headed towards one in

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,659
the train a is going 50 miles per hour

50
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:51,990
while train B is going 50 kilometres an

51
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,909
hour

52
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,799
assuming there's no wind and both trains

53
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,479
left the station at the same time what

54
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,479
is most likely to be yelled out by the

55
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:05,800
passengers on train a is it a all of the

56
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:09,100
above B help C no or D let go

57
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:11,350
how am I supposed to I guess see so

58
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,670
close the answers B C and D actually

59
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,290
would have been correct if we were

60
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,820
talking about train B because it's

61
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,470
probably filled with foreigners being

62
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,600
that they measure in kilometers however

63
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,460
the question was about train a measured

64
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,410
in miles brow which means most of the

65
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,760
passengers were Americans and those are

66
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,070
not what Americans would say in that

67
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,780
scenario I mean even with that that all

68
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:30,370
that's left is the letter A all of the

69
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,010
above and there's nothing else above it

70
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,960
so wrong again the answer is actually a

71
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,940
all of the above you have to think

72
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,240
outside of the box with box you see the

73
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:42,790
correct answers were e who cares F this

74
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:46,210
is so dumb G this needs to stop because

75
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:47,740
if it doesn't or a to try I couldn't

76
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,270
even see those though so that's not

77
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,040
really fair right you have to see the

78
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:55,150
full picture Ryan I mean after all this

79
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,610
is brain gummit and finally we have our

80
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,320
last game it's called what do you see on

81
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,120
the screen probably one of our simpler

82
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,300
games all you have to do is tell me what

83
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,760
do you see on the screen Ryan um the

84
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,980
letter A wrong the correct answer is a

85
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,750
color red oh I thought you were talking

86
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,120
next question what do you see on the

87
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,670
screen now do you see the color blue yes

88
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,680
wrong again the correct answer is the

89
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,390
letter A but you're the one that has the

90
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,060
next question what do you see on the

91
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,730
screen now well I see the letter A and

92
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,800
it's colored grey grey spelled with an A

93
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:29,320
or with an E does it matter not really

94
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,000
okay I guess with an A then wrong the

95
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,250
answer we were looking for gray with an

96
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,750
even still wrong what the correct answer

97
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,880
we were looking for was the letter A

98
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,680
colored a light black I don't think

99
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,840
that's even in however if we were to

100
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,880
darken this gray colored a to the color

101
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,770
black what do you see on the screen now

102
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,570
okay you said that that was the color

103
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:48,250
black correct and nothing physically

104
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:50,200
changed in the image from the last one

105
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:53,980
right indeed okay then the answer has to

106
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:56,890
be the letter A colored black Ryan that

107
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:59,080
is absolutely wrong what the correct

108
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:01,330
answer was a ninety degree rotated

109
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:04,420
unfinished drawing of pac-man eating a

110
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:06,820
tic-tac next and final question god what

111
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:08,620
letter do you see on the screen now what

112
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,880
letter correct and nothing to do with

113
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,860
the color right indeed and it's awesome

114
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,630
stupid answer like an unfinished drawing

115
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,010
of pac-man

116
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:17,400
actual letter in the English alphabet

117
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:20,760
that is correct okay this then it has to

118
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:23,010
be the letter a wrong the correct answer

119
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,260
was an extremely zoomed in picture of

120
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:27,660
the letter B okay but the letter B is

121
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,670
made up of a bunch of A's so technically

122
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,980
my answer wasn't wrong this time right

123
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,630
wrong again the B is not made from a

124
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,640
bunch of aids then what is it made of

125
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:38,670
then unfinished pac-man drawing no son

126
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:40,260
of them and finally now that your brain

127
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,630
is warmed up and ready we'll ask the

128
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,010
question once again what color is the

129
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,810
dress well now that your brain is

130
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,490
prepared you can finally see the full

131
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,920
picture and I'll answer your question

132
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,420
with another question is the dress even

133
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,100
a dress people assumed that it was

134
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,090
addressed when really if you do what

135
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,830
I've been telling you to do throughout

136
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,510
this entire episode and see the full

137
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:00,600
picture you'll see that this infamous

138
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:02,010
dress is actually a shirt it's a shirt

139
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,720
how it all makes sense why you have me

140
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,430
doing all those stupid exercise this

141
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,470
whole time everybody was arguing about

142
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,570
the color of the dress but when you look

143
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:12,630
at the full picture the true answer to

144
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:16,040
the question is it's a shirt wrong what

145
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:19,020
the correct answer is actually a

146
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,310
seriously you made me and the audience

147
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,780
go through all of this and you're not

148
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:24,000
only gonna give us a serious answer I

149
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,980
did answer it the answer is a that makes

150
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,360
no sense what does the letter A have

151
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,040
anything to do with the color of the

152
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,930
dress well not the letter A the answer

153
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,790
is a you have to see the full picture

154
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:36,229
remember you have to think outside the

155
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:39,030
box the answer is actually a

156
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:40,530
all of the above yep and the next time

157
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:42,569
somebody asks you the question what

158
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:45,900
color is the dress all you have to do is

159
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:48,479
say a all of the above who cares this is

160
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:54,569
so stupid this needs to stop because if

161
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:58,699
it doesn't if it doesn't then what two

162
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:58,699
trains see now you're on the right track

163
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,250
so thank you guys again so much for

164
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,569
watching if you want to see bloopers and

165
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,560
behind the scenes click on the left if

166
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,240
you want to see the previous video click

167
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,590
the one on the right and so I know you

168
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,389
guys are already gonna ask the colors

169
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:17,389
that I see are actually the colors
