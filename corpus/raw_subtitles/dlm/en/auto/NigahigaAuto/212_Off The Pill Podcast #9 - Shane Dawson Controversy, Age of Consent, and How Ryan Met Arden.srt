51
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,720
I don't know I don't feel very cool

52
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:37,360
right now why don't why don't you feel

53
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,040
cool right now dude you know I mean for

54
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,340
one we're sitting in this tiny little

55
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,590
room

56
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,000
I wonder people when they watch this do

57
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,090
you think they think this room is big

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,890
because we're not like in the same shot

59
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,750
that's one thing yeah for sure when you

60
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:51,310
watch it cuz I I when I want I mean we

61
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,750
know what the room looks looks bigger

62
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,700
does it look bigger I think so it's like

63
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,680
you know when you watch TV shows and

64
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,820
then you go watch it like I remember we

65
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,400
went to a BDC

66
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,420
when they saw it on TV and you went and

67
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,430
watching a live audience you're like

68
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,960
yeah dude this room is so small like how

69
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,180
do they do it like it's true you know

70
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,290
even NBA games yeah when you go to when

71
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,600
you go there I mean the people are

72
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:12,520
obviously gigantic but if you go to

73
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:16,600
actual if you go to an actual NBA game

74
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:19,360
using see if you go to an actual game

75
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,830
it's the court looks so small in

76
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,540
comparison to what it looks like on TV

77
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:24,130
and the stadium itself I mean the

78
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,930
stadium is big but the court looks so

79
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:28,510
small and the people are just gigantic

80
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,340
there's got to be some kind of like a

81
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,860
like name for that right like there's

82
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,930
something something effect is that like

83
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,210
the camera adds 15 pounds to you like

84
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,550
that's everything that really does that

85
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:41,590
that does happen though no higher

86
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:44,830
definite I don't know why but even like

87
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,990
even in person like I remember I went to

88
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:49,540
go watch a Spurs game and I saw for the

89
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:51,490
first time I saw um Manu Ginobili in

90
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,040
person doing all the clothes because

91
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:56,890
we're sitting behind the Spurs bench and

92
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,690
he looked so tall and skinny mm-hmm I

93
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,790
was like dude he looks so unhealthy

94
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,620
right now but like on TV they look

95
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,780
normal he looks skinny on TV but like in

96
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,420
person they all look so much taller and

97
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,070
skinnier yeah makes you wonder who else

98
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,890
what do we really look like in person

99
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:13,959
actually everybody says that we're a lot

100
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:17,590
shorter than they thought we would be

101
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:19,299
yeah I don't know that's sad

102
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,859
it's hard to tell with like YouTube also

103
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:22,390
because you don't really see usually

104
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:23,550
like you can't see our legs yeah I'm

105
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,379
gonna

106
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,879
sitting like this in the podcast like

107
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:29,370
we've met people that we didn't know

108
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,319
we're super tall last the case I was

109
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:34,620
actually kind of tall okay so all the

110
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:35,819
big though all the really big - he

111
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,520
doesn't look tall but he's actually

112
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:40,620
pretty tall rice come my school yeah

113
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,659
yeah like who were there right we're

114
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,520
just short they also we're normal like

115
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:48,990
normal height but we're all like 4 feet

116
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:51,690
5 speaking of which chaos is coming into

117
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:54,270
town again and he went to a club I'm not

118
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:58,169
sure what with all of us wait is it just

119
00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:00,810
him or the sidemen aside mint - he's the

120
00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:03,629
one who you know so I think they want to

121
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,159
do some kind of collab what but um we

122
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:06,629
should think of something - maybe we

123
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:08,159
should you know what he'd do is make it

124
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:09,389
like a suprise because he didn't tell me

125
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:12,960
what they're gonna do either so we

126
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:14,219
should surprise him and like just I

127
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,229
don't know what should we should just

128
00:05:14,219 --> 00:05:18,000
all when he walked into the room would

129
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:19,800
just box him all of them oh yeah he

130
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,050
loves and we just like start mauling him

131
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,900
just mob him I think I still probably

132
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:27,389
knock us all out yeah he's so big we're

133
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,190
only 4 or 5 no but then the the twist is

134
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:31,889
we all lose on purpose and then out of

135
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:34,110
your room comes Logan ooh and then they

136
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:35,729
just had the fight right there no Jake

137
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,770
he's fighting Jake no I think he said he

138
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:39,870
doesn't know really Logan we're gonna

139
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,430
find out the true details and we're

140
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,810
gonna give you guys the exclusive

141
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:48,949
we're gonna find out what's the real

142
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:51,150
story here I wonder if no III think I

143
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:54,840
don't know I feel like evoke isn't Logan

144
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:56,520
way bigger than Jake I think he's like

145
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,889
considerably no I don't think that's

146
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,060
fair do you think that's fair Logan

147
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:04,139
versus Jake doesn't Jake seem way

148
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:14,759
smaller than both of them he's no wise

149
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:18,569
because you cuz the effect oh yeah yeah

150
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:20,909
anyway yeah look that up but I know that

151
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:22,830
Logan was a wrestler was Jake a wrestler

152
00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:25,409
too I'm pretty sure they both are in -

153
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:27,509
yeah some kind of like combat sport you

154
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:28,860
know wrestling or whatever I always had

155
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:30,449
this idea when I would I wanted to do a

156
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,399
Ryan tries I want to wrestle one of them

157
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:34,199
I mean they're really good they're

158
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,570
really good wrestlers there way heavier

159
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,110
I know but it's not like a serious it's

160
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,490
just

161
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,200
like just for mr. wrestle you know it's

162
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:42,720
like it'd be like fun I would watch the

163
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:45,600
hell out of that video yeah

164
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,000
but Ryan I would probably spray beat up

165
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,040
Oh to be titled Ryan tries wrestling

166
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,110
game Paul look at the Paul's the Paul

167
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,190
brothers yeah but I think I would it

168
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,230
would be better to wrestle Jake because

169
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,580
he's smaller I think like more closer to

170
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:58,110
your weight do you know can you look up

171
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,790
his weight cuz that's a big spoke with

172
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:01,800
wrestling is like a weight is a big it's

173
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:05,310
like Dean yeah because if you wrestle so

174
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,590
on even the next weight class it's it's

175
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:09,720
a pretty big disadvantage right it is

176
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:11,490
yeah it's I mean the 10 pounds or

177
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,740
whatever weight difference is sometimes

178
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,420
even as little as like 5 remember you'd

179
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,780
be like there's like a 119 weight class

180
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:20,130
and a 125 130 Wow or 132 or something

181
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,490
like that but it's like that little

182
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:25,770
amount makes a big difference so for the

183
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:27,930
boxing match Jake wall weighed in at 82

184
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:31,050
kilograms which is a hundred and eighty

185
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:33,830
pounds how do you know that the internet

186
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:37,620
saw how much is uh how much was ksi and

187
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:42,420
Logan they would be more I think there

188
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:43,680
are over 200 I thought kilograms I mean

189
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:49,080
I wouldn't be surprised there he'll must

190
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:51,470
kill so case I weighed in Oh for his

191
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:55,320
earlier fight against Joe Weller was a

192
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:58,050
182 pounds oh oh they're about the same

193
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:02,160
oh I don't know where I'm still got like

194
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:04,980
a bunch of pound yeah I guess Jake isn't

195
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,710
that much smaller than Logan there's no

196
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:11,040
guess I oh well I guess I can't wrestle

197
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:11,610
anyone then nevermind rice gum I'll

198
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,250
still do it

199
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:16,710
no I used to he's too light look him up

200
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,090
let's look him up I think he's like 140

201
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:19,740
pounds how would you know though there's

202
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:21,510
not like I'd say he's probably more than

203
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,950
that he's tall but he's skinny dude

204
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:26,010
that's true but he's pretty muscular

205
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:28,080
like is he I think so like athletic I

206
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:30,930
never seen he's good at basketball I

207
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,870
know that what says he weighs about a

208
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:36,720
hundred and forty three pounds oh don't

209
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:39,120
you dad that's not shocking friend and

210
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:43,250
he says that's with the three supreme

211
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,250
chains that he's wearing what are you

212
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,950
where are you getting that this is just

213
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,250
the Internet

214
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:55,210
okay yeah all right well what kind of

215
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,070
topics we got today

216
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:59,920
I don't know but well I'm gonna find

217
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:01,780
somebody to wrestle we're talking about

218
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,270
a lot about a YouTube drama and stuff

219
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:06,190
that's going on it's a little bit yeah

220
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:08,710
but there's actually two different

221
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:11,740
things that we can talk about which is

222
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:13,930
the Shane Dawson incident which you guys

223
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:17,680
are already familiar kind of but not

224
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:20,730
quite and there's another one this Romeo

225
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,290
Lacoste I believe was that he is a

226
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:25,750
tattoo artist oh I did hear about yeah

227
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:29,320
he's a tattoo artist he's done tattoos

228
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:33,340
for like ariana grande Dolin twins ninja

229
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:35,050
a lot more people and it's come out

230
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:38,590
where there is allegations against him

231
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:41,050
that he has been messaging girls gender

232
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:43,270
age underage girls and also we know that

233
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:45,100
this is true though like I mean has he

234
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,690
come out and defended himself here he's

235
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,100
done an interview that's defended

236
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,810
himself but with so many people coming

237
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,250
out and saying things and it's not just

238
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,470
like screen shots there's like videos of

239
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,790
it showing that he said certain we'll

240
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:58,960
say allegedly yeah that's why I said

241
00:09:54,790 --> 00:10:01,390
alleged he saw that he DM these girls

242
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,560
like really sexual stuff and at the time

243
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:05,950
those girls are like 15 or something

244
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,490
like that 14 15 I just it's still it's

245
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:11,500
so mind-boggling to me that people I

246
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:13,150
mean you still do that and have written

247
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,860
proof like don't people learn like even

248
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:17,260
like a head of files don't not saying

249
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:19,300
him specifically but how do people still

250
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:21,240
like wouldn't you know better might not

251
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,500
like that is how do you get caught right

252
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,360
like what this different one you don't

253
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,650
like if he didn't know right like he

254
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,410
didn't know what she was underage but he

255
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:30,520
said something acknowledging it like

256
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,510
something like hey do you want to wait

257
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,070
till you're 18

258
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,540
or are you more doing it now or

259
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:37,030
something like that so he acknowledges

260
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,830
that they're underage mmm but how do you

261
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,180
what goes through your head being like

262
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,260
hey this is a good idea I should write

263
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,850
something that's probably think it

264
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,510
doesn't go through the head like this is

265
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,390
a good idea

266
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:47,620
they're just that's easily thinking with

267
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:51,720
you know something else

268
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,720
it's penis I just have mental

269
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,650
[Laughter]

270
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:06,730
no I just want to push the bus you know

271
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:08,470
you can sleep you say I'll go recorded

272
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:12,220
that on the Somme board we'd never used

273
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:15,730
it but I guess there's a reason he is

274
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:17,770
thinking with that and you know it's I

275
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:20,680
mean it's a it's got to be like a mental

276
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:22,570
illness right yeah I mean I'm not trying

277
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,700
to make excuses I'm just saying it it's

278
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:26,530
there has to be something wrong to be

279
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:29,860
out or maybe just the person's like a

280
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:31,780
bad person hmm you know part of me

281
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:34,420
probably sort of like if you were

282
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:36,310
talking to a girl and even if there were

283
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,860
I mean obviously talking to underage

284
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:41,110
girls is like not okay but you don't

285
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:43,030
really think oh this person is gonna

286
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,560
like tell on me you know I mean or you

287
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:48,430
don't think of that I would think

288
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,080
because it's I mean I don't know right

289
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:52,090
but that's kind of what I think of like

290
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:57,070
when I if I'm sneaking from his point of

291
00:11:52,090 --> 00:12:00,010
view now see for wil and I we've had

292
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:02,560
experiences not maybe not directly but

293
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:04,480
we're a friend of ours or something has

294
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,390
spoken to an underage person you know

295
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,940
and and unknowingly yeah you do you do

296
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,080
well me personally knowing I didn't

297
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,340
nothing happened nothing happened though

298
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,850
whoa

299
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:19,330
we got you exclusives all right okay

300
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:20,680
what epochal do so see this is out this

301
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:24,040
is also for like my and my stand-up

302
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:27,400
stuff but basically this what do you see

303
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,810
in your head at but it was it was on

304
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,270
tinder and to be on tinder you have to

305
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:33,760
be 18 and over and so this girl on there

306
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:35,230
had her ages 19 and then so we're just

307
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,780
talking and you know it's just talking

308
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:40,030
getting to know each other and then how

309
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:42,490
old were you at the time I oh this is

310
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:44,830
like maybe a couple of months ago you're

311
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:47,320
same 8 12 8:28 okay so we're just

312
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,700
talking and then we exchanged snapchat

313
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,300
and still talking on there and then she

314
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:54,700
goes oh by the way I turn 18 next week

315
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:58,660
and then I said yikes

316
00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:01,720
and then she said don't worry the legal

317
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:04,089
age of consent in nevada is 16 and then

318
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,879
i said double yikes

319
00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:08,649
dude what so this is the scary thing cuz

320
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:09,879
what if what if you already assumed

321
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:12,100
right what how old she was

322
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:14,439
yeah and you had already said things

323
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,360
that were sexual to her yeah and then

324
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:18,759
she said that you'd still be in trouble

325
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:22,350
yeah even if you didn't know luckily I

326
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:24,910
didn't say anything though yeah no I

327
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:26,980
know but I mean that that's that's the

328
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:29,290
that's happens to people oh yeah

329
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,300
definitely it happens all the time yeah

330
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:34,329
well that's that's that's scary like I

331
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:36,309
think in your instance it was uh I mean

332
00:13:34,329 --> 00:13:38,649
you know it better so you wanna yeah I

333
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:41,350
mean it's not really my story to tell so

334
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:42,910
I mean I wasn't exactly in the situation

335
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,769
but essentially like I had a friend

336
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:48,069
growing up who yeah got in trouble and

337
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:50,649
got accused of doing stuff with younger

338
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:52,439
girls but he like pled not guilty like

339
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:55,059
he went through the whole process and

340
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:57,459
the system is kind of like set up to

341
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:59,350
like of course like favor of the victim

342
00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:01,749
in that which I guess it should be but

343
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,339
it's also like you would hope that the

344
00:14:01,749 --> 00:14:05,350
system is fair and stuff like that but

345
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:08,110
depending on which side has more

346
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:09,490
resources right more family has like

347
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,499
more money for lawyers and stuff like

348
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:14,019
that obviously that's a big difference

349
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:15,879
within the legal system and so yeah it

350
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:20,019
like completely affected his life in a

351
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:22,389
negative way and so I have at least on

352
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:23,679
my for my experiences and like my

353
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:25,809
opinions on that kind of stuff it's

354
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:27,879
affected by that yeah because he was a

355
00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:29,079
friend of mine and I obviously believe

356
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:31,480
him that he said like he didn't do

357
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:33,009
anything right and so let's just say

358
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,749
like what happens if like they're in a

359
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:36,069
bar a place that's suppose your seems to

360
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,660
be 21 and over

361
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:39,850
right and there's bouncers who are

362
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,829
supposed to check IDs now let's say that

363
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:44,019
something happens after that you know I

364
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:47,079
don't know who should be at fault I

365
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:48,639
would say I mean I know I know who is at

366
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:50,170
fault or II the person it's gonna get I

367
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,850
don't I don't think it's right but I

368
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:54,429
think the person that falls should be

369
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:56,470
the bar bar should be you know how to

370
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:58,660
accountable for letting this person fool

371
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:00,910
them and then that kid or whoever it is

372
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,170
you know using a fake ID to get in there

373
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,790
should be in trouble as well you

374
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:05,829
shouldn't just be the person who's

375
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:07,029
talking to this person unknowingly yeah

376
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:08,889
it's different from what that guy did

377
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:11,230
when he knew that that girl was underage

378
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:13,059
I think like I mean I think this

379
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:14,829
scenario I might be completely off-base

380
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:16,059
there might be a reason why I don't know

381
00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:17,560
if you guys can think of a reason why I

382
00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:19,420
just think it's not

383
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,389
it's not fair like sometimes girls or

384
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:24,310
guys even look a lot older than they are

385
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:26,439
and then it's vice versa sometimes

386
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:28,600
people look a lot younger than what how

387
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:29,860
old they are yeah so I mean it's hard to

388
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,329
say just based off looks and you're not

389
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,999
gonna go up to every person you mean be

390
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:35,860
like hey before we talk how old are you

391
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:37,660
yeah and even then it was the motion

392
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,370
illegally you're supposed to yeah and

393
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:42,660
then if it's a fake ID then what yeah

394
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:45,189
what do you do you just go to jail I

395
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:48,249
think it's different to like if you know

396
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:49,870
if he's the person that has like if the

397
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:51,730
girl right is underage and the guy has

398
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:54,790
knowledge that she's underage yeah and

399
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:55,209
the guy continues that's you're in

400
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,680
trouble

401
00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:58,600
agree you should be in trouble like if

402
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,069
you know like I don't know what this I

403
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,720
don't know anything about that situation

404
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:02,949
but if he was like oh I know you're

405
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,649
underage let's wait till you're old or

406
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:07,930
whatever and then they kept talking yeah

407
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:09,970
in that scenario supposedly in the DMS

408
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:11,709
yeah that she took video of or something

409
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:14,139
like that he said some like will you

410
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:15,999
wait well he acknowledged like do you

411
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:20,339
want to wait to you're 18 mm-hmm so he

412
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:20,339
knew yeah that's probably allegedly

413
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:26,860
around a lot allegedly

414
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:28,540
no but just because we don't get you

415
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,449
know yeah caught up in anything I

416
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:35,379
allegedly farted on this podcast did not

417
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:37,059
that's quiet anyway speaking of well the

418
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:38,500
thing is that this kind of correlates to

419
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:41,649
what we were talking about before to

420
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:44,079
where she ain't no shame show that to

421
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:45,399
Shane's incident last year about him you

422
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,529
know he had that whole pedophilia thing

423
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:49,870
cuz he made some jokes and whether it

424
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:52,290
was taken out of context or not that

425
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:54,490
happened again this week this past week

426
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:55,750
where Shane

427
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:57,069
I guess he's getting something

428
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,410
resurfaced about him saying something

429
00:16:57,069 --> 00:17:01,540
about him doing something sexual to his

430
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,439
cats or we had the quote right yeah I

431
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,919
don't know if he want to read it cuz

432
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:07,240
it's pretty it's pretty graphic but uh

433
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:08,890
it was on an episode a now-deleted

434
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:13,569
episode of Shane and Friends on

435
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:16,539
September 11th 2015 he says one time I

436
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:18,520
laid my cat down on her back ellipses I

437
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:22,299
moved her little chicken legs spread

438
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:24,789
open or whatever and I came all over the

439
00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:26,199
cat it was my first sexual experience

440
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:28,030
what was it the head nice trying to

441
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:29,770
bleep myself out there's no bleep all

442
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,360
right well and he says I was also like

443
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:33,490
19

444
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,590
but he didn't so he didn't say the

445
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:39,250
reason why there's controversies people

446
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:41,320
have pulled that clip up right and I

447
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:45,460
guess it didn't seem like he was joking

448
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:47,460
in that supposedly it seemed like a real

449
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:50,500
story like he was telling a real story

450
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:55,269
and that's what people have the base off

451
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:57,549
of it right but he for I guess in the in

452
00:17:55,269 --> 00:17:58,750
his public statement that he issued he

453
00:17:57,549 --> 00:18:00,279
was talking about how it was kind of

454
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,590
like based off an awful sketch that he

455
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:03,909
never did or anything so he did he say

456
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,039
that though in the I didn't see the

457
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:07,990
actual interview but did he say like oh

458
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:09,820
this is based off of a sketch I think it

459
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:12,610
was in the interview as a tweet oh I see

460
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:15,039
well then well I mean okay well they

461
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:16,600
need there's no context there he kind of

462
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,639
put that out there mmm

463
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:22,450
I could see why people would be upset I

464
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:24,580
mean but uh honestly I don't I don't I

465
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:26,980
know Shane that's the cut that's like

466
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,059
his comedy ya know but I don't know I

467
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,580
can see why people would take that

468
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:32,500
another way but you also said that like

469
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:35,139
gee he's been in trouble for a lot worse

470
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,149
things he said a lot worse than yes and

471
00:18:35,139 --> 00:18:38,830
he's done videos that are significantly

472
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:41,950
he doesn't make videos like that anymore

473
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:43,419
yeah but his his stuff before was pretty

474
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,559
raunchy well that was like his last

475
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:46,809
sentence was um

476
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,950
I learned my lesson and I'm more

477
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:49,389
confident now my ability to about

478
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,730
entertaining not just being myself and

479
00:18:49,389 --> 00:18:53,710
not being so shocking well that's his

480
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:56,830
apology yeah he made so he had to make

481
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:58,360
an apology for this and I granted this

482
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:00,539
is again back when he used to make those

483
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,740
kind of jokes I'm gonna assume yeah I

484
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:05,289
mean it's cons it is way different now

485
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:07,570
it is wait yeah yeah and I think that

486
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:09,880
shows like the growth in who he is and

487
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:12,730
like who you know and like how he is

488
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,470
transformed his entire brand how he has

489
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:17,019
grown is not just a content creator but

490
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,639
as a person how like you can come from a

491
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:20,440
place where a lot of people will deem it

492
00:19:18,639 --> 00:19:23,260
as like oh this is like inappropriate

493
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:25,059
and raunchy and now but the thing is it

494
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,620
always comes back to haunt you because

495
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:28,450
anything you put online will be there

496
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:30,490
forever and it's happening every single

497
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:32,019
year something is targeting Shane

498
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:34,090
because the more successful he gets the

499
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:35,139
more of a target he becomes yeah and

500
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,429
that's what really what it comes down to

501
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:38,710
and we said it before like Shane's

502
00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:42,700
killing it right now and he's made like

503
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:43,970
a very like slick transition into like

504
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,320
what his brand is now

505
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:47,930
and it's very sick he's very successful

506
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,700
and they're like Ryan said that's it now

507
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:52,280
he's an even bigger target so it's like

508
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,950
but we do have to say congratulations

509
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:57,410
right to Shane

510
00:19:53,950 --> 00:20:00,680
cuz you got engaged oh yeah yeah for

511
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:04,820
what the cat forget I shoulda got

512
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:05,990
engaged Congrats to Shane um but yeah

513
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,000
that's kind of unfortunate that that's

514
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:10,400
happening right now when he announced

515
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,790
that engagement yeah so um do you guys

516
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:16,040
feel that there should be a time period

517
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:18,230
of like after five years certain tweets

518
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,660
are like you know you should let those

519
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:23,360
go to eliminations you're like

520
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:24,710
presenters kind of yeah like if you

521
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,840
commit certain crimes after a certain

522
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,800
amount of time you can't be charged for

523
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,290
them you're smart

524
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:32,030
what do you mean such okay well I mean

525
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:34,430
there's certain things certain crimes

526
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,480
that have that yeah murder is not one of

527
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:37,880
them yeah

528
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,650
I can't murder someone and then 20 years

529
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,170
later you're good yeah if they find out

530
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:47,420
you're still you know yeah I think at

531
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:50,570
least so tweets um I think I personally

532
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:53,930
think it never will be that way but it

533
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:56,090
should be because things change a lot

534
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:59,090
agreed Society changes and you change

535
00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:01,490
yeah like so like in memory in the in

536
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:04,400
the how to be ninja video we used the FA

537
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:06,470
G word yeah and that wasn't targeted at

538
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,880
gay people yeah it had a different

539
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:13,670
meaning for me growing up you know in in

540
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,640
Hawaii specifically saying that word not

541
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:18,620
that I would even say it now saying that

542
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,320
word had a different meaning in that it

543
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:24,140
wasn't even necessarily it didn't mean

544
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,370
gay it was like a homophobic slur no no

545
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,690
no it just meant it was just like

546
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:28,370
something you said to your friends to

547
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:31,160
make fun of your friends but it wasn't

548
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:34,070
meant gay it became like a it was more

549
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:35,810
like Ave action like how you acted no

550
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:37,940
like an adjective

551
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:40,100
yeah and then people just associated the

552
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,660
two and it became well this I'm just

553
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,340
saying from Hawaii didn't differ your

554
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,660
point of view yeah the way we grew up

555
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,790
people used to sit and it wasn't like

556
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:48,050
you could say that before you know gay

557
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,400
people used to say that we talked about

558
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:51,470
yes they used to say that to you

559
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,390
thanks man well I mean everybody use I

560
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,890
mean it wasn't like it was like another

561
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:57,440
it wasn't a good word it was still an

562
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:59,180
insult yeah but it didn't mean gay

563
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,670
it was a gay and that word was

564
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:04,190
completely different very you took that

565
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:07,250
down right there's that video we have it

566
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:09,020
it was down yeah and then I think it

567
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:11,570
might be blocked something like that

568
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:14,930
yeah unlisted or something like that but

569
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:16,970
but that's part of you growing out okay

570
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:19,610
yeah I'd know better I've already said I

571
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:23,120
apologized for it like I didn't know

572
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:25,040
back then I was 16 and even then like it

573
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,930
was a different time yeah I wouldn't

574
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,430
make that video now I mean not like that

575
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:32,150
you know we even called it out in

576
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:33,680
another video so I think yeah I mean I

577
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,660
think things change over time something

578
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,450
like I said last time something we're

579
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:39,770
saying right now could become something

580
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:43,670
offensive in five to ten years from now

581
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:45,320
yeah Oh exactly we don't know yet it's

582
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:48,950
one of those things where obviously

583
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:50,810
there's like a limit of like how bad is

584
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,490
the tweet all right then it's gonna be

585
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:54,410
like then that kind of determines I

586
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:57,050
think like obviously if you say

587
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:59,900
something super racist on Twitter ten

588
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:01,970
years ago you should probably have to

589
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:03,380
explain it yeah like no matter what you

590
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:05,180
should be like even if it's something

591
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,740
like well I was racist back then you

592
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:08,810
know I'm saying like yeah now I'm not

593
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:11,120
like now I've learned I've changed you

594
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:13,460
think people do you think people that

595
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,890
that have had that change and did

596
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,480
realized a mistake should still be you

597
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:20,810
know attacked for what they did in the

598
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,910
past even if they acknowledge it mmm no

599
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:25,370
I don't think yeah I don't think so

600
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:28,250
there's actually I saw there's mini

601
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:31,970
documentary about how this former like

602
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:36,350
races and like we say racist a lot that

603
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:40,330
we did we do but this guy who used to be

604
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:44,330
like a white supremacist no word babies

605
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:46,220
but he realized that his actions turned

606
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:48,080
around and started and he was a tattoo

607
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,570
artist and he would change people's

608
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,910
tattoos who that used to have like oh

609
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:55,550
that's like white supremists meanings

610
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:57,170
and stuff and and changed yeah and and

611
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,790
make it into something entirely new

612
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:00,740
that's so for people who wanted

613
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:02,150
Redemption yeah yeah and so that's like

614
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,430
a good story now if people were like

615
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,960
whoa but you're races and little and

616
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:07,760
just like attacking what people could

617
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,440
yeah people say he became big enough

618
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,090
like he became the next PewDiePie yeah

619
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,639
like that's how popular I guess

620
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:15,200
- you people would protest him mmm it

621
00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:17,059
would say stop supporting this guy just

622
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,269
because he's he's taking advantage of

623
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:22,159
what you know you used to do he he would

624
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:23,149
get attacked I'm 100% sure that that for

625
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,649
sure but then those people are just

626
00:24:23,149 --> 00:24:26,870
stupid idiots are they though they're

627
00:24:24,649 --> 00:24:30,019
mad that's what I'm asking that like

628
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:32,419
those types of people yeah oh my thank

629
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:34,460
you - but I'm just saying I mean grab my

630
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:36,769
sleeve it's it would happen if that guy

631
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,629
even if he means you know he's he

632
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:39,830
acknowledges he apologizes he's even

633
00:24:38,629 --> 00:24:42,019
making up for it in what he does it

634
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:44,779
becomes as famous as a PewDiePie anyone

635
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:47,119
even a shame he is gonna get attacked

636
00:24:44,779 --> 00:24:48,230
for sure he's sorry for what he did and

637
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,769
there's gonna be people trying to take

638
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,419
him down

639
00:24:48,769 --> 00:24:52,549
yeah and it's only because of his

640
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:54,169
popularity but that doesn't mean that

641
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:56,389
those people are right yes they're gonna

642
00:24:54,169 --> 00:24:57,889
do that but those people are morons

643
00:24:56,389 --> 00:25:00,470
that's I agree with that yeah because

644
00:24:57,889 --> 00:25:01,309
that is like a huge part of changing the

645
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:03,159
world for the better

646
00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:05,570
yeah as cheesy as corny as that sounds

647
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:07,730
taking the people that think a certain

648
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:10,070
way that's like super bad right yeah

649
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:12,049
white supremacists and then 10 years

650
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:14,749
later they're not and they've changed

651
00:25:12,049 --> 00:25:16,580
yeah you absolutely want to praise that

652
00:25:14,749 --> 00:25:18,740
person for making that change yes you do

653
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:20,330
not want to attacked him for what they

654
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:22,009
used to believe you know I'm saying

655
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:24,649
because that's important it's like

656
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:26,809
changing vote but coming from not saying

657
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:27,860
that I agree but coming from a different

658
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:30,440
perspective right

659
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:32,059
that guy becomes that powerful and you

660
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,529
you know you don't think that person

661
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:35,179
should have that power because of their

662
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:36,320
past and the way that they used to think

663
00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:38,779
because you don't trust how they think

664
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,220
wouldn't you want to say stop this stop

665
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:43,369
this guy you don't want him to have

666
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:45,860
influence yeah okay well then why can't

667
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:47,360
that guy become president that no really

668
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:49,399
it would allow him to become president

669
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,230
what his past being that I think the

670
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:53,690
thing for me what I would see is like

671
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:55,610
right oh this guy has had a bad past

672
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:57,440
right he's aware of it he's admitted to

673
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:58,940
it and that shows a lot more morals and

674
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,379
Bowser and a lot of the people who are

675
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,669
like look at how perfect I am it's just

676
00:26:00,379 --> 00:26:03,679
like no you're not perfect you're just

677
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:06,049
really good at hiding your your real

678
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,639
past or true intentions or however

679
00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:10,820
you've been you know because everybody

680
00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:13,159
has that that sense of like evil and

681
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:15,169
then we're human we naturally have evil

682
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:18,919
tendencies we're very selfish creatures

683
00:26:15,169 --> 00:26:21,679
and to be able to that evil though what

684
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:22,639
being selfish a little bit I mean

685
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,890
everybody is selfish

686
00:26:22,639 --> 00:26:27,650
please evil but we have yeah that's why

687
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:31,190
everybody has like natural evil in them

688
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:33,740
but to be able to be like okay I this is

689
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:37,100
my past this is what happened but now I

690
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:40,250
want to move forward and use how I

691
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:42,020
overcame this situation to inspire other

692
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,700
people and show like there's a lot

693
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,590
better to life and how we should be

694
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:48,140
treating people in a positive and humane

695
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:49,580
matter that that type of person I would

696
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:52,130
be a lot more like oh I know more about

697
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:54,800
him I can't relate to this I can respect

698
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:55,400
that then someone who is like this is

699
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,080
what I want

700
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,280
I'm perfection and all this because I'm

701
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,570
like that's not attainable you're a

702
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,730
lying you're lying somewhere could be

703
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:04,160
when what you're saying is people maybe

704
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:05,630
just don't believe that they've made an

705
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,310
honest change that's what I mean yeah

706
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:08,870
that's I mean because and that's up

707
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:10,700
that's totally up to them I mean whether

708
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:12,320
or not they believe them or not is is up

709
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,000
to the own is it yeah this goes back to

710
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,290
PewDiePie and you see the comments to

711
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,090
where people still call them out like oh

712
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:18,440
how can you support a white supremacist

713
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:20,990
or someone who said the n-word or

714
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,570
whatever and whether you apologized for

715
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:25,040
it or not and I mean he did there's

716
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:27,290
always gonna be those people yeah right

717
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:29,090
but you're slowly starting to see people

718
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:32,750
be like okay well he acknowledged it

719
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:33,860
like reasonable people right and you

720
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:35,300
know when you really break down what he

721
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,640
did honey we're not gonna get into that

722
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,240
anyway but those people are always gonna

723
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,470
be there

724
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,300
yeah and if you but if you think about

725
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:43,310
it it's not a minority like if you think

726
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:45,230
about a different situation like say a

727
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:47,000
president or candidate right someone

728
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,140
running for president you find out that

729
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,260
this person used to be a white

730
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:53,150
supremacist or a racist or whatever they

731
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:54,800
did something really bad in the past and

732
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:58,280
all of us and they acknowledge it right

733
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:59,660
that person never will win yeah he would

734
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:02,150
never become president but I will say

735
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:03,590
there's a difference in finding out that

736
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:05,330
this person has that oh but what if he

737
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:07,130
acknowledges it from the start if you

738
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:09,710
presents in Malia or someone even have a

739
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:10,340
chance I could say so yeah you think so

740
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,690
I think so

741
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:13,610
alright then maybe there's a new

742
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,650
strategy for some presidential candidate

743
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:17,570
there just come on the podcast and we'll

744
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:19,580
teach you our techniques to winning the

745
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:21,530
presidency Paco seems to know a lot

746
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:23,480
i I agree with you I think that would be

747
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:26,150
super interesting I think this is a very

748
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,010
honest person exactly but in the eyes of

749
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:29,540
other people would they be like well why

750
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:31,250
would I take this guy when there's this

751
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:35,140
other guy who would like you said we

752
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:35,140
know he's not perfect but on paper he is

753
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:41,279
I don't have an answer I don't I'm just

754
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,630
like trying to give another perspective

755
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,700
I'm not even saying I agree with that

756
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:46,380
I'm just trying to see like from another

757
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,940
from their perspective I mean of course

758
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,620
their policies would matter and

759
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,909
everything but on him but say it was

760
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,620
exactly the same and you had a guy with

761
00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:54,929
a past who acknowledges it versus a guy

762
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:56,730
who is perfect on paper but you know

763
00:28:54,929 --> 00:29:01,559
their stuff you just would never find

764
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:03,450
out I'm a I would honestly be pretty

765
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:05,220
stuck between the two I might pick the

766
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:09,350
guy like with more flaws in the back

767
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:12,630
history just because it he shows growth

768
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:15,029
he shows a lot of growth you know and

769
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:17,039
for that type of growth in somebody I

770
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:19,350
don't see why they can't inspire other

771
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:21,899
people around them to be able to push

772
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:23,970
through there they're hard issues in

773
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:25,590
life yeah I mean I don't think there has

774
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:27,269
ever been like a candidate that that

775
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:28,380
came out and said I used to be this and

776
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:29,820
now I'm this and be like super

777
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,370
vulnerable in that sense I don't know if

778
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:34,080
that would have the would be was Obama

779
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:36,120
saying that he smoked weed before I

780
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,010
don't know if they found that out or he

781
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,779
just said oh yeah I smoked weed in

782
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:41,730
college like I don't know if that was

783
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:44,370
like - because weed was a hot topic and

784
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:51,240
like I'm not that's true right that's

785
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:52,500
what he said I I might be lying I don't

786
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,909
know I think that's like then and that's

787
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,289
super relatable people were like and

788
00:29:53,909 --> 00:29:56,970
then people were okay with weed and he

789
00:29:55,289 --> 00:29:59,399
said this is another thing had you said

790
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:00,960
that maybe ten years ago 15 let's say 15

791
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:02,789
years ago he would be like oh my god

792
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,559
he's a drug addict yeah no weed wasn't

793
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:07,860
seen the same way as it is today yeah

794
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:10,769
that's for sure right well I think it

795
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:12,899
comes down to the it's like the

796
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:14,639
whoever's believed the listening or

797
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:16,260
whoever's listening whether or not they

798
00:30:14,639 --> 00:30:17,880
believe it or not it's like kind of you

799
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:20,399
can transition into like the MJ story

800
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:22,260
right or like whatever that was do you

801
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:25,440
guys watch the documentary I did not

802
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:26,250
I've read about it well I didn't watch

803
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,230
it yeah

804
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:29,970
because it comes out of like what you

805
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:32,730
believe like whose story yeah because

806
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:34,380
you know facts aside or whether or not

807
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:36,299
there are facts or are not facts it's

808
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:38,279
like this person says this this person

809
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:39,990
says this so yeah it's like it's up to

810
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:41,669
the person to believe like I know I

811
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:43,260
should watch it because I should be

812
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:45,720
up-to-date on those things I just really

813
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:47,429
don't want to yeah because and it's just

814
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,289
a personal thing yeah I just don't want

815
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:50,530
to root like I know it's like oh that's

816
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:52,840
sort your response but like

817
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:55,150
I don't know like I said I should watch

818
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:58,150
it but I just don't want to ruin my

819
00:30:55,150 --> 00:31:00,700
vision of what I currently see yeah and

820
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:02,920
I think that is you can call that

821
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:04,150
whatever it is but I mean I also like

822
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:07,900
you said it's coming from someone's

823
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:10,300
story it's not yeah he's not the venoms

824
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:16,720
of either so that's just that's unfair

825
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:21,910
yeah I should probably watch it nothing

826
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:23,830
is I'm probably much Oh we see she

827
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:25,660

used to I know but now I mean I'm not a

889
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,630
hundred percent of polls I just don't

890
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:13,210
know what I would do

891
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:21,160

like when we did ytf and toured and

898
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:34,540
stuff I was just the host like that's

899
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,530
not hard to do just get the crowd for

900
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:39,040
the real talent

901
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:41,860
what you do in Manila then I did like a

902
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:46,840
very poor version of a song that people

903
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:48,940
know that's it you danced as well yeah

904
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:51,610
but it's not like Rio dancing it's like

905
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:53,560
watching very very very amateur people

906
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:55,810
do very very amateur singing and dancing

907
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:58,030
but it's because it's us it's better

908
00:34:55,810 --> 00:35:00,100
than nothing you know that's how people

909
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:02,230
see it oh at least they're trying but

910
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,600
it's awful like it's it's but it's bad

911
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:06,340
like I mean our performances were bad in

912
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,800
comparison to real dancers and real

913
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:11,050
singers it was better but very close to

914
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,880
nothing yes yeah but it is better than

915
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:15,250
nothing it's like at least which it's

916
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,470
better than us just coming out and doing

917
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:18,640
nothing yeah I think that's why I wanted

918
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:20,500
to do it

919
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:25,120
and it's like kind of like schizo we do

920
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:27,100
like Live skits away but yeah I'm not

921
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,540
I'm not a performer you are you doing I

922
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:31,210
mean like to do stuff like that yeah

923
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:33,100
because I need attention and that's all

924
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:35,860
what I'm fueled off of but I want

925
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:38,500
attention attention too but that's what

926
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:42,490
drives me and this tiny thing I have but

927
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:44,500
for you if you if you could do something

928
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:46,180
I guess what would you like to do if you

929
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,400
had the ability to show yeah yeah

930
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:51,190
honestly I've always wanted to do like a

931
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:54,280
I mean not just my stuff I would want to

932
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:56,770
coordinate some a show like 8:00 like if

933
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:59,440
I had dancers and I had singers and make

934
00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:03,370
make us basically a long video mm-hmm

935
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,810
but live mmm this is a place behind a

936
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,640
kind of but like in using different

937
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:08,830
talents I wouldn't personally want to be

938
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,380
in it director kind of like a director

939
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:12,820
writer I guess and then kind of okay I

940
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,140
have this talent and I have this talent

941
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,580
and this time how can I make this all

942
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:17,260
work and then make it like epic at the

943
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:18,760
end and you know like follow a video

944
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,290
thing where you build up something plan

945
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,880
things in the beginning have them like

946
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:23,770
slowly water it and then pay off at the

947
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,900
end like I don't know I just think

948
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:27,250
that's fun that part of it not me

949
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:30,460
actually being in in do you like

950
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:32,620
musicals mmm it depends depends I don't

951
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:34,540
I never used to but it depends I like

952
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:37,540
the ones that have actual story and it's

953
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:40,630
not just for the sake of singing yeah so

954
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:43,630
like have you seen wicked no where's

955
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:45,760
that it's I like a spin-off of Wizard of

956
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:47,350
Oz oh but it's like from the witches

957
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,890
perspective and stuff it's actually

958
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:51,040
pretty good

959
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:53,590

1041
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,190
is it no he's dancing in a show so he

1042
00:40:19,779 --> 00:40:27,489
had to be what he was gone for a week

1043
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:28,960
and then Sean was gone for life no shot

1044
00:40:27,489 --> 00:40:30,579
well not that we couldn't do it without

1045
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:34,269
him because we have like even like Park

1046
00:40:30,579 --> 00:40:36,549
horses only five people hmm oh four five

1047
00:40:34,269 --> 00:40:39,729
five people it's been so long it's dead

1048
00:40:36,549 --> 00:40:42,069
I know I can already forgot but we do

1049
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:44,289
need to do a tee time because we have a

1050
00:40:42,069 --> 00:40:45,729
lot of stuff that stuff filed we do have

1051
00:40:44,289 --> 00:40:47,469
to do that I'm down to do a part course

1052
00:40:45,729 --> 00:40:50,469
for a while I couldn't because I had

1053
00:40:47,469 --> 00:40:52,509
ankle issues from basketball but I think

1054
00:40:50,469 --> 00:40:54,249
I'm good now injuries definitely played

1055
00:40:52,509 --> 00:40:55,719
a pretty big like par course you need to

1056
00:40:54,249 --> 00:40:58,420
be like physically ready ready

1057
00:40:55,719 --> 00:41:00,099
dude I'm winning the next one you always

1058
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:03,009
say that now I'm confident this time

1059
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:04,390
anyway the first time Paco was on par

1060
00:41:03,009 --> 00:41:07,239
course I think what episode was at the

1061
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:09,339
bridge one though on the pond was the

1062
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:10,719
bridge or played one yeah when he jumped

1063
00:41:09,339 --> 00:41:12,819
over a little river thing yeah yeah

1064
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:14,559
whatever episode that was Paco before

1065
00:41:12,819 --> 00:41:16,119
that this is before he did any part

1066
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:18,430
course he would just watch them and I

1067
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:20,680
think on video it looks a lot easier so

1068
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:22,539
he was just like he was so confident

1069
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,999
yeah and he was like we should we should

1070
00:41:22,539 --> 00:41:26,680
have bet him because he I knew he could

1071
00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:27,849
there are certain things that you just

1072
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,739
it's harder than it looks

1073
00:41:27,849 --> 00:41:31,479
I'm wearing shoes next time okay yeah

1074
00:41:29,739 --> 00:41:33,130
that's the problem you got out the first

1075
00:41:31,479 --> 00:41:34,569
one I was the first one I ran into a

1076
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:37,539
water those that don't know Park horse

1077
00:41:34,569 --> 00:41:39,549
is our series where we do parkour but

1078
00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:42,099
it's our version like it's it's not

1079
00:41:39,549 --> 00:41:43,390
parkour yeah we do stunts but it's like

1080
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:45,640
horse so like if someone does something

1081
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:47,440
then the next person follows I like that

1082
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:49,479
series it's just I for a long time I was

1083
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,249
hurt and then you know not everybody was

1084
00:41:49,479 --> 00:41:53,289
around I read by people did a good way

1085
00:41:51,249 --> 00:41:55,420
to describe it is that it's not nothing

1086
00:41:53,289 --> 00:41:58,360
it's a little bit better than nothing

1087
00:41:55,420 --> 00:42:00,100
it's amateur people doing parkour

1088
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:04,540
the other thing is when we made it we

1089
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:07,330
were like 21 and now we're almost 31 so

1090
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:10,870
what yeah not us

1091
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:12,850
well I mean on average yeah 29 you know

1092
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:16,210
well we did it I think the first thing

1093
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:17,860
we did in Australia which is me Greg and

1094
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:20,050
you Greg and Sean John yeah and we were

1095
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:21,700
just you always had the idea but we'd

1096
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:23,620
never did it we just bore we're in we're

1097
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:25,480
at a show where I was doing something

1098
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:26,950
like hosting and we were in the green

1099
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,390
room for like six hours or something

1100
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:30,100
like that we had time to kill so we just

1101
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:30,790
started turning on the camera stuff we

1102
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,710
already did

1103
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:34,180
mm-hmm but yeah that show did really

1104
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:36,010
well yeah we should probably do one did

1105
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:38,230
I made a best of parkour video for you

1106
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:39,820
to post its but that's just like the

1107
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:41,710
same stuff people have seen yeah but

1108
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:44,440
that's like a good a it's coming back

1109
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:49,270
okay well we'll do a trailer then how

1110
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:51,760
about that make it a trailer yeah

1111
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:53,350
well Greg willing Greg is it is it dead

1112
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,460
it's probably dead I don't know we're

1113
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:58,240
gonna make it

1114
00:42:54,460 --> 00:43:00,460
maybe wild card is dead maybe no is it

1115
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:03,880
coming back big into that zone I don't

1116
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:05,740
know cooking but not really I could see

1117
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,570
us making that probably more than any

1118
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:09,790
other ones yeah actually when Shawn was

1119
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:13,120
here visiting he we were like going to

1120
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:14,950
do it but then he we only thought of it

1121
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,420
on the last day this no it isn't gonna

1122
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:18,100
take all day those takes so much longer

1123
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,990
than people think because we don't know

1124
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:21,760
what we're gonna do to that day yeah so

1125
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:24,790
half the day is me and Shawn just like

1126
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:28,180
hey what if we did like a burrito

1127
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:30,070
but it's pizza like that's right yeah

1128
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:32,320
most times it's not something that we

1129
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:33,940
that's good like the one time we did

1130
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:36,370
that one for Shawn like I got the

1131
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:37,900
experience whatever you like it's ours 2

1132
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:39,610
to 3 hours with us just sitting there

1133
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,930
like what should we do yeah as a cos

1134
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:44,380
this relate to short like you know it's

1135
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:46,960
it's a lot yeah it's it's genuine I mean

1136
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:48,610
it's not fake like we don't like we do

1137
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,290
it for real yeah so it's not like us

1138
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:52,510
like we're not pretending like we're not

1139
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:54,790
coming up with it on the spot

1140
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:57,160
TV time you already said yep tee time

1141
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:58,870
again I dare you we do it just now

1142
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:01,150
there's so many rules on YouTube

1143
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:02,680
everything I all the I dare use most of

1144
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:05,320
the I dare use that I put up got

1145
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:07,000
demonetised or age-restricted because

1146
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,800
it's like dangerous things or gross

1147
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,270
things so it's like it's tough I mean

1148
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,680
I'll still probably I'm still open to

1149
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:12,130
doing them yeah it's just we make

1150
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,660
nothing

1151
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:18,700
off of them so unless SeatGeek wants to

1152
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:20,560
as well it's pretty hard to do it and

1153
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:22,960
commit to it something that you are

1154
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:26,320
probably gonna lose money off yeah oh

1155
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:29,290
yeah it's a big umbrella answer for this

1156
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:31,240
is as a good time schedules lining up

1157
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:33,310
because Derek coming back healthy

1158
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:35,140
Rebecca having everyone available one

1159
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:37,480
day you know that's pretty rare so it's

1160
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:39,430
we need we'll bring it back and we need

1161
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:41,230
to start some new stuff too yeah some

1162
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:45,610
new shows cuz it get tired of doing the

1163
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:49,600
same stuff yeah um next question from

1167
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:56,590
little bit but it's kind of like where

1168
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:59,110
if somebody says something or it gets

1169
00:44:56,590 --> 00:45:00,850
brought up from their past every uh that

1170
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:02,560
all Twitter will just be like oh this

1171
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:03,700

1173
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:07,810
so we already touched okay and this does

1174
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,120
that come from like if you get a show

are maybe outside of YouTube Oh an

1192
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:55,510
example hobbies skills or places to miss

1193
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:57,160
well go ahead you seem excited I mean I

1194
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:59,230
have a lot of hobbies as you know you

1195
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:02,130
have too many hobbies one that was like

1196
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:04,960
actually a realization for me was um

1197
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:07,180
it's like so weird and random another

1198
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:10,180
thing you guys know this but it was I

1199
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:12,040
was traveling I think it might have been

1200
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:14,410
coming back from twitchcon and I was in

1201
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:17,590
the airport and I saw someone who was a

1202
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:20,050
dog handler like you know like they like

1203
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:21,310
she's you know sniffing for security

1204
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:23,230
person security person but they have a

1205
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:25,650
dog and I was like yeah I think I could

1206
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:28,619
do that yeah you have a dog and I really

1207
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:30,990
like working with dogs on that like like

1208
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:32,369
that level of training them and like

1209
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:33,869
having giving them something they feel

1210
00:46:32,369 --> 00:46:37,619
fulfilled you know and like giving them

1211
00:46:33,869 --> 00:46:39,690
the work and stuff and but will it ever

1212
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:42,059
happen I don't know probably probably

1213
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:44,160
not cuz that's like a huge commitment

1214
00:46:42,059 --> 00:46:46,049
yeah I have to be super like educated

1215
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,430
and a lot of I think a lot of people in

1216
00:46:46,049 --> 00:46:49,799
that field are usually probably like

1217
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:51,950
ex-military or you know police police

1218
00:46:49,799 --> 00:46:55,079
work and stuff like that but I think as

1219
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:57,059
like a random career hobby thing that

1220
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:59,069
I'll be really interested in oddly

1221
00:46:57,059 --> 00:47:02,039
enough that is kind of it for me that's

1222
00:46:59,069 --> 00:47:03,779
really specific I remember seeing it and

1223
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:05,430
go because they were working with a new

1224
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:07,920
dog and that's why they were actually

1225
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:09,329
actively training and so um I was

1226
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,059
looking I was like man that looks really

1227
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:13,470
cool and like fulfilling and fun and and

1228
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:14,460
then it's just one of those realizations

1229
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:15,930
that you see something and you're like

1230
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:23,160
yeah I think you could do that kind of

1231
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:25,109
thing how about you man you have a lot

1232
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,520
of I have a lot of things you're I love

1233
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:29,250
myself as weird you're one of those

1234
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:31,650
people that you get really excited about

1235
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:33,869
something and you put so much effort

1236
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:35,819
into it and then something else comes up

1237
00:47:33,869 --> 00:47:37,619
and then you put so much effort into it

1238
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:39,779
and then sometimes you bounce back to

1239
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:42,869
those things and you put so much effort

1240
00:47:39,779 --> 00:47:44,730
into it and I'm kind of like at you

1241
00:47:42,869 --> 00:47:45,839
jumping around yeah I'm kind of like

1242
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:46,289
that as well like you want to be a

1243
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,549
rapper

1244
00:47:46,289 --> 00:47:49,619
at one point no I didn't want to be a

1245
00:47:47,549 --> 00:47:49,950
rapper oh what I just did it cuz it's

1246
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:51,630
fun

1247
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:53,250
oh okay well then you want to do

1248
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:55,020
stand-up which you have been putting

1249
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:56,339

can meet Joe Rogan and be on his podcast

1328
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:05,580
I think you could do well you just don't

1329
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,910

1330
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:06,930
good

1331
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:09,750
you just don't believe in yourself that

1332
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:13,440
way yeah this goes back to the beginning

1333
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:15,030
of the podcast I don't believe I think

1334
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,800
you could I think you're good at writing

1335
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:20,880
jokes and you could figure out a way to

1336
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:22,850
deliver them in like I don't know you

1337
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,420
know what it is though have bad memory

1338
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:26,190
that's also true

1339
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:27,600
I would you spend on a lotta time but

1340
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:28,440
you could make it like a thing where

1341
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,450
you're just like sitting up there

1342
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:33,300
reading jokes you know that's like could

1343
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:49,670
be a thing all right yeah I mean jokes

1344
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:51,720

1358
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:25,860
handful of things like I just a general

1359
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:28,620
audience comedy oh but I don't like fake

1360
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:30,510
movie trailers like music videos like

1361
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:32,370

okay why I don't know it just feels

1365
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:40,680
weird when people say oh tell me a joke

1366
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:42,390
like if I they're like oh what do you do

1367
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:44,550
I like comedy stuff and they told me a

1368
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:48,330
joke then really it's so awkward why

1369
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:53,910
don't you just say no knock-knock joke

1370
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:57,450
Rogen laughs tell them that go away it's

1371
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:58,890
a good one it's pretty bad hmm okay what

1372
00:52:57,450 --> 00:53:01,680
were you saying you saying what would

1373
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:03,390
you do outside of YouTube Oh outside of

1374
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,340
YouTube well that's it has closed the

1375
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:06,720
question even I forgot what's off top do

1376
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:08,310
you have any goals or names

1377
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,810
to accomplish some time in the law in

1378
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:11,700
your lives which are maybe outside of

1379
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:14,700
YouTube papi skills be a UFC fighter

1380
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:17,910
really I mean if I if I was like 10

1381
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:20,369
years younger and I I'd get into YouTube

1382
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:22,050
or and I dropped out of college and I

1383
00:53:20,369 --> 00:53:23,700
was like damn I got nothing I would

1384
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:25,349
start training you wouldn't be a fighter

1385
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:27,720
I think they're talking about right now

1386
00:53:25,349 --> 00:53:30,810
about likewise I still would want to be

1387
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:31,619
a fighter now because I know what else

1388
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:33,900
we're gonna do

1389
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:36,270
dog handling but I would like that a

1390
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:37,590
career wise so yeah I know I'm what

1391
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:40,109
wouldn't be I mean I would love to be a

1392
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:42,060
NBA basketball player too short and I

1393
00:53:40,109 --> 00:53:43,680
fast enough can't shoot three I can't

1394
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:45,090
jump yeah my wrist is bro I would

1395
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,310
probably have to rebreathe my wrist my

1396
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:50,849
wrist can actually grow my shooting form

1397
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:51,810
yeah but since that's not realistic can

1398
00:53:50,849 --> 00:53:57,840
you get out of a wrist grab

1399
00:53:51,810 --> 00:54:01,920
oh no for the listeners will grab yeah

1400
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:04,950
and then he hurt me sorry I would do I

1401
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:06,810
mean I I I would love to learn how to

1402
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:09,300
fight yeah well yeah I mean I like

1403
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:10,680
combats well I do yeah I mean I grew up

1404
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:14,190
doing judo my whole life and then

1405
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:16,770
wrestling and I dabbled in jiu-jitsu and

1406
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:18,210
it's just fun it's not even like a

1407
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:20,190
matter of like wanting to beat someone

1408
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:23,130
up it's just knowing like it's just a

1409
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:27,210
very it so it pushes you so hard to the

1410
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:29,339
point that you feel excellent after yeah

1411
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:30,480
it's just a weird feeling after you get

1412
00:54:29,339 --> 00:54:32,280
done with a session and you're just like

1413
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,650
at the brink of like man I would rather

1414
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:36,000
die than keep going if you haven't felt

1415
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:37,619
that it feels so good when you're done

1416
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,300
yeah I don't know it's just a good

1417
00:54:37,619 --> 00:54:43,020
feeling put you in a better mood

1418
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:46,349
well so yeah just spider Wow

1419
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:48,750

of here do you agree all your sleeve I

1421
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:54,450

would like to do MMA but Mike I don't

1442
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:49,980
it's it's tough because I don't want to

00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,600
hurt somebody

1444
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:53,940

00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:55,800
to get hurt you know like really met you

1446
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:57,150

like I said if I wasn't doing YouTube

1448
00:55:57,150 --> 00:56:02,010

1456
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:23,850
hurting them cuz you're expecting to get

1483
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,650
because people asked where you were I

1484
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:32,079

he'll be like it's not really late but

1488
00:57:39,429 --> 00:57:42,549
for me it's just like when you're trying

1489
00:57:41,079 --> 00:57:44,410
to do be able to do something on your

1490
00:57:42,549 --> 00:57:46,150
own with your own type of branding and

1491
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:49,209
stuff and to always be constantly

1492
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:50,859

1509
00:58:21,339 --> 00:58:29,319

00:58:30,579 --> 00:58:34,660
no I don't get annoyed because I just

1513
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:36,640
don't answer it we also don't look at

1514
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:38,769
social media what do you mean you know

1515
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:42,160
look all the time what question just

1516
00:58:38,769 --> 00:58:44,140
don't always respond yeah I look all the

1517
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,849
time I don't know I honestly cannot

1518
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:49,959
think of one like specifically that

1519
00:58:45,849 --> 00:58:52,269
annoys me mm-hmm all right this is from

1520
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:54,130
Vanessa specifically to you well how did

1521
00:58:52,269 --> 00:58:57,099
you meet your girlfriend Monica oh you

1522
00:58:54,130 --> 00:59:00,519
talked about this oh I don't think so so

1523
00:58:57,099 --> 00:59:02,769
how so we had a group of step boys we

1524
00:59:00,519 --> 00:59:06,160
talked about that last podcast before to

1525
00:59:02,769 --> 00:59:09,609
to last one with us yeah and then Dom

1526
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:11,319
Dietrich so when I was like 16 they

1527
00:59:09,609 --> 00:59:13,449
started going to a gymnastics place and

1528
00:59:11,319 --> 00:59:15,519
that's the one that Monica's parents

1529
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:18,369
owned they owned a gymnastics place and

1530
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:20,709
its really pretty common or she's really

1531
00:59:18,369 --> 00:59:22,749
fortunate for breakers to be able to go

1532
00:59:20,709 --> 00:59:24,939
to a gymnastic Center and work on stuff

1533
00:59:22,749 --> 00:59:27,759
because you can work on flips you can do

1534
00:59:24,939 --> 00:59:30,549
stuff in a setting that you won't get

1535
00:59:27,759 --> 00:59:31,959
super hurt right yeah yeah and so that

1536
00:59:30,549 --> 00:59:33,969
was like a big deal so we started like

1537
00:59:31,959 --> 00:59:36,189
going there and then Dom actually

1538
00:59:33,969 --> 00:59:39,099
started talking to Monica well I think I

1539
00:59:36,189 --> 00:59:40,779
was 16 I was really young how old is how

1540
00:59:39,099 --> 00:59:42,369
old is Monica they were at the time I

1541
00:59:40,779 --> 00:59:44,559
mean she's only a couple years older

1542
00:59:42,369 --> 00:59:45,700
yeah a few years older I was 16 or 17 so

1543
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:49,150
we were kids

1544
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:52,330
and then so that was how she kind of

1545
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:53,890
like knew everyone was like she started

1546
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:55,780
hanging out with the actual breakdancing

1547
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:57,850
crew yeah which was what Dom was in and

1548
00:59:55,780 --> 01:00:02,040
she was in their crew she was in a

1549
00:59:57,850 --> 01:00:02,040
better way better dancer than I was and

1550
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,940
yeah so that's basically how she kind of

1551
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:09,120
came into like our group of friends and

1552
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:11,590
that many many many many years later

1553
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:13,660
they had like dated for just a little

1554
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:17,290
while and then separated and then kind

1555
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:19,600
of we started going there right and then

1556
01:00:17,290 --> 01:00:21,550
Dom went to LA and became superstar and

1557
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:24,070
became famous and then we we were

1558
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:26,170
luckily able to use her dance place

1559
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:28,060
right for because we didn't have that

1560
01:00:26,170 --> 01:00:31,330
much money we needed a place to practice

1561
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:33,100
and so we started going there and then I

1562
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:36,550
don't remember it was like someone's

1563
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:39,730
birthday we went out and we just kind of

1564
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:42,040
made out started talking and then I was

1565
01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:49,630
like and I showed her some sweet dance

1566
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:50,920
moves yeah and then she was like that's

1567
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:52,900
exactly what happened but that's really

1568
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:56,080
it was just kind of like she was in our

1569
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:58,210
group of friends and she was like super

1570
01:00:56,080 --> 01:01:00,400

we became super good super good friends

1575
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:11,410

we initially met apparently Orion has a

1624
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:52,180
different story but I thought we met

1625
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:53,740

1626
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:56,140

01:02:53,740 --> 01:03:01,150
in she's comes back into town spoilers

1628
01:02:56,140 --> 01:03:02,230
oh but we met this is my story on the

1629
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:04,360
set

1630
01:03:02,230 --> 01:03:05,680
I seen a video when we were like I was

1631
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:08,350
made Wong foo casting agents of secret

1632
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:09,820
stuff yeah 2010 and I was weighing their

1633
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:12,640
videos I mean like okay who would be a

1634
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:14,680
good tailor which is the name of the

1635
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:16,330
girl in the in the short so we're going

1636
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:17,620
to all these different people that want

1637
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:18,880
food kind of like auditioned or whatever

1638
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:21,310
but apparently according to art and I

1639
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:25,030
was there at the auditions and like or

1640
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:26,770
the casting and I do not recall that at

1641
01:03:25,030 --> 01:03:28,540
all I don't remember seeing people

1642
01:03:26,770 --> 01:03:30,040
reading I was never a casting person I

1643
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:31,570
never you know I wouldn't know how to do

1644
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:34,750
that so I'm pretty sure wasn't there but

1645
01:03:31,570 --> 01:03:37,030
she says I was but supposedly we met

1646
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:39,160
there and she auditioned for this thing

1647
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:40,510
and I looked through the tapes these

1648
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:43,840
different tapes and I remember being

1649
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:47,140
like oh she's good I want her and that's

1650
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:49,360
how we met initially on that set and we

1651
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:52,900
weren't dating obviously we're just

1652
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:55,150
working and it was after I guess after

1653
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:57,070
we finished filming we kind of stayed in

1654
01:03:55,150 --> 01:03:59,950
touch and we kind of started hanging out

1655
01:03:57,070 --> 01:04:01,540
more we weren't really dating um but

1656
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:02,890
basically it didn't work out we were

1657
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:03,880
like we like I think we've both liked

1658
01:04:02,890 --> 01:04:06,030
each other but it just didn't work out

1659
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:10,210
at the time I think I was like not even

1660
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:11,740
19 or 20 20 maybe and she's like 24 or

1661
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:12,100
something like that and she's older than

1662
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:13,329
her

1663
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:15,849
we're 23

1664
01:04:13,329 --> 01:04:17,440
on line she was like older than me and I

1665
01:04:15,849 --> 01:04:20,559
can see from her perspective being the

1666
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:21,849
girl and you're not even now remember

1667
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:24,609
like we'd going I couldn't even drink

1668
01:04:21,849 --> 01:04:26,650
hey tell of a snake story dude oh yeah

1669
01:04:24,609 --> 01:04:28,299
and then the steak story does a snake

1670
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:31,209
story well I want to bring that up when

1671
01:04:28,299 --> 01:04:36,309
she when she uh when she comes on so she

1672
01:04:31,209 --> 01:04:37,749
can defend herself my story is way

1673
01:04:36,309 --> 01:04:39,759
different than yeah that's what I mean

1674
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:42,789
so I think it's well that was how we met

1675
01:04:39,759 --> 01:04:45,430
yeah how we started dating and then we

1676
01:04:42,789 --> 01:04:50,859
got back in touch later down the road

1677
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:53,589
before a collab that we did every room

1678
01:04:50,859 --> 01:04:55,420
the romantic knows before that before we

1679
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:58,239
we got back in touch through Facebook

1680
01:04:55,420 --> 01:05:03,789
before that whatever what was that video

1681
01:04:58,239 --> 01:05:05,289

1688
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,449

01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:30,740
we wanted to do another segment in the

1714
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,660
future I just don't know how to do it I

1715
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:34,640
want to do like a radio show you know

1716
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:37,099
how they do like prank calls yeah but

1717
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:38,960
like really like not just like your

1718
01:06:37,099 --> 01:06:41,990
refrigerator whatever like really

1719
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,349
detailed ones like let's I really want

1720
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:45,200
to do that

1721
01:06:42,349 --> 01:06:46,310
um there's there's there's been like not

1722
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,480
I'm not that I want to get into pranks

1723
01:06:46,310 --> 01:06:49,490
but there's been this radio show I've

1724
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:52,069
been listening to it here and they do

1725
01:06:49,490 --> 01:06:53,630
like these prank calls and they're super

1726
01:06:52,069 --> 01:06:55,339
basically a friend will recommend hate

1727
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:56,869
prank call my friend hmm and they come

1728
01:06:55,339 --> 01:06:58,819
up with these scenarios and they get all

1729
01:06:56,869 --> 01:07:00,500
this information so they really make it

1730
01:06:58,819 --> 01:07:02,930
feel real I want to do something like

1731
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:04,550
that I think we could do it live I think

1732
01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:06,619
it'd be funnier though if we did it to

1733
01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:08,300
other youtubers maybe cuz they know of

1734
01:07:06,619 --> 01:07:10,160
you people like you know yeah yeah

1735
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:11,450
almost like a Punk'd but if we would

1736
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:13,160
have to get permission from the friend

1737
01:07:11,450 --> 01:07:14,780
because that's how we would get the

1738
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:16,579
information yeah it's hard to prank

1739
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:18,530
youtubers cuz they already get pranked

1740
01:07:16,579 --> 01:07:20,630
like a lie you do is I know that even me

1741
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:23,359
like I don't answer any calls unless I

1742
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:24,260
know who it is so I don't know just

1743
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:25,760
something that is just try think of

1744
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:26,810
something else we could do yeah I don't

1745
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:28,010
know let us know in the comments what

1746
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:31,520
else we should do here I just got the

1747
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:35,000
idea from that radio show also since we

1748
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:37,220

1749
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,560
