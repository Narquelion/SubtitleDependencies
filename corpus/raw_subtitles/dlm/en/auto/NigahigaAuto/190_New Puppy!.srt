00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,810
hey guys as many of you know I have a

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,549
dog named Marley and you may have seen

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,429
him in a few videos here and there but

4
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:09,990
recently I just got another puppy he's a

5
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:11,519
Corgi and I haven't thought of a name

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,860
for him yet so I've just been calling

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,480
him Marley the Corgi and he has such a

8
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,100
cute and lovable puppy but for some

9
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,869
reason ever since we got in my other dog

10
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,460
Marley has been acting up and misbehaved

11
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:22,080
for example I came home and I saw Marley

12
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,029
tearing up all of our trash in my living

13
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,590
room and he knows better he knows not to

14
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:26,880
do that or like now Marley is the only

15
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,470
one that sleeps in my bedroom because

16
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,660
he's potty-trained but ever since we got

17
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,189
the new dog I'll wake up and find a poop

18
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,719
on my floor and I don't even know how he

19
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,430
did it but he somehow managed to get

20
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,559
onto a table that's two feet taller than

21
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:45,660
him and knocked over a vase and cracked

22
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:46,710
it on our floor bad boy Marley so I

23
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,289
don't know he's just been acting like

24
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,700
crazy like crazy lately and and I'm even

25
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:52,110
like now look you just scratch he's

26
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,699
scratching on the door and I'm trying to

27
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,020
film I'm trying to film Harley I think

28
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:56,550
he's probably just jealous or the other

29
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,390
dog but I don't understand why because I

30
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,250
show him just as much attention

31
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,620
sometimes I just wonder like what is

32
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,870
going through his head no no no no I'm

33
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:09,330
not a kid I didn't even do anything this

34
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:11,130
time ah hey hey hey you I know you're

35
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,869
just a puppy and and maybe we got off on

36
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,030
the wrong paw but do you think you could

37
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:18,270
help me out of here got your dirty

38
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,650
little snout you filthy mutt um you

39
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,659
might have been the only dog before but

40
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,130
this is my house now well actually we're

41
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,330
both kind of just sharing why do you

42
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,040
think you're even locked up like you're

43
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,689
at the pound right now what do you mean

44
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,400
you actually believe that there would be

45
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:31,170
a treat lying in the middle of trash in

46
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,549
the living room floor for no reason at

47
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,140
all or don't you find it a little

48
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:35,909
strange that you've never sleep poop

49
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,290
before yet every morning you wake up and

50
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:38,820
there's magically another piece of poo

51
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,290
there and are you that stupid to believe

52
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,040
that a vase would magically fall off a

53
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:46,110
table when to deadly right next to you

54
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,110
you you were trying to frame me

55
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:52,350
no wali boy I was trying to kill you

56
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:55,820

57
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,820
Marley the Corgi let's go film a video

58
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,610
have to warn Ryan how do I get up well

59
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,430
maybe if I start digging I can get out

60
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:05,100
of here but no that's right I could just

61
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,390
push it over so as always saying I I

62
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,040
just don't I don't know what to do with

63
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,450
that dog like I'm really hoping that

64
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,710
it's just a phase that he's going

65
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,140
through right now I can't just like

66
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:14,400
return a dog because my other dog

67
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,530
doesn't like here it's like two brothers

68
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:21,990
and the older one is just at the younger

69
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:27,510
one as it's really damn it boy but now

70
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:31,590
