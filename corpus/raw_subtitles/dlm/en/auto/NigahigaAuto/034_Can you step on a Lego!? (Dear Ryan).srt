00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,970

3
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,069
right into it

4
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:14,670
dear Ryan can you say em without

5
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:18,180
touching your lips and mm and and tell

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:21,480
me and and and that's cheating can I use

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:25,230
my teeth mmm technically my lips aren't

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:28,410
touch okay that's cheating and mmm this

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,210
is so frustrating okay you can you it's

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,560
it's impossible it's not possible thanks

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,090
for making me a little unity well I say

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,800
a lot of you at home just did that so

13
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,260
don't even judge me how stupid I look

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,280
because you probably look just as stupid

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,050
but more handsome

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,640
do you Ryan can you do emoji impressions

17
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,079
I actually have never tried that before

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,410
so I'm not sure I mean I'll do as many

19
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,410
as I can

20
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,539
yeah this last one is kind of racist

21
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,129
anyway that's pretty much all the emoji

22
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,550
impressions I can do I try to do as many

23
00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:03,780
as I could with the oh I get it because

24
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,920
I'm Asian haha good one man and now

25
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,049
you're calling me a girl I'm not even

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,350
wearing a red dress what is this a it's

27
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,520
not your best insult like steer you know

28
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,010
what I'm not gonna take this kind of

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,869
insults from emoji I have no reason to

30
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,520
get mad I'm not even making a fist now

31
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:21,960
what is that supposed to read what the

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,900
hell just stop just stop it this is my

33
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,909
video and this is my idea there's no way

34
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,860
that somebody like you

35
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:31,630
dear Ryan can you do the stitch voice

36
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,979
again it's actually really simple all

37
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:35,049
you have to do is make the awesome like

38
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:36,340
you're at the dentist like ah and then

39
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:41,200
while you're doing that move your tongue

40
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:43,119
back yes oh it's like you're gargling

41
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,470
like you're closing off your throat so

42
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,610
you don't swallow your mouthwash so make

43
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,750
a dentist sound I don't know why I'm

44
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,920
doing all these dental hygienic

45
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,000
references so you're gonna make the

46
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,170
sound like you're at the dentist by

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,460
closing off your throats that you don't

48
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,899
swallow the mouthwash and he's pouring

49
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,189
in your mouth not that they do that once

50
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:56,380

51
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:59,829

52
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:01,899
bottle bottle of the fun awful tonight

53
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:04,149
dear Ryan can you be a CS gamer you mean

54
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:06,549
CS like counter-strike no I don't have

55
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:08,440
time to be playing video games because

56
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:10,179
video games are a waste of time

57
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,560
and for anyone that plays you make

58
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:14,049
carnage that cartridge is such an old

59
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,910
game that I don't figure what the hell

60
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:17,830
do you Ryan what does a transformer

61
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,250
sport sound like that's a good question

62
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,560
actually

63
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,510
what do your fart sound like sounds like

64
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,579
a fork that's auto-tune fart with

65
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:31,599
auto-tune what does that sound like wait

66
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:33,400
a second do that again is exactly what

67
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,359
dubstep sounds like a forceout a really

68
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,359
long one this time all right

69
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:48,150
oh hey what happened what was that sorry

70
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,490
that sounds like trap music yeah I know

71
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,840
I sharted deer right can you step on a

72
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,550
leg oh I don't know why people make such

73
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,200
a big deal about stepping on Legos it's

74
00:02:53,550 --> 00:03:03,210
not hard to do people just over

75
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:04,920
exaggerate watch it ya know it doesn't

76
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,720
hurt that much I mean people really do

77
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,340
over exaggerate I mean it kinda hurts

78
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:26,870
but that money goes really doesn't hurt

79
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:41,640
anyone they stepped on me son thank you

80
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:43,010
like humans promise you father my

81
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,410
revenge

82
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:49,080
Legos just because it doesn't hurt you

83
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,250
don't mean it don't hurt nobody else doe

84
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,650
do you're right you can mathematically

85
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,650
prove that 9 plus 10 equals 21

86
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,889
[Music]

87
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:05,160
how does 9 plus 10 equal 21 well the

88
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,000
obvious answer is 19 but I don't know

89
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,400
where to go from there

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,319
wait a second remember just now when you

91
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,930
said the obvious answer was 19 and then

92
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,450
I said wait a second yeah that just

93
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:18,239
happened 19 wait a second

94
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,500
19 seconds 1 remember 19 seconds into

95
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,820
this video I was doing the dear Ryan

96
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,650
where I had to say the letter M without

97
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,300
touching lips yeah so well it's

98
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,800
impossible to say the letter M with one

99
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,580
lip you need tulips

100
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:32,460
speaking of tulips tulips are a flower

101
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:35,760
flowers have petals and petals like gas

102
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:38,880
pedals or in automobiles and automobiles

103
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,139
what transformers turn into transformers

104
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,000
what are you getting in remember the

105
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:43,950
Transformers dear Ryan we just did yeah

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,720
when you press down on the gas pedal it

107
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,310
releases gas from its exhaust that's

108
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,960
basically a Transformers bar and if you

109
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,030
remember a Transformers part is

110
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,160
equivalent to what dubstep but if a

111
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,810
transformer pushes too hard and forces

112
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,780
out a fart he won't just fart dubstep

113
00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:00,270
he'll shark shut out what Ryan trap

114
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:04,370
music which means this whole equation

115
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:04,370
it's just one big trap

116
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,279
[Applause]

117
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:19,630
well well well looks like you figured it

118
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:24,250
out who are you oh you don't remember

119
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:26,350
maybe this will help huh is this a

120
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,509
picture of you laying down that is my

121
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,639

one of us hurts Oh No let's see how you

126
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:43,470

[Music]
