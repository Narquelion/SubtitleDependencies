1
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:18,410

8
00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:30,050
Ryan but I think he's right this time

9
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,730
you both are just gonna give up then no

10
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,290

Rolled people last year to remember

14
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,489
isn't the number one rule surprise to

15
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,470
not repeat the same rules since when are

16
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:44,150
there rules and like I already said it's

17
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,560
April Fool's it's not gonna work Oh what

18
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,180
do you guys really think I haven't

19
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,430
thought of that I have a lead on how to

20
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,230
find the next Rick rule full thought-out

21
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,510
plan but I'm still gonna need your guys

22
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,950
commitments what I'm just trying to help

23
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,390
I feel like I don't contribute to any of

24
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,950
these thinking you're right back on the

25
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,540
same page Sean let's get this started of

26
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:01,160
course he's gonna side with you again

27
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,480
you guys know that in Rick Astley's song

28
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,129
never gonna give you up he says the word

29
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,689
never quite frequently wouldn't it be

30
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,100
crazy if I told you that there's a song

31
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:08,390
that says the word never even more than

32
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,130
that even though the song is about never

33
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,960
saying never get this in Rick Astley

34
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:14,180
song he says the word 41 times exactly

35
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,070
including the title in Justin Bieber's

36
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,540
song he says the word 69 times including

37
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,800
the title from a guy who's saying never

38
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,970
to say never isn't it a little weird

39
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,650
that he's saying the word never

40
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,850
twenty-eight more times than Rick anyone

41
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,200
starting to see the obvious sign here

42
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,610
other than the two of them saying the

43
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,200
word never a lot no there's no

44
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:30,680
connection guys it's so obvious

45
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,860
seriously you two Sean I still don't get

46
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,510
it

47
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,100
justin is 20 years old why don't take a

48
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,590
guess how old rick astley is tell us

49
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,580
already you are no fun he's 48 how much

50
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,110
do you think the difference between the

51
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,540
two ages are I'm just gonna take a wild

52
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:42,920
guess and say 28 the exact difference of

53
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,030
the number of times they say never in

54
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,590
each of their songs seal in the

55
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:48,020
connection yet gotta admit that's a good

56
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,640
one making one connection or coincidence

57
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,409
I should say doesn't mean anything you

58
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,000
sure about that understand this

59
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:54,380
Never Say Never was not just Justin's

60
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,820
biggest song but his biggest movie

61
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,470
couldn't be his only movie if he keeps

62
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,420
getting arrested I'm on break he's a kid

63
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:01,760
who said it yourself he's 20 years old

64
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,440
he's all grown up never mind I was just

65
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,940
trying to contribute again gonna shut up

66
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,409

67
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,850
you were saying down to the roots of

68
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:09,140
