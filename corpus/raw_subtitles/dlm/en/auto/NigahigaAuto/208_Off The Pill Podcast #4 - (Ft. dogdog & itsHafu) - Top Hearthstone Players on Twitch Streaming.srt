1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,959

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:17,190
cameras on the monitor so just you see

00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:22,130

one one month two people were at it and

6
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:29,880
it was like one person would donate a

7
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,529
thousand and then it was two thousand

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,270
from the other guy and then three does

9
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:37,399

every single part yes

13
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:50,250

14
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,860

17
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:00,930
that was a good sound effect we're gonna

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,870
put something in like a little clap or

19
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:06,979
something I just did put in the sounds

20
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:10,020

00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:11,820
I mean you guys can talk about who you

22
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,680
guys are like you guys are from the

23
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,880
streamer world that's how I want to

24
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:21,659
describe it from my understanding

25
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:25,640
David is a professional I can always say

26
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:28,680
it wrong but I say her heart the stone

27
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,689
not hearthstone not hearthstone players

28
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,600
hard to play but and Paco said you're

29
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:39,150
the number one player in the in North

30
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:41,670
America yeah or is the world on my

31
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,280
ladder ranking Yeah right now it's crazy

32
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:47,610
and then ha fou from my understanding as

33
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,470
well is the og streamer streaming before

34
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,329
you know all the little kids hopped on

35
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,340
Whaley was it twitch was it always

36
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:56,460
twitch that you were on yeah twitch for

37
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,890
six and a half years now Wow how long

38
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,590
has twitch been have you been never the

39
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,799
song I started like eight years ago I

40
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,570
was looking at the top trends I'm 16 oh

41
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:09,509
wow for the people who still stream now

42
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,280
I'm sure they're long yeah yeah yeah for

43
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:12,880
people who are still streaming now I'm

44
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:21,430
like 16th oldest

45
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:24,160
and dig pride in that is that good we're

46
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:27,820
just oh yeah we've been doing it for so

47
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,530
long do you know anyone I don't think

48
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,510
probably not but do you know any other

49
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,480
streamers that are just completely

50
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:35,590
different you not just give their names

51
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,120
how do they do it though for so long

52
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:39,220
because you have to stream for hours I

53
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,740
think some people have a persona and I

54
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:45,100
think they stream less so a nice dream

55
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:49,300
and if I do like a 15 hour stream by

56
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:50,920
hour 10 I'm not talking yeah zombie mode

57
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,630
that's my leg just like people don't

58
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,860
people love it right they're still like

59
00:02:52,630 --> 00:03:00,190
I mean they're probably there with you

60
00:02:53,860 --> 00:03:01,660
just chilling some people you know if

61
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,550
they have like a persona that they have

62
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,630
to they have to fulfill and I mean

63
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,760
that's even more entertaining to watch

64
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:08,410
but that's not all twitch is right like

65
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,940
there's a lot of different things you

66
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,030
can do right right right right that's

67
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:16,090
well said do you guys think that um

68
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:18,190
ninja is authentic or is he I mean have

69
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,480
you met him yeah we getting into it I

70
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,710
mean I'm just that's the first person

71
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,210
that came to mind cuz he's like the

72
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:27,430
biggest person biggest one on Twitter

73
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:31,240
yeah I think I worked an event with him

74
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,920
a few years ago but yeah I think he's

75
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,810
more or less the same but obviously you

76
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,190
give it a little bit more and I watched

77
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,010
too much of his four-night stuff because

78
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:41,380
I don't play for tonight right um I

79
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:45,100
think I think he's more or less genuine

80
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:46,630
and or like very true to his his normal

81
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,400
self I don't think he I mean you can

82
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,230
also have to like filter yourself a lot

83
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,900
but like not a lot but like a little bit

84
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,460
right like you can't be being like super

85
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,780
vulgar if you feel really angry you

86
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,430
don't want to like portray that right

87
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,510
right so you kind of have to like filter

88
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,940
yourself a little bit and try to get

89
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,920
yourself in like a better mood and yeah

90
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,780
it's just don't think that would be fun

91
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:09,810
to like if someone I really liked though

92
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:12,940
got super mad when they lost it anymore

93
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:16,000
that one streamer what's his name well

94
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:18,160
yeah Tyler one rage is like a shroud who

95
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,250
like punched his camera no no those are

96
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,110
out that was something

97
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:25,700
Samet he punched his uh his monitor and

98
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:35,240
the camera was on the monitor so just

99
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:38,270
you see him he's another one like the

100
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,770
really old streamers oh yeah I think

101
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,330
that's been on the platform for a long

102
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,940
time and he's kind of always been

103
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:45,650
themselves that's how he is Canada

104
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,450
summit rage see that was like my biggest

105
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,670
fear even for doing stuff like this I

106
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:51,650
always felt like you know even vlogs I

107
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:53,180
have to be so like hey guys like right

108
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,620
energy that's how YouTube was and it

109
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,690
just always been my style and it's

110
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,650
exhausting like nothing just talking

111
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:01,250
like this you could do this for a long

112
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:03,710
time I don't feel like if I had to put

113
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,970
up that that kind of energy for I

114
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:07,100
couldn't stream for like three hours

115
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:10,160
even yeah I mean that definitely makes

116
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:13,610
sense you're acting yeah that's it is it

117
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,230
is or super over exaggerated yeah if you

118
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:17,419
like strained out if you do that yeah

119
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,710
yeah but I don't know most at least me

120
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:19,790
and maymay are a lot of streamers

121
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:22,460
they're just kind of like hang out and

122
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:23,780
play games I'm curious are you guys have

123
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,960
you ever did myers-briggs the

124
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:29,540
myers-briggs test we took it for each

125
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,040
other I'm Steven s are you funny are you

126
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:35,390
guys what what all right do you remember

127
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:38,030
uh I know I'm like super extroverted

128
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:40,040
yeah you can see that remember I'm the

129
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:41,960
thing for the entrepreneur I'm like

130
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,540
close to that or the Entertainer like

131
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,750
one of those two and then David was I

132
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,860
don't know I think we're like INF I

133
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:51,440
thinking that you are an i that's why

134
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,840
I'm curious because that's usually

135
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,669
basically introverts get tired from

136
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,590
having to be around people I guess but

137
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:59,150
the because you're not you are with

138
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,160
people though I am with people that I'm

139
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,600
not with yeah right like I feel like I'm

140
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,669
not trying to like entertain I'm just

141
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,169
kind of like being there right like it's

142
00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:08,479
like watching TV you can't really get

143
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:10,700
drained by watching TV so there's hope

144
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,500
see it is possible to be introverted and

145
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,030
stream streamer I thought it was like

146
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,100
there's no way introverts would last

147
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:18,500
it's too exhausting for them yeah I mean

148
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,850
it's a form of interaction yeah you're

149
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,409
interacting with people to a certain

150
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:25,879
extent so mmm-hmm

151
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:27,409
but well the the reason why I guess it

152
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:29,899
what's kind of ingrained in me because I

153
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:30,559
learned really a lot when I was a lot

154
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:32,300
younger

155
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:33,860
I guess high school time doing doing

156
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,769
videos and blogs and stuff like that if

157
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:38,839
I wasn't that character like if I wasn't

158
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:40,729
on and like happy everywhere I go in

159
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:43,789
blogs people are like why are you such a

160
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:48,559
dick why are you so mad right now I know

161
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:55,099
this is this is my face all the worst is

162
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:57,800
when it's like are you sick but yeah if

163
00:06:55,099 --> 00:07:00,349
you don't make a bun yeah oh man what's

164
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:05,839
wrong with your face today they said to

165
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:07,699
even in person people wouldn't say it to

166
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:08,449
you in person though no I haven't had

167
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:10,429
that in person

168
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:11,929
oh maybe sometimes at school if you have

169
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:15,139
less makeup on we're like are you okay

170
00:07:11,929 --> 00:07:17,809
today you feeling all right yeah well I

171
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:19,399
mean that's just like that just I mean

172
00:07:17,809 --> 00:07:21,800
that's gonna happen to girls everything

173
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:23,719
online I'm sure you have some it's

174
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,519
probably such a different experience for

175
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:27,949
girls I would assume it's gotten a lot

176
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:31,279
better especially as the gap between

177
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:34,099
genders in gaming has diminished so yeah

178
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:37,399
yeah still fine so what are you

179
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:41,419
currently are you still playing are you

180
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:48,079
guys playing the same game stone and the

181
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:51,229
new expansion just dropped the content

182
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:53,209
still feels good going again yeah right

183
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:54,800
cuz you for a while when it was it was

184
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:56,119
kind of getting like I mean even you

185
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,589
guys were having a hard time saying like

186
00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:59,949
oh yeah I want to play something else

187
00:07:57,589 --> 00:08:03,379
sometimes but like I guess if they

188
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:05,089
created new cards or what they did in

189
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:07,699
the expansion it kind of changes

190
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:09,919
everything but doesn't it always end up

191
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:13,610
being missing yeah like there's like one

192
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,929
like really good deck is that Colin or

193
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,399
certain things it always ends up being

194
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:17,899
the same thing right it takes time to

195
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:19,219
like figure that out and that's that's

196
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:20,749
when it's really fun when people are

197
00:08:19,219 --> 00:08:22,519
being creative and like you know making

198
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:24,619
decks and things but you're the guy yeah

199
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:26,749
I look at the copy they copy you yeah

200
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:29,659
actually God is so crazy yeah that's

201
00:08:26,749 --> 00:08:31,279
crazy and whenever I play those kind of

202
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:33,439
games or any kind of game I'm all on

203
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,060
that guy who's gonna go with the

204
00:08:33,439 --> 00:08:36,200
weirdest route

205
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,450
because I want to be different but it

206
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,090
never works like the smartest ways just

207
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:43,490
to look it up and then copy what they do

208
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:45,500
but still be more secure you can't do

209
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,690
that you're having fun you're that guy

210
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,250
who actually knows what he's doing and

211
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,230
gets to have fun green the new thing is

212
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,120
yeah I'm the same way I liked writing

213
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:55,730
something like really weird like find a

214
00:08:53,120 --> 00:09:04,250
mechanic in it like can I make this work

215
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:05,830
and then so satisfied but all the pieces

216
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:10,040
of puzzle together and it's like yes

217
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:11,120
yeah so did you start um I don't know if

218
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,410
you already said this but when did you

219
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,140
start streaming ah

220
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:17,000
I started streaming four years ago I

221
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,910
think about four years ago yeah yeah

222
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,220
long time it was out of college I was

223
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:24,130
just kind of bored I was like myzel

224
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:27,980
stream what are you going to college for

225
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:30,830
biology degree that's pretty bad oh yeah

226
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,870
okay this sounds like me kind of but you

227
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:34,790
finished I did finish but I finished

228
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:36,950
like a year late I was supposed to

229
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,630
graduate like I don't know a semester

230
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:41,270
earlier but has it helped you in

231
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:42,620
streaming no but I don't going to

232
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,700
college yeah I mean it taught me how to

233
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,290
interact with people a little brighter

234
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,120
and take care of myself

235
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,890
not that I do that great of a job of it

236
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:53,510
but uh healthy

237
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:55,040
I mean I'm alive you know considering I

238
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,600
mean a lot like you said a lot of the

239
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,920
time you guys I don't know if we said

240
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,560
this when the cameras are rolling or not

241
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:05,420
but a lot of times you guys sit very a

242
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:07,339
long time er sitters they need to try

243
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,690
and think of something that the somebody

244
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:10,310
was talking about like when you sit for

245
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,720
a long time there's something really

246
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,910
dangerous about that I don't know if you

247
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,250
guys read that or not I was my entire

248
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:25,010
life style is terrible you guys look

249
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:29,209
fine like we don't leave our place to go

250
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:31,910
to work yeah that's like I feel like if

251
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:34,100
I had one of those pedometers mmm so

252
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:35,870

00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,690
starts it would say like less than a

254
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:40,290
thousand

255
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:43,170

met through like you man and there's

286
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:04,709
always ask people who are like in every

stream to help them like those are the

288
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:08,009
people you want because they're there

289
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,930
anyway right right right yeah so that

290
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:11,279
really is your lifestyle then I thought

291
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,389
you guys were exaggerating the last time

292
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,730
we know about that

293
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:19,019
I think people always think that we

294
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:21,809
exaggerate but no we are we're no life

295
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:24,509
yeah you enjoy it like staying home

296
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:26,490
right I mean I love playing I don't know

297
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:28,769
how I've gotten away with this lifestyle

298
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:29,639
for this long cuz ever since I was 17

299
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:33,629
and I was like well I can't do this

300
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:35,160
forever but I somehow I used to be a

301
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:36,029
professional World of Warcraft player

302
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,670
mm-hmm

303
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:41,759
Ted I'm 27 oh my gosh but when I

304
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:44,100
seventeen it's just so weird thinking

305
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:48,420
about that girl

306
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,350
yeah I feel so young but I'm old now

307
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,180
yeah

308
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:53,520
I feel young because I've had the same

309
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:56,150
lifestyle ever since I was young and

310
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,150
nothing's changed

311
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,840
it works I mean yeah you know in the

312
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:05,490
same way I mean I felt very similar yeah

313
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,050
I thought you know at the time it was

314
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:09,570
like youtubers careers lasted maybe

315
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:11,550
three years once they like kind of and

316
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:13,230
then I've had many down years and then

317
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,970
many up years is just like oh that's

318
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,470
very fortunate but it's not gonna last

319
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:18,210
cuz there's always gonna be someone else

320
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:20,040
the weird thing is that there were so

321
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:22,260
many more people coming to watch YouTube

322
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,810
that and I think it's the same with

323
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,010
twitch that even if there are other

324
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,720
people getting bigger there's just so

325
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:30,120
much people to you know there's just

326
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,800
some part one person the actual platform

327
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,750
is growing right right so there's more

328
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,280
viewers for you so it's not like anyone

329
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,930
else is taking anything away from you

330
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,610
right exactly and I don't think at the

331
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:42,150
time people thought of it like if

332
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:43,200
someone else is big you're done but it

333
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,310
kind of was because it was like people

334
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,780
would shift over but now it's like

335
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:47,880
there's so many people to go around like

336
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:51,720
everybody has their own personal tastes

337
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:54,060
I'm sure and he can consume YouTube like

338
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,820
you can consume multiple people at SIA

339
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:59,130
how to say it that like one viewer can

340
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:01,050
watch a bunch of youtubers right it's

341
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,340
like yeah you know a five minute or a 10

342
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:04,290
minute segment or even if it's like an

343
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,850
hour of content week it's still another

344
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:07,530
just like channel channel hop right

345
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,480
right I would say in streaming it's a

346
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:11,280
little different yeah you can die in

347
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,020
streaming because when you die in

348
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,840
popularity it's like you're competing

349
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:17,100
like one viewer can open a few streams

350
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,860
but they're really gonna be active in

351
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,810
one maybe uh-huh and so you if you lose

352
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:26,190
a viewer then you're you actually lose

353
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:27,810
oh they start watching someone else and

354
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:30,720
then yeah that person kind of takes over

355
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:32,700
so that's the obligation yeah you kind

356
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,780
of need to be on like one consistently

357
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:38,160
that sounds exhausting in my opinion I

358
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,410
don't know how it is in YouTube because

359
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,870
I do know that like peoples it's like

360
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:45,570
your total view count right is what

361
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:47,690
matters that well it's a lot of it is

362
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:50,310
watch time now oh okay that helps you uh

363
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:52,080
you know get suggested pose and like it

364
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:54,000
helps you basically stay more relevant

365
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,560
um so that's why people have been doing

366
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,020
longer videos and you can also get

367
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,880
better ads like significantly better ads

368
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:02,390
so you like double your revenue triples

369
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,860
sometimes so yeah it's it's heavily

370
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:09,320
based on that everyone should keep

371
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:10,460
watching yeah but I mean like that's I

372
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,580
mean that's one of the reasons why

373
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:16,490
podcast it's taken off you know and I

374
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,090
think people use YouTube in a different

375
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,110
way

376
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:20,840
and I think just in general

377
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:24,110
entertainment even like twitch like I

378
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:26,150
feel like five even like five ten years

379
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,560
ago it was it was nothing like nobody

380
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,930
wanted to just listen to other people

381
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,970
but I feel like they use even for me

382
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:34,130
like I use YouTube and listen to podcast

383
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,110
just what I'm doing other things just to

384
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,670
have somebody like not somebody there

385
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,200
but like just to have something almost

386
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,090
like background noise kind of right

387
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,500
right like I'm not there watching yeah

388
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:45,050
you're not actively watching you're just

389
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,310
kind of like yeah look it's a similar

390
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:48,890
thing that's kind of like the whole

391
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:51,530
trend that's happening from streaming I

392
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:54,020
mean I feels like that's like the

393
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:55,940
popular thing right now yeah I mean I

394
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,710
usually always have a stream on when I'm

395
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,420
on my computer and I just have it in the

396
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:01,190
background yeah right and it's like I'm

397
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:03,710
never like just sitting there staring at

398
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:05,030
those because you're not like actively

399
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:07,070
watching but it's like I don't know it's

400
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,690
a very passive thing for me also yeah

401
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,710
see I'll have yeah you'll have someone

402
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,030
in the background you're playing games

403
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:15,040
and like oh that's interesting or

404
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:15,040
something exciting happens when yeah

405
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:19,580
that's that's crazy so that is you're

406
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:21,520
okay so that's your lifestyle you pretty

407
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:24,080
much stream everyday you wake up

408
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,850
bathroom food and I know you guys have

409
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,050
you you get food delivered so you really

410
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,940
have to leave your house yeah that's

411
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:30,710
amazing

412
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:32,480
what was even crazier to me is that you

413
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:34,760
guys leave the house so little and when

414
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:40,190
you do you BRR or take a car or whatever

415
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:41,390
right once I was um I don't know if I

416
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:44,540
should tell this story know you can tell

417
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:47,900
me to stop once I was taking the two of

418
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:54,440
them home and I was like oh so wait do I

419
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:56,150
turn here for a little bit but it's so

420
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,900
crazy to me but it makes sense cuz you

421
00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:01,940
guys don't need to leave for your job or

422
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:03,650
yeah yeah I mean I don't know the way to

423
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:06,400
the airport and I go to the airport a

424
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:08,420
lot that's true I guess if you yeah

425
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,070
right you don't really need to know

426
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,190
you're probably doing all this like on

427
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:14,550
your phone like you need

428
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:17,730
attention it feels really weird oh man I

429
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:19,650
wanna like another show on Twitch called

430
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:21,870
analysis northernlion Super Show and

431
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:24,150
they were like kind of interrogating me

432
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:32,160
because people finally realized that I

433
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:40,890
am that you boiled water and I was like

434
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:42,990
no never done it and it's because I mean

435
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:48,510
when I was younger we had one of those

436
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:50,040
like water boiler thing yeah and I make

437
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:55,440
my instant noodles that way like right

438
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:57,360
how I would and but yeah I mean I order

439
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,650
all my food and then I also drink

440
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,990
Soylent which is like a meal replacement

441
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:03,630
drink uh-huh and so that gets me through

442
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:06,750
like really long streams hmm did you get

443
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:13,200
sponsored yeah we have zero sponsors so

444
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:19,860
Soylent has to go Soylent yeah well

445
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:21,950
we'll see I mean I drink it like anytime

446
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:24,480
I'm in the long hours it's actually

447
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:27,090
sponsored does it actually make you feel

448
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,070
like you're uh like full it's 400

449
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:31,170
calories so it'll make you feel like you

450
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:33,810
consumed 400 calories and more

451
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:35,730
importantly oh man my okay this is bad

452
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:37,800
to say but my body doesn't like feel

453
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,880
hunger anymore I just get headaches and

454
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:44,640
that's how I know I'm hungry

455
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:45,870
it's very strict bad because I just tune

456
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,790
out my hunger because I don't want to

457
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,950
stop streaming especially when I first

458
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:52,590
started because I was always afraid like

459
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:54,450
if I stop streaming I'm gonna lose my

460
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,220
momentum you know I have to just keep

461
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:59,430
working because I love this job and

462
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:05,640
that's some crazy aggression and now I

463
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:06,870
know I'm like over time I think for

464
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,340
everybody especially when you're on your

465
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,960
your highs you know you want to make

466
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:12,180
sure like I got to keep this going yeah

467
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,090
you ride it right right yeah I think

468
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:17,180
yeah as long as people um I mean I think

469
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:21,150
for in everything you just have to know

470
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:22,750
not I truly believe it's it's a balance

471
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:24,280
to everything and not finding

472
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:34,630
getting too high when you're high too

473
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:36,520
low in your low you know one extreme or

474
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:39,730
the other in everything

475
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,850
how about for you David uh I'm a little

476
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:43,929
bit more well-rounded but not as much

477
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:47,169
especially this past year I've just been

478
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:48,760
working a little bit but I mean that's

479
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:52,120
fine I mean we just like hanging out all

480
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:55,000
the time and yeah I don't do much I eat

481
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:58,539
and I sleep and I scream what would you

482
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,870
do if I've got every mess it up every

483
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:01,270
time

484
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:03,070
hearthstone mm-hmm doesn't become as

485
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,900
like let's say another game comes out

486
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:07,360
and I heard some becomes less relevant

487
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:09,850
yeah you still try and stick with it

488
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,320
which what would make you take the leap

489
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:15,880
I'd probably just play whatever I want

490
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:18,309
to play you would I think I played I

491
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,780
want to play I mean I do I do for the

492
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:21,400
most part like I'll put in hearthstone

493
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,570
or as long as I want to play it and then

494
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,770
I'll play something else you want to

495
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:25,990
play DotA but you don't want to stream

496
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:28,360
it it's cause it's like my relaxing time

497
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:30,669
right like it's it's something that I do

498
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:33,760
to like I don't know I get embarrassed

499
00:20:30,669 --> 00:20:35,289
but like he's very good though yeah I'm

500
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,730
like pretty good but like it's it's more

501
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:38,710
for like myself right like there's

502
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:40,659
things that you do for yourself and like

503
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:43,150
and you don't really want people to see

504
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:44,650
makes sense yeah but I'll stream

505
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:46,950
everything else yeah I don't really care

506
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:49,720
from bad you care about your views uh

507
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:51,820
yes that's what I'm saying yeah you

508
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,760
wouldn't really do just like I feel like

509
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:59,200
your account matters because it's ours

510
00:20:54,760 --> 00:21:00,460
it's like otherwise it's not that you

511
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,080
care about like the money or anything

512
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,080
like that but it's like to be able to

513
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:10,030
care about it a little bit yeah and I

514
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:11,500
always ask people I like but you should

515
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:13,090
just stream what you want to stream and

516
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,950
I'm like okay would you go to work if

517
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:17,380
you got paid half the amount they're

518
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,549
like no I'm like okay well yeah yeah I

519
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,590
mean and that's the thing too is like

520
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:23,200
people I mean you can say even for

521
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:25,059
myself you can say you know it's not

522
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,610
about the money but you still need money

523
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:29,860
- yeah I think I think people are

524
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:31,450
starting to I mean at least in the

525
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,309
YouTube world they kind of get that now

526
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:35,429
they know it's heavily involved it's

527
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:37,559
about it's a balance like you said yeah

528
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:38,940
you're balancing between probably what

529
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:40,950
your viewers want to see and you want to

530
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,929
play it have fun exactly I mean you you

531
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:51,839
play games with less viewership right

532
00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:55,259
yeah yeah my numbers we're like one

533
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:57,659
third literally one third so I usually

534
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:59,249
like three four thousand viewers

535
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:00,570
okay so what were you playing like

536
00:21:59,249 --> 00:22:02,549
thousand do you think it's cause of the

537
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:05,099
games your fire battle right I mean yeah

538
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:07,409
they're just like less popular but and

539
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:08,789
I'm less good interesting like we play a

540
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:13,019
hearthstone and people will watch

541
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:14,339
because of our good watch and learn

542
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:15,029
where's like why the hell would I watch

543
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:17,339
his good play

544
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:19,499
batteries she sucks I'm sure he just did

545
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:20,909
like IRL streaming like people would

546
00:22:19,499 --> 00:22:22,049
still be very interested in that too

547
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:23,159
right because they don't get to see you

548
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:25,019
in that realm like they don't get the

549
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:27,869
season every day we did a little bit she

550
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:30,330
did IRL Street my best friend we went to

551
00:22:27,869 --> 00:22:30,929
Japan and we are else named a week there

552
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:32,580
right

553
00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:39,059
I know it's it's exhausting that's

554
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:41,399
exhausting because why moving if I go do

555
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:43,049
one thing like if I have like a doctor's

556
00:22:41,399 --> 00:22:45,239
appointment that like stresses me out

557
00:22:43,049 --> 00:22:46,320
like ooh bring out and going to the

558
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:56,609
doctor's appointment and coming back

559
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:58,859
Michael that was my day people uh-huh

560
00:22:56,609 --> 00:23:01,710
I'm lazy you can be a lazy extrovert

561
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:05,129
that's I look very very lazy extra

562
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:06,809
weight and I mean I liked I liked

563
00:23:05,129 --> 00:23:08,849
hanging out with Becca so that was great

564
00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:10,259
but just like you have to keep doing

565
00:23:08,849 --> 00:23:13,379
something interesting you have to like

566
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:15,239
you know go to the next place and you

567
00:23:13,379 --> 00:23:25,739
can never just sit a lot of activities

568
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:27,749
right like yeah you don't think they

569
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:30,269
would be cool with you just not doing

570
00:23:27,749 --> 00:23:32,740
much um maybe but that's not the point

571
00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:35,900
of being in Japan or like

572
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,900
[Music]

573
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:43,870
yeah well I mean I feel like at this

574
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,190
point if they're watching you long

575
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:47,380
enough it can't just because you're

576
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:50,200
skilled like they must just like you for

577
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:51,490
you and there's a basis of my viewers

578
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,750
that will watch me play anything and

579
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:57,340
that's why it's like the other people

580
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:59,740
just want to see how good you are at the

581
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:01,090
game or right something like that sure

582
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,980
for me too like when I watch certain

583
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:04,450
streamers I'm watching them to play a

584
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:08,920
game and if they play something else I'm

585
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:10,900
not interested really if you suddenly

586
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:15,160
I'm trying to think of an example for

587
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:17,800
YouTube uh-huh if you started hmm like

588
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:19,390
if you tried a singing career do you

589
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,010
think people would be as interested I

590
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:27,190
think there would be initially because

591
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:28,150
there'd be like this is funny I know

592
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:38,500
what you mean same thing with this

593
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:40,330
podcast why are you doing this but it's

594
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,820
gonna happen I mean I get it I get it

595
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:44,230
but then you might find people who are I

596
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:48,030
mean like anything you know over time

597
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:50,860
it'll build ideally they might like you

598
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:53,860
their streamers do variety all the time

599
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:55,810
right I don't think okay I'm not I

600
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,950
always say this and I'm not fishing for

601
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:59,350
compliments but I don't think I'm like

602
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:02,230
the most personable person I think I'm

603
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:04,180
okay but I think people watch me because

604
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:06,160
of my gameplay and that's okay right

605
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:08,710
like everyone has their reef they like

606
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:12,040
their niche right and they have their

607
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:17,920
strengths and like day9 can stream

608
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:21,040
solitaire or minecraft yeah I think for

609
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,150
me yeah I mean like gameplay

610
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,530
yeah people watch me because I'm good at

611
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,730
the game and I watch me because I'm like

612
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:26,980
the most entertaining person in the

613
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:31,210
world and that's fine yeah that's fine

614
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:32,830
yeah interesting that is interesting

615
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:35,890
though that's like kind of mind-blowing

616
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:37,690
to me actually I thought it was and you

617
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:40,000
like a lot of people are just naturally

618
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:42,550
drawn to you and you can make anything

619
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,300
fun right so well not necessary I'm

620
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:45,760
hacked

621
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:47,950
I've tried streaming before like a long

622
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,130
day you guys remember when um blog TV

623
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:51,410
was a thing no

624
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:54,830
okay so that was like an you stream or

625
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:56,780
on that time it was a block TV like paid

626
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:59,450
basically all these youtubers back in

627
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:01,520
the day to just stream like you don't

628
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:05,049
play games you just talk right ten years

629
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:08,450
ago right yeah and it was just the most

630
00:26:05,049 --> 00:26:10,880
awkward things it was like a minimum of

631
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:13,340
like three out to three hours like twice

632
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,160
a week and it was like the most

633
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:18,160
exhausting thing that I had to do it was

634
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,990
super awkward

635
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,010
because at the time - I didn't they I

636
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:26,179
don't think you could do the

637
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:29,000
picture-in-picture thing live like like

638
00:26:26,179 --> 00:26:30,590
show what you're doing oh I'm sure you

639
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,520
could I just most people didn't do that

640
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:36,679
or know how to do that and I just felt

641
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:41,179
like okay I'm just not a streamer I

642
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:43,520
guess I'm not good at this yeah I mean I

643
00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:44,690
think some people naturally the fact

644
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,460
that you've been doing it both of you

645
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:49,070
had been doing it for so long it's clear

646
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:51,169
that you guys I'm sure you guys realize

647
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:53,870
that you're gifted at it it's not

648
00:26:51,169 --> 00:26:55,490
something that anyone can just do I felt

649
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:56,690
really weird and awkward the first time

650
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:58,460
I streamed I think that's normal for

651
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:00,169
anything even with YouTube I'm sure it

652
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,610
wasn't completely natural at first and

653
00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:03,740
then it became natural right like it

654
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:06,140
became more and more but what I'm saying

655
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:07,549
is I think like if you really want I

656
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:09,950
feel like you have the skills to switch

657
00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:11,870
to anything don't you think because you

658
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:13,549
know thanks after doing it for so long

659
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:15,409
you know what people want to see and you

660
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:18,770
know alike you know the ins and outs of

661
00:27:15,409 --> 00:27:20,630
street listen oh yes there's there's

662
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,789
ways to do more there's always a way to

663
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:24,789
do more but you like we've talked about

664
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:27,530
the balance is like the balance between

665
00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:29,539
what you want to do and like what you're

666
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:32,289
willing to do for more right yeah

667
00:27:29,539 --> 00:27:33,740
whether that's money or viewers or

668
00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:37,010
whatever it is

669
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:38,720
mm-hmm so when you guys are not you know

670
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:41,840
I mean just chilling hanging out and

671
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,280
stuff like not streaming what else do

672
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,659
you guys like to do I know you say you

673
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,669
stay at home but I'm sure you like I

674
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:49,539
mean do you watch any of shows watching

675
00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:52,250
shows Netflix yeah that's like Oh

676
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:54,590
marvelous mrs. Mazal yeah we just

677
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:56,240
watched that is that it's a show on

678
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,970
Amazon Prime

679
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,309
it's like free free Amazon Prime users

680
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:02,690
but it's it's about like a Jewish

681
00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:10,040
comedian

682
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:12,710
cuz the girls a movie or is it oh

683
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:14,750
actually one thing that just happened on

684
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:16,670
Twitch is now you have a bounty board

685
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:19,250
where you have like sponsor deals come

686
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:22,010
directly through twitch did that for you

687
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:24,920
- probably not maybe YouTube bringing us

688
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:25,880
deals yeah yeah yeah oh okay well now

689
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,950
there's um

690
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,570
I mean twitch did that before right deal

691
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:31,490
this one's through this one's through

692
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:33,620
twitch the client there's a like there's

693
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:36,500
a page you can go do and it will show

694
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:38,330
you your rate and it'll be based off of

695
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,280
your concurrence it's like a bounty lit

696
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:43,040
like a list it's little bounty board

697
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:45,350
that's funny and it'll be like play a

698
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:48,770
trailer for like I I did one for

699
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:50,780
homecoming which is like um a new series

700
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:56,500
on Amazon Prime and all I do is watch

701
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:56,500
the trailer on my stream for free

702
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:03,710
wow this huh have you guys seen Fairy

703
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:05,660
Tail the anime no but I I think I've

704
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:07,550
watched a few episodes I couldn't get

705
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,960
into it are you into it not I mean I

706
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:10,940
watched I got into it for a little bit

707
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,490
but you got kind of repetitive that's a

708
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:14,750
um but date that's system is very

709
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:16,400
similar to that in that show they do

710
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:20,000
like a you have a board and you pick

711
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:21,290
missions requests yeah yeah but that's

712
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,480
such an interesting concept

713
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:25,850
I don't think YouTube has done that no

714
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,620
it's pretty cool it's like a it's really

715
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:29,300
nice game deal I didn't know that you

716
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:32,030
did it right though you recorded it

717
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:33,650
it'll shame you activate the bounty and

718
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,940
it will change your title for you and

719
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:36,710
then someone else

720
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,780
well I'm sure on Twitch checks that you

721
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:40,640
actually did it and then you do as many

722
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:43,460
as you want there aren't that many right

723
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:50,120
now oh I have like five available like

724
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:51,200
two or one but I mean I just asked my

725
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,150
viewers I'm like have you heard of this

726
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,970
game is is warframe any good and they're

727
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:58,970
like oh I play it it's fun I'm gonna

728
00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:01,220
play it when you do ads like that oh

729
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:02,990
they don't get upset some people are my

730
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:05,809
viewers are better

731
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:06,350
about it than his view but I don't do it

732
00:30:05,809 --> 00:30:08,210
very often

733
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:11,660
it's so crazy I would think yours would

734
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:14,690
be my viewers are kind of fickle because

735
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:16,370
like most of my viewers are from like

736
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:17,720
I'm like usually the number one or

737
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:19,550
number two spot on hearthstone so it's

738
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,230
mostly just people who don't always

739
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:27,620
watch me they just kind of watch the

740
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:29,780
game of arrival they are always number

741
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:31,190
two or number one I used I used to have

742
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:36,110
like a bunch of rivals I like made a

743
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:38,330
list of people but I want to be like to

744
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:40,429
rise up like extreme at certain times I

745
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:42,110
would try to be very entertaining no I

746
00:30:40,429 --> 00:30:47,030
don't really care as much because I'm

747
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:50,630
just kind of it's such a luxury just

748
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:53,090
again I really need to just the best I

749
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:54,920
lose like a third of my viewers if I'm

750
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:56,780
streaming while he was streaming because

751
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,970
it's like a incident right YouTube

752
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:02,540
that's I was saying before it actually

753
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:04,250
matters because like if you if you're on

754
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:08,690
and I'm on and you're bigger you're

755
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:11,330
literally taking my viewers right and so

756
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:13,460
I usually stream like the night shift

757
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:16,910
when no one's around and no one wants

758
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:19,610
that spot competition you're the number

759
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:21,140
one person at that spot number one I'm

760
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:23,360
like the number two person but it makes

761
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,890
sense though so do you find that because

762
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,260
you're doing that you have more fans in

763
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:28,910
like other countries yeah yeah no I I

764
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:31,309
looked at my demographics they have that

765
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:34,370
on Twitch and I'm still mostly American

766
00:31:31,309 --> 00:31:36,290
Muse kind of crazy time so what time is

767
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,679
this cuz you sleep it really strange

768
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:40,250
right

769
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:44,690
I try to ideally I would start around 11

770
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:46,370
or 12 st yeah yeah 11 p.m. PST and then

771
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:47,780
I would end around like 7:00 or 8:00

772
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:50,420
a.m. PST

773
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:53,150
and I'm still mostly American but I mean

774
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:54,920
I stream all I streamed every time slot

775
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:57,020
and that you can think of because I'll

776
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,559
do like 15 hours streams then that's

777
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,210
crazy

778
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:01,790
there's no way that I mean I'm hitting

779
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:03,620
every time we've learned so much I

780
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:05,270
should have been taking notes this is

781
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:07,920
like a very educate this is like not

782
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:10,560
even for like

783
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:14,280

from the she she brings the she she

793
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:48,020

794
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:48,020
a like a rope would you rather kinda

795
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:55,080
okay this question I really like I

796
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:57,150
always ask everyone and it's you have a

797
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:00,780
100 sided die so if you've ever played

798
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:04,560
while slash role okay and you roll a one

799
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:06,450
you die a painless death I wonder what

800
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:09,390
it would be if it was a painful death

801
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:10,140

802
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:12,030

00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:15,570
you roll anything else you get a million

804
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:19,230
dollars do you roll a painless death

805
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:21,030
painless death wonder how much of that

806
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:24,150
changes people's ante it changes my know

807
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:25,380
what yeah I mean I think yeah yeah I

808
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:31,950
mean if you're not getting tortured I

809
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:34,470
think I would roll really yeah million

810
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:38,370
can you up it a little bit I mean it's

811
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:40,200
yeah if you want to do torture question

812
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:43,500
like if you would roll then it would be

813
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:45,660
at what number would you not roll and if

814
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:48,030
it's like if you wouldn't roll then out

815
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:51,660
what number or what percentage what do

816
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:55,080
you know I would do I would roll for 10

817
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:59,070

00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,470

822
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:10,230

825
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:20,570
one thousand two still you still won do

826
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:22,610
it no million out do it one hundred like

827
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:29,840
this there's gotta be there's a number

828
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:32,120
out there come on hard but like even a

829
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,830
thousand yeah pretty hard but like what

830
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:37,250
do you do one in a hundred for infinite

831
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:40,310
money one in a hundred painful painful

832
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:42,440
death you know I wanna do it infinite I

833
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:45,950
would probably do it infinite money is

834
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:48,410
infinite I would probably do it well the

835
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:50,090
thing is it nothing to logistically let

836
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:52,250
people know the people know because then

837
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:54,160
your whole life becomes horrible when

838
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:56,660
you have the most money that is true

839
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:58,400
what if you just have the ability to

840
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,960
reach into your pocket and grab a

841
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:10,940
hundred-dollar bill and no one else

842
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:13,220
knows check a check check well no the

843
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:16,790
money you bought a card okay no one

844
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:20,740
knows no one knows no one knows and one

845
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:20,740
in a hundred for a very painful death

846
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:31,880
the infinite sign that's it no one knows

847
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:35,600
that even the bank I don't think I would

848
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:38,240
limit less credit card forever it's

849
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,560
doing I would do it I would do it one in

850
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,730
a hundred what if you what if you land

851
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:45,650
on it then your dad didn't know you're

852
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:48,020
not just dead you get tortured but if I

853
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:49,700
don't everyone around me their life is

854
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:52,430
it's over dude

855
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:55,520
I can buy anyone anything forever

856
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:57,440
forever would you could but you would

857
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,980
destroyed the economy and if that's not

858
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,870
kind of it factors that come each other

859
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:04,070
it is a lot of power see where were

860
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:06,790
those people when you ask those like

861
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:10,670
questions that we make we ruin the game

862
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:13,500
see taxes it's a person that just says

863
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:15,599
yes it's just like yeah okay

864
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:20,540
and then they're gonna be assassins

865
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:30,599
coming for me I could pay for bodyguards

866
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:32,460
does this last until I dam and the other

867
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:34,410
million dollar questions if you do roll

868
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,150
how many times do you roll some people

869
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:39,780
go crazy there like hunch of time till I

870
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:41,400
die for a million right you get the

871
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,320
pitiful one do you get a give the money

872
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:47,670
away if you've like you've successfully

873
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:53,040
rolled it's not like I can do this it's

874
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:57,380
not like I want to kill you for is the

875
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:59,490
die right now if we had that right now

876
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:03,119
that might convince me because chances

877
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:04,590
are is not gonna lie on a one I know you

878
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,540
don't have to roll the dice to know it

879
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:09,470
one percentage but things happen man

880
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:11,670
[Laughter]

881
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:14,790
if you had the money beforehand I would

882
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:23,900
like go to every like religious thing

883
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:27,000
and everything that is true actually

884
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:29,550
yeah I like that one that's a good one

885
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,109
yeah nobody ever heard that the

886
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:34,560
questioner they're like asking my twitch

887
00:37:31,109 --> 00:37:36,270
at is do you think for us it's a little

888
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,130
bit more personal do you think you're

889
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:41,339
the smartest or smarter than the average

890
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:44,970
person in this room so for viewing this

891
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:47,220
room I thought about that same question

892
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:48,510
before a lot of times not just in the

893
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:52,500
room but just in general

894
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:54,839
mm-hmm and so the reason I thought this

895
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,790
was because of Kanye actually and even

896
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:58,910
though some people might this is the

897
00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:02,190
easiest comparison and the most recent

898
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:05,790
even though most people think he's an

899
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:08,280
idiot and he might be maybe he is a

900
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:10,650
genius you know the fact that he can't

901
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,750
communicate it to enough people is that

902
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:14,910
still considered intelligent what I mean

903
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:16,920
is if you're like me Albert Einstein of

904
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:18,270
our generation like say you're not

905
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,160
however Highnesses you're someone else

906
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:22,710
but a genius on that level of that IQ

907
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,170
but nobody can relate to you are you

908
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:26,060
still intelligent are you still smart

909
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:31,310
because you

910
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:32,660
can't convey what what defines how you

911
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:35,300
do everyone smarten their own way right

912
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:36,770
right like you probably wouldn't be very

913
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,450
good a hearthstone right yes Martin you

914
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:40,280
a hearthstone Zach but when it comes to

915
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:47,060
YouTube content and what if them

916
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:48,440
actually really good everybody's smart

917
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,460
in certain ways I think it's a hard

918
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,380
thing to answer but if you're talking

919
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:53,330
like book smart are you talking like but

920
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:58,160
you know some people are smarter than

921
00:38:53,330 --> 00:39:00,230
others yeah they're that you know the

922
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,240
other person is smarter see but there's

923
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:03,200
some people I think of and like I really

924
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:07,160
thought up because I have thought about

925
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:09,200
this before like it's just dumb but he

926
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:11,420
has a really smart face though right

927
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,790
just like maybe there's they have to be

928
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:16,040
really good at something else that I or

929
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:17,450
maybe they're just so smart that they

930
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,800
just can't communicate to me you know I

931
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:20,690
mean like maybe they're just geniuses

932
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,370
and they do communicate that's true they

933
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:23,780
could also be like really ditzy but they

934
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:25,190
could be a straight A student in

935
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:27,560
everything they've ever done I've met

936
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:29,240
this name right so you are they stupid

937
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,100
are they smart you never know like

938
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,540
there's also the people most people who

939
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,070
are those like super smart straight-a

940
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,670
people a lot of times they don't have

941
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:44,270
common sense

942
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:48,080
so is that dumb that's a good question

943
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:49,790
actually I mean the only real like way

944
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,290
we have determining smarts is like

945
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:54,500
school right it's like the grades in

946
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:56,840
school for most people I don't know how

947
00:39:54,500 --> 00:40:09,860
does like how do I Q test work I don't

948
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:12,290
even know that's trainable for any test

949
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:13,850
yeah like you can study for the SATs and

950
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:15,320
you'll do better right right doesn't

951
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:18,110
necessarily mean you're naturally

952
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:19,520
smarter than someone yes I don't know

953
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:21,020
unless if that's what G if we were going

954
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:24,110
by numbers and it's easy that you say oh

955
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:26,750
I got a better score than you yeah maybe

956
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:29,570
if he's got score a higher IQ than your

957
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:31,430
brain is capable of achieving higher

958
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:32,660
than someone is lower that's what maybe

959
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:35,270
that's other thing is this such an

960
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:36,170
interesting topic because and I only

961
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:38,390
thought because I was running a video

962
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:39,770
bulk on you and it's not not the only

963
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:41,330
read it was before this yeah like

964
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:43,850
just writing videos in general just like

965
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:45,290
thinking like a lot of times I'll have a

966
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:47,360
script that I'm really happy with I'm

967
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:49,280
like no one's gonna get the reference

968
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:51,170
it's like no one's gonna get the it's

969
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,700
too it's too much like it's like you and

970
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:54,700
I said kind of like dumb it down I do

971
00:40:55,690 --> 00:41:00,200
that's what I'm saying it's almost like

972
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:02,420
I say dumb it down but like that's how I

973
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:04,550
see it but it's actually smarter to

974
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:07,400
people if I do it that way and it's like

975
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:09,940
if I'm trying to communicate right for

976
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:12,050
me to put out a video that less people

977
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:13,940
understand minority understands it's

978
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:15,950
actually dumber of me even though I

979
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,780
consider to be smarter because it

980
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:19,490
doesn't reach or communicates it as many

981
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:21,380
people it makes because more people can

982
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:23,119
understand it right be Dumber if you

983
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:24,950
made a joke that only two people got

984
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:27,200
right everyone be like this is not funny

985
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:28,730
it's stupid yeah but then it's but in my

986
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,060
opinion I might be like oh this is smart

987
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:34,670
because right for me this is like

988
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:36,200
brilliance yeah but at what point you

989
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:38,360
know of your genius do you realize

990
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:41,510
you're actually dumb if you can't convey

991
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:43,100
that stuff to them but you're an

992
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:45,260
entertainer that there's a difference

993
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:47,510
when you're doing it to entertain and

994
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:48,530
there's a difference between I mean like

995
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:50,750
figuring stuff out

996
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:54,710
yeah I mean just talk like I'm dumb when

997
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:58,700
it comes to cooking Dave I mean I don't

998
00:41:54,710 --> 00:42:01,220
cook so I can't really but doesn't

999
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:03,170
necessarily mean experience experience

1000
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:04,310
yeah like if you just because you don't

1001
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:06,530
know how to do something doesn't mean

1002
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:08,990
you're incapable it doesn't mean you're

1003
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:12,350
incapable but you're like dumber than

1004
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:14,359
the other person who knows if you can't

1005
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:16,609
do something well maybe they'll isn't

1006
00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:22,820
the best word so what is what is being

1007
00:42:16,609 --> 00:42:24,619
dumb then something I would say unable

1008
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:27,440
to learn I think the learning is the

1009
00:42:24,619 --> 00:42:28,850
smart play so we're people who can learn

1010
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:33,650
really fast early the smartest people in

1011
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:36,710
the world it's it's about if you're able

1012
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:39,350
to learn and to wit to what depth you

1013
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:41,720
can learn right you can learn how to do

1014
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:43,130
anything but like I could learn how to

1015
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,830
cook right but I could I learn how to

1016
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:50,030
cook like you know like could I become

1017
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:52,700
that good and I think you can yeah I

1018
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:53,539
would say dumb is kind of a relative

1019
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:56,419
term

1020
00:42:53,539 --> 00:42:58,609
- like where you are in terms of

1021
00:42:56,419 --> 00:43:02,209
learning something so like you could say

1022
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:03,979
someone is dumb who's like just hasn't

1023
00:43:02,209 --> 00:43:05,599
learned as much as you right that's kind

1024
00:43:03,979 --> 00:43:07,130
of like what we use a hard thing down in

1025
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,989
like if we're talking about us in this

1026
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:11,269
room yeah like which is the original

1027
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:13,699
question yeah I really don't I mean like

1028
00:43:11,269 --> 00:43:15,289
I like it relevant no I think about the

1029
00:43:13,699 --> 00:43:17,329
Kanye one because that one's pretty

1030
00:43:15,289 --> 00:43:19,609
interesting - well that's the thing he

1031
00:43:17,329 --> 00:43:21,649
probably I mean he describes himself as

1032
00:43:19,609 --> 00:43:24,169
a genius yeah you know and whether he

1033
00:43:21,649 --> 00:43:25,489
might be maybe we're just all not smart

1034
00:43:24,169 --> 00:43:27,079
enough to understand what he's really

1035
00:43:25,489 --> 00:43:28,549
trying to say some people do understand

1036
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:30,199
him you know you could say that about

1037
00:43:28,549 --> 00:43:32,329
where they say him Kardashian

1038
00:43:30,199 --> 00:43:33,829
all right or any of them any of the

1039
00:43:32,329 --> 00:43:35,389
Kardashians like are they dumb are they

1040
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:41,389
stupid or they're brilliant because were

1041
00:43:35,389 --> 00:43:42,829
there yeah insanely well yeah and you

1042
00:43:41,389 --> 00:43:44,539
look at how they communicate with each

1043
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:47,419
other and I think okay that's a dumb

1044
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:50,689
person but they're not dumb yeah it's

1045
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:53,499
all part of the plan I don't know like

1046
00:43:50,689 --> 00:43:57,799
this one I think a good example is like

1047
00:43:53,499 --> 00:44:00,819
Paco he's actually likes to he's

1048
00:43:57,799 --> 00:44:03,589
actually a lot smarter than he looks

1049
00:44:00,819 --> 00:44:05,630
he portrays portrays he likes to portray

1050
00:44:03,589 --> 00:44:09,439
I think it's a defense mechanism that

1051
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:14,349
he's something that he's not as smart as

1052
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:14,349
he really is a lot of people do it yeah

1053
00:44:17,109 --> 00:44:22,729
in the room yeah no but I mean like I

1054
00:44:20,299 --> 00:44:24,409
think I think it's it's it's so you

1055
00:44:22,729 --> 00:44:27,319
think maybe what I mean though what you

1056
00:44:24,409 --> 00:44:28,939
in Jenner in a general sense do you

1057
00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:30,529
think that is magnitude to Kanye West

1058
00:44:28,939 --> 00:44:32,599
and some sort like in what do you mean

1059
00:44:30,529 --> 00:44:36,319
he now that made me not a defense

1060
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:39,019
mechanism but he wants to portray yeah

1061
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:41,569
maybe maybe he's like is super like a

1062
00:44:39,019 --> 00:44:45,109
genius but yeah it could be that tracing

1063
00:44:41,569 --> 00:44:48,380
that many layers deep yeah but I I think

1064
00:44:45,109 --> 00:44:50,299
I think I don't think he I think he

1065
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:52,099
actually is like he is a really deep

1066
00:44:50,299 --> 00:44:53,599
thinker it's pretty clear than what what

1067
00:44:52,099 --> 00:44:55,789
the things that he does say yeah but

1068
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:57,109
sometimes she goes so deep into it that

1069
00:44:55,789 --> 00:45:00,049
the fact that he doesn't know how to

1070
00:44:57,109 --> 00:45:01,549
convey that to the average person you

1071
00:45:00,049 --> 00:45:03,499
know he might be a genius but I still

1072
00:45:01,549 --> 00:45:06,199
consider that dumb at that point in the

1073
00:45:03,499 --> 00:45:07,200
same way is I would not put out a video

1074
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:09,450
that I person

1075
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,980
think is really smart unless if I dumb

1076
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:12,359
it down because if it doesn't apply to

1077
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,310
people then what am i doing like I'm

1078
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:16,980
just doing a dumb thing so he's going

1079
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:24,420
too far into and he's not dumbing it

1080
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:25,859
down I think that just dumber smart

1081
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:27,780
that's the easiest way to describe it

1082
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:30,869
interesting and I think sometimes

1083
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:32,579
whether he knows you know he knows how

1084
00:45:30,869 --> 00:45:35,940
to dumb it down or he just thinks I'm

1085
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:38,040
I'm appealing to people who are thinking

1086
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:40,560
on my level I don't know why he would do

1087
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:42,810
it but clearly he knows how people react

1088
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:45,079
so he's doing it on purpose yeah you

1089
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:47,730
know lissa t but you know that too

1090
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:55,770
that's so crazy or you could just be

1091
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:58,109
dumb I mean anyone like that I feel they

1092
00:45:55,770 --> 00:46:01,349
have to be smart in certain ways right

1093
00:45:58,109 --> 00:46:03,000
but it it just depends on how you would

1094
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:06,480
define smartness I think we've already

1095
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,329
said that yeah yeah I think being smart

1096
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:12,240
and being knowledgeable are different

1097
00:46:09,329 --> 00:46:15,030
though true and I think people confuse

1098
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:18,599
it to you so how did you describe smart

1099
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:19,460
I think the process of learning process

1100
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:21,750
of learning okay

1101
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:24,599
capability of learning to be able to

1102
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:28,349
pick stuff up and then and continue to

1103
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:31,170
yeah understand things at a deeper level

1104
00:46:28,349 --> 00:46:33,180
yeah okay like the depth

1105
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:36,240
I think the depth of which they can

1106
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:37,920
understand things and learn things it

1107
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:41,760
whereas knowledge is just memorization

1108
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:43,740
in my opinion hmm but it's it also the

1109
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:47,819
ability to learn these things and convey

1110
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:50,700
it I actually think you know I think

1111
00:46:47,819 --> 00:46:52,290
because I actually think I understand a

1112
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:54,690
lot of things at a deep level but I also

1113
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:56,250
have a very hard time conveying what I'm

1114
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:59,550
thinking a lot of times I think that's a

1115
00:46:56,250 --> 00:47:00,690
different skill set right right but

1116
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:02,510
maybe you can be smarter one thing and

1117
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:04,800
dumb and the other yeah yeah

1118
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:06,150
comprehension kind of that's like what

1119
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,680
you struggle with right like you we're

1120
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:09,569
talking about this with a PhD we're just

1121
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,700
like if you read something then they ask

1122
00:47:09,569 --> 00:47:13,109
you what is it say you go well what is

1123
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:15,690
what like I just completely forgot it's

1124
00:47:13,109 --> 00:47:16,859
kind of similar yeah it's it's just that

1125
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:20,670
well that's a little different I think

1126
00:47:16,859 --> 00:47:21,180
um I think I just I think in that way I

1127
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:23,160
just learned

1128
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:25,650
different ways from other people no yeah

1129
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:27,150
I mean everyone learns differently too

1130
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:29,940
right I remember like some people are

1131
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:32,220
visual learners and some people are word

1132
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:35,040
learners and they need an index cards

1133
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:38,430
I'm definitely like visual or just do it

1134
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:39,930
and then learn yeah experience I can't

1135
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:41,099
when people explain something to me I'm

1136
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:42,210
like it doesn't even matter whether

1137
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:47,760
they're just like words that just tell

1138
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:50,430
me but uh yeah need to see it even when

1139
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:53,040
I'm like writing it's like so much

1140
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:56,640
easier if I like put things in certain

1141
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:59,700
places just visually so I can keep track

1142
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:01,740
of what's what you should show you

1143
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:03,000
should show your work I'd want to see

1144
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:05,460
how you like come up in the video

1145
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,220
oh no it's like school and it's so like

1146
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:11,640
it would not make sense

1147
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:14,160
cool it's entertaining notes and you

1148
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:16,980
just be like oh this is gibberish pretty

1149
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,480
much new just words no that's great I

1150
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:22,680
people should comment if they want to

1151
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:26,130
see that I want to one day uh take a

1152
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:28,260
screenshot or something I've had some I

1153
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:30,030
mean you you guys have seen some of like

1154
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:31,770
I make my little note cards for like

1155
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:34,920
when we do those conspiracy videos where

1156
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:37,319
everything has to connect that I

1157
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,940
literally have to draw out because it's

1158
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:41,640
just too much going on in my head to

1159
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:44,700
like figure out beginning middle end and

1160
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:48,540
all that stuff yeah I guess we're all

1161
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:50,790
visual learners then are we I don't know

1162
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:53,010
how do we I mean I mean your left hand

1163
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:54,869
is your right brained for sure but I do

1164
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:56,520
I'm ambidextrous I do everything with my

1165
00:48:54,869 --> 00:48:57,990
right that's physical yeah but you know

1166
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:00,270
your right brained cuz you're very artsy

1167
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:03,089
and you're thinking that way maybe I

1168
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:06,210
think most left-handed people are right

1169
00:49:03,089 --> 00:49:07,380
brained rights the right brain is like

1170
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:09,210
the creative side left brain is

1171
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:13,380
analytical I think I'm more left brained

1172
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:14,760
I think I am - you're definitely a

1173
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:17,400
little brain happened I think you're

1174
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:20,819
sure especially for what you do like

1175
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:22,500
analytical and Barry just like so oh my

1176
00:49:20,819 --> 00:49:26,460
god because I'm playing in a tournament

1177
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:28,200
this weekend for hearthstone and it's in

1178
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:30,470
constructed mode I usually play rina

1179
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,810
mode they're two different modes AHA and

1180
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:36,450
explain explained the

1181
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:38,490
constructed is you have 30 cards that

1182
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:42,240
you can build like you build a deck and

1183
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:44,730
you choose all 30 cards so yeah it may

1184
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:46,560
choose out of the 30 no you choose you

1185
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:48,570
have access to all the cards you choose

1186
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,980
what you want in your deck like if they

1187
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:51,450
gave you booster packs you open it with

1188
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:53,250
your packs maybe if infinite booster

1189
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:57,090
packs and you can make a deck so you can

1190
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:58,650
make the ultimate arenas different you

1191
00:49:57,090 --> 00:50:00,150
get offered like three choices and you

1192
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:04,800
pick of the three until you have a 30

1193
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:07,380
card deck right which is a draft right

1194
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:10,800
yeah yeah so I'm an expert in draft mode

1195
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:13,200
for hearthstone and so I'm trying to

1196
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:16,130
learn constructed I've played for 4 days

1197
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:19,050
now and so I have the best coach ever

1198
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:20,460
but he's been playing with me and we're

1199
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:23,670
just like talking through plays and

1200
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:25,500
sometimes I got so impressed there's

1201
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:33,980
like such a big brain sometimes

1202
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:37,830
sometimes sometimes so oh my god like

1203
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:40,470
wow to see inside that mind yeah it's

1204
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:41,670
not just like oh he's just know there's

1205
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:43,560
a there's a science to it

1206
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:52,110
I'm assuming there has to be method to

1207
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:53,910
his madness to learn anything that quick

1208
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:59,610
that big you're entering a tournament

1209
00:50:53,910 --> 00:51:06,390
that's crazy yeah yeah it's a rank I

1210
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:10,320
mean top 25 in it North America I can

1211
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:12,960
make 9 to legend in like two days which

1212
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:17,130
is a you go from rank 25 to rank 1 and

1213
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:20,250
then I drink 1 if you win there you get

1214
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:22,050
to legend and in legend like the lower

1215
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:23,790
rank legend you are it's like a ranking

1216
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:26,760
system it's certain position in the

1217
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:28,440
service ranks are like levels and then

1218
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:30,090
once you get to legend then it's like

1219
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:31,170
the higher the number that's always

1220
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:33,390
higher than the number the better this

1221
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:35,010
is in the new mode that you just rented

1222
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:36,960
yeah yeah I mean I've hit legend in the

1223
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:40,230
past but it's not what I stream it's not

1224
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:42,480
like my expertise and then I was 14

1225
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:43,500
hundredths Legend and for some reason I

1226
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,480
just kept winning

1227
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:47,940
I just kept winning and David woke up

1228
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:50,490
was like I'm ranked 400 and then the

1229
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:51,240
next day the next day I started

1230
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:53,700
streaming from like

1231
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:58,440
ring 400 and when he woke up was like

1232
00:51:53,700 --> 00:52:00,840
I'm ranked 40 mean I will say everyone

1233
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:02,370
that I've ever met that is so has some

1234
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:04,470
kind of serious interest in card games

1235
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:06,570
into some ascent mm-hmm they're always

1236
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:08,790
they always have like a very intelligent

1237
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:10,740
mind you know I think it just comes

1238
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:12,660
naturally with it maybe it's pretty good

1239
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:16,680
at all games or most games not enough

1240
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:19,200
yes as I've seen her general you have to

1241
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:21,660
be for most games you have to recognize

1242
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:23,880
Pat it it'd be smart right patterns

1243
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:26,040
because that's the only way you can

1244
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:27,780
learn like if it was always random then

1245
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:30,600
it's not really a game mm-hmm right you

1246
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:32,310
have to always find the plan you read

1247
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:34,260
the system it's actually you know yeah

1248
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:37,050
yeah you have to be pretty smart to do

1249
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:38,400
that I mean I went so I wouldn't say I'm

1250
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:40,440
like a professional high stone player

1251
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,810
because I don't compete but I play at a

1252
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:45,000
very high level for arena I'm like one

1253
00:52:42,810 --> 00:52:51,080
of the just the top rated people period

1254
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:53,640
and then but in and here a decade ago

1255
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:55,080
and I was also a competitive bloodline

1256
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:57,840
champions player which is another game

1257
00:52:55,080 --> 00:53:01,350
and I've definitely I'd love competing

1258
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:04,710
and I'm okay I'm okay at most rounders

1259
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:07,410
of games yes almost everything almost

1260
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:10,170
everything as I said some games you're

1261
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:12,420
not good at FPS so first-person shooters

1262
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:16,020
so like pubsey or something right for

1263
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:23,280
you first person yeah no its third

1264
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:26,310
person and we've read it was third very

1265
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:28,830
different I haven't played are you good

1266
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:30,720
at uh fighting games no I don't play

1267
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:32,940
okay okay I've only played so many

1268
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:35,610
genres so I started playing video games

1269
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:37,470
on his 14 and World of Warcraft was my

1270
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:39,990
first video game and I went pro in it

1271
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:42,780
talk about very fortunate addict and

1272
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:45,510
then that's a good thing

1273
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:48,930
I mean for a while he committed 14 it's

1274
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:50,670
pretty late to like start because girls

1275
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:53,160
didn't grow up playing games and I had a

1276
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:54,780
sister she didn't play games so why

1277
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:56,460
would I play games right girls looked at

1278
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:59,910
us when we play games and it wasn't cool

1279
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:03,390
back then yeah it was like a secret

1280
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:05,930
almost yeah I go home and like play

1281
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:09,000
Warcraft three years

1282
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:18,210
I wouldn't ever tell a girl yeah but now

1283
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:21,090
it's like yeah my stream more

1284
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:23,910
embarrassing but you're saying that you

1285
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:25,260
started at 14 which is actually that's

1286
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:28,110
pretty late and you went pro on your

1287
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:30,630
first game I mean I went like when I

1288
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:33,330
started playing World of Warcraft I they

1289
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:35,670
call it like keyboard turning like you

1290
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:37,890
just instead of using your mouse to turn

1291
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:39,960
use your keyboard to turn your

1292
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:42,780
characters really slow in an efficient I

1293
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:44,460
I like don't think I realized I leveled

1294
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:46,470
up until I hit like level eight and I

1295
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:49,110
just kept chained dying to like I didn't

1296
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:50,730
know anything it's it's just trying to

1297
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:52,680
do something completely new in role of

1298
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:55,020
our path was of quite complex game if

1299
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:57,360
you've never played anything before like

1300
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:59,670
just moving around and like abilities

1301
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:01,650
the whole like UI and I get user

1302
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:03,600
interface in that game is like confusing

1303
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:07,590
for someone brand new you know like I've

1304
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:10,110
played pac-man right like I could level

1305
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:13,520
up if - how do I quit bytom's like my

1306
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:18,960
friend had to tell me press Enter /w

1307
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:21,450
space you know yeah and I was really

1308
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:23,730
thrown into this world and I remember um

1309
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:27,420
when arenas first came out which is like

1310
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:29,190
the competitive mode my friends told me

1311
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:33,300
I would play with them as like teams

1312
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:34,440
before and then right before the

1313
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:36,120
expansion came out and like the mode

1314
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:38,040
came out they kicked me off the team

1315
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:40,200
before I even got to play because

1316
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:42,240
they're like wow they told me I was like

1317
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,680
a 15 year old girl and they're like we

1318
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:47,720
don't think they'll synergize well with

1319
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:50,340
us and I looked up the terms energized

1320
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:52,740
okay yeah I understand and then you went

1321
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:56,940
wrong yeah and then I vowed to beat them

1322
00:55:52,740 --> 00:56:01,740
oh you're like a villain I was so

1323
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:03,450
spiteful they got ranked 2 in the first

1324
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:05,370
week in my team I played with random

1325
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:08,040
people I got was like ranked 300 and I

1326
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:09,870
was so salty yeah like oh man

1327
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:11,550
and I was like I'm gonna beat them I'm

1328
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:14,940
gonna freakin beep and I beat them on

1329
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:18,690
the way up there yeah so in a way you

1330
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:21,090
gotta thank them for your I drove you I

1331
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:22,470
would not have tried as hard yeah until

1332
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:23,490
they were like you can't play with us

1333
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:25,830
and I was like what do you mean i can't

1334
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:27,150
play with you yeah this is exactly like

1335
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:29,430
you're in an anime you would be the

1336
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:37,290
villain that's like getting revenge and

1337
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:39,390
then you have to talk I guess you could

1338
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:41,880
also be that character too if it's a

1339
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:44,370
darker enemy I guess vengeance like a

1340
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:46,710
Kill Bill kind of thing they excluded me

1341
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:49,860
they did because I believe you actually

1342
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:53,400
I my first teammate that I hit Rank 1

1343
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:55,140
with I didn't use my microphone I didn't

1344
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:57,420
use voice chat until we had taught top

1345
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:59,670
20 Wow because my voice used to be even

1346
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:01,170
higher than it is now so I would talk

1347
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:04,680
like this and then no one would take me

1348
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:07,770
seriously and only after he was like

1349
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:09,240
whoa that's funny cuz I feel like when I

1350
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:10,590
was playing games and there was girls

1351
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:13,050
with like really high voices all the

1352
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:15,060
guys were just like do everything for

1353
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:17,580
them yeah they would do people I thought

1354
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:18,510
I was you know awesome because everyone

1355
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:22,980
