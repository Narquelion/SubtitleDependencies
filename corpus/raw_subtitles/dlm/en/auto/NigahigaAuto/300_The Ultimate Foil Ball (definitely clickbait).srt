00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,049
hey guys so most of you guys know by now

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,279
but I'm never on time for trying clearly

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:06,600
as you could probably read the title but

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,639
this time I feel like we were way ahead

5
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,410
of the game like years ago if you guys

6
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,519
watch our identity series you guys know

7
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,380
what I'm talking about okay yeah it's

8
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,670
not quite the exact trend because you

9
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,500
know we didn't actually hammer it and

10
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,420
polish it but I'm Japanese so that's

11
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,320
like half the trend you know anyway for

12
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,910
those of you that don't know what I'm

13
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,730
talking about this trend is called the

14
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,840
Japanese air polish tinfoil ball or

15
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,000
something like that it's basically just

16
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,470
taking a bunch of foil and making a foil

17
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,990
ball and feeding it up until it becomes

18
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,910
shiny and spherical sphere sphere

19
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,320
Fiera cool but for the majority of you

20
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,820
you probably already have seen this

21
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,680
trend done like a thousand times I mean

22
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,090
just searching foil on YouTube you see

23
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,040
tons of these videos just like

24
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,870
everywhere a lot of them kind of click

25
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,610
Beatty I mean it can't all be the

26
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,600
largest world breaking ball in the world

27
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,250
I mean I'm not trying to throw straight

28
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,050
you guys seen the thumbnail have like a

29
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,579
perfectly shiny ball on the thumbnail

30
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,199
that looks like perfectly round and it's

31
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,640
mirror polish to the point that it is a

32
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:55,170
mirror then you watch the video in the

33
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,579
end product is nothing like that I mean

34
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,649
if I'm not mistaken that's what

35
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,600
clickbait is right you mean like what

36
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,390
you're doing right now what the ultimate

37
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,799
foil ball sounds pretty click baby to me

38
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,320
wait how did you know I was gonna name

39
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,270
it that it's right there and seriously

40
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,010
that thumbnail you're gonna make a foil

41
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,290
ball that's the size of a person that's

42
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,760
definitely click big what what's so hard

43
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,409
about it is you just make a ball out of

44
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,210
tinfoil right I do that every single

45
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,070
time I have leftover see anyone can make

46
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,460
an ordinary ball out of tinfoil to

47
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:26,040
create a perfect mirror polished

48
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:28,979
Japanese tin foil ball one must hold the

49
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:32,030
pasta tin foil ball okay honestly how

50
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:32,030
hard could that possibly be

51
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,320
yeah no I didn't even start it yet I

52
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,790
didn't really feel like doing it so I

53
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,200
kind of just been sitting here for a

54
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:42,130
week I'll probably get started in like

55
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,130
an hour or two so

56
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,959

to until it's fall

61
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:26,020
wrap it up again and again and now you

62
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:29,860
got yourself a gold ball basically

63
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:33,610
that's always to when you idiot to get

64
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:38,790
this wrong don't know what else I can

65
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:38,790

69
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,799
the cost like a big break when they're

70
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,799
working

71
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:16,780
oh hey guys I'm finished with the song

72
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:22,030
now and now presenting the ultimate foil

73
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:23,709
ball I knew you were gonna make one as

74
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:26,170
big as the one in the thumbnail but come

75
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:27,400
on that was just sad oh this no this is

76
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:32,830
just for the swish to open the curtain

77
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:34,360
for the real foil ball what do you

78
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:40,690
really need that ball for that switch

79
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:43,080

83
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:25,200
really it's the green ball no that

84
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,760
that's all foil when you compress tin

85
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,770
foil enough it kind of loses its

86
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,620
shininess and what happens is this green

87
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:33,090
tint well it's the green ball okay fine

88
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,950
I wrap the green ball in foil but this

89
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,330
this is real this is a lot of wheat I

90
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,130
know you could make one as big as the

91
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,720
thumbnail without baking it's not fake

92
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:42,180
then where is it huh where is this

93
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,490
ultimate tin foil ball right here I just

94
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,140
told you that is not ultimate that isn't

95
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,070
even close to the size of the one in the

96
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,690
thumbnail okay

97
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,130
what are you trying to say that I'm

98
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,600
trying to say that your title is

99
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:55,890
misleading and not only is your

100
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:58,220
thumbnail fake it's a straight-up eye so

101
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:02,430
you know what that makes you a cheesy

102
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:03,840
clickbait er see I know you're gonna

103
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:06,950
make one it makes the thumbnail without

104
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,530
making it it's not fake

105
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:12,520
well except for this one but the next

106
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,520
part coming up that's all real

see pretty good thumbnail hi I told you

111
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,860
it wasn't fake but the title was still

112
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,710
misleading come on fine I'll admit it I

113
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,750
was wrong I know yes she made a real

114
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,580
ball even though it isn't as big as I

115
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:17,220
thought it would be and the contraption

116
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,590
was pretty cool so so what are you

117
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,030
trying to say this video wasn't

118
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,960
clickbait that's what I've been trying

119
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:25,370
to tell you from the start

120
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,370
see doesn't it feel nice to know that

121
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,890
see cuz when you compress tinfoil
