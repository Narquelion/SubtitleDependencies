1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:05,879
is Ryan Higa and I'm going to be

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,319
surviving all by myself in the Arctic

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:10,260
with nothing but the clothes on my back

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,910
and chest in arms and pretty much all my

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,920
clothes while teaching you the necessary

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,599
tips and techniques to survive in the

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:21,539
freezing Arctic with nothing but the

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:23,609
clothes on my back right now we're in

9
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:28,019
the Arctic this is no place for fun and

10
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:30,000
games hold on you don't know what are

11
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,920
you lost out here the Arctic terrain is

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,960
completely unforgiving if you get lost

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,550
out here you'll be sorry the Arctic

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,530
terrain won't forgive you because of the

15
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,600
unforgiving this do not want to get lost

16
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,600
out here trust me if you do up

17
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:57,550
whoa one of the toughest parts of the

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,050
Arctic is actually just just walking

19
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,950
around because of all the snow you're

20
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,180
gonna need something to help you not

21
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:02,650
sink into the snow while you're walking

22
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,720
right now I'm going to teach you how to

23
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:06,640
make your own homemade snow shoes we're

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,050
after get this big ski off when you're

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,700
lost in the wild you have to be

26
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:12,340
resourceful and make do with what you

27
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,960
have so let's make your snowshoes what

28
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,880
you want to do first close your two

29
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,950
daily tennis racquets from your jacket

30
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,420
I place them beneath your feet this is

31
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,500
gonna be like the base of your shoe and

32
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,820
actually gonna need something to tie the

33
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,400
rackets to your shoes you're gonna take

34
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:26,350
the laces from your big ski and well

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,540
unfortunately for me it seems this big

36
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,680
he has no shoelaces and you definitely

37
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,790
don't want to use the shoelaces from

38
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,440
your actual shoe because that'll make

39
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,270
your shoes look weird and you definitely

40
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,410
want that in the Arctic so what you're

41
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,940
gonna want to do from here is put the

42
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:39,160
two extra shoelaces you can't run in

43
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:41,080
your jacket and use these to tie the

44
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,060
rackets to your shoe like so this

45
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:47,490
technique may look very complicating and

46
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,490
difficult to understand and it is

47
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,100
all right now you made your snowshoes

48
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:57,080
nice and snug

49
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,610
time to get moving because we got a lot

50
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,110
of ground to cover let's go

51
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,810
the ancient natives traveled great

52
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:04,820
distances with their snowshoes some say

53
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,860
they even went as far as going to thee

54
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,750
and that's about enough for today you

55
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,580
don't ever want to dehydrate yourself in

56
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,950
a snowy terrain like this one

57
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:16,330
well the biggest parts of survival if

58
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:18,590
not the biggest staying hydrated

59
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:20,450
contrary to most belief in other

60
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,069
survival shows when you're thirsty and

61
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,730
desperate you never want to drink your

62
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:24,260
own pee

63
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:25,880
because it's sterile and absolutely

64
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,620
disgusting what you want to do is just

65
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,370
eat some snow from the ground it might

66
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,200
sound crazy

67
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,360
the ancient natives really believed that

68
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,030
snow acted is a good substitute for

69
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,709
water when in desperate times eating

70
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,510
snow in a terrain like this may bring

71
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:40,130
your body temperature to an unsafely low

72
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,989
level that's a good thing because then

73
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:43,580
you won't sweat and you won't dehydrate

74
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:45,410
again don't want to do is just eat

75
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,510
random snow because it might be dirty to

76
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:50,900
be safe always look for the yellow snow

77
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:52,519
like this one right here chances are

78
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,500
this is someone's pea and as you know

79
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:55,940
pea is very safe to drink because it's

80
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,829
sterile so what we're gonna do here is

81
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:07,030
just scoop a little bit out from the

82
00:02:57,829 --> 00:03:07,030
middle and uh - okay that's not penal

83
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:16,640
never drink from an open carton because

84
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:18,709
it may have mono I'll have to find

85
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,380
shelter soon because night is coming and

86
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:22,760
it's only gonna get colder from here the

87
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,170
cool way to tell how much time you have

88
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,670
left before nightfall is by knowing the

89
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,110
temperature see the ancient natives

90
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,459
didn't have watches like you and I so

91
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:30,170
what they would do is use temperature as

92
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:31,940
a measurement of time the colder it gets

93
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:33,350
the later it is basically the technique

94
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,030
they use is actually pretty simple what

95
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:37,760
you do is you pull out your cell phone

96
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:40,850
and what you're gonna do here just find

97
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,709
the weather app it's already it's not

98
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,850
really moving because of my gloves -

99
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:45,680
you're getting really it's pretty

100
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:47,359
difficult right now my gloves are making

101
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,010
it nearly impossible to open the weather

102
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:50,930
app and I can't take off my gloves

103
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:52,519
because my hands are cold and the last

104
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,930
thing you want in the Arctic is to be

105
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:55,100
uncomfortable you're still unable to

106
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,840
open your weather app because your

107
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,400
gloves what you want to do then is pull

108
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,080
out your daily jacket thermometer and

109
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,209
basically use a thermometer as a sort of

110
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,010
stylus or writing tool so you can open

111
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:06,439
your weather app the ancient natives

112
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,060
this technique from the Nintendo DS as

113
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:09,230
you can see yeah almost no problems at

114
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,599
all it's working phenomenally

115
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:13,280
phenomenally is a big word there you go

116
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,450
as you can see it actually this is the

117
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,549
coldest I've ever seen it before it's

118
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,750
negative 1 degrees Celsius at for you

119
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:20,030
Americans I believe that anywhere

120
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,100
between 20 to 75 degrees for googly

121
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:26,120
that's really cold so we really need to

122
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:28,220
get moving but as a day drags on I find

123
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,229
neither food nor shelter my feet are

124
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,760
starting to bark my nipples meta parting

125
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:33,229
and I'm going to think I bit off a

126
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,260
little more than I could chew this time

127
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:38,810
you know being out here all this time

128
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:41,419
and it's only been like 30 minutes but

129
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:44,090
I'm starting to feel like giving up it's

130
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:45,500
hard to lose hope but then I remember

131
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,380
well my grandfather's only son of my

132
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,630
dad's side always told me son it's an

133
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,630
ice box you open it get what you want

134
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:54,949
close it I'll stop poisoning electricity

135
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:56,000
and after all this time I never really

136
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:58,490
understood what he was talking about

137
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,919
until right now he was talking about

138
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,630
here he was talking about the Arctic how

139
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:04,880
I should never give up I should

140
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:06,880
persevere how I need to never back down

141
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:11,710
and just never give up get out of here

142
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,710
buddy get out of here get it out of here

143
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,480
yeah

144
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:43,390
