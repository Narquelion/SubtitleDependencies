called you guys over I think I finally

9
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,529

God we're doing another one of these I

11
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:22,380

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,599
about first thing you're gonna do is

15
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,300
pull a lever or press some secret button

16
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,949
and bail your super-secret lab they're

17
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,719
gonna have to listen to your conspiracy

18
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:35,040
theories for hours dude what are you

19
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,290
talking about I was just talking about a

20
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,329
breakthrough on this case wait is that

21
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,250
my Sookie oh yeah friend to tell you had

22
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,079
to borrow it for the pun you drill a

23
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,360
hole in my suitcase why would you do

24
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,500
that I just told you for the pun yeah

25
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,629
because of the hole is like the

26
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,489
breakthrough and their cases I don't get

27
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:52,079
it sha and also I needed it to gain

28
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:55,520
access to my secret labs so that we can

29
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,520
start the next crazy conspiracy theory

30
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:04,100
well what what is your secret laughs oh

31
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,449
that's in the other room then why did

32
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:10,210
you have to drill a hole in my taste

33
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:14,930
what was all that for huh to open it oh

34
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:17,960
oh there it is

35
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:20,240
now we can get into the secret lab when

36
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,460
you delete the any other room all right

37
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,040
as you guys can see here been working

38
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:29,720
pretty hard this new conspiracy proving

39
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,860
the earth is actually flat cool where

40
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,930
did that come from

41
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,580
but it doesn't matter are you serious

42
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:36,380
are you doing all this because of the

43
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,880
kind of arrogance equate who you know

44
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,350
Kyrie Irving who famous basketball

45
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,700
player that came out said that ye also

46
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:42,080
believe the earth is flat it's

47
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,759
ridiculous she all said it was

48
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,170
ridiculous to do I do a little bit of

49
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,610
research and father there's actually a

50
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:49,160
lot of people that believe it yeah and

51
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:51,050
they're ridiculous and I and one of them

52
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,820
no you gotta be kidding this is a real

53
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,770
thing okay people actually believe that

54
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,450
the earth is flat the called flat

55
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,590
earthers what they believe is that the

56
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,479
government has actually tricked people

57
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,830
into thinking that are this round from

58
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:03,500
the time you're a little kid okay how do

59
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:06,140
you explain actual satellite photos of

60
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,759
Earth Photoshop editing okay well what

61
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,679
about people who actually traveled the

62
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,030
entire close going in circles not around

63
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,739
the whole thing meaning I'm not gonna

64
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,480
lie this one is kind of hard to believe

65
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:15,920
exactly why would the government want to

66
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,330
lie about the shape of the earth she

67
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,160
that's exactly it they're hiding the

68
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,959
truth from us the truth so mind-blowing

69
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,000
that if people found out the whole world

70
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,780
who come to an end I am this close to

71
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,780
figuring it out

72
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:34,230
what are you doing on school right

73
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,460
that's um Spencer's love Spencer all

74
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,140
right let's go back to the very

75
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,370
beginning Kelly you see in the beginning

76
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,840
everybody thought that the earth is flat

77
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,220
but who were the first people to

78
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,380
actually suggest that the earth was

79
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,150
round ancient Greek philosophers and

80
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,560
these philosophers have discovered a ton

81
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,690
of things that we live by well why don't

82
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,130
we ever question them duration for

83
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,480
example ancient Greek philosophers are

84
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,800
the same people who have discovered

85
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,570
conservation you know the idea of

86
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,280
connecting stars to make pictures like

87
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,380
the Big Dipper or zodiac signs

88
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,700
I'm Emil I'm uninterested but if you

89
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,720
weren't thought about this as a kid and

90
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,280
you were just a look at these pictures

91
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,420
it looks nothing like what they claimed

92
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,870
it to be you mean this looks like a

93
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,520
child

94
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,840
connect the dots one more from our class

95
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,310
which by the way here she should

96
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,210
probably get an end fork so it's nothing

97
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:14,130
like a fish sorry Homer combo look I

98
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,810
agree consolations don't always look

99
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,980
like weather supposed to be but what is

100
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,140
that have to do with anything we're

101
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,910
talking about planets not scar that's

102
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,890
exactly it but if it's both see our

103
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,510
solar system is made up of one gigantic

104
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,430
star and a bunch of planets orbiting

105
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,380
around it kidding this each of these

106
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,270
planets are actually just points in one

107
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,800
big constellation see there's always

108
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,120
been rumors and questions by people

109
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,130
including Sciences that believe that if

110
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,390
at any point all the planets align the

111
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,500
world will come to an end that's the

112
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:41,760
constellation they're trying to hide

113
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:43,620
from us I call within just Sun why not

114
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,900
Mercury Venus Earth Mars Jupiter Saturn

115
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,970
Uranus Neptune that's to me is only that

116
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,650
sign a modern day human how is that

117
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,810
supposed to be human being it's a

118
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,750
straight line looks like a somebody test

119
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,430
or class right what does this have to do

120
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,660
with proving that the earth is flat at

121
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,460
all all right let me point out the

122
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,200
obvious was it two more vital things

123
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,920
that humans need to survive I don't know

124
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,930
your brain

125
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,340
yep and your heart exactly your brain

126
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,540
your heart are the two most important

127
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,010
things you need to live just like the

128
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,360
two most important things that you guys

129
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,820
need to live in our solar system is the

130
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,390
Earth and the Sun located exactly where

131
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,010
they should be

132
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,510
in a constellation if some powers

133
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,980
everything in our solar system just like

134
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,480
our brain doesn't yes we can't survive

135
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,040
without the earth which is literally an

136
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,570
anagram for hard if you just move the H

137
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,100
at the front okay but what about the

138
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,140
other how to hell the mercury

139
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,480
represented bait actually it represents

140
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,950
your mouth why the Sun is ahead as we

141
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,080
all know the Sun gives up an incredible

142
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,729
amount of heat and

143
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,169
your head is feeling extremely hot what

144
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:34,280
does that mean you're saying precisely I

145
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:36,199
mean you're sick you go and get a

146
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,960
thermometer I put it where in your mouth

147
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:40,639
geometers are made of mercury exactly

148
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,990
remember this constellation wasn't

149
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,729
created today it was created a fairly

150
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,080
long time ago back in the day it didn't

151
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:46,129
just stick a thermometer in your mouth

152
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,780
check your temperature

153
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:49,849
really where else would you see the

154
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,069
Khedive your anus it couldn't be more

155
00:04:49,849 --> 00:04:53,719
obvious Uranus is literally slow

156
00:04:52,069 --> 00:04:55,430
vengeance on Venus which means that it's

157
00:04:53,719 --> 00:04:57,229
mercury is a mouth and Uranus is the

158
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,759
anus and we can figure out everything in

159
00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:00,319
between by looking at a regular human

160
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:01,729
body what is good a little the mouth but

161
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,830
about the heart your throne for your

162
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:05,240
next test Venus and since Saturn is

163
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,069
right above Uranus that must be your

164
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,050
hips or your butt you'll explain why it

165
00:05:07,069 --> 00:05:12,050
has that big pool of cooper on its body

166
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,759
right we go back up to Mars which again

167
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,590
is just another anagram for arms pretty

168
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,270
self-explanatory and Neptune is just

169
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,830
basically everything below your image so

170
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,509
it has to be your legs as for Cupid I'm

171
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,430
not quite sure I mean obviously some

172
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:23,779
agreements between cars hip area since

173
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:25,310
Jupiter's the biggest of them all

174
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:26,750
there's a little more to it it's not

175
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,150
just the normal stomach they're saying

176
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:30,740
that it's a huge stomach a huge stomach

177
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,000
meaning that the venture Sun has

178
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,919
something to do with the process of

179
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,330
eating really meanwhile so they make the

180
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,680
stomach that being and when you really

181
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:39,050
look at it it does just look like a

182
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,000
digestive tract time so what about Pluto

183
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,770
is Pluto used to be considered a planet

184
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,360
but now it isn't so what is that like

185
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,159
his toe or something and it somehow

186
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,529
disappeared wait a second

187
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:50,300
it did disappear who don't look and

188
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:51,440
actually attach to the body but it

189
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,330
represents the most human-like

190
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,990
characteristics that leads us to our

191
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,909
next step

192
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:58,940
are you talking about yeah I'm not too

193
00:05:55,909 --> 00:06:00,800
sure you think Pluto in the park it was

194
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,940
in summer to read on Venus passing Earth

195
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,259
and Mars oh just an interpreter

196
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,789
preparing for takeoff from Saturn and

197
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:06,909
boom right on your anus flying past

198
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:08,060
Neptune off of the space before what

199
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:10,490
disappears

200
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,020
you really expect anyone to believe this

201
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,310
I believe this I mean there's literally

202
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,139
a picture right in front of you don't

203
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,599
you see it it's a line well like I said

204
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:19,069
earlier did you get an F in our class no

205
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,569
well then you don't have the eye of a

206
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:22,430
Greek philosopher so you can't see it

207
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:24,560
probably just like how you didn't see

208
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:27,860
that having an F in art literally spells

209
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,629
up for [ __ ] for I can't believe you're

210
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,950
resorting to fart jokes isn't have joke

211
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:32,540
what don't you understand

212
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:35,330
I understand a lot of things like best

213
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,460
and sign okay you want back some science

214
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,020
I'll prove it to you you already know

215
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,540
that a Florida's simply gas that comes

216
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,640
from Uranus Uranus has 27 moons a third

217
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,050
most in our solar system is do you think

218
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,850
that when you expose your buzzes someone

219
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,050
is called morning then you did it right

220
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:50,030
there why are you talking about your

221
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,100
anus when it has a third most moved on

222
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,690
to talk about Jupiter or Saturn at us

223
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,280
there's a reason why Uranus is right

224
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:57,860
number three for the most moons know

225
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,230
exactly the biggest and gas hissing in

226
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,850
our solar system the Sun you see the Sun

227
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,770
is literally a gigantic ball of burning

228
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,240
gas made up of mostly hydrogen helium

229
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,040
and a bunch of other random elements

230
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,660
such as carbon nitrogen and oxygen when

231
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,910
you add the atomic number of P to these

232
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,500
elements you end up with 24 3 sure the

233
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,150
number of moons that you represent and

234
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,460
what was your anus ranked on the list of

235
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:19,280
clans to the most moons that's right 3

236
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:21,110
bringing us to 2017 that number of moons

237
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,000
and Uranus heads so we know that your

238
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,740
age is connected to the Sun that's not

239
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,420
the only one usually right all the times

240
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,340
backwards there's only two planets that

241
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:31,850
are connected to the Sun Uranus as we

242
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:33,410
already know and one more Venus the why

243
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:35,120
Venus out of all the planets why not

244
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,590
Mars we all know the saying men are from

245
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,600
Mars and women are from Venus because

246
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,550
Mars or men have always been their way

247
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,110
to distract us from the truth which

248
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,940
lives of women or more specifically

249
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:46,310
Venus think about it why is the stars

250
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,720
called the Sun and not the daughter yeah

251
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,790
why don't we call the beginning of the

252
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,370
week Sunday well why is it called

253
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:54,290
another [ __ ] but not daughter of awake

254
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,770
which you can be saying that on this

255
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,630
channel

256
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,340
what's the family channel why not they

257
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:01,840
say it on TV all the time if they don't

258
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:04,010
stay on my authority Explorer

259
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,980
I'm a [ __ ]

260
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:08,600
we we are we are updated now you see

261
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,400
[ __ ] by definition actually means

262
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,410
female dogs we know I was thinking about

263
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,930
yes it is because the novel has to cut

264
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,640
this part out but males are just called

265
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,410
dogs so doesn't that make you wonder why

266
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,040
you wouldn't even call a female dog a

267
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,290
[ __ ]

268
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,730
no exactly it's very intrigued you've

269
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,860
heard of a female before right you know

270
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,520
the one that leads to pack in beta one

271
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,990
that's impossible

272
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,120
what about that's just like everything

273
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,120
else in our world betas gravitate toward

274
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,070
health investment dogs with humans

275
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,140
planet moon orbits the earth and the

276
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:37,450
earth orbits the Sun although alpha and

277
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,130
beta a and B before you go on please do

278
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,820
we at least take the sign down it's a

279
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:42,310
little event

280
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:44,320
what's the a [ __ ] line to not no no

281
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:46,150
it's not a [ __ ] remember because the a

282
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,820
is else when the B is beta so but B

283
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:51,910
gravitates for the a and making average

284
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:53,529
there's a group what ABS are obviously

285
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,940
referring to your stomach and an itch is

286
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:55,690
just discomfort so it's stomach

287
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,520
discomfort

288
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,990
hey remember there's a reason why

289
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,540
they're distinguishing between men and

290
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:04,600
women it's just a last step to proving

291
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,550
my theory thank God I can treat those

292
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,740
discomfort specifically for a woman and

293
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:10,330
only a woman can only mean one thing

294
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,490
pregnancy the creation of lemons however

295
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,900
because men can get right is the only

296
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:16,060
thing that sells it'll ferment

297
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:19,270
approximately mean is something we

298
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:22,420
already know and so far for our babies

299
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:25,570
I'm then because women don't worry again

300
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:27,880
for the villages sighs how does a part

301
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:29,589
prove that the earth is flat look it's

302
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,140
simple giving birth is the creation of

303
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:33,160
life to a human being but a fart is much

304
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,320
much bigger than that

305
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,180
lot of this we're right all along the

306
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,730
earth is flat that's not the only thing

307
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:41,260
to Sun all the other planets everything

308
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:45,220
in our entire solar system the entire

309
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:49,209
universe oh because it's all Fletcher's

310
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:50,230
hey can you stop doing that what I'm not

311
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:52,060
letting it end like this

312
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:53,589
not getting away with this morning away

313
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,150
with it I just proved it the earth is

314
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:56,620
flat its regiment special in screams

315
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,420
farting don't worry I had to look it up

316
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:00,220
to on going get it Sean and what are you

317
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,940
confused about it all adds up the Big

318
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,339
Bang

319
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,170
what is the fart made of gas just like

320
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:06,520
the Sun yeah but see that's the Sun and

321
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,560
we're talking about the earth and the

322
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,450
earth isn't made of gas it's a solid

323
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,970
which indicates all of your logic and

324
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:14,980
props you for doing all of this but that

325
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:18,010
does not prove that the earth is glass

326
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,610
it is true yes that means the earth is

327
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,980
in the fart

328
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:24,570
thank you it's a solid form I thought

329
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,570
about what about your fish it
