1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
hey guys so I know it is that time of

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,980
the year again where everybody who's

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,960
kind of similar to me is once again left

4
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,010
out because we are single valentines day

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,660
if you didn't catch that and I actually

6
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,460
wasn't planning to do a Valentine's Day

7
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,840
video this year because it's always the

8
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,340
same thing every year I'll be your

9
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,420
Valentine ROI it's awesome but I don't

10
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,130
really know you but you're not even

11
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,510
really sick yes I am how are you still

12
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,010
single because I spend all my time

13
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,869
talking to myself I what's wrong with

14
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,430
that nothing at all okay good does that

15
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:29,250
love you love you too Ruth it kiss me

16
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:31,109
okay yeah anyway I was thinking about

17
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,579
what do I usually do on Valentine's Day

18
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:34,140
and what am I gonna do this Valentine's

19
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,910
Day and then it just digging like a

20
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,530
light bulb that turns on from a snap

21
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,120
apparently my Valentine's Day is my

22
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,280
video game that's been my relationship

23
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,719
the past few years every Valentine's Day

24
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,129
I end up playing video games because all

25
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,660
my other friends are busy so rather than

26
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:46,800
trying to pretend that I'm in something

27
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,239
that I'm not which is a real

28
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,440
relationship I decided to write some

29
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,239
poems for all the people that are like

30
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,530
gaming love form there's one of those

31
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,940
moments where I got really excited and

32
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,680
just started writing without thinking

33
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,329
this makes absolutely no sense

34
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,129
especially if you don't play any games

35
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:00,210
you might not get any references in this

36
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:01,350
video and if I don't mention your

37
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,969
favorite game maybe I'll do it another

38
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,530
time but these are the games that I play

39
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,360
or the games that I know so for all you

40
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,070
gamers out there's poems are for you and

41
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,200
they're also for people to give to

42
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:18,420
gamers I guess if that being said here's

43
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:19,770
a friggin ridiculously weird video so

44
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,880

45
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,170

46
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,790

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,240

00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,280
Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet there's

100
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,300

00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:01,600
Romeo and Juliet our families will fight

105
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:04,239
they know not of all love they know not

106
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,340
of our lives we must meet in secret so

107
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,890
I'll write to you in riddle behind box

108
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,260
where cats walk weird or smoke in the

109
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:13,780
middle and when you arrive take my hand

110
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,880
we'll survive in the darkness of tunnels

111
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,310
like our love we will hide all the

112
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,889
memories will share Lowell tunnels by

113
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:23,020
stairs but in trouble draws near when

114
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:25,900
both families head here and as they

115
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:30,900
approach faster than p90s fire we know

116
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,900
all that is left last kiss we desire

117
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:39,800
and as they close in

118
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:47,229
there's one last decision CS go with the

119
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:47,229
blade name see us gold grenade yay

120
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,659
sometimes less is more and the proof is

121
00:04:59,829 --> 00:05:02,199
in Minecraft this poem gets straight to

122
00:05:01,659 --> 00:05:05,289
the point

123
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:07,889

does not love them back and this is how

130
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:26,499
you can win them over with this story of

131
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:29,079
Slenderman that was so creepy we're in

132
00:05:26,499 --> 00:05:31,479
love you don't know it I watch you from

133
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:33,459
afar the darkness of the night as you

134
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:35,679
walk home through the park you turn on

135
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:38,829
your cell phone to give yourself light

136
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:41,589

still give a hug but you keep on going I

140
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:54,239
guess that ends our date until next time

141
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:54,239
my love I'll be waiting at your place

142
00:05:57,329 --> 00:06:00,909
last but not least I'm not gonna forget

143
00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:01,569
all the people who actually are in a

144
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:03,369
relationship

145
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:05,139
fighting is inevitable it's gonna happen

146
00:06:03,369 --> 00:06:06,879
and this poem based off of Super Smash

147
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:08,739
Brothers is for all you couples who have

148
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,019
been together for a very long time I

149
00:06:08,739 --> 00:06:12,849
know that we fight and we argue a lot

150
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:14,949
you see I game every night without

151
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:17,409
giving a thought about you and me but

152
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:19,479
that's simply not true when I play Super

153
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:21,759
Smash Bros all I think about is you cuz

154
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:24,459
it's just like your peach spoiled

155
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,499
princess and whiney or maybe your Zelda

156
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:28,119
yelling at link to come find me when I

157
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:29,769
play as King Bowser it's like I'm

158
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:31,959
playing as you and you're hungry you're

159
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:33,699
tired or in a bad mood and like Kirby

160
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:35,889
and Jigglypuff you eat and then sleep

161
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:37,719
but when you wake up your breath is like

162
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:39,150
Donkey Kong's feet you're Mega Man and

163
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:40,979
Samus at the end of the day

164
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,600
you build up your rage and take it all

165
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:44,520
out on me and it makes me feel like

166
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,350
Sonic because I want to run from it all

167
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,360
fly away like a Charizard or like

168
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:50,490
Captain Falcon and fall but then I

169
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,080
remember you're not just a character in

170
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,540
this game you're my player number two

171
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,699
and no matter who you are we're on the

172
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:59,430
same team so although you may whine like

173
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:02,010
you are my mother although you annoy me

174
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:03,870
like a little brother although you may

175
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:07,320
smother me like no other

176
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:12,000

177
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:14,850
