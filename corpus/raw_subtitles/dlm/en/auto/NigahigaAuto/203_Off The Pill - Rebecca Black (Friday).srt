00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,540
hey guys so I just watched that video

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:05,910
called Friday by Rebecca Black when I

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,400
was in a loss for words for words what

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,440
the hell with that the song is terrible

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,570
the lyrics are terrible and I became

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,429
tear Abel because the song is exactly

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,410
like the music I make I'm just like

8
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,119
Rebecca Black I can't sing so I oughta

9
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,560
to myself when I write lyrics I

10
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:21,570
basically just talk about what I do on a

11
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,070
daily basis and yes the crap I put out

12
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,830
gets a million views but dean army of

13
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,090
you she got more so unlike everyone else

14
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,769
I'm not gonna say that she's a failure

15
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,810
because she has over thirty five million

16
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:33,210

17
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,480

20
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,000

23
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:53,550
I do look forward to the weekend

24
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,370
especially if I get the party with the

25
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:58,890

26
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,050

27
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,489
right by my mathematics and today we're

28
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,809

29
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:05,729
