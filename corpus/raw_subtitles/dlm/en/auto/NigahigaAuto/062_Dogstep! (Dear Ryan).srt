techniques so for those of you that

22
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,219
haven't watched my drop my life and for

23
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,840
those of you that don't know since I was

five years old I did judo my whole life

going up when I did judo everybody's

26
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,270
like why lunge take karate or like

27
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,340
Taekwondo judo was never a popular sport

28
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,739
only up until recently since the rise of

29
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,780
like Ronda Rousey's Steudle be even been

30
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:59,670
considered like a legit sport I feel

31
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,440
like Sean and I are actually both black

32
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,090
belts in judo crazy right doesn't mean

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,040

35
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,990
white belts with sharpies black belts

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,790

right here and a scar right here

71
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:45,450
actually I was getting attacked by

72
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,190
ninjas one day and I'm not even gonna

73
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,989
bother this is a true story a story I'm

74
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,430
necessarily proud of when I was 6 years

75
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:51,900
old I was in the first grade I remember

76
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,280
I was riding my bike with a bunch of my

77
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,320
neighborhood friends you know at the

78
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,060
time there was this stunt daredevil guy

79
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,820
called Evel Knievel you guys don't know

80
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,620
who he is he did a bunch of crazy stunts

81
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,820
on his motorcycle and basically I wanted

82
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,050
to be him I thought that was like the

83
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,430
coolest thing in the world there was a

84
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,380
few of my neighborhood friends and we're

85
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,720
all riding our bike on my street there's

86
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,160
this gigantic ditch she about a six foot

87
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,810
six and a half foot drop and I don't

88
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,400
know where I rode my bike straight

89
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,080
towards the ditch tried to lift up the

90
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,239
handlebars try and do a backflip and

91
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,519
land but it did not quite go that way so

92
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,590
instead I did kind of like a half

93
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,269
backflip and halfway through towards the

94
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,000
end I was like oh my god I'm gonna fall

95
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:29,700
instead of bailing I turned sideways and

96
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,680
basically I landed exactly on this arm

97
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,720
and completely broke my arm

98
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,829
I got it casted and apparently I don't

99
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,630
know something went wrong with the

100
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:38,410
casting so the time I was high school

101
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:40,000
kept having these wrist issues like

102
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,860
every time I just bent it a little it

103
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,600
started to hurt when I got x-ray Tyria

104
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,520
they realized that you know from that

105
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,140
first injury an arm got messed up what

106
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,880
they had to do this because his mom was

107
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,500
longer what they had to do is they had

108
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,420
to cut all the way through the bone and

109
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,830
take out a chunk of bone to make this

110
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,300
bone shorter that's why there's big

111
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:57,190
slices there and then what they did is

112
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,080
they went in and they attached a metal

113
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,520
rod to the two bones so that the bones

114
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,080
would heal properly and then they put

115
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,610
another metal rod in here you know I had

116
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,290
metal in my arm for like a like two

117
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,910
years some metal actually still in there

118
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,320
but actually really self-conscious about

119
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,790
this I used to always like wanna wear

120
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,170
long sleeve shirts nothing you can do

121
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,430
about it's like it couldn't it could be

122
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:15,490
worse you could have a scar and your

123
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:17,620
frickin nose dear Ryan go to hell and

124
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:20,290
kill yourself wait you want me to go to

125
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,910
hell first and then kill myself it

126
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,290
doesn't make any sense do you even do

127
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,030
that as if you're in hell you're already

128
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,770
dead can you even kill yourself in hell

129
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,240
there's no way you can go to hell if

130
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:34,690
you're still alive that doesn't make any

131
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:37,450
sense unless oh my god this is hell

132
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:41,080
Jesse though dear I make a freestyle rap

133
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:42,730
um I don't know how to do that my

134
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,860
rapping is basically fifth-grader poetry

135
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,480
I just look for words that rhyme as fast

136
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,590
as I can and then I just even if it

137
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,450
doesn't make sense I'll just say it

138
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:52,300

139
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:55,150
