hard to be a really good boy and even in

68
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:09,569
order to blow someone's mind all you

69
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:11,910
have to do is recite the infamous porn

70
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:13,919
if roses are red and violets are blue

71
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,480
and by the commutative property the

72
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:17,039
color blue is actually violated and what

73
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,630
two colors make violet red and blue

74
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:20,250
which means you need red to make violet

75
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,750
and since file it is actually blue that

76
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,849
means you need red to make blue but what

77
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,139
makes red the past tense of read because

78
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:27,270
the word you read more than any other

79
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,550
word so far in this equation blue you

80
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,169
read blue creating violet and because

81
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,000
violets are actually blue it proves that

82
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:34,770
not only that I just blow your mind but

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,900
everything you just read past tense

84
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:41,180
actually just blew your mind

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:57,070
