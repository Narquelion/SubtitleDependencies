2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:08,000
introducing the all-new

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:11,440
completely redesigned iphone 7

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,960
iphone 8. when we released the iphone 7

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,400
people complained that it was basically

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,920
the same thing as the six just that we

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,359
added another camera but this time we

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,439
made sure that wasn't the case

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,600
we added two more cameras to give us the

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,119
first ever quad camera experience people

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,439
who think it's stupid or unnecessary to

12
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,039
have

13
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,720
four cameras on one phone just don't

14
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,320
understand that now with the quad camera

15
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,080
you can take one picture and you'll have

16
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,439
four of that same exact picture you can

17
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,559
never do that before just think about

18
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,320
what you could do with that if you're a

19
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:34,960
parent of quadruplets you don't need to

20
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,320
get all of them

21
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,840
sit still for a picture you just need

22
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,440
one you take two pictures you got the

23
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,040
point of view of a spider just like that

24
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,480
you don't have to take eight individual

25
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,719
pictures anymore i mean even for video

26
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,000
the video resolution alone you film 1k

27
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,360
you're shooting 4k now which is kind of

28
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,960
one of the main reasons why we went from

29
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,239
the dual cam straight to the quad cam

30
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,520
and skipped the tri-cam because you know

31
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,800
if you film with the tri-cam the

32
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,480
resolution is a little

33
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,079
well too samsung for us it's a little

34
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,000
too edgy last thing we want is people to

35
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,520
get heated over this and explode on us

36
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,120
you know another thing that people

37
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,039
really criticize us for when we released

38
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,640
the 7 was the lack of new iphone colors

39
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,159
even though we did introduce two new

40
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,520
colors black and jet black

41
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,040
people still weren't pleased for some

42
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,400
reason so this time around in addition

43
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,760
to the original colors we're also

44
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,760
announcing a bunch of new and fresh

45
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,680
colors for the iphone 8 ranging from

46
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,560
matte black to shiny matte black light

47
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,479
skin brother black

48
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,080
jack black jack black on a hot day look

49
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,400
i could keep going but we'd be here all

50
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,920
day

51
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,759
just know that all these new colors will

52
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,400
never get old because they're all black

53
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,920
and black black don't crack and even

54
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,000
with all the things we announced so far

55
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,680
the craziest thing about the iphone 8

56
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,600
the price you ready for this we are

57
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,640
pricing the iphone 8 at exactly one

58
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,799
dollar one dollar

59
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,000
it's pretty much free i mean of course

60
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,439
there are a few add-ons that you're

61
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,960
going to need just like the 7 the iphone

62
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,000
8 doesn't have any headphone jack so if

63
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,119
you want to use headphones you have to

64
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,840
buy the wireless ones

65
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,640
not a big deal we did change the charger

66
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,399
port again

67
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,159
we actually added two more charger ports

68
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,360
to make it faster all three parts are

69
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,640
different so you have to get all three

70
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,000
different chargers and actually they

71
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,680
don't plug into the wall anymore they

72
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,119
only plug into our three new macbooks so

73
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,719
you have to get those as well a couple

74
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,840
more fun new features for the iphone 8

75
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,600
we also took all the lighting

76
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,880
capabilities out of the iphone so you'll

77
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,840
have to purchase the eye light if you

78
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,840
want to use flash or

79
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,439
flashlight on the phone we made it a lot

80
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,399
easier to text and write messages with

81
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,440
the iboard so

82
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,959
your phone actually doesn't have a

83
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,400
keyboard anymore you actually need the

84
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,920
iboard if you want to write anything the

85
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,440
iphone 8 comes with the premium color

86
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,360
version of every app so you also have to

87
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,280
purchase youtube red and facebook blue

88
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,720
and snapchat yellow and so on

89
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,480
also if you want any reception or

90
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,920
internet of any kind you'll need the i

91
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,360
cell phone tower mini this one is

92
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,959
actually not wireless so that the

93
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,840
internet's faster so you have to bring

94
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,840
it wherever you go

95
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,440
also siri is no longer in the phone we

96
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,010
actually made her external so you have

97
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:39,290
to buy a person as well

98
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,290

99
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,599
oh and i almost forgot to mention one of

100
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,879
the biggest new features we developed

101
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,760
unlike the seven which is only water

102
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,040
resistant we

103
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,640
finally developed a way to make the

104
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,239
iphone completely waterproof all i have

105
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,000
to do is use our new highly advanced

106
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,959
iphone case called the

107
