159
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,190
for the man I'm falling in love with the

160
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:08,720
craft and that's the story yeah you're

161
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,080
right I don't agree I don't remember any

162
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,690
of that

163
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,730
I remember Greg brought up like when

164
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,290
you're asking about camera gear and he's

165
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:18,110
like telling you stuff is like why you

166
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:20,060
know is good camera gear for ya the

167
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,320
Canon 7d he was big

168
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,570
yeah he was jealous because at the time

169
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,640
it's like riot like whatever Ryan said I

170
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:27,320
was like yes I will do it like you're

171
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,690
you know the master you're teaching me

172
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,550
and he was like you should get a camera

173
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,850
I used this one so I just got a canon 17

174
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:36,620
I didn't know how to turned on but uh

175
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:38,750
you know Greg was really envy of that

176
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,220
cuz he wanted a camera that was his

177
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,750
dream it was his dream

178
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,780
Gregg the guy with the moustache one who

179
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:46,310
edits for us he that was his dream

180
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,230
camera and couldn't afford it and then

181
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:49,760

182
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,160

183
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,680

a lot of use with that camera

186
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:01,760
you started YouTube and you created like

187
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:03,020
a huge channel oh yeah but big part of

188
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,600
that's cuz of Ryan he just would like

189
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:08,630
the videos back then and then my channel

190
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,880
exploded and yeah thanks Ryan you did

191
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,710

192
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,240
thing and you built your kind of built

193
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,710
your following but you also had that you

194
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,210
were still in the dance community like

195
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:19,160
heavily in the dance community and

196
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,680
that's why you've got your TV show but

197
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,150
not your show but you judged on

198
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,050
America's Best Dance Crew yeah and I

199
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,490

following is a huge you know outlet and

204
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,110
I was like again that's because of right

205
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,600
Ryan

206
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:38,060
Brian's basically my Jesus Christ he

207
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:45,760
saved me and I Bernie Goetz smited my

208
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:45,760
career you're gonna get smited anyway

209
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:57,770
what I find amazing what I find amazing

210
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:59,510
is that you know you're you're a dancer

211
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,740
right that's what you start off as and

212
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,900
you're still known as a dancer you're

213
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:06,979
still in that community that you created

214
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:08,330
such a like a successful career centered

215
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:09,560
around dancing and that's something that

216
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,750
there's so many dancers in the world

217
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,450
that wish they were in your position it

218
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:17,330
can build what you've built for yourself

219
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:19,640
like what how did you do that like what

220
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:22,280
kind of mentality do you need to have or

221
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:25,910
work ethic to build a career off dancing

222
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:34,659
of all things uh it's a real question

223
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:34,659
isn't it yep I have low expectations

224
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:43,580
like I think I grew up at such like a

225
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:45,260
bot like a I got a low standard as far

226
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,700
as like quality of life I don't know

227
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,230
everybody's perspective is different but

228
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:51,589
like I grew up not really having

229
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:53,550
anything and the idea of like like a job

230
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:55,890
of like a dream job at that time

231
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:57,450
probably something like a claims

232
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:59,399
adjuster or something something that

233
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,630
like is equal to like what my families

234
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:02,760
are doing just we grew up in a low

235
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:05,190
standard so I felt like because of that

236
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:08,310
if I just keep like trying to surpass

237
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:10,860
that then who knows what can happen so

238
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,149
it's almost like I'm kind of climbing

239
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,290
this ladder of like what the is

240
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:15,149
happening with my life and I'm just

241
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:17,820
still going just because I didn't expect

242
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:19,560
to get this when you say sorry sorry to

243
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,380
interrupt you but when you say low

244
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,000
standard what is it that you didn't grow

245
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:28,500
up with money or you just didn't have

246
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,240
standards so the truth comes out all

247
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,070
right David you just just trying to get

248
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,050
into the trunk dig deeper Gashi alright

249
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:38,010
so I was born in Sacramento California

250
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:41,399
alright and my mom grew up in my mom at

251
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:46,370
the time was on welfare well thanks Dave

252
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,370
and she was like you know paper Subway's

253
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:52,290
characters I never established this bond

254
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:59,250
feeling the Holy Spirit so let me speak

255
00:09:52,290 --> 00:10:00,810
mofo go so anyway so anyway I think like

256
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,880
to be honest yeah my mom did grow up

257
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:06,120
like we just grew up strict on funds and

258
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,980
I was just like the we just didn't have

259
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,940
a lot and I just felt like dance was one

260
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,570
of the one things that I think any

261
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:14,430
especially a b-boy at that time like we

262
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,380
just got all types of hate from you know

263
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:18,450
everything cuz there was no literally

264
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,579
like overall way to make money off of

265
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,230
breaking and then they came off the show

266
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:24,660
called So You Think and danced in 2005

267
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:27,060
and then like literally just taking that

268
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,010
opportunity and essentially just always

269
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,390
showing up to opportunities even if I

270
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:33,000
felt like I wasn't ready I think was the

271
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:37,380
one thing that helped develop everything

272
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,089
I have you know that and Ryan Higa see

273
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:42,149
that I mean I do remember telling you to

274
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:43,560
do YouTube and the reason was because of

275
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:45,360
your personality it wasn't I mean like

276
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,459
obviously people there's dancers right

277
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,600
and dancers I mean you know the biggest

278
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:51,690
you can get to a certain degree without

279
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:54,329
having you know branding behind it is

280
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,800
like a backup dancer to like a really

281
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:58,290
famous Justin Bieber or somebody right

282
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,029
well I don't know I may be teaching but

283
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,949
you kind of went with that route you

284
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:04,140
went with your success with dancing but

285
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:06,180
you used it to create Dietrich's the

286
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,080
personality you know I mean and I think

287
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,340
that

288
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,890
isn't that what you were trying to teach

289
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,870
with your passionate project mmm

290
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:15,420
passionate yeah cuz it's more than just

291
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:18,900
okay become a great dancer right yeah I

292
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:21,300
think it's like overall what is the

293
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:23,760
question like I mean I think is it is it

294
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:26,130
just what was it was more of a question

295
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,660
it was more of a statement of like why

296
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,740
you are where you are is because you

297
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,260
didn't just follow the road of just

298
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,390
becoming a great dancer and then you

299
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,550
know teaching or becoming a backup

300
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,720
dancer like you you

301
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,370
the reason why they picked you up is

302
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,650
because you built your personality yeah

303
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:42,630
and I think overall it's like a big part

304
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:44,520
of it was growth I think I think I've

305
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,780
always been obsessed with this is like a

306
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,730
really answer but like since the very

307
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,290
beginning and to go to also answer you

308
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,390
Ryan your statement which wasn't a

309
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:53,040
question but to kind of go back to just

310
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:54,660
answer both those things is I was

311
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,490
obsessed with growth of like learning

312
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:59,130
about whatever I was doing or if I

313
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:01,350
started something new the growth of that

314
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,970
and then what that just became I guess

315
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:04,980
the more you grow you just are able to

316
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:09,150
offer more stuff to this world and then

317
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:13,110
if you're decent enough people just pay

318
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:15,750
you to do that's kind of the goal

319
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:17,850
yeah is it fair to say that you are

320
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,950
obsessed with becoming better at

321
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,180
whatever you try to do oh hell yeah just

322
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:23,490
because I thought I constantly think I

323
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:25,290
suck and I feel like it's just uh that's

324
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:28,110
part of anyway like I think any creative

325
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:29,190
they just you know always I just feel

326
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,780
like I'm just obsessed with knowledge

327
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:32,340
knife like I just need to keep getting

328
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,320
better and you feel like that you did

329
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:37,080
that with dance - I'm still doing it

330
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,150
with that look at all these young cuz

331
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,280
there's so many young kids online is my

332
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:43,560
father killing like these little

333
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,700
eight-year-old kids right I know when

334
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,330
you see them what do you what do you

335
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:52,830
feel um

336
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:54,630
feelings for natal when you see these no

337
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,400
okay so like what do you how do you

338
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,930
react so I I work with a lot of these

339
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,100
younger kids too especially like the

340
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:02,130
ones that are moving out of here because

341
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,660
they're so dope on I I feel like the

342
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:05,010
beautiful thing about them is that they

343
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,140
haven't gone through enough life stuff

344
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,700
to realize the restrictions and fears

345
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:11,280
that life can teaches you to be afraid

346
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,560
to fail you know I'm saying so they're

347
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,750
gonna learn how to they're gonna start

348
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,450
something see the standard at an early

349
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,500
age and then just go after that and then

350
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:21,450
I

351
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,310
for me it's inspiring I feel like it's

352
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,930
like it's really really dope to see

353
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,870
these kids picking up stuff and being

354
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:31,020
freaking masters at it hella hella early

355
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:32,870
[ __ ] and then and then you feel like

356
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:34,670
you need to become better than them no

357
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:37,680
where are you go

358
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:40,440
no because we were talking about how you

359
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:44,280
are obsessed with growth and when you

360
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:46,410
see young kids who are surpassing your

361
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,880
skill sets or whatever yeah you wish you

362
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,470
had when you were that age not only they

363
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:54,510
surpass their skill sets over here David

364
00:13:49,470 --> 00:14:00,510
I still get I still get down so get down

365
00:13:54,510 --> 00:14:01,860
in my day when I watch you dad you're a

366
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:04,050
master you're a master of your craft

367
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:07,350
there's not a lot of people in this

368
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:09,830
world who can move like you that sounds

369
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:13,140
weird but like we do a replay of this

370
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:14,910
we're talking and and like I'm just

371
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:17,220
wondering from you know your perspective

372
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:19,830
as a master of your craft doing it for

373
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:23,190
like over a decade and have you know

374
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:24,780
your judge on shows like when you see it

375
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:26,730
like do you feel like a little bit of

376
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,290
competitiveness with these young kids

377
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,330
like not that you're gonna directly

378
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:31,860
compete with them but you know like for

379
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:33,900
me example as a musician when I see

380
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,700
these young kids I'm like damn I wish I

381
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:41,340
was as good as them I still feel that

382
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:44,130
now you want to talk about it I guess

383
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:45,900
for me not really just because uh for me

384
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:47,370
I get excited about the the future of

385
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,140
the generation if anything I always like

386
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,970
to help out on the the that the

387
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,160
dancers don't know about like how to

388
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:55,380
monetize it on how to create a life

389
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,540
longevity lifestyle of it or if you're a

390
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:59,070
young kid a big part of it is you have

391
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:02,880
all the movement and I'm pop I know you

392
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:04,140
can vouch for this - is these kids

393
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,930
haven't gone through enough like life

394
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:09,600
emotional to like really understand

395
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:10,950
why you're dancing yet does that meaning

396
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,840
to the motion because you got to go

397
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:15,720
through some crazy to be able to

398
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,970
like express dance in a way that people

399
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,940
can translate it that don't understand

400
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:22,530
dance right so for me with dances I

401
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,600
always try to make dance secondary to

402
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:27,360
whatever I'm doing meaning like what is

403
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,500
the message I'm trying to to say or what

404
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,820
is it that I can get the average person

405
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,610
at home that doesn't care about Dan's to

406
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,320
want to watch that or showcase that to

407
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:35,300
other people I don't

408
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,640
about dance so with these young dancers

409
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:40,880
it's like they have all the amazing

410
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:42,950
facilities and they'll destroy me at my

411
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,110
craft physically but when it comes to

412
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,910
emotion and be able to tell story that's

413
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,140
what I would love to help out for them

414
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,970
because I feel like if I was that age

415
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:52,400
and someone help me with that it should

416
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:54,410
be like you're able to like almost get

417
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:57,170
it even faster does that make sense so

418
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:59,390
it's like the why but so how do you

419
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:00,530
teach like you said they don't have the

420
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,630
experience how you teach someone like

421
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:04,640
that well what do you do would he tell

422
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:06,860
them well I I said it was about like

423
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,900
experiencing emotional you gotta hurt

424
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:11,330
yeah yeah I just I beat the out of

425
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,860
them you spoke to both my ninja milk oh

426
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:17,990
my god

427
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:20,390
emotionally ruining the moment oh my god

428
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:22,580
there's so many cheap references no

429
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:24,260
one's gonna get but what I'm saying is I

430
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:30,230
could kind of relate because in music

431
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:32,390
you know Dave's trying to speak [ __ ]

432
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,530
go for it go like you could tell if

433
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,990
someone's singing from a place of

434
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:40,580
experience versus something that they

435
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:52,100
just are just singing for example for

436
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:53,840
example you say to me you made that song

437
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,670
up right that's original

438
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,110
yeah so you guys if you guys want to

439
00:16:55,670 --> 00:17:01,040
play that you're gonna have to pay me

440
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:02,500
royalties royalties well I mean really

441
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:07,209
nice attitude

442
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:10,130
this is B you know this speaks to you're

443
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:11,689
funded really interesting your person is

444
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,430
it your personality type though and I

445
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:15,829
and I think I've told you about this too

446
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:17,959
is like and I think this is also what

447
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:19,400
makes you great is that you you do

448
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:20,810
always want to get better and that's why

449
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,070
you got really good at dance and then

450
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:23,839
you find something else that you really

451
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:25,790
want to be good at like singing like you

452
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,350
were trying to take you're never really

453
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,730
sang before but you've been taking like

454
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:35,810
classes for like eight months right oh

455
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:37,640
yeah yes yes yes I mean with everything

456
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:39,980
you do if you get into something you get

457
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,320
obsessed I get obsessed for example like

458
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:45,210
our friendship right mmm I'm obsessed

459
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:48,560
with bringing back what we had

460
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:52,860
you know I feel like Ryan I feel like

461
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:56,400
since the ytf days you know it wasn't it

462
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:59,160
wasn't it wasn't you know it was you

463
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,200
know but I feel like I want like our

464
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:04,260
planet it was turning into a beautiful

465
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:08,310
tree in the forest of great friendships

466
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:10,560
and I feel like we was blossoming and

467
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:13,110
then like if you were the water and I

468
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:16,080
was the Sun it's like I want to be a

469
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:19,500
better son for your water and I feel

470
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:22,110
like we can build our tree a friendship

471
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,430
again so with that being said I study a

472
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:27,750
lot about friendships and stuff and

473
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:28,560
wanting to grow those things and Dom

474
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,930
doesn't drink

475
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,430
he's never drank before in his life he

476
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:40,950
doesn't do drugs he's very clean have

477
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:44,970
you ever done drugs before Ryan

478
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:47,400
introduced me to adderall so yeah yeah

479
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,840
so you just brought up ytf very quickly

480
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:53,190
there's no punch to that phrase I'm

481
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:54,150
sorry what what did you have fun at ytf

482
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:57,270
like can you tell us about your

483
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:59,250
experiences I had a blast ytf I think we

484
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:04,170
all did it in some certain point it just

485
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:04,800
ended kind of funky you know that I

486
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,960
don't know

487
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:10,500
no I thought why can't was great I think

488
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,090
it was like we had an awesome run and it

489
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,310
was like the first of its kind and again

490
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:17,190
I got a praise Ryan because essentially

491
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:20,130
Ryan put his brand his own personal

492
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:21,540
brand aside for six friends I'm pretty

493
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:23,370
sure I like everybody did but I think

494
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:25,200
everybody did everybody did to an extent

495
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:27,690
but the Ryan was like the the one that

496
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,560
like literally birthed a lot of our Kurt

497
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,980
our pushes and careers on YouTube and

498
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,530
thanks man

499
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:36,480
well I mean keV already had a career you

500
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:38,460

501
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,830
it helped everyone including myself yeah

502
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,360
like that was like that was like what

503
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,610
are they called team ten before that

504
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,560
existed right I mean we didn't do that

505
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:48,000
we had I thought people like did that

506
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,410
though to a certain degree like we lived

507
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,080
in the same building the haunted

508
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:53,520
building where everybody lives now in

509
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,660
North Hollywood you thought I'm sorry I

510
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,110
never thought it was there's a couple

511
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,610
weird things dude there's weird

512
00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:00,870
in that building people who live there

513
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:04,320
or room you heard other stories I mean

514
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:06,460
our room and then Kevin Victor's room

515
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:10,960
why didn't Kevin Victor were haunting

516
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:12,010
there oh well there's there's there's a

517
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,470
lot of people living there now but

518
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,580
anyway we kind of did that there's

519
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:17,320
certain degree I don't think there was

520
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:20,679
other groups before us no it would be

521
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:22,480
cool I thought it was dope yeah yeah I

522
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:23,650
thought it was the idea was there would

523
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,299
you guys ever bring it back

524
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:28,240

525
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:29,980
been down uh right I don't even know

526
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,790
what that means like oh why every means

527
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:35,860
yesterday today forever I mean like just

528
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:37,960
like what like touring I don't want to I

529
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:40,090
don't want a tour what if we made a show

530
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,890
we could do a show I could do one you

531
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:45,070
don't have to do it but what if we made

532
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:46,750
a show oh yeah was that the original

533
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,220
[ __ ] season why we've made whites yeah

534
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,450
yeah the whole goal was to that we

535
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,500
didn't have to do it later

536
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:52,270
like we don't have to keep doing these

537
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:55,120
shows cuz we're gonna get old eventually

538
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:58,480
yeah we didn't really do that we didn't

539
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,250
follow through so that was why Tia did

540
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,140
you guys what did you watch ytf Parker

550
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:36,280
challenge but Dom you have an Emmy you

00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:39,280
want an Emmy like you're you're one of

552
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:41,470
the very few you just won an Emmy Award

553
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,390
it's kind of like any award they kind of

554
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:45,640
just sit there and develop dust okay but

555
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:47,380
did you ever dream of even winning one

556
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:51,150
of these like did you actually see

557
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:55,270
yourself no no definitely not so yeah

558
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:58,809
that was in 2016 that yeah question won

559
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:59,890
an Emmy in hail no like I've I don't

560
00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:02,110
even think that we thought that was

561
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:04,750
possible when we were doing that show to

562
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:06,520
be completely honest so no I never

563
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:09,309
thought that that's crazy

564
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:11,860
where is it what do you do do you like

565
00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:13,299
collecting yes yeah I don't know like I

566
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,740
don't know you guys feel about awards

567
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:15,789
but I feel like awards are like the one

568
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:19,330
thing that it's like it doesn't matter

569
00:22:15,789 --> 00:22:21,210
how like basic or how amazing it is they

570
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:24,100
all kind of do the same thing and click

571
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:26,620
dust I mean I maybe I was able to charge

572
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:28,389
a little bit more for teaching but I

573
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,919
don't know yeah it's just a resume thing

574
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:31,749
right I guess that's the incredibly

575
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:35,200
that's a real award yeah that's not like

576
00:22:31,749 --> 00:22:36,490
you're getting like some randoms like oh

577
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,110
we feel bad for the Asians and the

578
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,850
Oscars that up so let's give these

579
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:41,980
Asians dudes and award yeah but it's

580
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,119
still like people still think it's that

581
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,950
it's still connected

582
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:47,019
it's an Emmy you know you're right I'm

583
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:49,389
so much better than you guys you are in

584
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:52,330
that respect for sure do people know

585
00:22:49,389 --> 00:22:56,799
you're Asian you're happy people know

586
00:22:52,330 --> 00:23:00,249
your fans know oh you know right yeah I

587
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:04,509
think so you're half Filipino 68.7% - oh

588
00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:05,740
you took a test yeah and uh the one

589
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:09,879
where I did my own math and looking at

590
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:14,999
my family um so uh yeah but I think it's

591
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:19,299
about that but the rest is uh etiqa

592
00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:22,749
Etica is Ryan's jokes can you tell us

593
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:26,230
more about passionnate yeah so I started

594
00:23:22,749 --> 00:23:31,470
a company called passion 8 is that a

595
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:34,389
play on passionate oh my good

596
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:35,679
you're pretty yeah it is thank you

597
00:23:34,389 --> 00:23:38,019
you're the first one ever point that out

598
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,940
but I didn't I was just wondering no

599
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:42,730
because it might not have been yeah

600
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:44,769
passionate is basically uh passionate I

601
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:46,210
created a company to essentially help

602
00:23:44,769 --> 00:23:47,860
the next generation of dancers or any

603
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:50,139
dancers that feel like they want to get

604
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:53,759
like the level up of their careers not

605
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:55,960
just like physically but mentally so

606
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:58,029
they can have the same type of outcome

607
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,169
that I feel like I was lucky and

608
00:23:58,029 --> 00:24:02,590
grateful enough to have that I didn't

609
00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:07,539
expect I was gonna have so yeah get

610
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:09,610
passionate calm slash that's it I think

611
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:10,840
it's the passion is calm just a slash

612
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:12,249
I'm gonna talk about some of the recent

613
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,419
projects that you did cuz you're working

614
00:24:12,249 --> 00:24:15,249
with is it Logan

615
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:17,409
Oh bigger logistics we should roll clip

616
00:24:15,249 --> 00:24:21,730
of that right now I don't and we're

617
00:24:17,409 --> 00:24:23,890
barraged no let's use my video

618
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:25,090
right okay even then it's like someone

619
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:27,250
okay who is this person

620
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:28,450
oh dude who is this person oh my god you

621
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,530
know really I don't know so you know

622
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:31,300
you're talking about earlier this kid

623
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:33,790
that like changing the game and dance

624
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:35,740
like so she's like literally to me she's

625
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:37,480
well she's 16 now but I've noticed and

626
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:40,840
she was started probably like nine or

627
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:42,520
something but we did this show called

628
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,970
roller roller dance season to last

629
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:47,440
season and she was on the team that that

630
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:49,330
I was able to choreograph that one and

631
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,860
her name is Logan she was on the lab and

632
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:53,230
I was a girl

633
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:54,700
yeah Logan's a girl B girl logistics is

634
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:57,040
there be a people name and she's like

635
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:59,050
completely blown up like crazy over this

636
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:02,500
last year not just like industry wise

637
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:05,410
but asked like like B girl wise and like

638
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:07,600
all styles dance wise but what was your

639
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:08,980
question Paco was just like what you've

640
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,390
been doing with project late because I

641
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,740
know that you guys just did a video

642
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:15,880
together right yeah we just did a video

643
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:17,440
who you are by oh that was her oh yeah

644
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,660
that what you see it yeah oh yeah you

645
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,880
commented yeah thanks dude yeah thank

646
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:24,520
you uh again a big part of it was

647
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:28,030
because it was her and I wrote the idea

648
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:29,080
down and I pitched it to her and I was

649
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:30,940
like this is not gonna happen unless

650
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,650
it's you because when I was creating I

651
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:35,260
just kept picturing her and she was down

652
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:37,300
to trust me that piece and boom I for me

653
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:39,070
I think it's the best piece I've ever we

654
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,810
I've ever got to create up and to date

655
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,730
and again odd to say big part of it

656
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:44,950
because she is so amazing if you haven't

657
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:46,600
seen it then you can go check it out

658
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:48,610
I know that was meaningful to you

659
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,250
because you're the one who introduced me

660
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:52,960
to Jessie J right oh really that song

661
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:55,390
yeah that's that specifically that song

662
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,390
before she became Jessie J the the pop

663
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:59,740
artist she was yeah see - yeah we used

664
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,150
to listen to that same song it was a

665
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,620
youtube video it wasn't even like she's

666
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:04,480
on stage it wasn't even like a produce

667
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:06,250
thing and she was seeing who you are and

668
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,110
like you would listen to that over and

669
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:10,210
over and over to the point that I like

670
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:11,770
memorized it right so I knew that if

671
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:13,720
you're gonna be something good you're

672
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:15,610
gonna what you memorize the song good

673
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,430
well I mean I memorize about knowing do

674
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:27,100
it anything I would rather be the part

675
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:28,420
where she yells out big okay anyway we

676
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,670
were watching I knew it meant a lot to

677
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,840
you because you never really did well

678
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:34,960
you've done some stuff to it but you

679
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,590
never really had the fact that you were

680
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,809
gonna showcase

681
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:39,549
song it had to have meant a lot to you

682
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:41,919
yeah how you felt about it

683
00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:44,320
yeah it's a beautiful song and the piece

684
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,730
was about I think like young girls that

685
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,900
struggle with what to post on Instagram

686
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,490
if like people do this all the time in

687
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,900
general not just young girls but I feel

688
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:53,679
like young girls that I have heard about

689
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:55,240
especially from her like in the lab like

690
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,159
that's big that people struggle with was

691
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:01,799
like as a young girl like what do I

692
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:06,669
produce that will maintain my like

693
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:08,200
self-love and like putting that at risk

694
00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:10,570
for the idea of getting more likes for

695
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,610
more followers so I felt like if I was

696
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:14,830
able to tell a story that can help them

697
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:17,890
with that I'll be able to change lives

698
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:19,210
and Logan made it came to life so yeah

699
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,260
and I thought it'd be weird cuz I've

700
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:24,429
always want to do that piece but I feel

701
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:25,809
like if I play the young girl it would

702
00:27:24,429 --> 00:27:27,940
be better and wouldn't wouldn't take

703
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:33,700
away from the song yeah and Trixie was

704
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:35,140
she was booked yeah okay well well

705
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,330
that's your girl character yeah I don't

706
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:39,250
know yeah so you you're kind of on

707
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:41,440
hiatus right from posting YouTube videos

708
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:42,880
yeah obviously you're doing a lot of

709
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,010
other things passionnate and then you're

710
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,559
judging so you think indents often do

711
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:49,149
you shoot once a week

712
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:52,179
Oh once a week once a week so it's not

713
00:27:49,149 --> 00:27:55,980
that I doing in between those being lazy

714
00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:58,299
no you're not lazy uh working on music

715
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:02,169
okay so you're doing stuff yeah but it's

716
00:27:58,299 --> 00:28:05,169
just taking forever what does that mean

717
00:28:02,169 --> 00:28:07,360
like suck it seems no I've been

718
00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:10,480

719
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,039
year now mm-hmm and because I I've

720
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,049
always wanted to a musical like a film

721
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:16,570
musicals that to you before so I figured

722
00:28:14,049 --> 00:28:18,159
I'd learn how to at least do basic

723
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,149
so I can write it for not even me for

724
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,419
other people mhm

725
00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:24,130
but that's like a longevity dream you've

726
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:26,200
been taking lessons too vocal vocal

727
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:27,850
lessons right yeah cuz I went to uh this

728
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,320
guy I'm David Choi once and I was like

729
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:32,230
yo David can't remember singing he's

730
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:34,149
like I don't do that I play piano I was

731
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:36,909

732
00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:38,919
oh I know you did go to him though yeah

733
00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:41,110
one point oh yeah

734
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:42,730
well we're actually supposed to work on

735
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,870
more stuff together but that was again

736
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:46,210
my fault I'm not ready yet

737
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:50,070
David I want to be at your standard I'm

738
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:50,070
ready for you whenever you're ready

739
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:56,950
I'm ready now I was waiting for the

740
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:59,409
punch timing right downtime hard time

741
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:03,429
all right so you're working to music

742
00:28:59,409 --> 00:29:04,809
yeah you're working on well obviously

743
00:29:03,429 --> 00:29:06,730
you're doing the show you're doing are

744
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:08,980
you still doing passion 8 yeah we're

745
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:10,510
doing a next summer we'll end up being

746
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:14,200
the next one we do okay we're gonna like

747
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:15,399
pry something on clinic then a clinic I

748
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,899
just thought of like a meeting or

749
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:18,730
something oh no I mean like a bath you

750
00:29:16,899 --> 00:29:20,620
know basketball clinic you like going oh

751
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:22,299
yeah yeah for like a week and then do

752
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:25,029
something in yeah it's just uh it's like

753
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:27,730
a weekend long thing and I think we're

754
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:31,779
gonna happen yeah yeah it's kind of cold

755
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:33,580
mmm cuz my day 3 everybody's weird yeah

756
00:29:31,779 --> 00:29:35,890
it's a good way to turn people off

757
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:37,809
though I'm gonna go in there no but I

758
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:40,000
kind of like it takes a while to find

759
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:41,260
the right people that come and take the

760
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,149
experience too because a big part of it

761
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,620
is just like not just feel submitting

762
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:46,720
but it's like having the right people

763
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:49,149
that really want that because it's like

764
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,190
we go and really deep as far as like the

765
00:29:49,149 --> 00:29:53,350
dance ability itself the psychology the

766
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:55,779
business aspect of it and I think it's

767
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:57,760
just it's it's for everybody essentially

768
00:29:55,779 --> 00:29:59,200
ever all types of dancers like any but

769
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,029
more importantly like if people really

770
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,250
want to live off this craft and I think

771
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:06,279
this is probably the best live off the

772
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:08,649
craft of dances the best uh I guess

773
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:11,710
clinic you can like you could take to

774
00:30:08,649 --> 00:30:14,080
really have that outcome now and what

775
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:17,110
better place then to learn from a master

776
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:19,210
who's pioneered his own career you're so

777
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:20,799
sweet thank you man I guess you think

778
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:23,020
that of me but I I don't really think

779
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:25,570
that I'm still learning it's it's a fact

780
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:27,010
um always learning though oh yeah right

781
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,720
that's kind of it like I mean gets to be

782
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:29,799
a pioneer like you've mastered music but

783
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:35,799
you're still learning about it right

784
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:37,750
he's like no like God for a while yeah

785
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:40,690
it's those are true words of a master

786
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:43,360
Ryan you've mastered the art of comedy

787
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:44,590
and YouTube videos no I haven't really

788
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,659
yes really

789
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:50,169
so there's the rest of us all say that

790
00:30:46,659 --> 00:30:53,529
maybe 2005 to 2010 YouTube comedy

791
00:30:50,169 --> 00:30:55,120
specifically mm maybe I mastered that

792
00:30:53,529 --> 00:31:00,909
you've also mastered the art of being

793
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:02,770
humble that is an art well you know what

what if that is someone's real it

820
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:22,690
definitely is why they might be one of

821
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:30,910
the first people ever like Jesus's

822
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:33,790
cousin so we recently had Bethenny on

823
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:36,100
the podcast mota bethany mota you know

824
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:39,640

825
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:41,320
yes she is a thirties she what she said

826
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,000
I didn't watch them so as a Storify you

827
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:45,270
guys met she's definitely yeah - because

828
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,150
I didn't know she she's my better 2/3

829
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:52,210
but so obviously because Beth is you

830
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:55,150
know famous in her own right a lot of

831
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:56,830
the questions are about Beth oh come and

832
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:58,360
because obviously the other episode -

833
00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:00,820
right we talked about you as well

834
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,260
a lot of number remember what you

835
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:05,470
made for her on her birthday

836
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:07,660
of course you'd remember oh yeah

837
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:08,620
the bedroom yeah the childhood room

838
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:12,460
that's creepy

839
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:14,320
it is now that we say it like this like

840
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,720
if I were to show you guys the room it

841
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,990
wouldn't be

842
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:20,710
as creepy there was a thoughtful idea

843
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:23,720
okay there's a reason for that

844
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:25,360
this is your chance to explain your side

845
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,770
because we feel like in our relationship

846
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,290
where our best selves when we're coming

847
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:32,510
from a place of playing and like having

848
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:34,640
like a fearless type of like attitude

849
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:37,010
and state and we feel like that those

850
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,630
times were always when we were kids so

851
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:41,350
we always try to maintain like a

852
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:44,810
childish like playful type of

853
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:46,880
relationship so I decided to make her

854
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:48,680
childhood room so if she ever felt like

855
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,390
she needed to relive it or you know be

856
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,910
in that state or if is that time of the

857
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:55,550
month she can go inside the room she can

858
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:57,800
go inside Rule three she can go inside

859
00:33:55,550 --> 00:34:04,090
of her room and just like okay I

860
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:06,380
remember what it was like my friend I

861
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:08,210
mean it was a good the thought was there

862
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:09,920
right yeah and I actually I'm very proud

863
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:12,590
of him I'm very proud of the guy still

864
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:14,270
there yeah yeah it's at your house yeah

865
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:16,640
it's at my place I just took one of the

866
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:21,380
rooms and made her her room and she she

867
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:24,440
still uses it for storage but it's I

868
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:26,210
yeah its storage it's actually like well

869
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:28,310
thought out though like when you showed

870
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:29,840
us to that room it was like wow there's

871
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:31,850
a lot of thought put into this you did a

872
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:35,210
lot of research watch I you saw it yeah

873
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:37,250
that's how I found out yeah oh yeah it's

874
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:42,200
really quick it took me a while it's

875
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:44,590
cool it was cool you had to like uh you

876
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,760
have to look for a tv/vcr

877
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:48,230
two-in-one right they used to have that

878
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,480
by the way for you guys watching this

879
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:53,240
not knowing these have TVs adviye

880
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,970
like a v8 like a VHS player mm-hmm a VCR

881
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:58,130
and a DVD player and I had a fight and

882
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:59,360
it took forever and I was like the one

883
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:01,820
thing I was like this is gonna be hard

884
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,830
to get mm-hmm but yeah we found it

885
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:06,860
Facebook marketplace do you guys ever

886
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:08,450
argue about little things about like do

887
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:10,640
you guys ever argue or is it just yeah

888
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:12,590

889
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,970
Christ no I mean but you guys have

890
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:16,580
probably still argue what do you guys

891
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:18,410
disagree about like um well you know

892
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,940
it's like a common one and maybe she'll

893
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,140
say something else but if I could common

894
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,810
thing we disagree about is how we're not

895
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:25,670
enough for the other person like you're

896
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:27,350
your own self yeah like we feel like oh

897
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:28,640
wow we argue over the idea that I'm not

898
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:30,530
for her and then she argues over the day

899
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,630
she's not enough for me we always want

900
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:35,540
to be better for that person so as more

901
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:38,900
like an internal argument that's out

902
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:41,650
ternal it's almost healthy don't shoot I

903
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:44,840
mean it's better to have that that yeah

904
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:45,530
right oh yeah placing blame and like and

905
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,680
I can do better

906
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:50,240
oh yeah yeah I used to place babe babe

907
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:53,120
babe

908
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,860
hashtag no well I used to place blame a

909
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:57,020
lot but I feel like that's why my past

910
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:59,230
relationships didn't work out you know

911
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:01,700
speaking of which Ryan I feel like I

912
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:03,170
feel like we came to a place in our

913
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,810
relationship where I was blaming you a

914
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:09,110
lot for the paint and I realized it was

915
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:11,300
really just inside of me and I just want

916
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:13,850
to say I'm so sorry callbacks write that

917
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:16,040
down I call back but whether or not it

918
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:20,030
stays in the video it's up to you but

919
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:21,140
just call back writing anything um but

920
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:22,910
yeah I think it's healthy to argue in

921
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:24,710
any relationship I think it's like it's

922
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:26,990
gonna happen but I think more

923
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:28,760
importantly to know how it goes after

924
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:30,890
that and if you guys can grow from it is

925
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:33,410
where the importance is do you guys hang

926
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:37,180
out a lot yes every every day or every

927
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:41,330
day yeah are both busy people so yeah

928
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:43,070
we're busy like singing and like but

929
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:45,200
she's good I don't think is it because I

930
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:47,120
heard her sing yeah it's beautiful right

931
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,430
it's just really good she's super good

932
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:51,500
yeah uh and then she'll be like I'm not

933
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:55,130
good not like and then you think like oh

934
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:58,190
 I suck I hurt you I'm really yeah

935
00:36:55,130 --> 00:37:00,170
so I'm like damn I must really suck cuz

936
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:01,490
you don't think what did she say what

937
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:03,080
did she think about or what'd she say to

938
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:06,950
you about your singing she usually does

939
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:11,180
this and I think that means you she

940
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:12,950
likes it makes a face no like I think

941
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:16,340
she's very supportive but I'm like I

942
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:18,500
mean I'm still new to it right mhm but I

943
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:20,720
I think she's very supportive overall

944
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,460
just to listen to it all day it's

945
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,050
probably really annoying for it's like I

946
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:31,850
imagine if she was just practicing her

947
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:34,280
dancing she's like babe like oh you

948
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:36,470
be supportive wait hold on so as a

949
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,850
dancer when someone's practicing in

950
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:39,020
front of you and they're not very good

951
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:40,850
does that annoy you

952
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:43,040
no oh I

953
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:46,640
actually the thing with me is like I

954
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,660
want to help the person I get better but

955
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,460
I think that's what the problem is like

956
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:54,140
we're singing I like I want her to help

957
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:57,140
me but she doesn't would you like her to

958
00:37:54,140 --> 00:38:00,530
I will babe how many learn how to sing

959
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:02,780
better did you ever ask her did help you

960
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:06,190
yeah oh yeah

961
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,190
and what she usually say then

962
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:25,480
[Music]

963
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:27,440
I can do that I'd like my ATD is bad uh

964
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:30,170
where did that go

965
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:33,380
I usually ask her to help me but I think

966
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:35,089
she's like always like she probably

967
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,020
started of hearing me she honestly just

968
00:38:35,089 --> 00:38:37,700
feels like she's not good enough to help

969
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:40,700
me to be honest really yeah we

970
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:43,010
completely honest but I can listen to

971
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:45,680
her I got to get better what do you like

972
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:47,510
most about her I'm sure there are a lot

973
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,240
of things but yeah I was deep things

974
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:52,700
right away but I authentically move she

975
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,619
like inside her moral value I think I

976
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,569
was it brought me to her initially to is

977
00:38:54,619 --> 00:38:58,730
like this her to amount of self-love

978
00:38:56,569 --> 00:39:00,740
that she had for herself I felt like oh

979
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:03,950
man that's cool that's like that's like

980
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:07,789
a really cliche in deep but um I love

981
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:10,880
the fact that she yeah I just turns me

982
00:39:07,789 --> 00:39:12,529
on that she that she's confident in

983
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,640
herself yeah yeah she has like not in a

984
00:39:12,529 --> 00:39:15,200
boastful way but she just sounds like

985
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,809
this like she wants to be a better

986
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,369
person constantly and I felt like with

987
00:39:17,809 --> 00:39:21,410
my past relationships I've liked in

988
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:22,819
relationships in general in order to be

989
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:24,559
best for that person you can't gotta be

990
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:27,380
your best self I almost like it to be

991
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:29,589
selfish to be selfless type of thing so

992
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:34,640
that yeah I think I think that

993
00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:36,740
and she's bomb you see her oh look at

994
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:44,150
your boy get another the young the young

995
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:46,160
but thank you baby it's great no I I

996
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:48,410
mean you obviously really really love

997
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,180
her and and when she was talking about

998
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:53,240
you really loves you

999
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:53,839
I see you guys is a great beautiful

1000
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,200
couple

1001
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:58,789
oh wow thanks I guess a question that I

1002
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:02,089
have since you know you came up from

1003
00:39:58,789 --> 00:40:05,839
hard times and and at where you are now

1004
00:40:02,089 --> 00:40:08,390
maybe you can give advice to you know

1005
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:09,920
your past self or even like other kids

1006
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:12,500
who are in this area that aren't maybe

1007
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,700
able to get into passionate and they

1008
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,770
just you know they're looking for like

1009
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:19,700
advice from somebody who's made it out

1010
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:22,460
of hard times oh yeah my past self I'd

1011
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:28,359
probably say continue

1012
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:31,550
a little bit of gingivitis

1013
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:38,420
self-deprecation write that down don't

1014
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:39,710
touch my paper yeah and I think to the

1015
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,940
just the person out there that feels

1016
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:43,790
like it's kind of like really really

1017
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:45,200
tough which I believe it's it's tough

1018
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:48,470
for everybody is just different types of

1019
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,540
how tough is I think the ability to play

1020
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:53,900
and look at everything as an opportunity

1021
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:57,410
instead of an obligation really helps a

1022
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:59,210
lot I think with that growth and if you

1023
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:01,970
become obsessive about something like a

1024
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:04,040
craft and it takes you away from like

1025
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:06,250
whatever pain could be I keep investing

1026
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:08,720
in that and then also be okay with a

1027
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:11,480
pain you know because I fly gets the key

1028
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:14,750
ingredient to be able to to heal it to

1029
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:16,940
be to be honest so I feel like if I had

1030
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:26,240
background music it would help a lot

1031
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:28,940
more sorry this is all we have hey y'all

1032
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,830
these guys are down well I'm here to let

1033
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:32,420
you guys know that the only great thing

1034
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:34,460
about down is that you know what up is

1035
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:36,109
alright because without down there is no

1036
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,820
up its life was just always about up

1037
00:41:36,109 --> 00:41:41,060
there never be down and you would never

1038
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:42,530
understand that up it's just it's just

1039
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:44,839
up there you have nothing to judge it on

1040
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:46,910
so you got to thank the Downs especially

1041
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:56,050
if you're thanking us now make sure your

1042
00:41:46,910 --> 00:42:00,020
thumbs up this video characters you you

1043
00:41:56,050 --> 00:42:02,119
believe they're like losing is important

1044
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:04,250
oh hell yeah for me at least I don't

1045
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:05,450
know I mean I'm all you guys have done

1046
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:07,970
great things in your life in your

1047
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:10,820
careers for me I've been I thought the

1048
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:12,859
one thing that's made my whole life

1049
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:16,609
possible is the idea of losing and

1050
00:42:12,859 --> 00:42:18,619
failing so without it again I don't

1051
00:42:16,609 --> 00:42:21,020
think you would really understand what

1052
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:23,089
the other side is it's kind of like

1053
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:25,040
heaven right they describe heaven as

1054
00:42:23,089 --> 00:42:26,330
this place of like perfection and then

1055
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,460
you really think about perfect and if

1056
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:29,690
this this world was perfect how would

1057
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:32,150
you know what it is without having the

1058
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:33,859
opposite right so there's like a beauty

1059
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:35,720
to the not being perfect cuz everything

1060
00:42:33,859 --> 00:42:36,140
was perfect then inhale it be perfectly

1061
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,610
dark

1062
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:40,010
so then he's like oh I don't know how to

1063
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:41,240
judge it so I'm just there right so it's

1064
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:42,740
kind of like that I just look at

1065
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,320
everything is like oh the beauty behind

1066
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:47,510
the up is or one thing is the opposite

1067
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,700
of it because you would never know what

1068
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:52,370
that is

1069
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:52,970
deep hashtag deep do you believe there

1070
00:42:52,370 --> 00:43:02,590
is a heaven

1071
00:42:52,970 --> 00:43:07,070
I believe this is heaven especially

1072
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:11,540
sitting with three angels that's right

1073
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:12,050
even you Paco or an angel write that

1074
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:21,290
down

1075
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:22,070
[ __ ] I'm sorry no it'll be good

1076
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:23,630
awesome

1077
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:27,650
you're giving him a mall right now use

1078
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:29,210
all of it yeah you want to get into

1079
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:30,350
these already this is like weird for me

1080
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:35,120
because I usually want to ask like you

1081
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:37,190
guys questions go for it's Karma do you

1082
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:39,110
guys think there's a heaven do you think

1083
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:43,820
there's a heaven David I believe there's

1084
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:46,340
a heaven yeah yeah I believe in some I

1085
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:47,000
mean form of it I believe in the

1086
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:50,180
afterlife

1087
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,890
oh yeah I do too I do too I agree you

1088
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:53,090
too even some something I don't know

1089
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:56,180
what that's called but I think there's

1090
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:57,590
something you're like agnostic yeah not

1091
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:59,090
not what's the other one where you don't

1092
00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:01,810
know stick believes in if there's

1093
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:05,030
something there's a being yeah I know

1094
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:08,060
which one I would say agnostic what does

1095
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:12,230
the one not not atheist yeah so agnostic

1096
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:12,620
about you Paco um I don't know man it's

1097
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:18,020
weird

1098
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:19,790
he's a pastor's kid yeah oh you lost

1099
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:22,340
your virginity early didn't you know at

1100
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:29,090
the age of 26 actually that's early for

1101
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:31,670
me oh wow the our question for you then

1102
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:33,860
was the expectation in standard at which

1103
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:34,970
your childhood was was that like did you

1104
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:37,130
feel like you always had to live up to

1105
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:40,280
like what a pastor's son is supposed to

1106
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:43,430
be uh in a way yeah actually learn more

1107
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:46,610
of how to act well I'm staying away from

1108
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:48,710
you maybe you should go into some

1109
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:49,080
Twitter questions oh go for it that's a

1110
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:52,080
good

1111
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:56,190
that's a good transition there's a fan

1112
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:58,320
you if Z Wayne says asks would you

1113
00:44:56,190 --> 00:45:09,690
rather know how you died or when you die

1114
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:12,470
and why neither I mean you don't want to

1115
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:15,270
know no cuz I'm excited for the surprise

1116
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:17,070
but Jordan oh you're dead but if I had

1117
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:18,540
to choose one oh wait wait I'm art is

1118
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:24,570
this the premise that I'm dead already

1119
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:26,340
sure okay I'd rather know oh no when

1120
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:28,800
you're alive yeah like right now okay

1121
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:31,290
would you rather know like right now how

1122
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,270
you die or when like you're gonna let's

1123
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:37,800
say it's like I'm gonna die in three

1124
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:42,240
months versus I'm going to die by a car

1125
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:45,360
crash which if I had to choose one I

1126
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:48,210
guess when yeah I think I would use that

1127
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:50,460
more mm-hmm cuz you could do stuff yeah

1128
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:52,410
what would you do depends on the time so

1129
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:53,910
if I would you still be judging say the

1130
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:55,230
mean dance it depends do I make it that

1131
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:56,820
long like give me a date and I'll take

1132
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:58,770
three months left it's always do you

1133
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:00,870
know subjective time yeah three months

1134
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:02,490
left yeah I was on a lot of time I was

1135
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:05,400
still judge mm-hmm and I would still

1136
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:09,300
finish this podcast a we made it on the

1137
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:10,590
list honesty so sweet yeah okay I mean I

1138
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,030
I mean that's not really the question I

1139
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:13,020
just kind of took you somewhere else but

1140
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:15,270
I mean that's interesting

1141
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,950
no that's what you guys do I don't want

1142
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:18,780
to know when for sure when right yeah

1143
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:21,360
it's more beneficial you can use that

1144
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:24,600
yeah I would probably dude I don't know

1145
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:26,400
what I would want to do actually mmm it

1146
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:28,620
depends on the time I feel like mm-hmm

1147
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,720
what feels like you're gonna die at 178

1148
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:46,040
you Mike oh a long time yeah that's

1149
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:49,410
true okay oh shoot what would you do

1150
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:51,300
close you do paço cashews what if I had

1151
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:54,720
only what I would choose time as well

1152
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:57,140
time yeah David I would choose time ya

1153
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,970
know so we're all the same bore yeah hmm

1154
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:04,910
mmm okay well on to the next question

1155
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:06,349
from uh betters unite I wonder I think

1156
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:08,150
she's our fan

1157
00:47:06,349 --> 00:47:12,799
do you and Beth ever play pranks on each

1158
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:15,529
other no but I feel like I feel like uh

1159
00:47:12,799 --> 00:47:18,019
no we don't but maybe I want to start

1160
00:47:15,529 --> 00:47:19,490
now hmm I like you prank garden a lot

1161
00:47:18,019 --> 00:47:20,990
you prank garden a lot no not really

1162
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:22,519
like when you post up on your Instagram

1163
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:24,319
we kind of like it's not really a prank

1164
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:24,769
or she's kind of a dick yeah it's so

1165
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:26,690
funny

1166
00:47:24,769 --> 00:47:29,390
mm-hmm so that's kind of like a prank

1167
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:35,569
yeah I guess so but it's like she's she

1168
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:38,480
knows about it yeah yeah oh he fakes

1169
00:47:35,569 --> 00:47:40,910
pranks Frank it's not a prank

1170
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:44,510
it's just truth I'm a fake all right no

1171
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:47,510
no no next question CP Valerie what's

1172
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:51,970
your favorite and least favorite about

1173
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:56,599
making choreography the favorite part

1174
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:57,980
would probably just be able to produce a

1175
00:47:56,599 --> 00:48:00,049
message I've like a lot of people that

1176
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:03,049
can help a lot of people Oh Shay but

1177
00:48:00,049 --> 00:48:06,589
it's so real honest um let's see and the

1178
00:48:03,049 --> 00:48:08,839
worst part is probably like the

1179
00:48:06,589 --> 00:48:11,180
self-doubt maybe that comes with making

1180
00:48:08,839 --> 00:48:12,500
stuff like like especially if you're so

1181
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:14,299
protective over like if you have a good

1182
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:16,400
reason why and you're like you become

1183
00:48:14,299 --> 00:48:18,619
like a little bit like man asked me like

1184
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:21,799
perfect and perfect so I don't have that

1185
00:48:18,619 --> 00:48:23,539
as much anymore it feels like um but

1186
00:48:21,799 --> 00:48:24,579
yeah I would say those two things do you

1187
00:48:23,539 --> 00:48:27,170
feel like when you're creating

1188
00:48:24,579 --> 00:48:29,539
choreography for yourself versus other

1189
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:31,609
people do you feel more of that pressure

1190
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:33,200
on when you're performing it or when

1191
00:48:31,609 --> 00:48:35,269
someone else is performing it I feel

1192
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,710
more pressure if it's for me then I do

1193
00:48:35,269 --> 00:48:37,789
for the other person because for me the

1194
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:39,559
other person is actually a lot easier

1195
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:43,099
and I get to see it where like with me

1196
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:45,589
it's like I feel like I can't see myself

1197
00:48:43,099 --> 00:48:47,599
doing it and I already feel whack so

1198
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:51,200
much like the pressures like for me

1199
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:53,240
would be just a hire to make it because

1200
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:55,279
it's just like also my ability sucks

1201
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,779
it's gonna create around the what do you

1202
00:48:55,279 --> 00:48:58,460
mean like right now like I'm not just

1203
00:48:56,779 --> 00:49:00,410
good at dancing as I used to be as far

1204
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:02,839
as like what I can do not ladies

1205
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:04,579
creating creating choreography yeah go

1206
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:07,250
away that's in your head right uh yeah

1207
00:49:04,579 --> 00:49:08,720
but it is for yourself it's like I feel

1208
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:10,760
like I'm more limited on what I can say

1209
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,770
with my body worth other people

1210
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:14,180
well usually people I choose it's like

1211
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:15,650
they have more to say and I can get the

1212
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:18,619
message in my head that I want the world

1213
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:20,840
to know through their their uh their

1214
00:49:18,619 --> 00:49:25,220
bodies like AB yeah there's a lot larger

1215
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:26,359
than yours yeah yeah yeah so um I guess

1216
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:27,680
this is a question that I have since

1217
00:49:26,359 --> 00:49:29,210
we're talking about choreography and

1218
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,130
kind of your art yeah I'll do here I'll

1219
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:35,330
do your solos thank you um but also if

1220
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:39,260
you could only choose one

1221
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:40,849
I guess creative aspect and outlet what

1222
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:43,160
would you pick because you're you're

1223
00:49:40,849 --> 00:49:45,050
actually so multi-talented you mean like

1224
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:46,550
it's annoying like crafts well you said

1225
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:49,369
you think you're into singing right now

1226
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:50,840
yeah but then you I know but you you

1227
00:49:49,369 --> 00:49:52,010
dance and you pretty much like I mean

1228
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,540
like you said you're always learning but

1229
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:55,670
you conquered it I mean you've hit the

1230
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:58,520
tier right like I'm like the top tier of

1231
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:58,849
what a dancer could be like what's the

1232
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,900
higher

1233
00:49:58,849 --> 00:50:02,000
what's higher than what you've done

1234
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,510
become the judge on the biggest dance

1235
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,950
show

1236
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:07,220
there's something really higher than

1237
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:11,900
that right I don't know maybe all right

1238
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:13,880
I think so I mean well what I'm asking

1239
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:16,700
is if you're at that tier right like the

1240
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:19,010
highest here in my perspective it's

1241
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:20,330
almost not as fun right because with

1242
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:22,160
singing it's more interesting because

1243
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:23,800
there's so much new things to learn and

1244
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,420
I feel like you just like learning so I

1245
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:28,730
guess went back to POC was question kind

1246
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:30,320
of went off track um what is what would

1247
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:33,500
you pick I mean would it still be dance

1248
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:36,200
oh uh if I had to choose right now

1249
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:37,520
yeah it probably choreographing because

1250
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,260
I feel like if it was like one thing

1251
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,580
that I can help more people with it

1252
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:43,700
would probably be choreographing pieces

1253
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:45,800
then making music or making people laugh

1254
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:49,040
does that make sense so cuz I feel like

1255
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:50,030
right now the the choreographer I kind

1256
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,500
of just fell into being a choreographer

1257
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:54,500
there's nothing that I really took

1258
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:56,839
serious but I felt it I kind of to be

1259
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:58,430
honest easy and I feel like because it's

1260
00:50:56,839 --> 00:51:00,680
so easy it's not as fun because I want

1261
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:01,880
to feel struggle when I make stuff does

1262
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:03,770
that make does that make sense so

1263
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,540
choreographing like I feel like I would

1264
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:09,290
help more people out that way so I'd

1265
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:12,140
probably coat that okay well oh that was

1266
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:14,720
a good answer yes that's great like you

1267
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:16,099
need that struggle that sorry that you

1268
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,660
don't feel like you've conquered it

1269
00:51:16,099 --> 00:51:19,849
because once you've conquered it then

1270
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,720
you're like I'm done yeah and I feel

1271
00:51:19,849 --> 00:51:23,089
like I mean there's still like a

1272
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:25,369
struggle in creating and core

1273
00:51:23,089 --> 00:51:26,420
but it's it's a lot I think it's because

1274
00:51:25,369 --> 00:51:28,910
I've been around it so long I've been

1275
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:30,680
doing it so long I mean it Ryan's kind

1276
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:32,119
of similar like probably like you know

1277
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:34,279
what you have to do and you know what

1278
00:51:32,119 --> 00:51:37,640
you need to do and it's where is there

1279
00:51:34,279 --> 00:51:38,900
like growth in it or like at one point

1280
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:40,400
in time and again I think you can

1281
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:42,979
constantly grow but you gotta want and

1282
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,359
do that type of things so that's what I

1283
00:51:42,979 --> 00:51:46,910
love singing because you know when

1284
00:51:44,359 --> 00:51:49,670
you're this bad then you can just have

1285
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:53,390
you just keep going wing and then you

1286
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:53,779
know one day you won't be as bad that's

1287
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:55,430
better

1288
00:51:53,779 --> 00:51:58,249
wasn't getting better it is better than

1289
00:51:55,430 --> 00:52:00,559
what I remember yes it's a lot better I

1290
00:51:58,249 --> 00:52:07,069
have a question I'm so you know as a

1291
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:10,609
dancer you need to be in shape you do

1292
00:52:07,069 --> 00:52:13,009
you do you feel like dancers should

1293
00:52:10,609 --> 00:52:14,989
workout do yoga that type of stuff or is

1294
00:52:13,009 --> 00:52:16,339
dancing enough would you say yeah Paco

1295
00:52:14,989 --> 00:52:17,719
it's not like it used to be when we were

1296
00:52:16,339 --> 00:52:20,089
dancing like you'd be a little too lazy

1297
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:24,019
to eat the dancers now are crazy

1298
00:52:20,089 --> 00:52:26,239
man like they're I like running every

1299
00:52:24,019 --> 00:52:28,789
morning they're their diets are freaking

1300
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:30,259
Stern their training mind and body

1301
00:52:28,789 --> 00:52:31,880
learning from some of the greatest

1302
00:52:30,259 --> 00:52:33,109
people all over the world and a big part

1303
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:35,229
of it too is that they have the standard

1304
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:37,849
after their palm because of the phone

1305
00:52:35,229 --> 00:52:40,249
but I would recommend that especially if

1306
00:52:37,849 --> 00:52:42,950
you're like going for it now

1307
00:52:40,249 --> 00:52:45,650
no like no matter what dance taught you

1308
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:46,910
got to be like if every yeah I mean it's

1309
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:49,670
in the Olympics now people are

1310
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:51,170
definitely already big crazy break know

1311
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:54,859
there yet dance actually ballroom and

1312
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:56,630
breaking b-boying and breaking is now in

1313
00:52:54,859 --> 00:52:57,979
the Olympics junior and adult divisions

1314
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:59,539
that's crazy right that's pretty crazy

1315
00:52:57,979 --> 00:53:00,769
so ain't like week they can't have our

1316
00:52:59,539 --> 00:53:03,380
dyes that they use do you know the spam

1317
00:53:00,769 --> 00:53:05,089
musubi is in the tuna hotdogs for $2 20

1318
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:06,979
cents a am/pm ain't gonna work no more

1319
00:53:05,089 --> 00:53:16,549
like that unless you're b-boy Morris but

1320
00:53:06,979 --> 00:53:18,200
that is cut you know that's like in

1321
00:53:16,549 --> 00:53:20,029
every sport right like over the years

1322
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:21,829
every sport they get better and better

1323
00:53:20,029 --> 00:53:23,869
like someone just broke some kid just

1324
00:53:21,829 --> 00:53:26,420
broke Michael Phelps his records right

1325
00:53:23,869 --> 00:53:28,339
yeah a bunch of his records and like kid

1326
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:29,950
yes I'm cool or something yeah something

1327
00:53:28,339 --> 00:53:33,200
like that and then like you know compare

1328
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:36,600
basketball now versus like 50 years ago

1329
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:39,210
Oh Naz is like you're about to say Oh

1330
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:41,340
Braun or Michael Jordan who is that okay

1331
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:43,320
well that's I'm going even further but

1332
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:45,030
like it's it's a whole nother level of

1333
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,920
like athleticism sprinting you know

1334
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:47,340
people used to run marathons in like an

1335
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,800
hour

1336
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:51,300
like slower I don't know what the real

1337
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,010
I'm making that up yeah I know yeah like

1338
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:56,310
over time people are getting better and

1339
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:58,770
better at stuff and at what point I mean

1340
00:53:56,310 --> 00:54:01,020
there's so there's the aspect that you

1341
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:03,000
have to offer is that there's it's not

1342
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:06,530
just physical right yeah in terms of

1343
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:10,050
like I mean I think it's gonna like

1344
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:11,910
improve what I ask is what we what David

1345
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:14,370
and I talked about with music of how

1346
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:16,320
like David loves real quote unquote real

1347
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:18,090
music you love you love like EDM and

1348
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,710
stuff like that too but like like

1349
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:23,130
there's a difference between like the

1350
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:25,080
art of music and then the like formula

1351
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:28,290
yeah like the formula basically so what

1352
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:30,810
do you consider good I think psychology

1353
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:32,550
is 80% and I think physical ability is

1354
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:34,260
actually 20 so these so you're saying

1355
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:35,790
these kids have the physical yeah I

1356
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:37,650
think a lot of kids and then like well

1357
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:40,200
logistics is the one that's where it's

1358
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:42,150
like she's very stern on growth of mind

1359
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,860
and I think any something be always

1360
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:45,570
coming out right now is that there have

1361
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:47,250
a strong balance between mental growth

1362
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:48,480
on top of physical growth and I think

1363
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:50,640
with any craft you could tell the

1364
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,680
difference when someone's like like

1365
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,690
LeBron James I I think it's like a big

1366
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:59,670
part obviously to his physical but his

1367
00:54:54,690 --> 00:55:01,890
mind is like super like brilliant and

1368
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:03,270
he's able to take advantage of both

1369
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:05,430
those things because I think also to

1370
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:07,770
your body is secondary to your mind I

1371
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:09,750
think your mind is the center point to

1372
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:11,850
operating your body so I think just

1373
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:13,350
taking advantage of your brain I think

1374
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:15,780
was a huge part for me at least wife

1375
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:17,160
like I have a lot of received a lot of

1376
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:18,750
outcome for a lot of things that I felt

1377
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:20,540
like I maybe didn't really deserve

1378
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:22,920
compared the person that was physically

1379
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:24,180
what you used to say all the time like

1380
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:26,880
oh I'm not the best breaker

1381
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:28,650
not even close that's choreographer but

1382
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,750
you were smart enough to combine the two

1383
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:33,380
and use it and use your personality to

1384
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:36,930
create the success you have yeah yeah

1385
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:40,980
yeah yeah you're aware of that that's

1386
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:43,500
what you did right yeah I guess that's

1387
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:45,900
yeah yeah I think the mind is very very

1388
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:48,870
important um again I don't know how you

1389
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:50,609
feel David but to while you're on that

1390
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:52,980
subject do you feel like if some

1391
00:55:50,609 --> 00:55:54,900
not in a good mental state or maybe they

1392
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:57,359
just broke up with someone do you feel

1393
00:55:54,900 --> 00:56:00,019
like when they dance it's different than

1394
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:03,239
if they were in a happy relationship uh

1395
00:56:00,019 --> 00:56:04,319
it's definitely be different it's just

1396
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:05,819
whether or not other people will enjoy

1397
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:07,799
it or if they'll enjoy it but I do

1398
00:56:05,819 --> 00:56:12,839
believe it it is different I also

1399
00:56:07,799 --> 00:56:14,609
believe that that type of pain used

1400
00:56:12,839 --> 00:56:16,680
correctly it will end up being something

1401
00:56:14,609 --> 00:56:20,339
really brilliant mmm because there's

1402
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:22,499
like a sense of like emotional high and

1403
00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:24,390
I think with any high emotion it's a lot

1404
00:56:22,499 --> 00:56:25,319
easier to create with those types of

1405
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:27,059
things

1406
00:56:25,319 --> 00:56:31,130
just because it's like you need to get

1407
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:33,900
it out no it's almost like a must yeah

1408
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:35,640
that's good advice again anything you

1409
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:37,319
