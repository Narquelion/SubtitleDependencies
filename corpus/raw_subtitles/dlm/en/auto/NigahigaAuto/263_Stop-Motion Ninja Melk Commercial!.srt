1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,730
of you already know I made my own energy

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,860
drink called ninja milk now that's the

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,630
stuff that's not our slogan get your

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,040
everyday kick ninja milk and like I

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,690
mentioned before I have two other

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,150
partners that I work with who basically

8
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,590
run the business side of ninja Mel I on

9
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,939
the other hand am in charge of the

10
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,000
creative side you know the marketing

11
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,279
since you know I am a well genius when

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,510
it comes to selling things happen to you

13
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:33,390
if this ever happened to you have you

14
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,730
ever happened to this usually it has not

15
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,250
happened to them and I still haven't

16
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,600
really sold any of those products but

17
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,030
that's what makes me a good salesman

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,100
because I never give up anyway about a

19
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,809
few months ago give or take a year I was

20
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,460
given the task for my business partners

21
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:50,370
to come up with a ninja meal commercial

22
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,289
and I just had so many good ideas as you

23
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,940
could probably imagine but like I've

24
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,340
said before my partners and I were just

25
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,899
not we have creative differences let's

26
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,129
just say that you just don't understand

27
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,510
the salesman's mind they don't

28
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:03,030
understand what people want they're like

29
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,290
oh we've actually built businesses and

30
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,390
made them into multi-million dollar

31
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,520
companies whatever big deal anyway I

32
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:13,860
have good ideas and this is basically

33
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:15,630
what happened all right so I have a

34
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,530
bunch of great ideas I think you guys

35
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:22,140
are gonna love ideas or they you know

36
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,159
these ideas done or cuz I was under the

37
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,770
impression that they're gonna be

38
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:29,040
finished by now oh yeah they're finished

39
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,060
in my head I was gonna I just have

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,409
something ideas I want you guys to pick

41
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,729
the best one and then I could was just

42
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:34,920
gonna knock it out and like a couple

43
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:37,259
days or something well let's just see

44
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,450
what you have sure all right

45
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,450
so for my first idea

46
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,110
we um ffs

47
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,790
okay sorry

48
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:01,650
so for my first idea I was thinking well

49
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,420
when you hear ninja milk first things

50
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:06,930
you think of ninjas milk

51
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,759
what if ordinary guy picks up a can and

52
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,979
all of a sudden when he drinks it boom

53
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,960
turns into a ninja starts fighting off

54
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,120
this huge army of other normal people

55
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,010
and I'm ninjas just beating everybody up

56
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,410
and at the end it cuts to a pasture of

57
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:22,260
that ninja on all fours and you see me

58
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:25,440
walk in and start milking that ninja

59
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:31,050
strained to the can right there text

60
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:33,480
pops up ninja milk how dairy how dare he

61
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:36,030
milking and ninja isn't very appetizing

62
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,280
kinda graphic what else do you have

63
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,290
you don't like okay so um this one might

64
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,890
need some explaining for 30 seconds of

65
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:47,780
this commercial

66
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:50,130
it just says yup period that's it yeah

67
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:53,130
it's because it's the answer to the

68
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:55,590
famous got milk but ours are just yep

69
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,060
okay I mean maybe you could have a

70
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,360
little more or you know like don't

71
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,269
either

72
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,959
okay so Red Bull right they say they

73
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:02,820
give you wings

74
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,709
what if our commercial we do like an

75
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,300
animated thing like theirs except for us

76
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:10,230
we say what ninja Moe gives you a sword

77
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,640
because we can't give you wings you know

78
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:13,800
what let me go back to the first idea

79
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,090
right with the milk and the ninja what

80
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,380
if we just change the slogan I know it

81
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:20,430
sounds disgusting but what if we changed

82
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:23,730
it to ninja milk utterly delicious like

83
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,320
utters is in utterly like the nip like

84
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:27,299
the nipple thing the concept new are

85
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:32,790
those are nipples of the car do they

86
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:36,049
have the data and the data or maybe move

87
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:38,850
on to the next one next one yeah that's

88
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:42,030
that's it that's all I see it

89
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:44,700
it's about that wrong so this is it this

90
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,799
is all you've come up with yeah why no I

91
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,840
say forget it I think we should just pay

92
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,880
someone to do this we what we can't

93
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,070
waste any more time well I have I have

94
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,530
one last idea you didn't hear that we

95
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:57,989
don't need any more job no I promise I'm

96
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,130
telling you this one is really good it's

97
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:00,959
just like it's just like the Nintendo

98
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,610
paper one or the cardboard video you

99
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,780
like it's it's a stop-motion so if we

100
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,400
gave you this chance you're gonna take

101
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,780
this seriously this time serious as a

102
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,480
cue

103
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,130
and you're sure no stupid puns it's

104
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,550
actually going to be something cool cool

105
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:14,990
as a cute I think I was a line earlier

106
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:17,209
we even have time to get that done we

107
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,620
can't afford two maybe three weeks three

108
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:22,430
weeks at most there's any way possible

109
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:25,190
