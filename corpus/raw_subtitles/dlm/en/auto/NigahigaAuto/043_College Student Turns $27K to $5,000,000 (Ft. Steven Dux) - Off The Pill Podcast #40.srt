1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,570
so we get dumped by someone you cannot

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:04,890
feel like not very confident so you want

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,690
to gain confidence back by cheating

4
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,980
something and the reason why a lot of

5
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,910
people think stock markets gambling

6
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,460
because they don't have a specific

7
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,719
strategies and we have about two

8
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:22,380
schooling that is over two million

9
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:23,500
already welcome back to another episode

10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,120
of off the peel podcast

11
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:29,790
[Music]

12
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,890
all right today we got David in the

13
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:34,020
moderator seat we got I don't know why I

14
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,320
started dancing this right next to me

15
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,600
I'm Ryan and we have a very special

16
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,210
guest and also for the first time ever

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,770
all a sponsor of today's podcast mr.

18
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:49,770
Steven Ducks he's young 25 25 years old

19
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:52,770
like just very recently who basically

20
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,629
turned $27,000 correct me if I'm wrong

21
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,210
yeah into four million before the age of

22
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:59,489
24 and you're 25 right now 25 right so

23
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:03,300
five million dollars yeah so five-minute

24
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:05,220
dollars in well when did you start start

25
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,229
when I was 19 officially that is

26
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,970
critical in five years basically five

27
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:10,560
six years million bucks a year for

28
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:14,640
something like that summer it a good

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,320
yeah and that's why I'm intrigued but

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,759
but just just because I've kind of

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,340
butchered your whole story and what you

32
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:24,180
actually do I'll let you explain it okay

33
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,520
so it's gonna be a little bit different

34
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,860
and compared to other stock brokerage

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,649
not a lot of structure here is Apple

36
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,750
[Music]

37
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:35,759
Tesla Amazon's all those stocks or

38
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,880
options that guys here pretty much all

39
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:42,660
the time not a TV but what I specialized

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:46,950
I trade is the stocks are have a lot

41
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:48,959
lower market caps which it means the

42
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,539
stock worth a lot less compared to

43
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:54,119
Amazon's and smaller ones smaller

44
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:55,500
companies right and I'm just just as a

45
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,920
disclaimer for everyone out there and

46
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,050
and for you Stephen we're gonna have to

47
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,610
have you dumb this down a lot for us

48
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,110
because we're not experienced in this

49
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:08,160
world so even just what you just said

50
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:10,800
yeah I'm like kind of following well

51
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,390
we'll ask you though okay so you do you

52
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,709
deal with more like smaller stocks and

53
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,000
not like the big company the big

54
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:16,440
companies exactly that so what does that

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,959
mean exactly when you're saying you're

56
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,020
you trade ok so there's about three

57
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,330
sections of what I typically categorize

58
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,280
all the market caps so three sections

59
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:29,459
one is billion dollar cap which you

60
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,920
includes Amazon's and Tesla's or all the

61
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:34,500
bigger companies then after that we

62
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,930
follow with under 1 billion so will be

63
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,379
anywhere around 500 million to one bit

64
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,819
in this category is called mid cap so

65
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:43,859
that

66
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:46,489
little companies and kind of big are not

67
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:50,280
roofs with an example of one of those um

68
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:52,349
that's a kind of big company they most

69
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,700
of them are biotechs so they're making

70
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:56,640
medicines okay

71
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:59,730
testing their drugs and getting through

72
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,129
free one first two and then finally get

73
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:04,920
their FDA approval so majority the

74
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:07,829
stocks are sometime there's all types of

75
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,510
right types of stocks you can't be valid

76
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:12,780
tax it can be technology companies and

77
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:15,659
stuff like that and after that we follow

78
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,090
with anywhere between twenty million to

79
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:20,220
100 million so that's where I trade

80
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:23,010
that's considered small that's

81
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,590
considered small yeah is there anything

82
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:27,090
smaller than that like yes there is some

83
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:29,129
of company only worth about two million

84
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,290
to 10 million and they're in the stock

85
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:33,989
market yes buy and trade you can buy and

86
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:35,250
trade they're typically Nasdaq and the

87
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:38,189
bigger companies are there in your

88
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,200
exchange then if there's a lot of

89
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:42,269
smaller companies there will be in Pink

90
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,699
Sheets so just three have you heard

91
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:46,930
about pink sheets from the wolf of Wall

92
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:49,519
Street yes pink sheets are very sketchy

93
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:52,949
[Laughter]

94
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,540
they made the movie yeah okay so

95
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:56,849
generally when you hear about pink

96
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,879
sheets are pretty much garbage companies

97
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:01,590
and there's that back in twenty sixteen

98
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:04,049
twenty fifteen or a little bit early or

99
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,479
twenty twelve there's a lot of people

100
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:08,099
are pumping dump the stock so they're

101
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,139
sending out all types of emails saying

102
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:12,449
all this that's gonna go up and very

103
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:13,919
similar to awful Wall Street and except

104
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:15,419
they're doing the emails instead of

105
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:17,609
phone calls and now that people just buy

106
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:19,079
the stock and the instead ofwell dump

107
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:21,810
the stock and all the investors lose

108
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,520
money so the pumping means that a lot of

109
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,810
they get a lot of different people to

110
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,940
buy the stock and then the stock price

111
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,800
goes up up up up up yeah and then they

112
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,419
all sell it because other people are

113
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,770
like oh it's doing really well let me

114
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:34,020
put some money into it the average

115
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,880
people right and then and then it they

116
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,099
dump it because and then they all sell

117
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:41,250
it and then it drops the price right

118
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:42,960
they don't really sell it so let's say

119
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,580
as an average person I don't know

120
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,259
nothing about stocks and somebody sent

121
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,150
me an email this thing's gonna go up to

122
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:50,820
a couple thousand percent well of course

123
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:53,010
I'm interested so at first I'm gonna be

124
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,220
a little bit skeptical I'm gonna buy it

125
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,380
at one

126
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,030
and stuccos to files oh I missed a lot

127
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,280
of prophets so I'm gonna add more

128
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:03,670
putting more money into it and when star

129
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:06,190
goes to 20 and that's where the people

130
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,990
inside the stock they're holding a large

131
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,630
amount of shares and they sell the

132
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,580
stocks so when they sell I'm stuck

133
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,230
because I can't sell anymore if your

134
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,420
stock is already down 50 percent 70

135
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,560
percent it's not gonna go back up so

136
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:20,350
it's a scam it's a scam

137
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,880
yes is that illegal yes I remember in

138
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,870
that movie I thought they were doing

139
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,380
like illegal things

140
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:29,530
okay so pump and dumps it is illegal a

141
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:31,930
lot of people get caught basis and yeah

142
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,700
it's very sketchy so house opens sorry

143
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,950
yeah no no I'm just wondering I'm trying

144
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,210
to because I'm that's based off like the

145
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,160
movie and it has it like a negative

146
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:41,110
connotation around there right yeah I'm

147
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,360
trying to figure out what got to tie you

148
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:46,150
into that okay what do you describe what

149
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:50,500
you do and dumb down as much as you can

150
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:53,760
okay so what I do is I I study their

151
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:59,260
methods of I used to trade Pink Sheets

152
00:05:53,760 --> 00:06:01,420
almost 50 times out of mana trades and I

153
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,880
will study the market makers so people

154
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:06,250
are inside the stock and I will study

155
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,840
their methods well they see and what

156
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:13,120
time would they dump so I will go into

157
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,650
the stock they pumped up before and I

158
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,720
will see there's gonna be a specific

159
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:21,280
pattern now when they see yeah they were

160
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,270
dumped the stock and so I basically want

161
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,640
to short the stock

162
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:27,550
I will go against us the stock going up

163
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:29,560
and the more the stock goes down the

164
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:31,960
more money I make so when a decides to

165
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,640
dump the stock one day and I'm shorting

166
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,470
I will make money instead of losing

167
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:38,800
money by buying stock so when you say

168
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:40,960
they are these people that you like do

169
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,600
you know like where they they are or who

170
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,080
they are no I have so yours but there's

171
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,760
a group of random people who have like a

172
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,940
certain pattern in the way they trade

173
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:55,390
sell and buy yeah it was shorting me

174
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:56,980
shorting is basically the opposite of

175
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:58,720
buying so when you buy Oh at one

176
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,790
daughter you sell at two daughter you

177
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,530
make money but we are shorting you

178
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:05,110
shorting out what two daughter buy it

179
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:07,580
back at one dollar okay so you actually

180
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:10,490
go against you don't go for

181
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,409
don't go ever ever no no interest about

182
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:14,060
10% of the time do you think it's safe

183
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:16,069
is that is there a reason for that is it

184
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,530
safer okay so a lot of people ask me

185
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:20,180
that question so shorting we are going

186
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:24,199
against a stock let's say when the stock

187
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:26,120
goes goes from two to five we are

188
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:27,560
showing that - you're actually losing

189
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,719
over a hundred percent of your

190
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,909
investment because you're shorting I -

191
00:07:29,719 --> 00:07:34,189
it goes to four or you losing one person

192
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:35,810
goes to file more than that now if

193
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:37,009
you're buying in stock if stock goes to

194
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,569
one to zero

195
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:42,639
you only lose about 100 percent and

196
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:46,129
that's it you can't lose more negative I

197
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,919
see that's the risk of shorten now

198
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:50,919
Shirley requires a lot of methods risk

199
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:54,800
management how do you manage your risk

200
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:57,349
that's a whole different area for me to

201
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,740
cover but if you have a really good risk

202
00:07:57,349 --> 00:08:03,139
management shorting does have much more

203
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:06,740
as compared to going mom especially on

204
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:08,900
these small cap stocks right because

205
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,550
generally the reason why they're small

206
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:14,419
caps because their fundamentals are

207
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:16,400
really bad so they're basically when so

208
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:18,740
when stock goes in when the company goes

209
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,750
public and the reason why they go into

210
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,430
public because they need money they need

211
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,139
people that you buy the stock days and

212
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:27,289
can do offering to raise money for their

213
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:29,659
projects when you have a really small

214
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:32,269
company you need money to grow your to

215
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:34,610
grow your company that's why yeah well

216
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:35,810
before we get more into like exactly how

217
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:39,949
you do things I kind of want to know

218
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:41,870
like just the origin like so I mean I

219
00:08:39,949 --> 00:08:44,300
have a fact here that like and I said it

220
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:46,670
earlier you took $27,000 and turned it

221
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:49,399
into 4 million before the age of 24 yeah

222
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:51,500
how well for one how did you get the

223
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:53,329
27,000 to start okay because a lot of

224
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,860
people be like well that's easy to do

225
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:57,230
when you have so much money just a lot

226
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:00,079
for a lot of people right yeah how did

227
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:04,190
you get it to start and then also what

228
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:06,440
got you into this okay so when I was 19

229
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,910
I think I was uh I was one year later

230
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,220
and compared to other people because I

231
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:16,459
took one year off to narang where were

232
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:17,660
you I was 13 so change students and camp

233
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:20,279
here took a one-year of just learning

234
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:23,100
the language then go to high school

235
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:23,879
in Cincinnati then going to the college

236
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,560
Cincinnati

237
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:27,810
yeah how did you learn the language

238
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,509
though like we just taking classes or

239
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:31,970
were you watching light no I had I had

240
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:35,279
an American girlfriend and I had

241
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:36,540
American host been me so Wow that's what

242
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,910
were they he just kind of picked it up

243
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:41,819
yeah but why Cincinnati like it's old

244
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:43,470
yeah folks I supposed to go to bigger

245
00:09:41,819 --> 00:09:46,439
cities and there is a bunch of at that

246
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,540
time because there's not a very good

247
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:50,579
relationship between the worlds China

248
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,980
and American it's just starting to

249
00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:55,529
establish more exchanges going back and

250
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:58,230
forth so that program was just initiated

251
00:09:55,529 --> 00:10:01,290
and not very long ago then that time now

252
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:03,779
nobody is very very familiar and that's

253
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:06,600
where a bunch of skinny people comes in

254
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:08,009
and it can take because it because the

255
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,100
Chinese parish doesn't really know

256
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:12,930
English you know take advantage trigger

257
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:16,430
Vantage of it that's why that's how I

258
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:18,410
end up being Cincinnati yeah Wow okay so

259
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:19,949
again you so you started with the

260
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,600
$27,000 yeah

261
00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:23,279
is that just family might like how did

262
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,899
you get how did you start off with that

263
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,819
amount that's not an easy amount to

264
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:29,910
acquire for the average person yes and

265
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:33,660
at that time I think I was working at a

266
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:35,040
dorm in in the school so I was taking

267
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,930
night shifts because all the morning she

268
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:42,529
forgot to take other people so I was

269
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:42,529
basically working around 12 p.m. like a

270
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,699
literally just working a regular night

271
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:50,189
one more than a nine-to-five but working

272
00:10:47,699 --> 00:10:53,279
a job and saving yeah they pay me a lot

273
00:10:50,189 --> 00:10:57,329
more so that's why it took me about a

274
00:10:53,279 --> 00:11:01,259
year to save them save that amount and

275
00:10:57,329 --> 00:11:03,600
plus some of that like I would say 70%

276
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:06,689
come from the job 30% come from the

277
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,699
parents okay and they spotted you a

278
00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:11,550
little bit not spy me a little bit it's

279
00:11:08,699 --> 00:11:15,930
it's part of the tuition oh is it yeah

280
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:16,790
okay yeah okay so that's so you saved up

281
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,680
you had this

282
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:22,170
$27,000 and what just what made you be

283
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,180
like hey I think I can do this stock

284
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:27,930
thing like what did you get into it okay

285
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:30,990
so I was in this engineering project and

286
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:34,259
I had the idea of building a generator

287
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:37,980
and that time I were studying

288
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:39,930
nanotechnologies so well the professor

289
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,180
comes and say well well we don't have

290
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:44,759
enough to but we don't have enough funds

291
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,620
to fund the project and that's where I

292
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:52,579
think about whoa we need some fun so I

293
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:55,290
better just go and make some money and

294
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:56,699
also uh that's how I also got dumped by

295
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:59,429
my girlfriends I was a little bit

296
00:11:56,699 --> 00:12:01,679
motivated to to make money to make

297
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:03,089
changes well can i I mean if it's too

298
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,519
personally enough to answer but is it

299
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:07,529
money related or is it just like I'm

300
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,980
gonna show her it sounds like the

301
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:12,449
Facebook movie like story doesn't it

302
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:15,300
what's the reasoning I mean are you

303
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:16,920
bringing that up so so we get dumped by

304
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,209
someone you cannot feel like and not

305
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,679
very confident so you only gain

306
00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:22,110
confidence back by cheating something

307
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,399
and that's why I want to achieve

308
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:26,759
something insignificant and that's

309
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:28,259
that's why I just decided to get me the

310
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:30,199
stock market because at that time as

311
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:34,259
exchange students you can't really work

312
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:36,179
and you can't really invest because you

313
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:37,649
don't have a correct identities so

314
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:40,439
anything can do is to trade the

315
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:40,949
exchanges you can't do that oh wow did

316
00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:43,559
you just

317
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:45,779
I mean you understood stocks before no I

318
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:47,790
have no I just looked into it so I just

319
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:49,980
started on youtube and watch people

320
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:54,809
expanding what the stock market is buy

321
00:12:49,980 --> 00:13:00,179
some books stock for dummies yeah so I

322
00:12:54,809 --> 00:13:02,850
was trading so a node ETF which is it's

323
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:05,429
not a specific company so it's basically

324
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:06,959
it's every day has volatility going up

325
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:09,000
and down so it's basically trading that

326
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,519
but every day is only moving about one

327
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,709
to two percent so I wasn't making that

328
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,679
much money but I see the potential let's

329
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:18,389
say if I invest $500 I can make twenty

330
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:20,279
five and thirty dollars per a day

331
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:23,069
it makes me feel good right because you

332
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:26,880
came up a little bit yeah so that time I

333
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:28,889
wasn't making $15 $13 an hour but you

334
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,350
can make $30 in a couple of minutes

335
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:34,170
that's not considered really good so

336
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:37,230
after that I was looking for more

337
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:42,630
aggressive income and I took a look of

338
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:44,850
add to the smoke cap market and I saw

339
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:46,639
there's one stock went from I think was

340
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:49,610
one

341
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:53,339
120-some home ridiculous like that and

342
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:55,470
basically every often they will have one

343
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:58,470
star going from one to sixty one to 50

344
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:02,310
that's a couple thousand percent gang in

345
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:03,750
only two days right so I was trying to

346
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:06,630
think how they can capture that and

347
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:08,370
that's where I started to get into the

348
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:10,529
market I'm trading right now mm-hmm

349
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:12,810
but when you say that I mean I'm sure it

350
00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:14,760
always looks very like oh man I just

351
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:17,040
missed on something so big like that's

352
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,060
also trap in itself don't you think yeah

353
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,820
yes it is

354
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:23,550
that's called fear of missing out it's

355
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,959
conformal yeah okay hat I mean it

356
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,310
happens there's a reason why it's almost

357
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,839
like gambling right there's a reason why

358
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:30,720
people keep putting in money and and

359
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,550
going hoping they just get lucky but

360
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,290
you're a process isn't based around that

361
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:36,269
my process is not based on that at all

362
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,220
it looks like gambling it's not gambling

363
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:39,480
at all and the reason why a lot of

364
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,410
people think stock markets gambling

365
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,630
because they don't have a specific

366
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:46,320
strategies and you can if you think

367
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:49,709
about a lot of hedge funds like for like

368
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,389
Goldman Sachs and bigger hedge funds

369
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:53,940
they're winning a hundred million dollar

370
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:57,449
a day and they're winning 90% at the

371
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:59,970
time so they're opening 228 trading 220

372
00:14:57,449 --> 00:15:02,760
I think was 200 trading days or

373
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:05,510
something ridiculous and their gains are

374
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,980
significant more than their losses right

375
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:10,980
they have a system yeah a system they

376
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:14,100
have a our algo system or computer

377
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:16,170
trading or some type of high our

378
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,870
long-term high winning percentage

379
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:21,329
pattern or high strategy they're using

380
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:22,110
for a while so well there's gotta be

381
00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:26,279
something like that

382
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:28,230
and it's very similar to industry right

383
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:30,839
now on pretty much every single industry

384
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:33,029
either is youtubers or really stay

385
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:34,980
people or people do in South America

386
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:37,800
there's only 10% people can be extremely

387
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,149
right as full right so pretty much the

388
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,519
same laws and a lot of people are

389
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:43,410
thinking of stock market it's now for

390
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,110
them but it really depends on how much

391
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:48,329
work you put into but I mean like in the

392
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:52,199
stock market it's a little different in

393
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:53,790
that I feel like if you and all these

394
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:55,800
other companies are winning so often

395
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:58,410
yeah that means there's a ton of people

396
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,980
who are constantly losing yes so those

397
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,540
people

398
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,010
I mean there's the there has its like

399
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,510
energy right there's it doesn't money

400
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:04,860
just doesn't appear yeah has to come

401
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:09,180
from somewhere so these people that are

402
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:10,529
losing in a way I mean like if everyone

403
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,120
starts winning and if you're giving away

404
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:13,709
I mean your whole thing is you want to

405
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,389
help educate people right yeah wouldn't

406
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:17,519
that affect your own business no there

407
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:20,160
are so many people right I mean I don't

408
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,480
but in theory right in theory if all

409
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,279
these companies if everyone starts

410
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,720
catching on basically what you're saying

411
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,870
is there's always gonna be dummies oh

412
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,170
there's always a be done yeah and that

413
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:33,120
the you what like what is your goal

414
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:35,370
essentially right now okay so my goal

415
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,889
from the very beginning is I started

416
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:40,529
when I was a newbie I was a newbie and I

417
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:43,230
didn't get that many help from people it

418
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:45,180
took me about one year looking at the

419
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:47,399
market consistently eight hours every

420
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,940
single day without non-stop even the

421
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,410
holidays

422
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,500
well holidays I was studying for

423
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:54,209
statistics but and it took me a while to

424
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,940
really figure out what's working what's

425
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:59,639
not working so if I can give this to

426
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,889
people and that can help all younger

427
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:04,890
people that when I want to have their

428
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:07,709
dreams it will take much less time for

429
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:09,209
them to achieve their goals okay so I

430
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:11,429
have a question though the way that you

431
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:13,919
came about it it's just like your

432
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:16,020
ability to recognize patterns that you

433
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,030
feel like give you a lot of success or

434
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:21,299
is it something that almost any person

435
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:25,890
can see it's pretty much everybody can

436
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:28,470
see if you're a nerd what to do so the

437
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:30,570
the way I come out all those patterns is

438
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:34,860
I will track about a thousand samples

439
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:37,380
and up one specific pattern and I will

440
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:39,480
calculate how many times doing how many

441
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,549
times do I lose now will show me what

442
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,710
say if you trade this pattern for three

443
00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:46,950
years ninety five percent can wink I

444
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:49,020
presume can news and well I would take

445
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:52,049
that trade all day and you favor peers

446
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:53,460
your peers and also attract a frequency

447
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:55,140
a frequency of the patterns so how many

448
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:58,740
times they haven't per year so I can use

449
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:01,230
that frequency times how much reward I

450
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:04,470
can make on each trade I can simulate

451
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:07,590
again of how much money can make for a

452
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:09,270
year mmm and this pattern that you saw

453
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,600
and you're studying is it something that

454
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:13,210
was already

455
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,679
I just figured out and previously talked

456
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:17,289
about is it something that you kind of

457
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:18,789
pioneered some of the strategy a career

458
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:21,639
day that by myself some of you are

459
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:23,710
already there from the books and stuff

460
00:18:21,639 --> 00:18:25,980
you read yeah okay there's there's so

461
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:28,240
many different patterns and techniques

462
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,570
you know there's a lot of different

463
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,429
companies that have you know different

464
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:35,259
strategies and they sell their their

465
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:36,639
sale they sell their strategies yes kind

466
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:39,610
of like what you got you guys are doing

467
00:18:36,639 --> 00:18:41,889
as well what's what's a differentiator

468
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:43,539
between your strategy and all the other

469
00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:45,100
thousand strategies that are out there

470
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:47,559
okay so when you are search on internet

471
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,840
says how to trade that will penny stocks

472
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:51,940
how to trade micro cap stocks wait when

473
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,250
you when you searching there's gonna be

474
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:56,350
a thousand people come up and you don't

475
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,179
know where to start and so I think the

476
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:00,549
very fundamental thing you need to look

477
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:02,679
at is people's track record

478
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:05,230
do you have account statements laying

479
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:07,389
out does this person show you see is he

480
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:10,210
consistent profitable for the last five

481
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:12,070
years and if he is not then it's not

482
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:15,519
somebody wanna learn from and other

483
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:19,179
people just showing their cars no people

484
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:21,879
on YouTube showing their cars houses to

485
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:23,529
lure people in to buy their program but

486
00:19:21,879 --> 00:19:26,500
they don't really have any official

487
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:27,850
track record mm-hmm that's called

488
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,279
lifestyle marketing and I hate that

489
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:32,230
button right but you have some stuff

490
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:35,230
that you kind of brought with us right

491
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:36,789
that like explain to me what we're

492
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:38,649
looking at because that this looks crazy

493
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:41,860
it looks like you're making a beat or

494
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:44,259
something okay okay so the green number

495
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:46,240
right here they realize so this is how

496
00:19:44,259 --> 00:19:47,440
much I made today sorry real quick if

497
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,179
you could just because we have some

498
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,600
audio listeners so maybe this is a

499
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:53,980
program people can oh yeah okay so you

500
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,870
want me to talk about the program like

535
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,140
is that normal

536
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:28,330
pretty normal yeah on average you make

537
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:31,390
about 30 grand a day not averaging 30

538
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:32,500
grand a day but it really comes and goes

539
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:38,350
you know can't really tell

540
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:41,380
I think 30 grand every every three days

541
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:44,620
hmm so some some biggest lost days

542
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:47,170
biggest last days for me will be seventy

543
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:49,720
thousand well I think it's mean that I

544
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:53,380
only take that loss is pretty much about

545
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:55,900
two three times a year and the biggest

546
00:21:53,380 --> 00:22:00,040
gain that made is two hundred thousand

547
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:03,130
three hundred dollars today and so I

548
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:05,890
guess with a this is an automated

549
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:07,870
program or do you have to put in

550
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:10,390
specific numbers in what you want to do

551
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:12,130
according to the patterns yes this is

552
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:14,200
what do you want to do specifically

553
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:16,240
let's say we want to short stock at this

554
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,550
time then you click short mm-hmm and

555
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,460
it's not 40 holloman air can't recognize

556
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:23,470
patterns and god yeah and why do you use

557
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:25,240
this program versus cuz I have some

558
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:27,790
stocks as well I mean I'm not a date

559
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,740
trader but I use like a trade

560
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:31,810
what's it what's the biggest difference

561
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,120
between a trade and a software that's

562
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:36,400
more looks a little more complicated

563
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,930
okay so I'm gonna give a very

564
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,970
the painting about Brokerage out there

565
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:41,980
yeah and you guys hear about probably

566
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:45,220
Interactive Brokers e-trade Robinhood

567
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:47,710
probably most popular and Robin Hood I

568
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:49,540
don't like that the way you see

569
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:51,820
everything is free but when you're

570
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:54,730
buying a stock especially for beginners

571
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:56,830
they're taking your entries so basically

572
00:22:54,730 --> 00:23:00,130
they say you bought at one and they will

573
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:03,040
execute you add 1.05 what I mean

574
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:05,080
executing at 1.05 so when you want to

575
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:08,140
buy at one daughter but you actually

576
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:10,420
bought at 1.05 mm-hmm so all that zero

577
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:12,430
point buy for them belongs to Robin Hood

578
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,730
but I thought Robin Hood is free yes

579
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,530
free

580
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:16,870
yeah it's company to three trades right

581
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:19,600
when you buy it they were taking money

582
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:21,700
from tax yes I could tax

583
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,880
yeah so they actually charge you behind

584
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:27,400
the scenes on your profits yes if you

585
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,540
get yeah now when you get profit no it

586
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,010
doesn't really matter we can get profit

587
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:33,310
when you lose it will still take partial

588
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:36,520
when you sale hmm yeah also we again

589
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:39,370
take fire showing use mmm in or so they

590
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:42,390
win all the time that's why I don't

591
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:44,710
really like Robin Hood but it's I mean

592
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:46,540
yes the reason don't really like a Robin

593
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:49,360
Hood now follow three trade Interactive

594
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:52,180
Brokers the one I like the best they do

595
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:55,090
charge a very small amount when you are

596
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:56,710
buying certain amount of shares but if

597
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:58,120
you have a really small town they say

598
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:00,250
you only have a couple thousand dollars

599
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:02,770
or five hundred dollars I think to

600
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:06,040
produce the best for you follow on that

601
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:07,690
and brokerage take dollars per trade you

602
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,940
said they would take about ten dollars

603
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:12,250
on our trade and when you place the

604
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:14,200
order in the total amount it should take

605
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:16,060
ten dollars no matter how many shares

606
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:22,240
your trading mmm some of the broker you

607
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:23,770
take 0.0004 and per share so so the

608
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,170
reason right now that you're kind of

609
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:27,610
doing like this podcast and you've made

610
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:28,870
other appearances in other youtubers

611
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:31,090
videos and stuff like that is because

612
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:34,300
you're trying to get yourself out there

613
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:35,560
so that you can kind of I guess promote

614
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,400
the fact that you're kind of being you

615
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,510
want to be a teacher

616
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,910
those aren't degree like you gotyou

617
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:42,280
offer courses yeah to teach people like

618
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:44,080
us we know nothing from the very

619
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,550
beginning how you can get started in

620
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:50,080
doing something like this correct yeah

621
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:50,710
and you really believe that you're not

622
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,810
special

623
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:56,500
that in terms of like you need you

624
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:57,760
averaged um person like me or Paco you

625
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,850
could learn something like this if we

626
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:06,340
took your courses yes okay yeah I know

627
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:08,860
and just because I quit I quit you know

628
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:13,210
you know I didn't bring in David I'm its

629
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:14,860
mark yeah but so people like I mean

630
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:16,450
obviously this sounds like just seeing

631
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,710
that number oh you made 33 grand of

632
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:19,120
course I'm interested of course

633
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:21,100
everybody who hears is interested but

634
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,990
naturally the skeptic in me the skeptic

635
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,700
and everyone is like yes so this sounds

636
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:27,810
too good to be true this guy seems Shady

637
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,810
not that I think you're Shady

638
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:33,520
but you know why should people take you

639
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:34,330
as legitimate like why explain does what

640
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,120
makes you different from your average

641
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:38,920
shark or the things they see on the big

642
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,710
short or the things they see on Wall

643
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:44,530
Street you know okay so the thing is a

644
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:45,820
lot of people out there as I said the

645
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:48,490
very fundamental thing is they don't

646
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:50,920
have their track record and I have about

647
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:54,190
I think I have my verification on

648
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:57,580
2018-2019 and because a lot of people

649
00:25:54,190 --> 00:26:00,040
did have a very very skepticism so like

650
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:02,500
they they doubted me that I actually

651
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:05,730
turned twenty seven thousand into nine

652
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:09,060
hundred thousand within a year and so I

653
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:11,560
replicate that performances in 2018 by

654
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:16,330
auditing my calcium and say every single

655
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:18,670
month to a CPA firm and I did it so if

656
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:20,290
you guys are a lot of people are skip

657
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:22,420
ilysm they can look at my account

658
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:25,120
statements and you put that out there

659
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:26,620
public yeah yeah and that cost you money

660
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,600
to do as well it cost

661
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:30,910
yeah they cost a lot cause like 50k

662
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,950
sometimes even every time you do an

663
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:35,890
audit every year yeah oh wow

664
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:41,290
it's expensive to audit that's just

665
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:43,150
that's six days of works okay and also I

666
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:45,160
also review the one of my count

667
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:47,860
statements that for the maximum

668
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:50,260
performances I turned forty one thousand

669
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:54,970
into three hundred thousand you know

670
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:57,460
Martha so now I guess um also with your

671
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:59,980
cuz how do people learn your stuff is it

672
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:01,690
a online courses or book it's an online

673
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,100
course online course and about how long

674
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:05,799
does it take or is it like you

675
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:08,409
at your own pace so typically will take

676
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:10,179
about a year year and half to pretty

677
00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:11,889
much no other strategies and getting

678
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:13,960
settled in your head so it's almost like

679
00:27:11,889 --> 00:27:16,480
a trade school in a way yeah when you

680
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,159
say a year and a half is it doing this

681
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,799
everyday for a year and a half doing

682
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,840
this pretty much study about at least

683
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,159
two to four hours a day okay you've got

684
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,960
something that we're like what you did

685
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,179
is work pretty much holiday to save up

686
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,830
and then study for like a couple few

687
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:32,259
hours so going to school and then also

688
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:33,610
yeah it's pretty much the same pretty

689
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:35,350
much very everything that you going to

690
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:37,029
school or going getting good at sports

691
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:39,970
they take you right how long have you

692
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:42,759
been giving out these courses I've been

693
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:45,519
giving out for a year almost two years

694
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:48,129
now and have you had people yes succeed

695
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:52,350
and have you had people fail good angry

696
00:27:48,129 --> 00:27:56,350
customers yes we did so we have at least

697
00:27:52,350 --> 00:28:00,070
20 students not it's already over at

698
00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:01,330
least 200,000 and we have about two

699
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:06,850
students that is over two million

700
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:09,279
already in a year or a year yeah and we

701
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:10,929
did have customers that they won't speak

702
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:14,830
Spanish so like they can't understand

703
00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:17,590
the course that's yeah but is there

704
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:19,360
anyone who took it and they just didn't

705
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:20,529
see results and maybe it's because they

706
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,690
weren't studying or maybe they weren't

707
00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:24,279
doing it right but like there has to be

708
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:25,929
people who like it there's no way you

709
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:27,879
have a hundred percent track record it

710
00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:29,139
not 100 percent tracker as I said a lot

711
00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:32,559
of people they don't really put the work

712
00:28:29,139 --> 00:28:34,629
in right failed and they have very angry

713
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:38,110
a lot of the 20 people how many roughly

714
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:42,399
do you think so 20 percent I would say

715
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:44,409
20 year of 120 out of 100 yeah kind of

716
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:48,070
like didn't so it's a pretty good

717
00:28:44,409 --> 00:28:50,799
percentage 20 out of 100 are doing well

718
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:51,639
or not doing well 20 out of hundred are

719
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,549
doing very well

720
00:28:51,639 --> 00:28:56,919
mmm do you well then probably 50 out of

721
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:59,830
hundred okay yeah yeah that makes sense

722
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:03,610
because I mean so so this track record

723
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:05,289
right I mean some would say that oh why

724
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:07,269
isn't it 90 percent right but what

725
00:29:05,289 --> 00:29:10,450
you're saying is that even though

726
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:11,980
somebody can purchase your class it

727
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:14,320
doesn't mean that they're studying it

728
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:15,820
the right way is that is that how it is

729
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,710
or is it that they're not starting off

730
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:19,830
with enough money

731
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:22,559
or is it I mean I'm sure it's a variety

732
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:24,450
of reasons yeah there's a lot of people

733
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,850
that they just had kids and the bottle

734
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:28,200
cords and having get into a burner

735
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:29,850
because I do live trading webinars to

736
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,159
people I've trade in front of them

737
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:36,299
and they don't even come to the webinars

738
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:37,919
yeah and that's how they failed quick

739
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:40,080
they wanted they bought it because they

740
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,210
wanted to make money quickly as opposed

741
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,519
to just wanting to study actually really

742
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:46,440
apply it yeah well a lot of people that

743
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:48,269
just come in well Stephen Hubbell just

744
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,249
give me your alerts and the William bio

745
00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:52,860
just buy the same thing with you you

746
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:55,110
can't do that because what happens and

747
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:56,009
when I just go off I just want to trip

748
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,990
I'm at home I don't want to teach

749
00:29:56,009 --> 00:30:00,299
anymore you're not self-sufficient and

750
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:02,940
it's not gonna help you it's the whole

751
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:04,169
like teacher man or give a man a fish he

752
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,820
eats for a day yeah

753
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:07,590
teach a man to fish he eats for his life

754
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:11,129
yeah and also I feel like they're lazy

755
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:12,539
the the fundamental of the program is I

756
00:30:11,129 --> 00:30:15,570
won't teach them to be self-sufficient

757
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:16,919
not being and to put in the work because

758
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:19,169
you did yeah you have to earn it you

759
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:21,480
can't just copy notes yeah yeah so

760
00:30:19,169 --> 00:30:25,289
essentially and then going back to kind

761
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:28,200
of I guess skeptics you I mean you

762
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:31,019
clearly make a ton of money daily yeah

763
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,399
why charge for these courses if the

764
00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:34,259
whole goal is to get these people to do

765
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,720
obviously I get it it's a business in

766
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:38,639
itself yeah is the goal to because this

767
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,369
business you think could be way bigger

768
00:30:38,639 --> 00:30:43,889
and it also helps people or is it like

769
00:30:41,369 --> 00:30:45,210
you know I mean it's kind of it's kind

770
00:30:43,889 --> 00:30:46,259
of strange to the average person like

771
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,399
you're making this much money why you

772
00:30:46,259 --> 00:30:49,350
need to charge why not just upload

773
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:51,240
YouTube videos yeah add you upload a lot

774
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:53,340
of YouTube videos for teaching people

775
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:56,610
and everything is free out there and

776
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:57,899
also the reason why I charge people is

777
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:59,490
that they want to feel something is

778
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:01,529
important when you buy something that's

779
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:04,860
super expensive you think is important

780
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:06,600
so that's why we just give stuff for

781
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:08,249
free they don't really care yeah yeah

782
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:11,460
yeah and they don't take it necessarily

783
00:31:08,249 --> 00:31:13,259
as seriously yeah true okay well we're

784
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,970
at our half time right now so we're

785
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:16,919
gonna take our quick shishi break and

786
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:19,320
we'll be right back all right or do you

787
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:21,690
have a special talent oh yeah we do that

788
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,220
now can you tell us a funny joke or can

789
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:25,169
you sing is there something do that

790
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,960
halftime show performance anything you

791
00:31:25,169 --> 00:31:29,220
want to do I'm really good at gaming but

792
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,180
yeah I guess we'll just cut to an hour

793
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,580
games

794
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:34,140
a live stream will come back we have

795
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:36,030
some personal questions for you as well

796
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:49,020
so I think it'll be a little interesting

797
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:52,260
yeah we'll be right back and we're back

798
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:54,240

803
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,780
talking about earlier about having proof

804
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:09,060
of your track record that most people

805
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:11,970
who give advice to basically do this

806
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:13,860
don't have yeah okay so this is a

807
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:15,720
website and you can call it your

808
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:20,460

00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:25,620
yeah so this is a mag well I don't want

811
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:28,380
to show my account number but this is my

812
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:30,000
account number and now the only thing

813
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,510
you need to pay attention to is you can

814
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,210
see right here

815
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:37,140
net profit right net P and else and

816
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:38,580
that's net profit and you can see on

817
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,620
this day made one hundred twenty one

818
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:43,200
hundred seventeen thousand this day lost

819
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:44,970
six thousand this day lost thirty five

820
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,670
thousand the study made twenty nine

821
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:49,110
thousand and overall forum for a month

822
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:50,910
and made about two hundred fifty five

823
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:52,290
thousand that's one month it's one month

824
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:53,940
yeah Wow

825
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:55,590
so the days you lose like 30-something

826
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:57,060
thousand you don't even that's not even

827
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:59,970
a drop in the bucket

828
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:01,470
yeah and it's its base as part of it

829
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:03,150
it's part of it so it's not like it's

830
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:05,700
like you made a good bet and get a bad

831
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:07,800
name if you ask any legitimate traders

832
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:10,500
you can't really win every single trade

833
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:12,090
right now possible so so that's why you

834
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,830
had to start off with twenty seven

835
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:15,900
thousand because without enough capital

836
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:19,590
well I mean I guess you could bet really

837
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:21,900
low right you can't ya because so I mean

838
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:26,480
in general what what let's say someone

839
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:30,090
only has a thousand dollars okay it's a

840
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:33,090
five hundred cuz he said number but you

841
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:35,670
are making and losing between what like

842
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:37,110
five and twenty dollars a day yes pretty

843
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:38,520
much like that and then you'd and that

844
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:41,550
was enough to get you like how did you

845
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:43,350
at what point did you take that was it

846
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,980
gradual gradual growth because that

847
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,960
seems like

848
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,299
- big leap in such a short amount of

849
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:50,130
time okay so when I was treating with

850
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:52,440
the $500 I was losing there and there

851
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:54,630
and once I got into the small cap market

852
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,220
and that was tracking statistics so

853
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:59,250
because I was an engineer everything is

854
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:00,720
based on statistics so that's why I use

855
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:02,400
the engineering method into the stock

856
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,350
market and they want to track this one

857
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,570
specific patterns

858
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:07,380
well how much well when I trade how much

859
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:09,690
money can I make

860
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:11,820
what's the percentage of reward so after

861
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:15,149
I check that was 20% and that attract

862
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:16,800
the winning percentage was 85% so each

863
00:34:15,149 --> 00:34:18,629
trade I have a eighty eighty-five

864
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,310
percent win chance and the twenty

865
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:22,919
percent of the world that can make

866
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:26,310
thousands of the same trade again again

867
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:27,840
and again then that's how I Verdi's put

868
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:29,399
more money so when you were just getting

869
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,540
started I mean assuming these people

870
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:31,560
that are taking your courses and they're

871
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,899
trying it for themselves

872
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,790
yeah they're not gonna be as good as you

873
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:38,310
in the beginning yes right so you have

874
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:40,830
to I mean I'm sure you've had a lot of

875
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:42,899
losses more so than now in the beginning

876
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:44,730
yes how were you able to convince

877
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:45,750
yourself like this is I'm doing the

878
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:47,639
right thing you know

879
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,840
okay when those losses were happening so

880
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:51,510
when the losses are happening a lot of

881
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:54,419
people so well as a human nature and

882
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:56,100
when people take a loss the instant

883
00:34:54,419 --> 00:35:00,119
reaction they will feel is I won't make

884
00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:01,200
this money back so yeah so I want to

885
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:05,730
make the money back they will make

886
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:08,700
emotional mistakes that's how casino

887
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:10,980
people lose money exactly yeah and now

888
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:13,350
the reason why you trade in stock market

889
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:16,470
because there's a wall there's a edge

890
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:18,630
for high only percentages 70 percent 80

891
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:20,600
percent even the sixty percent can still

892
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:23,790
make money in your honor wrong wrong and

893
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:27,150
when you are taking a loss in the single

894
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:30,060
into my mindset is so I track this

895
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:33,320
pattern and I do have 15 percent of

896
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:36,570
losing percentages and when I lose

897
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:38,040
also your mind I will know how much

898
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:40,200
money I can make per year because I know

899
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,450
the frequency of the pattern or

900
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,970
risk/reward of the pattern how many

901
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:46,650
times it happened per year and and I can

902
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:50,010
use that to simulate again it can make

903
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:51,330
about five million dollars a year and in

904
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:52,890
my mind I know I can make five million

905
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,940
dollars a year if I take a one loss it

906
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:56,730
doesn't really matter

907
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:58,680
is walk away and come back again so it's

908
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:59,970
more like a long-term it's more like a

909
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,680
long-term investment instead of like

910
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:05,369
looking at right right right

911
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:07,470
Wow how many different so like for

912
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:09,599
example yesterday how many different

913
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:11,789
companies are you trading are you

914
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:13,349
focusing on like one company or are you

915
00:36:11,789 --> 00:36:15,630
inputting like a bunch of money into it

916
00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:17,549
or are you kind of spreading out amongst

917
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:19,770
like a thousand companies and putting

918
00:36:17,549 --> 00:36:21,420
like a tiny bit in each one okay so this

919
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:22,740
is where you want to pick one stuff so

920
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,569
you want to trade and now typically when

921
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:26,280
I look at the market I want to look for

922
00:36:24,569 --> 00:36:28,049
everything that has volume that means

923
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:31,109
people are other people are looking at

924
00:36:28,049 --> 00:36:33,690
it as well so typically market opens at

925
00:36:31,109 --> 00:36:35,010
9:30 I wake up around 9:00 and just

926
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:37,619
generally take a look at the overall

927
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:40,200
market and what stock is hot so one

928
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:41,640
stock is up about or 50% already so a

929
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:44,400
lot of people will have eyes on it and

930
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,750
that's very generous volume that's the

931
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,140
stock that will pick the volume is the

932
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:51,079
amount of activity going on between

933
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:54,180
buyers and sellers yes mm-hmm

934
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:56,099
see so the higher the volume it means

935
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,480
that most people like a lot of people

936
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:59,369
are tricked there's a lot of activity

937
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,960
which means there's more potential for

938
00:36:59,369 --> 00:37:02,450
ups and downs

939
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,630
well it's and downs and that means

940
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:07,650
volatilities yeah so up and downs and

941
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:12,119
when you there's more people trading

942
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:14,430
there's more newbies Kim right because I

943
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:16,799
mean in general like and in a way you

944
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:18,089
can't really feel bad because those are

945
00:37:16,799 --> 00:37:20,190
the people who weren't willing to put in

946
00:37:18,089 --> 00:37:22,200
the time to study yeah and and really

947
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:24,089
there's those are the casual gamblers

948
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,619
like going to Vegas with money yeah

949
00:37:24,089 --> 00:37:27,900
they're not gonna play the odds they're

950
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:29,520
playing emotion yes yeah I guess I

951
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,230
understand that it's easier to because

952
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,279
you don't have to see their faces yeah

953
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:37,109
it's not like at the poker table yeah

954
00:37:34,279 --> 00:37:37,650
you know he has the money I was waiting

955
00:37:37,109 --> 00:37:40,170
you know

956
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:45,599
okay I understand that so you don't

957
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:47,039
trade like stable stable stocks yeah I

958
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,539
don't really trade staple stock I want

959
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:50,369
to trade something that can move 70

960
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:52,289
percent 100 percent thousand percent on

961
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:54,359
the day so the stable ones are the ones

962
00:37:52,289 --> 00:37:56,609
that are more for long-term would you

963
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:59,609
say the stable ones are yes for non term

964
00:37:56,609 --> 00:38:01,230
for swing trades or something index

965
00:37:59,609 --> 00:38:03,690
family what's a swing trade it's being

966
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:06,359
traded is you are holding four positions

967
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:07,770
for a couple month a year so even a

968
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:09,600
couple months you consider a long

969
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:11,430
from trade yeah instead consider no

970
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:14,880
because you do it what by the day I did

971
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:16,830
a yeah yeah so take us to your everyday

972
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,910
like you told us something early I don't

973
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:19,620
know if it was on the podcast or right

974
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:23,790
before but you work like two hours a day

975
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:26,280
yeah obviously in the beginning it was

976
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:28,770
all day yeah and for now at your level

977
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:31,410
and your success rate you wake up at

978
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:34,650
9:00 you can start at 9:30 you're done

979
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:37,260
by 11:30 yeah most actually and most of

980
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:40,230
the time just by 10:00 I want to stay

981
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:49,070
about 30 to 45 minutes and then what do

982
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:49,070

gamer Starcraft 2 David and I both used

988
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:08,820

990
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:16,830

995
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:32,250
lost in the road of 64 oh my gosh that's

996
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,660
still crazy I guess you know what when

997
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:35,040
you have that kind of money and then

998
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,480

00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,080
Starcraft so you buddy star crap every

1000
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:42,120
day yeah is this before or after you

1001
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,890
started this is before actually when I

1002
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,450
trying to develop the stock market

1003
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:47,910
strategies I used the sorceress

1004
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:50,460
strategies because it's more almost like

1005
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:52,080
same message same psychology counter

1006
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:54,960
strategies you want to counter people

1007
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:56,670
with that doing mistakes

1008
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,950
yeah making me say if you were going the

1009
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:00,990
meta which is like buying stock yes then

1010
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:08,940
you're going counter meta yeah so people

1011
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:12,960
are buying battlecruisers you're getting

1012
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:14,370
anti-air yeah your minds okay so okay so

1013
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,460
it's to you it was almost like common

1014
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:20,010
sense yeah okay interesting and you see

1015
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,930
something you can basically we never see

1016
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:23,119
a certain action

1017
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:25,160
you will know why they're building you

1018
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:28,400
can do you need to against it it's just

1019
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,640
very much a psychologist right right

1020
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,550
right

1021
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,260
you're interesting gaming doesn't just

1022
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:37,520
create gun violence

1023
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:40,040
it creates money so I have a question

1024
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,050
here so I you know a lot of people say

1025
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:45,500
they look up to you know the advice of

1026
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:47,599
Warren Buffett right yeah as a very

1027
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:49,490
successful trader mom you know something

1028
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,220
that I did read somewhere that Warren

1029
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:55,369
Buffett said is that if you you know

1030
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:57,319
take your paycheck and you take a

1031
00:40:55,369 --> 00:41:00,500
percentage of it and you invest it into

1032
00:40:57,319 --> 00:41:03,020
a fund or the sp500 it has a history of

1033
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:05,630
you know it's an uphill slope yes with

1034
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:06,890
some dips in between but from the very

1035
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:09,680
beginning of the stock market it's

1036
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:10,940
always been an upward trend yes so he

1037
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,890
was saying that you know if you put your

1038
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:15,500
money in there eventually you will make

1039
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:18,829
money and it'll compound and it'll make

1040
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:21,500
even more yeah and and so that's like a

1041
00:41:18,829 --> 00:41:23,240
long-term kind of mindset right yeah do

1042
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:25,480
you do you believe in I do believe it

1043
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:29,569
yes when you invest into us being from

1044
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:31,130
500 or going to in this index pounds you

1045
00:41:29,569 --> 00:41:32,599
do make money on long-term thank you

1046
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:35,599
five years ten years but you don't

1047
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:37,549
really make aggressive income and what

1048
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,349
percentage do does that generate you

1049
00:41:37,549 --> 00:41:41,540
would you say oh I don't really know 20

1050
00:41:39,349 --> 00:41:44,089
percent 50 percent maybe it'll be more

1051
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:46,280
than that she's pretty good over a long

1052
00:41:44,089 --> 00:41:49,040
period of time period of time but when

1053
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:52,040
you look at anything I trade twenty

1054
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:55,970
seven thousand into 1 million by already

1055
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:59,470
account statements that's that's that

1056
00:41:55,970 --> 00:42:02,720
presumably over 20 percent

1057
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:04,730
it's thousands of percent yeah right so

1058
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,970
I mean ever since so it's been about

1059
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:12,140
five years five six years of success

1060
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:13,579

1061
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:16,430

people who want something from you

1081
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:05,220
including girls yeah and she hasn't hit

1082
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:06,900
you up since she did once but oh yeah

1083
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:09,869
but that doesn't mean it was just for

1084
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:12,510
money could be but I mean how has it

1085
00:43:09,869 --> 00:43:14,400
changed your life I mean obviously I

1086
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:15,869
don't know I actually don't know how was

1087
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,220
your everyday life now that you work

1088
00:43:15,869 --> 00:43:19,529
those two hours that's not trying to get

1089
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:21,029
at what else other than gaming how does

1090
00:43:19,529 --> 00:43:23,670
it change your life really change

1091
00:43:21,029 --> 00:43:26,160
anything my life I love cars and they're

1092
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:28,260
just bought cars and nicer car once you

1093
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:31,319
try six-month and get tired of a generic

1094
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:34,980
honor I don't think your personality

1095
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:40,039
changes and they're losing you fly to LA

1096
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:44,099
30 times a year yes private jet

1097
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:47,210
sometimes no nope every day okay because

1098
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:51,150
Cincinnati doesn't have a private jet

1099
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:53,220
yeah okay well I mean like a like I said

1100
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:54,809
that might change cuz you're only at the

1101
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:56,819
four million more or five million mark

1102
00:43:54,809 --> 00:44:00,569
right who says in five years you won't

1103
00:43:56,819 --> 00:44:02,339
be what six exponent no what are you

1104
00:44:00,569 --> 00:44:03,660
projecting in five years I don't know

1105
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:05,130
because there's a synonym you can make

1106
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:07,650
on micro cap stocks

1107
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:09,569
you can't exceed 20 millions a year yeah

1108
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:11,670
so thinking about you think that at the

1109
00:44:09,569 --> 00:44:13,230
rate that you've been you know I don't

1110
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:15,180
know maybe it's consistent you hit a

1111
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:17,760
plateau where you get a million a year

1112
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:19,020
or has it been like twenty dollars then

1113
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,089
making a hundred dollars and then a

1114
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:23,549
thousand then then thirty thousand like

1115
00:44:21,089 --> 00:44:25,559
yeah what's your projection the

1116
00:44:23,549 --> 00:44:26,880
projection is I don't really you don't

1117
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:29,309
really want to do this forever

1118
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:33,089
you always want to like spray your

1119
00:44:29,309 --> 00:44:35,730
folios really stay which I just a couple

1120
00:44:33,089 --> 00:44:37,529
properties don't want to go and once you

1121
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:39,150
have all the proposals they all generate

1122
00:44:37,529 --> 00:44:42,660
any money and so on and and these

1123
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:43,890
courses - it's a business in itself get

1124
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:45,750
enough people then you don't even need

1125
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:46,890
to do this and the reason why I start

1126
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:49,500
courses is

1127
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:51,570
you guys all know packing like a year

1128
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:53,580
ago through a year ago lot of people are

1129
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:55,740
starting lifestyle marketing I don't

1130
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:58,620
know if you guys notice courses yeah are

1131
00:44:55,740 --> 00:45:01,350
showing you houses but there's like that

1132
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:04,050
one guy on YouTube Tai Lopez yeah yeah

1133
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:06,690
yeah it's all my stuff marking where is

1134
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:08,760
the track record and why do dad show us

1135
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:10,890
the track record well I mean I think a

1136
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,650
lot of those I never I was just annoyed

1137
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:16,260
by those ads I just be like this guy is

1138
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:17,100
such a douchebag anyway I would look at

1139
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,720
that I don't feel like it would get

1140
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:21,840
people's attention you're right but then

1141
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:23,580
but then are they legitimate they might

1142
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:25,200
be don't know yeah you don't know but

1143
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:30,090
but you're going the route of like

1144
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:31,980
here's transparency yeah and I'm sure

1145
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:33,180
there's gonna be people who the people

1146
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:35,160
who are mad at you who are gonna speak

1147
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:37,530
out against you yeah but if you have the

1148
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:39,240
proof you have the receipts then I mean

1149
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:40,800
there's nothing you can really say and I

1150
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:43,140
think that's important to be transparent

1151
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,820
I think it's very important yeah okay I

1152
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,470
think it's one of the most important

1153
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:48,090
yeah before you start teaching people

1154
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:49,410
because if you don't know what you're

1155
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:53,030
teaching then you're teaching that run

1156
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:53,030
the wrong thing and a lot of people

1157
00:45:53,870 --> 00:46:00,270
that's not right yeah right okay I mean

1158
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,440
do you so you do you enjoy the teaching

1159
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:05,160
process would you say you're a better

1160
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:07,320
teacher or a better try see my cuz when

1161
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,570
I teach people because I attract a lot

1162
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:12,860
of more younger generations so a lot of

1163
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:15,780
people are gamers and funny people and

1164
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:17,730
we have our own common languages so it's

1165
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:19,470
actually yeah it's a do you enjoy

1166
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:22,620
teaching yeah and then you feel

1167
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:24,300
obviously so how exactly just to give

1168
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:28,350
you a rough estimate how much are these

1169
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:30,330
courses some of the courses or if

1170
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:33,780
they're super beginners to start yeah to

1171
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:35,280
start like $90 come on okay so it's a

1172
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:36,540
good subscription service yeah like

1173
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,550
anything else like almost like going to

1174
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:40,950
I mean I guess a really cheap college

1175
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:42,660
yeah not considering not calling what

1176
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:44,700
you do a college but that's kind of what

1177
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:47,940
it is is you're taking a school right it

1178
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:50,520
depends on how what I well how deep you

1179
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:53,160
want to go of course is I mean but do

1180
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:54,360
you think I mean how many courses are

1181
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,310
there like do you think you have to

1182
00:46:54,360 --> 00:47:00,040
finish it to get to where you're at

1183
00:46:56,310 --> 00:47:03,130
yeah I would say

1184
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:05,170
there's about well it's not how many

1185
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:08,020
courses is about how many live webinars

1186
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:10,030
and I do and you watch me trade I can

1187
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:15,070
pretty much do the same thing I'm not

1188
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:17,620
there looking up in the morning and make

1189
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:21,580
sure execution goes good and doing your

1190
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:24,220
own statistics it's the method I see

1191
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:27,190
it's like learning how to do it yeah and

1192
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:29,560
you have a lot of videos online you said

1193
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:32,020
right yeah so what differentiates that

1194
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:33,580
from the classes like what makes

1195
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:35,560
somebody go you know I think I should

1196
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:37,780
take the classes because these videos

1197
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:43,470
can only offer so much or is it is like

1198
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:46,720
a way more intense dense because I so

1199
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:48,580
YouTube videos are more general

1200
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,780
beginners for people that just want to

1201
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:52,840
get in the market and they don't know

1202
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:55,540
what even stock market is and you can

1203
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:56,830
listen some general opinions and what

1204
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,660
should you or should not do

1205
00:47:56,830 --> 00:48:00,310
find your voice on beginning mistakes

1206
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:02,290
there and there but if you really want

1207
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:05,050
to get into pattern statistics and real

1208
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:07,990
convince courses that just teach you the

1209
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:10,810
patterns then yeah I'm saying that's

1210
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:13,330
where the paid courses come again yeah I

1211
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:16,120
really wish we had you here at 9:30 so

1212
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:19,360
we got a watch to just do it yeah howdy

1213
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:20,980
here right before after yeah I wish I

1214
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,820
would have just seen it just to be like

1215
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:23,200
oh okay

1216
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:24,610
it's like that not that I would

1217
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,800
understand how to do it just as like

1218
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:28,540
visually just see you do it yeah and

1219
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:32,380
then be like okay let's do the podcast I

1220
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:33,760
just made 30 grand so cool would you say

1221
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:36,100
that a majority of your income comes

1222
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,860
from trading versus like your your other

1223
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:40,810
business with the teaching trading

1224
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:50,170
accountant of trading makes more money

1225
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:53,860
and compared what percentage probably 70

1226
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:56,860
percent 80 percent yeah mm-hmm it's not

1227
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:58,030
the service is not started to I want to

1228
00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:00,040
make money from people

1229
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:02,290
yeah yeah it's not dedicated in that

1230
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:03,880
yeah but I mean eventually I mean if

1231
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:06,490
you're putting in the time to build it

1232
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:08,140
out and and run it yeah you have to

1233
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:08,800
there has to be some read it's not a

1234
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:11,050
charity

1235
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,880
yeah right so I mean it makes sense it's

1236
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:14,260
a business at the same time earlier he

1237
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,600
said he wants like when you pay for

1238
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:18,670
something now give it worth so that's

1239
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:22,960
what it's true yeah true that's mainly

1240
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:24,250
what it's for yeah yeah yeah well I mean

1241
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:27,490
that's interesting we have some

1242
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:29,440
questions from fans okay you mind

1243
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:31,450
answering here we have one from Ji Young

1244
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,460
here when do you believe the next

1245
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:35,170
financial downturn will happen and

1246
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:36,610
should we wait to begin investing until

1247
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:38,350
that happens kind of like what I guess

1248
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:39,970
Warren Buffett does right yes but when

1249
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:43,540
it was really cheap and then yeah

1250
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:45,070
so there's because when I trade while

1251
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:46,960
micro cap stocks they don't have any

1252
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:48,850
correlations being on well compared to

1253
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,110
the entire market so when the market

1254
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:52,180
goes down we rub it doesn't really

1255
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:54,640
affect this affect the stock what I'm

1256
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:57,880
trading so that's something that you can

1257
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:59,710
be really safe to learn to trade and

1258
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:01,690
also you can learn how to really trade

1259
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:03,460
in on terms so financial process happens

1260
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:05,560
every 10 years so we're at that mark

1261
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:08,470
consistently consistently yeah okay so

1262
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:10,690
it's coming soon soon yeah so I mean but

1263
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:11,830
in your it's almost the opposite for you

1264
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:15,010
right all right correct me if I'm wrong

1265
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:17,290
but you're waiting to people over invest

1266
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:19,300
and then you short right you don't go

1267
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:21,070
against that yeah so you're not waiting

1268
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:22,900
till it's well I guess it would be at

1269
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:25,390
the same time right when the market is

1270
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:27,250
bad then more people invest is that how

1271
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:29,260
it works okay let me give you examples

1272
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:31,930
it's very easy to understand okay and

1273
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:34,030
okay let's start from the beginning so

1274
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:36,910
when it stopped when this stock is going

1275
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:38,560
up the first time and a lot of people

1276
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:41,020
are telling your friends okay well

1277
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:44,350
invest in stock the stock went from it's

1278
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:48,280
the new Tesla and stock went from 1 to

1279
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:50,860
10 and you tracked a lot of people to

1280
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:52,750
invest the stock now well the company

1281
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:57,460
didn't do that gun stock went from 10 to

1282
00:50:52,750 --> 00:51:00,130
1 and all of your stuck at 10 so the

1283
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:02,470
next time with stock bounces to 10 go

1284
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:04,810
spectacles to 10 again after 2 years you

1285
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:06,250
guys are tired of holding and the stock

1286
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:07,870
goes back to 10 I was short a because

1287
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:09,520
you guys will sell you guys don't want

1288
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:11,350
to hold out that's one more pattern that

1289
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,670
you've recognized but when I'm shorting

1290
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:14,680
it there's still people buying at 10

1291
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:16,990
because they think always gonna be

1292
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:19,750
potentially break through 10 and that

1293
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:20,980
time we trap will trap new people into

1294
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:22,720
at 10 right

1295
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:24,670
and when stock goes against the time

1296
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,720
again will cause a certain chain

1297
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:28,390
reactions will

1298
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:29,890
keep coughing are you like coughing is

1299
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:32,200
it very rare that you're wrong about

1300
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:34,150
that like let's say something it is the

1301
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:35,950
next Tesla lately it yeah like how often

1302
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:38,800
does that happen to you one not a 50

1303
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:40,570
very rare yeah so we're betting the

1304
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,610
percentages so this kind of happened

1305
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:43,780
with Bitcoin right wait what's your idea

1306
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:46,000
like we remember when there was such a

1307
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:48,520
big I mean I'm sure you know it was such

1308
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,100
a big thing we crypto right yes it was

1309
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:53,110
at I think our friends were like oh it

1310
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:55,240
was at well I don't remember them didn't

1311
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:57,580
20 he was really yeah but it was like a

1312
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:59,590
10 when I was super popular and then it

1313
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:01,300
went up to 20 yeah and people were still

1314
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:03,580
buying along the way even our friends

1315
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:04,690
were buying her on like 10 went up to 20

1316
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,890
and they were still holding on to it and

1317
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:07,600
people were saying it's gonna come back

1318
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:08,740
down it kind of did it did I was

1319
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:11,440
shooting it but okay

1320
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:13,930
yeah so you you I was being part of it

1321
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,490
yeah yeah it's same thing and so what if

1322
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:17,410
though and people still believe we have

1323
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:20,740
friends who still say bitcoins gonna be

1324
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:22,330
the future what if it just keeps I guess

1325
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:25,030
a it's just a pattern thing like you're

1326
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:26,620
assuming it's never gonna come I'm not

1327
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:28,210
assuming it's never gonna become big but

1328
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:31,990
I think about like this so at that time

1329
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:34,330
back in 20 I think it was 2017 yeah so

1330
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:37,000
the big one when there's a huge hype

1331
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:38,860
about it and understand the industry of

1332
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,540
pretty much everything 90% people do

1333
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:41,770
this morning so when 90 people for some

1334
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:43,270
people trying to buy something you're

1335
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:46,060
trying to be cool against it so that's

1336
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:48,100
how you make money I see now since since

1337
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:50,080
it was a huge hype and there's more

1338
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:53,500
people are trapped in it so a lot of

1339
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:55,540
people holding 15,000 16,000 17,000 even

1340
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:57,790
though 20,000 when that goes back to

1341
00:52:55,540 --> 00:53:00,670
20,000 again other people will sell it's

1342
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:02,500
the same psychology right so first to

1343
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:05,080
recover from that many back holders

1344
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:07,300
which people are holding the bag we

1345
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:09,190
don't looking to sell I will take years

1346
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:11,800
and years so for the next couple of

1347
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:14,530
years the investor will be fighting the

1348
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:16,720
pack holders for a while so you right

1349
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:19,270
before this you mentioned breaking ten

1350
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:21,700
so are you saying breaking 10 because 10

1351
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:25,900
is a whole like a good number like a 1 0

1352
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:27,580
and then like 2015 or yeah so the first

1353
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:28,960
time when stock arel I'm not gonna short

1354
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:30,400
it because I want to know where the bag

1355
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,400
holder is I want to know where to start

1356
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:35,410
drops once they trap enough back holders

1357
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:37,780
everyone know or at this price before

1358
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:39,400
looking to sell and we go stop rise and

1359
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:41,410
short sell it

1360
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:43,359
and people when they're people well when

1361
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:45,130
people are trying to buy it at ten there

1362
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:46,539
will be new people traveling again so

1363
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:48,730
will cause a chain reaction next time

1364
00:53:46,539 --> 00:53:51,640
when people trying to buy again I was

1365
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:53,770
still short selling and then mm-hmm do

1366
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:56,980
it again and again again no always make

1367
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:58,569
money mm-hmm until the day I'm

1368
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:01,299
theoretically on to the day that it just

1369
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:02,829
keeps but blows up until the day that we

1370
00:54:01,299 --> 00:54:05,319
were saying even then it should come

1371
00:54:02,829 --> 00:54:07,390
back down well until the day breaks ten

1372
00:54:05,319 --> 00:54:09,339
yeah then now we'll cut at ten fifty

1373
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:14,109
then we just lose fifty cents out of ten

1374
00:54:09,339 --> 00:54:16,089
dollars talk I see right oh I see okay

1375
00:54:14,109 --> 00:54:17,410
there is me so I'm just trying to follow

1376
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:20,349
everything in my head yeah it's like

1377
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:23,140
yeah it's such a new concept right I saw

1378
00:54:20,349 --> 00:54:24,640
you nothing about stocks I think if I

1379
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:27,490
can under I kind of understand but I

1380
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:28,869
think if I can kind of understand I

1381
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:32,950
think a lot of people listening will

1382
00:54:28,869 --> 00:54:34,510
know a lot more know people say that a

1383
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:36,849
lot you know he did like the one with

1384
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:41,710
Andrea I was like what does he not know

1385
00:54:36,849 --> 00:54:43,029
anything on this show yes we I need

1386
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:44,680
things dumbed down but I did a great job

1387
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:46,240
I think I understand this a lot more and

1388
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:49,839
I think I appreciate the fact that

1389
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:52,029
you're being very transparent even

1390
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:53,559
though as a skeptic person myself I

1391
00:54:52,029 --> 00:54:55,180
would personally be like well how do I

1392
00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:57,250
know what I'm looking at because this is

1393
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:59,109
confusing and we're taking it from your

1394
00:54:57,250 --> 00:55:01,750
words so if I had somebody verify that

1395
00:54:59,109 --> 00:55:03,279
doesn't know you been like oh yeah this

1396
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:06,010
is legit I would probably believe it

1397
00:55:03,279 --> 00:55:08,470
more but I'm not I'm not questioning it

1398
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:09,880
I'm yeah and I've met you now and you

1399
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:13,500
seem like a very straight up dude and

1400
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:15,579
you play Starcraft 2 so that helps

1401
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:18,160
there's like a certain connection there

1402
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:20,109
and I I don't know I think it's it's

1403
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:23,890
definitely interesting and it seems like

1404
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:25,569
you genuinely want to help yeah and yeah

1405
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:27,220
I mean if you're gonna I wouldn't

1406
00:55:25,569 --> 00:55:30,069
personally I don't know enough to

1407
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:32,950
encourage anyone but I think if you're

1408
00:55:30,069 --> 00:55:37,569
interested we can find Steven where can

1409
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:41,910
they steven duck sitcom so d Steven Dux

1410
00:55:37,569 --> 00:55:46,029
i com QX I okay yeah Steven ducks EECOM

1411
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:48,599
okay cool um did we miss anything well I

1412
00:55:46,029 --> 00:55:50,230
mean we do have a couple more oh yeah

1413
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:53,440
questions

1414
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:55,420
yeah so Eric Wynn has a question and

1415
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,770
it's like if you gotta be combined with

1416
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:59,260
a lot of other things too but it's just

1417
00:55:56,770 --> 00:56:01,750
like I have a 9 to 5 job that requires

1418
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:03,340
me to have my full 8-hour attention but

1419
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:06,700
I really want to trade and make a profit

1420
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:09,040
yeah do I have to trade hourly / daily

1421
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:11,890
in order to be successful okay so

1422
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:14,140
there's two strategies I'm teaching why

1423
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:16,210
you can be a full-time day trader one

1424
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:17,619
thing can be a part-time day trader but

1425
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:19,690
right now I'm leaving on part-time

1426
00:56:17,619 --> 00:56:22,060
because I only stay about 45 minutes so

1427
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:25,090
as long as you can all take your time

1428
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:27,040
and wake up at 9:00 try it until 10:00

1429
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:29,470
then you're good just what is it every

1430
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:31,240
day it's pretty much every day is there

1431
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:34,450
a way you could do like does it or does

1432
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:35,890
it just not work this way that you do

1433
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:38,830
follow your stress is your strategy

1434
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:41,710
based on you have to be there every day

1435
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:45,130
a strategy is based on you have to be at

1436
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:47,290
least 30 minutes every day every day

1437
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:49,359
what if you did like a week straight and

1438
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:51,130
then you skipped a couple days and then

1439
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:53,109
you win another you can still skip yeah

1440
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:55,690
so you can you can't skip Camus a day

1441
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:58,390
that doesn't ruin your strategy oh no

1442
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:59,619
okay well what about whatever at like

1443
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:00,940
the beginning though you know when

1444
00:56:59,619 --> 00:57:02,590
they're just starting to learn because

1445
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:05,380
some people aren't gonna be able to just

1446
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:07,869
you know do what you did and or aren't

1447
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:09,070
brave enough to necessarily just give up

1448
00:57:07,869 --> 00:57:10,869
what they're doing and commit to this

1449
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:12,580
full-time right yes so if you're not

1450
00:57:10,869 --> 00:57:13,750
really committed to this beginning I

1451
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:16,990
don't really recommend people to

1452
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:18,820
recommit time for to learn these

1453
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:21,640
strategies to learn the industries you

1454
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:24,850
need a year of learning repetition yeah

1455
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:27,670
for actually trading just 30 minutes to

1456
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:29,350
45 yeah what about people who aren't I

1457
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:30,550
mean a lot of this seems like pattern

1458
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:32,410
recognition is pattern recognition

1459
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:33,880
something you can learn or is there

1460
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:35,560
something like it's it's like math where

1461
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:37,150
you can learn the formula you can learn

1462
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:38,680
the formula okay so it is like a math

1463
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:39,940
it's like it's not like writing we're

1464
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:42,130
like you have some people are creative

1465
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:47,170
and some people just there's an answer

1466
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:49,990
it's 80% math 20% I'll say sick ha

1467
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:52,500
judgment judgments okay yeah in the

1468
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:58,030
psychology part refers more so to

1469
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:59,560
whether that day you want to like you

1470
00:57:58,030 --> 00:58:01,180
feels more selfish

1471
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:02,710
yeah sometimes you feel more greedy

1472
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:03,770
sometimes you want to make more money in

1473
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:04,820
sometimes well if you

1474
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:06,530
take a loss you want to make you back

1475
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:10,070
here so it's it's more about discipline

1476
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:11,990
right so that's what you were saying

1477
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:14,090
about like people make emotional

1478
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:18,920
decisions and your whole thing is don't

1479
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:21,200
do that don't do your robot that's

1480
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:22,520
that's definitely um interesting do you

1481
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,740
wanna go through the list of us we got

1482
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:26,360
one last one from Adi Chon do what

1483
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:28,790
advice do you have for high schoolers

1484
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:30,290
that want to start investing okay so for

1485
00:58:28,790 --> 00:58:33,650
high schoolers I don't think you can

1486
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:38,420
open up a brokerage account before you

1487
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:41,480
turn 21 but when I was 19 I I think I

1488
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:43,280
yeah when you turn 18 you can open it up

1489
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:44,660
approach broker check account but you

1490
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,190
can't really have a margin account

1491
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:47,870
what's a brokerage account a brokerage

1492
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:49,940
account just have an account you need

1493
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:52,070
trade and okay it's just like to get in

1494
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:55,820
like the program your unit is due to

1495
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:57,560
open up you have to be 21 to 18 18 and

1496
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:58,850
you need to when you turn 21 can have a

1497
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:00,320
margin account which means you have a

1498
00:58:58,850 --> 00:59:03,170
leverage you can borrow money in from

1499
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:04,940
the brokerage I don't know which allows

1500
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:06,830
you to short which allows you to short

1501
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:08,210
okay so okay but you're not borrowing

1502
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:09,380
from nothing you're borrowing from the

1503
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:12,140
money that you've already put in the

1504
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:14,030
yeah yeah so you can't short until your

1505
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:14,510
until you have that margin account

1506
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:17,030
account

1507
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:19,940
yes uni that's your strategy restaurants

1508
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:25,850
but you can use your parents do count

1509
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:29,380
