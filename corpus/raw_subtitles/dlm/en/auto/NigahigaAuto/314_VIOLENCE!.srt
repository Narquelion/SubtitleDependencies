00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,030
hey guys services are posted by

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,350
censorship video I've been getting a lot

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,910
of comments from parents or people

4
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,350
pretending to be parents saying things

5
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,490
like my son started cursing and became

6
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,230
violent after watching your videos

7
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,790
delete all your videos immediately first

8
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,799
off don't believe your child's cursing

9
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,379
on me I don't even curse in my videos I

10
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,119
keep this PG ok yes sometimes there are

11
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,199
little bits of violence in my video but

12
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,670
really you're gonna blame your child's

13
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,109
behavior on what they watch and not by

14
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,580
your parenting I grew up watching shows

15
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:25,199
like Tom and Jerry where it's all about

16
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,460
a cat trying to murder a mouse and you

17
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,900
don't see me choosing any one around

18
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,460
with a knife I had the entire first

19
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,250
season of Dragon Balls here my part of

20
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,230
those still be little 9000 is to watch

21
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,670
and play pokemon religiously that's all

22
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,050
about getting a pet making it stronger

23
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,250
so that you can kill other people's pets

24
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,600
and I'm nothing like Michael Bay because

25
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,219
people aren't violent due to what they

26
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,300
watch their violence of who they are and

27
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,410
how they were raised violence is

28
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,910
everywhere in entertainment and it

29
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,200
always will be because people find it to

30
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,430
be entertaining could you imagine what

31
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,780

62
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:24,900
you're wrong

63
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:26,400
I'll just Sparkle although I think

64
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,540
people should never use my eyes to solve

65
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,070
their problems I don't think you should

66
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,239
blame entertainment for it and people

67
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,860
think that kids are so impressionable

68
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,180
and should be hidden from violence so

69
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,500
why do we force them to go to school and

70
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,700
take history class where they learn all

71
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,380
about the wars that happen in the past

72
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,120
wars like the most violent thing in the

73
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,800
world I don't support violence and I

74
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,209
would never instigate it if I really

75
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,560
were that evil and I wanted to start

76
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:44,940
buying clothes would have to say is who

77
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,530
is better one direction or Justin Bieber

78
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,850
you would see tons of violent comments

79
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,530
in the comments section below I would

80
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,970
never do that especially not at the end

81
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,280
of a video ones still fresh in their

82
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:55,640
minds because that that would just be

83
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,640
sick
