the line so you can't make any more

121

funds if you say so yes I do but just so

122
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:49,300
I'm clear this line represents the last

123
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,849
part of the video right yeah so

124
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,409
technically then this line is kind of

125
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:57,520
like the line that I'm seeing right now

126
00:07:53,409 --> 00:08:04,270
