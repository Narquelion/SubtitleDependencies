1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
first off sorry I didn't post the video

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,730
last week I was actually in Australia

3
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,109
and Singapore for a couple weeks but

4
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,730
anyway I haven't done a rant in a very

5
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:09,870
long time I mean like a legit ran from

6
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,420
back in the day where I would just turn

7
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,250
on the camera wake up try to figure out

8
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,570
how I turned on the camera before waking

9
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:21,210
up you know what I mean just ranting in

10
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:24,689
one spot with no cutaways but I didn't

11
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:28,289
say anything about Tara ways hey bad

12
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:30,029
joke not a good start so back to the

13
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,529
topic last time in a rant about Justin

14
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:32,880
Bieber called Bieber fever you was the

15
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:33,870
biggest thing in entertainment surely

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,370
that should tell you how long ago that

17
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,140
was as I was basically talking about

18
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,730
this innocent humble 16 year old

19
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,290
heartthrob however four years later you

20
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,360
say Justin Bieber and you definitely

21
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,980
don't think innocent humble 16 year old

22
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,180
heartthrob any more anyway even if you

23
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,039
couldn't care less about Justin Bieber

24
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,390
we all know who he is and how he's been

25
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,789
getting into a lot of trouble from

26
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,350
vandalism to drugs and most recently a

27
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:53,730
little racism and for those of you that

28
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,050
might not know about a week ago there

29
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,610
was a video about Justin Bieber making a

30
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,590
black joke where he says the n-word and

31
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,629
pretty much everyone called him a racist

32
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,949
and obviously he publicly apologized for

33
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:03,840
it but then a few days later on another

34
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:05,430
video leads of him making another racist

35
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,659
comment this time in soft form if you

36
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,369
haven't seen that video it's basically

37
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,560
15 year old Justin Bieber singing in

38
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:12,479
song one less lonely girl and instead of

39
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,680
girl uses the n-word and sings it over

40
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,909
and over and just when you think it

41
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,500
couldn't get any worse he brings up the

42
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,180
KKK and if that first video wasn't

43
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,500
enough after the second one everyone is

44
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,970
calling him a racist he's been caught

45
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,799
with drugs doing so many other stupid

46
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,540
things and now this I could easily pick

47
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,680
the safe route and talk about how unfit

48
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,030
he is to be a role model because

49
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,470
honestly I agree with that he should not

50
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,670
be a role model for kids but that would

51
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,140
be boring because everyone else is doing

52
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,250
that right now or they're going to be

53
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,990
for the next couple of weeks so if the

54
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,280
question is if Justin Bieber is racist I

55
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,960
can honestly say that I see both sides

56
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,640
and I'm about to give you the side

57
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,079
that's probably a little more unpopular

58
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,250
like I said I still don't think Justin

59
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,630
Bieber should be a role model for kids

60
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,860
not because he does drugs or does other

61
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,329
stupid things it's because he gets

62
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,590
caught doing this he can take all the

63
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:48,030
drugs and do all the stupid thing he

64
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,020
wants it's his life but he has so many

65
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,759
kids looking up to him he has a

66
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,110
responsibility to not let those things

67
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,220
get out but that's just my opinion

68
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,630
and now because of those two leaked

69
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,979
videos everybody and their mothers are

70
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,600
saying that Justin Bieber is a racist

71
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,950
and personally I really don't think he

72
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,299
is I'm sure a lot of other people would

73
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,290
agree with me too but they don't want to

74
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,399
say it because they don't want to sound

75
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,869
racist let me tell you why

76
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,579
both of these videos are of Justin

77
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:07,350
Bieber when he was 14 or 15 years old

78
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,670
and as a teenager everybody says and

79
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,869
does stupid things I mean if you're in

80
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,580
your 20s and you can still see your

81
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:11,970
myspace I bet if you went back and read

82
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,770
it you

83
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,940
see how stupid you are you say things or

84
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,260
write things that you would never do now

85
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,520
and if you're a teenager now you might

86
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,930
think that the things you're saying and

87
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,460
doing aren't stupid now but check your

88
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,540
Facebook in five to ten years and I'm

89
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,770
pretty sure you're gonna think otherwise

90
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,030
and I know a lot of people are gonna say

91
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,590
that him being a kin at the time doesn't

92
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,970
make it any less racist I agree he

93
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,200
doesn't he said the n-word and some

94
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,060
pretty racist things that got out to the

95
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,230
public but like I said everyone does and

96
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,640
says regrettable things when they're

97
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,960
kids and even if you don't excuse him

98
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,670
for his age and you still think he's a

99
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,170
racist as bad as it may sound it was

100
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,430
clearly not serious about what he was

101
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,900
saying I mean in the first video he was

102
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,340
literally making the joke jokes aren't

103
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,960
meant to be serious if you were black or

104
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,400
a stand-up comedian that wasn't like and

105
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,900
he said what he said people would just

106
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,459
let that slide it's just because he's

107
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,959
Justin Bieber a lot of people don't like

108
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,400
him so he's instantly a racist in the

109
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,620
first video he was literally making a

110
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,150
joke it was a racist joke but still it

111
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,380
wasn't serious the second video is a

112
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,940
little edgier but it's still pretty

113
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,530
obvious that he was joking I mean he's

114
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,910
spoofing his own song while other people

115
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,110
are laughing with him it literally

116
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,730
looked like a video of a bunch of

117
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,500
friends goofing off together hanging out

118
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,940
in a room privately I'm sure he never

119
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,230
meant that video to be seen or heard

120
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,820
ever just like the Donald sterling

121
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,380
situation which brings up a good point

122
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,850
there's a big difference between the

123
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,080
Justin Bieber situation and Donald

124
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,700
sterling so yeah I do believe that

125
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,050
Donald sterling is a racist because in

126
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,610
his recording he says some things that

127
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,959
were clearly serious and not meant to be

128
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,400
a joke or make people laugh but the

129
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,050
thing that makes him racist is that he

130
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,030
actually sees other ethnicities as

131
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,830
inferior to his own and he acts upon it

132
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,300
see that's a real racist Justin Bieber

133
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,830
just said some racist things to make

134
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,480
people laugh sure call him an idiot but

135
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,680
he's not a racist there's no evidence of

136
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,209
him treating people differently because

137
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,580
of race even if sometimes he acts like

138
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:37,500
an ask to fans or flight attendant so

139
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,840
Seth Rogen's because they're black he's

140
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,400
an ass to everyone equally he's an equal

141
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,810
ass I mean look at his Instagram he has

142
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,130
black friends I'm pretty sure if he

143
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,540
didn't like black people he would not be

144
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,950
friends with them so overall to wrap up

145
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,209
no I do not think Justin Bieber should

146
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,400
be a role model for kids and in no way

147
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:51,600
am i defending him but he's not racist I

148
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,799
guess that is kind of different in him

149
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,120
but I'm not defending him because I'm a

150
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,470
believer I just don't think it's right

151
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,580
to be calling someone racist when

152
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,049
they're not College I'm gonna race this

153
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,519
is a big deal in this day and age and

154
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:00,870
you can't label someone a racist just

155
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,220
because of a couple of jokes they made

156
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,570
back when they were a kid I mean if you

157
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,739
can honestly say that you've never said

158
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,269
something as a kid that you wish you

159
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:07,950
didn't say and if you never repeated a

160
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:09,120
black joke or any racist joke that you

161
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,830
heard to a bunch of family and friends

162
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,299
in a private location thinking no one

163
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,010
else would hear it congratulations you

164
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:15,330
literally might be the best person in

165
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,680
the world the best person that I know at

166
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,060
least you should be the next justin

167
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,769
bieber the president the pole because

168
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,120
you're pretty damn close to perfect and

169
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:22,440
people should be following a role model

170
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,650
like you but then again if you really do

171
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,669
believe that you haven't done

172
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,530
wrong in your life and you think people

173
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:28,150
should follow what you do it's pretty

174
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,500
cocky of you to think that and now I

175
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,639
hate you see how that works and I'm

176
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,930
gonna say it again just because this

177
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,220
videos based on racism and I already

178
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,199
know the comments my last name is

179
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,090
Okinawan so it's pronounced Higa not

180
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,169
Higa so it's pronounced nigahiga if

181
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,250
you're interpreting it the other way

182
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:41,169
that's because you're reading it wrong

183
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,520
and that would make you a little racist

184
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:43,900
but anyway thank you guys so much for

185
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,039
watching like I said this was my first

186
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,360
friend in a long time without any

187
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:47,919
cutaways though I did have a lot of

188
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,780
urges to do so especially on that one

189
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,880
part of the video where I said we don't

190
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:55,389
edits couldn't pass to everyone equally

191
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:58,479

192
00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:59,860

193
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,479

194
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,919

195
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:05,229
