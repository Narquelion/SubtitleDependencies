oh it was okay what was that spot

38
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:10,880
super-good yeah then why I don't think

39
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:13,790
we should do yet I literally live above

40
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:16,610

42
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,120
okay well fine but I will say though

43
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:23,470
that they have a burger where they put a

44
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:26,660
slice of flaming yon in the burger Oh

45
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,950
like on top of the regular patty I could

46
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,510
give him more I know

47
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:32,120
just keep give him more hands what is a

48
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:34,310
street name rhyme way so we can find

49
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:39,620
this burger spot not your place you know

50
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:41,690
this burgers but I don't even know okay

51
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,220
Google Maps tells me where to go and

52
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:45,500
I'll just go alright you someone who

53
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:48,770
uses Google Maps or ways actually Oh

54
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:52,880
Google Maps for sure well yeah cuz I

55
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:55,570
mean like the UI on Waze is the grossest

56
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:58,700
thing I've ever seen you're a infection

57
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:01,460
yeah oh yeah come on man actually what

58
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:03,440
is UI I don't know user interface got it

59
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:05,690
so mark it's just it just looks really

60
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,430
ugly and there's a lot of like logos and

61
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:09,980
stuff and I've never I've never actually

62
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:12,740
used it ever I've seen other people use

63
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:16,120
it and so you're gonna call it ugly and

64
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:19,760
never use it you know I am one of those

65
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,530
but also they they make some pretty

66
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,570
crazy recommendations like they'll have

67
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,420
you do a left turn across like six lanes

68
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:29,480
of traffic and I mean yeah you can do

69
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:31,040
that but I get crazy anxiety over that

70
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,200
kind of stuff because I don't want to I

71
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,820
don't want to edge out and then block

72
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,830
other people because I don't want to

73
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,810
inconvenience other people so I I'm

74
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:42,470
always trying to be as like considerate

75
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:44,750
described especially for an LA driver I

76
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:47,150
know it's not a good pairing I always

77
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:49,880
say though that la drivers although they

78
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,530
you know have a reputation to be very

79
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,450
aggressive and whatnot they're one of

80
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:56,540
the you got to be a really good driver

81
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:58,250
in LA yet right yeah I think that that's

82
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,920
the strange thing about LA is they breed

83
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:03,680
really good drivers like not nice

84
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,690
drivers know they it's arrogant they're

85
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,550
arrogant drivers because they they see a

86
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:09,500
space that the car can fit into in

87
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:12,140
traffic and I'm just gonna wedge right

88
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,360
in there and yeah your car can fit there

89
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:17,690
but you could also cause somebody to

90
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,010
freak out and crash into you but it's

91
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,979
really funny whenever I go back to

92
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:24,350
Sacramento because the difference in

93
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:24,800
drivers of LA and Sacramento while still

94
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:28,250
in Cal

95
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,800
for Nia is night and day because people

96
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:33,620
in Sacramento are nice but also

97
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,940
completely clueless like whenever I go

98
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,500
up there I always find somebody that's

99
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,599
just not looking they just start merging

100
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:43,069
into my lane I'm like hey hey

101
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:46,699
so yeah la is not Ellie's not that bad

102
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:48,349
see in Hilo in Hawaii we don't even have

103
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:49,940
that many lanes so you don't have to

104
00:04:48,349 --> 00:04:51,830
worry about that but people also don't

105
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,229
drive over I would say forty miles an

106
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:56,120
hour yeah it's terrible it's terrible

107
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:57,949
driving back home and actually Oahu is

108
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,360
pretty bad it's kind of like la have you

109
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:01,729
been there have you driven there it's

110
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,830
pretty low it's slow yeah but the lanes

111
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:05,389
are so narrow and like it's I mean

112
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:08,720
that's one of the reasons I actually

113
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:10,909
don't like ahoo as much and la is

114
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,190
literally a traffic just makes me upset

115
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:17,780
yeah I'm one of those people yeah one

116
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:20,509
who is it Oh wahoo was interesting

117
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,039
not my favorite not my favorite of the

118
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:25,969
islands we're out where else have you

119
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:27,500
I'm like humble bragging well I went

120
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:28,729
it's really funny the first time I went

121
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,789
to Hawaii we went to the Big Island

122
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:35,000
you're your town we didn't go to Hilo

123
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:36,650
though but went there with my parents

124
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,870
and Anthony it was like there it was

125
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:42,500
like our graduation gift I think

126
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:43,460
and they took Anthony along as well but

127
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,039
when you go on vacation with your

128
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,330
parents it's kind of I mean like it

129
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:48,979
doesn't matter where you go it's kind of

130
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:51,229
lame because you have to do whatever

131
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:56,330
they want to do right and also you know

132
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:57,620
we were 18 I was I was still 17 and you

133
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,389
know you can't drink at that time

134
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:02,360
there's so much you can do there yes

135
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:05,210
general yeah yeah well I saw some sea

136
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,819
turtles that was pretty dope okay yeah

137
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:09,319
so you know that we went to the volcano

138
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:11,419
that was that was like you know it's a

139
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:15,440
big bed right now it's a little more

140
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:18,560
interesting now a little more lit really

141
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:23,210
now it was cool Maui was like the sort

142
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:25,400
of cross between Kauai and Oahu I would

143
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:27,919
say mm-hmm where it's like it is

144
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,560
touristy but you still can get out yeah

145
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,180
and then there's like the if you want to

146
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,659
talk about narrow roads the the road to

147
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,949
Hana oh yeah dude well that that's the

148
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:39,400
Rope did you have a renter you're not

149
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:42,830
supposed to go on that road

150
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,090
we have a jeep oh yeah I don't think

151
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:48,560
you're supposed to go there in a rental

152
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:50,449
yeah it's crazy like it's dangerous dude

153
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,610
yeah well they have I know that I saw a

154
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:54,229
shirt that you could buy there and said

155
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,880
I survived the road to Hana because it's

156
00:06:54,229 --> 00:07:01,310
essentially most the time it's a

157
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:03,680
one-lane road and the locals bombed that

158
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:05,870
road and there's bridges that are only

159
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,990
wide enough for like one car uh-huh and

160
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:10,220
and so you know you see somebody coming

161
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,750
the other way you better get the hell

162
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:14,330
out of their way and like drive into a

163
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,880
ditch they'll just run they'll just run

164
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,419
you off the road yeah nuts it builds

165
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,180
character

166
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:22,460
yeah and then um and then kawaii Oh is

167
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,380
my favorite island like especially

168
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,750
living in LA where you know you don't

169
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,790
see a lot of green mm-hmm and the green

170
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:31,010
that is there is just kind of like brown

171
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,419
green and then you go to kawaii and like

172
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:35,750
everything it's like somebody turned the

173
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:38,120
contrast up in your eyes like just I

174
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:41,570
couldn't comprehend the greenness of

175
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,580
everything and then a Wahoo's like all

176
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,990

always ask people this especially if

181
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,960
they're white did you experience any

182
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,099
racism there because believe it or not I

183
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,669
don't know if people know this but in

184
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:04,669
Hawaii white people I from what I seen

185
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:06,139
experience the most racism which I know

186
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:07,639
a lot of people argue that you can't be

187
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:15,349
racist to white person and I don't agree

188
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:18,020
with that argument but I don't know I

189
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:20,419
growing up I've just I've seen the most

190
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:23,180
racism directed towards white people and

191
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:25,220
especially tourists I understand why

192
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:27,620
I've heard I always heard about the

193
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:33,080
racism towards white people there which

194
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:34,219
honestly I understand mm-hmm I mean did

195
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,339
you experience how they don't belong

196
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:38,390
locals I did I never I don't think I

197
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:40,580
ever really experienced anything

198
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:42,680
firsthand I haven't really experienced

199
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:46,310
anyone ever be rude to me from another

200
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:49,510
country I had one guy when I was in when

201
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,700
I was in Paris I had this one guy that

202
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,170
[Music]

203
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,390
I asked him if he spoke English in

204
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:56,040
French because I don't that was

205
00:08:54,390 --> 00:09:00,620
basically the only French word that I

206
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:04,350
knew and and he was like stem of D James

207
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:06,810
was that his food how about now maybe

208
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,790
yeah but I mean that's the rudest

209
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,560
anyone's ever been to me in any country

210
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:13,140
I think as long as you respect everybody

211
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,640
right then they'll show you equal amount

212
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,870
of respect unless they're just having a

213
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,520
really bad day you're just a nice guy

214
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:19,800
you know you don't in traffic you let

215
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,430
people go like maybe that's why I don't

216
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:26,100
know well in my experience I've I mean

217
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:28,290
Paco knows to like naturally I get it

218
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:31,020
makes sense you know I mean the islands

219
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:33,990
were illegally taken over right so

220
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:37,200
there's always that you know there's a

221
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:38,400
negativity there but um it's especially

222
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,860
towards tourists I feel like people

223
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,330
don't it doesn't matter how polite

224
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,760
naturally a lot of like local people

225
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:48,510
don't like tourists and is there cuz I

226
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:50,700
know I think I mean I've heard that like

227
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,290
in Hawaii like there's there's even

228
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:56,970
there's more racism against like

229
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:59,190
Filipinos there oh no I'd say with uh I

230
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:01,920
guess minorities in America mmm in

231
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:03,600
Hawaii there's equal racism to everyone

232
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,370
because it's such a melting pot yeah

233
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,560
like it's kind of like nobody really has

234
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:09,570
claimed like like up full claim cuz

235
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,580
you're yeah you're you you have you're

236
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:13,320
you're like Japanese yeah i think

237
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:16,290
there's everything yeah I think it's the

238
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:19,560
only state with no majority so everyone

239
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:21,960
is a minority there yeah and so everyone

240
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,330
and it's just like everyone is equally

241
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,100
racist to each other and it's just it's

242
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:29,490
except yeah but it's almost like less of

243
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:31,590
a problem like you but don't take racism

244
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:33,720
as seriously there yeah I think at least

245
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,680
growing up because it's like everybody's

246
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,600
different yeah

247
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,730
and like a lot of mix too so it's like

248
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,890
the races racist comments and stuff it's

249
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:42,690
just like it's mostly stereotypes there

250
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:45,170
are jokes most of the time yeah so

251
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:48,180
everyone knew a little oh yeah anything

252
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:51,120
yeah it's a little different but like I

253
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,770
said to me I still think the white

254
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,390
people got it the worst there well I

255
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:57,000
mean I get it because we're the most

256
00:10:54,390 --> 00:11:00,710
we're probably the most recent invaders

257
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,150
of Hawaii right you know so I get it and

258
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:04,470
there's a lot of money coming in there

259
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:06,570
people you know

260
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:09,330
a bunch of people from mainland America

261
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:11,550
saying oh actually I loved I'd love to

262
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:14,220
live there I'm just gonna bring all my

263
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:15,930
money I'm gonna buy this big house and

264
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,790
I'm just gonna drive around in my

265
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,320
Mercedes I'm just gonna buy everything

266
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,040
that I was at rich people sound like to

267
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,770
you

268
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,560
well there was actually a couple of

269
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:28,170
months ago though but this I guess

270
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,270
Caucasian female said I moved to Hawaii

271
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:32,040
a year ago fell in love with the place

272
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:34,020
and had like this whole like video on

273
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,160
Twitter of how like oh you know I'm

274
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,960
exactly what you how you're describing

275
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,760
he's doing this and a lot of people took

276
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,040
it and said you didn't fall in love with

277
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,990
Hawaii like you fell in love with being

278
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,510
able to vacation the whole time and

279
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:48,270
experience like all this stuff while

280
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:50,460
actual whole way and the people are very

281
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:52,890
different from what you're showing yeah

282
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:56,730
100% yeah and that's and that's that

283
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:58,050
disconnect and you got it you got to

284
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,100
really respect the people that are

285
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:02,100
already living there if you're ever

286
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:04,140
going to move to another place you have

287
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,950
to show that respect and understanding

288
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:08,970
of the people that were there before you

289
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:11,520
because then that happens and you look

290
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,480
like an idiot we should sell just that

291
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:16,110
clip right there

292
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,000
you like the Tourism Board oh you're

293
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,960
saying everything right right now okay

294
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,280

I used to watch your guys stuff all the

316
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,820
time I mean I told you when I when we

317
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,730

comedy yeah a lot of people don't know

321
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:33,630

324
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:39,210

339
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,290
the first Twitter question since we're

341
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,780
Twitter already I mean I kind of want to

342
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,850

343
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:22,470

00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:18,810
met cab for the first time there too

368
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:22,650
yeah people don't know about you to live

369
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:25,470

370
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:28,170
about YouTube live in our in our second

371
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:30,620
podcast and I was talking about how I

372
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:33,590
met Bo Burnham on the elevator and I did

373
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:36,740
recognize him because he's so damn tall

374
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:38,720
huge and in his old videos he'd play

375
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,220
with a keyboard on his lap yeah and he

376
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,020
had this giant keyboard so I just

377
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,660
thought he was like an average size or

378
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,230
small-time person - he's a giraffe he's

379
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,720
gigantic

380
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:51,200
he's super tall yeah also a super

381
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,490
talented guy I like - yeah um but yeah

382
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,110
that was the that was the first time we

383
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:56,830
met and I again like like you were

384
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:59,180
saying everybody used to be very

385
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:01,730
supportive of each other we used to have

386
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:03,170
those YouTube meetups even like random

387
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,330
ones like not even orchestrated by a

388
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:07,880
company or anything we just like there'd

389
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:10,040
be a spot and I mean I could barely go

390
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,870

but do you member SMP films yes yes yeah

396
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,370
that was the first time that a lot of

397
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,530
people met each other and it was in San

398
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:36,320
Francisco and Anthony and I drove out

399
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:39,440
there and we just hung out at the pier

400
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,960
and they're just like fans of various

401
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:46,310
channels Philip DeFranco was there I'm

402
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:48,050
still was sexy food yeah that's like

403
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:49,340
that weird thing you like bring up you

404
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,470
like oh yeah his channel used to be

405
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,850
called sexy feel they would think like

406
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,200
refer to him as that in my head

407
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:56,330
I still think I don't think Philip

408
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,700
DeFranco I think sexy Phil yes yeah for

409
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:00,980
this day I mean I wouldn't say that

410
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:04,430
there is there was a sort of strong

411
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:06,530
competition but back in that day there

412
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:08,900
was there was a competition to get into

413
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:12,140
spots on the page and there would be yes

414
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:16,040
most viewed and most commented ever did

415
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:18,230
most favorited so so there were a couple

416
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:21,700
times when when we both uploaded it like

417
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:23,750
the same time it's like ya know

418
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:25,730
especially if it's a video that you

419
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:27,830
really like - yeah or if it was like a

420
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:29,300
hot topic and then one of whoever was

421
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,590
releasing that topic first is like

422
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,510
dammit not people gonna think I copied

423
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:35,840
them but like there's no way we could

424
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:37,280
have made that in time you know but yeah

425
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,550
there other than that I mean like people

426
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:44,150
were more we're closer before I think

427
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:45,409
cuz the community was so small I mean it

428
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:48,830
YouTube was all about collaboration

429
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:51,409
until about I'd say four years ago

430
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:53,860
mm-hmm I remember the first the first

431
00:17:51,409 --> 00:17:56,690
time that I ever experienced like

432
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:58,970
YouTube drama directed at me was like a

433
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,919
channel that was that was talking crap

434
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:03,020
about Smosh the movie and it had just

435
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:05,090
came out so I was I was really proud of

436
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:06,740
like you know the fact that we were able

437
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:09,049
to make a movie I didn't think it was

438
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,059
like a masterpiece but I was like well

439
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:13,820
you know this is this is a sort of step

440
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:17,029
forward for you know YouTube creators

441
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:19,610
getting into other sort of venues and

442
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:22,760
and this one guy like made this very

443
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:24,770
like scathing review and I got so I got

444
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,320
so hurt by it because I'm like this is

445
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:30,860
another creator and he's tearing another

446
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:33,620
creator down right and and I was so used

447
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:35,539
to before that being everybody was

448
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,940
helping each other raising each other up

449
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:38,299
and so that was my first experience with

450
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,840
somebody

451
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:42,950
tearing another creator down and then it

452
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,260
turned out that it's actually really

453
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:48,140
lucrative to tear other people

454
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:50,750
especially now yeah yeah I mean it

455
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,669
drives interests I mean ya can't there's

456
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:56,779
no doubt about that I saw a tweet

457
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:57,230
recently by a keemstar I don't know his

458
00:18:56,779 --> 00:19:00,830
real name

459
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:02,690
keemstar that's not illegally first name

460
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:05,210
kiemce yeah they don't know what star a

461
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:07,610
star last name drama he just said

462
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:10,190
somebody tweeted at him like oh stop why

463
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:11,390
do you keep mentioning Jake Paul so much

464
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,770
like it would be nice if you didn't have

465
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:15,260
to mention him every video and he

466
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:17,029
tweeted back he's like well I mean he's

467
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:19,220
made me like two million dollars this

468
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:21,350
year so like if you wanna give me three

469
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:23,350
then I'll be happy to not mention it so

470
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:25,730
like and that's just him reporting on

471
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:28,130
drama not even being a part of it

472
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:29,690
technically yeah so I mean it it works

473
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:31,789
and it does Drive interest because when

474
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:33,260
things go down I mean like even for me

475
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:35,330
I'm not gonna lie I'm interested to see

476
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,820
like okay what did someone do now yeah

477
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:42,169
yeah I remember the first time I heard

478
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:44,840
about about drama alert I was like I was

479
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:46,190
that some kind of it was like a charity

480
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,529
livestream some youtubers were putting

481
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:52,640
on and this guy was like yeah like

482
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:55,039
there's this guy keemstar and like I

483
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,950
don't feel good watching his stuff but I

484
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,900
can't stop

485
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:01,910
I was like oh interesting so I went

486
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,410
checked it out and then yeah it just

487
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:05,780
kept getting bigger and bigger and

488
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:08,120
bigger yeah and I feel like you know the

489
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:12,770
the I feel like the real breakout with

490
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:15,860
YouTube drama was leafy oh right there

491
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:16,550
was that moment when leafy got really

492
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,220
really huge

493
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:21,050
you know tearing into people

494
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:25,750
unfortunately a lot of times they were

495
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:29,240
children yeah which isn't very cool I

496
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:31,190
mean like I certainly didn't said some

497
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,420
pretty stupid things when I was a little

498
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:34,340
kid and I wouldn't want to be crash site

499
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:37,010
criticized for it you know

500
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:39,710
and then I mean because he was the first

501
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:41,420
one and it got really big YouTube you

502
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:44,150
know basically cracked down on him

503
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:47,450
and destroyed his channel mm-hmm yeah

504
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:49,190
and um that's where we are today folks

505
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:51,620
yeah I don't know how we got there but

506
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:54,620
we were talking about how we were

507
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:57,260
competitive and it ends up now we're

508
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,880
just watching drama youtubers I guess

509
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:01,070
well I guess from you because we got his

510
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,660
perspective so from your perspective did

511
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:04,760
you ever feel like oh this is

512
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,320
competition even though like like Ian

513
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,300
seems like a very like Oh like let's

514
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,370
build up everybody but you on the other

515
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,690
hand I was ready to take them yeah

516
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:13,910
because you were a wrestler you actually

517
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:17,510
beat him up or actually we did wrestle

518
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:21,530
we did wrestle yeah no I felt um like I

519
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:24,320
said it was it was when I met everybody

520
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:25,790
it was more of an honour more than it

521
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,010
was kind of weird too because I was like

522
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:29,090
not you guys had already had meetups and

523
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:31,190
stuff like that but I could never go

524
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:32,780
because I was in Hawaii and then I moved

525
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:35,060
to Vegas for college and then I was able

526
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:36,980
to go to let YouTube live and that's

527
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,780
when I mean we've already talked I think

528
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,600
before then same with like keV and like

529
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:43,040
happyslip all those people back then but

530
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,600
I never met anyone even David

531
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,560
that's where I met David - David Choi

532
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:50,630
hmm I met YouTube live and everybody was

533
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:53,330
just so cool I wasn't expecting that but

534
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:57,200
everybody was cool I will say that keV

535
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:59,540
did say later way later down like five

536
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,220
years and then he was like hey man I

537
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:04,760
just wanna let you know back then I'm

538
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:06,470
super competitive with you but I was

539
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,660
like oh you know what I kind of felt

540
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:11,309
that to turn it before we were friends

541
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,929
because it's like another Asian dude

542
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:15,690
he was like bigger than me too at the

543
00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:18,269
time just and he was doing the blog

544
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:19,799
thing he kind of was like watching kinda

545
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:21,570
thick I guess Phil was doing that and

546
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:24,240
then what's that other Asian dude wine

547
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:25,830
wine Cohen who was uh he was doing that

548
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,690
too so kevin was like conspired off that

549
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:29,789
and then he thought that was the route

550
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:33,419
to go we're dropping some names and a

551
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:35,879
lot of new people who yeah Tony picture

552
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:37,440
Lancome isn't a directory it's one of

553
00:22:35,879 --> 00:22:40,559
the first I would say one of the first

554
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,980
like kind of rent style videos um and

555
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,269
I've watched him as well the wine Conan

556
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:47,220
like I was more into like skits and

557
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:50,840
stuff like that you know Smosh was doing

558
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:53,309
so uh I went kind of more that path and

559
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,869
yeah I guess in Kev's head I didn't

560
00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:56,850
really see myself as a competitor with

561
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:58,710
him but I I get it because we're kind of

562
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:00,090
like oh people would pair us up in the

563
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,559
comments cuz there were two Asian dudes

564
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:03,330
that's the only reason and younger

565
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:05,309
younger asian if I were a different

566
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:07,039
ethnicity I'm pretty sure it wouldn't

567
00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:10,259
have had those similar comments yeah

568
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:14,789
there was there was a time when we kind

569
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:17,549
of YouTube's seemed to be the sort of

570
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:20,220
kingdom of like Asian creators and gay

571
00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:23,759
creators yeah and we're like man if you

572
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:27,240
could just get a Gaugin creator you

573
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:28,710
would rule YouTube yep because yeah

574
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,210
there was a certain time when and I

575
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:32,519
think it was honestly just because they

576
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:35,549
weren't represented in any other form of

577
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:37,799
media and finally there was a space

578
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:40,799
where you would actually see an Asian

579
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:44,909
person on the screen obviously still

580
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:46,470
it's not that great but no it's very

581
00:23:44,909 --> 00:23:49,139
different but like the crazy rich Asians

582
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:51,869
really broke through I know

583
00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:53,309
Olivia who's in our cast she said like

584
00:23:51,869 --> 00:23:55,889
she's getting a lot more auditions

585
00:23:53,309 --> 00:23:59,970
there's a lot more interest in Asian

586
00:23:55,889 --> 00:24:02,519
actors yeah for sure yeah I mean there

587
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:05,429
I'm yeah I mean I did I don't want to

588
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:08,570
get too uh I got a little frustrated

589
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:13,980
sometimes about that whole scene because

590
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:16,379
it sounds so bad drop in your podcast I

591
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:18,090
just I feel like people especially in

592
00:24:16,379 --> 00:24:20,220
the Asian community don't aren't

593
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:21,929
acknowledging how much better it is and

594
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,490
how much better it's getting and they're

595
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:24,350
just like well we're still not like it

596
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:26,779
it's it

597
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:28,130
it's only a small group of people that

598
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:29,740
don't that still think well it's not

599
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:31,909
we're not even close it's just one movie

600
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:34,490
but they don't realize like how many

601
00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:36,200
more how hot of a commodity it is to

602
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:38,149
have Asians right now and then I

603
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,460
personally think they're gonna milk it

604
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:42,409
and then it's gonna be the opposite

605
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,730
again for a little bit I think they're

606
00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:45,350
gonna milk it right now because it's

607
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:46,639
gonna make money you're gonna see a drop

608
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,409
in that because people aren't gonna get

609
00:24:46,639 --> 00:24:49,820
a little over it over stature it's gonna

610
00:24:48,409 --> 00:24:51,350
be like a little trend thing and you

611
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:53,960
know but it's all I still think it's

612
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:56,450
better like it's still better I'm I mean

613
00:24:53,960 --> 00:25:00,289
I think I think China is becoming the

614
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:01,299
largest movie going yeah audience so I

615
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:04,039
mean I doesn't care about

616
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:06,649
asian-americans they care about Chinese

617
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:09,379
China China Chinese but I mean I think

618
00:25:06,649 --> 00:25:10,909
China's Italy into kpop you know I think

619
00:25:09,379 --> 00:25:13,070
they're I think they're interested in in

620
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:16,669
other and other people as well but

621
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:20,899
that's that's gotta be good I feel like

622
00:25:16,669 --> 00:25:22,639
China like they don't obviously what's

623
00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:24,710
his crazy rich Asians didn't do that

624
00:25:22,639 --> 00:25:26,809
well they're obviously didn't do it all

625
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:29,029
because what they want is Tom Cruise or

626
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:32,019
they want like the blockbuster Marvel

627
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:35,509
and I think what I heard is it put trade

628
00:25:32,019 --> 00:25:37,759
Chinese Chinese yep in like a bad light

629
00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:41,120
mmm well from there one of the things I

630
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:43,519
read it yes yeah yeah it makes sense but

631
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:46,730
did it actually play over there it did I

632
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:48,799
think it didn't do well mmm yeah cuz

633
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:51,110
it's hard to get I think only a certain

634
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:54,889
number of movies American made movies

635
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:56,990
actually are allowed in and from what

636
00:25:54,889 --> 00:25:58,580
maybe I'm maybe this is totally bad

637
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:02,389
information but from what I heard you

638
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:04,700
have to you have to work with certain

639
00:26:02,389 --> 00:26:06,769
Chinese companies they have to be like

640
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:10,399
involved in the project and you have to

641
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:13,279
also include certain Chinese actors in

642
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:15,559
your movie oh wow so that's why like if

643
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:17,809
you watch if you saw xxx return of

644
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:20,659
xander cage you know a masterpiece of a

645
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:23,629
movie I think it's I think that's like

646
00:26:20,659 --> 00:26:26,299
another H Brothers film which is it's a

647
00:26:23,629 --> 00:26:29,389
Chinese company production company I

648
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:31,220
think and you'll see there's a there's a

649
00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:34,039
Chinese actor in that and you'll also

650
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:36,470
see him in I think he's also in valerian

651
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:38,030
which was funded by some Chinese

652
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:39,470
companies

653
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:41,390
but it's really funny because because

654
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:43,850
there's also other roles where they have

655
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:46,340
to portray China in a good light yeah so

656
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:48,110
like with Transformers right when they

657
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:51,770
had like the big battle in in China

658
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:54,410
there's a scene yeah China comes and

659
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:56,480
saves the day well that's I mean that's

660
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:58,460
smart that's what makes money yeah you

661
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,470
make more money later yeah I think in

662
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:02,750
valerian was it Blair I think it was

663
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:04,070
valerian like there's like a there's a

664
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:06,140
Chinese character that saves the day

665
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:08,480
yeah at the end guys if we see China

666
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:10,670
four more times in the next 13 seconds

667
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,800
we're on route to beating Donald Trump

668
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:15,170
in his whole presidency well when I say

669
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,060
we're not saying Jane oh that's pretty

670
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:19,940
good dude thank you we're close though

671
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:21,140
we're close yeah we're probably on some

672
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:24,920
kind of list we probably won't be

673
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:29,390
allowed in so much TSA is like they're

674
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:30,500
on a no-fly list now anyway you so

675
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:34,250
before when I hit you up to do this

676
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:38,480
podcast it was like what three weeks ago

677
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:40,940
yeah I said I'd love to have you

678
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,280
obviously and you said that I would love

679
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:45,440
to do it but just wait a few weeks and

680
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:49,940
you announce something just very

681
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:52,760
recently do you want to talk about that

682
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:55,070
or yeah you yeah I would love to okay

683
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,870
can I talk about it I'd love to you tell

684
00:27:55,070 --> 00:28:02,540
me I don't know what your contract

685
00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:05,240
situations are like yeah so Smosh know

686
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:06,110
I'm burping now I do my big speech see

687
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,360
that's what happens

688
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:09,890
nervous it's all coming out it is yeah

689
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,900
whenever I had to explain this to my

690
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:14,450
parents and my family friends I I kept

691
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:17,300
doing that was like the whole Smosh

692
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:19,250
situation yeah I think it's just like a

693
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:21,620
weird like it's a weird sort of like

694
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:25,130
emotional reaction cuz it's it's been

695
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:28,490
like crazy so okay so backing it up a

696
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:33,200
little bit we sold Smosh to a company

697
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:36,230
called alloy digital in like 2011 or so

698
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,700
later on that company merged with this

699
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:39,710
company called break and they became

700
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:41,260
defy media which a lot of people know

701
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:49,210
about now

702
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:51,370
great reputation sarcasm yeah and in

703
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:55,660
October like late October early November

704
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:58,240
they very quickly closed down the whole

705
00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:00,790
company and laid everyone off with very

706
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,250
little warning right and that left Smosh

707
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:06,460
in a weird place because I don't own it

708
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:07,870
it's not like it's not like because they

709
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,680
went out of business I get Smosh back

710
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:10,960
right

711
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:15,610
so essentially fell in the hands of the

712
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:19,450
bank and I then worked with the

713
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:23,010
consultant for like four months to find

714
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:26,620
it a new home make sure that it got into

715
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:27,730
the right hands and if it didn't go into

716
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:30,160
the right hands then I wouldn't be a

717
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:31,690
part of Smosh I would leave and probably

718
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,160
mostly everyone else would leave and

719
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:38,520
then and then that company would be

720
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:42,310
known for killing Smosh right but

721
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:44,530
basically at the final hour when this

722
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:50,650
there was a really really bad foreign

723
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:52,320
company that almost got it and I it

724
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:55,690
would have been bad I would have left

725
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:58,270
rhett and Link hit us up rhett and Link

726
00:29:55,690 --> 00:30:00,070
the og youtubers are still there in it

727
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:01,630
don't kill in the game

728
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:05,050
some people might know him is good

729
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:08,350
mythical morning they came in and they

730
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:10,930
save the day they bought Smosh so so now

731
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:14,140
Smosh is a part of their mythical

732
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:16,540
entertainment thing and it's really

733
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:19,870
honestly and I'm not saying this because

734
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:23,110
I have to it's the best outcome because

735
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:25,470
it they're not owned by anyone like they

736
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:28,000
own rhett and Link own mythical entirely

737
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:30,280
so they don't have they don't have any

738
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,560
like larger company to report to that

739
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,210
can shut them down or they don't have

740
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:38,380
any investors that could just pull

741
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:42,430
funding or whatever so now we basically

742
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:44,920
get to really look at everything that is

743
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:47,680
Smosh and just kind of you know take

744
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:50,770
apart the Machine look at what doesn't

745
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:53,850
work throw that out and put some new

746
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:55,529
pieces and that that we wanted

747
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:58,889
you know we think can make the machine

748
00:30:55,529 --> 00:31:02,399
work a little better it's it's been a

749
00:30:58,889 --> 00:31:05,190
really it's been a tough ass four months

750
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:07,049
every day like we would we would go into

751
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:09,419
meetings with investors or you know

752
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:12,539
other sort of people and you know we'd

753
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:14,609
hear like yes we can we can fund this

754
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:16,049
bah blah blah and then we get a call

755
00:31:14,609 --> 00:31:18,659
like the next day and be like oh sorry

756
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:19,379
just not in the time and like oh well

757
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:21,029
now we're screwed

758
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:22,859
and like every day it was like it was

759
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:24,600
like you know highs and lows we're gonna

760
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:25,979
make it we're not gonna make it like it

761
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:30,210
we're not gonna make it and it was like

762
00:31:25,979 --> 00:31:32,909
it was draining as hell and I was under

763
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:35,849
NDA and all those other stuff so I

764
00:31:32,909 --> 00:31:38,279
couldn't tell I couldn't really keep

765
00:31:35,849 --> 00:31:40,679
everyone in the Smosh family informed as

766
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:43,320
to every step that was going on so I

767
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:45,239
just had to be like hey like you know if

768
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,559
you're able to let's keep getting

769
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:48,599
together and making videos because

770
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,999
somebody had defied me access to the

771
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:54,690
channel so I was still uploading right

772
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:57,809
but I hadn't been actually managing a

773
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:59,549
channel and so long which is like it

774
00:31:57,809 --> 00:32:01,590
sounds so silly from like the outside

775
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:04,679
but no I know that's weird

776
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:06,479
yeah we have three channels one before

777
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:07,859
if you're counting else Smosh but I

778
00:32:06,479 --> 00:32:12,029
didn't I didn't run that during the

779
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:14,909
downtime but three channels and I am now

780
00:32:12,029 --> 00:32:17,489
in charge of uploading and making sure

781
00:32:14,909 --> 00:32:19,529
like the video files are correct getting

782
00:32:17,489 --> 00:32:23,129
all the metadata on there like

783
00:32:19,529 --> 00:32:24,960
thumbnails it was a pain in the ass

784
00:32:23,129 --> 00:32:27,779
meanwhile trying to also make sure that

785
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,369
Smosh doesn't go into the hands of right

786
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,320
some help [ __ ] ass company

787
00:32:29,369 --> 00:32:31,559
congratulations dude you did it thank

788
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,220
you

789
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:36,779
oh you're waiting for that I wasn't sure

790
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,249
when to bring it out that was good so I

791
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:40,559
mean that's I mean that's great

792
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:41,970
but what does that mean like coming from

793
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,429
a viewer perspective was that mean force

794
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:49,429
Marcia what is that gonna change like

795
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:52,049
well if I had my biggest issue with defy

796
00:32:49,429 --> 00:32:52,739
was just the leadership it was really

797
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:56,809
really bad

798
00:32:52,739 --> 00:32:59,639
they didn't really put much effort into

799
00:32:56,809 --> 00:33:02,249
Smosh they just kind of like Smosh was

800
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:04,470
successful so they just kind of let it

801
00:33:02,249 --> 00:33:06,119
do its own thing and then they I think

802
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,640
probably put a lot of money into their

803
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:09,520
things

804
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:12,150
that maybe didn't work out which is you

805
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:14,890
know typical company stuff I can't like

806
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:17,049
yeah define did some really bad things I

807
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:20,410
can't say that everything defi did was

808
00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:22,120
evil and bad you know they they

809
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:25,720
obviously supported us for many many

810
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:27,460
years and we did gross mosh with them so

811
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,799
I can't I can't completely dump on them

812
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:33,850
but some of the people at the top were

813
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:35,730
bad uh-huh really bad and I'm not a fan

814
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:38,890
of them and I'm glad that were no longer

815
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:41,230
associated with them I now have a

816
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:43,510
leadership position in Smosh so I'm able

817
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:45,730
to have a say in what happens next

818
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:49,210
that's really exciting there's a lot of

819
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:52,510
things that defy didn't do that I felt

820
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:55,179
was a really big oversight about in

821
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:57,070
terms of a content like where they were

822
00:33:55,179 --> 00:33:59,080
you allowed to just say hey I have this

823
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:03,160
great idea yeah I want to do this on

824
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:07,120
this day they were really they were

825
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:09,220
really afraid of of legal things right

826
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,520
so every single script got passed

827
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:14,740
through a lawyer got it and and they

828
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,600
they even towards the end got nervous

829
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:18,190
about like mentioning brands because

830
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,750
they're like whoa you know we never know

831
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:21,909
you never know if like we're gonna do a

832
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:23,379
brand deal with them or whatever it got

833
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:26,050
really ridiculous and they were also

834
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:28,359
really afraid of some of the new YouTube

835
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:31,419
guidelines so they're like okay you can

836
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:35,490
never show a gun you can never show like

837
00:34:31,419 --> 00:34:37,780
somebody that like like died in a video

838
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:39,000
even if it's a comical like if somebody

839
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,230
gets hit in the head with like a

840
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,790
football and they fall on the ground

841
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:47,129
they look dead like I can't do that

842
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:50,109
that's crazy yeah it was see I I always

843
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:51,550
felt that to be honest I felt like when

844
00:34:50,109 --> 00:34:53,590
that change happened with you guys and

845
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:56,320
I'm officer I didn't say anything you

846
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:59,080
know yeah but I've always wondered I

847
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,700
don't know why I'm asking you now I did

848
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,440
always wonder like what kind of control

849
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:04,390
did you guys have at that point we had

850
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,930
we had a considerable amount of creative

851
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:07,810
control

852
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:10,180
there was just yes though those things

853
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:13,780
especially towards the end did get more

854
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:16,090
constrained right and like I don't I

855
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:18,490
don't want to promise people like like

856
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:20,530
oh like our videos are gonna be twice as

857
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:22,810
good now because that's

858
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:25,720
not fair like I I think we were already

859
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:28,060
doing a good job with with the YouTube

860
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:30,340
content yeah I do think we can do better

861
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:32,410
and I think we will yeah

862
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:34,240
now that we have more control and we're

863
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:36,910
gonna we're probably gonna loosen up on

864
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,040
some things but I think there's so much

865
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:42,910
more out there than just YouTube mm-hmm

866
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:46,840
I do want to figure out a touring thing

867
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:49,030
because with what we are it's it's so

868
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,920
different nowadays from other YouTube

869
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:52,510
content like you and me are pretty much

870
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:55,420
like the only people doing sketch comedy

871
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:57,220
on YouTube now so some are sort of

872
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:59,890
offering with the live show is very

873
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:02,950
different from you know somebody that's

874
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:05,650
a vlogger right we have a cast of people

875
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:08,350
that can we can create a sort of a live

876
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:09,940
like a variety show almost like a live

877
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:11,110
show and some other stuff I don't want

878
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:14,140
promise anything because this is all

879
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:15,970
very very preliminary and it's all we're

880
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:18,430
gonna leave this and say there's a new

881
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:20,380
live show coming we're taking pounds if

00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:22,690
sound bites yeah yeah there's a live

883
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:24,820
show variety yeah

884
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:27,580

about this in in in our podcast as well

907
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:19,390
at the same exact day basically what

908
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,310
we're saying is like you know all the

909
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:24,220
people that are that are pestering us

910
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:26,770
and pestering him for him do I come back

911
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:29,500
to Smosh it's it's really disrespectful

912
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:31,900
to both of us mm-hmm like especially to

913
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:34,150
him because like he's doing what he

914
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,420
wants to do he didn't want to be doing

915
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:36,190
his

916
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:38,079
his channel he wouldn't be doing it and

917
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:40,359
for people that go on his channel and

918
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,589
say come back to Smosh like you're only

919
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:46,630
good on Smosh like that's super

920
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:48,190
disrespectful yeah so yeah I had to have

921
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:50,650
known that was gonna happen right Oh

922
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:53,619
100% yeah so I mean cuz a lot of a lot

923
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:56,170
of his beef when he left was was about

924
00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:57,819
to Phi so I see a lot of people think

925
00:37:56,170 --> 00:38:00,400
like well now that defines of the

926
00:37:57,819 --> 00:38:02,710
picture it's it's gonna like you can

927
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,170
come back but it's it's obviously a

928
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:07,960
little bit more than that it's you know

929
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:10,690
obviously we've become creatively kind

930
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:13,210
of two different people so I mean you

931
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:15,420
know yeah with with with a duo or any

932
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:19,210
kind of any kind of partnership

933
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:24,059
creatively it it's hard to sometimes

934
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:26,349
come to an agreement on on content and

935
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:29,710
you know the fact the fact that we

936
00:38:26,349 --> 00:38:35,940
remained a partnership creatively for so

937
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:38,890
many years is kind of a wonder yeah yeah

938
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:40,900
but the door is absolutely open for him

939
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:42,190
to come back and be in videos like I

940
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:45,910
would be really excited with the

941
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:48,700
prospect of him be like showing up I

942
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:50,589
think it could be really cool but the

943
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:52,839
first video video that he's back there's

944
00:38:50,589 --> 00:38:54,940
a gun and he gets shot and then dies

945
00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:56,260
just so it all comes full circle yeah

946
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:59,559
we're gonna we're gonna Bruce Lee him

947
00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:02,319
yeah just because they can now yeah and

948
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:03,790
it get it gets to monetizing you can and

949
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:05,470
then you gotta go back to your own ways

950
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:06,940
I mean I'm we're the same way even now

951
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:08,799
it's like we gotta think about I mean

952
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:11,410
we'd get to do a little bit more edgy

953
00:39:08,799 --> 00:39:12,940
things but like I've experienced it too

954
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:14,589
in terms of just like you mean using

955
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:15,880
like I sometimes would get away with

956
00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:16,750
using like two seconds of a song you

957
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,390
can't do that anymore

958
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:22,510
yeah even if it's a mention you know we

959
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:25,780
got we got flagged for we got a flag

960
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:28,390
from a video from like seven years ago

961
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:33,190
where Anthony and I are singing I'll

962
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:36,880
make love to you acapella in bad Russian

963
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:38,859
accents that is so that's not even being

964
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,380
picked up by YouTube that's literally

965
00:39:38,859 --> 00:39:44,440
someone look flagging it down it's at

966
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:47,790
like the end card so I don't I don't

967
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:50,130
know how somebody found that because

968
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:51,930
not singing it on key we're singing bad

969
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:53,820
accents that's how good you were and

970
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:58,110
there's no music playing behind it

971
00:39:53,820 --> 00:40:00,030
uh-huh and somehow some someone

972
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:02,340
physically you had to watch it and be

973
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:04,170
like that is I know who owns the rights

974
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:06,180
to this and they go I don't know I don't

975
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:07,050
know it's like covers supposed to be

976
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:09,060
okay

977
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:10,470
no you'd have to get some kind of

978
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:14,370
resolution of some sort or be with like

979
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:15,990
a MCN yeah covers aren't aren't you

980
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:19,170
can't do covers covers aren't covered

981
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:21,630
covers on Cobra broke the claiming

982
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:23,640
business is actually really a really big

983
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:26,570
business yeah there's a lot of money in

984
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:31,110
claiming so a lot of large companies

985
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:34,350
will hire businesses to just scour

986
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:36,630
YouTube and claim videos well now it's

987
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:38,340
it's automatic like a lot of it's

988
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:40,770
automatic a lot of it is but there's

989
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:43,080
still a lot of manual no there are I

990
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:46,710
mean i-i've in this past year I mention

991
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:50,070
it to another video I think I've gotten

992
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:51,990
like literally probably ten times more

993
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:53,610
and probably like half my videos got

994
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:56,640
claimed and it's still happening every

995
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:58,590
like couple every week some of them

996
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,690
justified some you can do I could

997
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:02,520
dispute but like it's such a long

998
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:04,710
process it's like almost not worth the

999
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,660
energy it's like okay fine okay

1000
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:08,190
this video still gets views over time

1001
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:10,110
and I get over time you're gonna get a

1002
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:11,580
lot more but like I just don't have the

1003
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:14,010
energy to like dispute every single

1004
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:16,110
thing yeah and some are some are

1005
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:19,200
justified I get it it's just like kind

1006
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:22,260
of ridiculous yeah we had we had one

1007
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,180
that was really annoying we have this

1008
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,620
really this really fun series on our

1009
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:29,460
second channel called try not to laugh

1010
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:31,650
where somebody sits on a stool and then

1011
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,880
people dress up in props and stuff in

1012
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:34,380
the background then they come out and

1013
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,110
they get thirty seconds to try to make

1014
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:40,830
that person laugh right and we had this

1015
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:42,810
guy his name on like instagrams juji mu

1016
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:44,160
foo he's like this big buff guy and he

1017
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:47,010
does like backflips and all these like

1018
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:52,230
crazy acrobatics I had him on the show

1019
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:55,620
and we use like two like short clips of

1020
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:58,500
him to like show what he does and Juke

1021
00:41:55,620 --> 00:42:00,460
and media claim that really whole damn

1022
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,589
video and it's like because

1023
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:04,599
we had him on the video like he would be

1024
00:42:02,589 --> 00:42:07,119
cool with us using these clips but

1025
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:09,670
[ __ ] jookin we can't curse on this I

1026
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:19,750
don't know we never said our first

1027
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:22,300
really sponsor on this one so there

1028
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:23,500
isn't so yeah I don't think sponsors

1029
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,359
really care with pod casts I don't think

1030
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:27,250
they do either I just never done it yeah

1031
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:30,730
but you could be the one okay I was like

1032
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:32,230
so I was occasionally I cannot talk

1033
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:34,810
occasionally I was self censoring myself

1034
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:38,200
because I wasn't sure cuz most podcasts

1035
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:45,790
are like who cares I mean just all say

1036
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:47,470
it once together I mean if it comes out

1037
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:49,240
naturally then it will you know oh this

1038
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:52,030
I just I get really upset I just have a

1039
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:54,520
lot of hatred for jookin oh just like I

1040
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:56,920
just hate that whole business model they

1041
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:59,080
literally just they just buy clips and

1042
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,670
then license them and whenever somebody

1043
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:02,980
uses their clip then they just claim it

1044
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:05,650
and take the money it's it's a it's a

1045
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:08,440
shitty business oh I don't know I just

1046
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:09,010
curse together great I just really don't

1047
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,810
like chicken

1048
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:12,369
you really don't really coming out like

1049
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:14,619

1050
00:43:12,369 --> 00:43:19,960
help man we're about to set up a fight

1051
00:43:14,619 --> 00:43:22,330

wrestling our wrestling match was

1056
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,690
probably the most confrontational I've

1057
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:33,760
ever been with anybody really yeah that

1058
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:35,349

wrestled and he was in his suit and it

1062
00:43:41,349 --> 00:43:44,109
was a little revealing

1063
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:50,589
I was gonna say you can kind of see my

1064
00:43:44,109 --> 00:43:52,240
dog through it yeah interested yeah I

1065
00:43:50,589 --> 00:43:54,400
was wearing a blue suit and I tried to

1066
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,170
last in the ring what 30 seconds so I

1067
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,359
just ran around the ring and tried to

1068
00:43:56,170 --> 00:44:03,849
avoid you actually think I saw that one

1069
00:43:58,359 --> 00:44:04,330

1070
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:05,890
more time

1071
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:08,140
I was just wondering yes I mean you know

1072
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:10,060
everybody's that whole scene is blowing

1073
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:12,670
up it helps everybody that does it yeah

1074
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:13,390
I'm sure it does but then after the

1075
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:16,960
match

1076
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:19,300
nobody cares true it's you know what I

1077
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,190

1078
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:23,590
got into a boxing match and they knocked

1079
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:25,960
me out so hard I peed myself

1080
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:28,480
I think people would understand that

1081
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:31,690
yeah but that was a terrible sex way

1082
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,090

and by yeah I will say that I I did

1097
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:14,770
remember that one part from the boxing

1098
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:17,020
match oh it's really funny because like

1099
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:20,470
you know I didn't really want to support

1100
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:23,410
that that match so uh there was a group

1101
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:25,690
of there's a group of maybe maybe like

1102
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:27,730
twenty of us that all went over to one

1103
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:33,640
person's house so we only had to pay for

1104
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:36,460

00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:31,900
I'm just the most important thing but I

1128
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:33,759

1129
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:35,170

1130
00:46:33,759 --> 00:46:40,569

1131
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:43,150
um I'll hit you up to uh or who if you

1132
00:46:40,569 --> 00:46:53,710
had to who would I box yep

1133
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:55,450
if I had to everyone's like oh there's

1134
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:56,859
no way we could hit each other we're so

1135
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:58,930
passive-aggressive against each other

1136
00:46:56,859 --> 00:47:00,549
but if you had to though I don't think

1137
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:02,380
of them standing any worse quite

1138
00:47:00,549 --> 00:47:04,119
everywhere just like talking about each

1139
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:05,829
other yeah I don't think we ever even

1140
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:10,059
like raised our voices at each other

1141
00:47:05,829 --> 00:47:11,380
yeah like yeah I was gonna say like one

1142
00:47:10,059 --> 00:47:18,069
of it one of the people that was running

1143
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:20,859
to Phi or Junkin junket yeah yeah I'll

1144
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:21,880
box Juke and media yeah okay I shouldn't

1145
00:47:20,859 --> 00:47:25,299
say that because maybe there's some like

1146
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:27,279
MMA bro that runs that yeah website I

1147
00:47:25,299 --> 00:47:30,339
don't know I don't know if I ever said

1148
00:47:27,279 --> 00:47:32,499
this publicly and I don't think he would

1149
00:47:30,339 --> 00:47:34,569
mind but when that all was happening as

1150
00:47:32,499 --> 00:47:36,489
it was getting planned out the second

1151
00:47:34,569 --> 00:47:39,190
the second I think no the first fight

1152
00:47:36,489 --> 00:47:41,829
actually rice come hit me up and he

1153
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:44,170
wanted to box me I think you did mention

1154
00:47:41,829 --> 00:47:45,489
this I might have mentioned it I don't

1155
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:50,049
know where though where would I have

1156
00:47:45,489 --> 00:47:51,549
mentioned it when I think oh maybe it

1157
00:47:50,049 --> 00:47:53,049
was one I don't think I at least yeah I

1158
00:47:51,549 --> 00:47:55,089
was like one of those like really our

1159
00:47:53,049 --> 00:47:59,289
test versions okay

1160
00:47:55,089 --> 00:48:03,279
I don't think like boxing or I mean you

1161
00:47:59,289 --> 00:48:05,470
would still annihilate him but he might

1162
00:48:03,279 --> 00:48:07,059
be a great boxer for his good reach he's

1163
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:09,039
got he's wrong and I don't know how to

1164
00:48:07,059 --> 00:48:11,140
you right it was an MMA fight I think

1165
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:12,430
I'd be pretty confident but not in

1166
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:14,079
boxing I'm a browser

1167
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:16,569
oh you're what I mean it's the same it's

1168
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:19,869
the same advantage that Logan had you're

1169
00:48:16,569 --> 00:48:21,999
a natural-born athlete well no I

1170
00:48:19,869 --> 00:48:25,299
wouldn't say not I wouldn't say natural

1171
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:27,759
okay but I mean you're and I'm very much

1172
00:48:25,299 --> 00:48:30,009
out of shape compared to like when I

1173
00:48:27,759 --> 00:48:32,410
used to do a lot of sports he says that

1174
00:48:30,009 --> 00:48:36,549
and he's like as you said he is flexing

1175
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:37,660
a little bit but I mean like obviously

1176
00:48:36,549 --> 00:48:39,430
you're you're a highly

1177
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:40,990
Pettit of person you were where you

1178
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:42,880
liked state-ranked or something with

1179
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:45,160
with wrestling or wrestling yeah he won

1180
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,770
first place in States come on man it's a

1181
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:50,559
small states Hawaii yeah it's not like

1182
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:52,359
it was uh all right how strong was he

1183
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:54,250
when he beat you up though and he was

1184
00:48:52,359 --> 00:48:55,660
smiling the whole time right yeah he

1185
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:58,990
wasn't really trying that's the thing

1186
00:48:55,660 --> 00:49:01,180
it's necessary think cuz running around

1187
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:04,780
in a slipper I was suit I was fighting

1188
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:06,460
for my life well that would be an

1189
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:09,339
interesting that would be an interesting

1190
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:11,200
fight I don't say it I wouldn't say you

1191
00:49:09,339 --> 00:49:13,180
should do it though no I mean the thing

1192
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,220
is I the only reason I would do it if it

1193
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:18,220
were MMA because I'm a fan of the sport

1194
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:19,690
yeah and I already have some experience

1195
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:22,569
in it so I wouldn't have to put in like

1196
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:24,460
you know granted his experience you know

1197
00:49:22,569 --> 00:49:26,109
that's not fair if he has none but if he

1198
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:27,280
does have some experience in boxing yeah

1199
00:49:26,109 --> 00:49:29,020
and I've experienced in wrestling and

1200
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,000
judo then it kind of balances a little

1201
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:33,640
bit more you know yeah I mean it just

1202
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,619
wouldn't be fair no it would

1203
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:38,020
it wouldn't be fun to watch if it was

1204
00:49:35,619 --> 00:49:39,880
MMA because you would just take him down

1205
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:41,829
and put him in some kind of hold unless

1206
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,299
you're really good and nobody knew he's

1207
00:49:41,829 --> 00:49:45,099
better he's really good at like

1208
00:49:43,299 --> 00:49:47,170
surprisingly athletic at basketball we

1209
00:49:45,099 --> 00:49:48,490
played with him oh really he's good he's

1210
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:50,619
actually really good at basketball and

1211
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:52,299
honestly when I first looked at him I

1212
00:49:50,619 --> 00:49:54,579
didn't think he was gonna be athletic

1213
00:49:52,299 --> 00:49:56,859
he's pretty good okay well maybe I take

1214
00:49:54,579 --> 00:49:57,910
everything I said maybe he was like he's

1215
00:49:56,859 --> 00:49:59,950
a sleeper he's one of those people

1216
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:02,049
who've been training and he thinks like

1217
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:04,539
I think he doesn't know how to fight but

1218
00:50:02,049 --> 00:50:07,020
he can fight he's waiting that's what I

1219
00:50:04,539 --> 00:50:10,180
said I didn't fall for the trap rice

1220
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:12,220
let's try Brian yeah nice try don't and

1221
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:12,819
while you by your screen name yeah why

1222
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:14,260
were you buying

1223
00:50:12,819 --> 00:50:16,660
why were you balling with rice gum

1224
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:18,400
what's that all about he uh so he lived

1225
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:21,430
out here so this is like right when he

1226
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:23,920
was kind of getting big we uh he kind of

1227
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:25,630
reached out and it was uh I would say I

1228
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,359
even mentioned it in that song exposed

1229
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:30,730
song that he when I went out we hung out

1230
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:32,319
with him he was like you know I know he

1231
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:34,329
has a bad rap and stuff like that and he

1232
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:36,400
does the whole like forcing kids but

1233
00:50:34,329 --> 00:50:39,789
when I know he's like a very nice shy

1234
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:42,250
kind of I guess a kid at the time he's

1235
00:50:39,789 --> 00:50:45,059
um he's probably always been a nice

1236
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:49,390
person it's just I just have a persona

1237
00:50:45,059 --> 00:50:50,770
exactly yeah but you know we we filmed

1238
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:51,279
with him and I dare you a long time ago

1239
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:53,469
he was story

1240
00:50:51,279 --> 00:50:55,419
to get big and I kind of see like you

1241
00:50:53,469 --> 00:50:57,819
know okay he's kind of he's feeling it

1242
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:58,869
you know I mean everybody goes through

1243
00:50:57,819 --> 00:51:00,759
it a little bit right when you start

1244
00:50:58,869 --> 00:51:01,869
getting that fame you kind of feel like

1245
00:51:00,759 --> 00:51:03,789
oh I'm getting more money than I ever

1246
00:51:01,869 --> 00:51:07,539
thought I would I'm getting more girls

1247
00:51:03,789 --> 00:51:09,669
or you know whatever it is and at the

1248
00:51:07,539 --> 00:51:12,189
same time he was like you know we had

1249
00:51:09,669 --> 00:51:13,390
this really deep talk after we played

1250
00:51:12,189 --> 00:51:15,669
basketball together I was driving him

1251
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:17,529
home and he was just like stressing like

1252
00:51:15,669 --> 00:51:19,269
I don't know like maybe I should move to

1253
00:51:17,529 --> 00:51:21,009
LA or what do you think I should do like

1254
00:51:19,269 --> 00:51:23,409
he's very like he was very kind of um

1255
00:51:21,009 --> 00:51:24,549
I'm sure he doesn't actually I don't

1256
00:51:23,409 --> 00:51:27,909
know if he'll mind if I'm talking about

1257
00:51:24,549 --> 00:51:29,799
it but it was just very normal he's a

1258
00:51:27,909 --> 00:51:33,699
normal guy going through like a lot of

1259
00:51:29,799 --> 00:51:35,679
stress yeah and I think part of that you

1260
00:51:33,699 --> 00:51:37,900
know whether it's a persona or whether

1261
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:39,880
it's him he it's kind of like a defense

1262
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,959
mechanism I think I think it's because

1263
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,849
he feels that's where he feels

1264
00:51:40,959 --> 00:51:44,979
comfortable that's what got him made and

1265
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:46,809
he kind of just ran with it and you know

1266
00:51:44,979 --> 00:51:48,159
just liked it like a prank channel or

1267
00:51:46,809 --> 00:51:50,409
anything you have to top yourself you

1268
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:53,769
have to go above and beyond consistently

1269
00:51:50,409 --> 00:51:55,359
or else people lose interest yep so yeah

1270
00:51:53,769 --> 00:51:58,329
I think happened I mean when you when

1271
00:51:55,359 --> 00:52:01,989
you build your whole when you build your

1272
00:51:58,329 --> 00:52:04,239
whole persona around always raising the

1273
00:52:01,989 --> 00:52:06,159
bar and pushing the envelope then you

1274
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:08,169
like you said you have to keep pushing

1275
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:11,169
the envelope yeah if that's what your

1276
00:52:08,169 --> 00:52:13,509
game is eventually you're you're going

1277
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:15,400
to reach a breaking point yeah whether

1278
00:52:13,509 --> 00:52:16,119
it's your content or your mental

1279
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,669
well-being

1280
00:52:16,119 --> 00:52:21,130
exactly see but that's why I think like

1281
00:52:18,669 --> 00:52:23,229
um like I get why he gets the hate he

1282
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:26,019
gets it's the content that he puts out

1283
00:52:23,229 --> 00:52:27,489
right so but I don't think a lot of

1284
00:52:26,019 --> 00:52:30,159
people know who he really is

1285
00:52:27,489 --> 00:52:31,239
and that I think it's also just I mean

1286
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:33,159
it's not their fault for not knowing

1287
00:52:31,239 --> 00:52:34,630
that but I think a lot of youtubers are

1288
00:52:33,159 --> 00:52:36,429
like that actually they know that it

1289
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:38,109
works I'm sure there's some that are

1290
00:52:36,429 --> 00:52:40,059
very genuine that are very not saying

1291
00:52:38,109 --> 00:52:42,609
that he's not but I'm sure there there's

1292
00:52:40,059 --> 00:52:46,569
some that are very much just douchebag

1293
00:52:42,609 --> 00:52:48,459
[ __ ] but and they put on like a

1294
00:52:46,569 --> 00:52:55,419
family-friendly front yeah there's that

1295
00:52:48,459 --> 00:52:58,719
to it there's that you know that is like

1296
00:52:55,419 --> 00:53:01,179
strangely a thing yeah where if they're

1297
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:04,150
putting on like a nice sort of thing

1298
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:05,140
online then yeah I don't know no it's

1299
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:07,420
true yeah I mean I

1300
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:08,710
I we're not gonna say names but I'm sure

1301
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:10,510
we you know people over the years and

1302
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:12,730
stuff like that I mean most of the

1303
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:15,790
people I've met have all been wonderful

1304
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:17,320
yeah me too even if I even have never

1305
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:19,120
met I don't think I've ever met

1306
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,500
rice gum even if I met him in real life

1307
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,310
I don't think we had have a bad

1308
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,440
experience

1309
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:26,320
no get along just fine probably super

1310
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,610
pullet even when I met um Logan Paul for

1311
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:29,830
the first time I wasn't and he wasn't

1312
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:32,770
this is before like all the you know

1313
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:35,140
controversy and stuff like that just one

1314
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:37,000
of the nicest people and I only met him

1315
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:39,340
once but I you know he can't get much

1316
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,320
from one meeting but he just came up to

1317
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:43,630
me at a party he said oh I was I'm such

1318
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:45,370
a big fan of your your videos from back

1319
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:47,140
in the day I was like oh I like your

1320
00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:49,540
vines I didn't know he was on YouTube at

1321
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:51,340
the time but yeah it was like around

1322
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:53,350
that era and it was just like a normal

1323
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:55,900
conversation and then when all this

1324
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:58,660
stuff started happening I was like oh he

1325
00:53:55,900 --> 00:54:01,150
messed up well he's gonna get some PR

1326
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:07,120
for that made him bigger yeah and then

1327
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:08,590
just the thing is it just made him

1328
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:10,810
bigger and bigger so how can you really

1329
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:13,660
it's positive reinforcement yeah you

1330
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:16,480
know like in his head obviously it's

1331
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:18,310
like well yes all this drama things

1332
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:21,520
making people say some bad things about

1333
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:25,170
me but I'm also blowing up so like how

1334
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:28,600
can he yeah I mean it's all speculation

1335
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:30,520
but I think you know when you're

1336
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:33,010
creating content like that without any

1337
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:35,380
sort of without any kind of purpose yeah

1338
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:38,530
when you're just doing it because you

1339
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:40,390
need to push the envelope yeah you'll

1340
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:41,530
get a lot of views but you're not you're

1341
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:45,190
not I don't think you're really building

1342
00:54:41,530 --> 00:54:48,610
a core sort of audience and that's

1343
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:50,380
something that I feel like you know you

1344
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:52,810
guys have done I feel like that's

1345
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:53,950
something that Smosh is done like our

1346
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:57,100
audience has always been like not very

1347
00:54:53,950 --> 00:55:00,010
engaged but I feel like you know we've

1348
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:02,710
we've always had a sort of core and and

1349
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:04,870
you see those sort of channels that that

1350
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:07,230
have just followed a certain trend or

1351
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:10,210
they get locked into one sort of like

1352
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:11,680
format and they just ride that thing all

1353
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:13,390
the way up and then once the algorithm

1354
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:15,580
shifts you know and that trend is no

1355
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:17,980
longer good for the algorithm the bottom

1356
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:20,770
falls out from under those people

1357
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:23,230
except that the algorithm hasn't changed

1358
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:24,400
in a very long time it has there there

1359
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:26,140
are things in the algorithm that a

1360
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,490
change well I mean they're still doing

1361
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:29,200
well oh yeah that's true

1362
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:33,820
actually they're not what it was even

1363
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:35,290
last year but they're still huge yeah I

1364
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:36,850
mean there was there was like recent

1365
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:39,670
there was recent stuff that that picked

1366
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:42,340
him up a little bit again but you know

1367
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:43,869
that they kind of because they don't

1368
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:46,810
really stand for anything you know if I

1369
00:55:43,869 --> 00:55:49,330
have to they have to keep pushing the

1370
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:51,869
envelope and I mean I'll still say it

1371
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:54,550
like Logan Paul is extremely talented

1372
00:55:51,869 --> 00:55:58,660
yeah I do think he's really a really

1373
00:55:54,550 --> 00:56:00,790
talented guy so I just I'm just really

1374
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:02,890
disappointed because the after the

1375
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:05,050
forest then I was like I was like this

1376
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:08,490
is his chance to completely reinvent

1377
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:11,500
himself yeah and go down a new path and

1378
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:15,940
it'll be really good and he didn't do it

1379
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:18,550
and I mean he still obviously succeeded

1380
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:20,140
yeah very well I know what you mean it

1381
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:22,330
could have took that other turn and kind

1382
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:23,830
of like reinvented himself yeah like cuz

1383
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:25,990
it was such a big event that's like your

1384
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:27,310
perfect opportunity to I mean look at

1385
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:29,530
any celebrity goes through that stuff

1386
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:30,730
you know there people want that change

1387
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:33,040
and then you can always change it up

1388
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:35,590
again later but like the whole like it's

1389
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:38,310
very similar to that like at least how I

1390
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:41,230
see it is like the whole Miley Cyrus

1391
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:43,630
situation is like she was this very

1392
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:45,820
clean whatever girl and then people are

1393
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:48,700
like what the hell she turned into this

1394
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:50,500
Miley drug Miley twerking Miley and

1395
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:53,440
she's so out of character people were

1396
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:55,180
just like super interested but at the

1397
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,619
same time like hating on her like this

1398
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:58,480
is not how I should be she want a new

1399
00:56:56,619 --> 00:57:00,760
audience there but now that she's kind

1400
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,710
of reverted back to old Miley it's like

1401
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:04,900
oh now I want to root for this girl cuz

1402
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:06,250
she's like you know she's seeing her

1403
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:08,290
wrongs and like she's trying to be a

1404
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:11,290
better person and she's dating that

1405
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:12,790
famous dude Hemsworth again you know so

1406
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:15,670
it's like it's like a very I don't know

1407
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:18,250
I think it strategic yeah it's a really

1408
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:20,650
good really good career move I mean I

1409
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:20,950
guess before her Christina Aguilera did

1410
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:23,109
it

1411
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:25,990
I mean we all remember the dirty area

1412
00:57:23,109 --> 00:57:26,930
era of Christina Aguilera come on you

1413
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:29,240
guys remember it

1414
00:57:26,930 --> 00:57:31,279
I mean I'm trying to think of the people

1415
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:34,369
watching remember probably not

1416
00:57:31,279 --> 00:57:36,319
oh god world no yeah but that was the

1417
00:57:34,369 --> 00:57:38,059
thing like Christina Aguilera started

1418
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:39,980
out with like genie genie in a bottle

1419
00:57:38,059 --> 00:57:42,589
like she was like this kind of like a

1420
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:44,210
little bit risque but like still sort of

1421
00:57:42,589 --> 00:57:47,329
wholesome I think I don't know I wasn't

1422
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:50,270
like a big fan but then she came out

1423
00:57:47,329 --> 00:57:53,569
with dirty and she went like full-blown

1424
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:56,029
like like I'm like this sexy and like

1425
00:57:53,569 --> 00:58:00,490
you know as a freshman in high school

1426
00:57:56,029 --> 00:58:00,490
and that came out that was very stoked I

1427
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:05,539
mean it just Britney Spears same thing

1428
00:58:03,619 --> 00:58:07,970
right yeah yeah and then and then they

1429
00:58:05,539 --> 00:58:10,369
had kind of had that sort of with

1430
00:58:07,970 --> 00:58:13,430
Christina I feel had that sort of like

1431
00:58:10,369 --> 00:58:15,170
MIT like she matured and then she was

1432
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:17,390
like acted because she's an amazing

1433
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:19,460
singer so she was able just kind of like

1434
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:22,339
mature into this sort of like I am now

1435
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:24,740
like I am now a woman I'm mature woman

1436
00:58:22,339 --> 00:58:26,990
and people loved it but it's the same

1437
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:28,309
trend everything look at Justin Bieber

1438
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:30,529
same thing this innocent little kid

1439
00:58:28,309 --> 00:58:31,940
right plays like you look cute kid

1440
00:58:30,529 --> 00:58:33,380
that's like you want to support him all

1441
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:35,750
the little girls love him closer like

1442
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:37,910
this this man face like I'm I'm the man

1443
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:40,010
I'm gonna take off my shirt and then

1444
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:43,010
start you know get tattoos and stuff

1445
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:45,799
like that and look buff look but he is

1446
00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:47,779
you got buffer yeah um and then now he's

1447
00:58:45,799 --> 00:58:49,549
back into like well I'm going back to

1448
00:58:47,779 --> 00:58:50,839
church and well not that he didn't go to

1449
00:58:49,549 --> 00:58:53,210
church but you know he's putting on that

1450
00:58:50,839 --> 00:58:56,599
uh but I don't know I think it's the

1451
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:58,220
same trend I've seen with celebrities at

1452
00:58:56,599 --> 00:59:00,020
least oh it happens all the time and

1453
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:02,690
that was Logan's chance to go through

1454
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:04,430
that phase I think and then he could

1455
00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:06,920
always come back which I think would

1456
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:09,500
happen but yeah and I think he's just

1457
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:12,200
like uh it's an it's because people see

1458
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:14,240
that as being human that it's relatable

1459
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:16,549
like if someone is perfect and always

1460
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:18,380
perfect it's like wow I love this person

1461
00:59:16,549 --> 00:59:19,940
but I can't relate to them I would like

1462
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:22,339
to be this person but when you see

1463
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:24,079
someone fail and then and then they

1464
00:59:22,339 --> 00:59:26,119
succeed that's a story that you can

1465
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:27,410
align yourself with and be like if they

1466
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:29,029
can do it if they can go through

1467
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:31,250
something way tougher than I went

1468
00:59:29,029 --> 00:59:34,490
through then then that gives me hope

1469
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:37,520
yeah yeah I honestly I

1470
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:40,940
I thought Logan was gonna was gonna sort

1471
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:42,650
of like go down the the route of like

1472
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:44,599
raising awareness for suicide like a

1473
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:47,630
little bit later a little bit he did one

1474
00:59:44,599 --> 00:59:50,150
one video yeah one and then it was and

1475
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:52,730
then it was back to as far as I remember

1476
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:55,130
got back to the haze though a dead rat

1477
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:59,480
or something like I was like I really

1478
00:59:55,130 --> 01:00:01,819
like this soon man maybe could also be

1479
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:05,480
the people that he's around to knows I

1480
01:00:01,819 --> 01:00:06,560
mean like I mean yeah you gotta find you

1481
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,550
gotta find good people to surround

1482
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:09,619
yourself with if you surround yourself

1483
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:10,910

01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:37,390
would ever consider going on go on Logan

1493
01:00:33,619 --> 01:00:41,000
Paul's podcast yeah um I mean I don't

1494
01:00:37,390 --> 01:00:44,060
know it well enough but I saw clips on

1495
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,770
his Instagram of like doing some kind of

1496
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:47,480
crazy stuff here like some guy gets

1497
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:49,310
kicked in the balls or did he do some

1498
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:51,470
crazy stuff is it gonna I don't know if

1499
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:53,270
I would want to do that but if it were

1500
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:55,819
just to talk to him I'd have no issues

1501
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:57,500
talking to anyone to me at least I don't

1502
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:59,210
know about you I know people might

1503
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:01,550
associate your brand so it's like a

1504
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:03,010
little you know but to me I'm okay with

1505
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:05,540
talking to anyone

1506
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:08,930
yeah it seems like he's I don't know

1507
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:10,069
I've only seen clips again yeah it seems

1508
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:12,410
like he's kind of trying to do like a

1509
01:01:10,069 --> 01:01:15,050
Howard Stern thing mm-hmm like it's not

1510
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:16,520
like I thought again he I thought with

1511
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:18,140
the podcast he was gonna reinvent

1512
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:20,390
himself and go like a little bit more

1513
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:22,369
mature yeah and then it was like the

1514
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:26,140
third guest on was a porn star I'm like

1515
01:01:22,369 --> 01:01:26,140
all right dude

1516
01:01:27,619 --> 01:01:33,200
but I reading the comments and stuff it

1517
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:34,849
seems like people are really really

1518
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:38,089
liking it like apparently it's good

1519
01:01:34,849 --> 01:01:39,740
I mean it's entertainment yeah yeah you

1520
01:01:38,089 --> 01:01:42,290
know this I mean like this is just us

1521
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:43,940
hanging out and talking we're not

1522
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:46,540
kicking people in the balls we don't got

1523
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:50,060
like random strippers or whatever yeah

1524
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:53,119
but I'm not opposed to having a stripper

1525
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:54,410
to talk to or a pornstar sorry I would

1526
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:55,999
talk to a porn star

1527
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:58,579
I wouldn't make her do anything crazy

1528
01:01:55,999 --> 01:02:01,069
also a Kara is actually so funny the way

1529
01:01:58,579 --> 01:02:03,319

Qasim's okay that's going deep yeah I

1537
01:02:19,329 --> 01:02:27,469

01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:28,279
YouTube no Qasim is so he's so good that

1539
01:02:27,469 --> 01:02:32,890

01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:38,209
grandfather's kind of of YouTube in a

1542
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:41,059
way you guys have been here for so long

1543
01:02:38,209 --> 01:02:43,999
we're dying you dying literally a dying

1544
01:02:41,059 --> 01:02:46,910
breed though sketch comedy how um what

1545
01:02:43,999 --> 01:02:50,059

1546
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:51,380
interactions that you've had what does

1547
01:02:50,059 --> 01:02:53,479
this one always come up with every

1548
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:56,119
person well it's because I'm asking that

1549
01:02:53,479 --> 01:02:58,459
what oh yeah I'll let Ian go because

1550
01:02:56,119 --> 01:03:00,319
wherever we already answered this yeah I

1551
01:02:58,459 --> 01:03:03,680
mean the weird one that we always say it

1552
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:08,180
was a time when back when Anthony and I

1553
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:10,549
lived at the same house the address got

1554
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:13,839
leaked and people started showing up at

1555
01:03:10,549 --> 01:03:19,729
our house like on a almost daily basis

1556
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:20,930
and somebody somebody decided like in

1557
01:03:19,729 --> 01:03:23,180
the middle of the night that they were

1558
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:26,119
gonna go into the side of the house like

1559
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:27,469
through a fence uh-huh and they took a

1560
01:03:26,119 --> 01:03:30,049
picture of Anthony through the window

1561
01:03:27,469 --> 01:03:33,319
that is so weird

1562
01:03:30,049 --> 01:03:35,089
yeah that's cool I actually have a

1563
01:03:33,319 --> 01:03:36,999
similar one to that I didn't tell it I

1564
01:03:35,089 --> 01:03:39,170
don't know I didn't tell this story but

1565
01:03:36,999 --> 01:03:40,789
similar same thing somebody I mean

1566
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:45,709
people found out where I lived my other

1567
01:03:40,789 --> 01:03:47,869
place and I had cameras though and I

1568
01:03:45,709 --> 01:03:49,670
just so happened to have my TV on that

1569
01:03:47,869 --> 01:03:51,589
has a different cameras and I just see

1570
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:53,809
these kids like just I might you know

1571
01:03:51,589 --> 01:03:55,999
not not doing any of my front like kind

1572
01:03:53,809 --> 01:03:57,829
of garage area my on my driveway so

1573
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:59,569
you're not really like trespassing but

1574
01:03:57,829 --> 01:04:01,009
then I just keep watching them and then

1575
01:03:59,569 --> 01:04:02,599
you just see them talking and you see

1576
01:04:01,009 --> 01:04:04,249
this one kid go over and he runs up the

1577
01:04:02,599 --> 01:04:06,260
stairs looked in the window and he

1578
01:04:04,249 --> 01:04:08,240
starts filming inside

1579
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:09,619
yeah and then basically it's just like

1580
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:12,200
that's one of the main reasons why I

1581
01:04:09,619 --> 01:04:13,550
moved here because I was just like that

1582
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,780
was happening a lot at the other house

1583
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:18,109
once they find out where you live it's

1584
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:20,990
um it's very uncomfortable I always kept

1585
01:04:18,109 --> 01:04:24,430
my windows closed and you know it makes

1586
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:28,040
you feel weird man yeah I mean I

1587
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:30,470
wouldn't suggest everybody goes and go

1588
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:33,260
and do this but I mean I bought a gun

1589
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:34,040
yeah like oh you're gonna get so much

1590
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:36,710
hate yeah I know

1591
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:38,660
well it's look I I definitely don't

1592
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:39,650
recommend everybody go out in California

1593
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:41,480
yeah

1594
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:43,340
you can that oh I guess you have to just

1595
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:44,450
get a which one call right like you need

1596
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:47,600
some kind of license or something in

1597
01:04:44,450 --> 01:04:49,970
California with a shotgun no oh really

1598
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:52,040
always literally I paid 300 bucks and I

1599
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:53,359
had it in like two weeks or something

1600
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:54,740
like that you do like a background check

1601
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:57,080
or something but they do you don't need

1602
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:58,490
a permit for a shotgun or a handgun you

1603
01:04:57,080 --> 01:05:00,080
have to take like a written test a

1604
01:04:58,490 --> 01:05:03,590
concealed weapon yeah and then no not a

1605
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:06,350
not a concealed for a handgun yeah just

1606
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:09,140
for at least back when I was thinking

1607
01:05:06,350 --> 01:05:10,609
about it oh you had to take a test like

1608
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:13,130
a written test and then you had a permit

1609
01:05:10,609 --> 01:05:18,710
that expired like a couple years later

1610
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:20,420
right welcome to gun talk yeah and it's

1611
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:21,890
obviously I didn't I didn't have the

1612
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:24,740
intention of going out there and

1613
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:26,930
shooting fans but yeah well I mean it's

1614
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:29,359
its intended purpose if someone comes

1615
01:05:26,930 --> 01:05:30,890
and breaks into your house like you have

1616
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:34,220
some way to protect yourself if they

1617
01:05:30,890 --> 01:05:37,369
have a gun too you know yeah and like

1618
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:40,190
and that was my reason for the shotgun

1619
01:05:37,369 --> 01:05:43,369
over something like a handgun was the

1620
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:45,830
sound alone should be enough to scare

1621
01:05:43,369 --> 01:05:48,680
most people away unless you're like a

1622
01:05:45,830 --> 01:05:50,690
quasi murderer which is very rare you

1623
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:53,170
know if you're just somebody looking to

1624
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:55,880
break in and steal some equipment like

1625
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:57,890
you're not gonna take that risk so if

1626
01:05:55,880 --> 01:06:00,500
you just hear that then you're you're

1627
01:05:57,890 --> 01:06:01,460
not gonna stick around yeah I don't plan

1628
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,869
on shooting anybody

1629
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:04,640
I certainly don't want to shoot anybody

1630
01:06:02,869 --> 01:06:07,970
I don't fantasize about shooting anybody

1631
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:12,200
I think you know gun violence is

1632
01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:14,330
obviously a huge problem but yours I

1633
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:16,160
mean you have a you're a special Kate I

1634
01:06:14,330 --> 01:06:17,810
mean like not to make you feel like you

1635
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:19,760
know but I mean it's true like you

1636
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:22,670
there's a very legitimate reason as

1637
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:24,470
- why you have that gun yeah and it's

1638
01:06:22,670 --> 01:06:25,640
not for fans that are that are trying to

1639
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:27,560
take pictures through my window it's

1640
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:29,330
it's it's the fact that you know our

1641
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:31,190
address is out there it only takes one

1642
01:06:29,330 --> 01:06:32,240
person to say well they're youtubers I

1643
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:34,880
bet they have some pretty expensive

1644
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:36,560
video and audio equipment or one crazy

1645
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:38,540
person that's all it takes

1646
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:40,460
yeah I mean I've never banked on the

1647
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:43,100
crazy person aspect of it but it did

1648
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:46,250
happen it did happen to Gavin and make

1649
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:48,260
turn I know yeah and that that was scary

1650
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:50,270
as hell cuz that's that's sort of the

1651
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:53,300
thing that every sort of youtuber feared

1652
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:55,700
and and you know thank god they're okay

1653
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:57,170
you know like that one crazy that's what

1654
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:58,790
I mean though there's so many people in

1655
01:06:57,170 --> 01:07:01,250
the world and because people know you

1656
01:06:58,790 --> 01:07:03,020
there's a higher probability of someone

1657
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:05,660
crazy coming and doing something that

1658
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:07,400
yet and I mean obviously the the girls

1659
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:10,970
online have to worry about that a little

1660
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:12,530
bit more yeah sure oh yeah there was

1661
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:14,090
there's some there's some youtuber that

1662
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:17,180
was telling a person so this is gonna be

1663
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:19,820
a third person story but they said that

1664
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:24,350
they had a there this guy reached out

1665
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:28,220
out to out to her it was a fan and he's

1666
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:30,650
like hey um I'm just making sure you

1667
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:34,040
haven't been talking directly to me have

1668
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:36,290
you and she she was like no and he's

1669
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:40,100
like okay thank you because I have this

1670
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:41,450
mental condition where I watch when I'm

1671
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:46,040
watching something I think they're

1672
01:07:41,450 --> 01:07:48,710
talking directly to me what yeah so so

1673
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:51,530
he had the wherewithal to realize that

1674
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:54,140
because of this you know mental illness

1675
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:56,960
that he could not be possibly thinking

1676
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:59,030
straight yeah but it's those it's that

1677
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:01,130
possible that's a fortunate scenario

1678
01:07:59,030 --> 01:08:02,750
that is very easily with a very people

1679
01:08:01,130 --> 01:08:05,300
who are self aware of that yeah you know

1680
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:07,450
yeah and then and then it's those kinds

1681
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:09,680
of people not that I'm trying to like

1682
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:11,060
say a certain type of like mental

1683
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:13,520
illness is responsible right this is

1684
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:15,140
anything but the people that aren't

1685
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:18,980
right in the head that you know the guy

1686
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:22,190
that broke in there was obsessed with

1687
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:24,020
Meg right like had thousands of notes on

1688
01:08:22,190 --> 01:08:26,060
his phone about like his love for her

1689
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:30,560
and like how he was gonna kill Gavin or

1690
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:32,690
whatever it was nuts yeah and you know

1691
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,520
obviously it's not like something that

1692
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:36,620
youtubers should be worried about every

1693
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:38,060
moment of the day but yeah but just you

1694
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:39,770
know being aware of something like that

1695
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:42,529
yeah see the thing is the way that I

1696
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:44,089
justify that that you know I know that

1697
01:08:42,529 --> 01:08:45,859
already people are gonna be like oh I

1698
01:08:44,089 --> 01:08:47,330
can't believe Ian has a go what and

1699
01:08:45,859 --> 01:08:49,159
there's gonna be people regardless

1700
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:50,690
because we shot a video where we

1701
01:08:49,159 --> 01:08:52,040
literally just went to the desert and

1702
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:54,020
shotguns yeah that's I think you do out

1703
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:55,819
here I didn't think much of it and we

1704
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:59,270
got so much ridiculous hate for that I'm

1705
01:08:55,819 --> 01:09:01,850
sure but the thing is about the whole

1706
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:04,790
situation and your situation and why I

1707
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:07,100
think it's fine is because if everybody

1708
01:09:04,790 --> 01:09:08,810
didn't have guns that there was no guns

1709
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:10,429
yeah of course well you don't need a gun

1710
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:11,810
even though it's alright

1711
01:09:10,429 --> 01:09:14,779
you know if but the fact that you don't

1712
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:17,120
that's not put into place you know like

1713
01:09:14,779 --> 01:09:23,179
that's you need I mean I understand your

1714
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:25,429
concern for that yeah I mean I my I have

1715
01:09:23,179 --> 01:09:27,469
no black or white thoughts I think

1716
01:09:25,429 --> 01:09:29,299
that's that's the issue with with you

1717
01:09:27,469 --> 01:09:31,759
know any sort of gun control debate is

1718
01:09:29,299 --> 01:09:33,889
it so black and white of like you're

1719
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:36,230
either for guns or against guns and I'm

1720
01:09:33,889 --> 01:09:38,779
like I mean there's certain cases where

1721
01:09:36,230 --> 01:09:40,400
like maybe it's it's alright but like

1722
01:09:38,779 --> 01:09:42,100
there's also a lot of people that

1723
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:44,750
definitely should not have guns and

1724
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:47,060
maybe there are just too many guns

1725
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:48,650
yeah well the original reason was for

1726
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:50,029
tourney right like that's the reason why

1727
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:52,730
that a Second Amendment

1728
01:09:50,029 --> 01:09:55,429
sure yeah but we all had single fire

1729
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:57,199
muskets like two minutes not that we

1730
01:09:55,429 --> 01:09:59,030
need to not that we need to get into any

1731
01:09:57,199 --> 01:10:01,190
gun control talk because that's really

1732
01:09:59,030 --> 01:10:05,360
not an interest among the concert people

1733
01:10:01,190 --> 01:10:10,250
like yeah I know but um yeah that's

1734
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:11,600
that's that's cool of you to admit it's

1735
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:12,949
in that same and that's also kind of the

1736
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:15,800
funny I always think about this with

1737
01:10:12,949 --> 01:10:17,690
like there is like a lot of people hood

1738
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:20,150
you know from an outsider perspective

1739
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:25,790
like everyone thinks California is like

1740
01:10:20,150 --> 01:10:28,820
this you know super liberal Democrat gun

1741
01:10:25,790 --> 01:10:29,920
control hellhole it's like well I know a

1742
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:33,050
lot of people you could basically

1743
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:35,600
classify as rednecks like uh-huh like

1744
01:10:33,050 --> 01:10:38,690
California is a very diverse sort of

1745
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:40,610
state and I mean we're you know a lot of

1746
01:10:38,690 --> 01:10:42,830
us are descendants of pioneers people

1747
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:46,789
that traveled across the frickin country

1748
01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:49,039
in a wagon and wrist you know life and

1749
01:10:46,789 --> 01:10:51,440
to come out here and you know there's

1750
01:10:49,039 --> 01:10:55,429
still a lot of that sort of like you

1751
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:59,210
know rugged sort of lifestyle that that

1752
01:10:55,429 --> 01:11:02,059
exists I mean there's there's like like

1753
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:05,389
a more like way Northern California they

1754
01:11:02,059 --> 01:11:07,250
tried to secede ya know they try to form

1755
01:11:05,389 --> 01:11:08,960
their own state north California

1756
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:10,340
it's called know there were sorry there

1757
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:12,769
was gonna be three right well no this is

1758
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:15,050
early as it was called the state of

1759
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:16,849
Jefferson oh I didn't know that yeah and

1760
01:11:15,050 --> 01:11:19,489
it's like a little bit of Oregon and

1761
01:11:16,849 --> 01:11:21,769
then and then like like northern

1762
01:11:19,489 --> 01:11:24,559
Northern California huh and yeah they

1763
01:11:21,769 --> 01:11:26,840
just they didn't like how things were

1764
01:11:24,559 --> 01:11:28,699
and they wanted their own state whatever

1765
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:32,119
happened to the separating California to

1766
01:11:28,699 --> 01:11:33,260
three parts that I think the courts the

1767
01:11:32,119 --> 01:11:35,690
courts knocked it down

1768
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:38,869
no so it showed up in our it showed up

1769
01:11:35,690 --> 01:11:41,000
in our voting yeah but it said like the

1770
01:11:38,869 --> 01:11:44,719
Supreme Court of California or something

1771
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:46,699
has like voted out yeah so it wasn't on

1772
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:50,119
the ballot it was such a stupid idea

1773
01:11:46,699 --> 01:11:52,070
anyway like I mean I didn't know enough

1774
01:11:50,119 --> 01:11:54,230
about it to comment but I just remember

1775
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:57,280
I was like Oh more states to remember

1776
01:11:54,230 --> 01:12:00,949
yeah you know sucks for kids yeah

1777
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:02,809

learn about now and Guam and all this

1779
01:12:02,809 --> 01:12:08,389
stuff I mean as maniacs would have to

1780
01:12:06,199 --> 01:12:11,300
change their song yeah it is kind of

1781
01:12:08,389 --> 01:12:13,820
weird though that California is one

1782
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:17,000
state but there's what 40 million people

1783
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:19,070
that live in one state such a big sock

1784
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:21,199
it's like two-thirds of the East Coast

1785
01:12:19,070 --> 01:12:21,679
or something like the size of it west

1786
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:24,170
coast

1787
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:28,340
no it's the same oh yeah two-thirds of

1788
01:12:24,170 --> 01:12:30,440
like I don't know it's huge yeah yeah I

1789
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:33,739
don't know Alaska's 3 times the size of

1790
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:36,710
Texas I do know that yeah Paco's coming

1791
01:12:33,739 --> 01:12:38,090

memes boy I just love whatever there's

1795
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:45,289
like an asteroid they're always like

1796
01:12:42,739 --> 01:12:48,610
it's twice the size of Texas or like

1797
01:12:45,289 --> 01:12:50,320
three times the size of Great Britain

1798
01:12:48,610 --> 01:12:51,730
I mean it's a unit of measurement for us

1799
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:54,130
you know I guess so we wouldn't

1800
01:12:51,730 --> 01:12:55,540
understand in cubic meters or somebody

1801
01:12:54,130 --> 01:12:59,170
with no I mean yeah if someone is like

1802
01:12:55,540 --> 01:13:01,059
it's 5,000 inches how does it and then

1803
01:12:59,170 --> 01:13:02,440
you convert it to feet it's not as

1804
01:13:01,059 --> 01:13:04,090
impressed let that be easier for us and

1805
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:07,989
like meters because we're not on the

1806
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:09,909
metric system that don't you haha wait

1807
01:13:07,989 --> 01:13:11,770
this topic got like very serious and

1808
01:13:09,909 --> 01:13:14,320
dark towards the N huh yeah that's how I

1809
01:13:11,770 --> 01:13:16,090
like to take things now that's good rope

1810
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:18,309
you in with the light fluffy things and

1811
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:19,929
then I'll just tear your heart out and

1812
01:13:18,309 --> 01:13:21,219
then we talk about gun control and now

1813
01:13:19,929 --> 01:13:25,480
that's every what everyone's gonna be

1814
01:13:21,219 --> 01:13:27,130
talking about unless we talk unless we

1815
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:28,960
bring up something I don't know but I

1816
01:13:27,130 --> 01:13:30,550
think it's we don't really we always end

1817
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:33,040
up bringing some political thing in here

1818
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:34,920
but what my original intention is to

1819
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:37,360
talk about things I'm interested in

1820
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:39,760
obviously what the guest if there's a

1821
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:41,380
guest what they're interested in - and I

1822
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:43,389
guess I am interested in politics kid

1823
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:43,960
always comes up at least once a podcast

1824
01:13:43,389 --> 01:13:45,880
yeah

1825
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:47,050
but um you're talking about life and

1826
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:48,610
life is politics

1827
01:13:47,050 --> 01:13:51,579
and I but the thing is I'm not the most

1828
01:13:48,610 --> 01:13:55,349
educated person on this stuff but I have

1829
01:13:51,579 --> 01:13:59,610

1861
01:15:18,010 --> 01:15:21,520
whole tour of podcast that I said I was

1862
01:15:19,990 --> 01:15:23,770
gonna do eventually at some point and

1863
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:26,500
I'm just gonna try and knock them all

1864
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:29,290
out at once well if you come if you come

1865
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:32,590
uh to do the podcast with us you

1866
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:35,380
probably do redlynx yeah yeah and then I

1867
01:15:32,590 --> 01:15:38,170
was supposed to do actually I really did

1868
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:39,850
reach out a while back but I was I just

1869
01:15:38,170 --> 01:15:42,010
I don't know what happened with that h3

1870
01:15:39,850 --> 01:15:43,330
I'm supposed to their podcast as well I

1871
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:45,520
don't know why but will told me to be

1872
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:47,590
worried about that one cuz they're there

1873
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:48,580
uh I guess if you mess up saying

1874
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:51,220
something I don't know have you done

1875
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:53,170
theirs yeah oh yeah why does it wear it

1876
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:54,670
wears them I don't think there's

1877
01:15:53,170 --> 01:15:57,070
anything to be worried about I mean the

1878
01:15:54,670 --> 01:16:00,280
audience is is pretty critical

1879
01:15:57,070 --> 01:16:03,100
yeah but podcast is fun Ethan's great

1880
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:06,400
guy yeah yeah so I I mean I don't know

1881
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:08,530

01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:12,370

1885
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:18,370
you're putting the podcast on their

1886
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:20,440

1887
01:16:18,370 --> 01:16:22,660
smosh smosh passes on a separate channel

1888
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:24,730

1889
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:26,950
point i will be on as well yeah hell

1890
01:16:24,730 --> 01:16:28,690
yeah that being said we didn't tell them

1891
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:30,460
how we end this but you know what we're

1892
01:16:28,690 --> 01:16:34,420
just gonna know but he's watched it he's

1893
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:36,220
watched it we can see the ending is

1894
01:16:34,420 --> 01:16:40,030
basically how we ended we just get naked

1895
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:41,860
you fail yeah you first you don't see

1896
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:44,110
what I got trust me all we do is we

1897
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:45,790
breathe into the mic oh good yeah it's

1898
01:16:44,110 --> 01:16:47,110
just it's not good for the mics I don't

1899
01:16:45,790 --> 01:16:49,060
know why we do it it's probably gonna

1900
01:16:47,110 --> 01:16:51,100
break at some point but it's just been

1901
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:54,460
our thing i I've been ending my podcast

1902
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:56,050
going that's pretty close to be honest

1903
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:57,670
it's just an annoying noise there's a

1904
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:58,570
lot no this is some more right there

1905
01:16:57,670 --> 01:17:00,700

1917
01:17:27,130 --> 01:17:30,010
pill on Twitter and all the other

1918
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:31,690
podcasts on Instagram so that you can

1919
01:17:30,010 --> 01:17:40,750
get your questions in with that being

1920
01:17:31,690 --> 01:17:42,430
said see you guys next time I wonder how

1921
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:44,530
that Mike's like this probably as a

1922
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:46,060
consistent like sugar-free Red Bulls

1923
01:17:44,530 --> 01:17:47,230
like kind of so yeah that kind of smell

1924
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:48,760
that yours probably has a kind of

1925
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:50,500
interesting smell but this one is

1926
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:52,230
probably like a mix of so many different

1927
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:57,400
smells Jelly Belly popcorn

1928
01:17:52,230 --> 01:17:57,400
[Laughter]
