by naming our program schizo News live

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,890
it would have the abbreviation SNL which

16
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,470

22
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,960
realize that by naming our station

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,760
channel 6 that we'd have a 666 in our

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,710
set which some people believe to be a

25
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,930
demonic number also related to the

00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:10,240
people that's a bunch of illumine on

28
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:11,770
sense and also because we're not going

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,300
to change the entire set because I'm a

30
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:18,160
