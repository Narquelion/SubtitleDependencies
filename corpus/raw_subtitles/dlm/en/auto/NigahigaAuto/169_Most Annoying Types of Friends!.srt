00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,449
hey guys so today I'm gonna be talking

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:04,740
about the most annoying types of friends

3
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:06,330
and I know that sounds really bad

4
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,859
because you aren't calling your friends

5
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,059
annoying let's be real for a second

6
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:10,650
every single friend of yours probably

7
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,240
does at least one thing that annoys you

8
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,469
but you just look past it because well

9
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,940
if they're your friend either that or

10
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:17,430
you haven't been friends long enough to

11
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,800
see those traits come out or well you

12
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,730
don't have any friends you would know a

13
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,380
lot about that huh

14
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,730
what you act like you have friends what

15
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,810

16
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,460
yeah and that's why you're talking to me

17
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,840
right now you talked to me first that's

18
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,449
why I'm talking to you yeah but

19
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,579
technically I am you so you talked to

20
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,840
you first why are you here I'm annoying

21
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,030
right and I'm here to help you with this

22
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,410
video since you have no friends yeah but

23
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,730
you only have season two look if you're

24
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,290
gonna help can you at least wait till we

25
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,790
get to the examples I'm sorry I thought

26
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,140
we already started is this not the first

27
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:48,210
example is it's not the whiny annoying

28
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,950
vlogger friend anyway as I was saying

29
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,390
until I still rudely interrupted myself

30
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,680
I love my friends I'm sure you guys love

31
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,539
all of yours that's why we call them

32
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,070
friends but there's no such thing as a

33
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,539
friend that's never annoying there's

34
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,800
just friends that are significantly less

35
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,120
annoying than others and today we're

36
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,800
gonna be talking about those others here

37
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,160
are the most annoying types of friends

38
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,160
take a look

39
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,580
this is one of the most relatable common

40
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,229
ones there is the baler we all have that

41
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,520
one friend who says they're always down

42
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:12,990
to do stuff and then they make plans

43
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,250
with you and at the very last second

44
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,960
they tell you that they can't go or they

45
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,430
bail hence the baler hey Greg do you

46
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,090
want to go to the gym a little bit yeah

47
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:23,009
let me just get ready all right I'm good

48
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,690

49
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,360
anymore I can't make you have a doctor's

50
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:29,220
thing appointment conference the judger

51
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,930
just like it says in title this is the

52
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,490
friend that literally judges you for

53
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,259
everything that you do I see you and me

54
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,550
like seriously you're gonna wear that on

55
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,360
a date what's wrong with it I mean it's

56
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,360
cool I mean it looks a little

57
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,679
polka-dotty though you shouldn't have be

58
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,390
heating those those are so bad for you

59
00:01:42,679 --> 00:01:48,960
wait are you liking her photo you just

60
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,460
met her that's so desperate the

61
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,690
passive-aggressive friend this is one of

62
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,700
the most annoying types of friends in my

63
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:54,929
opinion they never ever tell you exactly

64
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,429
what they want to say or what they want

65
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:57,960
to do it just hint at it so that you

66
00:01:56,429 --> 00:01:59,880
don't believe the bad guy and they put

67
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,819
it on you all right so who's driving I

68
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,159
can't cuz my car's in the shop so I can

69
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:06,450
I can I I did drink a little so I mean

70
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,039
like if you don't mind riding a little

71
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,750
bit drunk it's fine oh I do have shoe

72
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,829
boxes in the back that's kind of taking

73
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,000
up some space so they'd probably be

74
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:13,230
really uncomfortable for three people

75
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,400
but it's cool because I can just throw

76
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,260
my shoes on in the trash I don't need

77
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,489
them I mean I don't need shoes I cannot

78
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,140
have this as lepers even though it's

79
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:20,459
really not safe for my workplace you

80
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,600
know as long as you just don't block my

81
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:22,769
rearview mirror because you know I can't

82
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,090
see at night and I can't drive

83
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:26,459
oh it's Dave I can't see during the day

84
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,079
very well okay fine I'll try to I can

85
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,180
drive no it's it's fine I mean I can

86
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:31,950
drive as long as you drive okay let's

87
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,380
just go sure if that's what you want to

88
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,970
do the liger again another common one I

89
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,500
mean these friends pretty much speak a

90
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,030
different language when it comes to time

91
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,620
just have to translate it for example

92
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,970
agar says that they're leaving soon it

93
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,019
means they haven't even started to get

94
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,090
rid of it when they say they're on my

95
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,769
way that means I'm on my way to get

96
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,180
ready but I'm still 30 minutes from

97
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:49,440
leaving when they say I'm here that

98
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,970
means they're five to ten minutes away

99
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,230
and then when the liger says I can't

100
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,760
seem to find you where are you that

101
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,410
means they literally just showed up at

102
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,820
that second the overly sensitive friend

103
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,799
this is the friend that takes every

104
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,700
little thing so personally that you get

105
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:01,079
to the point where you have to be

106
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,160
careful what you say around them and

107
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:05,010
what you do around them because you

108
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:08,970
don't want to offend them oh wow what

109
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:10,950

when a hot girl or a guy comes along

125
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,650
this is the friend that just changes

126
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,730
after them they disappear and completely

127
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:51,310
seem to forget about you and your

128
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:52,570
friends the photographer I guess this

129
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,010
one isn't really annoying to a lot of

130
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,420
you guys but this is really annoying to

131
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,800
me this is the person that has to take a

132
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,060
picture of every single little thing

133
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,710
that you and your friends do to them

134
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:13,870
then needs to be broadcasted or it

135
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:14,980
didn't happen the cheap friend this is

136
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:18,790
the one friend in the group that never

137
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:23,260
pays for anything okay I'll be right

138
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:24,280
back I got a all right and your friend

139
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,850
over there said you guys are paying

140
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,990
together the overly competitive friend

141
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,460
this is the rent you never want to play

142
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:35,740
games with because they always get way

143
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:37,660
too competitive oh you just hit it just

144
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,650
hit the ball like are you serious no

145
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,180
let's go I mean like if you want to

146
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,550
handicap you can get help take it easy

147
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,960
man it's cool it's your turn go ahead

148
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,580
just go ahead you need the help so I

149
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,070
hope you need to play by the rules even

150
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:50,169
by your own your dumbass roses fine the

151
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,280
check out this video friend I need a

152
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:52,600
better title for though this is the one

153
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,220
friend that always wants to show you a

154
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,500
video that he or she thinks is so funny

155
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,750
or cool or awesome even though they're

156
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:02,400
not that funny or cool or awesome you

157
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:04,540
see that twist so good right right right

158
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,400
right

159
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,110
the overly honest friend and last but

160
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,160
not least you never want a lying friend

161
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,780
that's like one of the top things you

162
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,640
don't want in a friend but sometimes the

163
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,320
overly honest friend can actually be a

164
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:18,750
lot more annoying for example see that

165
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:22,360
twist so good right right right right

166
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:24,230
this video sucked oh because sometimes

167
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,180
it's better to lie to a friend than to

168
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:31,190
actually hurt them this video sucked oh

169
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:34,520
but I guess there's a good ending to it

170
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:35,960
and it doesn't end awkwardly and again I

171
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,460
didn't make this video to call friends

172
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,690
of mine nor do I think you should send

173
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,310
this to your annoying friends because

174
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,660
that'll probably result in you know you

175
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,040
having less friends it's actually the

176
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,900
opposite when I made this list I

177
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,070
actually realized that I do a lot of

178
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,120
these annoying trees I mean when you

179
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,680
watch this video I'm sure you guys

180
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,670
pinpoint in which one of your friends is

181
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,080
this and which one of your friends is

182
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:52,280

183
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,450
ourselves you haven't already you should

184
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,590
rewatch this video and instead of

185
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,420
thinking about all your different

186
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,680
friends that these apply to think about

187
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,480
yourselves if there's something a friend

188
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,800
does that really annoys you chances are

189
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,060
you do something that really annoys that

190
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,680
friend as well because there's no such

191
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,450
thing as a perfect friend which also

192
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,740
means that you're not the perfect friend

193
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,210
either in order to preserve that

194
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,920
friendship we have to learn to just

195
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,050
accept these annoying traits and realize

196
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,420
that no friend yeah how would you know
