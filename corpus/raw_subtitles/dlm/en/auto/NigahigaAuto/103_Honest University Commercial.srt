Johnny some definitely in debt chances

39
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,080
are you will need a loan to be able to

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,610
afford a bra but don't worry you don't

41
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,340
have to pay it back until right after

42
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,000
you graduate that's a lot of time

43
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,409
because if you thought you were gonna
