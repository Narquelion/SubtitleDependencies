not the whole twin no have you have you

52
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,590

56
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:22,709
yeah that's super weird yeah yeah like

57
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:24,000
if it's so weird I think like my brother

58
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,340
and I are attracted to the same sort of

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,810
person I think my god there was a girl

60
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,129
that I was like that was on my Instagram

61
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,110
and I must like this chicks really

62
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:32,790
really you know really hot and then

63
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,959
Michael texted a girl that I was like

64
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,569
who's that cool she's really really hot

65
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:39,329
so I think you guys are very similar

66
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:41,430
obviously I guess so yeah maybe what's

67
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:44,040
the biggest differences uh he's more of

68
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:46,950
like an athlete bully sort of dude he's

69
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,109

00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,889
script that's pretty absolutely yeah

183
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,539
absolutely

184
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:44,020
that's so crazy like we sold a TV show

185
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:45,520
back in Australia and then our um the

186
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,289
network that purchased that just didn't

187
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,639
like do anything with it like we've

188
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:49,840
finished it we had like the Bible in the

189
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,699
pilot that like yep we're gonna finance

190
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,020
it and then I was like I get one can we

191
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:54,310
write the second episode and it was just

192
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,259
the thing where we never heard from them

193
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:58,240
mmm so I think they bought it just to

194
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:58,930
have it and not do it or something oh

195
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,000
that's weird

196
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:02,669
yeah it was really trash yeah well I

197
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,139
mean you guys do a lot of like you've

198
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:06,430
other than the crazy things you guys do

199
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:09,340
like crazy effects and you do a lot of

200
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:12,789
like scripted material and yeah are you

201
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:15,520
the editor or yes I like irons yes me my

202
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:16,689
brother say I'll like think of what the

203
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,189
idea is usually in a more like

204
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:20,169
improvised on set or have a script

205
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:22,029
mm-hmm and then so he'll star on it I'll

206
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:23,529
shoot it and then I'll do like a rough

207
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:24,969
cut he'll do a fine cut and he will do a

208
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:26,379
color grade I'll do it the color grading

209
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:28,330
you'll do sound effects of music mm-hmm

210
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,770
yeah we split it up and then we've got

211
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,500
like a VFX team if it gets really really

212
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:34,120
heavy you know how big is your full crew

213
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,379
then well I don't know it like it

214
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,029
depends on the project like sometimes

215
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:39,069
it'd just be Michael and me and then

216
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:41,259
other times it could be like 15 people

217
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:42,580
so just oranges you do then yeah the

218
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:43,900
core is just us - yeah and then we're

219
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,190
like a stunt coordinator for the biggest

220
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,810
stuff as well so if you want to do wild

221
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:48,639
work or like car crashes and lots of

222
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:51,310
stuff we get in like a part that's all

223
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,159
in Adelaide yeah all in Adelaide always

224
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,719
never late yeah we are watching that a

225
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:57,129
clip of you guys kind of just like nice

226
00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:59,139
and by a cornfield or something you guys

227
00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:02,050
are just kept jumping on to windshields

228
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:04,810
and just doing all right yeah yeah do

229
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:06,009
you think the fact that you were raised

230
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,110
in Adelaide and there's like really

231
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:10,000
nothing to do it's a smaller town

232
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:11,770
there's so much space that you're kind

233
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,599
of like let's utilize this and it was

234
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:17,289
like I think what is really aggressive

235
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,610
children like a large city you probably

236
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:20,289
wouldn't like it we still would have

237
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,120
like done the same sort of thing it was

238
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:23,319
always like yeah well always those kids

239
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,689
that your parents wouldn't let you play

240
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:29,050
with you know like yeah you were the

241
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:32,169
kids we were those kids hang out with

242
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,849
those can you describe your your parents

243
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:36,339
like what are they like like pretty

244
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:37,990
laid-back like my dad was just never

245
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:40,209
home like he was always working so we'd

246
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,919
always entertain ourselves and then like

247
00:08:40,209 --> 00:08:43,419
we had our grandfather that lived with

248
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,820
my dad that was looking after us then he

249
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:48,010
passed away more 13 and then so like

250
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,510
yeah we saw our mum every now and then

251
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:51,790
but we provide daddy was just never home

252
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,660
so we always just you know get rapport

253
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,220
stuff yeah

254
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,960
yes report we will board we have to

255
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,580
express ourselves I mean what did they

256
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,620
say when they see these videos though

257
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,660
like they must say something right boy

258
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,770
yeah like originally I doubt I think it

259
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:06,690
was trying to get us to get a normal job

260
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:06,690
but then lice is not started picking up

261
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:13,120
have you guys ever had a normal job

262
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:15,010
no I'll so like for me to make money

263
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,480
yeah I was like checking into medical

264
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:19,000
trials and testing drugs that were on

265
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,350
the market oh my gosh yeah and so like

266
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,600
that was my jokes I can't really do

267
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:23,860
anything else how much do they pay no I

268
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,930
wasn't very good it was like probably

269
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,670
like 180 bucks a day or something and

270
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:29,470
they wouldn't they they take your blood

271
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,790
or they inject stuff in yeah yeah so it

272
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,290
depends on what the drug is like you

273
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,820
check into the hospital for like a month

274
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:35,290
at a time or two months and then they're

275
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:43,030
like alright we're gonna test this out

276
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:45,220
we've tested on rats but that did that

277
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:46,600
kind of thing I guess it has to exist

278
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,340
somewhere in real life so you've

279
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,440
actually done it yeah anything like

280
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,880
anything crazy yeah so like at one time

281
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,500
they like it was like a drip though

282
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,390
drifting the drug into my arm and then

283
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,400
it was hurting and I was like oh [ __ ]

284
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,450
this is hurting like you want us to stop

285
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,830
no no it's fine

286
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,360
and then I just kept heard and kept her

287
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:03,700
and I could feel it [ __ ] you know

288
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,140
going through me and then my entire left

289
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,910
arm just went paralyzed and I couldn't

290
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:09,190
move it and I was like I can't be mom

291
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:13,960
but what do you mean I can't be mom like

292
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:15,310
Tran squeezed my finger like a cod [ __ ]

293
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,840
and then once they sort of took it out

294
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:19,630
in the drug sort of wore off like I had

295
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,010
yeah they tell you what it was yeah they

296
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:23,890
tell me about I did so many of them I

297
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:26,230
said what they'll say is so crazy

298
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:27,400
yeah that's a very cool first job yeah

299
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,560
it was an awesome job

300
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,180
how about first job that I was in a VFX

301
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,130
house when I was 16 but I got fired like

302
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,450
two weeks in oh yeah I was terrible the

303
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,890
job I don't know I think I'm just

304
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,090
terrible at holding a normal job I just

305
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,170
couldn't do it like I imagine if you

306
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:41,140
weren't doing the videos are doing these

307
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:42,670
stuff I'd be like yeah what the thing is

308
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,890
it's hard to go I think it would be hard

309
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:46,780
to go back to a normal job but maybe if

310
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,460
I never had done it maybe I don't know I

311
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:50,410
used to be very just like I'm gonna play

312
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:52,270
by the book and just you know graduate

a normal job in medicine or something

315
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,370
and yeah yeah and then now when I think

316
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,770
about it as like man I don't know how I

317
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:03,370

then

330
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:28,959
yeah like we've been doing us this for

331
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:30,970

arresting a crowned eleven and then we

336
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,330
started really hurting each other like

337
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:43,029
around 14 15 was it was it because you

338
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:45,399
guys were like just rough and aggressive

339
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:46,089
or was it because you guys disagreed on

340
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,709
things

341
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:49,540

00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,029
yourself yeah I think we would have a

362
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,430
billion views but YouTube keeps removing

363
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:41,529
up yes yeah yeah so you probably already

364
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:43,120
do but there what on private or there

365
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:46,029
just what I remove them there to say oh

366
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,079
really yeah it's too dangerous or well I

367
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:48,520
don't know it depends on the video that

368
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:49,839
like this is too violent this was to

369
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,110
this this was to that and that started

370
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,730
happening for you oh I'm pretty pretty

371
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:56,050
early on but once that once the ad

372
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,089
pocalypse thing happened we were just

373
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,649
screwed like yeah adsense is just

374
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:01,779
nothing you know yeah like I made

375
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:03,250
nothing of had since and then like yeah

376
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:05,200
they just started removing and hiding

377
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,360
into monetizing and like it was just it

378
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,250
was hell so where's your form of revenue

379
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,390
coming in then well also like right now

380
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,550
it's like we live off brand it was

381
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:14,410
pretty much yeah and then say yeah

382
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,329
you're a patron or anything like that a

383
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:18,820
patron as well yeah yeah but like at the

384
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:20,019
main income would be produce so these

385
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,360
brand deals

386
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:25,540
I mean the the ad pocalypse it really

387
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,279
affected obviously the creators but it

388
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,660
was because the brands didn't want to

389
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,470
advertise on certain types of content

390
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,910
yeah

391
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:33,670
so when you guys are working on these

392
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:35,769
brand deals do they feel the same way

393
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:37,420
when they're working with like your you

394
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:39,220
know your type of content yeah I think

395
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,869
so there's like there are certain brands

396
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,069
that will advertise on our stuff and

397
00:13:40,869 --> 00:13:43,299
there's like two sites the rack rack I

398
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:45,459
like we have our violence side but we

399
00:13:43,299 --> 00:13:47,290
also have like the PG side as well and

400
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:50,110
there are lots of brands that want to

401
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:51,369
work on you know crazier content and

402
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,259
we've spoken to those brands and we've

403
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:54,670
spoken to like Google about it and like

404
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:56,319
that we've worked at brands with it like

405
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,279
you can't work with that brand like

406
00:13:56,319 --> 00:13:58,629
we're not letting that brands in our

407
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,739
platform and I'm like you're scaring off

408
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,929
the people that are gonna advertise for

409
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:04,319
mature content mm-hmm it's it's like

410
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:08,290
they just shoot themselves what types of

411
00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:10,779
brands would like like advertising yes

412
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:12,429
so like it I come so a lot of film and

413
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:14,290
TV stuff you like you know that TV show

414
00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:15,999
the boys that just came out like they're

415
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,679
they're keen to have like edgier content

416
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:19,899
more like stuff like Adam and Eve would

417
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:22,299
have edgy or content or you know like

418
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:23,559
people like that so like incident you

419
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:25,449
know what does it called VPNs and [ __ ]

420
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:26,589
like there are there are lots of brands

421
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:28,540
that will have that is down to do it

422
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:29,829
yeah if they want to do that the vile

423
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,049
stuff but then we also have the PG stuff

424
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:33,749
as well which we can do right altimeter

425
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:36,249
trying to it seems like you're trying to

426
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:39,339
take your career off YouTube right angle

427
00:14:36,249 --> 00:14:42,009
yeah mainstream movies yeah shows

428
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:44,139
exactly so doc 2018 were like I decided

429
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:45,579
I was like I was like I'm not fulfilled

430
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:47,949
anymore on YouTube I can't feel so

431
00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:49,480
restrictive in like hate it there you

432
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:49,990
know and that just being really there

433
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,299
are arseholes

434
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,799
yeah was it almost like in a way the

435
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:55,749
whole des monetizing of your channel

436
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:57,160
Thicke was it helpful actually to help

437
00:14:55,749 --> 00:14:59,279
you guys a jump because it's like man

438
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:02,559
this isn't worth it anymore yeah I guess

439
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:04,419
yeah I guess it's not a great thing yeah

440
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:05,740
but I could see how like you could you

441
00:15:04,419 --> 00:15:07,149
know I mean it's a scary thing to leave

442
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,709
your bread and butter right yeah exactly

443
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:10,660
for something else and then so it was

444
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:12,369
like we had wool riding a film before

445
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,869
that all happened and it was a thing

446
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,189
where we're so caught up with being

447
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:17,139
youtubers and traveling and doing this

448
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:18,790
doing that we never focused on it right

449
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:20,679
was like 2,080 knows I yeah I'm gonna

450
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:23,139
focus on it like this year and like from

451
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:24,970
now on you and then yeah so it worked

452
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:27,699
out apparently the movie could still be

453
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:29,799
crap it comes out I mean that's still

454
00:15:27,699 --> 00:15:31,360
pretty like I said it's you don't really

455
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:32,799

be some like money-hungry villain and he

488
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:33,350
video and say I was like I thought I had

489
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,760
two hours to wrap mine though yeah I'll

490
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:36,380
just play I'll play the villain but

491
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,120
you're more of the writer out of the two

492
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,710
right yeah we had five weeks for use

493
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,900
that team at two hours to write mine I

494
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:43,100
was like so I just sort of slept to give

495
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,180
her something really crafted I was like

496
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,420
I'll just play the villain I was like

497
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:49,310
rapping about beaches and money like

498
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:51,080
that's what like the whole thing was

499
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:52,850
about like as a joke but in my audience

500
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,130
like oh yeah Danny is like to sell out

501
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:56,750
Marco is the one that's dedicated to the

502
00:16:55,130 --> 00:17:00,190
original stuff but also that [ __ ] so

503
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,190
like everyone's against you right now

504
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:12,260
but he is a bully it sounds like you

505
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:13,520
guys have sibling rivalry yeah I guess

506
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,170
so a little bit all right this is the

507
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,750
first time he brought my car of the

508
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:20,120
video like he like I left the car back

509
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,740
in Australia that I do Drive and he took

510
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:25,970
it to my cousin's farm and blow it up

511
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:27,950
and I was like he blocked my car I was

512
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:29,300
like it's not necessarily done cold for

513
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:33,110
it makes no sense you seem so happy

514
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:35,210
about it it's using you're just a happy

515
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:40,790
person in a happy person yeah he blows

516
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:42,590
my car's pretty good it's like he blew

517
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:45,110

518
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:47,090

519
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:49,220

in that I got a friend to smear [ __ ] on

523
00:17:53,419 --> 00:18:01,909
his windshield and where was the [ __ ]

524
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:03,380
from my friends also you want to see

525
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:05,360
this stuff it may or may not be on

526
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,650
YouTube yeah as it may remove it they

527
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,490
didn't remove it and they really say

528
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:09,490
that they removed it

529
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,980
you can't put shootable windshield well

530
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,890
you brought my car what the [ __ ] is what

531
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:21,350
my old reaction from a blown-up car yeah

532
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,380
it's so small and then he's like stained

533
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,580
it like smells like [ __ ] permanently

534
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:29,149
take it to the wash a couple of times I

535
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:30,799
can't scrape off the char bone like my

536
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:32,059
car's completely totaled closer you guys

537
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,429
I mean obviously there's like this

538
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:36,140
rivalry and I'm sure a lot of it is for

539
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:38,929
YouTube right yeah but how close are you

540
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:40,220
guys like really are scenes well like we

541
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:42,380
don't really talk about anything other

542
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,820
than this stuff I mean like yeah yeah so

543
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,350
it's sort of like there's more business

544
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:49,840
I think it's more business I wouldn't

545
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:52,580
like have a bad day we should talk about

546
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,830
yeah I've been the case growing up yeah

547
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,409
I think so yeah must be is at some point

548
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:58,220
where we just sort of stopped being

549
00:18:56,409 --> 00:19:01,520
problems now we'll just like business

550
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:03,260
partners right yeah geez way as twins

551
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,559
you know you hear stories about twins

552
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:08,659
feeling certain things or like saying

553
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,130
things at the same time across the world

554
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:11,899
and you know those types of stories like

555
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:14,179
have you ever experienced any sort of

556
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:16,610
strange yes it's so like it's a weird

557
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:22,940
superpower like I if he needs to piss I

558
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:24,230
need to piss that's pretty good power so

559
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,309
that that was the one thing and then the

560
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,600
other thing is that yeah we sometimes

561
00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:29,690
would say the same things at the same

562
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,640
time yeah and like saying you know at

563
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:33,260
the same time just because you're just

564
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,370
so similar yeah I guess so

565
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,419
so like I don't know that they're the

566
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,740
two weird things that apart from that

567
00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:39,080
like I can't talk to him right now

568
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:41,120
without talking him on the phone like I

569
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,610
can't communicate with him no yeah yeah

570
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,110
but I wonder if like you know they they

571
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:46,279
used to do those weird experiments back

572
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,720
in the World War like Hitler dude

573
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:49,580
they're like oh we're gonna take twins

574
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,049
into submarines yeah take one into one

575
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,490
room one of the other and then kill one

576
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:54,500
and see if there's any reaction to the

577
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:56,450
other one hmm so like yeah I don't know

578
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,899
like maybe apparently those experiments

579
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:00,300
worked so I don't know oh I've heard of

580
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:03,080
that

581
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:05,610
yeah I know what the results were yeah

582
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:07,110
yeah should maybe do a video on that

583
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:19,230
that might be interesting yeah I think

584
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:23,580
mark would be shot the head just smear

585
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:28,740
[ __ ] on his face and know what yeah well

586
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:30,480
yeah he was angry well I guess since the

587
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:33,150
whole you know you're changing focus

588
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,340
from YouTube into doing your own script

589
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:37,290
yeah you guys kind of like branched out

590
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:39,630
and you guys started collabing a lot

591
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:41,310
more during that year ah no we we

592
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:43,470
clapping I think from the start like uh

593
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:44,730
like I think we have uh such as the

594
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:46,440
different starts what everyone was doing

595
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:48,990
so we were able to get some pretty big

596
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,430
collapse pretty quickly like like Logan

597
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:52,140
Pole and like Kay aside and that sort of

598
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:53,970
stuff like that they're keen to work

599
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,410
with us so like we got into those clubs

600
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,700
pretty quickly like after our first year

601
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:58,530
on YouTube we started clapping all these

602
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,780
people I actually wrote a script once

603
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:03,000

00:21:54,740 --> 00:22:00,020
I can't like say you this time you still

629
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,159
post normal videos along with the nut

630
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,210
this year I've actually been like taking

631
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:04,730
a break this I've been doing the podcast

632
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:06,140
yeah yeah cuz I was like just I mean you

633
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:07,399
know I mean you said the same thing

634
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:09,559
you've kind of felt like unfulfilled

635
00:22:07,399 --> 00:22:10,850
yeah yeah just got tiresome you know I

636
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:12,950
felt like I was making the same things

637
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,929
and like yeah get it like oh this will

638
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,490
get views cuz it's popular and you make

639
00:22:14,929 --> 00:22:20,720
something cool out of it but it's not

640
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:22,130
like it's not growth yeah yeah so for me

641
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,240
I mean I don't know if I don't know I'm

642
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:25,039
just putting words in your mouth but

643
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,450
that's all no no I completely uh yeah it

644
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,860
does feel repetitive and you do feel

645
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:29,960
like - doing the same thing yeah and

646
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,190
then when you repeat it like if I you've

647
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,029
done this before knowing you stray from

648
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:34,039
it I coulis

649
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:36,260
yeah told you you've changed exactly

650
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:37,070
yeah yeah I mean people for the longest

651
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,020
time because we started doing these

652
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:40,010
podcasts and so different from is the

653
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,770
first time I'm actually being myself

654
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:44,299
like on a-- yeah in first channel videos

655
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:45,890
and people were like alright why are you

656
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:47,059
so grouchy or like why are you why

657
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:48,289
you're not happy all the time like you

658
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:50,539
know like you know people just didn't

659
00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:53,059
know and I just got tired of just I

660
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:54,260
guess doing the same thing I think a

661
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:56,659
break figure you know but we're still

662
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,620
making other content yeah yeah but still

663
00:22:56,659 --> 00:23:01,190
trying to figure out what I want to do

664
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:04,370
it was nuts free it was pretty

665
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:05,630
exhausting dudes content just like that

666
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:08,299
though I know but you you were like

667
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:10,279
doing it weekly yeah for a little bit it

668
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:11,840
was like you were pretty consistent like

669
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:14,240
I would go between like two months about

670
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,309
uploading sometimes yeah yeah so props

671
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,140
to you I mean you guys did some like

672
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:21,860
your dinner uno video and when did that

673
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:25,159
come out oh that was 2016 I think yeah I

674
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:27,200
think when do we do ours before me so

675
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:28,610
yeah so it was a little before that I

676
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,990
was like oh this is pretty like we were

677
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:31,880
pretty happy with it and then yours came

678
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:35,360
out I was like okay well now ours is it

679
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:37,190
relevant like live-action and like ours

680
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,200
is just [ __ ] like what you guys did I

681
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,820
was like okay okay these guys are good

682
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:47,570
so you guys kept getting better so

683
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:49,399
there's a sec okay I don't wanna like

684
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:51,070
Ben's pretty dependable so yeah yeah

685
00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:54,380
there's probably something I missed

686
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:55,610
yeah yeah but talking about how you guys

687
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:58,070
are kind of like you know taking a break

688
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:59,690
and finding that compromise and stuff a

689
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:01,250
lot of times with artists they'll be

690
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:02,450
like oh I want to express my true self

691
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,500
but then it's like how do I make money

692
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:06,680
with that yeah

693
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,970
I think with you because like your

694
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,860
guys's videos are getting blocked or

695
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:11,570
hidden or sometimes monetized and it's

696
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,980
like why don't you just show less

697
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:14,930
violence and you guys are just like we

698
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,330
love violence though yeah well I think

699
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:18,680
that it was sort of like they were

700
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,730
hiding things that weren't even violent

701
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,350
like if it was like certain amount of

702
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:23,870
swear words I can that channel was just

703
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:25,670
targeted yeah you know and then I Mikael

704
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:27,970
of making non violent videos but they

705
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:29,180
were still striking us alike you know

706
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,590
yeah

707
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:32,030
changing our channel like like we

708
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:33,770
started doing vlogs for a beer and then

709
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:35,030
we started doing I don't know what we

710
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:37,100
ended up doing like we sort of lost that

711
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:38,420
way but I just have my oh we won't make

712
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,130
you what I wanted to make anymore so

713
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,810
yeah like that writing has been so

714
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:44,150
fulfilling it's been the best thing if I

715
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:45,890
can love a love writing is that it's I

716
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,910
love it so much now right and we're

717
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,260
still doing the big videos like we got

718
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,730
Harry Potter those Star Wars 2 coming

excited to do videos for YouTube but

725
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:02,060

so stupid to be upset I guess I have a

776
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,800
question did your brother also do the

777
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,510
drug testing thing no no it was just me

778
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:01,250
saying maybe that's why you're so

779
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:05,220
positive yeah I've got like a weird drug

780
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:07,080
lasting effect I had a friend that once

781
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,550
did the drug tests and they did it on

782
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,690
rats and they bought every one in a week

783
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:12,300
after they done the drugs they're like

784
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:14,880
we don't want to worry anyone but the

785
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:19,650
the rats that we tested the drug on some

786
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:21,810
of them have gone blind so like that was

787
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:23,850
like a really scary call so crazy yeah

788
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:26,490
you guys signed a waiver so yeah like

789
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:28,560
whatever happens happens yeah so crazy

790
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:29,940
once I turned yellow like a Simpson

791
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,800
because like something to do with my

792
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,990
liver like I was yeah yeah yeah yeah and

793
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:36,800
then once I was having spasms oh my gosh

798
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:54,390
thing like I do love going to the drugs

799
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,890

00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:57,180
was still doing YouTube videos when I

801
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,410

897
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:35,640
like I still saw them and hung out with

898
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,840
them and everything so like I I got

899
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,610
really good friends with them and always

900
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,740
spoke to them but it was just yeah

901
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:42,780
feelings were never the same so as we

902
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:47,040
pick at the scab and open up a L boom

903
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:48,780
yeah yeah I guess what was the turning

904
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:51,510
point where you're like this is not

905
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:53,010
gonna work well I was like um well I

906
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,150
started riding when I was upset so

907
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:56,490
there's a lot of that stuff in my

908
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:57,600
scripts so maybe that's why I got picked

909
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:59,700
up picked up because there's a lot of

910
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,040
like I felt really I guess authentic for

911
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,330
like for some area yeah like I said like

912
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,010
I want that stuff is in the script and

913
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:07,890
all sort of like therapy to ride it

914
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:10,200
you know and then also I was writing I

915
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:11,640
was writing songs a bit as well for some

916
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,380
artists like a bit of guys writing stuff

917
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,940
and it got to the point where I was like

918
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:16,560
picking fights as a person so I could

919
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:21,660
like get upset to write lyrics it was

920
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:25,680
just a weird toxic thing artists scripts

921
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:27,180
yeah but yeah like I'll even now the I

922
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,950
don't know it's just still like a really

923
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:31,620
weird thing you know well before this

924
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:31,980
crush that you had lasted X amount of

925
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:35,280
years

926
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:38,010
did you like while you tubers still did

927
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:41,220
you yes you have like a girlfriend later

928
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:43,260
yeah it was like I don't know playing

929
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:45,090
the field a bit I guess never never like

930
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,680
a proper girlfriend yeah yeah never

931
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:49,230
never that like it's always been that

932
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,220
you know messing around or maybe but

933
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:52,080
like it was never like I never had like

934
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:53,280
a proper proper relationship for anyone

935
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,710
are you ready for one

936
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:58,280
ah well no now I'm not now I'm like no

937
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:58,280
way yeah

938
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,180
good that's to painful it hurts too much

939
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:05,970
yeah it's like I mean but if the right

940
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:08,100
one came along yeah possibly like I yeah

941
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:09,420
ah today I'd rather not right now

942
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,470
it'd be a thing where I'm like maybe in

943
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,600
a couple years down the track or

944
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:13,950
something it hurts too much and I've

945
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,090
still got feelings for this other person

946
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,520
am I it doesn't feel like they're gonna

947
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:19,560
go away anytime soon you know you know

948
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:24,210
what if this movie does really well yeah

949
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:32,400
it might work maybe definitely at that

950
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:34,050
point do you still take that you never

951
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,150
know people change they're really

952
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:39,330

953
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:39,690
yeah just sad times guys I need a break

954
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:44,100
now

00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:45,600
it'll be better yeah how's your

956
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,050
brother's love life then you can [ __ ] on

957
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,550
that

958
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:50,250
yeah let's [ __ ] on that Donna I don't

959
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:51,600
know like I he's I think he's more of a

960
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:52,800
sleep round sort of guy right now as

961
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,120
well I guess he's not looking for

962
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,930
something I don't know though I don't

963
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,430
really talk to him about it

964
00:33:54,930 --> 00:34:00,660
mmm that's how much we don't talk about

965
00:33:56,430 --> 00:34:01,920
things but like yeah who knows I know

966
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:04,200
there's a girl that's interested in here

967
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,370
interested in him here but I don't know

968
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,870
maybe hmm

969
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:08,340
we'll see I just said that like our

970
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,909
productivity will go down if we're in a

971
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,730
relationship

972
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:14,520
yeah true you know yeah do you feel that

973
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:16,169
I feel like you definitely if you're not

974
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,580
in a relationship you don't have to you

975
00:34:16,169 --> 00:34:19,140
can focus on what you're interested in

976
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:21,450
yeah you have to worry about another

977
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:23,880
person so yeah I think you can still

978
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:25,919
make it work but it is time time is like

979
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,870
limited you know yeah yeah and you have

980
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:29,010
to use some that time so how long how

981
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:30,870
long have you been in your relationship

982
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:32,909
for about a little over three years

983
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:38,000
almost four years yeah yeah that's

984
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:38,000
awesome see ya love when love loves back

985
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:53,940
for me affirmed you Ryan

986
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:55,740
well that's oh I don't know if it was it

987
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:57,870
to the same degree yeah that you're

988
00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:00,570
describing yeah a lot a lot of the

989
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:06,490
previous girlfriends that I've had word

990
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:08,410
ended up premium of yeah that and it

991
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:11,230
yeah for the most part just didn't work

992
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:14,349
out yeah it wasn't like same scenario I

993
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:18,160
guess yeah how many had serious ones

994
00:35:14,349 --> 00:35:20,040
right like maybe like 4 4 3 3 3 yeah

995
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,450
so Yukon high school that's why oh

996
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:24,640
that's like high school is like a couple

997
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:27,280
years yeah well that still sounds like

998
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,560
it could be serious yeah yeah maybe but

999
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,460
yeah holy crap for relationships yeah

1000
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,910
yeah

1001
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:37,599
you've got your experience then uh I

1002
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:38,530
mean not really like this is the one I'm

1003
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,589
in currently the longest relationship

1004
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:43,240
I've been in yeah I'm still learning are

1005
00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:44,500
you gonna get married have children well

1006
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,359
I mean that's one of the things to it

1007
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,280
like I'm still trying to figure out I

1008
00:35:46,359 --> 00:35:50,140
mean I think obviously that's always

1009
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,950
been the goal yeah you know your kid

1010
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:54,460
like I said I had a plan and then that's

1011
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:57,220
completely changed

1012
00:35:54,460 --> 00:36:00,070
ya know so it's hard to say I mean yeah

1013
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:01,450
I mean with you like are you if you're

1014
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:03,700
gonna be working in this area are you

1015
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,930
gonna stay in LA uh so yeah I think it

1016
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,220
will be like a back-and-forth thing it

1017
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:07,960
it depends on where we're gonna shoot

1018
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,010
this film though mm-hmm like I'm if

1019
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,820
we're gonna shoot it here then I'll stay

1020
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:11,830
here if we're gonna shoot it in

1021
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:13,359
Australia then I head back to Australia

1022
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:14,680
right but even in being even after this

1023
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,570
movie though like you're probably gonna

1024
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:19,390
write more and have to come back out and

1025
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:20,710
pitch yeah yeah so like I think I want

1026
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:22,420
to be out here if I've got a purpose to

1027
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:23,950
be out here even for like it when I

1028
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:25,089
travel I'd rather travel if I've got

1029
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,980
something to travel for I hate just

1030
00:36:25,089 --> 00:36:28,780
travelling for the sake of traveling you

1031
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:30,130
know like if I'm doing a brand here I'll

1032
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,570
go there or for shooting this here I'll

1033
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:33,430
go there right so like if I've got a

1034
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:34,750
purpose to be in LA then like I'll come

1035
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:38,320
out here you think you get over a live

1036
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:40,330
out here I do really miss friends back

1037
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,339
home it is like it's really yeah but

1038
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:44,050
like yeah I think so I think I'd love to

1039
00:36:42,339 --> 00:36:45,670
have a house here in a house in LA and

1040
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:47,830
go back and forth cuz I'm back and forth

1041
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,910
anyway but like yeah like I always spend

1042
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,619
heaps of time here then I'm like I

1043
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:52,359
really miss home and then I go back home

1044
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:53,650
and I go I really miss LA so it's like

1045
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:54,760
yeah it's always I think it'll be I

1046
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:56,170
think I'll have a home in both places

1047
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:59,380
what do you what do you miss about it

1048
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:59,620
Adelaide ah having my heart broken

1049
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:03,870
really

1050
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:06,790
[Laughter]

1051
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:10,300
no I think it's like um yeah like the

1052
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:16,840
friends and family like uh you know this

1053
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:18,190
going it's crew yeah I think I think

1054
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,480
it's mostly missing friends and family

1055
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:21,640
and also it's a lot easier to shoot

1056
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:24,250
Natalie you know it's hard to shoot in

1057
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:26,880
LA like it oh yeah it's terrible yeah

1058
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:30,010
well you can't blow [ __ ] up here

1059
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,630
speaking of blowing stuff what like some

1060
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:33,760
of your videos it has extremely high

1061
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:35,620
production value yeah

1062
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:39,340
what's like the most you guys have ever

1063
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:40,390
spent on a single in a video I mean you

1064
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,770
don't have to answer but no I will

1065
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:45,250
answer it it's a it's a pretty stupid

1066
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:48,220
answer so like one time we dropped 130 K

1067
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:49,180
in a video and I got to monetize and

1068
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:51,610
stuff from one hundred and thirty

1069
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:55,560
thousand US dollars so that's Australian

1070
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:59,740
dollars poi like around 90 to 100 K

1071
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:02,080
money and then like it was Dragon Ball Z

1072
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:03,250
versus Avatar hmm I said like we did

1073
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,900
like we built these sets we're like

1074
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:06,700
flooding sets we built we're like it was

1075
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,500
just like like massive VFX shots and

1076
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:10,300
like it was like a lot you know even

1077
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,500
like I'm all sinking the set it was so

1078
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,020
expensive

1079
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:15,190
we I love the video but I just got the

1080
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,900
wallet I straightaway we made like

1081
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:19,150
harden him what we made off that but no

1082
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:20,440
idea what he's meant yeah it was the

1083
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:22,150
biggest waste of money oh there was a

1084
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,250
brat like a brandy oh and there's some

1085
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:26,650
more no no no bro yeah so you guys just

1086
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:29,860
we were like we want to make this we

1087
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:31,060
want to be this money yeah like we

1088
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,080
always like there's things that we want

1089
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,520
to take off and things that we want to

1090
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,380
do like I want to do a flooding set so

1091
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,090
he made the video based on the flooding

1092
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:39,160
set alright you know there's stuff like

1093
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:40,480
we're doing in this Harry Potter star

1094
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,520
wars video where it's like I want to do

1095
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,710
that you know that Harry Potter car that

1096
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,810
flies look I want to do that practically

1097
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:48,370
so like we've like that practical flying

1098
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:49,960
car yeah yeah I'm gonna show you there's

1099
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:51,430
not much really cool so like Michael was

1100
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,350
dangling off the door and it's like

1101
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,830
flying through the air yeah it's really

1102
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:55,660
cool

1103
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:57,670
luckily a brand did this video though

1104
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:59,350
okay yeah so like yeah that's correct

1105
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:00,940
how do you like learn all this cuz

1106
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:02,980
you're like you said you didn't really

1107
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:04,390
care for school or anything yeah you

1108
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:06,370
couldn't hold down a job but when you

1109
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:08,800
find this passion how do you learn that

1110
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:10,300
well I don't know like um I guess stunts

1111
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,740
she sort of learns to it your own way

1112
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:13,240
but then we've got a stunt coordinator

1113
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:14,830
as well which we can say I want to do

1114
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,280
this this and this and then he can

1115
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:17,960
properly plot it out and planned

1116
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,240
and he's really good at that so yeah

1117
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,590
shell out Judd Judd wild I say he's

1118
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,820
awesome and like for our film we're

1119
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:25,370
definitely gonna get him you know and

1120
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,810
then I don't know just like you practice

1121
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:28,850
over the years and you get better at it

1122
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:30,830
you get better at doing whatever you're

1123
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:32,660
rehearsing so each video that we do is

1124
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:33,980
like it's a practice ground you know

1125
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:36,350
just kind of just like combining old

1126
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:37,580
ideas together interesting yeah all the

1127
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:40,520
skills that you learn over those years

1128
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:41,750
and craft yeah so like yeah Ike I'm

1129
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,460
really excited for this video to come

1130
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:48,130
out cuz it's really big and like it's

1131
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:50,600
super exciting like so besides the whole

1132
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:58,160
unrequited love situation where else did

1133
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:59,240
you draw I would say I like but where do

1134
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,630
you where else did you get your like

1135
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:04,010
inspiration from you know yeah it's a

1136
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:08,600
weird thing I do this thing to my

1137
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:10,940
friends which is pretty cruel if I'm

1138
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,980
really fixated on like how would people

1139
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:16,490
react to a certain situation in real

1140
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:18,560
life you know so like I'd act out or

1141
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:23,300
pretend something's happening to certain

1142
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:25,520
people pissy example yeah yeah there was

1143
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,750
a big project that we worked on on the

1144
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,370
rock record I don't want to say it

1145
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:30,020
because I people still think that it's

1146
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:32,240
rule on our channel but like there was a

1147
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:33,530
project that we did that wasn't real and

1148
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,000
then like no one knew that it wasn't

1149
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:36,320
real everyone like we played it out like

1150
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,110
it was real and everyone's reactions

1151
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:40,430
were completely like what's going on and

1152
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:41,900
like you got you get to see people's

1153
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:43,730
real reactions because everyone has a

1154
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:45,590
face of how they acting real laughter

1155
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:47,300
then like you know when something

1156
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:49,010
actually happens you know everyone

1157
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,900
changes so I'm just I'm so interested in

1158
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:52,190
that sort of thing like with the script

1159
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,950
there seems that I wrote it was like I

1160
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:56,330
want to act this out with you know you

1161
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:58,430
know my friends and see how these people

1162
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:59,870
would actually react in situations do

1163
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:01,850
you have characters based off of your

1164
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:04,250
real-life friends and in a way yeah ish

1165
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:05,960
like I based characters unlike is I find

1166
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:07,580
it easier to write if I've got someone

1167
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,110
around for me I can fix this person in

1168
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,940
my head I can know how this person talk

1169
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:12,290
and I'll hang out with someone a lot to

1170
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,640
get their lingo and get how they would

1171
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:15,710
speak and like find out how they would

1172
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,840
react to certain things so I do I do

1173
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:18,830
like yeah I do I do definitely based

1174
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,780
certain characters off for certain

1175
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:22,160
people and like yeah and then like in

1176
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,780
this film as characters at a base to

1177
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,730
myself you know elements of that and

1178
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:27,620
then yet a lot from like friends and all

1179
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:30,140
that socially it's so like yeah like

1180
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:31,730
there's like um fight for example

1181
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:33,799
there's like a scene in our script where

1182
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:35,180
his kids offered like a cigarette from

1183
00:41:33,799 --> 00:41:38,390
his friend and he really looks up to the

1184
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:40,579
friends and he I come he like I wanted

1185
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:42,829
to see how like our neighbor would react

1186
00:41:40,579 --> 00:41:43,940
to that so I offered a cigarette I don't

1187
00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:45,829
smoke or anything I'm never gonna give

1188
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:47,779
it to him to see how you react to that

1189
00:41:45,829 --> 00:41:49,720
Gyan I mean yeah so like our today is

1190
00:41:47,779 --> 00:41:52,309
just looking at that sort of thing fun

1191
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:54,200
people's behaviour interesting that's

1192
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:56,390
really interesting cuz I remember Ryan

1193
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,730
saying something similar to me like he

1194
00:41:56,390 --> 00:42:00,019
likes seeing the reactions making

1195
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:02,210
somebody feel something when you make

1196
00:42:00,019 --> 00:42:08,630
your content oh yeah that was but he's

1197
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:10,549
doing it just to make his never to

1198
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:11,839
people that can't handle its people oh

1199
00:42:10,549 --> 00:42:12,950
my god what's happening they're having

1200
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:15,049
fun of it it's never I'm not like

1201
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:16,519
traumatizing anyway like it's people

1202
00:42:15,049 --> 00:42:19,039
that can take it like friends that know

1203
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:21,440
me and stuff and so like once they find

1204
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:23,210
out that this is like a prank or this is

1205
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,660
whatever like if people are covert it's

1206
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:25,970
fine

1207
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:28,460
so generally these people are cool with

1208
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:30,650
it but like at first was it kind of like

1209
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:32,900
oh do they feel like you're using them

1210
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:38,150
or no really it'd be a thing where i'm

1211
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:39,589
like outside will you mean the someone

1212
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:41,809
walking around outside and like JT like

1213
00:42:39,589 --> 00:42:53,210
that sort of stop and then we get out

1214
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:54,740
there's not really anyone walking that

1215
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:56,750
just were to happen right now and then

1216
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:58,099
we just to see how we would react to see

1217
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:59,119
how you do I was just doing a thing like

1218
00:42:58,099 --> 00:43:00,950
it's not a prank I'm just trying to

1219
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,720
study yeah I was just study it's like ah

1220
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:05,569
yeah and then people know they're like

1221
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:07,220
oh you know okay it's never I would

1222
00:43:05,569 --> 00:43:10,910
anyone go like oh man that's too far

1223
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:15,079
you're the boy who cried wolf actually

1224
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:18,619
someone else [ __ ] come out and paper

1225
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:21,319
right there I know it's doing funny but

1226
00:43:18,619 --> 00:43:24,859
like yeah it probably is a little bit

1227
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:26,539
mean now that I think of it but yeah our

1228
00:43:24,859 --> 00:43:27,410
friends are walking further down bright

1229
00:43:26,539 --> 00:43:32,089

00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:17,220
was like I'd won money on K sighs fight

1250
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:18,900
I was like I'm gonna put money on this

1251
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:20,190
one but I just couldn't bring myself to

1252
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:23,849
bet on either of them I don't want to

1253
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:25,049
root for ya cuca sauce JJ what I'm like

1254
00:44:23,849 --> 00:44:28,920
I don't want to see Logan getting his

1255
00:44:25,049 --> 00:44:30,930
ass kicked I don't see ya so it was like

1256
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,880
um yeah I can't pick a side like it's

1257
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:34,770
impossible like I hated watching that

1258
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,599
fight mm-hmm it was so painful to watch

1259
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:38,609
I was like yeah you're watching two

1260
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:41,010
friends beat the [ __ ] out of each other

1261
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:42,780
it's awful I hated it you know it's fine

1262
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:45,240
wait when we had chaos on the podcast we

1263
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:47,490
asked him like could you ever be friends

1264
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,779
with Logan and he said he could he

1265
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:50,640
thinks he could he thinks he could yeah

1266
00:44:48,779 --> 00:44:56,190
yeah and but then he said he would never

1267
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:57,839
be friends with Jake but I thought it

1268
00:44:56,190 --> 00:45:00,750
was so interesting because there Logan

1269
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:03,900
and ki are beefing right yeah what are

1270
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:05,869
they are they are he said he thinks he

1271
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,619
could be I might be misquoting but

1272
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:09,450
thinks he could be friends with him

1273
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:11,490
Anderson I said that's a Logan and

1274
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:13,529
Logan's like no not like I think Logan's

1275
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:15,210
like not with it now like I don't know

1276
00:45:13,529 --> 00:45:17,010
if I I feel like they could still be

1277
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:20,869
from so interesting you instigated that

1278
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:23,069
you means that it's more studying

1279
00:45:20,869 --> 00:45:24,960
running the world from behind the scenes

1280
00:45:23,069 --> 00:45:28,380
like I'm curious what did that what did

1281
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,059
you say to Logan to convince him I was

1282
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:31,470
just I saw I went there and I was like I

1283
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:33,960
just came back from this fight you know

1284
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:35,099
and like can't cycle drugs like I saw

1285
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,270
that what he does even up late like

1286
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:38,430
Logan was sort of like you know JJ

1287
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:39,990
doesn't really upload much but I just

1288
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:41,369
kept like I just kept talking about

1289
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:43,529
every day and bringing up every day and

1290
00:45:41,369 --> 00:45:45,089
I was just like it would be the biggest

1291
00:45:43,529 --> 00:45:47,339
event in internet history Logan like

1292
00:45:45,089 --> 00:45:48,930
it's huge right he's the biggest

1293
00:45:47,339 --> 00:45:50,760
youtuber of the UK you're the biggest

1294
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:52,680
youtuber over the US it's a Clash of the

1295
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:56,279
Titans brah like I don't know I was just

1296
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,940
yeah that's push for three months he's

1297
00:45:56,279 --> 00:45:58,619
like I got

1298
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:00,240
these are for three months spent all of

1299
00:45:58,619 --> 00:46:01,920
is that I think I was left like two

1300
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,420
weeks trying to convince him like I was

1301
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,400
like really trying to convince him like

1302
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:07,589
yeah and he eventually said yeah I'm

1303
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:09,329
gonna do it brah but you know I think he

1304
00:46:07,589 --> 00:46:10,980
was great I think the the fact that they

1305
00:46:09,329 --> 00:46:13,589
both fought it was super exciting for

1306
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:15,089
the community yeah it was a sport like

1307
00:46:13,589 --> 00:46:17,670
it was like not like an actual

1308
00:46:15,089 --> 00:46:19,500
aggressive leg like I remember we got

1309
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:21,210
like like we did an interview with BBC

1310
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,440
before the fire and they sounded like it

1311
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:24,089

00:46:31,349 --> 00:46:37,050
to villainize it yeah you can say that

1318
00:46:32,849 --> 00:46:39,810
about ESPN there yeah yeah it's a

1319
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:41,369

get knocked out and there's such big

1336
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,520
personalities and like you know they're

1337
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,560
all their family and friends are such as

1338
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:17,160
males in their communities and I don't

1339
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,770
know it just

1340
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:21,290
I'd feel gonna be painful to see for

1341
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:24,210
sure that's when's that happening

1342
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:28,109
November the 9th yeah so we have another

1343
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:28,640
question from a new burps sorry sorry

1344
00:47:28,109 --> 00:47:33,900
about that

1345
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:37,319
apologize Instagram in in Twitter from a

1346
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:39,359
man em7 can you have a fight with

1347
00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:41,460
Michael I think what they meant is would

1348
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:42,960
you maybe box all thanks Michael yeah

1349
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:44,220
everyone's like oh this dis track stuff

1350
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,849
is just for like a setup for the

1351
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,950
undercard fight

1352
00:47:44,849 --> 00:47:48,750
I'll be honest right now I'd get my

1353
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:51,359
[ __ ] head kick in if I fault Michael

1354
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:52,770
I've definitely is he stronger than you

1355
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:54,990
oh yeah waste talking to me like he's

1356
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:57,210
like he's easy ease the dominant win for

1357
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:59,250
sure I would get destroyed by Michael

1358
00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:00,780
like is because he works out and stuff

1359
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:02,310
and you don't or yeah I think so and

1360
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:04,530
he's just more physically active like I

1361
00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:07,890
sit and write and edit and Michael cut

1362
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:09,450
up and he's like yeah yes I like get

1363
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:10,730
destroyed it would be fun though to get

1364
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:13,489
my head keeping my mark

1365
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:16,200
[Laughter]

1366
00:48:13,489 --> 00:48:18,210
it'd be cool to see a boxing chess match

1367
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:21,150
like one round boxing one round chess

1368
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:29,789
yeah there you go see there we go

1369
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:32,249
terrible idea yeah alright we got

1370
00:48:29,789 --> 00:48:34,529
another question here from Oh daddy Jack

1371
00:48:32,249 --> 00:48:36,450
Oh daddy Jack this is a little more

1372
00:48:34,529 --> 00:48:38,549
serious question I think okay would you

1373
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:41,400
die for your brother what I'd die for my

1374
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:43,109
brother uh yeah probably if someone on a

1375
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,880
gun I don't know what's the situation

1376
00:48:43,109 --> 00:48:47,670
spell out a scenario for me there's a

1377
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:50,700
gun and pointed at your brother's head

1378
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:57,809
either you go or you go I'd say like

1379
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:59,069
honest I'd say take him yeah

1380
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:00,210
well this would be a research thing he

1381
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:02,640
doesn't have to set up and see what the

1382
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:07,829
real reaction yeah yes we're gonna prank

1383
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:09,630
him now and actually kill him now yeah I

1384
00:49:07,829 --> 00:49:10,739
would die for him to be honest if like

1385
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:13,680
if some of the guns were said I'd

1386
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:15,359
probably really traumatically jump in

1387
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:21,539
front of the bullet and take it for him

1388
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:23,190
what do you do the same maybe see this

1389
00:49:21,539 --> 00:49:24,630
is the thing see everyone's got their

1390
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:26,640
answers of what they'd say but how would

1391
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:28,079
someone truly react what's true you have

1392
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:32,549
to set up the scenario and find out

1393
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:34,380
right now that we talked about it I mean

1394
00:49:32,549 --> 00:49:53,160
