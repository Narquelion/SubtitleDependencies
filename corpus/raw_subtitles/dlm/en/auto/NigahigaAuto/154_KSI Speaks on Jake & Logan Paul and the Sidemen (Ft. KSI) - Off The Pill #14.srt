have you been working on your album just

48
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:12,200
came out right so yeah all we came out

49
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:16,220
two weeks ago

50
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:18,800
and managed to get a 17 and the Official

51
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:21,200
Charts and number one on R&B charts

52
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,720
which is insane for us we've been

53
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,450
working on this album for so so long and

54
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,120
to finally put it out and for people to

55
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:31,190
absolutely love it it's just

56
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,930
unbelievable so yeah we're just yes

57
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:35,060
that's awesome all right now so I think

58
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,319
for listeners who don't really know who

59
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,180
you are it's not you and a side minutes

60
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,940
use Randolph right yeah Mia right now so

61
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:44,180
we did the joint album and we released

62
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:47,510
ten songs and you have people are just

63
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,950
going nuts over us I think the most

64
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,900
interesting thing about it that really

65
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,269
grabbed the headlines as well is you

66
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:56,209
guys I think talked about how you're not

67
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:56,989
if people use your songs in their videos

68
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,730
and stuff you're not gonna like

69
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:01,250
copyright strike that Yeah right

70
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:04,549
nothing literary will like why I mean I

71
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:07,670
grew up being able to use cover music

72
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:10,810
before the YouTube started like clamping

73
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:13,370
down on everything but I was just like I

74
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,680
wanted to essentially go back to that

75
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:19,340
and for me like it's not all about the

76
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,380
money I just want to just do use it cuz

77
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:25,400
I just enjoy it's just the hobby for me

78
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:27,410
so to be able to allow people to use

79
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,290
that means use my music in their videos

80
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:32,660
I think it's just I guess well it's the

81
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:35,510
whole new age yeah I'm trying to never

82
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,320
work with a label yeah that's why I'm

83
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,359
independent

84
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,790
yeah I'd literally the best thing yeah

85
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:42,260
to be able to be independent and let me

86
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:46,220
we'll just use your music and you know

87
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:49,190
just literally go against the system

88
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:52,359
essentially and yeah I think it's I

89
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,359
think it's a nice move

90
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,600
I mean you were signed I guess we can go

91
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,299
a little bit deeper on this because

92
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,980
you're one of the few YouTube musicians

93
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:04,040
who are actually signed to a label right

94
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:06,769
so maybe you can I was signed to Ireland

95
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,329
yeah and then it kind of just went a bit

96
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:10,579
self I don't know if you're allowed to

97
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:11,959
talk to it maybe NDA's or whatever but

98
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:15,769
what was your experience I guess pros

99
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:21,979
and cons with it you know I I guess pro

100
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:24,930
was you can be honest dude you don't

101
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:27,389
have to say think of any pros

102
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,830
I guess they allowed me to collab with

103
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:31,070
people I wouldn't be able to collab with

104
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:35,010
so Waka Flocka

105
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:36,750
I was able to do a song with him and not

106
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:39,210
like I wouldn't have been able to do

107
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,370
that yeah so they were able to get that

108
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:45,630
connection but uh

109
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:49,520
besides died that they didn't really

110
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:52,740
push me like as much as they could have

111
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,290
so I don't know I mean they guess I

112
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,590
guess they helped a bit but I'd say con

113
00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:01,050
wise they they didn't really focus on

114
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:03,419
the music that much this way they focus

115
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:05,970
on everything but the music they just

116
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:07,650
saw my marketing they just yeah exactly

117
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,630
I saw my audience and were like okay

118
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:12,060
let's try and make an app for him and

119
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:14,970
let's try and monetize the app so that

120
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:18,690
we can get money through that let's try

121
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:20,490
and get a clothing line for him and

122
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:22,050
let's try and make money through that or

123
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:24,389
let's try and do this or this thing I

124
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:27,090
was like wait let's focus on the music

125
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:30,030
first like I have music let's you know

126
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:32,910
push that and they then they never

127
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:36,780
really got behind it so eventually I did

128
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:38,460
my did my term on the contract and then

129
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:41,370
peace down right so they were just

130
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,500
basically milking you yeah their

131
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,780
followers me so was this during the

132
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,550
whole like like when you were like a

133
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,650
like having the fight and stuff like no

134
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:54,510
no this is way before okay so this was a

135
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:59,460
like around - yeah - out 17 haha 2017

136
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:59,880
but you know 2017 maybe in a bit of 2016

137
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,490
yeah

138
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:05,789
so essentially like when I had my break

139
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:08,160
like my long six seven month

140
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:12,240
I was still signed to Ireland so they

141
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,310
were still expecting like an EP so I had

142
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:19,260
one more EPA of just like five songs to

143
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:21,120
give to them so I put out space what

144
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,039
because for me I want I thought space

145
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,760
cuz I was just like it's important for

146
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:29,070
me and then I put down and I thought

147
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:33,060
okay island do you want to take this not

148
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:34,230
know otherwise like now we're not gonna

149
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,880
take that one

150
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:38,160
and then the whole dish strikes

151
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,750
happening right right and then I made an

152
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,640
EP of that I know like yeah we'll take

153
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,750
this uh-huh because I saw the bars and

154
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,630
they're like oh yeah we can capitalize

155
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:49,710
on this yeah I think so I it's actually

156
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:54,050
crazy I can't like put little boy in my

157
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:56,970
video else I'll get claimed on it oh

158
00:06:54,050 --> 00:07:02,640
sorry I sold all my discharge I can't

159
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:05,610
like use what they actually own the song

160
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:10,470
yeah yeah yes it's a bit annoying Wow

161
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:13,980
yeah labels well you you mentioned diss

162
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:17,280
tracks and I this was something that you

163
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:20,280
know it is older drama but it's kind of

164
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,140
a it's what really brought a lot of eyes

165
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,060
you know to you and your music and stuff

166
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,860
so you had diss tracks with like sideman

167
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,510
and stuff yes and that was huge you know

168
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,100
there's a lot of heat between it and you

169
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:31,920
you made a video where it talks about it

170
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:34,530
was all real right yes and uh I guess

171
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:36,870
how do you cuz there's a lot of Internet

172
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:40,950
drama that goes on between people so how

173
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:42,300
do you solve that off-camera you know

174
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:44,220
because these are your friends and stuff

175
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:49,140
and you guys did end up settling it I

176
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:51,060
think it's it's time time like like with

177
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:54,180
me and Harry it was a bit cagey like

178
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:58,320
especially after his second decide on me

179
00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:00,780
like I was pissed yeah now one is just

180
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,330
legitimately yeah so like you guys are

181
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:05,520
just exaggerating we are friends right

182
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:07,380
but like the stuff we say is real like

183
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,370
everything we're saying it's like truth

184
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:13,560
so it still like sucks right I got you

185
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:16,590
well I said like it took some time to

186
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,450
like go over that boy that's nice issue

187
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:22,710
it's just time who extended the olive

188
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:25,440
branch like who was the first one to be

189
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:27,600
like oh that's not a saint yeah like a

190
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,640
peace thing got it got it I think it's

191
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,440
just it's just a thing that just

192
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,780
happened because obviously we do videos

193
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,820
together so we have to eventually like

194
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:38,610
sort out we couldn't have can just be

195
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:42,330
enemies forever yeah you and Logan never

196
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:45,330
become friends who would you be more

197
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:47,340
friends with Logan or Jake that's like

198
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,840
cocaine before Jake

199
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:51,720
come on that's it wait so you're are you

200
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:55,380
are you fighting Jake no I'm fine Logan

201
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:58,110
okay because I saw something I didn't I

202
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:00,390
was just trolling oh okay yeah so I was

203
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:05,430
just trying to be like on the YJ because

204
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:07,890
Logan's falling off of this right I was

205
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:09,990
always in the fallopian like yeah we've

206
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,370
literally been training to fight Logan

207
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:17,010
right why would you just switch it to

208
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:18,210
fight Jake but yeah I know well I mean I

209
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:20,040
I mean you already talked about like

210
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:21,780
your beef that you had with the Simon

211
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,860
and stuff but I always wondered I mean

212
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:26,670
we talked about it last time you were

213
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:29,310
here but um just I mean I to a certain

214
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:31,530
degree how real is that like how much do

215
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:35,070
you not like each other I just I see

216
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:38,220
somewhat me enlighten yeah I think it's

217
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:39,870
more like an ego thing like Oh see he

218
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:43,760
did the whole forest thing but it's like

219
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:48,290
precise I don't really have any real

220
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:51,390
like anger towards him I think it's more

221
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:53,550
just to show that I'm better than him

222
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:56,430
right right yeah like even though he's

223
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:58,560
had all of this all of the athletic

224
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:05,460
background and you know he thinks he's

225
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:07,260
mr. tough man I'm there like even after

226
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:11,130
your slice well no yeah go first yeah

227
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:15,570
you're fine so we have this so we could

228
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:17,580
just be ourselves like even your fight

229
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:19,170
that's why afterwards like he said he

230
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,030
talked about how he messed up and then

231
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:23,130
the fight kind of like you know gave him

232
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:25,260
an opportunity to reinvent himself and

233
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,880
he gave a lot of credit to you and then

234
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,410
when his dog died like you were like a

235
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,760
man like sorry to hear about it so it's

236
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,050
not like you guys have like it's not

237
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,160
like you're like ha good for you you're

238
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:38,220
not the worst for you some people are

239
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:40,050
like that like I am human as well Yeah

240
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:43,500
right who's your dog it's like losing a

241
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:45,480
baby yeah it hurt so I'm not gonna just

242
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,240
be like how you did your dog died low

243
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,910
yeah I exact it's just stupid it's just

244
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,590
it's inhumane so you know I was just

245
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:58,070
like and so you got a soft side then

246
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:58,070
it's just being

247
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:04,410
empathy isn't it like yeah yeah just

248
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:08,730
certain things like you've gotta be like

249
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:09,930
okay oh sorry so like and I don't mean

250
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,610
to bring it back to the music but this

251
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:14,790
is something I was like interested in

252
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:16,170
stuff because I wanted to continue like

253
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:19,680
you had the beef with the Seidman and

254
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:21,570
everything and then you had a beef with

255
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,240
Logan and you had his dish track towards

256
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:27,450
him for the fight and then you had a

257
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,770
diss track with quad deca hmm and you

258
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:31,500
guys were popping off on each other

259
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:33,870
alive yeah and then when New Age got

260
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,240
released he was actually on a track with

261
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:38,790
you which a lot before he wasn't on the

262
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,500
Trouble Man he's gonna travel Randolph

263
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:56,010
Oh see I'm not on it

264
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:58,610
oh you just didn't want to do it but so

265
00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:01,590
the beef there's it's pretty real I mean

266
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:04,470
it's still kind of heated it's not it's

267
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:08,490
like I think we both respect each other

268
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:10,620
but it's more like we think we think

269
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:12,870
also like we think we're better than the

270
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:16,470
other so it's essentially like you and

271
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:18,030
Logan but now in rapping table yeah kind

272
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,590
of seems like writers like the way

273
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:21,240
fighters interact with each other yeah

274
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:22,650
they have respect for each other and

275
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,780
what they do they weren't fighting each

276
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:26,100
other it would be you know respect to

277
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:29,270
you but I'm so better than you that's

278
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,950
that's what it's like it's really okay

279
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:34,380
right it's not at that Conor McGregor

280
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:36,210
level of like I'm gonna throw up

281
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,770
he would laugh at the dog dying yeah

282
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:40,380
like I feel like you put a tweet out you

283
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:51,110
like a little too far but I mean it draw

284
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:53,730
it if you pulling back the punches now

285
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:55,560
just what what about Jake I mean I

286
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,540
haven't completely followed every detail

287
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,160
and I only see headlines you know like I

288
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,020
don't know that for details like what

289
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:05,160
about Jay is so much worse he's just

290
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:07,380
he's actually a [ __ ] like yeah I know

291
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,130
like he's actually about person like

292
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,920
Logan

293
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:14,890
right Logan I mean Jake is an actual

294
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,140
like prick he's an actual bad person

295
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:19,810
like his whole demeanor everything about

296
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,380
him just stinks man and I just don't

297
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,300
like it

298
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:25,690
and is it toward a direct interaction

299
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:28,600
that you had with him like between me

300
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:30,580
and him between just my people around us

301
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,709
like no none of my friends liked him

302
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:34,899
like some of my friends are still like

303
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:36,850
Logan right even though I'd find him

304
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:40,000
they still like like yeah it is like

305
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,720
this somehow no one likes Jake Jake I've

306
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,760
never met him

307
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,630
so I can't and I never I don't wanna say

308
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,260
anything cuz I never met him I've never

309
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,060
met him either

310
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:48,070
when I met Logan honestly it was and I

311
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,839
said this before it was only once and it

312
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:51,490
was short but he was seem like a normal

313
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,230
dude like he didn't wasn't like acting

314
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:55,720
the way he does in videos and stuff

315
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:59,140
um-hmm but I don't know I I don't know

316
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:02,230
I'm well enough but that's interesting

317
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:03,640
you have real beef with Jake that's in a

318
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:07,209
more logical foot I mean are you guys

319
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:13,750
alright so pretty much the plan is once

320
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:18,399
I get through Logan through drink was

321
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:20,399
Logan tricks that it wasn't Logan and

322
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:26,920
Drake like talking or something though

323
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:31,089

Drake definitely yeah and you got our

326
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,500
rap in one round you guys are fighting

327
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:53,170
that's a good title for the fight there

328
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:57,339
are some punches she pitch it to him oh

329
00:14:53,170 --> 00:15:00,940

let's I mean you know it's like oh it's

360
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:33,140
like two fighters like let's melt this

361
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:35,390
yeah I kind of struggle to do like fake

362
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:37,940
things the answers yes then I call it

363
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:39,440
just doesn't feel authentic right right

364
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:42,200
I don't know I can't really lie put my

365
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,380
all into it where ever it's real and I

366
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:48,590
can just go to freaking moon and just go

367
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:50,500
ahead and so but I guess I guess what I

368
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:52,850
was leading to you because you are a

369
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,800
personality you know a lot of youtubers

370
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:57,740
are like oh I'm a tech youtuber or I'm a

371
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,090
DIY you know and and they try to you

372
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,710
know eventually their personal and

373
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:03,140
personality comes out but you've always

374
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:06,560
been just like this is me that's just

375
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:09,920
yeah raw genuine like because when I

376
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:12,530
started just going back all the way back

377
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,630
I start with FIFA I was just like oh my

378
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:16,730
gosh like I I don't want to do it fee

379
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:18,380
for the whole of my life like I'm

380
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:21,709
eventually gonna get bored and then what

381
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:25,640
so I always made that an important thing

382
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:29,880
to words and the point thing for me

383
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:32,370
you're a good rapper and for me

384
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,289
was to make sure that I showed my

385
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:36,630
personality through all my content so

386
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:42,990
I'd always not just do the same thing I

387
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:45,450
do other things like music acting skits

388
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:47,640
and with just all other games always

389
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:50,490
just trying to show people like oh this

390
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:53,340
is me like you know get used to me so

391
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:55,470
that me so that in the future whenever I

392
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,179
wanted to do anything I'd be able to

393
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:59,240
just do it and be like oh [ __ ] yeah

394
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:02,340
what's he doing next okay that's cool I

395
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:04,110
got to do this so speaking about future

396
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,820
I mean like what I mean like you said

397
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:08,940
you're into so many different things but

398
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:10,169
uh what is uh I mean what's next I mean

399
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,299
not next actually there's a lot of

400
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:14,640
things coming up but like what's like

401
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:20,159
future what's end goal um is it ideally

402
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:22,350
music it seems like um well there's

403
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:24,990
quite a few things like I like to say

404
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,950
I'm like jack of all trades but master

405
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,980
of none

406
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:34,559
oh damn that's the first time you've

407
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:37,980
ever dissed yourselves exclusive in

408
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:41,669
person yeah there's quite a few things I

409
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:44,880
want to do so at the moment I'm doing

410
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:48,960
like little skits on my main channel

411
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:52,770
just I guess get my audience prepared

412
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,780
for what like ready from to see me

413
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:56,159
acting that make sense just to see like

414
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,289
for them to get comfortable with me

415
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:00,000
acting and you know eventually I want

416
00:18:58,289 --> 00:19:01,140
you know to improve the content make it

417
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,380
better and better and better so

418
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:07,289
eventually in the future this could be

419
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:09,510
like a year two three years I can create

420
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:14,190
my own movie right so that's one of my

421
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:17,460
angles to do that but I know like it to

422
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:20,789
make a movie you know takes so much like

423
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:24,419
four and there's so many things you have

424
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:26,520
to deal with I'm nowhere near that point

425
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:29,419
so I'm like let me start with just

426
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:32,270
little like 10 15 minutes skits and

427
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:35,130
eventually create a movie through that

428
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:38,850
music I want to obviously do my own

429
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:41,580
album but I know with the album join

430
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:43,200
amor me and ran off like that's cool

431
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,240
but it's like okay

432
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,789
I want to take my oven to the next level

433
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,789
but for me to get to that part I still

434
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:52,889
need to I guess prove myself I feel like

435
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:54,870
well I mean like I feel like I proven

436
00:19:52,889 --> 00:19:58,080
myself I mean like prove myself

437
00:19:54,870 --> 00:20:00,720
musically like show that I am like on

438
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,220
another level right if I miss I mean

439
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,019
your albums did I mean it did well

440
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,600
though yeah isn't that it proof to

441
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:09,559
yourself - oh yeah I mean it's it's I

442
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:13,740
know I already know I'm sick

443
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:18,510
there we go confidence back where you

444
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:20,970
went why it's like I I need a literary

445
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:22,559
show people and it's just like sharing

446
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:25,649
people with different ways and

447
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:28,740
eventually once my album comes out

448
00:20:25,649 --> 00:20:32,549
people be like oh my god like holy crap

449
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:36,240
he is a monster so that's that's my plan

450
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:39,510
with that with the boxing fight Logan

451
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,669
fight Jake and then do a pro fight and

452
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:44,720
then just go from there trying to a pro

453
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:48,450
fight yeah yeah I think I'll be sick so

454
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:51,450
just train up for that and obviously

455
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:57,480
side men as well do side men videos a

456
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:59,880
lot of things yeah so much time and

457
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,409
energy in the day I mean that is I mean

458
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,200
you've been doing it though that's it

459
00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:07,019
like yeah like pretty much most of my

460
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,820
life it's just been this so yeah it's

461
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:12,720
just like you just keep going and just

462
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:15,029
see see what happens so yeah I just I

463
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,789
know for me it's a it's exciting but

464
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:18,480
it's not easy it's it's if anything it's

465
00:21:17,789 --> 00:21:23,659
stressful

466
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:25,019
I've had several breakdowns off-camera

467
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:26,519
you saying

468
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:28,620
well what do you mean breakdowns in

469
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:29,159
terms of what oh just wanting to quit

470
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,769
things

471
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:34,019
oh no no just like mentally like oh my

472
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:35,850
god like I can't do this I'm doing too

473
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:38,820

475
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:45,510
like so helpful throughout through my

476
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:48,360
years essentially helping me out so yeah

477
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:51,600
it she she she's just calm me down

478
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:54,419
several times and I just put up put up

479
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,840
with me as well because I I'm a bit of a

480
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:56,840
handful

481
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:02,100
but now she's been seized she's been

482
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:04,050
amazing and she's always amazing so yeah

483
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,120
she's helped me loads of that I guess uh

484
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:08,750
to follow up on that when you say yeah

485
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,640
like mental breakdowns cuz you almost

486
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:16,410
seem like somebody who like would never

487
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:19,320
have that you know oh yeah hundred

488
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:21,900
percent like so for you to say there's

489
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,420
like scum something completely that you

490
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:26,250
would have never fathom oh yeah I think

491
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:27,360
I mean I don't know how often I haven't

492
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,500
seen everything you've been in so I

493
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,500
don't know is that something you talked

494
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:35,220
about or oh no no no I never talked

495
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:39,600
about yeah and that's why why I don't

496
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:41,220
know I I'm just like I guess maybe it's

497
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,890
maybe people might want to hear about

498
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,840
I'm just for me I'm sure like I'd like I

499
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:47,910
don't need to put this on them yeah yeah

500
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,060
alright let me just do what I'm doing

501
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:54,270
and show that I'm you know it's still

502
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:55,980
alright you still doing well yeah and if

503
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:58,110
I do freak out or if I have a mental

504
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,490
breakdown I just do it off camera you

505
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,710
know behind closed doors

506
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:03,660
no one's affected nothing happens I yeah

507
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:05,430
I don't get there oh you know I'm there

508
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:08,280

509
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:11,070
these stuff I'm just there like this is

510
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,690
yeah this is what I'm doing etc and just

511
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:16,350
leave it at that yeah I respect that

512
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:18,210
yeah yeah I just it's kind of like why

513
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:20,220
would I put my burden on someone else

514
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:22,590
and I sense a lot of people especially

515
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:26,730
on YouTube use that for themselves yeah

516
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:27,000
yeah yeah I guess it's not really my

517
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,350
thing

518
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,240
yeah I mean I don't think there's any

519
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:31,530
right or wrong yeah it's just

520
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:40,320
interesting for us to hear yeah

521
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:42,390
especially like you said you're ultra

522
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,340
saw you know he came with gifts today a

523
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:48,750
bunch of waters I know I'm such a good

524
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:56,880
guy man between each round he's like is

525
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:58,919
everybody hydrated I'm just telling

526
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,129
people down human no yeah

527
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:04,950
like I'm not like Superman I'm right I

528
00:24:02,129 --> 00:24:07,830
mean I I I've seen a decent amount of

529
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:10,019
your videos hmm and I think this right

530
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:12,989
now is probably the most human that

531
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:15,149
you've ever looked on camera okay so in

532
00:24:12,989 --> 00:24:16,710
a long time you know so to see this is

533
00:24:15,149 --> 00:24:17,850
very different and it's very interesting

534
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:21,149
it's very unique that they get to see

535
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:23,659
this side of you and it's almost like

536
00:24:21,149 --> 00:24:26,279
you know wow he's not like just this

537
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:30,539
egotistical God who's like just laughing

538
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:32,460
at everything like like it's crazy

539
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:34,889
because like literally every podcast I

540
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,600
go on they all say the same thing they

541
00:24:34,889 --> 00:24:38,220
always like when I went on chat mates

542
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,309
and he was like oh I thought you'd give

543
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:42,629
me a [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah he was just like

544
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:43,379
I thought I was expecting to be an

545
00:24:42,629 --> 00:24:44,999
absolute [ __ ]

546
00:24:43,379 --> 00:24:46,830
yeah but you're just down to a normal

547
00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:52,259
guy I was like yeah I want to go that

548
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:53,960
far I wanna go but I it's just like I

549
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:56,999
don't know I

550
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:59,309
yeah I don't know I just whenever the

551
00:24:56,999 --> 00:25:01,950
cameras on I'm just like whatever it's

552
00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:07,619
like it is what it is they're trying to

553
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:09,869
be entertaining yeah yeah I don't like

554
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:14,279
that right yeah I know for me there

555
00:25:09,869 --> 00:25:18,090
isn't really a wall logic to what I do I

556
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:18,359
kind of just do and it just works I

557
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:20,489
guess

558
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:23,190
gotten you this far that's what people

559
00:25:20,489 --> 00:25:24,929
like you're just doing whatever comes to

560
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:30,929
your mind that's it like it's great it's

561
00:25:24,929 --> 00:25:35,609
crazy like people just so like screw it

562
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:38,340
so my bro says he does everything for

563
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:41,879
the fans like he's like he lets the fans

564
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:44,609
I guide him right where to go and for me

565
00:25:41,879 --> 00:25:47,549
I'm like that's a terabyte you two have

566
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:50,580
like yeah you know my fans are cool and

567
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:54,989
all that but I did youtube for me

568
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:57,119
essentially I did YouTube to just well

569
00:25:54,989 --> 00:25:59,190
just because I thought I wanted to make

570
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:00,840
entertaining videos and the people like

571
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:04,350
it cool people don't like it all right

572
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:07,039
yeah like it's just it's it's my life

573
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:10,139
essentially like I always feel like I I

574
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:12,150
don't want to be led by people if I make

575
00:26:10,139 --> 00:26:15,210
sense I always want to just lead

576
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:18,330
by my Siddeley leave myself into what

577
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:20,520
direction I want to go in and I I feel

578
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:22,110
like it's it's what what yeah I mean I

579
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,960
think that's like to me that's what I

580
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:26,940
think is the secret to longevity yeah on

581
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,920
YouTube or any any platform because then

582
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,960
you're doing it for yourself exactly I

583
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,700
can relate to your brother in that I

584
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,620
used to the reason I'm doing this

585
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,940
podcast is because I had to figure out I

586
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:38,580
had my own version of a mental breakdown

587
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:40,740
yeah I was like man I keep making these

588
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,390
same skits and I'm like I know people

589
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:44,430
like them and people think they're smart

590
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:45,780
but I'm so sick of it like it's not that

591
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:48,120
I don't want to make skits anymore just

592
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:49,590
I got so tired of doing the same thing I

593
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,050
just wanted to do something more real

594
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:56,430
yeah so I mean that's why I want to do

595
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:57,780
this and it's super-new only dude and I

596
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:59,190
knew I was gonna suffer in terms of like

597
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:01,020
viewership and stuff but like it's the

598
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:02,190
only way I could have continued it's not

599
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,320
like losing my mind

600
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:06,540
ya know so I think that's why you're

601
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,970
able I mean you've been around like free

602
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:15,180
when did you start YouTube I think was

603
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:18,720
on 2010 2010 a long time started yeah

604
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:20,610
right like I mean I'm not gonna count it

605
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,970
like yeah I asked seven videos of

606
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:28,020
churches was in school just played FIFA

607
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:30,000
seven I just posted that I'd say I did

608
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:31,950
it properly around like 2010 he took it

609
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:37,050
serious that's what I wanted to really

610
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:39,240
go home on this so yeah look how far

611
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:43,260
you've come in and now you're fighting

612
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:45,120
Logan the thing is like that was huge

613
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:47,820
though oh my - nice to meet you just

614
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:51,350
coming yeah like I just come and I just

615
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:53,910
grasp it yes that's pretty much how

616
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:57,420
essentially I'm at this point like

617
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:59,840
whenever I see ya an opportunity I'm

618
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:02,010
they're like yeah I'm going you know

619
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:05,190
smashing through that and just gonna

620
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:07,650
obliterate it and it's annoying I didn't

621
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:09,120
be Logan because I was like oh this is

622
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:11,970
gonna work then I can do this bah bah

623
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,310
bah but I mean we just got tattoos wrong

624
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:15,720
so make sure also you injured your hand

625
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:18,960
right or something all right

626
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:21,480
yeah why lose like it wasn't too bad

627
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,880
like it's just like just the left a bit

628
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,580
I was kind of shocked how much bigger he

629
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,510
looked

630
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:31,870
yeah you know he's huge dude he's a big

631
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:34,090
guy yeah like both he's so he's like I

632
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:38,679
fled it background yeah yeah it fully

633
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:40,360
shows so yeah that's why we we do we

634
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:42,580
didn't even expect the stance we didn't

635
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,470
expect anything before he was just gonna

636
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:46,600
be conventional and he just switched on

637
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:49,269
us so we're like alright cool right so

638
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,669
we need to make sure we cover all bases

639
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:55,240
now and that's what we're doing

640
00:28:51,669 --> 00:28:58,870
are you still training with we're down

641
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:04,480
no I'm trying I'm training with another

642
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:07,630
trainer Leone okay out here

643
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,090
I know so he he sometimes trains in

644
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:12,010
Vegas yeah but uh right now he's

645
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:16,919
training in the UK and he's got a fine

646
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:21,669
tube I think I believe next week yeah so

647
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:24,880
we bring a lot of boxers up in here but

648
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:26,200
I I think I just want to follow up with

649
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,919
one thing before we take this GG break

650
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,139
yeah

651
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:31,539
and just talking about the longevity of

652
00:29:29,139 --> 00:29:33,370
your career because uh in the beginning

653
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:35,799
like you're really popping off you know

654
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:36,820
a lot of your videos did really well

655
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:41,769
Harlem shake

656
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:43,870
definitely and then you took this long

657
00:29:41,769 --> 00:29:45,220
break mmm you know to kind of focus on

658
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:48,610
your music and stuff mm-hmm

659
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:51,159
do you feel like that kind of helped

660
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:53,590
regain your sanity or whatever you need

661
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:57,760
it yeah and 100 100 100 percent

662
00:29:53,590 --> 00:30:01,510
literally thought 2017 break like

663
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:03,880
essentially saved my whole career like

664
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:06,760
with everything because I was just

665
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:08,950
knowing a good spot I was I was just

666
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:11,620
doing old types of things yo I went to

667
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:14,799
where like oh I wasn't Romania to see a

668
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:18,639
girl like that's just crazy for me like

669
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:20,289
and I only met her like once and this

670
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:23,139
isn't UK and then I flew all the way to

671
00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:27,159
Romania in like not even like the

672
00:30:23,139 --> 00:30:30,309
capital some like random area brush off

673
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:31,990
and literally just to see and just day

674
00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:33,760
her and I was like

675
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:35,890
after outside what's wrong with me like

676
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:39,210
I'm literally just no I thought I just

677
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:42,250
didn't feel like right with myself and

678
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:47,940
eventually I just you know time to just

679
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:52,510
travel find myself oh my god find myself

680
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:55,030
but it's something you have to do and

681
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:56,980
eventually like you know I home did

682
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:59,350
Mycroft I figured out what do I want to

683
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,450
do with my life and I was like okay I've

684
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:03,370
got it all figured out and then just

685
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:05,770
things happened and it just wiped

686
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:08,800
perfectly and and what is I guess what

687
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:10,630
is one thing that like your Eureka

688
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,730
moment that hits you you know was there

689
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:14,770
a specific moment where like I know what

690
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:18,400
I need to do or this is where I regained

691
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:21,700
my sanity I think time just the break

692
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:24,850
and time was the best thing for me me

693
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:27,780
just separating myself from social media

694
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:31,570
and everything and just you know just

695
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:34,720
being with myself I think was the best

696
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:38,530
thing and if it took six months for me

697
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:40,480
to be like okay I'm good now but I feel

698
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:42,940
like it was necessary like it's just one

699
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,610
of those things like if you're so social

700
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:48,550
media this this data and it's just it's

701
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:51,310
just too much and I was just not happy

702
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:53,680
with like my content I wasn't happy with

703
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:56,170
where my music was I wasn't happy with

704
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:59,500
just everything I was just I just hate

705
00:31:56,170 --> 00:32:02,890
like what I was at the time and now I'm

706
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:05,230
just so happy and I feel right now I

707
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:07,960
understand it more and now I know when

708
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:10,180
to take a break now I know okay

709
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:12,730
I've been going ham I need to just relax

710
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:15,520
here for a bit and you know I do have

711
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:16,990
those times where I just don't go on

712
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,270
social media and I just you know just

713
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:23,850
relax and I feel like that's just

714
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:26,800
important I feel like yeah time and just

715
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:30,130
separate yourself from this whole social

716
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:33,820
media buzz is important yeah that's a

717
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:35,410
brave thing I mean being a especially if

718
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:37,750
you're doing well you know online and

719
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:39,700
suddenly in anything for like even

720
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:41,920
instagramers everybody when you're on

721
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:44,200
that wave it's really hard to justify

722
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,040
I'm sure you can relate I'm gonna take a

723
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,540
break especially

724
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:49,420
know how long you renting that yeah

725
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:52,240
exactly it's it's a scary decision to be

726
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:53,620
like I am going to I mean you never know

727
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,900
if you fall off you're never coming back

728
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:58,270
so that's that's it but I feel like even

729
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:00,970
if I did fall off I would have just

730
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:02,920
still don't usually not just being a

731
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:05,200
happier place but for me it's not like

732
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:07,180
oh I need get this mile views and you

733
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,700
get this this that that right for me

734
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:13,270
it's like okay I want to make this type

735
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:15,010
of content and make it this good and I

736
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:17,620
want to put this out and you know I

737
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:19,570
won't make a track like this or I want

738
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:23,800
to you know put something out like this

739
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:26,560
like it's just for me like I just like

740
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:28,510
my music videos I just spend like this

741
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:32,140
stupid amounts I think when Allah I

742
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:33,730
spent like 90,000 pounds on yeah and I

743
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:36,310
think the videos on like 2.8 million

744
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:38,230
views and like people look at that like

745
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:41,170
well that was a flop but for me I was

746
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:43,270
like now I'd like that's exactly why I

747
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:46,320
wanted to put a video out like that

748
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:48,820
right and I wanted to spend that much on

749
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:51,970
something like that because for me it

750
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:54,310
was sick it was and that's what I mean

751
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:56,650
like for me I just want to make sick

752
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:58,270
stuff and do sick stuff right for me

753
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:00,940
it's it's never been about the money

754
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:04,270
it's always just about me enjoying what

755
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:06,700
I'm doing and I feel like a lot of

756
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:08,500
people just get caught up with the views

757
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,000
and the stats and all this and that yeah

758
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,770
it's good to always just separate

759
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,210
yourself from that and just be like okay

760
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:17,080
today I want to just make this type of

761
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:19,410
content made this type of song etc and

762
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:22,090
just you know enjoy it that's it like

763
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:24,070
that's YouTube is all about for me

764
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:26,020
having fun and if you're having fun and

765
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:27,850
what's the point exactly

766
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:29,770
yeah but like I told you I mean I'm sure

767
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:32,470
he liked your you understand as well

768
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:34,840
that's that's what I was doing even you

769
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:36,250
know and I get it - I was like okay this

770
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,290
works so I'm gonna keep doing it yeah

771
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:39,940
and it's it's a safe spot ya know

772
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:41,380
especially if you see views dropped and

773
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:44,080
all of a sudden like okay I got to do

774
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:45,460
even more stuff I don't just lucky if it

775
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,230
happens to be something like what you

776
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:49,060
did you found what you wanted to do and

777
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:50,740
luckily that is something everybody

778
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:52,960
wanted as well yeah I think that kind of

779
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:54,280
comes through with I mean that's that's

780
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,600
great for you people just like you for

781
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,230

786
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:05,690
spot and yeah I'm forever grateful but

00:37:36,109 --> 00:37:40,099
uh-huh what how did that even come to I

835
00:37:38,779 --> 00:37:46,369
mean I remember scene I was like oh this

836
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:48,229

837
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:53,089
fought someone else is one of his mates

838
00:37:48,229 --> 00:37:54,710
and I put it as a joke uh I'll fight the

839
00:37:53,089 --> 00:37:57,619
winner and then he took that seriously

840
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:59,059
and then that's how you said it you said

841
00:37:57,619 --> 00:38:02,839
something else you must have made it

842
00:37:59,059 --> 00:38:05,660

843
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:06,289

and I said no it's a joke Claire I don't

846
00:38:08,059 --> 00:38:11,390
want you want to fight you and he's like

847
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:13,009
no no no and then we had a whole press

848
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:16,999
conference and then they go ahead and

849
00:38:13,009 --> 00:38:18,890
right if I happen so yeah and that was

850
00:38:16,999 --> 00:38:22,309
real too I was impressed cause that

851
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:25,249
wasn't planned I was very real for me

852
00:38:22,309 --> 00:38:26,509
it's like because I know you you know I

853
00:38:25,249 --> 00:38:29,450
mean so when I see these videos and

854
00:38:26,509 --> 00:38:31,190
stuff like I don't know he'll be asking

855
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:34,099
me and stuff I'm be like I I don't know

856
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:36,229
I'm gonna ask you that's not how I

857
00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:39,739
usually I got the one with the head the

858
00:38:36,229 --> 00:38:42,410
fire I mean the press conference right

859
00:38:39,739 --> 00:38:45,319
especially like that girl yes so like it

860
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:48,799
was like it was a right between me and

861
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:50,900
him but it wasn't because like we more

862
00:38:48,799 --> 00:38:52,249
like friends friends but you know we

863
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:55,400
knew of each other we different deals

864
00:38:52,249 --> 00:38:58,339
together and then it just not personal

865
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,499
it just turned mine like he just you

866
00:38:58,339 --> 00:39:03,380
know switch something to try and I guess

867
00:39:00,499 --> 00:39:06,019
just ruin room my career essentially I

868
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:08,509
know I just call it so angry and then I

869
00:39:06,019 --> 00:39:11,180
just like lost my [ __ ] and I just went

870
00:39:08,509 --> 00:39:13,670
red I am caught so angry to the point

871
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:14,210
where I was trying to like grab him like

872
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:18,049
hurt him

873
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:21,170
yeah so because he pushed me he did no

874
00:39:18,049 --> 00:39:23,110
he nudged into me and I just as I do

875
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:24,640
what the [ __ ] are you doing

876
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:26,380
we're meant to just have this press

877
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,810
conference and then box didn't leave her

878
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:31,300
at that but he just you know took it way

879
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:32,380
farther with like what was said and why

880
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:37,290
he's the what he did

881
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:39,910
I just lost my [ __ ] to the point where

882
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:42,550
one of the bodyguards tried stopping me

883
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:45,430
and I threw him across the stage and

884
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:47,920
just ripped his suit the body goes yeah

885
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:49,450
fully ripped it and then they got more

886
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,660
and more people just to hold me back

887
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:58,660
and I thought boy I was like I'm going

888
00:39:52,660 --> 00:40:01,030
to do this man I mean yeah yeah for

889
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:04,330
tomorrow I think is the referee stopped

890
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:07,690
early yeah it was taken who started the

891
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:12,400
side men who stir so it it kind of its

892
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:14,290
kind of just for former side man I

893
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:25,390
didn't make sure you this right it's me

894
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:30,310
Simon Josh and Ethan yeah no no I'm Toby

895
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:33,700
so it was all well pretty much we

896
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:35,020
started the GTA group and we were just

897
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:37,660
like I we should just make videos

898
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:39,340
together why why this would be good so I

899
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:41,560
think at the time there was another

900
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:45,460
group and we were just I wish she'd do

901
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:48,720
something similar it was it was do you

902
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:51,460
know like speedy and them all right so

903
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,020
those youtubers I forgot what the group

904
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:55,450
is called but they had like a little

905
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:58,150
group and like oh yeah we should just do

906
00:40:55,450 --> 00:41:01,840
something similar so we had that and I

907
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:04,330
think then Vic wanted to join Vic was

908
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:06,670
quite interested so he did a few videos

909
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:08,380
with him and we weren't called the

910
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:17,380
Seidman at this point we were just doing

911
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:19,470
videos together and then we I think it's

912
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:23,680
so long ago um

913
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:26,800
so Harry was in the community but he

914
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:29,020
wasn't like like we knew of him but we

915
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,100
were told by another youtuber I don't

916
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:32,980
know if I should be saying this

917
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:34,290
oh [ __ ] it's not it's not too bad it's

918
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:36,000
not too bad it's not too bad

919
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:40,790
we were told by another youtuber Knapp

920
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:45,120
to pretty much take Harry under our wing

921
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:49,170
we take Harry under our wing because he

922
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:52,110
was going down like a bad rule with

923
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:55,020
other youtubers which I won't say who

924
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:57,630
but he was going down a bad route with

925
00:41:55,020 --> 00:42:00,030
another other couple of youtubers so

926
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:02,610
Knapp was like oh you should definitely

927
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:05,280
like put her in your group just you know

928
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:06,720
to steer him in the right direction so

929
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,670
we're like yeah yeah sure we'll do it

930
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,260
and you know he was Steve's jokes you

931
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:11,880
know we divisions with him and

932
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:15,530
eventually just like I would you know we

933
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:18,570
should call ourselves something and um

934
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:22,260
yeah we decide Seidman was pretty jokes

935
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:24,570
like just Seidman is kind of like an

936
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:27,840
insult it's not anymore it's right now

937
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:31,680
it's like it's crazy like you'd you get

938
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:33,270
rapped it's always like calling like it

939
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,340
would be an insult to cool someone aside

940
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:38,550
man okay so you have rappers always be

941
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:40,680
saying like my mind's aside manland or

942
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:42,150
your side man this this that you know

943
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:45,690
I'm the main man your side my neck

944
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:48,270
cetera it's now no no rapper says it

945
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:49,770
because of us later because if so many

946
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:51,600
need something else now yeah but

947
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:53,280
literally it's like if you mean the side

948
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:56,280
menu like oh wait you mean the YouTube

949
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:58,200
group sorry it doesn't work it doesn't

950
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,690
work is watching more so it's crazy so

951
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:03,690
we're literally turning the word the

952
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:06,420
insole into just just our group name now

953
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:08,220
but um yeah we decided to just call

954
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:10,140
ourselves the side man this we thought

955
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:12,600
it just be jokes like well assignment of

956
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:14,790
each other's of each other just what I

957
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:17,520
said she's just dissing each other and

958
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:20,040
yeah over time we just just grew and

959
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:25,230
grew and grew and it's crazy yo the

960
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:30,510
Simon almost like wasn't a thing I think

961
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:31,230
is around 2017 is legend when I when I

962
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:33,690
left

963
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:36,570
during that whole period like the

964
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:41,520
sidemen were just like oh just in limbo

965
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:44,190
right like you know Simon and Josh and

966
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,260
Toby and a few others

967
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:48,690
we're still doing videos

968
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:53,430
you know did a few Simon videos here in

969
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:54,750
NAB like GTA and etc but it was like

970
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:57,270
getting to a point where we were like I

971
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:59,580
was might have to and this some point

972
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:01,410
died say yeah just like move on from

973
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:03,540
this whole Simon thing and then the

974
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:06,990
whole dish strikes happened and then

975
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:08,700
from then it was like a huge boom but

976
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:10,859
after that we were like okay we're back

977
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,640
to you know the point where we were

978
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:13,740
before

979
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:16,500
right like yeah we've got all these

980
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:17,970
views but it's like what do we do is

981
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:22,170
each other like what's what's going on

982
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:26,040
and the thing that saved the sideman was

983
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:28,400
a YouTube originals youtuber youtuber

984
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:32,070
original saves the sideman because

985
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,570
because of you two originals we needed

986
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:35,520
we had this seidman channel but we

987
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:37,290
didn't we hardly ever posted any content

988
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,090
uh-huh we didn't have the symbol we have

989
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:43,530
where we have now we post every single

990
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:45,420
week we just had a thing where we would

991
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:48,440
just post like charity matches and

992
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:50,310
that's pretty much it and just you know

993
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,600
what I was pretty yeah that's pretty

994
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:57,210
much it we didn't really post anything

995
00:44:51,600 --> 00:45:00,030
else so we we had the salmon channel

996
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:03,060
like okay you two were like you guys

997
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:06,150
need to have more traffic on this

998
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:09,900
channel for us to like do this side man

999
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:11,490
originals series so okay we have to

1000
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:14,930
think of a plan so we're thinking okay

1001
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:18,270
what would work and we decided would do

1002
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:23,640
videos together every week and post it

1003
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:26,220
every Sunday at the start of 2018 just

1004
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:29,430
to get some traffic right you know onto

1005
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:31,380
the channel and you know over time it

1006
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:32,880
just popped off like it got bigger and

1007
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:35,010
bigger and bigger and then YouTube

1008
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,550
originals happened and now it's like I

1009
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:42,630
was alright it didn't really do much but

1010
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:44,580
we gained so much from it not through

1011
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:45,750
the views of the u2 original like the

1012
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:46,530
YouTube regions didn't really do much

1013
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:49,170
for us

1014
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:51,750
but the stuff around it that helped so

1015
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:55,230
it made us do videos every Sunday right

1016
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:57,359
hey gosh like a rotor you know it goes

1017
00:45:55,230 --> 00:46:01,259
our

1018
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:04,529
Paso manager to like so all of like

1019
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:08,039
stuff it just got a six lead in the

1020
00:46:04,529 --> 00:46:09,900
group we kind of all take charge that's

1021
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:12,150
the political answer no no no we always

1022
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:14,579
take charge like take turns because it's

1023
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:16,229
all like he could like the shares equal

1024
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:18,150
everybody just gets the exact same out

1025
00:46:16,229 --> 00:46:20,160
so we all have to pull our weight yeah

1026
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:21,749
so sometimes you're so on this and

1027
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,369
pulling that weight we just get on them

1028
00:46:21,749 --> 00:46:25,619
and we're just like yo you know put that

1029
00:46:23,369 --> 00:46:29,880
weight and then they'll pull that weight

1030
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:31,529
and then that's it and saw it yeah how

1031
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,029
does a large group like that cuz wrong I

1032
00:46:31,529 --> 00:46:33,479
think from what I've heard I could be

1033
00:46:33,029 --> 00:46:35,309
wrong

1034
00:46:33,479 --> 00:46:37,829
everybody has to come up with a video

1035
00:46:35,309 --> 00:46:39,989
idea yeah well and they're in charge of

1036
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:44,279
that we kind of we kind of come together

1037
00:46:39,989 --> 00:46:46,920
and we think of ideas and so yeah some

1038
00:46:44,279 --> 00:46:50,279
people are better ideas than others but

1039
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:53,849
we were like I you know for me I had an

1040
00:46:50,279 --> 00:46:57,319
idea to do it in the video real-life -

1041
00:46:53,849 --> 00:47:00,329
in the video where us seven side men

1042
00:46:57,319 --> 00:47:02,940
we're in the line and we have a girl

1043
00:47:00,329 --> 00:47:05,099
several girls come in and they would

1044
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:07,769
just rate us so they would like swipe

1045
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:08,190
right or swipe left and if they swipe

1046
00:47:07,769 --> 00:47:10,979
left

1047
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:13,619
we asked them why and we thought it'd be

1048
00:47:10,979 --> 00:47:18,989
funny just you know see what reason for

1049
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:20,999
why girls would want to swipe swipe left

1050
00:47:18,989 --> 00:47:22,619
to us think so it's so like just stuff

1051
00:47:20,999 --> 00:47:25,079
like that and then I'll just set it all

1052
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:28,949
up I'm you know make sure the studios

1053
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:32,309
are sawing Tanya who's our personal

1054
00:47:28,949 --> 00:47:36,269
manager helps so much she is literally

1055
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:38,880
the rock in the side man like she just

1056
00:47:36,269 --> 00:47:41,609
makes sure makes everything work without

1057
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:46,739
her we just be all over the place so she

1058
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:49,289
is like the best and we got her from the

1059
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:53,339
YouTube originals she was already she's

1060
00:47:49,289 --> 00:47:55,650
working with a company that was working

1061
00:47:53,339 --> 00:47:57,359
with the whole you to originals and we

1062
00:47:55,650 --> 00:48:00,359
were just like yo like do you want to be

1063
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:02,969
our personal manager and she's four by

1064
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:04,769
it it's just like [ __ ] it let's go let's

1065
00:48:02,969 --> 00:48:05,460
see what happens and now she's like over

1066
00:48:04,769 --> 00:48:08,460
the moon

1067
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:10,619
and yeah like just stuff like that's

1068
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:13,339
well that's that's probably partly why

1069
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:15,660
the sidemen is just thriving like and

1070
00:48:13,339 --> 00:48:18,510
why were in just such a good position

1071
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:21,480
and it's crazy like in 2017 we were

1072
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:22,559
close to like just ending it yeah yeah

1073
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,079
that's crazy

1074
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:26,460
it's something that like seems so small

1075
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:29,130
it's just like the catalyst for like

1076
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:32,119
great yeah youtubers who will follow

1077
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:34,260
YouTube originals yeah save the Seidman

1078
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:38,010
they're gonna take that quote and like

1079
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:40,440
use it out of everything like we did

1080
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:41,460
this you're welcome but they can't use

1081
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,980
this you know because then you can

1082
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:46,050
copyright strike them yeah

1083
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:48,930
monetization I wouldn't be surprised if

1084
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:50,550
this gets copyright actually I that's

1085
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:52,920
that's an interesting thing

1086
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:55,650
copyright monetization copywriting

1087
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:58,290
things and monetization because both of

1088
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:59,609
you guys your demographics are that's a

1089
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:01,349
pretty different and the content that

1090
00:48:59,609 --> 00:49:05,309
you put out is very different you're a

1091
00:49:01,349 --> 00:49:06,930
lot edgier yeah I yeah Ryan is is more

1092
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:09,710
safe you know like on the fence and

1093
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:12,030
stuff um how do you deal with

1094
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:13,710
monetization on things cuz without the I

1095
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:14,880
dare you that we all did together you

1096
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:17,040
just said that guide to monetize right

1097
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:21,569
it I well first I think it got age

1098
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:23,609
restricted and then I mean a lot of the

1099
00:49:21,569 --> 00:49:24,540
ideas I mean I get it because it's like

1100
00:49:23,609 --> 00:49:26,220
now they're trying to say like if

1101
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:28,079
anything that is considered dangerous

1102
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:30,480
even though we have a disclaimer in the

1103
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,170
beginning I mean they're just looking

1104
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:36,059
out for themselves

1105
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:38,069
mmm yeah but um well I like so I have

1106
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:43,559
two channels on my main channel I don't

1107
00:49:38,069 --> 00:49:46,020
really get to monetize or claimed much

1108
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:48,599
because a lot of content there now it's

1109
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:51,480
just original stuff and I we make sure

1110
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:54,920
like there's no like operates yeah but

1111
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:58,290
you like swear and you're just like yeah

1112
00:49:54,920 --> 00:50:02,430
it's I think I doesn't get to monetize

1113
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:05,130
though like I think um so I think

1114
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:08,520
swearing is alright if it's you know

1115
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:11,220
like - if it's not too crazy and I think

1116
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:12,750
YouTube definitely like the whole skits

1117
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:15,599
and like music when it comes to music

1118
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:17,950
and skits they're quite lenient yeah

1119
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:21,640
whereas my second channel I've

1120
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:23,859
like I get destroyed yeah I because I'm

1121
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:25,900
just like myself and YouTube they're

1122
00:50:23,859 --> 00:50:27,339
like nope s'alright don't be yourself

1123
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:30,250
yeah yeah I do

1124
00:50:27,339 --> 00:50:33,460
one question go I get to monetize and

1125
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:35,530
you know like I do reaction videos and I

1126
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:38,220
get copyright claims and the monetize so

1127
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:41,740
it's literally like it's hard to like

1128
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:44,109
make any money on my second channel I

1129
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:45,790
like I just that's what the second

1130
00:50:44,109 --> 00:50:47,950
channel for yeah it's just waiting out

1131
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:50,920
stuff I just want I just want to just do

1132
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:53,079
like and I feel like for me it just

1133
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:55,300
makes so much sense I it just works in

1134
00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:56,950
my head to have like premium content on

1135
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:59,740
my main channel and in my second term I

1136
00:50:56,950 --> 00:51:03,280
can just sit back and just not care and

1137
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:07,200
just do a [ __ ] out one right so I think

1138
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:12,700
it's just like AI just White's me so

1139
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:16,599
well no we know yeah we need to swear

1140
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:19,680
and not be ourselves and do original

1141
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:21,670
things do original things there's a

1142
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,720
second channel we just got to start

1143
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:25,900
dropping bombs

1144
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:27,940
I know get more that's so inconsistent

1145
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:32,319
though cuz yeah I heard that I don't

1146
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:34,420
really get like we get but like even

1147
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:38,319
like in the negative right now if you

1148
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:40,690

00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:09,190
claimed is it just like copyright claims

1159
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:10,990
there's some call a lot of a lot of

1160
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:13,660
copyright claim from previous like stuff

1161
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:18,190
in the past yeah pretty good about that

1162
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:19,930
now yeah we have to be you know and a

1163
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:22,890
lot of things like is it's it's

1164
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:25,270
debatable and I could you know maybe

1165
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:26,770
fight it but it's like it's such a

1166
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:28,859
process yeah you know at that point I'm

1167
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:31,500
just like I'm just gonna stop doing that

1168
00:52:28,859 --> 00:52:33,480
but yeah I mean I get it a lot and then

1169
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:35,760
I heard I mean that had a title once

1170
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:38,280
where it has like F asterisk asterisk

1171
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:42,150
asterisk in it mmm and that gets like oh

1172
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:45,120
it's demonetised yeah and it's old video

1173
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:48,030
even a podcast that had M om oh oh yeah

1174
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:49,470
oh yeah yeah well because when that was

1175
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:51,360
going on we talked about it we're not

1176
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:55,380
promoting it because the title that

1177
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:57,270
podcast got like instantly did yeah yeah

1178
00:52:55,380 --> 00:53:00,030
I don't even think it was a person it's

1179
00:52:57,270 --> 00:53:03,330
just the system yeah Yugi would just

1180
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:05,340
turn the cover there oh yeah yeah all

1181
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:07,140
those type of things I see their

1182
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:10,680
perspective because people are coming at

1183
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:12,390
them but they're it's I think if they

1184
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:15,030
keep going down this path it's just

1185
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:16,710
gonna ruin it I think it's gonna be so

1186
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:19,680
boring all the contents gonna be so

1187
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:23,130
tense 'red yeah yeah it's crazy like

1188
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:26,340
compared to like where YouTube was years

1189
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:29,190
ago is now it's it's if anything it's

1190
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:31,140
becoming really like TV yeah yeah with

1191
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:32,850
the censorship and what you can and

1192
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:34,290
can't say right well when money gets

1193
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:38,220
involved then people start caring about

1194
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:40,170
this that's a all right well I mean we

1195
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:41,820

1196
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:44,880

1211
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:21,090

I'm just so particular and it just

1223
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:55,170
doesn't work for like especially with

1224
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,780

1226
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:01,230

things have just got really really busy

1228
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:07,410
but you get really hung over

1229
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:10,710
I just use as an excuse I was just there

1230
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:13,370

anything

1301
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:40,950
damn I get a lot of enquiries like Josh

1302
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:43,500
Trey Leah and Southeast Asia India even

1303
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:45,000
but not that many from the U and we have

1304
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:48,540
a decent viewership out there but we

1305
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:50,910
have we have a VidCon in the UK yeah and

1306
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:52,980
I guess the final Twitter question is

1307
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:56,730
from Andy Tien it's better be a good one

1308
00:58:52,980 --> 00:59:00,140
Andy who it is as oh jeez of YouTube

1309
00:58:56,730 --> 00:59:03,060
oh how difficult old was it to

1310
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:04,770
transition to a different kind of

1311
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:06,869
content from the one you've started with

1312
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:09,260
we talked about that I mean you did

1313
00:59:06,869 --> 00:59:10,820
right it's going does mommy did FIFA yes

1314
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:12,500
I saw a fever and then I was just like I

1315
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:15,230
don't be doing FIFA with my life's I

1316
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:17,120
just I mean you have to be a bit more

1317
00:59:15,230 --> 00:59:20,300
tactical with it you have to like slowly

1318
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:22,370
feed in all the content to the point I'd

1319
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:24,080
still like release the main content that

1320
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:25,820
you're putting out just so people like

1321
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:28,400
oh what are you doing no this is all

1322
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:30,980
like no go back to what you're used to

1323
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,390
but I yeah a lot of time you just have

1324
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:35,240
to ignore people like people always

1325
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:39,410
gonna say [ __ ] until eventually like

1326
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:42,020
they just go away or you just find new

1327
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:43,520
audience yeah love both things that

1328
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:45,290
you're doing and then you find an

1329
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:48,140
audience I love all the things that you

1330
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:50,180
like you want to do etc so and I think

1331
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:52,340
for you because they're there for your

1332
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:53,780
personality yeah so you know it doesn't

1333
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:55,580
really mother yeah they're there for you

1334
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:58,580
no matter you could watch paint dry and

1335
00:59:55,580 --> 01:00:00,410
make that exciting no it's true

1336
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:01,670
yeah that's just your person on and

1337
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:03,290
that's something that you have like that

1338
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:04,670
you're one of your talents you've

1339
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:07,400
definitely grown that and push that side

1340
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:09,380
of you yes I feel like just YouTube has

1341
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:11,060
slight helped tremendously with that

1342
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:14,330
yeah over the time look just

1343
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:16,580
you always charismatic as ago no I was

1344
01:00:14,330 --> 01:00:18,440
very into red really extremely

1345
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:21,770
introverted as you were when you were

1346
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:24,590
growing up yes I mean I didn't talk to

1347
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:27,410
girls like I remember there was a time I

1348
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:31,940
think it was like yeah what year was it

1349
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:36,680
year 12 so I was around 16 17 I think so

1350
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:39,260
- 18 and a go came a girl just walk past

1351
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:42,500
me and I really liked her so I said hi

1352
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:43,130
and she said hi back and I just shot

1353
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:45,440
myself

1354
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:49,040
I think seriously hot was being and

1355
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:50,960
everything I didn't I was like oh god

1356
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:52,760
it's gonna sound so lame but I would

1357
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:56,450
always like go on Google how to talk to

1358
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:59,240
girls and like what to say after hi and

1359
01:00:56,450 --> 01:01:01,340
yeah literally is the worst I didn't

1360
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:04,490
know what I remember I went on a date

1361
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:11,780
and I like wrote stuff in my hand like

1362
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:14,840
things to say so you know like Oh mal

1363
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:15,920
just get so nervous non-web I said what

1364
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:18,740
did you learn that how do you talk to

1365
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:21,130
girls uh well it was the most important

1366
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:21,130
thing I guess

1367
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:27,650
it's not like it's you kind of just have

1368
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:30,290
to experience it you can't like there

1369
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:33,890
isn't like it go - yeah like before I

1370
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:36,140
always looked a simple pickup and stuff

1371
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:37,850
like that and just be like okay how how

1372
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:40,210
do they pick up girls and how they make

1373
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:42,500
make it look so easy unless you just

1374
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:43,670
experience and just you know you build

1375
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:45,020
up the confidence or would you like

1376
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:46,730
failed a lot you made a lot of guys

1377
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:48,080
saying you just have to fail yeah just

1378
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:50,930
have to go in and fail to the point

1379
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:52,010
where well I felt so many times I can't

1380
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:53,600
get any worse than this and then

1381
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:55,520
eventually just go up from there and

1382
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:58,250
yeah you just I just got more

1383
01:01:55,520 --> 01:02:02,480
comfortable and then yeah I started just

1384
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:07,430
going home with look at you know you got

1385
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:08,990
a girlfriend and yeah six guy friends so

1386
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:12,080
clearly something is working right

1387
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:15,800
working out yeah Simon in the side

1388
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:18,050
chicks don't let her see I'm just

1389
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:19,580
kidding I'm making a joke she's like

1390
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:21,830
what just nothing okay

1391
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:23,360
I mean she watches this is like what

1392
01:02:21,830 --> 01:02:26,450
just sent her that Clinton made I guess

1393
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:27,740
like the main stuff yeah so but like she

1394
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:30,890
would never watch the whole of this you

1395
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:32,420
guys have too much content okay no I

1396
01:02:30,890 --> 01:02:34,070
mean this is Demi you got to be like

1397
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:36,350
there's a certain demographic to have to

1398
01:02:34,070 --> 01:02:40,660
watch a pocket or listen to a pop she's

1399
01:02:36,350 --> 01:02:44,120
just busy with oh yeah yeah yeah see

do you like green also I think the the

1409
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:12,260
cool thing that that applies to us is a

1410
01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:13,790
lot of your older viewers are like oh am

1411
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:16,250

01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:25,640
to watch every single video and I mean I

1417
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:27,800
