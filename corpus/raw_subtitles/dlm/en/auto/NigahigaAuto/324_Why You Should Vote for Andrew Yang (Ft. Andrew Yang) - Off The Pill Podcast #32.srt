1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I am one of the few candidates in the

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,069
field that Donald Trump has never

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,990
tweeted at or acknowledged for a young

4
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:08,280
person now you're looking at a less than

5
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,080
fifty percent chance of doing better

6
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,550
than your parents I will share what's

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:17,150
going on with aliens of the American

while like I've been looking forward to

27
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,670
this for a while I've been wondering do

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,080
you actually run your Twitter because I

29
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,080
was wondering if I was talking to you in

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,850
you know Indians or is it someone else

31
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,210
it's me with a little plus sign next to

32
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,159
it like dip in there and do stuff yeah

33
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,720
well like the tweets of all like like

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,430
you were talking about like the like

35
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,320
basketball and football is that I'm a

36
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,759
second only me okay

37
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,939
I'd be very troubled if someone else

38
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:32,700
pretended to take over my sports fan

39
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:38,790
don't make me like you know 49ers

40
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:41,369
panting some [ __ ] I just yeah I mean

41
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:46,290
you know my teams are terrible Jets its

42
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:47,490
Jets Mets Oh Nets I suppose you'd have

43
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,520
to say no I was a long time they

44
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:52,439
transfer my entire life until they

45
00:01:50,520 --> 00:02:00,750
dumped jeremy'll and honestly and then I

46
00:01:52,439 --> 00:02:02,610
was like [ __ ] this [ __ ] was a bright

47
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,310
brightest spot of being a Knicks fan for

48
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:07,350
years and then they drop him and then

49
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,789
you're like why did you drop him and

50
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,379
you'd put up with so much stuff leading

51
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:11,849
up to that time so then I became a Nets

52
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:12,450
fan because Jeremy okay I was playing

53
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:15,270
there and

54
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:17,730
and you left and now I'm still in that

55
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:21,000
span because now I'm friendly with the

56
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:22,590
incoming owner Joe Tai who's Oh

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,870
Taiwanese Canadian I don't know if you

58
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,680
know about this I know the ownerships

59
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,340
changing right

60
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,130
the ownerships changing from Prokhorov

61
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,380
the russian oligarch who spent money to

62
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:38,849
Joe Toye who's like this Taiwanese

63
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,870
Canadian badass he's essentially like he

64
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:41,340
went to high school in college in

65
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,160
America so he's essentially in my mind

66
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,340
like you know pretty American but he's

67
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,060
gonna be the first Asian and be a owner

68
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,830
I believe

69
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,390
oh really yeah so he's gonna own the

70
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,690
Brooklyn Nets so if you have no sports

71
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:57,030
allegiance in the NBA and you're you

72
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,370
know like opened a new team and might be

73
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,110
the Brooklyn Nets okay okay well that's

74
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,000
I mean that's I didn't even know that

75
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:06,450
honestly I'm a bad agent for not knowing

76
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,410
that so you you were a fan of Jeremy Lin

77
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,410
like you say how do you feel about mail

78
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,599
then oh you know I mean now Melo is that

79
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:14,610
a bad rap Tamala should clearly be in

80
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:17,459
the league and I hope the Nets sign him

81
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,769
but at the time when they dumped Jeremy

82
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,959
Lin you know that you had this a little

83
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:23,850
bit of the sense that Melo was not too

84
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,560
upset that they dumped Lin and said it

85
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:28,260
was a period when I was sort of sad

86
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:32,670
about Melo okay so it's true you do

87
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:34,370
actually watch basketball clearly I was

88
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,780
always wondering you know you never know

89
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:39,060
you know if you had a basketball

90
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,739
ghostwriter yeah that'd be pretty

91
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,150
difficult oh one of the reasons why I

92
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:46,530
wanted to come on with you all is that

93
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:48,510
that I'm really a pretty normal dude I

94
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,829
mean you'd have to be a fairly weird

95
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,799
person run for president so there is

96
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:56,730
that one thing but the things that you

97
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,200
like I probably like to I think that's

98
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,690
one of the reasons why I mean I'd

99
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,620
gravitate towards I mean I I told you

100
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,389
from the very beginning like I don't

101
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,170
know why you would want to be on the

102
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:06,269
show because I don't know much about

103
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:09,599
politics and you said that's exactly why

104
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:10,950
you want to do it well first Asian

105
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,889
Americans are not that into politics

106
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,750
generally we vote at lower levels we

107
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:17,430
donate money at lower levels we run for

108
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,720
office at lower levels and I tell people

109
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,250
very plainly it's like when you're

110
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,810
growing up and certainly the way I grew

111
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,669
up it's not like your parents were like

112
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,970
you're gonna be President someday it was

113
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:28,120
I get good grades

114
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:33,100
make a good living do something reliable

115
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:34,660
and consistent and politics is not

116
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,310
something certainly I was emphasized in

117
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,980
my household I think that's true in most

118
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,960
Asian Americans households and so one

119
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,660
thing I'm grateful for is that I think

120
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,370
my campaign can help energize Asian

121
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,050
Americans in a different way but if you

122
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,430
arrive to the scene like you just said

123
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:52,540
where you're not that into politics that

124
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:53,890
would be totally normal and to me it's

125
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,920
one of the you know the things I'd like

126
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:58,750
to help change because if we don't get

127
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,010
politically engaged at some point then

128
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,260
things are just gonna keep on changing

129
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:05,200
in ways then we might not like mm-hmm

130
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,880
yeah I mean I think the only time that I

131
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,130
really got into it was when Trump was

132
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,510
running right so I I mean that's when I

133
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,310
finally was like kind of getting

134
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,580
interested and I guess that's the one

135
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,630
thing you can say that he did do is

136
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,490
bring a lot of injuries I mean like you

137
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:21,070
said it's like a reality show and he's a

138
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:23,770
star so he got a lot of people to care

139
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:25,570
about politics now let's say that and

140
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:27,610
then now again talking to a lot of my

141
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:29,860
friends they all know who you are nice

142
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,720
they do they do but I will say there is

143
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,040
some pessimism where they everybody

144
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,419
keeps telling me cuz I don't really know

145
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,460
that much and I'm a certain they do know

146
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:38,020
more they keep telling me like yeah we

147
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:42,669
love Andrew yang but there's no way he's

148
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:44,080
gonna win well stranger things have

149
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:46,960
happened in American politics that's for

150
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,150
sure so right now I'm at 3%

151
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,250
nationally and I was five percent in one

152
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,530
state poll and just like the people

153
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:56,560
watching this right now most folks in

154
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:57,760
Iowa New Hampshire have not tuned in and

155
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,260
have no idea who they're voting for

156
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,870
right so anyone who tells you that they

157
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:05,350
know what's gonna happen is lying

158
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:07,030
because no one knows better what data

159
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:10,419
you have a you know you have your hands

160
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:12,760
on and the fact that we've gone from

161
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:14,800
nowhere to 6:00 in the polls and I'm

162
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:18,070
gonna be on the debate stage in Houston

163
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,200
this week to me that's actually a harder

164
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:22,300
leap to make than being in sixth place

165
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,820
raising millions of dollars being in all

166
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:28,450
the mainstream news outlets and then

167
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:30,070
going from 6 to 1st in part because the

168
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:32,200
honest truth is that if you look at

169
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:34,840
Canada the candidates who are above me

170
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,180
people have reservations about frankly

171
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,800
all of them well use nobody thought

172
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,629
those same people who said no the

173
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,789
no way Trump was gonna win so right

174
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:43,960
there was a point when there was a lot

175
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:45,909
there were a lot of people that said

176
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,250
there's no bomb was gonna win yeah you

177
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:49,900
know and I said too it's like no you

178
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,550
guys this is gonna date me a little bit

179
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,349
Bill Clinton kind of came out of nowhere

180
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:55,710
he was like the No Name governor in

181
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:58,150
Arkansas no one was like Clinton's gonna

182
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:59,830
Clinton's gonna come and save the day

183
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,659
like so

184
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:03,069
stranger things have happened in

185
00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:06,879
American politics than my becoming

186
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:09,129
president in 2020 right you're one of

187
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,960
your main messages in your campaign is

188
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:12,969
you be I'm sure you've talked about it a

189
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,409
million times but for some of our

190
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:16,150
listeners that don't really know what

191
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:19,150
that is we have a lot of young younger

192
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:21,219
listeners what what exactly is that so

193
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:23,500
you know universal basic income is a

194
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:25,000
policy where every citizen gets a

195
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,340
certain amount of money to meet your

196
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,900
basic needs to do whatever you want with

197
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:31,300
so my plan the freedom dividend would

198
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:33,729
put $1,000 a month into the hands of

199
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,690
every American starting at age 18 so if

200
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:36,969
you're 18

201
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:39,280
you'd get $1,000 a month if you're 16

202
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:41,069
and you wait two years you'd get $1,000

203
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,630
a month and that seems incredibly

204
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:47,919
dramatic but this was a plan that was

205
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:50,349
approved by the House of Representatives

206
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,699
in the US Congress in 1971 this was a

207
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:54,789
plan that was championed by Martin

208
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:57,009
Luther King in 1968 this is a plan that

209
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:59,440
has sort of been adopted in one state

210
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:01,150
Alaska where everyone in Alaska gets

211
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,880
between one and two thousand dollars a

212
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:06,099
year in oil money so if you were family

213
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,599
at four you're getting $8,000 in Alaska

214
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:10,270
and what I'm saying to the American

215
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:13,210
people is that technology is the oil of

216
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:15,460
the 21st century we're now your data our

217
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,750
data is worth more than oil and and

218
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:20,440
that's a true fact

219
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:22,300
and you all in many ways are an example

220
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,919
of this 21st century economy and here we

221
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:28,840
are in your beautiful Southern

222
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:30,930
California David's house Home Slice

223
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:34,120
studio but I mean it's awesome like this

224
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:36,159
conversation is going to be seen or

225
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,959
heard by hundreds of thousands maybe

226
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,940
millions of people I mean that that's

227
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:42,399
something that's very recent it's like a

228
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,750
new innovation and there are many things

229
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,540
that are happening in our economy that

230
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,820
are unprecedented so if we cling to this

231
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:51,640
notion that everyone's gonna work a

232
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,390
nine-to-five and you're paid in twelve

233
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,130
bucks an hour and

234
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:56,230
it's gonna work out it's gonna work out

235
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:58,690
for fewer and fewer people over time and

236
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:01,240
in my view this is why Donald Trump won

237
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:02,440
in 2016 is that more and more Americans

238
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,930
are feeling like it's not working for

239
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,180
them mm-hmm well I mean again those same

240
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:08,650
people keep because I asked them because

241
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,330
I want to know like Oh what questions

242
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:12,340
should I ask cuz I don't know enough a

243
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:14,890
lot of them and I've seen your answer to

244
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:17,170
how are you gonna pay for this and you

245
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:19,030
bring up Amazon and the VAT tax I don't

246
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,170
completely understand what a VAT tax is

247
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:23,410
can you explain that

248
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:26,020
like really dumb down though sure so

249
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:27,790
Amazon's a trillion dollar tech company

250
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:30,700
paying zero in taxes right now less than

251
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:33,250
I mean you all you know pay much more

252
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,960
than zero percent I'm sure and so that's

253
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,450
not an exaggeration they're paying zero

254
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:46,540
they're paying zero oh yeah that's not

255
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:47,770
like zero is not a number so and it's

256
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,270
not unusual like if you look at their

257
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:51,820
lifetime taxation rate it's something

258
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:55,900
like three percent so there'll be zero

259
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:57,940
in some years five in others so you have

260
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,530
to ask yourself okay you're gonna have a

261
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,150
revenue problem in this country if your

262
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:03,390
biggest companies are paying zero are

263
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:06,040
near zero in taxes and it's not just

264
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:08,350
Amazon it's Google its Facebook its

265
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,760
Netflix Netflix also paid zero in taxes

266
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:12,430
last year so these are some of the

267
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,860
biggest companies in our society and so

268
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,570
then you look at it and say okay why are

269
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,770
they paying zero and the reason they're

270
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,360
paying zero is we have a corporate

271
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:22,750
income tax system that is pretty easy to

272
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,100
game you pay your executives a lot and

273
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,080
stock compensation you can expense that

274
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,420
you have a global business you can push

275
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,460
all of the earnings through Ireland or

276
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:33,250
the Caymans or a Bahamas or whatever the

277
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:35,740
heck and so these companies play a lot

278
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:37,240
of games and so then you look and say

279
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,080
well what did other countries do when

280
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,570
they were faced with the same situation

281
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,370
and every other advanced economy in the

282
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:46,630
world has something called a value-added

283
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:49,270
tax where if you're selling something

284
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:51,130
then you pay a toll and so if you

285
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:53,980
imagine that in Amazon's case then all

286
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:55,690
of a sudden you'd have a lot of tax

287
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,580
revenue very very quickly because they

288
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:01,060
sell a lot of stuff so instead of zero

289
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:02,890
in taxes you would get billions and so

290
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,660
that's the change I want to make and the

291
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:06,130
trick with my plan is that I want to

292
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,980
take the billions we get from Amazon

293
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:11,110
and then give it to us in the form of

294
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,160
$1,000 a month so then if you get this

295
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,899
money what are you gonna spend it on

296
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,970
you're gonna spend a little bit of it on

297
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:19,300
Amazon again but you're gonna spend on

298
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:23,529
other things you want like in your case

299
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:27,190
it might be food clothing education a

300
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:28,540
car something along those lines and then

301
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:31,180
that money just flows back into the

302
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:34,480
economy and ends up creating a virtuous

303
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:36,279
cycle and so that the plan is to try and

304
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,949
get more of the value into our hands and

305
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:41,259
then take a toll when we're spending

306
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:43,480
money with companies like Amazon so what

307
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:45,910
what happens then if so do you plan on

308
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:49,420
imposing some some rules and regulations

309
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:51,160
so that these big corporations can't you

310
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,959
know create companies like in the Cayman

311
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,399
Islands or Ireland like you mentioned

312
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,740
well this is the beauty of a David that

313
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,329
if they decide to move themselves they

314
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:01,420
came in Islands and then they celled us

315
00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:03,100
a still have to pay the toll that's why

316
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:07,660
these other countries have done this and

317
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:09,970
it's like oxygen it's much harder to

318
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,160
game because these companies are very

319
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:15,339
smart and they're very good at avoiding

320
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,949
paying taxes sure so how much revenue

321
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:21,160
can be generated from taxing these big

322
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:22,930
corporations the the estimates are that

323
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,790
if you were to adopt a value-added tax

324
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,829
at half the European level you would

325
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:29,680
generate about 800 billion in new

326
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:32,230
revenue per year in the United States

327
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,750
which is enough to pay for a lot of

328
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,459
things and it's enough to pay for a lot

329
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:40,060
of this thousand dollars a month that's

330
00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:41,410
coming to each of us and then the beauty

331
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,449
of this thousand dollars a month

332
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,829
dividend that we all have is that when

333
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:47,110
we spend it it just ends up making the

334
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:49,360
economy work better generates another

335
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:52,079
hundreds of billions in new revenue

336
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,550
because your economy has more jobs and

337
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,550
activity so we get some of that money

338
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:59,980
back we also save money on things like

339
00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:01,839
jails and hospitals and homelessness

340
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:06,069
services because a lot of those people

341
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:08,949
need less help and then we're making our

342
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:11,139
people stronger healthier mentally

343
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:13,089
healthier more productive also more

344
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:14,350
entrepreneurial and artistic because if

345
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:15,910
you imagine a country where everyone's

346
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,139
getting a thousand bucks a month how do

347
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,279
more people would want to do what you

348
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:22,389
guys are doing right now

349
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:24,490
absolutely working for necessity yeah

350
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:26,560
also not worried about literally like

351
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,810
starving the next month and I've been a

352
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:32,050
serial entrepreneur now for years and

353
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:33,850
years it is almost never the case that

354
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:35,379
someone's like oh my gosh I'm down to my

355
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:38,170
last dime you know I'm gonna do I'm

356
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:40,120
gonna start a business the way it works

357
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:42,569
it's really like when you start a

358
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,069
business often you have a little bit of

359
00:13:42,569 --> 00:13:47,319
security and you feel like you can take

360
00:13:45,069 --> 00:13:51,459
a risk so we do is we making our entire

361
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:53,370
culture more entrepreneurial and more

362
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:55,540
enterprising mm-hmm so this is for

363
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:56,949
millionaires and billionaires they still

364
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,779
get the same thousand dollars a month

365
00:13:56,949 --> 00:14:00,160
well the way the system works is that

366
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:02,980
someone like Jeff Bezos would end up

367
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,959
paying hundreds of millions into the

368
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,189
system and so if we try and send them a

369
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:12,129
thousand bucks a month to remind them

370
00:14:06,189 --> 00:14:13,389
he's an American he probably take it too

371
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:17,379
because you know rich people didn't get

372
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:19,209
to being rich by turning that money so

373
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:22,029
there's some some people here saying

374
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:24,639
that you are a socialist what do you

375
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:26,500
have to say to those people well I'm a

376
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,110
serial entrepreneur who's run businesses

377
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,910
and what I say to people is that this is

378
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:33,250
not socialism this is capitalism where

379
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:35,319
income doesn't start at zero us having

380
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,089
money it's good for businesses it's good

381
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:39,069
for markets it's good for consumers and

382
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:40,689
then if you were to get technical and

383
00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:43,809
very Asian and smart you would say the

384
00:14:40,689 --> 00:14:46,000
definition of socialism is when nation's

385
00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:47,529
government takes over the means of

386
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,579
production which is not what anyone's

387
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:50,980
talking about here what I'm talking

388
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:53,920
about is sliding some money to us we're

389
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:55,300
the owners of the country and so this

390
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,120
money is gonna go back into the economy

391
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:00,399
I see you really seem to like running

392
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,120
with the the Asian stereotypes I have no

393
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,139
issue with it

394
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,519
but I can see some people being

395
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:06,639
sensitive about that especially other

396
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:10,449
Asians and is there is that intention or

397
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:12,040
is that just always been you like no

398
00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:13,449
math thing and then you know talking

399
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,490
about like like you just said you're an

400
00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:16,779
Asian I'm Asian that likes math I mean

401
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:19,240
this is just playing along because you

402
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:20,679
know you know middle America is gonna I

403
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,249
mean there's a certain way they view

404
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:25,629
Asian people right yeah so I know that

405
00:15:24,249 --> 00:15:28,149
we have a very diverse community and

406
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:30,090
that the model minority myth is not an

407
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:34,100
accurate depiction of the way

408
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:38,040
many many or most Asian Americans

409
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:39,980
experience life and so certainly the

410
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,990
last thing I'd want to do is somehow

411
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:45,750
perpetuate stereotypes that aren't you

412
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:47,040
know like helpful to the community but I

413
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:51,180
think most people can tell that I'm

414
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,890
joking they are serious but they're

415
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,810
positive ones and you definitely know

416
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:58,500
your math that's for sure thanks man

417
00:15:54,810 --> 00:16:00,690
so so I think people generally know that

418
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:05,340
like I'm sort of poking fun at both

419
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:07,020
myself and the images and yeah it's like

420
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:10,560
most people taking the same spirit right

421
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:11,820
but I think like you know I mean just

422
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,620
based off the internet I'm sure you see

423
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,600
voices and opinions from everyone I'm

424
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:18,030
thinking like when you become the

425
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,500
nominee right don't you think that's

426
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:21,330
gonna be used against you a lot like I

427
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,220
mean even I can just picture like Trump

428
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:25,110
being like you know how are you gonna

429
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:29,340
work with China conflict of interest you

430
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:31,250
know well our office has a wager on what

431
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:34,680
his nickname is gonna be for me and

432
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:36,930
we've come up with comrade yang okay

433
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:42,360
because it's a little racist a little

434
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:44,460
like communist socialist and I think

435
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,410
people are going to realize that it's

436
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,430
not gonna work so well on me and part

437
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:49,020
because if you listen to me for five

438
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,370
seconds like I sound like the least

439
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,260
socialist dude around because I'm

440
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:55,940
literally like you know like an

441
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:59,760
entrepreneur who's run businesses and I

442
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:02,250
think the anti Asian thing is also a

443
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,750
real loser for him you know what's

444
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,460
really interesting is that I am one of

445
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,320
the few candidates in the field that

446
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:10,890
Donald Trump has never tweeted at or

447
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:12,660
acknowledged and he said something at a

448
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,610
rally in West Virginia where he said

449
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,140
he's excited to run against all the

450
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:17,670
Democrats and his only concern is that

451
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:22,800
someone new comes out of nowhere

452
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:24,630
mm-hm and that's me I'm a similar

453
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,120
profile that I'm from outside the system

454
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:30,530
and I am one of only two candidates in

455
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,460
the field that over ten percent of

456
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:35,400
Donald Trump voters said that they would

457
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:38,370
support and so that means if I'm the

458
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,170
Democratic nominee we win in part

459
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:42,020
because the attacks that he would use on

460
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:44,080
politicians don't really work on me

461
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,880
speaking of Donald Trump and

462
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,269
10% now you mentioned how do you plan on

463
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:52,570
reaching out to the the rest of the 90

464
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:54,190
no I I'm one of the candidates who's

465
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:56,679
willing to go on fox like talk to people

466
00:17:54,190 --> 00:18:00,039
from different yeah parts of the aisle

467
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:01,630
and I can make you know it's been fun

468
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:03,490
it's like I've been meeting tons of

469
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:07,210
Trump voters campaigning around the

470
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:09,159
country and a lot of them like me in

471
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:11,890
part because they can tell that I'm not

472
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:14,019
really talking down to them in any way

473
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:16,779
like I just look at them like hey yeah

474
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:18,220
like some of the [ __ ] really sucks like

475
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:19,950
we gotta try and solve some problems

476
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:22,630
like oh that's different

477
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:24,100
oh dude even in the debates you talked

478
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,510
about it not having like everybody was

479
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,940
talking about you not having a tie you

480
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:30,190
know and how why does that matter

481
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:32,049
so much like why is that it as important

482
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:33,159
especially Brian Williams man what the

483
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:37,720
heck's with Brian Williams and his

484
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:40,720
fixation on neckwear well I mean I think

485
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,309
that's what what I mean that's my for

486
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,990
once I feel like when I'm watching the

487
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:45,370
debates and I hear you talk I feel like

488
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,230
for me personally I'm actually

489
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:49,059
interested and I tried to figure out am

490
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,289
i biased because you're Asian or is it

491
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:52,630
just because the way you

492
00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:53,500
I don't know pretty much just seemed

493
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,149
like a normal person

494
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,309
it doesn't seem staged if that makes

495
00:18:55,149 --> 00:18:59,380
sense I'm sure you're calculating yeah

496
00:18:57,309 --> 00:19:00,789
thank you I'm happy to say that there

497
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,080
are many people of every different

498
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:03,700
background and said the same thing to me

499
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,580
white black Asian or you're like oh you

500
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,600
seem like a normal dude that's one

501
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,950
reason why I'm here having this

502
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,500
conversation with you all is that I

503
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:13,299
wanted to lean into the fact that I'm a

504
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,549
normal dude who decided to run for

505
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:18,220
president because I saw how [ __ ] up

506
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:20,799
[ __ ] is getting and it's not gonna

507
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:23,710
unfuck itself honestly I mean like it's

508
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,720
really broken very very badly broken I'm

509
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:29,769
now deep in the process I'm sixth in the

510
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:34,120
race to become the nominee and I see how

511
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:36,490
badly we need to win because I see the

512
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:39,279
machinery around me and it's not

513
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:42,220
designed to solve the problems it's

514
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:44,110
designed to make certain people money is

515
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,870
designed to keep certain things the same

516
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:49,600
so certain people can make money and the

517
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:52,360
people problems challenges of this era

518
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,399
are secondary the feedback mechanism in

519
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,500
our government is essentially broken and

520
00:19:54,399 --> 00:19:57,490
it's one reason why Donald Trump became

521
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,380
our president is that

522
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,419
tens of millions of Americans were so

523
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:03,309
fed up they were like let's take the bed

524
00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:04,750
on the nurses history Aldi TV star wants

525
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:06,640
to drain a swap it can't be worse than

526
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:09,039
what we're getting now and so that

527
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,529
that's the lesson that Democrats need to

528
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,809
really listen to this time around where

529
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:16,059
you can't say you know what our antidote

530
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:18,340
is gonna be business as usual because

531
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:20,950
many Americans don't think business as

532
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:22,360
usual was working and many Americans

533
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,770
made the same choice that you all have

534
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,630
made which is like I'm just not gonna

535
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:27,070
pay attention this [ __ ] because it's not

536
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:29,200
relevant to my life it's depressing

537
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:33,490
they're talking about stuff that in ways

538
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:35,590
that does not seem relevant to me so the

539
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:39,039
fact that it's a very rational choice to

540
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:41,919
ignore this stuff is a sign of the fact

541
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,360
that we need to change things so besides

542
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,809
the thousand dollars a month that you

543
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:49,510
you're proposing how do we have a lot of

544
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:52,000
younger viewers here and a lot of

545
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:54,159
first-time voters as well why should

546
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,460
these young volts vote for you like

547
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:59,409
besides $1,000 a month I'm really

548
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:06,760
passionate about this because how old

549
00:20:59,409 --> 00:21:07,960
are you all 29 29 32 33 I'm 44 and what

550
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,029
I'm passionate about is that we have

551
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,529
left a total mess to young people in

552
00:21:10,029 --> 00:21:13,090
particular and then the worst thing is

553
00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:17,830
we blame them for it they're like

554
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:19,600
somehow it's your fault we're I mean the

555
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:21,490
clearest examples are that we've gotten

556
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,039
rid of a lot of the secure livelihoods

557
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:25,360
and jobs moving forward ninety-four

558
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:26,529
percent of the new jobs that are getting

559
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,659
created in the United States are a

560
00:21:26,529 --> 00:21:30,130
temporary gig or contract work that

561
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:32,380
don't have benefits and have a very

562
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:35,370
precarious path forward Thank You bird

563
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:37,179
driver as an example our youtuber or

564
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:38,980
youtuber because I know you guys have to

565
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:40,600
scratch and claw I get it and then you

566
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,010
have to you know you put out a video and

567
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,299
then you have to be like oh how's it

568
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,950
gonna perform and then you know it's

569
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:48,909
like it's it's hard like everything's

570
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:51,220
hard so that's where the economy has

571
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:53,230
gone and then we made college two and a

572
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:55,630
half times more expensive where you look

573
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:57,549
at the price tags holy cow then someone

574
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:59,409
just told me today like you know some of

575
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:00,730
these schools like 60,000 a year so if

576
00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:02,289
you want to attend for four years it's

577
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:03,279
like quarter of a million dollars so if

578
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:05,289
you're a young person watching this

579
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:08,710
you're like what the f you know you're

580
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:10,810
looking up at that and and then you look

581
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:14,320
at climate change and say hey

582
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:15,850
turns out why there's gonna get worse

583
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,350
and it's gonna get hotter the sea levels

584
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:20,620
gonna rise they're gonna be storms and

585
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:22,210
floods and droughts and problems active

586
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,440
shooter drills in schools you go to

587
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,790
school me like what the heck's going on

588
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,860
like kids actually I to practice for

589
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:28,390
this stuff so if you're a young person

590
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:30,160
you look up and say why does it seem

591
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:32,650
like things are going so poorly and that

592
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,600
the world I'm inheriting is not really

593
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:36,100
set up for me to thrive and succeed and

594
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,290
be happy and prosperous and that even

595
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:40,390
have a secure livelihood by the numbers

596
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:42,130
and I'm a numbers person if you were

597
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:44,080
born in the 1940s the United States of

598
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:45,670
America you had a 93 percent chance of

599
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,560
doing better than your parents that's

600
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:50,110
the American dream like you know your

601
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:52,210
kids are gonna do better than you are if

602
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:54,760
you were born in the 1990s which I guess

603
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:58,540
is some of you right yeah you're down to

604
00:22:54,760 --> 00:23:00,340
a 50/50 chance and guess where the doubt

605
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:05,620
to thousands are going it's not going

606
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:07,120
back up so in 93 5050 and then for a

607
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,040
young person now you're looking at a

608
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,660
less than 50% chance of doing better

609
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,850
than your parents you know who's figured

610
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:14,560
this out your parents they're looking up

611
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,030
being like wow I'm not sure my kids

612
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,610
gonna have a better life you know what

613
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:20,920
else is figuring it out the kids kids

614
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:22,750
are like why does it seem like things

615
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,910
are not gonna go better for me so this

616
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:26,620
is the mess the shambles that young

617
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:28,210
people are inheriting and then young

618
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,980
people are being blamed for it because

619
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:33,220
we're saying it's like somehow your

620
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:34,570
fault because culture lazy smartphone

621
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:37,840
social me I don't know even what the

622
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:39,430
accusation is millennial being a

623
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,140
millennial right well if you want to pay

624
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:42,670
your dues whatever like the nonsense

625
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,200
narrative is to clarify when you see a

626
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,810
better life what exactly cuz you said

627
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,950
you did the math on it like what exactly

628
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:50,590
are the calculations like what are you

629
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:52,360
basing that off of just money or yeah so

630
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:54,280
so when I said the 93 percent of 50

631
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,170
percent a little better life right

632
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,520
that was straight socio-economic success

633
00:23:56,170 --> 00:24:00,040
are you gonna make more money than your

634
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,990
parents do okay yeah now is that the

635
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,640
end-all be-all obviously no I mean

636
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:06,670
there's there are a lot more important

637
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,320
things in life than your paycheck but if

638
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:09,610
you had to go society-wide and try and

639
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,410
figure out are things getting better or

640
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:14,410
worse for people that would be a good

641
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:16,660
place to start so so if you're a young

642
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:18,190
person you have these concerns and

643
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,510
misgivings about the world you're

644
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:21,130
inheriting the country are being left

645
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:23,410
you're not sure the country is really

646
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:24,220
working for you and it is not working

647
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:26,049
for you

648
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:29,409
it's right now not even designed to work

649
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:31,809
for you so the goal has to be to change

650
00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:34,659
that and I'm a parent now I've got six

651
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:35,679
and four year old boys and I want to be

652
00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:38,140
able to look them in the eyes and say

653
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,450
we're gonna leave you a country that we

654
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:43,630
can actually be proud of that is as good

655
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:45,880
as the country I came to and my parents

656
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:47,470
immigrated this country met as graduate

657
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:51,309
students at Berkeley here in California

658
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:53,440
they had me and my brother and it's been

659
00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:55,030
great you know in the sense that they

660
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,159
came here for better opportunities and

661
00:24:55,030 --> 00:25:00,700
my you know I just became an uncle

662
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:05,110
yesterday like my yeah I haven't met her

663
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:07,090
yet because I'm busy campaigning that

664
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:09,970
affected your like your actual personal

665
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:11,140
life like I'm sure I mean I'm not sure

666
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:13,120
actually with your wife and your kids

667
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:16,240
like is it's got to be tough and it's

668
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,500
gotta be there's gotta be some oh and

669
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,940
I'm just assuming things right now most

670
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,490
of us are fighting it's stressful or

671
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:23,860
like not there no it's very human man

672
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:25,270
it's the biggest downside of running for

673
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:28,809
president is I don't get to see my kids

674
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:30,490
as often I'm on the road a lot I would

675
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:31,870
miss my you know I have paced time my

676
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:34,510
wife this morning

677
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:37,270
she's been a superstar champ she's been

678
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:40,090
a rock if anyone's making a sacrifice in

679
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:41,890
this race it's her because my kids are a

680
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:45,760
lot of where all kids are a lot of work

681
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:47,919
like my kids are a lot of work and so I

682
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,620
want to be able to do that work with her

683
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:54,970
but I'm not able to right now so she's

684
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:59,669
taking it on the chin yeah it's it's a

685
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:59,669
definite change in your personal life

686
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:03,970
yeah that's the biggest downside of

687
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:05,080
running for sure was she all in when you

688
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:09,370
told her you're gonna do this or was she

689
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:10,840
like this is crazy oh well there's

690
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:14,200
definitely part of the crazy element it

691
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:16,510
was there but she thinks that I'm being

692
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,880
driven by a higher purpose she's

693
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:21,070
Christian and and believes that I'm

694
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:25,419
doing what I'm meant to do are you as

695
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:28,150
well I grew up in a secular household

696
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:30,850
but I've many family members who were

697
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:32,740
brought up Christian and obviously my

698
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:36,039
wife's Christian and we're raising our

699
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:37,499
boys a Christian so I go to church every

700
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:41,649
Sunday I'm home

701
00:26:37,499 --> 00:26:44,109
but I grew up secular okay I wanted to

702
00:26:41,649 --> 00:26:46,239
go back to the changes that you want it

703
00:26:44,109 --> 00:26:47,859
to make so let's say hypothetically

704
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:49,749
speaking you become president you have

705
00:26:47,859 --> 00:26:51,999
four years do you actually think you can

706
00:26:49,749 --> 00:26:54,190
make a meaningful impact knowing that a

707
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:55,779
lot of different sectors like the energy

708
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:57,039
sector Big Pharma they're owned by

709
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:59,679
lobbyists and you were just mentioning

710
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,179
that earlier I was just curious to see

711
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,989
like what is your strategy if you want

712
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:07,299
to make change yes so so thousand bucks

713
00:27:04,989 --> 00:27:09,039
I want to be a game changer for tens of

714
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:10,269
millions of Americans so then the next

715
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,099
step is how do we get the government

716
00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:13,809
working for us instead of the lobbyists

717
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:17,489
and right now the lobbyists have

718
00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:20,589
essentially taken captive our

719
00:27:17,489 --> 00:27:25,960
legislature legislators so the way we

720
00:27:20,589 --> 00:27:28,839
break that captivity is we give everyone

721
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,309
in America who's an adult again 100

722
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:32,200
democracy dollars a year that you can

723
00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:34,719
only give to candidates or campaigns or

724
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,820
causes that you like in value this would

725
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:39,580
wash out lobbyist money by a factor of

726
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:42,009
eight to one because you have to look up

727
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:43,599
and say what rules can I put in place

728
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:46,299
that'll keep the rich people and the

729
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:48,009
corporation's from getting a hold of the

730
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:49,960
legislators very very hard it's like

731
00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:52,570
life in Jurassic Park money finds a way

732
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,759
you know I mean like the corporate

733
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:57,669
lobbying money would just like still get

734
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:59,889
its way in there and so the new plan

735
00:27:57,669 --> 00:28:02,169
should be to wash out the corporate

736
00:27:59,889 --> 00:28:03,909
money with people-powered money I've

737
00:28:02,169 --> 00:28:06,460
been running for president now for a

738
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:08,139
while and I have to say I'm incredibly

739
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:09,580
fortunate where we've now raised

740
00:28:08,139 --> 00:28:12,820
millions of dollars in increments of

741
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:15,190
only like $25 each just people donating

742
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,989
you know 15 20 dollars to the campaign

743
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:18,700
but for the vast majority of people who

744
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:19,960
are running for office they have two

745
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:23,049
things they're the people and they have

746
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:25,119
the money and so over time they started

747
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:27,489
listening for the money because it's

748
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:29,759
easier to measure the food is better the

749
00:28:27,489 --> 00:28:31,659
people can give them jobs afterwards I

750
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:33,129
think this is where they end up falling

751
00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:35,019
so we have to do is we have to combine

752
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:36,159
these two things we have to make it so

753
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:38,259
the people the money are in the same

754
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,330
place and then if you're a legislator

755
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:42,129
and the lobbyist comes and says hey I've

756
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:44,979
got a $50,000 check for you you can be

757
00:28:42,129 --> 00:28:46,989
like I'm getting five million from my

758
00:28:44,979 --> 00:28:50,019
voters my constituents I'm not gonna go

759
00:28:46,989 --> 00:28:51,850
against them for your $50,000 but right

760
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:54,160
now asking

761
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:55,630
legislators to ignore all the money when

762
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:58,240
that's where the bread is buttered is

763
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:59,860
just not realistic so this democracy

764
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,010
dollar that you're talking about is this

765
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:04,480
essentially US dollar well you know the

766
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:06,070
great thing is democracy dollars it's

767
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,600
been rolled out in certain communities

768
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:09,370
here in the US it's been rolled out in

769
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,110
other countries so you can even imagine

770
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:13,600
it being something as simple as you get

771
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:15,280
a coupon code and the beginning of the

772
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,810
year and then any time you want to give

773
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,610
to a candidate or campaign just use your

774
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:21,490
coupon code and then they you know

775
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:22,930
reference the code against the federal

776
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:27,160
database and then they just get the

777
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:29,380
money also accepting cryptocurrencies

778
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:32,290
I was curious on what are your thoughts

779
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:33,670
on Bitcoin I've many friends in the

780
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:36,520
cryptocurrency community and I'm a

781
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:39,400
believer in the underlying technology in

782
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:41,320
particular the blockchain has a world of

783
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:46,360
potential it's like a lot of other

784
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:48,280
technologies where right now the hype

785
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:51,220
sort of got a little bit overblown and

786
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:54,220
ahead of itself and the rest of it but

787
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:56,470
then the underlying technology is very

788
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:58,510
powerful and so what happens in these

789
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:00,970
cycles it tends to be that the hype gets

790
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:02,350
in front of it and then the air comes

791
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:04,570
out of the bubble but then the reality

792
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:05,710
ends up catching up over time have you

793
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:08,470
thought about I mean this is just

794
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:11,560
hypothetical UVI could essentially be

795
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:16,480
universal Bitcoin income no instead of

796
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:18,070
the money being taxed essentially it

797
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,780
could be based on a hard asset like a

798
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:22,090
Bitcoin yeah

799
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:25,690
Toshi's is you know you can fraction out

800
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:27,250
Satoshi's 100 million units 100 million

801
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:30,340
units to people I love where your head

802
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:32,050
is oh because I learned a lot from my

803
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,670
friends in the cryptocurrency community

804
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:34,900
around some of these principles and when

805
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:36,250
you start to think it's one reason why

806
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,080
just about everyone in the

807
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:40,090
cryptocurrency community loves the idea

808
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:45,280
of universal basic income or the freedom

809
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:47,770
that you care about and you believe yeah

810
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:51,640
I mean Facebook they made so much money

811
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:53,080
make so much money and and so what I say

812
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,640
to people sometimes is like do remember

813
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:57,760
getting your data check in the mail it's

814
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:00,580
like no but someone's getting your data

815
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,930
check in the mail I mean these trillion

816
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,220
dollar tech companies are profiting to

817
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:04,360
the tune of billions of dollars off of

818
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,830
our data

819
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:08,559
the interesting thing is our data could

820
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:11,650
actually become more valuable if we were

821
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:13,780
participating in some way right now it

822
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:17,350
just gets kind of anonymized and sold

823
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:18,880
and resold without our knowledge and it

824
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:21,820
could become more valuable if we were

825
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,740
part of the part of the process do you

826
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,990
have any plans to implement that like

827
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:27,700
how would you go about that yes I do

828
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:29,770
so one of the policies on yank 20/20

829
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:32,410
comm is your data as a property right

830
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:34,000
and so the plan would be to say to

831
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:35,980
companies that are profiting from our

832
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,730
data that there are a few principles you

833
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,679
have to adhere to

834
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:39,820
number one is you have to tell us what

835
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:40,320
you're doing and how much money you're

836
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,730
making

837
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,830
number two is you have to let us express

838
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:48,429
preferences as to how much or how little

839
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:49,840
of our data that we want to be made

840
00:31:48,429 --> 00:31:53,500
available and number three you have to

841
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:55,059
let us turn it off if we want but part

842
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,640
of the number one is like tell us how

843
00:31:55,059 --> 00:31:59,919
much value there is is that they have to

844
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:02,169
share the value with us so I'm just

845
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,940
being I'm a normal dude so what did

846
00:32:02,169 --> 00:32:06,190
normal dudes do when they see that giant

847
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:09,250
like you know click and agree thing they

848
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:12,130
just ignore all right I mean like that's

849
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:13,630
what we all do and so we should be able

850
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,919
to keep doing that because I love

851
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:18,820
convenience as much as the next person

852
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:21,100
but if you're making money off me you

853
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:24,070
have to cut me in on the deal yeah and

854
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:25,780
so yeah and so that that's where what I

855
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:26,740
want us to be at is essentially at a

856
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,059
certain point you express your

857
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,559
preference you're being a look I love

858
00:32:28,059 --> 00:32:32,380
convenience just give me some of the

859
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:34,000
convenience back to my pocket and then

860
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:36,160
if I ever want to change my mind on that

861
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,620
I can do so right just for like I mean

862
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:40,240
like a ballpark cuz I have no idea what

863
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:42,669
kind of numbers are you thinking for a

864
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,730
person's you know I have no idea how

865
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:47,620
much that's worth so right now the art

866
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,929
data is worth a different amount

867
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:51,010
depending upon who you are if you travel

868
00:32:49,929 --> 00:32:52,419
a lot your data's worth a lot more

869
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:57,340
because then they just want to sell you

870
00:32:52,419 --> 00:32:59,860
like hotel chains and stuff and stuff if

871
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:02,679
you have some kind of health condition

872
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:05,200
your data is worth a lot more sometimes

873
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:07,980
people's health data is getting sold for

874
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,940
thousands of dollars per user per user

875
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:13,179
based on how much you consume

876
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:15,460
essentially whether it's there yeah

877
00:33:13,179 --> 00:33:17,350
there different factors that affect how

878
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,040
valuable your data is but it can get

879
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:20,080
into the

880
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,880
per user but you are saying you want to

881
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,770
take a piece of that and give it to the

882
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:27,070
person who's essentially given it yes

883
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:29,590
because it's so dope I mean why who else

884
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:31,030
should be getting the well most of us

885
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:33,010
didn't know it was even happening you

886
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:34,390
know I mean until that documentary came

887
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:36,490
out recently on Netflix telling us

888
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:39,070
basically it was good timing yeah

889
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:40,900
seriously okay

890
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:44,950
yeah we should go into the environment

891
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:49,150
so you mentioned that man you mentioned

892
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:50,260
we're 10 years but I mean like that's I

893
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:52,270
appreciate the honesty

894
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:54,280
we're 10 years late when it comes to

895
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:56,530
saving the environment what are some

896
00:33:54,280 --> 00:34:00,790
things that you want to do as you know

897
00:33:56,530 --> 00:34:01,120
as president to kind of slow this thing

898
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:04,300
down

899
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,220
yeah the climate change we have to do a

900
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:08,380
whole lot more I just at least a

901
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,700
five-point plan which includes some of

902
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,260
the stuff you probably hear from other

903
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:13,450
places which is try and move towards

904
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:16,149
renewables the big piece of the puzzles

905
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:19,120
that 85% of the world's emissions are

906
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:21,220
from non-us sources so if you want to

907
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:23,020
try and curb emissions in a serious way

908
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:25,030
then you have to go to Africa and say to

909
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,830
them you know that coal burning power

910
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:29,500
plant that China is installing for you

911
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:30,909
for free I'm going to try and convince

912
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:34,149
you that these solar panels and wind

913
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:36,190
turbines are a better option and so then

914
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:37,870
you have to subsidize that to a very

915
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:41,230
high degree if you're gonna make that

916
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:44,830
competitive the third thing is that we

917
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:46,149
should be trying to make our communities

918
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:47,649
more resilient and literally and

919
00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:49,570
figuratively move our people to higher

920
00:34:47,649 --> 00:34:51,580
ground where you know if there's a

921
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:53,740
hurricane who suffers poor people who

922
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:56,379
don't have great shelter or cars and get

923
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:57,910
into to drive away and anyone who thinks

924
00:34:56,379 --> 00:35:00,100
this stuff is a little doom and gloom

925
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:02,080
we were already moving climate refugees

926
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,970
in the United States we already took a

927
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:06,220
town of people in Louisiana where their

928
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:08,170
land had essentially become underwater

929
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,360
and uninhabitable and we said well it's

930
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:11,980
time to move you so if we're doing that

931
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,450
there then we should start looking at

932
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:15,790
other places where frankly that's

933
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:17,290
starting to happen and it's happening in

934
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:20,830
more and more places around the country

935
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:24,190
not just Louisiana the fourth thing is

936
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:26,050
that we have to try and undo some of the

937
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:29,010
damage we're doing so that involves

938
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:31,660
reforesting tracts of land it involves

939
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:34,299
trying to repair some of the oceans by

940
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:36,520
seeding plankton beds it sounds a little

941
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:38,200
far out but four to eight percent of

942
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,599
marine life in the Atlantic Ocean is

943
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,940
dying now every year so if you

944
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:45,069
extrapolate that over time you're

945
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:47,589
talking about massive massive problems

946
00:35:45,069 --> 00:35:49,720
and so we can't just try and do less of

947
00:35:47,589 --> 00:35:51,880
the bad we have to try and undo some of

948
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,829
the damage so those are some of the

949
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,650
plans I have on climate change I just

950
00:35:53,829 --> 00:35:58,960
released a 5 trillion dollar plan to try

951
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:00,520
and take those steps the these are

952
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:04,049
things that you've I'm assuming you've

953
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:06,160
worked with scientists or something but

954
00:36:04,049 --> 00:36:08,049
correct me if I'm wrong you said it's

955
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,390
already 10 years too late though right

956
00:36:08,049 --> 00:36:12,700
it's 10 years too late to keep the earth

957
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:15,430
from warming ok the earth is going to

958
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:16,690
warm it is already warming the last four

959
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:18,339
years have been the four warmest years

960
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:19,930
in recorded history which sounds like a

961
00:36:18,339 --> 00:36:21,069
remarkable coincidence I mean it's not a

962
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:24,039
coincidence it's because the earth is

963
00:36:21,069 --> 00:36:26,020
warming July was the warmest year in

964
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:27,940
recorded history so when I say it's ten

965
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:31,030
years too late it's ten years too late

966
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:33,160
to keep the earth from warming in a

967
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:36,430
significant and measurable way it's

968
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:38,470
never too late to start trying to repair

969
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:40,750
damage make our communities more

970
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:44,740
resilient make your economy more

971
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:46,029
sustainable there's a proverb the best

972
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:48,130
time to plant the tree is twenty years

973
00:36:46,029 --> 00:36:49,539
ago the second best time is now it's

974
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:51,309
like one low situation it's like should

975
00:36:49,539 --> 00:36:53,710
we have done it 10 years ago or 20 years

976
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:54,819
ago of course in the absence of having

977
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:57,250
done that do we need to take dramatic

978
00:36:54,819 --> 00:36:59,109
action now yes essentially you're also

979
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:01,210
providing more jobs like infrastructure

980
00:36:59,109 --> 00:37:02,829
jobs for people to build yeah I was just

981
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:04,900
with this gonna sound so politician II

982
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:07,630
but I was just with this entrepreneur

983
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:09,940
Ned Reynolds in New Hampshire and he now

984
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:12,099
has 260 solar installers working for him

985
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:14,529
who are just putting panels on people's

986
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:16,930
roofs and that's a really good job and

987
00:37:14,529 --> 00:37:19,089
we need it and it's gonna make us more

988
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:21,279
energy efficient and it's gonna lower

989
00:37:19,089 --> 00:37:23,289
people's heating bills so it's just a

990
00:37:21,279 --> 00:37:24,789
win-win-win those are the kinds of jobs

991
00:37:23,289 --> 00:37:28,779
we need to be creating in very large

992
00:37:24,789 --> 00:37:31,390
numbers Trump said that he brought back

993
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:33,760
many manufacturing jobs more than anyone

994
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:36,400
thought possible is that an accurate

995
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,990
statement it's an accurate statement

996
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,990
that there's been a slight bounce back

997
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:42,730
in manufacturing employment but big

998
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:44,980
picture we were at seventeen million

999
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:46,450
manufacturing jobs around

1000
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:49,450
thousand and then we went all the way

1001
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:51,280
down to 12 million or so so that's five

1002
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:54,190
million loss and now we're somewhere

1003
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:59,920
between 12 and 13 million so has there

1004
00:37:54,190 --> 00:38:01,180
been a bounce-back yes have Donald

1005
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,630
Trump's policies had something to do

1006
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:05,859
with it presumably yes is this partially

1007
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:09,580
Donald Trump just blowing his own smoke

1008
00:38:05,859 --> 00:38:12,790
like usual also yes why is it that

1009
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:15,280
whenever I I mean I watch everything not

1010
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:18,700
just like fox or CNN or either side

1011
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,350
whenever I see the pro Trump side it's

1012
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:23,920
always you know the economy's doing

1013
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:26,250
great much better under Trump and then I

1014
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,450
watch I just see Connor it's just all

1015
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,900
counter-arguments and it what's the

1016
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:32,890
truth

1017
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:34,270
like why are there numbers supposedly

1018
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:37,119
that support that under Trump

1019
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:40,090
everything's better the economy the

1020
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,740
major there there are a few economic

1021
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:43,840
moves that Donald Trump's made the two

1022
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:46,150
big ones were a tax cut and the second

1023
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:49,030
one was the trade war with China so the

1024
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:52,000
tax cut cut corporate taxes by 1.5

1025
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:54,310
trillion dollars which ended up boosting

1026
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,119
the economy in a particular way that is

1027
00:38:54,310 --> 00:39:00,730
true only 6% of that those gains went to

1028
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:02,200
workers the vast majority of it went to

1029
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:04,690
shareholders of corporations and

1030
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:07,119
buybacks and the rest of it so have you

1031
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:08,500
seen better economic numbers at the top

1032
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,990
line yes

1033
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:13,300
was that the right way to go 100% no

1034
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:16,119
that was a terrible way to go because

1035
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:17,980
that 1.5 trillion tax cut ended up just

1036
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:19,930
boosting deficit which you know we're

1037
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:22,570
gonna eventually have to do something

1038
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:26,050
about and then the trade war has been a

1039
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:27,730
huge net negative for the economy so if

1040
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:29,619
you were to go and say hey Donald

1041
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:31,390
Trump's been good for the economy it's

1042
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:33,940
narrowly true if you ignore the fact

1043
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:36,310
that he also increased our deficit by

1044
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:38,260
hundreds of billions of dollars and if

1045
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:39,820
you were going to for example spend the

1046
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:41,920
trillion and a half dollars I've got a

1047
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:43,930
great idea why not just give it to the

1048
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,820
American people in the form of a

1049
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:47,440
dividend and instead of having it all go

1050
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:49,600
to corporate buybacks it would go right

1051
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,000
back in the economy into our hands it

1052
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:54,100
would increase the actual health of our

1053
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,100
people because that's what happens when

1054
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:59,529
money is in our hands we end up becoming

1055
00:39:56,100 --> 00:40:01,539
healthier mentally healthier

1056
00:39:59,529 --> 00:40:04,420
better educated like all these good

1057
00:40:01,539 --> 00:40:06,759
things happen so to me it was a tragic

1058
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:08,769
misuse of resources that went directly

1059
00:40:06,759 --> 00:40:09,099
to the corporations that needed at the

1060
00:40:08,769 --> 00:40:11,460
least

1061
00:40:09,099 --> 00:40:13,630
okay so just selective reporting then

1062
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:14,769
yeah it's like if you were to want to

1063
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:19,539
tell a story it's like Trump's been

1064
00:40:14,769 --> 00:40:20,979
great for GDP it's like just like kind

1065
00:40:19,539 --> 00:40:23,019
of seen both sides because I don't want

1066
00:40:20,979 --> 00:40:24,789
to just pick one side and just go with

1067
00:40:23,019 --> 00:40:25,029
it because they're so conflicting you

1068
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:27,430
know

1069
00:40:25,029 --> 00:40:29,650
well you summarized a big problem today

1070
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:31,479
in America is that you have different

1071
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:32,799
news silos people getting news from

1072
00:40:31,479 --> 00:40:34,599
different sources no one can agree on

1073
00:40:32,799 --> 00:40:37,960
anything and some of these channels

1074
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:39,579
don't even pretend anymore like

1075
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,739
sometimes they get called out on bad

1076
00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:43,569
reporting and they're like we're an

1077
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:44,680
entertainment business we're not a news

1078
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:49,979
business and you're like are you

1079
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:53,380
[ __ ] me do you have any plans on

1080
00:40:49,979 --> 00:40:55,749
working with those news outlets and

1081
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:59,650
maybe I don't know figure out a way to

1082
00:40:55,749 --> 00:41:01,509
make you more accurate reporting fake

1083
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:04,450
news and things like that you know I

1084
00:41:01,509 --> 00:41:05,769
think that's that's gonna become a more

1085
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:08,109
serious problem when you have deep fakes

1086
00:41:05,769 --> 00:41:09,670
and technological things that you know

1087
00:41:08,109 --> 00:41:11,559
it's like then you really need someone

1088
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:16,619
to come in and be like yo that videos

1089
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:18,880
not who had a deep fake voice of his

1090
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:20,229
convinced the CFO to transfer two

1091
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,589
hundred and fifty thousand dollars into

1092
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:25,359
the deep fake voices account so there's

1093
00:41:23,589 --> 00:41:28,719
and this is just the beginning of deep

1094
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:30,519
fake sorry what is deep fake it's

1095
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:32,829
essentially when you do either a video

1096
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:35,079
or audio that sounds like or looks like

1097
00:41:32,829 --> 00:41:36,339
a person but I made it up but now the

1098
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:39,729
technology is so good that it's

1099
00:41:36,339 --> 00:41:41,170
indistinguishable right okay well yeah

1100
00:41:39,729 --> 00:41:43,719
and it's someone distinguishable that

1101
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:46,989
even if you know it's a fake you can't

1102
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:47,710
actually necessarily like say this is a

1103
00:41:46,989 --> 00:41:52,599
forgery

1104
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:54,249
I know it's so frightening I mean that

1105
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:55,180
could be like the end of society or

1106
00:41:54,249 --> 00:41:56,799
worse like you know we can't trust

1107
00:41:55,180 --> 00:42:00,219
anything we have to confirm each other

1108
00:41:56,799 --> 00:42:05,739
by memory only memory that we go back to

1109
00:42:00,219 --> 00:42:07,569
campfires what would you say are some

1110
00:42:05,739 --> 00:42:09,729
things that these young people should be

1111
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:12,300
studying in order to secure a job for

1112
00:42:09,729 --> 00:42:14,550
the for the future since AI is

1113
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:16,230
so here's the good news according to the

1114
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:22,140
projections so there's not good news but

1115
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:24,150
all presenta it's good news the

1116
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:27,150
proportion of jobs that are likely to be

1117
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:29,610
lost automation the range of estimates

1118
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:31,440
is between twenty and forty four percent

1119
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:33,450
which still means that a majority of

1120
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,530
jobs will continue to exist so it's not

1121
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:39,720
like you know end of work as we know it

1122
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:42,990
and the work that will still be

1123
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:46,470
available to us all falls into two main

1124
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:48,990
categories non repetitive manual work

1125
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:50,430
and non repetitive cognitive work so

1126
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:53,130
I'll start with non repetitive cognitive

1127
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:59,100
this is like team-building interpersonal

1128
00:42:53,130 --> 00:43:02,040
creative stuff like you do design some

1129
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:03,810
of the STEM fields so that stuff is

1130
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:06,030
going to be with us for a long long time

1131
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:08,250
sales like you always gonna need sales

1132
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:11,490
these sorts of things non repetitive

1133
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:13,590
manual are things like plumbing and HVAC

1134
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:15,420
repair and a lot like can you imagine

1135
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:19,500
would take to make a robot plumber be

1136
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:21,810
next to impossible yeah it's too

1137
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:23,130
expensive so that there so so there are

1138
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:25,920
going to be jobs that are with us for a

1139
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:27,330
long time on the high end you want and

1140
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,280
what I say to young people and this is

1141
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:32,010
gonna sound like that like [ __ ]

1142
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,090
movie advice you got that there's a peer

1143
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:34,320
in me like I don't believe that advice

1144
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:36,300
but it's going to become better advice

1145
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,680
over time it's really important to find

1146
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:40,140
something that you enjoy and like

1147
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,850
because if you enjoy it then you're more

1148
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:45,480
likely to invest time in it and become

1149
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:48,120
good at it and develop like skills that

1150
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,290
are resilient over time so believe it or

1151
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,490
not if you're a young person you can

1152
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:53,610
find something you really enjoy doing

1153
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:55,140
you should lean into that and a lot of

1154
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:56,480
that revolves around interpersonal

1155
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:59,310
dynamics and skills because

1156
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:03,390
team-building is going to become crucial

1157
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:05,670
over time in a world where you know

1158
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:08,400
dealing with people is going to become a

1159
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:10,050
massive value add so that that's one

1160
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,060
thing I'd say is and it sounds like 80s

1161
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:13,260
movie that is advice or something but if

1162
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:15,860
you can find something you'd like doing

1163
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:18,600
just really trying it good at it

1164
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:23,510
can we go into foreign foreign policy

1165
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:23,510
sure so I get my presidential

1166
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:28,910
how do you have plans to continue

1167
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:31,730
president Trump's like confrontational

1168
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:32,690
approach to China economically and

1169
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:35,330
geopolitically

1170
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:38,480
well I think one of the traps that the

1171
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:40,070
US tends to get itself into is seeing

1172
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,450
the world as a zero-sum game where if

1173
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:44,450
someone else is doing better than it's

1174
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:46,310
somehow like hurting us and I think that

1175
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:50,359
is going to drag us into a cold war with

1176
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:52,490
China or worse and to me we have to see

1177
00:44:50,359 --> 00:44:55,000
that other countries can become more

1178
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:56,390
successful and it's not necessarily a

1179
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,240
bad thing

1180
00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:02,570
for the US are there things in the

1181
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:04,490
us-china relationship that are serious

1182
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:06,410
issues that we need to try and address

1183
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:10,160
like their piracy of intellectual

1184
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:11,090
property and increasingly some of the

1185
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,630
things they're going to happen in terms

1186
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:16,190
of human rights and and there's the

1187
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:17,950
protesters and and other things like

1188
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:21,940
yeah they are very very serious issues

1189
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:24,260
but is China's success necessarily

1190
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:28,160
destructive to the US like I I don't

1191
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:30,140
believe so so we have to take that

1192
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,570
stance where we protect America's

1193
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:34,670
national interest but do it in a

1194
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:36,470
disciplined way where we also don't

1195
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:37,070
confuse economic success in national

1196
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:38,210
security

1197
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:40,010
if something's national security then

1198
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:43,339
you have to go hard and that that's just

1199
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:46,880
the stance but the economic interests

1200
00:45:43,339 --> 00:45:48,410
sometimes get confused with security

1201
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,570
interests in a way that I think is not

1202
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:55,460
very productive what about North Korea

1203
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:57,230
Middle East well I think engaging with

1204
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,609
North Korea is not a bad thing I think

1205
00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:00,440
engaging with foreign leaders that we

1206
00:45:58,609 --> 00:46:02,900
disagree with is generally productive

1207
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:04,250
and so I wouldn't you know I wouldn't

1208
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,570
say that

1209
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:07,400
you know Donald Trump did something

1210
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:10,070
wrong where he went wrong with North

1211
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:12,290
Korea is that he kept meeting with Kim

1212
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:13,970
jong-un without clear parameters in

1213
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:15,740
terms of what he needed to get out of

1214
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:17,869
the meeting either before during and

1215
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:19,880
eaze had this all-or-nothing approach to

1216
00:46:17,869 --> 00:46:21,250
the diplomacy and denuclearization where

1217
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:24,380
there are goals you can set that are

1218
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:25,730
short of complete denuclearization that

1219
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:27,470
would be very very good for the u.s.

1220
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:29,990
that if you're gonna meet with with them

1221
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:31,640
and that needs to happen and this is

1222
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:33,380
personal for me my sister-in-law's in

1223
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:36,410
Seoul right now so anything that happens

1224
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:37,700
in the and the Korean Peninsula

1225
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:42,319
you know it actually affects family

1226
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:44,660
members if you had to choose what

1227
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:45,979
country outside of the USA would you say

1228
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:50,450
is doing a pretty good job of running

1229
00:46:45,979 --> 00:46:51,710
their country I think that Denmark in

1230
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:55,450
the Scandinavian countries have done a

1231
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:57,859
really good job of helping build robust

1232
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:59,839
social safety nets and structures that

1233
00:46:57,859 --> 00:47:01,549
have helped people manage very very

1234
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:03,470
difficult transitions I think we can

1235
00:47:01,549 --> 00:47:04,970
learn a lot from them but do you think

1236
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:07,039
they're able to do that because it's a

1237
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:08,779
smaller country compared to the US and

1238
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:11,180
the u.s. being like a melting pot of so

1239
00:47:08,779 --> 00:47:13,789
many different cultures yeah they have

1240
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:15,710
some advantages in terms of their

1241
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:16,910
ability to get some of these things done

1242
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:19,999
and to me one of the great challenges

1243
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:21,789
for the United States is to be able to

1244
00:47:19,999 --> 00:47:24,380
get great things done despite being

1245
00:47:21,789 --> 00:47:25,549
heterogeneous you know like it shouldn't

1246
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:26,869
be that we all have to look exactly the

1247
00:47:25,549 --> 00:47:30,170
same to get big things done you know I

1248
00:47:26,869 --> 00:47:31,249
mean okay well I mean we were just

1249
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:33,499
instructed you have like five more

1250
00:47:31,249 --> 00:47:35,299
minutes so before you go I have to ask

1251
00:47:33,499 --> 00:47:37,190
you something or ten minutes before you

1252
00:47:35,299 --> 00:47:41,029
go there's something I want to ask you

1253
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:43,160
and see this in five minutes so what are

1254
00:47:41,029 --> 00:47:44,749
your thoughts about aliens and you know

1255
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,729
Bernie Sanders came out on Joe Rogan's

1256
00:47:44,749 --> 00:47:48,410
podcast which he also did and said

1257
00:47:46,729 --> 00:47:50,180
basically if he becomes president he is

1258
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:51,859
going to what do you say he's gonna like

1259
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:54,079
release the information about aliens and

1260
00:47:51,859 --> 00:47:56,390
the truth and stuff like that they do

1261
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:57,859
but that's what I'm saying like truth

1262
00:47:56,390 --> 00:48:02,359
they get told the truth and we're like

1263
00:47:57,859 --> 00:48:05,299
it's too scary to share I am on the same

1264
00:48:02,359 --> 00:48:07,089
page I will share what's going on with

1265
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:11,509
the aliens of the American people unless

1266
00:48:07,089 --> 00:48:13,549
it's just too damn scary don't you think

1267
00:48:11,509 --> 00:48:14,479
that's already happened then like I mean

1268
00:48:13,549 --> 00:48:16,969
I've seen interviews it's like

1269
00:48:14,479 --> 00:48:18,739
conspiracy theorists say like you know

1270
00:48:16,969 --> 00:48:20,660
Barack Obama went on certain interviews

1271
00:48:18,739 --> 00:48:21,950
and he kind of hinted at it but he

1272
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:23,809
doesn't want to say it he said he was

1273
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:27,499
gonna release that stuff too right so

1274
00:48:23,809 --> 00:48:29,900
let's just say my threshold for not

1275
00:48:27,499 --> 00:48:35,119
sharing would be astronomically high

1276
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:36,979
like I would share it unless it was like

1277
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:40,339
we grew up watching every alien movie

1278
00:48:36,979 --> 00:48:43,969
that's where I am you know I think

1279
00:48:40,339 --> 00:48:45,259
watching x-files yeah so let's just say

1280
00:48:43,969 --> 00:48:46,519
that I would like to be able to be

1281
00:48:45,259 --> 00:48:49,219
transparent about these things the

1282
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:50,150
American okay pretty much I'm a regular

1283
00:48:49,219 --> 00:48:52,819
dude what would a regular

1284
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:54,380
the situation but like it always seems

1285
00:48:52,819 --> 00:48:56,720
like that it always seems like a regular

1286
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:58,819
dude until they become important right

1287
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:00,260
they become the president or somebody

1288
00:48:58,819 --> 00:49:02,589
and then and then somebody gets to them

1289
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:05,359
gets to them what them yeah I mean yeah

1290
00:49:02,589 --> 00:49:09,170
one of my primary qualification is to be

1291
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:14,510
president is that I think I'm fairly

1292
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:16,789
unchanged through this process become

1293
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:21,049
president to like there's so many

1294
00:49:16,789 --> 00:49:22,880
trappings of the office that I could

1295
00:49:21,049 --> 00:49:24,289
take or leave you know I just want to

1296
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,520
solve the problems I'm on the record

1297
00:49:24,289 --> 00:49:26,630
saying like if I could saw the problems

1298
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:29,000
not being president I would take that to

1299
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:32,150
like I don't have any native intrinsic

1300
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,670
burning desire to be press which means

1301
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:36,200
you would help another candidate if you

1302
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:38,000
weren't the nominee you'd help another

1303
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,680
candidate oh yeah I had one of my major

1304
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,069
life's goals it was to like to elevate a

1305
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:44,809
major national candidate and my wife saw

1306
00:49:43,069 --> 00:49:50,029
these goals and you know was not on the

1307
00:49:44,809 --> 00:49:54,410
list be a major you know maybe that's

1308
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:57,410
partially an Asian thing too you know

1309
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:59,240
what I mean that's a health or just like

1310
00:49:57,410 --> 00:50:00,859
you want to get the stuff done and like

1311
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:02,869
being front and center is not you don't

1312
00:50:00,859 --> 00:50:05,000
need to be the guy you just want to get

1313
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:07,220
the solutions yeah that's right in the

1314
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,130
group project okay America needs

1315
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:11,900
solutions and a smart president oh thank

1316
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:15,920
you for saying so I think so too

1317
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:17,660
like a bull version okay well before we

1318
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,599
get going where can people go to support

1319
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:23,809
you if you'd like to join the yangyang

1320
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:25,400
just go to yang 2020 comm give a buck

1321
00:50:23,809 --> 00:50:28,130
five bucks it makes a huge difference

1322
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:31,220
because the media keeps track of number

1323
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:33,650
of donors as a measurement of support so

1324
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:36,440
yang 2020 calm you'll see all of my

1325
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:39,020
policies and plans there we also have a

1326
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:41,900

as fun as yours but you know we've we

1328
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:45,260
have like videos and a lot of people are

1329
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,450
making art about me and the campaign

1330
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:49,819
which is a lot of fun and awesome and

1331
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:52,779
some of it MC Jin did yang Yang Anthem I

1332
00:50:49,819 --> 00:50:56,809

you and I will say the people watching

1340
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:12,380
