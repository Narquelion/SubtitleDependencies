1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
hey guys so just to let you guys know

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,830
this video is gonna be a little weird

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,569
and it's gonna feel kind of rushed and

4
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,649
yeah I don't have a lot of time to

5
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:09,269
explain it so I'm just gonna get

6
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:10,590
straight to the point sean is moving

7
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:11,639
away normally this would be the part

8
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,620
where I would cut to like some kind of

9
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,299
sad skit or do some kind of joke or

10
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,039
something like that but like I said we

11
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:18,900
have no time he's moving away in two

12
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,220
days so just for some backstory sounds

13
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,869
not fighting with anybody in the group

14
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,250
or anything he's literally just moving

15
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:24,630
to California to be with his girlfriend

16
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,250
and I don't know if you guys know her

17
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,500
now but sean has an engineering degree

18
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,760
and that's one of his other passions and

19
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,470
he's gonna pursue that but we never

20
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,570
really knew when exactly we didn't have

21
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,160
like an exact day so we thought that

22
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,450
when you told us you know when he's

23
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,910
gonna be moving out we could have enough

24
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,739
time to plan this surprise you know

25
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,750
party or surprise performance for him

26
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:44,700
kinda gives us two days to come you know

27
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,190
come up with an idea and then pull it

28
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,420
all off he's gonna be tough I'm like I

29
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,190
was saying it's feeling kind of rushed

30
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,870
right now so I can't spend much more

31
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,010
time here the guys actually just came

32
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,750
over so we can start planning that

33
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,430
secretly planning this video because

34
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,840
Sean still packing so we it kind of

35
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,460
gives us two days to come up with an

36
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,559
idea and then pull it all off

37
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,710
it's gonna be tough Sean this video is

38
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:07,350
for you we got to just get to it right

39
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,330
now we're doing the planning stages for

40
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,490
Sean's we don't know what it is gonna be

41
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,869
just to reiterate I just got back from

42
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,299
Hawaii right now as I was getting back

43
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:18,180
just texted me and said he's actually

44
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:21,630
gonna be moving this week versus at the

45
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,100
end of the month we did Northern

46
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,250
California I won't say where it

47
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,680
specifically Sacramento so we can get

48
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:33,960
started let's figure out just make a

49
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:36,299
list of what Sean likes first thing that

50
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,460
comes to mind when I say shop fujiyoshi

51
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,579

52
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,880
okay okay famous bowls do the cookies

53
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,880
and cream

54
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:49,520
I know get back to the house Sean he

55
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:50,869
likes putting stuff together yes Sean he

56
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,859

58
00:01:54,859 --> 00:02:11,209
like swinging it's a necklace thing that

59
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:13,819
you got oh wait what one thing that you

60
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:16,579
really like some Crocs

61
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:18,530
when as Sean ever wore prop that's why

62
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:25,000
but hey you know I mean I don't I don't

63
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:25,000
know just do that on your own time enemy

64
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:37,280
you know the best just like Hawaiian

65
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:39,950
music yeah yeah reggae you should make

66
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,290
him a ho lion song okay papi how you

67
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:44,180
decided to it okay like a music yeah

68
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:46,910
might be about this yeah that's possible

69
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,859
we might be able to edit it together

70
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:51,470
dude we got two days it's easier than

71
00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:53,980
doing a live all dressed up like we're

72
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:58,730
gonna be Hawaiian singers and rappers I

73
00:02:53,980 --> 00:03:01,970
think he would laugh I think we should I

74
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:04,700
think everybody should know it's like a

75
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,810
it's a message to Sean I mean it must be

76
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,459
hard we'll just be like background

77
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,049
sounds and like ad-libs and stuff yeah

78
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:11,169
how we're gonna get him here without him

79
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:13,280
knowing you has to know something's up

80
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:15,950
leaving that day do you have like a

81
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,870
super old screen I have a bunch well I

82
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,880

00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:21,410
like what the hell and then he's like

84
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,690

90
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:46,690
the whole surprise me video and all that

91
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:46,690
stuff yeah okay operation on three three

92
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,720
I'm looking for beats on like royalty

93
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,160
free music

94
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,870
we're not musicians I just typed in

95
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,500
Hawaiian and reggae Sean's favorite

96
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:01,760
music

97
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,750
I honestly it could we could use any of

98
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,430
these but I think it should be something

99
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,230
more happy my type in Hawaiian anything

100
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:09,260
comes up there's like so stereotypical

101
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:10,540
like listening I can't sing to this or

102
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,610
it is like on SpongeBob

103
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:17,419
not like Hawaiian cops that brought us

104
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:20,000
what you gonna do bro whoa whoa doing

105
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:20,989
Maria na na hai in the studio right now

106
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,789
and as you can see

107
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:25,520
check out my studio you got the little

108
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:28,010
laptop setup right here got the mic and

109
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,310
then mount proof right here some sound

110
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:32,240
proofing machine the sound proofing

111
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,950
honestly don't know how to use most of

112
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,470
this stuff I just know how to plug it in

113
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,910
and then hit record so usually I make

114
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,350
all the songs with myself I do all the

115
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,820
voices and they kind of just like lips

116
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,860
but since this is a special thing for

117
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,419
Sean we're going to do is have

118
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,910
everybody's voice on it I'll probably do

119
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:47,870
most of it but like I definitely want to

120
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:50,360
have everyone in it

121
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:52,729
so hope you guys are ready I am singing

125
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:05,300
moving away movies in me meets this

126
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,250
culture of operation it is it really is

127
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,590
or is it appreciation culture

128
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:11,210
appreciation over from Hawaii yeah I

129
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,470

culture I grew up please culture

131
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:17,720

over the past two old days the rest of

171
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:38,880
us here at our HPC have been observing

00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:43,019
studies compiling data on a favorite

173
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:47,399
things from hobbies to show to smooth

00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:53,160
all in order to create the ultimate most

175
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:55,800
epic most amazing celebration we've gone

176
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,199
through countless gift ideas from all

177
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:01,139
new fishing equipment to a trip to

178
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:05,370
Disneyland to just straight-up giving

you a suitcase full of cash but nothing

180
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:10,620
seemed right until it finally hit us why

182
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:16,949

and give your final salutations what's

201
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,240
up Shawn so I am pretty bummed that

202
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:58,889
you're moving but I'm excited to see

203
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,569
what's in store for your future one

204
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:02,850
thing that I'm gonna miss about you is

205
00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:04,319
your ability to solve puzzles and

206
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,819
problems and stuff like that and I

207
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:08,040
remember specifically you actually

208
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:09,540
enjoyed the process of solving the

209
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,300
puzzle so what we decided to gift for

210
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,649
you was a Rubik's Cube buzz but we know

211
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,000
it's really easy for you to solve this

212
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,589
this is not an ordinary rubik's cube

213
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,149
plus all we did was we colored when the

214
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:20,069
yellow squares white so you'll

215
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:22,649
technically never be able to complete it

216
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:23,790
you'll just have the fun of trying to

217
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:25,500
solve it for the rest of your life and

218
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,209
if you get bored of this one we got you

219
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,470
this super easy one that you'll be able

220
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:33,509
to figure it out now good luck have fun

221
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,949
Shawn what's up bro you're leaving it's

222
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:37,559
gonna be different not having you around

223
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:39,899
you're like basically my right-hand man

224
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:41,819
when it comes to filming editing you

225
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:43,920
know getting stuff done with with Ryan

226
00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:45,329
and the videos and all that so it's

227
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,189
gonna be a little different me and you

228
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:49,199
were always kind of like you know

229
00:12:47,189 --> 00:12:50,850
sidekicks I guess we would even dress

230
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:52,740
the same sometimes don't shoot you know

231
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:54,420
we would like resting clothes they like

232
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,939
the same church for some reason we're

233
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,160
always wearing hats for some reason

234
00:12:55,939 --> 00:13:02,250
backwards hats especially so we decided

235
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:04,980
to get you a hat actually make you a hat

236
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:07,079
because it's not just ordinary hat as

237
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:11,040
you can see it's backwards but it's

238
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:13,019
always backwards yeah buddy

239
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,550
anyway I'm gonna miss you bro I'm gonna

240
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:16,290
miss having my right-hand man

241
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:18,180
but you know I'm sure we'll keep in

242
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:21,779
touch and we have one out there bro I'm

243
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:24,000
gonna miss you peace hey shine I just

244
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:25,800
wanted to say thank you so much for

245
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,140
being literally the first friend I made

246
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,570
and an excellent roommate for when I

247
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,579
first moved to Las Vegas anyway as you

248
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:38,100
know and as you all know you're the

249
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:41,519
sweatiest member of rhpc but I've never

250
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:43,470
seen this much before and I know you and

251
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,959
Ryan talk about this all the time on how

252
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:48,450
wish there was some sort of shirt that

253
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:50,220
me armpits were lighter than everything

254
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,480
else so that when you get sweaty it'll

255
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:55,410
all be the same color

256
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:57,660
well now you have one so enjoy we're

257
00:13:55,410 --> 00:14:02,579

261
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:08,700
always looked out for me and I

262
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,529
appreciated that you know we're excited

263
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,230
for you and we're trying to think as a

264
00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:14,820
group you know what does someone need

265
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:16,440
when they're moving furniture I know you

266
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,940
love building stuff I know you have an

267
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,440
engineering background so since you're

268
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,940
one of my close friends I decided to

269
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,230
break all of it for you that way you

270
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,060
could have fun putting it back together

271
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,770
there might be some missing screws maybe

272
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,450
some splinters and pointed edges sound

273
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:28,800
like a ghetto IKEA but I think you'll

274
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:31,380
have fun and that's what matters

275
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,510

you're able to make this move I mean it

282
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:48,690
takes a lot to be able to move past a

283
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,339
comfortable stage and move on to another

284
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:52,380
part of your life and I notice you know

building all right peace dude like this

302
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,590
dire urge to start this video by saying

303
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:36,770
hey guys but that's not the point

304
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:39,920
what up John I'm just gonna start this

305
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:41,750
off by saying that I feel very weird

306
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,120
obviously I feel sad that you're leaving

307
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:45,530
but the same time I'm really happy for

308
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,850
you but it is weird I'm not gonna lie

309
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:48,020
it's weird that you're not here right

310
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,190
now like at this shoot that we're

311
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,810
shooting today you know how it is when

312
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,340
we're missing someone from shoots it

313
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,780
feels weird but I guess we'll just have

314
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:56,890
to get used to that but anyway I'm just

315
00:15:53,780 --> 00:16:00,080
gonna start us off by saying that I am

316
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:02,360
very thankful for everything that you've

317
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,440
done you know not just for rhpc not just

318
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,030
like filming and stuff like that

319
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,860
obviously I'm thankful for that stuff

320
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,720
but just as for me personally as a

321
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,370
friend I'm extremely thankful we've

322
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,200
known each other since I was five and

323
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:14,300
you were four I think it's rare to have

324
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,220
friends that last this long I think in

325
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,900
our late 20s both of us damn world but

326
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,850
it's pretty rare that we're still able

327
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,680
to maintain this friendship and for me

328
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,880
personally growing up especially like

329
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,920
her on middle school high school time

330
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,300
your friendship meant so much to we're

331
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,010
making YouTube videos we're making those

332
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,690
lip sync videos we were dressing up as

333
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:31,910
girls and you know publicly putting this

334
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:34,190
stuff out there YouTube back then was

335
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,900
not what it is now this is like oh 506

336
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:37,550
when you know we were the weird kids

337
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,710
people didn't look at they looked at us

338
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:41,210
weird this wasn't a normal thing and you

339
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:43,190
were right there with me and I really

340
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:44,960
appreciate that I had somebody by my

341
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:47,000
side obviously we had Tim and our other

342
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,130
friends as well but we were a small

343
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,530
tight-knit group and you're always there

344
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:53,270
by my side sharing the weird burden but

345
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:55,250
anyway I'm not trying to make this all

346
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:57,470
overly dramatic or emotion or anything

347
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:59,270
so I'm just gonna go on to your final

348
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:01,100
gift as you can see it's right here are

349
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:02,630
the things I feel like we've always had

350
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,329
in common is that we've always watched

351
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:08,870
anime final gift is themed anime without

352
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:10,870
further ado a beautiful piece of artwork

353
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:14,339
that I person

354
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:19,180
the art on the bring a little closer see

355
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:20,530
whole CSU as you can see your finally if

356
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,309
is something I worked really hard on I

357
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,959
don't know if you're right

358
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:24,760
you recognize this or not but this is

359
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,949
when we did the anime shoot so that's

360
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,630
why I was talking about anime and how

361
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:29,950
you know personally I think this

362
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,540
something you can hang up on your wall

363
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:33,190
and when you move any fine you already

364
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,780
