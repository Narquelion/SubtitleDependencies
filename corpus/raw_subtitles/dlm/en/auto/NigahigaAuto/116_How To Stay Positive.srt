1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,449
hey guys so I like to think of myself as

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:04,830
a pretty positive thinker but at the

3
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:06,450
same time a lot of the closest people

4
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,799
around me seem to think the opposite I

5
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,750
always have to hear things like why are

6
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,280
you so pessimistic don't be so negative

7
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,990
all the time why can't you see the glass

8
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,429
half full instead of half empty for once

9
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,750
by the way that saying is not always

10
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:17,130
true because it depends on what the

11
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,480
glass is filled with if the glass is

12
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,830
half full with spoiled milk it's

13
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,720
probably more positive to see it half

14
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,369
empty just saying but moving on I'm not

15
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,689
gonna live in times the things I say can

16
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,160
be a little negative for example

17
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:27,539
whenever I took final exams in high

18
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,890
school I would always assume that I got

19
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:30,510
the lowest grade possible just so I

20
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,099
could mentally prepare myself in case I

21
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,600
fail or when I was wrestling for a state

22
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:35,489
championship I told myself before the

23
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,570
match means second place is still good

24
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:38,309
or especially when it came to girls

25
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,809
whenever I will try to prepare myself to

26
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:41,460
ask what a girl I would think of every

27
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:42,750
single way that I would be rejected so I

28
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,850
would know how to react in that scenario

29
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,320
which consequently made me not know what

30
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,090
to do when they said yes and that made

31
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,890
it super awkward but anyway whenever I

32
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,329
voiced these opinions to my friends or

33
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,980
family they would always criticize me

34
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,480
for being negative and I'm sure you guys

35
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,399
can relate to this we all know that one

36
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,809
friend or a family member that's mr. and

37
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,460
mrs. positive and gets on everybody's

38
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:00,780
case whenever you say the slightest bit

39
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,160
thing that's a little bit negative but

40
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,719
what people don't know about me even my

41
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,280
closest friends and family is that I'm

42
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,680
actually a really really positive

43
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,659
thinker like all really positive just in

44
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,520
my own head in my head I see the glass

45
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:12,840
half-full even when it's empty I pretty

46
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,580
much taught myself how to see the good

47
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,080
in every scenario no matter how bad it

48
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,400
might look I just don't say these things

49
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,470
out loud because when bad things happen

50
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,119
to people and you're overly positive a

51
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,740
lot of times it comes off as insensitive

52
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,030
or rude thinking like this actually

53
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,220
helped me through a lot of tough times

54
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,869
and rough situation but again I'm just

55
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,159
giving you guys these examples so that

56
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:31,020
you can see how I try to stay positive

57
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,579
in my own head I would never say these

58
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,140
things out loud and you shouldn't either

59
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:35,700
trust me you do not want to say these

60
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,409
things out loud my thought process is

61
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,850
that no matter how bad things get even

62
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:40,259
in the worst case scenario wherever

63
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,630
there's a negative there has to be a

64
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:46,270
positive you just have to find it

65
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:48,220
hey what's wrong man I just found out my

66
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:50,530
girlfriend's been cheating on me what

67
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,700
I'm so sorry that's terrible and that's

68
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,320
probably what I would say in that

69
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,640
scenario but that's not quite what I

70
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,530
would be thinking like I said I'm an

71
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,790
overly positive person in my head and

72
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,409
this is what it would look like if I

73
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,190
said what I was really thinking hey

74
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:01,659
what's wrong man

75
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:04,000
I just found out my girlfriend's been

76
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:05,619
cheating on me that's a wonderful bro

77
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,319
you don't have to waste any more time

78
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:10,869
wondering if she's the one hey what's up

79
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,760
man my grandfather just passed away such

80
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:16,060
a great guy so unfair

81
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:18,010
so sorry bro that's so sad again that

82
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,480
something I would say but my mind is

83
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,459
messed up and I would search for the

84
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,590
positive even in that it would something

85
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:26,470
my grandfather just passed away such a

86
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:28,120
great guy so fair sorry to hear that man

87
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,800
but I guess everyone has to die sometime

88
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,420
right I mean if everyone lived forever

89
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,800
we'd all be dead due to the exponential

90
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,390
growth of the human population we

91
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,430
wouldn't have enough resources so in a

92
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:42,549
way it's not the worst thing in the

93
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:43,690
world what happen somebody stole all her

94
00:02:42,549 --> 00:02:45,790
clothes from the laundromat like

95
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:47,650
literally a hundred dollars worth that

96
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,720
sucks I mean like who would even do that

97
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,670
you know the drill what happened

98
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,060
somebody stole all her clothes from the

99
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,590
laundry

100
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,320
like literally a hundred dollars worth

101
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,610
hey good for you that's a compliment

102
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,280
that means you have really good taste in

103
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,900
fashion see technically these are all

104
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,250
positive things but now you probably

105
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,450
know why I'm telling you to keep this in

106
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,040
your own head having these overly

107
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,269
positive thoughts didn't necessarily fix

108
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,470
any of the scenarios but they definitely

109
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:09,549
helped you to get through them and I

110
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,109
know sometimes it's hard to think

111
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:12,519
positive when you're sad or upset but

112
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:14,079
when you do have those moments you tend

113
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:17,200
that I'm they're giving you positive

114
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:20,320
thoughts oh my god

115
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,400
I'm only 16 what are they gonna do now

116
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,620
you don't have to worry about getting

117
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,100
pregnant for another nine months I could

118
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,329
never fall asleep I hate having insomnia

119
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,549
it's better than not being able to wake

120
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:33,280
up and being in a coma damn it they

121
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:35,260
forget my chalupas every single time wow

122
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,120
that is really courteous of them to be

123
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:40,310
helping you with your diet like that Oh

124
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,900
there's a dog poop all the places I

125
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,190
could have stepped hey man it could have

126
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,720
been worse at least I was in human poop

127
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:49,280
or like the dog itself or like HIV

128
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,510
contaminating or Lego damn my stomach

129
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,250
hurts so bad

130
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,390
maybe if I fart just a little bit you

131
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,629
won't smell it and I'll feel better Oh

132
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,930
[Music]

133
00:03:55,629 --> 00:03:58,400
God

00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,700

gone forever at least it wasn't your dog

138
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,629
you can't believe my dog is gone forever

139
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:13,849
at least it wasn't your cat you can't

140
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:15,470
believe I lost my cat and dog on the

141
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:17,269
same day well at least you can still

142
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,900
watch cat dog online to make yourself

143
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:20,389
feel better

144
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:23,660
what's cat dog you don't know what cat

145
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:25,400
dog is and I feel so old now if yours

146
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,600
I'm gonna get that reference or you

147
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,850
could just get rid of this scene and not

148
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,410
put it in the video ah but I can't take

149
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,090
the scene out now the video is already

150
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,530
online so you can take it out we're

151
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:36,020
still filming it and it's not even

152
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:38,060
edited yet man the scene is so confusing

153
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:42,800
I should just take it out or maybe some

154
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:44,450
people will get it my cat and dog were

155
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,310
still gone well at least this scene made

156
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,050
the video don't ask I don't even know

157
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:50,210
anyway you see no matter how bad things

158
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,710
get or how bad things may seem there's

159
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:53,360
always a positive in everything because

160
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,070
our world runs on balance and there

161
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,599
can't be a negative without a positive

162
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,400
life may give you a glass that looks

163
00:04:56,599 --> 00:05:00,289
half empty at times but it's you and

164
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,880
only you that has the power of choice to

165
00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:03,169
make that glass half full and if you can

166
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,030
do that there's nothing in this universe

167
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:12,110
that can ever bring you down again

168
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:13,520
Cheers Oh yep that's definitely spoiled

169
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:16,699
I should probably go to the bathroom

170
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,620
before I Oh God well at least I'm not

171
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:19,870
