the hawaii edition was it name of that

18
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,590
one Aloha State Aloha State let's see I

19
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:56,230
should know that we should know that why

20
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,430
I didn't watch it huh no but I did a

21
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:01,210
little bit of research so I knew that

22
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:05,080
anyway we met a few months ago and I

23
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:06,460
said I was a big fan it was a mind

24
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:15,550
blowing for me because I was a huge fan

25
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:18,580
of you yeah I I am so just for people

26
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:22,180
who don't know Terrace house is a it's a

27
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:24,640
Japanese reality show it's on Netflix

28
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:28,930
and Fuji TV in Japan three guys and

29
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:32,080
three girls living together and romance

30
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:34,600
or their life focus on their lifestyle

31
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:37,630
just think of like a wholesome Jersey

32
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,890
Shore or real world kind of thing honey

33
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,470
I don't know how to explain because I

34
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,060
never liked those show like reality

35
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,560
shows but that Terrace house was the

36
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,090
first one I could actually watch really

37
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,000
oh and I think it's because it doesn't

38
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:51,670
look like there's there's minor things I

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,250
don't know how what's so a big lievable

40
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:56,650
it is that could be a cools you into

41
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,630
like the normalities of it's not

42
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:00,670
dramatic like people fighting every day

43
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:02,260
every episode and well I don't know

44
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:06,280
maybe there's some truth behind those

45
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:08,229
lights or something goes yeah I think

46
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,739
that's interesting to hear because I

47
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:14,230
hear a lot of people from foreigners a

48
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:16,239
lot that they want to learn Japanese or

49
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:18,910
like they're learning the Japanese

50
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,760
culture and that's like the most people

51
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:24,400
who watch us like the show right well I

52
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,810
mean watching it just like the there's

53
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,220
things I didn't even happen ease I don't

54
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,920
even know because that's not my culture

55
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,299
no I'm Americanized so just like

56
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,489
watching that show and seeing like the

57
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:36,010
little things that get on peoples nerves

58
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:38,350
I guess or like the way that it's just

59
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,390
such a different maybe that's what's

60
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:42,370
appealing to me it was Japanese culture

61
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:44,680
and how's everyone's so polite and the

62
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:47,260
moment there's like you stray away from

63
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:52,209
that a little bit it's

64
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:56,590
offensive I mean depends what you do and

65
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:58,510
stuff but I think yeah well let's talk a

66
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,680
little bit about who you are

67
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:02,110
cuz you knows for some people who

68
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,640
haven't even seen this show they they

69
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,680
don't even know who you are in the first

70
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,569
place uh you know where are you from

71
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,120
you know you're a lot younger than we

72
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:14,470
are twenty-one yeah

73
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:16,599
born in 1998 some time flowing right and

74
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:19,269
you were on the show at the age of what

75
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:21,610
eighteen eighty I was a senior in high

76
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:23,290
school and where were you born and

77
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,980
raised I was born and raised in Tokyo

78
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,379
Japan

79
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:29,049
a place called hot tea oh gee and I

80
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:30,730
never went to international school just

81
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:33,069
a regular public school until seventh

82
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:34,989
grade and after that my entire family

83
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:37,720
moved to Hawaii about six and a half

84
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:40,780
years ago so went to a local high school

85
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:43,720
graduated so you can speak this well in

86
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:46,420
six and a half years well I'm still

87
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,459
learning my dad is from actually my dad

88
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,440
is japanese-american so he's uh who was

89
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:52,660
born and raised in Portland Oregon okay

90
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:56,799
so I understood what he was talking

91
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:58,959
about but I so my mom's from a normal

92
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,239
way too but spoke like Japanese to both

93
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,590
of them it's still like pretty

94
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:04,989
impressive that you're being able to

95
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:07,419
pick it up cuz I originally just hearing

96
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:09,459
you talk I thought you were American

97
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:11,739
raised that's a compliment in Hawaii

98
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:14,500
there's like no accent whatsoever

99
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:16,750
yeah well yeah you have the laid-back

100
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:20,200
kind of personality of a Hawaii person

101
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:25,150
as well well I mean I'm from oi you know

102
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:30,180
what I mean though cuz he's even better

103
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:32,830
than people from is great like in

104
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:37,360
American people probably think you speak

105
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:40,030
better English than the two of us Wow

106
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,139
maybe you just learn the right way well

107
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:44,110
that means you're really smart that

108
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:47,260
means you did well in school probably I

109
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:48,610
always follow my passions your position

110
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:52,389
we can talk about that so you actually

111
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:54,160
even on the show you were well you do a

112
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:56,229
lot of things but you were primarily

113
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,240
what oh cool a player I played the

114
00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:00,880
ukulele acoustic guitar and I'm a

115
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,620
singer-songwriter currently and

116
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,570
now you're doing shows and stuff yes

117
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:07,870
going back and forth would you say most

118
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:09,240
your fans are like no you from terrorist

119
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:13,090
Isles

120
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:15,340
yes I think so but oh no what is your

121
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,590
fan base like because you know ever

122
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,930
since Netflix has acquired the rights to

123
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:23,650
terrorist house I'm sure that has got to

124
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:25,420
new like international fans yes it was

125
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,670
pretty mind-blowing for me too because I

126
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,080
did not know first that it's gonna be on

127
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:31,870
Netflix that I was like only for

128
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,000
Japanese TV but when I first noticed

129
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:36,910
that oh like an English comment I

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,790
posed and after it had like a lot of

131
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:42,400
stuff happen and it's I was happy you

132
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:44,650
know and bless and ever get to never

133
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,670
thought of like experiencing stuff like

134
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:51,460
this and I'd say a lot of people are

135
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:53,980
from Japan or in Japan your fan base fan

136
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:57,450
base yes but at the same time some

137
00:05:53,980 --> 00:06:00,970
people are from US Canada Europe

138
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:01,360
Philippines Thailand Brazil I'm just

139
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,040
blessed

140
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,770
you're a worldwide sensation and

141
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,410
multi-talented I was kind of shocked how

142
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:11,110
many people like not just in Japan and

143
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:13,570
on like how many people watched Harris

144
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:15,100
house like it's a Japanese reality show

145
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,990
it doesn't make sense that all of us

146
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,870
would love it so much but it's it's huge

147
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:21,940
like I mean if you know you know a lot

148
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:24,250
of people don't watch it but the people

149
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:28,060
that do it's like they're super into it

150
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:30,460
I agree actually you know um a lot of

151
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,260
agent people lie doesn't matter if it if

152
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,390
the person is Japanese or Chinese or

153
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:36,070
Korean like a lot of agent people

154
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:39,040
basically watches the show which is

155
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:45,240
pretty mind-blowing to me too or if

156
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:45,240
anyone's dating Mazin they watch it

157
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:54,820
watch it like so like me my wife or my

158
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:57,040
husband I'm wondering like is there just

159
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:59,890
I'm sure there are I'm bothered song

160
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,240
really racist but is there like I wonder

161
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:03,160
if there's people who are just like what

162
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,140
in a white group that watches terror

163
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,870
cells I'm fine I feel like is that rare

164
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:09,340
like in the Midwest because it's not

165
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,190
Netflix so anyone can watch it right

166
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,630
it's not where I think but like most of

167
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,569
them aren't like Asian people both like

168
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:17,179
I do

169
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:19,009
receive some comments to like you know

170
00:07:17,179 --> 00:07:20,240
that's non-asian so what's the puted and

171
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:22,189
do they just like because i know there's

172
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,139
some people just like japanese culture

173
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:26,419
exactly like whoever likes japanese

174
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:29,959
culture or you know who's interested

175
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:31,490
yeah to see what is it like in japan or

176
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:32,119
i'd like to live with japanese people

177
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,879
right

178
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:36,469
i will say this is to the audience

179
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:40,669
anyone listening right now or watching

180
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:42,139
it sounds i'm just gonna be completely

181
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:45,379
honest it sounds like the most boring

182
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:46,909
show in the world but then that's what i

183
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:48,709
thought initially watching one episode i

184
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:50,569
was like oh that was alright i guess

185
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:52,309
i'll watch another one oh I got addicted

186
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:56,270
I actually felt the same when I just

187
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:58,610
heard about the name before ello has

188
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:01,189
state only knew about the name I never

189
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,659
watched it and I could totally relate to

190
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,699
you cuz like that's what I thought yeah

191
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:06,830
the description right three guys three

192
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:08,869
girls living in a house yeah and and

193
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:10,009
nothing really like it's hard to say

194
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:11,689
nothing happens because when you

195
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:15,469
compared to American reality shows right

196
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:17,479
like Jersey Shore yeah it's more a world

197
00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:18,919
that's so dramatic people are fighting

198
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:20,569
punching each other and stuffing and

199
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:22,309
then and then you watch this show and

200
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:24,469
everybody's so polite and nice to each

201
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:26,599
other then the cameras just set on a

202
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:29,809
tripod is like beautifully shot it's not

203
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:31,579
like extreme zoom ins and shaky cameras

204
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:33,289
to make everything look more hectic you

205
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:34,519
know it's very calm and relaxing and

206
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:37,759
it's like watch some people eating

207
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:39,860
dinner yeah it's a like you ma but it's

208
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:43,069
really a isn't it more so about like

209
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,569
your the the viewer is thinking about

210
00:08:43,069 --> 00:08:46,069
like what they're thinking like what are

211
00:08:44,569 --> 00:08:47,810
they thinking when they're silently

212
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:49,639
eating together what's going through

213
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:52,250
their mind right all the little nuances

214
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:54,439
of like human interaction I think that's

215
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,699
what's really right funny and

216
00:08:54,439 --> 00:08:57,860
interesting and also having the

217
00:08:55,699 --> 00:09:01,040
commentators right the what do you guys

218
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:03,319

224
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,649
that there's basically for those that

225
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,240
don't know you guys have a reality show

226
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:19,339
but in between the show there's

227
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,410
commentators commenting on every little

228
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:23,510
thing people say like people they don't

229
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:25,699
like they're celebrities right yes they

230
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:27,500

girls like Japanese Paco and I could be

238
00:09:51,199 --> 00:10:02,959
like I do not or did I pass the word so

239
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:04,699
when the show is coming out it's

240
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,069
sometimes it's not finished why you guys

241
00:10:04,699 --> 00:10:09,319
are still recording right like no you

242
00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:12,170
see yourselves like as a show a film

243
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:13,910
that's the cringe your awkward part of

244
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:16,639
the show cuz we're gonna see ourselves

245
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:19,999
when that's released right inside the

246
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:22,550
house which we did so you know remember

247
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:24,499
the scene that oh like are you

248
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:26,389
interested on the you know anyone or a

249
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:29,290
boiler who's your like favorite like

blah blah blah blah and that scene is

252
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:38,509
out and right we watched it and it was

253
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:40,129
pre awkward well I was wondering cuz

254
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:42,709
there's I mean again spoiler alert

255
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:44,959
there's there's moments where you got

256
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:46,399
like in earlier episodes you guys all I

257
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,899
feel like in every season they always

258
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,250
talk about oh who are you interested in

259
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:51,050
you know and you're just like a private

260
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:53,120
conversation with the boys private

261
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,860
conversation with the girls but it you

262
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,420
know you're being filmed so like you

263
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:58,790
know that other person's gonna see it

264
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,649
right mmm don't I mean doesn't that

265
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:02,829
affect I mean I don't I don't know maybe

266
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:05,050
I feel like I would be affected by

267
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:09,379
knowing that that person's gonna see it

268
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:13,040
well I wasn't for me personally I didn't

269
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:15,829
know like that it'll be on that that

270
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,559
early first of all so I wasn't so I

271
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:20,209
don't know like maybe others like they

272
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:21,860
knew about it so you were you being like

273
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:24,199
completely just like oh these are my

274
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:26,449
honest feelings cuz you were very honest

275
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:30,079
by the time that they said yeah I'm out

276
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:31,999
here on his human being no but uh yeah I

277
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,399
wasn't I wasn't thinking about that at

278
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:38,899
all you're just being authentically you

279
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:40,730
I think so like the part is that you

280
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:43,070
know I could say for sure that I

281
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,930
is nervous a lot for the first couple

282
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:47,029
weeks cuz you know like living with

283
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:50,839
strangers and I was like the youngest

284
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:53,089
you know uh the other cast Eric and even

285
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:55,459
they're like you know 27 26 and that

286
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:56,529
time and they were like 10 years older

287
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:59,540
than me you know

288
00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:01,220
so I was you know a little pressure like

289
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,800
and I was kind of you know scared they

290
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,480
couldn't like me or not and stuff but

291
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,190
you know once I kind of got used to it

292
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,550
and got close with them and stuff

293
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:13,639
everything is fine okay yeah did you um

294
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:15,680
I guess I don't know if you can talk

295
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:17,660
about this or not but like did was there

296
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,980
anything that you'd I know you can't

297
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,959
answer this I don't why I'm asking but

298
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,810
is there any way that you really didn't

299
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,970
get along with their it's got to be

300
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:27,949
annoying living with two other dudes in

301
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:30,170
the same room that's like it's not it's

302
00:12:27,949 --> 00:12:32,449
not just housemates it's roommates right

303
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,920
and then three girls like right down the

304
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:35,420
hall I don't know if it's down the hall

305
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,120
but like in the same house you know it's

306
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:40,130
a beautiful house but there's got to be

307
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,930
some things that get that got you a lil

308
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:47,209
annoyed I don't know if you can say what

309
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:55,790
you can say I could say that right now I

310
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:57,709
love them all today for sure that the

311
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:59,360
whole purpose is you know we all have

312
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:01,399
different personalities everyone's

313
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,260
different and for a low estate what's

314
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:05,420
interesting is that there's people

315
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:07,639
that's Japanese Japanese from Japan but

316
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,839
there's also local people so there's

317
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:10,730
gonna be you know some culture

318
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:11,990
differences how they think different

319
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,870
yeah for sure

320
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:16,880
so yeah you know like might be tough

321
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,649
sometimes but they kind of you know get

322
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,720
that long I mean you've seen like Eric P

323
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:22,760
and L mean that scene to you yeah so

324
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,949
stuff like that and could you explain

325
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,720
what happens between this cuz I haven't

326
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:28,010
seen it so well Justin we were talking

327
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,440
about this earlier just like Japanese

328
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:32,329
culture in general is so different for

329
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,860
like what's acceptable and what isn't

330
00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:35,420
you don't sometimes you don't even know

331
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,100
I think in that snare without spoiling

332
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:39,110
anything you don't even know that you're

333
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,399
being offensive to someone when you are

334
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,769
in a different culture because you

335
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,630
wouldn't it's not considered offensive

336
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:47,000
in their culture in your own culture or

337
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:49,579
like even you're originally from Japan

338
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,640
but if you you know used to the

339
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:53,569
environment that you're know been around

340
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,560
then you might say something offensive

341
00:13:53,569 --> 00:13:56,240
right

342
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,370
because you just forget about it yeah

343
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,830
well so you're indirectly saying that

344
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:05,029
there are some people in there in the

345
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:06,740
house that may not have you may not have

346
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:08,570
liked what are you trying to fish out of

347
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:14,930
him right now I don't think you said

348
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:16,250
anything about that's though would you

349
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:18,290
say you're friends with everybody

350
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:22,880
mm-hmm and you're close to everybody

351
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:25,670
well um I'd say no cuz everyone lives in

352
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,560
a different place some people live in

353
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:30,440
Japan so who lives in Hawaii somebody

354
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,630
lives in LA or mainly New York yeah

355
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,210
so you know we're going our separate

356
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:37,040
ways but I'm totally cool with everyone

357
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:39,410
and I think everyone's cool like you

358
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,790
know we're on the most recent season as

359
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:43,339
well they brought you back yes

360
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:45,620
Tokyo 2019 2020 so you're in right now

361
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:47,450
only part 1 of the new season is out

362
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,320
there's another part are you can you say

363
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:55,160
if you're in that as well

364
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:56,990
we'll see yeah I have a question about

365
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,540
it's like because you know not everybody

366
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:03,080
has the opportunity to be on a reality

367
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:04,580
TV show right and you know I think a lot

368
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,140
of people do wonder about the camera

369
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:08,150
situation like how many cameras were

370
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:11,420
there it was it just like a bunch of

371
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:15,170
like webcams that were set everywhere or

372
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:17,839
I'm nervous or just like good quality

373
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:20,330
there yeah or just like DSLR cameras or

374
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,790
whatever is I think he said he can't you

375
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:26,120
can't say right behind the scenes stuff

376
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:27,770
okay well Avenger it depends I will say

377
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,600
there's a reason why we're wondering

378
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:32,060
because no one's allowed to say anything

379
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,030
on that show I feel like I tried to

380
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:37,370
google it before it's just because it

381
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:39,170
shot so differently that is I think

382
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:41,660
that's another attraction where people

383
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:44,870
are like how are they filming it with

384
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:47,780
and getting these like raw real motions

385
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:49,610
from people that's not over-the-top yeah

386
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:52,430
I mean I have a friend who was actually

387
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:55,010
a director for a reality TV show mm-hmm

388
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:57,760
and he told because I asked him some

389
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:59,540
questions about how reality TV shot and

390
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,000
some of the things that he mentioned

391
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:03,800
where it was that like he will like

392
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,080
everything's real but there would be

393
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,060
certain scenarios that he would kind of

394
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:10,250
create like yep

395
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:13,310
all can say hey this person kind of said

396
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:16,310
this thing about you and you know like I

397
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:19,160
I like I don't know normal in reality

398
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:20,300
shows that right uh no we got we did not

399
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,850
have that oh really

400
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,680
um yeah so like the park is say for sure

401
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,280
that there's no script there's no paper

402
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,860
to script

403
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:30,140
oh no it's Harris house hmm so but I

404
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,610
mean you know like how you guys like

405
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:33,920
there's a camera rolling someone walks

406
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:36,350
into a room and then all of a sudden

407
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,390
every like the cameras or the camera

408
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:41,300
rolling all that time that's a lot of

409
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:43,100
wasted footage you know I'm saying like

410
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,900
someone has to turn that camera on I

411
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,250
mean I know you can't answer that but

412
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:49,670
I'm just saying like that's what I

413
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:52,070
wondered about it's like how obviously

414
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:54,650
I'll weed the same yes yeah yeah I'm

415
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:56,420
like he walked into the room there's no

416
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:58,460
way like the cameraman is on a tripod

417
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,920
there's no way the cameras just there is

418
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,030
just waiting for him right yeah I was

419
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,750
like and if they're not filming the

420
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,970
whole time is that's high quality

421
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:08,540
footage there's no way they have that

422
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:10,190
much space hold all that footage anyway

423
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,570
we'll get all away from the behind the

424
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:15,470
scenes stuff no you can't talk about it

425
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:18,260
anyway but I mean in general I will say

426
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:20,090
I mean you kind of in a way blew up from

427
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,950
the show right I think everybody like

428
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:23,870
different levels right like Lauren

429
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:25,610
really blew up from the show do you like

430
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:27,710
she's like on a TV show now right I know

431
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:28,970
it's crazy yeah and then you're doing

432
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,860
shows all over the place which you

433
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:33,050
weren't necessarily doing before like

434
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:35,810
touring and yeah I mean I'm just blessed

435
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:37,220
and unlucky well you're skilled I mean

436
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:39,710
there's a reason why people were

437
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:41,900
impressed by you and it's also very like

438
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:44,690
on the show they were talking about it

439
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:48,100
like how'd your you have such a it's

440
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:50,120
like a what's that demeanor : very um

441
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,050
introverted I guess I don't know if

442
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,880
you're an introvert I'm just assuming

443
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:54,260
anyway you seem very like yeah sly it

444
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,380
but then when you play them clearly when

445
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:58,850
you play instruments you're like crazy

446
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:03,590
well I mean I'm happy to hear that uh

447
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:08,630
you know oh another thing um I never

448
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:10,570
really wore pajamas before but for sure

449
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:13,160
house and stuff I wanted to be polite

450
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:14,720
said that's why I decided to bring my

451
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,950
pajamas but never thought of like

452
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,990
receiving lots of like positive

453
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:19,910
feedbacks same for like the first

454
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:21,950
episode right yeah and same for my

455
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:24,169
personalities you know I was in

456
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:27,049
affecting to recede like no feedbacks

457
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:28,220
like that you know oh he he's acting

458
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:30,950
completely different way he plays a

459
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:33,200
guitar oh cool oh right I was like

460
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:36,110
really like never thought of that

461
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,600
yeah so it's it's I think the part

462
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:41,029
that's interesting for me or like other

463
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:44,419
cast members is that you're able to look

464
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:47,090
at yourself on the screen mmm from like

465
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:48,500
the third point of view right because

466
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:51,110
you're not used to just seeing your

467
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:54,169
everyday life because she'll definitely

468
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:56,389
learn a lot from it you know where

469
00:18:54,169 --> 00:19:00,440
there's some things in in the show that

470
00:18:56,389 --> 00:19:01,760
you wish they didn't cut out for they or

471
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,309
that they are you wish that you that

472
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:08,570
they did it did or they did yeah

473
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:10,519
probably you wish they did but I'm sure

474
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:12,169
they picked the best moments yeah like

475
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:14,570
they can't show everything yeah it's not

476
00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:14,929
it's only sure for sure what in 45

477
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:18,860
minutes

478
00:19:14,929 --> 00:19:22,580
in episode something like that oh well

479
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:25,779
they cut it out you probably can't say I

480
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:28,519
want it to be cut or like I wanted

481
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:32,029
things you wish shouldn't have made it

482
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:36,850
well back then definitely the scene when

483
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:36,850
I eat catfish alone good scene though

484
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:45,230
yeah nowadays it's super hilarious like

485
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:46,580
it's it's funny I love can you describe

486
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:51,010
the scene for those who haven't seen it

487
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:54,460
well I went out or you know that with a

488
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:58,100
the cast one of the cast members and

489
00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:01,130

00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:19,299
yeah and after the movie you know it was

496
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:22,840
supposed to be a surprise and I

497
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:24,950
reservation like at the place a

498
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:28,250
restaurant a restaurant yep

499
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:33,799
and I asked her if you want to go eat

500
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:35,260
dinner and I Khloe got declined well

501
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:38,780
what was her excuse

502
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:39,890
she had grandparents dinner or something

503
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:45,740
like that I really hope she doesn't

504
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:47,980
watch this it's all in fact we're gonna

505
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:50,350
clip it in sent and tweeted to her

506
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:53,180
that's even better that's better

507
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:54,830
she said that she had to go to dinner

508
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,870
with her grandparents which is a lot it

509
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:58,370
was something like reasonable sure it

510
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:00,080
was just I mean but then you got to see

511
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:01,520
the behind the scene just which is what

512
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,130
I was talking about earlier of what like

513
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,390
she was saying well I think she really

514
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:09,140
didn't have to do I don't know if that's

515
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:11,440
true or not well I mean you know I think

516
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:14,570
family is important what I could say

517
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,800
family is important you know like you

518
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:20,000
don't know what's gonna happen like

519
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:22,760
anytime so I'm such a nice guy I think

520
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,740
it's a nice so you're too nice so she

521
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,590
had to go have dinner with her

522
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:29,390
grandparents and then and then you went

523
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:32,090
to dinner that you made a reservation

524
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:36,200
for two with you went alone and then you

525
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:39,170
ordered a catfish yes that was my first

526
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,480
catfish and you know I did not want when

527
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:49,070
I you know cancel the whole reservation

528
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:51,650
and why not I mean I feel like most

529
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:53,750
people would have done that but that's

530
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:55,940
why his he was so interesting on the

531
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:57,500
show you know cuz she actually went well

532
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,450
it was like you know pretty close for

533
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:02,600
the movie theaters so yeah why not you

534
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:04,490
know some stuff and then basically the

535
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,710
what was sad about it is he there's a

536
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:08,900
shot and he's just eating alone after

537
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:10,340
being rejected essentially and it was

538
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,360
just very sick it was like a very like

539
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,340
heartbreaking but man because

540
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,690
everybody's ruined for him you know but

541
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:21,530
let me ask you this did you enjoy the

542
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:25,670
catfish I tasted a bunch of emotions but

543
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:27,950
actually fun story on this trip in LA I

544
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:30,590
have any catfish for like three years

545
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:33,770
after that and recently a few days ago

546
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:35,030
actually ate catfish wow that's an and

547
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:39,020
then what happened it tasted a lot

548
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:42,740
better and now he's back ladies he's

549
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:46,010
back on the market the bats kiichi he's

550
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:47,929
gone I wouldn't know I think they moved

551
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:48,740
it or something right or it's gone like

552
00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:50,750
that

553
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:53,659
have more anything from it but uh I

554
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:55,669
think one thing that I read online um

555
00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:57,049
that they're talking about like you're a

556
00:22:55,669 --> 00:23:01,159
virgin or something when you went on the

557
00:22:57,049 --> 00:23:02,539
show yes what I mean the hope I think

558
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:03,710
that what you said initially coming on

559
00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:06,620
with some or I mean it's

560
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:09,260
I never gone in a relationship yeah yes

561
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:11,570
so like complete then just like yeah

562
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:13,940
never had a girlfriend never kissed a

563
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:18,440
girl and has never changed since the

564
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:23,600
show you know it

565
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:26,929
Netflix popularity baby one I mean I'm

566
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,659
sure you've already said everything

567
00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:32,929
without saying anything but I'm

568
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:35,029
definitely still bad on it you know so I

569
00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:38,120
want to ask you Riley where I Ryan any

570
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:42,409
tips for for me like for dating advice

571
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:44,270
you're asking me yeah I mean I don't

572
00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:48,320
know if I'm the best person like I'm not

573
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:52,090
known for picking up girls well I would

574
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:56,029
say right one I would say naturally your

575
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:57,380
your genuine kindness seems to be a gift

576
00:23:56,029 --> 00:23:59,450
and I think if you're just more

577
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:01,820
confident with that you seem a lot more

578
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:03,049
confident already from the show at least

579
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,490
just talking to I mean you're talking to

580
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:05,870
us like it's nothing and they con the

581
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:08,419
show it seemed like you were struggling

582
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:10,610
to just talk to people initially but it

583
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:13,130
seemed to improve over time and I

584
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:14,240
haven't seen the new season with you in

585
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,919
it

586
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,809
I was gonna wait on to the next part

587
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:21,919
comes out and watch it all at once I can

588
00:24:17,809 --> 00:24:23,210
binge it awesome but yeah I mean just

589
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,490
talking to you now is kind of shocked

590
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:27,020
before like because I hadn't met you

591
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:29,360
except for that one time and we barely

592
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:31,070
got to talk and I didn't know what to

593
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,149
expect to be honest I mean that's

594
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:34,700
another thing about those reality shows

595
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:36,610
like you get an idea of a person mm-hmm

596
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,779
but they're not always exactly like that

597
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:40,610
or maybe you've changed a lot I don't

598
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:43,270
know well I could totally say you know

599
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:46,250
I've been there a lot over 30 years but

600
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:49,669
you know things about a show reality

601
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:54,770
show is that what they show it's it is a

602
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:57,169
part of me but it's not everything of me

603
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:58,850
you know and there's always gonna be

604
00:24:57,169 --> 00:25:00,740
like some fun parts with me and

605
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:01,430
hopefully I could you know show more of

606
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:04,940
that

607
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:07,850
my life journey is there anyone that you

608
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:09,650
feel like not necessarily acts but like

609
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:11,300
they know they're on camera so they're

610
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,830
acting differently from when the cameras

611
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:16,910
are off

612
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:19,250
you can't talk but yeah

613
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:21,110
what is your break no spice we do but

614
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:24,050
but I think before we go to the sushi

615
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:29,780
break you did bring your guitar here

616
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:31,430

617
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,530
add that as our she she we've never had

618
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:36,320
a live performance here

619
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:38,000
really we've never no never I think you

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,120

that and uh uh and look like after all

652
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:29,890

00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:33,220

00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:36,310

yeah I never met him but everybody in

659
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,530
Hawaii knew about him just because he

660
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:47,590
was the guy who could play they were

661
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:50,890

00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:57,490
nervous like yeah yeah it was pretty

664
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:58,810
crazy yeah so what else is going on I

665
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:03,190
mean you're here here in LA right now

666
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:06,730
doing what shows here or mainly creating

667
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:11,350
the EP right now and uh so this is your

668
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:13,120
third it's actually my first EP and then

669
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:18,070
what are these two things so those two

670
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:20,170
are albums my instrumental albums I made

671
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:23,650
it a while ago actually from high school

672
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:28,360
mm-hmm and I had couple albums from

673
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:31,890
Japan but you know it's unreal label

674
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:34,090
yeah and uh yeah things kind of changed

675
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:35,530
well you look very different I mean you

676
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:36,370
obviously a lot younger but you look

677
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:38,950
very different

678
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:41,320
you said you were thank you you would I

679
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:43,929
mean he lost a lot of weight I did I

680
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:47,320
lost about 35 pounds after

681
00:28:43,929 --> 00:28:50,889
to tokyo serious thank you well I mean

682
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:54,129
that's a that's a lot like what what

683
00:28:50,889 --> 00:28:56,830
sparked it like why all of a sudden well

684
00:28:54,129 --> 00:29:00,279
you know I wanted to you know be a best

685
00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:02,799
version of myself and I think you know

686
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:05,110
once I get the attention from the

687
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:08,619
viewers as how the show goes

688
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:10,659
you know I love the fans and stuff too

689
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:13,659
but you know I also try not like listen

690
00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:20,350
to some people who gives out like

691
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:22,749
suggestions trying to be like little but

692
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:24,549
really I feel like we're in a time right

693
00:29:22,749 --> 00:29:27,090
now where people want the opposite

694
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:31,450
they're all about body positivity and

695
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:33,279
silence yeah but I mean I I'm assuming

696
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:35,139
with all that positivity there's always

697
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,419
gonna be comments that are the opposite

698
00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:39,429
right naturally trolling and yes and

699
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:42,720
that really affected you mm-hmm the

700
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:45,070
thing about this show is dad you know

701
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,350
people are gonna criticize see you

702
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:48,789
you know people everyone is different

703
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:51,970
you know everyone has a different

704
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:53,769
opinion so if I do this on the screen

705
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:55,570
people think how yourself like done dad

706
00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:57,070
right and said you know there's like

707
00:29:55,570 --> 00:30:01,480
everything going on everyone has an

708
00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:03,519
opinion about you yes yes man I can't

709
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:09,399
see a lot of negative opinions about you

710
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:12,429
though again what what can I like what

711
00:30:09,399 --> 00:30:14,049
like what I mean this is one thing where

712
00:30:12,429 --> 00:30:15,639
it's just like you're too conservative

713
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:16,720
you know you're too kind

714
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:18,879
where you put other people before

715
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,080
yourself which is sometimes like are you

716
00:30:18,879 --> 00:30:21,789
really living your best life at that

717
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,529
point are you mate are you really making

718
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:25,149
the right decisions for yourself or are

719
00:30:23,529 --> 00:30:27,669
you living for the gratification of

720
00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:29,110
others mm-hmm so a lot of times when you

721
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:32,110
hold yourself back like that people can

722
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:33,669
be frustrated because people uh you know

723
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:35,289
they want which is weird because they're

724
00:30:33,669 --> 00:30:36,429
living through you in a way where

725
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:37,869
they're like oh you should have been

726
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:39,610
yourself this is where you should have

727
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:40,389
broke free they would have done yeah

728
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:41,860
exactly

729
00:30:40,389 --> 00:30:45,039
so that's why I like those are the type

730
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:47,649
of criticisms or you know like when I

731
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:49,059
guess the awkward situations and like

732
00:30:47,649 --> 00:30:51,700
being rejected like oh you got rejected

733
00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:53,169
because of this I would've did that so I

734
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,029
mean yeah it's like those types of

735
00:30:53,169 --> 00:30:56,769
things but it's not saying it's not

736
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:57,220
saying he's a bad person no I know I'm

737
00:30:56,769 --> 00:30:59,320
saying

738
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:01,330
kind of surprised that that was the

739
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,409
thing they attacked you like I'm sure

740
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:04,510
that there is other reasons they

741
00:31:02,409 --> 00:31:06,340
attacked you but I mean to say like hey

742
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:08,710
lose weight or like you're too fat or

743
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:10,179
whatever you weren't I mean like you on

744
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:12,059
the show you weren't that like you

745
00:31:10,179 --> 00:31:14,520
weren't big I don't think you were

746
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:17,490
overweight yeah not it I don't think so

747
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:21,159
understand if you compare two Americans

748
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:22,419
Japanese in Japan it might be over

749
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:24,100
without where the comments came like

750
00:31:22,419 --> 00:31:26,169
that those comments came from mostly

751
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,940
Japanese fans or is it from Americans as

752
00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:29,799
well mostly from Japanese people

753
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:32,110
immediately you know like don't get me

754
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:38,020
wrong like everyone has you know people

755
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:40,809
yeah stuff but not a spoiler but before

756
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:44,230
part two is out I've received like a

757
00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:45,909
tons of more comments like that then

758
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:47,890
when I was appearing on although his

759
00:31:45,909 --> 00:31:50,500
state oh you the current season the

760
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:52,030
current season sees a lot of hate I did

761
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,900
mostly regarding your weight or

762
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:58,600
something else

763
00:31:52,900 --> 00:32:03,490
everything everything like you know just

764
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:06,190
just straight-up die and stuff you know

765
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:09,159
like I mean after all all the stuff that

766
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:10,960
you know has happened for the past three

767
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:13,539
years and especially like this year I

768
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:17,080
think I have a like thicker skin I have

769
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:18,820
a stronger mental and well not always

770
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,590
but I'm trying like thinking you know

771
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:22,539
positively you know yeah the more people

772
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:25,960
who wants me to die I want to live more

773
00:32:22,539 --> 00:32:27,820
and the more people who cost me fat then

774
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,650
I wanna you know lose more weight as

775
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:31,659
much as possible I mean not at the point

776
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:32,919
that I'm gonna like not you know have

777
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:35,110
like if he's just order something but uh

778
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:38,380
right you know just trying to be healthy

779
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:39,820
trying to be myself and I mean I don't

780
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,710
feel anything about it but like you know

781
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:45,190
for at that time it was pretty tough for

782
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:47,260
me that I couldn't share my emotions to

783
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:49,600
my fans are the crowd you know I just

784
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:51,640
get it act like nothing is going on but

785
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,919
you know that happens for everyone else

786
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:56,049
I think it does but I mean I think you

787
00:32:53,919 --> 00:33:00,400
have to a certain degree you have an

788
00:32:56,049 --> 00:33:01,750
image of like real real innocence and I

789
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,890
think I mean you even just sing and now

790
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:06,820
like you feel like you can't really

791
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:10,240
express yourself completely I feel like

792
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:10,930
I feel like you can like I think I think

793
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,180
I mean

794
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:14,980
I do like like in front of like my

795
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:17,290
friends or like you know but non-public

796
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:20,050
like face to face is that do you think

797
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:22,150
is that a Japanese culture thing culture

798
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:24,430
it's it's a long it's a long story like

799
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:26,110
well what uh what would happen if you

800
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:29,080
were to because you know in America

801
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:31,090
right like if you look on on YouTube and

802
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,950
a lot of these youtubers expressing

803
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:34,330
themselves expressing their I love it

804
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:35,710
like their depression and the things

805
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:37,240
their struggles and that they're going

806
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:38,320
through if you were to do that to a

807
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,660
Japanese audience

808
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,070
how will they generally react to

809
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:43,780
something like that don't wouldn't that

810
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:45,370
make this like feel a boo right is it

811
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,690
taboo or do they feel more like they

812
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:47,800
could relate to you and like oh I go

813
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:51,040
through that too and I want to support

814
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:52,540
you it really depends if it's like a fan

815
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,490
fan then you know gonna be like very

816
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:56,230
okay or you know like I want to relate

817
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:58,300
to you but like if it's like just other

818
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:59,770
everyone else then it'll be like like

819
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,240
don't give me that negative five I don't

820
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:03,940
want to I don't want to see that kind of

821
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:06,760
stuff right so it's it's not a it's

822
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:09,640
depends it depends on situations and

823
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:11,830
stuff that's what I know Japan is like I

824
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:13,810
mean traditionally like you don't like

825
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:15,070
even just like naturally me growing up

826
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:16,900
like we don't share you don't share your

827
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:18,670
feelings really you know with when

828
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:20,290
you're growing at least for me it's not

829
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:22,660
like we didn't have a loving home or

830
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:24,460
environment but if you're like I don't

831
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,900
know you I don't I never told my dad hey

832
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,910
I love you like you know like it's not

833
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,770
like in TV shows you don't really say

834
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:31,180
that at least in my household and all my

835
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:32,950
friends growing up around that time

836
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:34,870
maybe it's different now I think it's an

837
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:38,200
Asian thing yeah it is an Asian thing

838
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:40,240
yeah I think so maybe maybe not but I

839
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:42,970
feel like you're younger too but for me

840
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,010
um well the reason it started music is

841
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:46,990
you know to make people smile not only

842
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:49,690
kind of sounds cheesy but I want to you

843
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:52,330
know bring that positive vibes and what

844
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:53,020
I loved about you YouTube watching your

845
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:55,960
videos too

846
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:59,950
is it makes me smile like you know it

847
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:01,450
makes me positive overall and that's

848
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:05,470
what I want to do and I'm happy that

849
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:07,500
it's my job and you know effort like

850
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:09,990
this personal stuff instead I think it's

851
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:13,210
really no need to share that with people

852
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:15,370
but I only want to share something

853
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:17,830
that's happy with people right so you'd

854
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:19,750
like to bottle up that stuff in a way

855
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:20,890
which people say not to do but I mean I

856
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,960
think everybody does it to a certain

857
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:24,240
degree and I also think right now it's

858
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,609
almost

859
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,839
people at least in the US have been

860
00:35:26,609 --> 00:35:30,089
going in the opposite direction and

861
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:32,579
creating more drama because that's what

862
00:35:30,089 --> 00:35:34,980
has become like the thing right to share

863
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:36,690
your depression itself yeah which is I

864
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,700
mean I like I said I think the stigma

865
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:41,369
should go away and I'm glad that people

866
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:44,550
are sharing this stuff but I think

867
00:35:41,369 --> 00:35:46,140
there's also people who are how do you

868
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:47,520
say like that it's being over there

869
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,780
taking advantage of the situation

870
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,250
yeah because it's almost like becoming

871
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,380
like I don't want to see a trend because

872
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:54,180
that sounds disrespectful but it's kind

873
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:57,510
of becoming that and I feel like if you

874
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:59,460
can't get away with that it's a very it

875
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:01,619
just it just sees I see the difference

876
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:03,240
in the cultures essentially if you were

877
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:05,220
to do that I could see why your Japanese

878
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,869
fans would be like no what are you

879
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:08,069
whining about like keep it to yourself

880
00:36:06,869 --> 00:36:09,630
kind of thing I don't know if that's

881
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:11,940
true I'm just like I'm top of my head

882
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:14,490
maybe I mean sooner or later a might

883
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:16,410
just be like oh whatever just start

884
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:18,329
showing my emotions and stuff but I mean

885
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:20,010
for most of times I'm I'm pretty happy

886
00:36:18,329 --> 00:36:22,290
all right I try to be positive kind of

887
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:26,490
guy so right you take the negative and

888
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:28,440
you use it too yeah like now I feel

889
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:31,020
better if I received those comments

890
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,480
because I get more you know motivation

891
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:35,460
you know talking about the catfish you

892
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:37,680
know like reject me more or exactly more

893
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:41,609
like one more rejection you know a lot

894
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,920
more haters so so that I could go like

895
00:36:41,609 --> 00:36:45,059
you know I could motivate myself and be

896
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,309
a better person

897
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:49,309
well we all hate you here so oh thanks

898
00:36:53,599 --> 00:37:00,720
this list 10 things we hate about Eden

899
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:02,940
and oh wow I know it's surprising only

900
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,920
10 there's way more to be hundred over

901
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:06,809
hundred we get some of this like the

902
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,799

941
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:09,940

about personalities like girls were a

956
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:45,160
little more quiet

957
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:47,380

like that's a skill you I mean I know

964
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:06,160
you can mentioned it on the show but is

965
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:07,930
that a skill that you learned from being

966
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,550
on the show because it seemed like over

967
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:12,340
the course of those episodes that you

968
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:14,500
were on it improved for you you seem to

969
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:17,770
really shy and then you slowly started

970
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:22,570
opening up but I feel definitely better

971
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:24,220

972
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:27,400

1013
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:25,290
to be polite and stuff but sometimes you

1014
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:27,960

1015
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:30,780

1018
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:37,920

1019
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:39,540
much yeah no I mean I hundred percent

1020
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,280
agree because I mean I only went there

1021
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:42,810
for like I was there like a month ago

1022
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,900
and I was only there for like a couple

1023
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:47,700
weeks and I've been there maybe three or

1024
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:50,940
four times not very long and every time

1025
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:54,390
I go it's always like everyone is so

1026
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:57,180
polite and so nice to you that like you

1027
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:59,730
I feel brewed by just existing and not

1028
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:00,840
following you know I mean like I'm own

1029
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:02,820
America and like I

1030
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:05,310
oh shoot was I supposed to like just

1031
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:07,380
little things like I read on oh I didn't

1032
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:08,490
read I saw a video too saying like how

1033
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:10,230
to take trains and stuff like that I

1034
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:12,690
didn't know how to how to do any of that

1035
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:14,190
and then like just just rules and like I

1036
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:16,020
didn't know but I was doing it I was

1037
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:18,380
like talking on the train and I noticed

1038
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:20,010
oh wait no one talks on the train I

1039
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:21,480
don't I didn't know that was an

1040
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:23,220
etiquette thing I don't know if that's

1041
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:26,120
true or not but I mean no one talks to

1042
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:29,480
each other on the train and I was just

1043
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:35,250
big old English American accent just

1044
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:36,390
talking to people no I mean it's just

1045
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:38,220
like little things like that I didn't

1046
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:42,180
even think about but like it's mmm

1047
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:44,370
everyone is so polite and I feel like

1048
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:46,590
it's not real I don't know if that's

1049
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:48,450
true enough but I feel like nobody can

1050
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:50,250
be sown Hatt likes put on a smile and

1051
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:51,630
treat you so nicely all the time like

1052
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:52,950
there has to be some pointed then though

1053
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:54,480
it's just like I don't like you they're

1054
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:57,450
really suppressing like their real

1055
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,650
emotions yeah and I feel like I don't I

1056
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:59,940
can't tell because everyone's so nice

1057
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:02,220
but when you're there long enough you're

1058
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:04,620
like this is kind of suspicious nice

1059
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:08,730
they are so that's why they're mostly

1060
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:09,780
honest on internet but I could I just

1061
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:11,370
say you know there

1062
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:14,580
really committed which is not a bad

1063
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:16,920
thing at all but Japanese people like

1064
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:19,680
their early commit only what they're

1065
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,420
doing yeah but you know sometimes when

1066
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:25,320
it kind of goes too much then you know

1067
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:27,030
they're they get super exhausted or they

1068
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:29,670
you know you know the situation like

1069
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:31,080
they work too much yeah they all of a

1070
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:33,740
sudden like blackout and stuff and

1071
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:37,290
that's what's been going on a lot and

1072
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:38,850
yeah so I think that's you know it's all

1073
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:40,890
about the balance there's pros and cons

1074
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:44,850
that reasons yes yes exactly like

1075
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:47,370
Japanese people they have like like you

1076
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:48,870
said one of the best work ethics but to

1077
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:52,080
the point where sometimes like there is

1078
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:55,110
exhaustion and I think Japan has one of

1079
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:56,970
the highest suicide rates to which is it

1080
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:59,330
an unfortunate fact but it does come

1081
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:01,140
with the fact of being unable to express

1082
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:03,270
emotionally where you're at right

1083
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:05,310
because you're you know or and the

1084
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:08,520
expression only a correlation yeah and

1085
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:10,740
the expectation because yet to get into

1086
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:13,380
high school you have to test right yes

1087
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:14,610
and even then there are certain high

1088
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,830
schools that are very good and if you

1089
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:18,870
don't make into that it's looked down

1090
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:20,280
it's not like a CT that he could just

1091
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:22,020
take it over and over again if you just

1092
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:25,050
mess you get away for another year and

1093
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:27,180
there's such a huge pressure it's

1094
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:28,590
heavily looked down on I I don't know

1095
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:31,110
how much I could say about it but like

1096
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:32,580
you know people now does its kind

1097
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:34,440
different before people used to lay

1098
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:37,250
judge from like what kind of school you

1099
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:40,050
went like no matter like friendship or

1100
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:41,850
work right you know he didn't get into a

1101
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:43,590
good school the people who did look down

1102
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:46,350
on the other people right so for me like

1103
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:48,600
I never attended college you know

1104
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:51,390
graduate high school yeah in gosh

1105
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:54,900
trained into music so that what did they

1106
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:57,510
see you as scum nowadays no but maybe

1107
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:59,970
before like maybe you know traditional

1108
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:01,050
people might think oh you never didn't

1109
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:03,870
college like you know he's that smart

1110
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:05,370
and stuff right but I'm happy that

1111
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:08,430
there's you know a lot of people in

1112
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:10,560
Japan who accepts me like of who I am

1113
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:12,690
right well you said a lot of your like

1114
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:15,240
half your fans are from Japan mm-hmm

1115
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:16,950
anything is a little bit of the graces

1116
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,870
of the media and being on terrace house

1117
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:21,450
yeah you get that exemption because it's

1118
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:23,400
like oh you didn't go to college but it

1119
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:25,380
paid off because you

1120
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:28,590
you were able to do these things well we

1121
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:32,010
had that that was my the whole subject

1122
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:34,020
of like you know what I when I was

1123
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:35,280
thinking the entire time of Aloha state

1124
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:38,010
whether or not I want to attend the

1125
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:41,520
college or not I was planning to go

1126
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:43,470
attend a music college mm-hmm and after

1127
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:47,040
you know like we seen some life tips and

1128
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:49,800
advice I talked about to everyone and

1129
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:52,950
decided on the show you said mm-hmm and

1130
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:56,010
I decided not to but you know like

1131
00:46:52,950 --> 00:47:02,490
there's no regret of whatever I have

1132
00:46:56,010 --> 00:47:04,110
done and mostly I really want to take to

1133
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:06,450
take care or lie when I really want to

1134
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:09,960
care about people who also cares about

1135
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:13,980
me mm-hmm and I think that's the most

1136
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:16,920
important thing okay sounds great

1137
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:17,310
sorry kind of got too deep no no that's

1138
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:20,520
great

1139
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:23,010
so I noticed I watched some of your

1140
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:25,890
performances and whatnot on on YouTube

1141
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:29,700
oh thanks notice that your dad is a very

1142
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:33,570
important part of your career I you know

1143
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:35,310
I met you before this podcast you know

1144
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:37,110
with your with your dad and we had a

1145
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:39,320
great conversation and it seems like

1146
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:44,550
he's very integrated into your your life

1147
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:46,500
yes he has you know in fact the music

1148
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:50,400
stuff actually came from like my parents

1149
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:53,070
to like my music interest that kind of

1150
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:56,670
makes sense see musicians or my dad used

1151
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:59,370
to be a performer he used to work for

1152
00:47:56,670 --> 00:48:03,750
NHK for 18 years he did it

1153
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:06,380
radio casting right yeah like voiceovers

1154
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:08,790
and he used to be actor too

1155
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:13,260
yeah you've done like a lot of stuff and

1156
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:15,630
you know my parents loved music they I

1157
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:18,570
think I remember like you put you play

1158
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:20,760
like some like classical classical music

1159
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:23,790
when I was like little but most likely I

1160
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:26,190
was heavily influenced by a Michael

1161
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:28,920
Jackson mm-hmm

1162
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:31,980
because I was just blown away of like

1163
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:35,490
how music could be powerful like how

1164
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:37,220
much it could influence the entire crowd

1165
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:40,079
or like you know

1166
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:43,589
the whole entirely generation like you

1167
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:46,859
know right so since then like I started

1168
00:48:43,589 --> 00:48:48,210
actually singing first before guitar I

1169
00:48:46,859 --> 00:48:50,250
knew clay but I was like stalking for

1170
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:51,869
like 4 years when I was really into

1171
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:53,609
playing the guitar so that's why during

1172
00:48:51,869 --> 00:48:57,990
terrace house and so I wrote that song

1173
00:48:53,609 --> 00:48:59,339
called monogatari one will be left or in

1174
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:01,920
the forward before I left

1175
00:48:59,339 --> 00:49:03,150
yeah okay so before that song I haven't

1176
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:07,529
sang for like four years

1177
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:11,760
mm-hmm but yeah so for my parents so

1178
00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:16,740
your your full-time musician slash actor

1179
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:19,380
would you say yes acting used to be not

1180
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:22,230
used to be acting as my another passion

1181
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:24,930
I'm passionate about I used to be a

1182
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:26,819

1189
00:49:44,279 --> 00:49:52,650
basically where you got your start then

1190
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:53,970
right well it was a while ago but after

1191
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:55,799

a professional film movie kind of style

1197
00:50:06,029 --> 00:50:12,000

1272
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:56,400

1273
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:58,079

1277
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:11,940
p.m. or something and she declined it

1278
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:14,099
like she's she told me that she can't

1279
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:17,640
make it

1280
00:54:14,099 --> 00:54:20,609
she doesn't really feel like it feels

1281
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:26,099
like it's a date so awkward

1282
00:54:20,609 --> 00:54:27,869
so I'm sorry in she hung that so Jen

1283
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:32,130
Dallas and I ended up going there by

1284
00:54:27,869 --> 00:54:36,480
myself again like three years ago and

1285
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:40,380
why did you go why did I go I love

1286
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:42,420
fireworks oh it was huge it was like it

1287
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:45,900
was in a place call me not to meet I was

1288
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:54,599
like yeah yeah it's like it was so

1289
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:57,690
beautiful and uh you know I think I

1290
00:54:54,599 --> 00:55:00,059
don't want is it avión as I say it avian

1291
00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:01,589
he and I think she's gave you good

1292
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:03,900
advice don't change I think your

1293
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:06,390
personality is very unique and I think

1294
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:08,119
it's very it's almost I mean I don't

1295
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:10,349
want to say too nice you are very nice

1296
00:55:08,119 --> 00:55:13,230
but I think it's a good thing and I

1297
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:14,819
think like she said just just hold on to

1298
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:17,339
that and wait until that right person

1299
00:55:14,819 --> 00:55:18,719
comes along that's gonna accept you as

1300
00:55:17,339 --> 00:55:20,819
because I don't think you need to be a

1301
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:27,119
bad guy the point of nice guys the song

1302
00:55:20,819 --> 00:55:29,789
wasn't about not being a nice guy finish

1303
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:31,739
last right but in the end you realize Oh

1304
00:55:29,789 --> 00:55:36,420
being a douchebag doesn't always work it

1305
00:55:31,739 --> 00:55:39,479
just works for certain people spend

1306
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:43,319
