miss summer Rae

15
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:55,739
so some for people who don't know on

16
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:58,410
Instagram you have 2.20 1.8 million

17
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,620
followers and on YouTube 1.5 million

18
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:04,860
subscribers but you were on Instagram

19
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,970
first YouTube just to kind of mess

20
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,189
around with it I did it for like six

21
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,530
months and then I stopped doing it like

22
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:12,600
just cold turkey just stopped I'm trying

23
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,610
to do it again because I feel like that

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,229
was like the most like authentic fanbase

25
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,790
ever like Instagram it's just not the

26
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,990
same so I was like I need to get back to

27
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,200
you so you actually see the difference

28
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,750
between the two yeah well like what it

29
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,450
is exactly yeah why is it more engaging

30
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,009
on YouTube than Instagram I think is

31
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,890
because like on Instagram

32
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:34,140
you just sir on there you like scroll

33
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,979
you see a picture you think of girls ha

34
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,420
blah

35
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,619
you don't like know them you don't know

36
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,390
anything about them you know on YouTube

37
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:41,369
you go on you watch someone you could be

38
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,409
in your room watch these kids are in the

39
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:45,450
room watching you for hours like they

40
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:47,460
know everything about you they're so

41
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,530
connected to you like I've had kids come

42
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,899
up to me and say things my home why do I

43
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,759
know you like it's so weird but like on

44
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,770
Instagram before I did YouTube it's not

45
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,750
like that it's just like they recognize

46
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,250
you but they don't know you and it's

47
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,469
like more of like a personal connection

48
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,939
that I like right but you did it for

49
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:05,759
like six months and you stopped is it

50
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:08,369
because you what burnout or what um I

51
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,649
don't know I just like I don't think I'm

52
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,629
a great youtuber so I don't really know

53
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,360
I don't know what to do on YouTube I'm

54
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:14,440
like

55
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,610
they want to see like cuz I would do

56
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,260
vlogs but like I had friends or

57
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,880
youtubers and it was kind of fun to like

58
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,310
just do it with them but I find myself

59
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,470
I'm like what do they want to see so now

60
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,330
I'm starting to do like more fitness

61
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:28,090

63
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,660
like like I feel like no one really

64
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,220
knows me as a part like even on my

65
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,350
youtube channel I just was like messing

66
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:38,620
around like I knew I want people to like

67
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:40,840
like get to know me as like a person

68
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,430

71
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,440

the people are able to say who cares

81
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:11,080

00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:28,269
one um like cuz I feel like I've like

90
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:30,370
really been like a big part of the

91
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:31,989
making Instagram models I have been an

92
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:34,989
Instagram model forever I'm like an OG

93
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:36,820
Instagram model but now what girls post

94
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:39,220
on Instagram I don't like to be

95
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,660
associated with it like no one has any

96
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,330
respect for themselves they post the

97
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:45,130
most raunchy things I'm just like okay I

98
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:47,440
don't like Instagram model now because

99
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:48,760
it's like no respect like obviously I

100
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,019
post pictures on my body but I have

101
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,549
respect for myself and there's certain

102
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:53,500
things that I just wants the line that

103
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:55,540
you don't cross like I don't do like new

104
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,040
like I hardly do any like implied like

105
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,900
girls are literally posting but I saw

106
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,370
this girl like her whole page she's just

107
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,600
like posting pictures of her she puts a

108
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,030
little thing over her nipples like in

109
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,860
her vagina like naked cuz I'm like I

110
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:08,019
just can't like it's like there's a fine

111
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,000
line there's like classy like I work

112
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:11,709
hard for my body I'm gonna show it off

113
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,769
because I mean I got me where I am today

114
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:16,269
and like but there's a fine line of just

115
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:18,489
like you go to their page you're like

116
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:20,380
okay this is too much like I won't want

117
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:22,539
my mom seen this was porn right yeah

118
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,400
it's like porn so a lot of things like I

119
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:25,419
think I don't like being called

120
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,250
Instagram model because there's no

121
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:29,440
respect you know it's like I deserve

122
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,580
respects you guys come on well you said

123
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,260
you that you don't want you there's some

124
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,780
things you're you wouldn't want your mom

125
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,950
to see yeah and I mean how do you feel

126
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,870
about the current stuff that you're

127
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:40,150
posting right well they are they cool

128
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,850
with it like funny because I actually

129
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:45,400
when I was a kid I'm from 16 to 18 I was

130
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:49,360
a bodybuilder like bikini so I'm in a

131
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,740
bikini on stage in my dad's my coach so

132
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,600
I literally would be posing and all this

133
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,720
kinda stuff in a tiny bikini he's my dad

134
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,220
and it's not a sexual thing like when

135
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,669
you're in that industry and stuff it's a

136
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:02,680
whole like world and it's not like it's

137
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:04,750
not gross it's not sexual it's this is

138
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,419
my body this is heart like I've sculpted

139
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:10,270
my body to look this way it's like that

140
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:12,130
it's so I've been raised in a different

141
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,960
way to view bodies like I view bodies as

142
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,669
art like I don't view it like I've never

143
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,190
even watched porn like I've never been

144
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:19,480
on I don't like I wanna watch porn

145
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,520
people are probably like a liar I'm like

146
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:28,120
no I really have never watched porn and

147
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:28,840
by accident while on Twitter I'm like oh

148
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,490
my gosh

149
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,310
but yeah I've just like been raised not

150
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,140
to think of the human body like how

151
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,090
people like think of it you know people

152
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:39,400
think of a naked body whatever like oh I

153
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,810
wanna never I wanna I think wow that

154
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,430
probably took a lot of hard work in the

155
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,930
gym like you know so it's like a

156
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,090
different way to look at it like I I

157
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:48,610
mean I saw a video I'm not sure where it

158
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,080
was from I can't remember but you said

159
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,510
something about like you really like

160
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,360
enjoy eating but that's why you work out

161
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:57,760
yeah so I think life is really short so

162
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,610
why I have those views is because I used

163
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,470
to compete 16 to 18 like a cheap meal

164
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,169
would be having a protein bar like that

165
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:06,760
is like okay like having a like Lily

166
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:09,010
your diet has to be so strict you have

167
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,660
camp any fatty or whatever and like Mike

168
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,550
I was so young and my quality of life

169
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,740
sucked like I was just like wow like

170
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:17,020
every side like I got into like an

171
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,330
eating disorder like like messed up my

172
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,830
mind with food and everything because

173
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:23,320
it's like it was really like

174
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:25,060
traumatizing and now I just moderation

175
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,440
that's my thing there's a balance like

176
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,450
I'm not just gonna eat cheeseburgers

177
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,130
every day have fun I'm gonna have a

178
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:33,640
cheeseburger and then I'm a salad it's

179
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:34,900
called balance so often though we're

180
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,580
coping you probably work out like every

181
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,870
day right yeah I try to work out every

182
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,380
day I mean I used to be really really

183
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:42,870
consistent but like I'm so busy now the

184
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:45,300
like sometimes I get off-track but yeah

185
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:47,280
I mean Ally I eat what I want but the

186
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,900
I'm also blessed with a good metabolism

187
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,020
cuz like I can really eat what I want

188
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:54,270
and I burn it off really quick but yeah

189
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,430
I think that everybody is different in

190
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:57,960
somebody some people like can't eat what

191
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,970
they want because they gain weight and

192
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,770
stuff so it's just like to eat teach

193
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:03,390
their own you know it's like everyone's

194
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,680
different but I just live my truth like

195
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:06,240

get emails that I have boxes and stuff

258
00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:16,600
they're like oh you have nothing here

259
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:19,300
I'm like hmm

260
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,620

because it got hold on I'm sure you get

262
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,100

264
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:30,189
give it to like brands and stuff I don't

265
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:32,290
just give it to like I don't know I

266
00:09:30,189 --> 00:09:34,860
don't know what they wanna say yeah well

267
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:36,519
I mean speak maybe I should do a fun uh

268
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,980
you

269
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:42,449
I mean I'm gonna just assume you have

270
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,449
some pretty crazy stories there right

271
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,000
that's a shock

272
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,860
cuz every girl we've had on here has had

273
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,910
their own story and especially for you I

274
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,889
would feel like you would have some

275
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:52,420
pretty crazy stalker stories or

276
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:53,529
something like some some really weird

277
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,449
fan experiences

278
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:59,350
yeah like sliding people weird people

279
00:09:55,449 --> 00:10:00,670
sliding in stuff like that but I think I

280
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:05,110
just don't even think about it just like

281
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:07,209
that was weird yeah it's hard I've been

282
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,769
so often it's just like I don't even

283
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:10,120
know what is weird like maybe like some

284
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:11,170
of the stories I thought girls would say

285
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,779
I'm like that's not weird that happens

286
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:16,750
to me every day yeah

287
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:18,970
are you or were you at living at the

288
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,290
cloud house mm-hmm so your current is

289
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,519
that where you're currently yet no so

290
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:23,079
that's when I lived in Hollywood I live

291
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,819
with them it's so funny because everyone

292
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:28,750
thinks it as a cloud house so actually

293
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:30,699
Brian rice is what I'm like like really

294
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,649
early good friends like when we first

295
00:10:30,699 --> 00:10:34,720
kind of started popping off on the

296
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:36,579
internet we like met up and we like just

297
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,370
really been like really good friends

298
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:41,740
since then so a few years ago like a

299
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:44,410
year ago maybe almost two yeah two years

300
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,089
ago it's crazy time flies he hit me up

301
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,709
and he was like hey I'm moving into this

302
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:48,850
house like we're looking for some

303
00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:50,949
influencers if you want to come live

304
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,240
with us and I was like I was already

305
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:54,339
living summer at the time so I just

306
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,959
couldn't but then it was weird cuz a

307
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:57,759
couple months went by and I actually

308
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:59,170
needed somewhere to live I'd even think

309
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:01,089
about it again but he called me again

310
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,889
and asked me I was like oh yeah actually

311
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:05,720
well so the time I was only him and

312
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:07,730
Ricky banks and

313
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,710
yeah I was me him and and then that's

314
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,420
before like Alyssa like started dating

315
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,100
him around that time it didn't really

316
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,750
live there were just like stay there all

317
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,430
the time and then she moved in and then

318
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,660
it like kind of formed into a class

319
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:20,150
house but everyone thinks I like moved

320
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,170
into the class house and it I had to

321
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:26,720
look up what that was

322
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:29,810
oh oh you know Brian yeah well yeah so

323
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,190
we met up before he moved out there we

324
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:34,250
need hang out a lot we played basketball

325
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,510
and stuff like that but yeah okay well

326
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,070
that's good to know I thought we were

327
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:39,170
just wondering you're like one of the

328
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:41,090
founding fathers of it than in the way

329
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:42,980
yeah no one really does anything with it

330
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:44,390
anymore like Clubhouse but I mean the

331
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,540
clock and also like the phase house you

332
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:49,820
know like phase yeah yeah but yeah those

333
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,410
are like I love them like family so I

334
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,700
just moved out because I have so much

335
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:55,490
crap that I was like I don't have enough

336
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:58,160
room for this stuff so just because just

337
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,700
because it was tweeted to us a lot

338
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,460
mm-hmm

339
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:03,830
did you and Brian ever everything it's

340
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:05,960
so funny cuz everyone thinks that yeah

341
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:07,610
but you know he needs to do it for the

342
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,560
the views he would like kind of make it

343
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:11,540
seem so he would like put in the

344
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,950
thumbnail like me and my girlfriend and

345
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,080
then in the description it would be

346
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:16,790
because she's my friend and she's a girl

347
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,380
but no one would catch that you know

348
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:20,270
right you wanted to kind of like click

349
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:22,070
bake that like we're dating we've never

350
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:23,600
had a thing we've it's like literally

354
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:35,690
I just me if people like but helps with

355
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:37,730
the views helps with the views you know

356
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,750
if some kids want to carry on the rest

357
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,370
of their life thinking that we are

358
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,920
boyfriend/girlfriend so be it but yeah

359
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:44,030
it's not true open are you about that

360
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,920
part of your life

361
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:48,050
I like relationships an Instagram I mean

362
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,340
you can show what you want to show right

363
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:53,810
yeah am I like um like I always say like

364
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,160
things I really really care about things

365
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:57,710
are the most important to me that I love

366
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,540
I like to keep private because people

367
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,940
like to get involved they like to like

368
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:03,260
kill your happiness like true so it's

369
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:06,020
like if they don't what they don't know

370
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:12,290
about they can't mingle with or like try

371
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:14,510
to kill so that's a very private and

372
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:18,050
you're you're actually uh I guess kind

373
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:19,340
of younger like you're 22 yeah how long

374
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:21,500
have you been doing this cuz you

375
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,720
kind of started pretty early in yeah

376
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,490
like four years ago like that's like

377
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,390

378
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,970

00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:20,030
always liked booty stuff is out so weird

403
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,250

405
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,000
struggle is like I don't ever I don't

00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,860
want to be like girl or whatever but

407
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,780

408
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,550
like a guys pecs in it yeah but I can't

409
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,620
step away from like what got me popular

410
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:36,590
I mean Kim got popular off a sex tape I

411
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,210
got famous off of a booty pic on

412
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:40,370
Instagram it's fine that you worked hard

413
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:43,340
for it looked hard for it okay yeah I

414
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:46,430
got these games Kay Wow issue with it I

415
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:47,840
mean I think that it's in my head cuz

416
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:50,030
you're coming in to other people right

417
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,530
yeah like I look at other girls and I'm

418
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:53,270
like I hope people don't think of me

419
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:56,060
like all right so if there's a younger

420
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:57,590
let's say someone I guess we were 17

421
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,240
when you started someone like a 17 year

422
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:01,220
old who wants to follow that path what

423
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:05,030
would you say to them I would say just

424
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:07,430
like stay - oh my my advice is like see

425
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:09,800
authentic to you so that really is your

426
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:11,390
goal and you literally love working out

427
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,280
and you really like like if that's what

428
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:15,350
you love and you're not doing it because

429
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,090
you saw someone do it and got popular

430
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:19,100
off of it but it's because you want to

431
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:20,510
do it because when I did it I didn't see

432
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,340
anyone do it and be like oh I want to

433
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:24,110
copy that and follow that and do it I

434
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:26,330
didn't know what it was gonna be I was

435
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:28,760
just doing what I love and posting it on

436
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:31,070
the Internet posting my pictures of

437
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,790
working out and stuff and it turned into

438
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,990
this so it wasn't like I saw someone

439
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:36,630
and I was like I'm gonna do that you

440
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:38,940
know so it's like I think the real like

441
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:41,700
pioneers in life are the originators who

442
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,780
like create and like try it like do

443
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,930
something that you're really passionate

444
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:47,820
about that is new and like original and

445
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:49,950
that's how you succeed so I agree with

446
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,960
that totally like I think the only way

447
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:54,320
to become as because you have on

448
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:56,670
Instagram is like you just said

449
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,160
originators ten years you did your own

450
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:00,300
thing you didn't really imitate others

451
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,340
yeah they're people on the platform

452
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,650
that's my thing my whole messaging is

453
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,270
like be you and it's like because I

454
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:07,980
always see girls always like copying

455
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:09,930
everyone copying me and it's not

456
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,550
anything like I just feel bad for them

457
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:13,860
because it's like I just want them to

458
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:15,600
like find themselves and like just

459
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,400
embrace who they are because if you're

460
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,570
always gonna be copying people you're

461
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,040
always gonna change you're never gonna

462
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,660
know who you are because that girl that

463
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,250
you're obsessing over right now

464
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,200
might change next year you're gonna be

465
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,760
another girl it's like it's like be you

466
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,130
like you can find inspiration like

467
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:31,020
obviously what I have done and graded

468
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,640
it's not like I'm the only one who can

469
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:34,530
do it it's just like put your own twist

470
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:38,150
on it do different things like don't

471
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:40,320
copy like you can find inspiration but

472
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:42,690
it's different you know when you say

473
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,640
people copying you what exactly do you

474
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:48,180
what can you like specify on like what

475
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:50,640
specific thing it's not really copying

476
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,990
or whatever but you know like I I was

477
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,250
one of the first like girls on the

478
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:56,280
internet who posted pictures of her body

479
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:57,630
on Instagram you know and I like there

480
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,160
was other girls doing it like booty pics

481
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,080
and stuff but I took it to the next

482
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,000
level okay and I like started posting

483
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,830
like booty videos like bounce around my

484
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,750
buttons up and like no one did videos

485
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:09,030
and then I did so it's now it's like you

486
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:11,100
go to any girls video page just trying

487
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:13,230
to be a booty model they have like the

488
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,060
pictures the videos and seven the thing

489
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:17,010
is it's hard to get like really popular

490
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,930
off doing that now cuz its oversaturated

491
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:21,120
like everyone's trying to do it so I was

492
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:22,980
like one of the first so it's like that

493
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,590
but it's not really copying it's like

494
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,120
every everyone copies everyone that is

495
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,520
the thing of life it's like no you have

496
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,200
to learn it from somewhere you have to

497
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,430
agree so I start copying me it's just I

498
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,590
know where they're finding their

499
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:36,330
inspiration but you start noting that I

500
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,310
said and I find it interesting you start

501
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:39,960
if you said body building right so and

502
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,500
your dad was your coach I'm assuming

503
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,930
he's jacked

504
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,640
oh yeah so yeah he's body building is

505
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:46,270
that because you grew up on a branch

506
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,920
you said I mean I grew up on

507
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:49,810
branch but before I was even born he was

508
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,520
like a bodybuilder that's like what he

509
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:53,590
did and they got married then he kind of

510
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,490
got out of it but my mom and him got

511
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,900
divorced and then he started

512
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,940
bodybuilding again but yeah I've grew

513
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,500
I've worked out my whole life we had a

514
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,240
gym in the basement in my house growing

515
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,730
up I was a daddy's girl I was always

516
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,710
with him always working out yeah so

517
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:08,500
working on just in my blood it's like

518
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:10,480
what I love so it's like if girls want

519
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:13,060
that to be their lifestyle then live it

520
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,710
and if you come back successful off of

521
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:18,070
it that's amazing and your method is

522
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:22,210
work out so that you can still eat not

523
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:22,780
starve I work I just work out what I

524
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:25,690
want

525
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:28,120
moderation balance and yeah a lot of

526
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:29,680
girls like they think like not eating is

527
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,820
gonna get the like so many people always

528
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,260

00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,990

530
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:37,270

body will like store it as fat you guys

537
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,000
starvation mode so you're not not ever

538
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,290
gonna eat these girls who are starving

539
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,400
themselves for like five days then

540
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:59,110
they're just gonna go and eat a ton

541
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,670
because you're starving and then your

542
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:04,060
body's gonna store as fat so my advice

543
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:06,070
five small meals a day like are you

544
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,660
still so that that does work for you

545
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:09,160
then yeah it does work for everyone

546
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,750
some things work for other people but

547
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,310
that's like what I look for me

548
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,630
I don't think starving works for anyone

549
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:15,190
yeah you're gonna lose weight but right

550
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:17,050
it's not the right type of weight you

551
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,610
know because it's not healthy it's more

552
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:22,500
what am i and how do you feel about like

553
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:22,500
intermittent fasting I think it about

554
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:29,470
fasting fasting no like it is good if

555
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:33,060
you really intermediate that's what

556
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:33,060
that's called right yeah close enough

557
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:40,930
yeah it's good if you really have a good

558
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,070
schedule and you know exactly what

559
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,240
you're doing a lot of people are doing

560
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:45,370
it and they think that they know what

561
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,710
we're doing and like what do you have no

562
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:49,390
idea like it's all times and like a

563
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:51,520
certain amount of time not to eat to eat

564
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:53,020
they just hear someone's time so like oh

565
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,790
I'm gonna do that too right I'm like pay

566
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,500
but that's not matching your lifestyle

567
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:58,840
like you have to like plan it out for

568
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,800
you like in The Times and everything so

569
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,120
you have to actually like

570
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,950
knowledgeable about it before you do it

571
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,360
so many so many fads like oh I'm gonna

572
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:06,190
do that so once I was doing it it's like

573
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:09,610
okay but you have to like sculpt it to

574
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:11,500
your your day not always fun like those

575
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:13,000
diets I mean the fads they work right to

576
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,190
a certain degree I think if you do it

577
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,290
that the problem is for a lot of people

578
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:19,180
they don't necessarily have your mindset

579
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:21,610
of having two how would you how would

580
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:23,290
you say that you created this to be your

581
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:25,120
lifestyle because that seems to be the

582
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:26,470
key because you want to work out a lot

583
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,330
of people don't want that's the thing I

584
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:30,160
I make it a lifestyle you know some

585
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:32,380
people they're like I'm gonna go to the

586
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,850
gym and that's like a thing that I'm

587
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,650
gonna dread and I'm just gonna do it

588
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:37,420
because I have to do it like I have to

589
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:39,070
go to the gym me I'm like I'm gonna go

590
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:41,080
to the gym that's a part of my life it's

591
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:42,820
a part of my day I'm excited to go like

592
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,230
me and my mama boys made go in the gym

593
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,030
like the highlight of her day like the

594
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:47,740
fun part like we didn't go to the gym

595
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:49,630
and I gotta go to the gym got hard work

596
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,400
me and mom hang out there for hours we

597
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:53,620
have millions of friends really having

598
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:58,030
the best time like I think it's just all

599
00:20:53,620 --> 00:21:00,370
I'm like like how I just find shame it's

600
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:01,990
right I mean I think everyone has like

601
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:03,310
if you've ever liked your past

602
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,780
experience is like if you're gonna go at

603
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:06,160
Disneyland you're gonna have the worst

604
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,030
time ever you're not gonna always think

605
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,860
back you make oh my god I love

606
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:10,300

607
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,620
of all the great times I've had working

608
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,310

611
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,830
moment you make it a job it's a job so

612
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,380
I've never made working out a job it's

613
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:21,550
just a fun I'm sure but I'm sure there

614
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,900

days where I'm even like a bad mood I'm

622
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,710
I'm down on myself like with things like

623
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,690
that people don't understand it's like

624
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:45,490
everyone's human I have days where I

625
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:48,430

I fight there like how I find my

640
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:19,659
motivation is like I don't look for

641
00:22:17,649 --> 00:22:21,219
motivation like oh I want to get in

642
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:22,119
shape for this pool-party or I want to

643
00:22:21,219 --> 00:22:23,769
get in shape because I'm going on

644
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:25,269
vacation like coz right when that is

645
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:26,349
over you're gonna forget about working

646
00:22:25,269 --> 00:22:27,729
out and you don't care about working out

647
00:22:26,349 --> 00:22:31,539
anymore you have to do it for like a

648
00:22:27,729 --> 00:22:34,539
real reason that's not going to go away

649
00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:36,129
you know and it seems like a you know

650
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:37,989
the whole thing with like nature versus

651
00:22:36,129 --> 00:22:39,489
nurture where like this how you

652
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:42,399
naturally are this is how you're raised

653
00:22:39,489 --> 00:22:43,959
it seems like a lot of things that are

654
00:22:42,399 --> 00:22:45,489
very positive about you is because of

655
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:46,869
your how we were raised

656
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,429
yeah your upbringing and a lot of things

657
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:49,929
that you credit so you know being with

658
00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:51,700
your dad he was constantly working out

659
00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:54,999
so you were you saw that work ethic you

660
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:57,339
know that was built into you and just

661
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:59,889
the positivity in your mindset and how

662
00:22:57,339 --> 00:23:01,539
you view things optimistically it's

663
00:22:59,889 --> 00:23:03,669
almost like all of that together is

664
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:07,659
built up a lot of your brand so you went

665
00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:09,219
from like og IG model and to become kind

666
00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:11,829
of like a role model now and you're

667
00:23:09,219 --> 00:23:13,749
turning that into that aspect so I'm

668
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:15,609
just curious it's like what is your

669
00:23:13,749 --> 00:23:17,079
future because we're discussing a lot

670
00:23:15,609 --> 00:23:19,149
about your past right now but like what

671
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:22,539
are the future steps for you a future I

672
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:25,299
just want to UM like I feel like in the

673
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:27,489
world today like there's no like really

674
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:29,109
really amazing like role models or

675
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,669
models or anyone that little girls can

676
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:32,619
look up to that are all natural just

677
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:35,469
embrace themselves have their big bushy

678
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:37,359
eyebrows natural everything and never

679
00:23:35,469 --> 00:23:39,249
gone like any surgeries done or anything

680
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:40,599
and like no offense of people who do get

681
00:23:39,249 --> 00:23:42,190
surgeries but I think that there should

682
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:44,409
be someone in the world for girls to

683
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:46,329
look up to and be like that's my role

684
00:23:44,409 --> 00:23:47,919
model you know and there's just no one

685
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:49,329
in the world right now really like that

686
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,839
so I want to be that role model for

687
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:54,369
girls I want to teach them to love their

688
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:57,009
natural selves and they don't have to

689
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:59,769
change anything to be like perfect or

690
00:23:57,009 --> 00:24:00,879
fit into society because how boring

691
00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:02,259
would it be a world that we all look the

692
00:24:00,879 --> 00:24:04,570
same because with surgeries people start

693
00:24:02,259 --> 00:24:07,929
looking the same it's not fun anymore

694
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:09,489
like surgery is also unhealthy like very

695
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:11,409
dangerous to go under the knife just for

696
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:14,229
your looks and stuff so it's like I want

697
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:15,579
to teach girls that there is no standard

698
00:24:14,229 --> 00:24:17,320
of beauty you're beautiful because

699
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:19,209
that's how you look and you're beautiful

700
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,529
the way you are look I understand when

701
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:22,239
girls like are born they have like

702
00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:23,529
really big noses and they don't feel

703
00:24:22,239 --> 00:24:25,659
confident they you really need get that

704
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:27,010
but people take it a little overboard

705
00:24:25,659 --> 00:24:29,200
and they have already butyl

706
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:31,510
features and then they ruin them you

707
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,100
know and now it's like oh well you were

708
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,840
so beautiful before why'd you do that to

709
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,309
yourself so I want to be like a really

710
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,500
good role model for girls and I just

711
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:40,630
want to be like a mogul you know like

712
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:43,059
you know those people that are like so

713
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:44,500
big and you're like how are they in this

714
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:46,179

725
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,850
just mentioned like oh my I mean that

726
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:17,230
you want to be I would I would probably

727
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:18,610
wanna be I've never had like I've never

728
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:21,580
gone to an acting coach or never done

729
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:22,960
anything so it's like I think um if I

730
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:24,100
give a shine I love it but it's one of

731
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,049
those things I like to do things I love

732
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,400
so if I did it I hated it I just won't

733
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:29,500
pursue it because it's not something I

734
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,330
love but if I did it I loved it I want

735
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:33,040
to pursue it because I I don't want to

736
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,570
do anything that feels like work and

737
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,790
it's not not fun like I think everything

738
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:37,780
should be fun and like do stuff there's

739
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:41,140
so many things you can do in the world

740
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:43,530
do something you love you know so okay

741
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:48,040

764
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:47,050
the honey honey mustard

765
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:49,360
and my two favorite sauces all-time [ __ ]

766
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:50,800
about like well I it was in an interview

767
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,390
as well where you said you will go to

768
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,370
chick-fil-a and do that kind of stuff

769
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:56,350
and go there and just eat or whatever do

770
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:58,360
you get any like pushback from that

771
00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:01,330
Oh like I mean you know there's a stigma

772
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:03,700
of like Oh chick-fil-a supporters don't

773
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:06,160
support gay people Oh

774
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,780
I mean he's gotten pushback for his love

775
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:10,780
for chick-fil-a I see you know what I

776
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:12,700
think though this is my approach we

777
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:14,530
don't know the company the people who

778
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:16,510
created this microphone company they

779
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:19,780
could be supporting terrorism they could

780
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:23,410
be supporting animal cruelty we don't

781
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:26,440
know these things and you know when I

782
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:27,520
when I go to chick-fil-a I I go to the

783
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,340
one in Hollywood

784
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:34,000
I see the gay community eating there too

785
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:35,590
so I'm like you know what I'm gonna eat

786
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,130
here too because they have good service

787
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:42,280
and their sauces are good their

788
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:43,930
sandwiches are good mm-hm and well the

789
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,990
thing is if you're receiving that kind

790
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:49,450
of pushback and you have you know 20

791
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:52,150
almost 22 million followers and I'm

792
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:54,970
assuming you're gonna see even more of a

793
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:56,440
pushback and the thing with that is

794
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:58,990
weird because I've gone a chick-fil-a

795
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,970
countless times and had gay people like

796
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:02,890
working for me like working there so I'm

797
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:06,180
like where is this info coming from like

798
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:09,220
where the real facts at chick-fil-a do

799
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:10,360
those real facts because then they need

800
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,160
to go and fire all the gay people

801
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,930
working for them so I've see it so I

802
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,060
don't know I don't believe stuff that

803
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:18,010
the media like I need to see real facts

804
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:19,240
coming from so I don't believe that so

805
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:20,860
people said that I'd be like where's

806
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,270
your proof that's good I mean you're bit

807
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,770
like it like you said and you want to be

808
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:25,660
genuine right so how do you feel about

809
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:27,940
like censoring yourself when it comes to

810
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:29,230
like you know the whole cancel culture

811
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,270
thing right like being yourself do you

812
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:32,980
how much do you worry about what you're

813
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:34,600
saying is being offensive to someone or

814
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:37,060
you know you might want to hold back

815
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:39,910
because you don't want to get cancelled

816
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:41,710
yeah I don't know I feel like I don't

817
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:43,480
really talk I don't talk politics and I

818
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:45,280
don't talk any of that kind of stuff so

819
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,170
I mean if people are just offended with

820
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:49,720
me just being mic you don't care bubbly

821
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:51,610
self like who I am as a person I don't

822
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,660
care I don't really talk about it I

823
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,700
don't want to get into that because

824
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,049
everyone

825
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,000
their own opinion you're never gonna be

826
00:28:55,049 --> 00:28:59,070
able to please everybody I care about my

827
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,090
opinion it's my secret thoughts and no

828
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:03,299
one needs to know about it except my

829
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:06,120
family so you're very wise for your age

830
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:07,260
for your age yeah I have to say your

831
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,450

lot older than you are they kind of

838
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:24,480
surprised at how you carry yourself it's

839
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,279
funny because my my only friend cuz I

school like to do like a cetacean so I

854
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,840
was in school like before I dropped out

855
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:58,110
I wasn't ever a school I I just would

856
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:00,570
never go go to schools my mom and I'm

857
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:03,389
from I was every single friend was her

858
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:05,039
friend my friend like I was best friend

859
00:30:03,389 --> 00:30:07,409

860
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:10,559
older my best friend other than my mom

861
00:30:07,409 --> 00:30:12,210
is 35 so I always have gotten along with

862
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,130
older women I don't know why I never can

863
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:15,570
relate to girls my age those want to do

864
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:18,149
things I don't want to do they talk

865
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:20,159
about things I'm like and then older

866
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:21,840
women I can relate to them we're best

867
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,600
friends like they I feel like they don't

868
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:26,340
even think cuz when I was like 17 I met

869
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,690
my best friend and she's 10 years older

870
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,700
than me and she's like she's sometimes

871
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:32,549
like think like wow you're only 7 I

872
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:34,889
could like mine blow her like like you

873
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:36,419
how are you this young because you're

874
00:30:34,889 --> 00:30:38,610
more mature than most of my friends that

875
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:40,350
are my age so I think it's just I think

876
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:41,639
some people are just old souls right

877
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:43,740
that's me I don't want to look back

878
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:45,570
though I'm like in my 40s I'm like [ __ ]

879
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:47,730
I wish I woulda live my you're 16 I do

880
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:49,320

I'm really a homebody I don't like to go

882
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,519
to the club like I'm like I don't want

883
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:55,080
to regret not having fun but to me it's

884
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,960
not fun like you know how I'm having fun

885
00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:02,929

00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:14,830
lot of saliva okay well that's good

890

that's an old person trait yeah no no no

891
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:18,310
that is it guys you guys are probably

892
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:20,290
like let's never have summer on this

893
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:22,510

very entertaining don't worry we'll wipe

896
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:30,760
it down with that being said we would

897
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:49,270
take a quick cheesy break and we'll be

898
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:53,920
right back okay what's up I have a

899
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:55,930
question can I go ahead okay okay so I

900
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:58,930
have a question here so you make a lot

901
00:31:55,930 --> 00:32:02,050
of references to Scripture I mean you

902
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:06,700
mentioned that you you're Christian did

903
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:09,130
you did you grow up in a Christian give

904
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:11,050
myself like I don't like say I'm

905
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:12,490
Christian or anything just because I

906
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:14,770
like Christians not like a bad rap

907
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:16,510
sometimes really really judgmental like

908
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:18,760
some people think of it's like this

909
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:21,490
Sigma about it like I just say I have a

910
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,870
relationship with my Lord and I love

911
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:24,550
Jesus and I have my own walk with him

912
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:25,570
and that's what it is see but don't you

913
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:27,340
think that's kind of sad that you have

914
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:33,250
to say that though like that you're have

915
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:35,290
to be afraid but I think that I've come

916
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:37,060
across a lot of Christians that are very

917
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:39,640
judgmental that make me don't want to

918
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:43,150
associate with them similar to the IG

919
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:44,290
models well because the thing I am

920
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:46,840
Christian like if we were gonna say a

921
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:48,730
religion but I just feel like there's so

922
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,830
many judgmental Christians and they do

923
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:52,390
like the trying to like make you feel

924
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:54,220
like a horrible person like we're all

925
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:56,110
sinners and we're all like we can't be

926
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:58,240
perfect that's why we have Jesus you

927
00:32:56,110 --> 00:33:00,400
know so I feel like some people try to

928
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,680
like say things make it's just like not

929
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:05,350
good enough it's because they make their

930
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:07,210
own agenda with their spewing their

931
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:09,100
words in their own way use the scripture

932
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:11,590
to like make you and it's just not cool

933
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:13,810
like if you live God God is loving and

934
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:16,540
in all this good stuff is the true

935
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:17,250
message of Christianity is to love one

936
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,559
another

937
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:21,929
yeah they're like hypocrites I hate they

938
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:23,190
don't they're like hating and it also

939
00:33:21,929 --> 00:33:24,990
we're not supposed to judge other people

940
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:25,919
and they're literally judging every

941
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:27,539
single thing and saying that you're

942
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:31,350
going to help you know that's not me and

943
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:33,480
that's not like what I preach so did you

944
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:36,210
grow up in it or did or was it something

945
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:38,520
you discovered later on and were friends

946
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:39,720
I grew up with it yeah but I'm not one

947
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,919
of those people like oh just cuz I grew

948
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,659
up it is what I believe like I've done

949
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:44,159
my own research my own stuff

950
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:45,630
I'm not she's gonna believe and do what

951
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:52,049
my parents say like I do it for myself

952
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:55,530
so yeah I love have you I mean when did

953
00:33:52,049 --> 00:33:58,559
you move out here um three years ago now

954
00:33:55,530 --> 00:34:00,600
yeah I would actually come out here for

955
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,980
a month like an air B&B and then go home

956
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,600
from us cuz I just didn't really want to

957
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:05,309
live fully out here because like I just

958
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,750
heard crazy stories about the people out

959
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:07,950
here and like even just be down here for

960
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,869
a month it's just like hard to know

961
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:10,859
who's real and who's true and who's like

962
00:34:09,869 --> 00:34:12,990
you know I just don't want to get Rick

963
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:14,790
wrapped up in the wrong things but now I

964
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:16,349
live here and I think I'm just morally

965
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:19,109
very straight so I don't get caught up

966
00:34:16,349 --> 00:34:21,349
in the wrong things so have you uh not

967
00:34:19,109 --> 00:34:24,210

00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:52,830

other everything I want to be so close

986
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:00,570
like girls don't want to be like that

987
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,010
with me like they have their other

988
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:03,420
friend and then they don't invite me and

989
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:04,980
they don't want to really be friends I'm

990
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:07,740
like they want to be friends but they

991
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:08,849
don't want to be friends so that's why I

992
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:10,470
don't really I'm not friends with like

993
00:35:08,849 --> 00:35:12,720
other like influencer girls or anything

994
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:14,070
a lot I'm just like friends with like

995
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,599
girls who are like normal because they

996
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:17,130
actually want to be my friend like I

997
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,540
don't like fake [ __ ] like I'm not gonna

998
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:19,060
free friends with you on the internet

999
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,040
and then

1000
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:23,880
friends outside the inner you know I

1001
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:26,170
want to actually meet friends right oh

1002
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,480
it sounds like I mean it seemed that we

1003
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:29,950
the reason I ask is because it does seem

1004
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,270
like you have this mindset of someone

1005
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:32,650
who is from like a small town or

1006
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:39,610
something and you said you grew up on a

1007
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:40,690
ranch in Colorado yeah yeah and I was

1008
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:43,180
just curious is how long you've been

1009
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:45,790
here because I mean I grew up in a small

1010
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:48,250
town in Hawaii and when I moved here I

1011
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:50,560
found probably the same things I was it

1012
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:51,940
kind of shocked and not prepared for the

1013
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,260
people that live here I'm not saying

1014
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:55,720
that all the people here are like that

1015
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:59,830
but there's a lot of um on how to

1016
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:00,850
describe it just manipulation I guess

1017
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:02,680
and the thing if you think about

1018
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:03,880
everyone here has a reason to be here

1019
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,610
and they are trying to break cessful

1020
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:08,950
mm-hmm so you're a target yeah and

1021
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:10,480
people's tactics to getting famous are

1022
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:12,220
getting to where their success is like

1023
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,810
stepping on people to get there you know

1024
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:15,670
and if you're not that type of person

1025
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:17,290
you can get stepped on very easy exactly

1026
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:19,180
so you just have to kind of be mindful

1027
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:20,980
of those type people not everyone's like

1028
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:23,110
that like I know there are people who

1029
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:24,670
love people and want to because you can

1030
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:26,170
get successful and you can collab with

1031
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:28,180
people and you can do things you know

1032
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:29,260
loving way and uplift each other not hey

1033
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:31,600
I'm gonna step on you to get to where

1034
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:33,760
I'm going right but it's as more people

1035
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,800
are very insecure in themselves that

1036
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,120
they don't feel that's possible because

1037
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,400
it's like oh this this relationship

1038
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:41,110
couldn't be authentic because I can't

1039
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,490
fathom having one like that right so

1040
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:43,660
they're so used to just taking an

1041
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:44,860
advantage of others because they're

1042
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,900
afraid of being taken advantage of

1043
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,950
themselves yeah but do you find it

1044
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:50,710
that's one of the reasons why you're

1045
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:52,060
more of a homebody as well yeah I don't

1046
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:54,430
know everyone just wants to go out and

1047
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:56,050
LA like the clubs I'm like you you

1048
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:58,150
there's nothing worse in life than

1049
00:36:56,050 --> 00:37:00,430
standing at this dirty couch with a

1050
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:01,720

00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:32,640
couch sometimes I'm like and I'm not

1068
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:34,260
like a crazy partier I'm just kind

1069
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,910
chillin there I'm like I don't want to

1070
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,349
be here but if it was like a dance floor

1071
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:39,420
and we had a room and we could actually

1072
00:37:37,349 --> 00:37:40,950
like drink and have fun and like the

1073
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:43,559
answers I mean it'd be a lot more fun I

1074
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:46,650
just don't really like the couches and

1075
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:49,589
the vibe like I mean I have to be really

1076
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:55,680
drunk to go to club it kind of sound

1077
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:58,349
like Ryan a little bit surprised right

1078
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,339
now I don't like those couches either -

1079
00:37:58,349 --> 00:38:03,029
the dancing part

1080
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:05,960
you would actually dance well sir when

1081
00:38:03,029 --> 00:38:08,760
I'm sober

1082
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,710
okay I've seen I'm drunk I'm like okay

1083
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,200
because I all cares got the world like

1084
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:14,760
I'm friends with everyone like that's

1085
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,240
probably a little intense like when I'm

1086
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,519
drunk

1087
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,049
I go up to every single person I'm like

1088
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:21,569
hi my name is summer and I give him a

1089
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:23,760
hug like I wake up the next day and I

1090
00:38:21,569 --> 00:38:25,230
like hope to God like that was a dream

1091
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:29,549
because it's like I'm overly friendly

1092
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:32,069
where it's like but I mean I can't be

1093
00:38:29,549 --> 00:38:33,269
that's just like my inner self is very

1094
00:38:32,069 --> 00:38:35,099
friendly and I want to be friends with

1095
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:36,359
everyone so it comes out and then I'm

1096
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:38,640
like but you have to be careful because

1097
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:40,200
people are mean no they'll take that on

1098
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,940
in a completely different way yeah

1099
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:45,990
oh guys probably do take it a different

1100
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:47,160
way even girls too because they're like

1101
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,809
oh why is she so friendly what does she

1102
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,579
want

1103
00:38:47,809 --> 00:38:51,480
yeah it's just a different which is why

1104
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:55,890
I was saying it's a little different

1105
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:58,079
here sure like you everyone's on like

1106
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:59,940
the lookout for like everything so even

1107
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,619
if someone's not even being like that

1108
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,970
you you could think every little

1109
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:04,980
movement that they're doing it could be

1110
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:07,289
like that because we're on the lookout

1111
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:10,200
for someone to mess up like [ __ ] us over

1112
00:39:07,289 --> 00:39:12,509
something so yeah so it's a well it's a

1113
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:18,869
real weird place in Vegas you guys go

1114
00:39:12,509 --> 00:39:20,339
out a lot no no no no we don't we don't

1115
00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:21,779
go I mean when the reason I moved to

1116
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:23,700
Vegas I lived here for like a year and a

1117
00:39:21,779 --> 00:39:24,450
half and then I just wasn't a fan so I

1118
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,339
moved back to it

1119
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:29,910
well Vegas is close enough to LA we're

1120
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:32,039
like an hour flight and and surprisingly

1121
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:33,089
it's it's super chill it's not the strip

1122
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:35,099
if that's what you're thinking

1123
00:39:33,089 --> 00:39:36,900
yeah yeah yeah people it's just like

1124
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:38,250
anything people think like Oh Vegas I

1125
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,599
think that you're on the strip every day

1126
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:44,550
we're walking around with one of those

1127
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:47,190
big like icy looking yeah

1128
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:48,150
walking around I'm like that's Vegas

1129
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:49,230
yeah

1130
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:52,020
no you're probably something like a

1131
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:55,020
little suburban house like chillin far

1132
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:56,340
far from the strip yeah yeah my head

1133
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:59,670
goes to the strip I think you guys are

1134
00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:00,390
just like I didn't know people go

1135
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:02,820
clubbing here

1136
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:04,290

1137
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,620
another really good friend I have out

1138
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:06,720
here

1139
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:08,610
she's like a clothing designer and she

1140
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,500
like has these clothes like she writes

1141
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:12,900
on jackets like pants on jackets and she

1142
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,760
has this one that says loss and bottle

1143
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:17,580
service killed Los Angeles and it's so

1144
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:19,950
true like bottle service killed Lawson

1145
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:20,850
oh you mean the like the couches and

1146
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:24,150
stuff that's what you're talking about

1147
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:25,980
the couch is yeah oh yes because back in

1148
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:28,260
the day like my momma tell me there's no

1149
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,670
bottle service there's a VIP room and

1150
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,110
then there and there's bars you just go

1151
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:33,090
buy your own stuff but this bottle

1152
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:34,710
service comes and you need a couch and a

1153
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:36,300
table for the bottle service and that's

1154
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:37,470
how you get alcohol and stuff I mean

1155
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,140
there's still bar but it's a whole

1156
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:42,150
different vibe now I should have been

1157
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:44,580
born in a different time baby

1158
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:46,650
I always say I want I wish I was a

1159
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:48,540
teenager with my mom that sounds weird

1160
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:50,340
right you're like I couldn't none of you

1161
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:53,700
see her as your best friend yeah I was

1162
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:56,190
about the same age in the 80s we would

1163
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,990
tear [ __ ] she had the same kind of

1164
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:59,370
energy as you oh yeah I mean she's a

1165
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:01,800
little bit more laid-back I'm a little

1166
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:03,870
bit more crazy but no she's like them so

1167
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,700
what your dad is cool is mom and my my

1168
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:07,290
me and my dad are so alike like he's

1169
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:09,390
actually a lot like me he's a lot higher

1170
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:11,280
energy it's kind of crazy that's me I

1171
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:13,650
think that's why you guys I think you

1172
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,110
naturally have a lot of energy and I

1173
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:17,970
think that also aids your workout

1174
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:19,650
schedule yeah oh I feel like that's why

1175
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:22,010
you love doing it cuz you have to exert

1176
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:27,480
oh what would happen to me just chilling

1177
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:30,570
yeah you just explode I have really dude

1178
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,610
I really like I'm I like I'm very

1179
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:34,200
short-fused sometimes and when I'm not

1180
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:35,820
working out I'm like I just freak out

1181
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,050
but then I'm like fine two seconds later

1182
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,700
and I forget that I haven't freaked out

1183
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:41,430
everyone's like I can't like I did

1184
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:43,350
something I'm like what I think that's

1185
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:44,730
why you are the way you are I think you

1186
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:46,350
have so much and you said your

1187
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:48,900
metabolism is high you just have so much

1188
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:52,230
energy you have to do something with not

1189
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:55,890
here can expose a hospital speaking of

1190
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:58,500
exerting energy I saw I saw one of your

1191
00:41:55,890 --> 00:42:00,030
recent videos what

1192
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,040
I saw one of your recent YouTube videos

1193
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:09,240
that you were in the challenger games

1194
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:11,130
then the Paul brothers put on your super

1195
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:13,020
athletic I saw you running on that track

1196
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:15,119
pissed off about this because the girl

1197
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:18,210
who won has a scholarship in track you

1198
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:21,480
can't be here that's like playing like

1199
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:27,900
um tag football whatever with LeBron I

1200
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:29,520
don't know does he play football that's

1201
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:32,160
like playing a game of like basketball

1202
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,900
like pickup out with LeBron James like

1203
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:37,890
that's not fair yeah like if you have a

1204
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:40,680
scholarship who's a girl charity yes I

1205
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:41,849
can place then or well okay so the gun

1206
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,079
went off word I've said this so many

1207
00:42:41,849 --> 00:42:45,630
times people are gonna be like what the

1208
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:47,069
hell summer we get it so everyone's like

1209
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:48,510
I thought like they said I don't have

1210
00:42:47,069 --> 00:42:50,310
never run track before mhm

1211
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:51,990
I did it like before I dropped out I

1212
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:53,819
like did just a few practices but I

1213
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:55,500
never like I dropped out of school so I

1214
00:42:53,819 --> 00:42:58,410
got a min like finish track or whatever

1215
00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:00,089
but I guess they're not supposed to say

1216
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:01,260
2 3 1 or 1 2 3

1217
00:43:00,089 --> 00:43:02,760
and just like iron shop but I thought

1218
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:04,859
they were gonna say like 1 2 3 anything

1219
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,480
guy there gunshot went off and everyone

1220
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:08,280
win then I was like and then I went so

1221
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,220
if you would like watch the think clip I

1222
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:13,440
don't go right away so and the start is

1223
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:15,839
everything so if you don't go when

1224
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,490
another girl who won she's like a track

1225
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,510
person so she did the blocks and

1226
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:20,160
everything I don't know how to use a

1227
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:22,290
block so it was just wasn't fair I

1228
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,760
probably could have won if I left that

1229
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:27,990
girl wasn't in it like we're not

1230
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:30,900
supposed to be here and then and then um

1231
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:32,700
yeah and then if I had a good start

1232
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,079
because I caught up with everyone except

1233
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:36,930
her cuz she's like really fast you were

1234
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:39,000
second third because I really had a bad

1235
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:41,910
start if you watch it I literally go

1236
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,950
like 4 or 5 like it's a lot it's a

1237
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:47,220
little thought when you're like on the

1238
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:50,310
race that's kind of similar with the

1239
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:51,180
guys too cuz Toby was second but the guy

1240
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:53,190
who got first

1241
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:54,480
he's like an actual sprinter or an

1242
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:55,859
athlete or something like that

1243
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,970

just gonna say

1247
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:07,490
like I'm very but I think that's why I

1248
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:09,140
can be sick like I'm in just a go-getter

1249
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:10,910
and like if I put my mind to something

1250
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:15,110
if I want something I work hard for it

1251
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:16,670

1252
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:18,770
scholarship in track if she's an

1253
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:20,840

1294
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:00,830
up riding horses and stuff so I mean I

1295
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:03,260
haven't ridden in a while but that's

1296
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:05,630
like riding a bike like I always know

1297
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:07,910
how to ride a horse that's like my like

1298
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:11,119
foundation of life you know you go back

1299
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:12,380
a lot um I was just back like around the

1300
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,910
time of the Challenger Games wherever I

1301
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:16,310
was in Colorado and then I came back

1302
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:16,730
early for it and yeah so that's the

1303
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:17,930
first time

1304
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:19,760
I've been home in like a year so I don't

1305
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:22,040
really go back too often I just feel

1306
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,690
like when I go home I'm like I like see

1307
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:25,010
my family and everything is like great

1308
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:26,720
when I'm seeing them and then I see them

1309
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:28,550
all and I'm like why am I here there's

1310
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,870
just nothing to do like I need to go and

1311
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:31,400
then I almost get depressed because I'm

1312
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:33,830
like there's so much stuff I should be

1313
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:36,740
doing like for work and stuff so that's

1314
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:39,860
crazy so it's so similar to what I do

1315
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:42,950
yeah backgrounds yeah but when I was at

1316
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:45,380
that age - that's like riding horses I'm

1317
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:46,820
not writing for going home into a small

1318
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:49,400
town where it's literally nothing

1319
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:50,930
there's nothing to do they don't live in

1320
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:53,750
the small town like Larkspur anymore but

1321
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:55,370
hmm it's a suburb like Denver and like

1322
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:57,650
they live in the outskirts at Denver and

1323
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:59,240
it's pretty it's just not the same as

1324
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:01,430
here it's not fast paced like it's not

1325
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:04,970
like it's tough to do like it's just

1326
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:07,190
kind of like yeah okay like I just like

1327
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:09,320
to do I like to I'm like a go-go type

1328
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:11,720

1329
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:13,760

1330
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,620

everything into this platform that we

1387
00:49:10,819 --> 00:49:14,510
don't own like at the end of a I don't

1388
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:15,829
own those followers and stuff so if they

1389
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:17,720

1390
00:49:15,829 --> 00:49:20,059

00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:22,369
own IP in like my own like businesses

1392
00:49:20,059 --> 00:49:23,690

another line has nothing to do with me

1419
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:15,140

1420
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:17,000
it's cute clothes right that's all it is

1421
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:18,230

mine so yeah I'm just like focus and I'm

1424
00:50:22,849 --> 00:50:28,520
actually doing like PSD like the

1425
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:30,829

1429
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:40,800
I'm doing like you you have energy drink

00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:42,600
like ninja but I'd like there's a

1431
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,340

1432
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:46,650

sunshine like it tastes like sunshine

1437
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:56,880

partner with them and make my own

1441
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:03,120
flavors I think that one like run my own

1442
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:09,390
company like that with energy drinks

1443
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:11,010

00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:15,060
a lot of things how I mean I know you

1445
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:16,380
have a lot of energy and I can tell but

1446
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:18,780
I mean like how do you balance all of

1447
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:20,760
that because I mean that's that's a lot

1448
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:23,130
of things unless do you have help I mean

1449
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:24,390

1453
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,830
like my decisions obviously cuz that's

1454
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:33,660

1455
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:35,850
more like the business aspect of it and

1456
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:38,760
when it comes down to like being my like

1457
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:40,080

00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:01,620
oh honey it's pretty fun yeah like your

1467
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:04,370
little tagline we were singing it

1468
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:09,170
earlier just get stuck in your head

1469
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:12,180
that's with Amanda Cerny have a podcast

1470
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:14,610
good she was so she was on she was on

1471
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:16,860
vine first right you weren't on vine no

1472
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:18,630
yeah never did vine no I know I did up

1473
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:19,950
like you know when vines been around

1474
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:21,870
like when I was in high school and stuff

1475
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:23,400
so was my friends I would do like these

1476
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:26,010
little vines but I was never like famous

1477
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:27,330
or popular to get famous off fine yeah

1478
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:29,280
I'm just trying to remember the timeline

1479
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:30,990
of when I was big worse like Instagram

1480
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,690
cuz Instagram was first right I think

1481
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:35,370
the I think like people got famous off

1482
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:38,520
we're getting famous off vine before

1483
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:40,050
like yeah because I think Amanda I don't

1484
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:43,830
really know the timeline she's older

1485
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:47,220
than me she's 28 29 so and she's been

1486
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:48,870
doing this for a while so I think that I

1487
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:50,260
don't know it was like it was like vine

1488
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:51,700
maybe then it's Grammer Instagram was

1489
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:53,560
around when they were doing vine I was

1490
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:55,930
doing Instagram I don't know guys I

1491
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:57,310
think Instagram was like year it was a

1492
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:58,750
for a long time and then vine like

1493
00:52:57,310 --> 00:53:00,820
popped off really hard and then

1494
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:01,870
Instagram kind of adapted towards that

1495
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:03,700
mm-hmm

1496
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:05,290

00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:11,500

00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:26,499
yeah okay well that took a turn but the

1583
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:27,759
first one you guys are probably like

1584
00:56:26,499 --> 00:56:29,890

1585
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:32,469
but it's like no I mean most times it's

1586
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:33,640
not usually the I know a lot of times

1587
00:56:32,469 --> 00:56:35,170
when people tell those kind of stories

1588
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:38,019
and it's so crazy I don't believe it but

1589
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:40,059
that's so actually so minimal that I

1590
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:43,900
kind of I believe it I know people say

1591
00:56:40,059 --> 00:56:46,569
they're like crazy mmm yeah the tricking

1592
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:50,019
Panda do you have any weird or hidden

1593
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:51,430
talents oh yeah for sure guys like

1594
00:56:50,019 --> 00:56:57,700
people say I have no talent and then I

1595
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:59,319
do this whoa those were listening yeah

1596
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:01,719
she is touching your nose with her

1597
00:56:59,319 --> 00:57:07,630
tongue I can pick my nose with my tongue

1598
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:09,310
oh yeah yeah that's very deep

1599
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:13,080
so I just feel like like people think I

1600
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:14,440
have no talent but no way on the street

1601
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:16,870
do that

1602
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:19,030
like we've gone way back with that

1603
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:21,220
talent hmm can either of your parents do

1604
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:22,540
that my dad can do all this like weird

1605
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:24,520
stuff with his tongue too he like makes

1606
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:26,050
it into like a bowl like I hope I

1607
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:29,770
haven't conquered that I'm not like that

1608
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:37,960
level yet okay

1609
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:40,090
well good to know how do you figure that

1610
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,890
out as a talent like one day like where

1611
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:49,090

like like that's me like I don't know I

1615
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:58,470

people probably think we made it up

1620
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:09,310
because it's so weird but like we would

1621
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:11,260
