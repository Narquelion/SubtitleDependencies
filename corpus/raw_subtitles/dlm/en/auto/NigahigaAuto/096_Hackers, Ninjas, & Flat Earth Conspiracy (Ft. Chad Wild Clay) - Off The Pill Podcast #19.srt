00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:35,710
incredibly good you get a great house

203
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:38,290
for a good price number two taxes state

204
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:41,470
has zero percent income tax compared to

205
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:43,120
California top end is 13.3% so you're

206
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,920
saving a lot of money see when you say

207
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,060
numbers like that it's not so much but I

208
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,620
wouldn't have said that there's a point

209
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,110
something percent I know I didn't put

210
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:54,640
that in the details ero is better than

211
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:56,650
anything else and and no traffic yep

212
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,450
no well well except for on the strip and

213
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,790
when we get the readers Sunday's might

214
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:03,340
be okay but we are getting the Raiders

215
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:05,140
Oh getting our own NFL team we have a

216
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,870
hockey team that was in the Stanley Cup

217
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:11,410
yeah we and that's big in Minnesota

218
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:14,710
yes hockey I think also uh now we have a

219
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:17,140
WNBA team really do okay and then I

220
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:18,010
think we also have a baseball team I

221
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,900
don't I don't think they're in the

222
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:21,940
majors though it's uh I know what fields

223
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,500
being built yeah where's it being Bill I

224
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,790
think I think it might be done okay

225
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,880
I could be wrong I've been hearing about

226
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:30,430
this this Las Vegas getting a basketball

227
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,560
team for years though and I think that's

228
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:35,830
gonna be huge when that happens if it

229
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:38,590
happens but we were supposed to get the

230
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:40,660
Kings Sacramento Kings but we never did

231
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:41,440
but hopefully we get an expansion team

232
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,810
like the go tonight

233
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,699
and that might be quite you into any

234
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:47,350
other sports or you know I

235
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:49,600
yeah I did play basketball in like early

236
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,430
high school but now you know Ryan has

237
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,259
invited me to basketball once or twice

238
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,779
yeah cuz you're like seven foot eight

239
00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:58,089
yeah you true like I'm pretty rusty I'm

240
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:59,680
kind of nervous to play good so I look

241
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:01,029
you're being like if you played in high

242
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,300
school like I did we didn't play in high

243
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:03,759
school

244
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,800
okay and we play in that league yeah so

245
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:07,300
just based on fundamentals and your

246
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,670
height yeah you would probably be MVP

247
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:13,540
all right all the stuff that you do in

248
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:16,000
your videos like it's a lot of like no

249
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,379
anyway let's talk more about cuz let's

250
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,779
get back into you you know we wanna know

251
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:22,029
more about you yeah so you live in Vegas

252
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:25,060
tell us about Vegas I'm just go ahead go

253
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:27,850
ahead but uh like with your content it's

254
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:30,699
a little bit more like kids content and

255
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:33,100
you have to gear it towards a younger

256
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:34,990
audience but with the guidelines that

257
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,730
YouTube has and because your stuff is a

258
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:39,519
lot of like fighting hackers and there's

259
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:41,589
a lot of like not weapons but gadgets

260
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,180
gadgets you can't say weapon don't say

261
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:45,189
weapon you've had to adjust accordingly

262
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:47,560
so maybe you want to discuss the

263
00:09:45,189 --> 00:09:48,819
transition you know since the YouTube

264
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,459
algorithm is changed over these years

265
00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:52,779
yeah good question yeah it just keeps

266
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:54,370
changing and if you don't keep up you're

267
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:55,899
in trouble yeah we've definitely like

268
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,139
when we first started on YouTube back in

269
00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:00,100
2010 we were doing a lot of parodies

270
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:02,110
growing up I thought I was gonna be a

271
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,860
famous musician and that was my plan

272
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,870
that's my goal

273
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,639
played guitar and piano and all that

274
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:09,069
stuff and was in bands all through high

275
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:11,110
school and all that and YouTube was kind

276
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:13,269
of my creative outlet for doing music so

277
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:16,300
I was doing parodies I loved Weird Al

278
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:18,009
Yankovic yeah man so we used to do a lot

279
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,990
of parodies it was they were very like

280
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:21,430
kind of adult ish a little bit no

281
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:26,079
swearing or anything but very like

282
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:28,059
Saturday Night Live humour and just we

283
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:31,779
did that for many years never really

284
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:33,100
went crazy actually well the videos

285
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:34,420
would get like you know a million views

286
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,920
sometimes two million views but never

287
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,480
really built a huge fan base because I

288
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,850
think that style of content it's very

289
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,410
like you're in the mirror yet you're

290
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:44,410
there for the video not for the

291
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:46,269
personality essentially yeah and so we

292
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,860
moved we eventually moved to Los Angeles

293
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:49,870
once we hit like a hundred thousand

294
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,399
subscribers let's just give this a shot

295
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:53,680
we're not we're not really making any

296
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:54,670
money but if we did this full-time let's

297
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,280
let's just see what

298
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:59,080
Bin's at the time v was running she

299
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:02,950
owned her own curves fitness center for

300
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:06,100
women she sold it I co-owned a software

301
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:08,140
company still do so but I retired from

302
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,820
the day to day work on that and my

303
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:12,280
partner's took over the kind of

304
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,350
operations of that I came out here he

305
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,730
came out here and we just kind of

306
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,460
started experimenting with different

307
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:20,440
types of content we did some roasts of

308
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:22,240
youtubers i roasted ryan that's one of

309
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,700
the first ones I seen yeah I liked it

310
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,840
and I was annoyed too right yes yeah Bob

311
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,690
juice yeah for sure

312
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,790
those were fun did that for a while I

313
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:33,040
just kept experimenting

314
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:35,920
it was very influenced and inspired by

315
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,840
Mathias in fact I think I think you you

316
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,090
remember Mathias he was on it yeah yeah

317
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,650
I always said from the when the moment I

318
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:43,300
saw him was like I was telling him to

319
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:45,550
cuz he was on the same season oh cool

320
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,350
and I was like this guy's gonna be yeah

321
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:50,860
this guy well he one saw that this guy's

322
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:53,110
gonna be huge and it did yeah yeah so

323
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,690
yeah when we first moved to LA he was

324
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,070
the first person I had up at the time

325
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,360
yet we were at like a hundred thousand

326
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,890
subscribers he was at three hundred

327
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,120
thousand and I was like hey man you

328
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,770
wanna can I take you out to dinner and

329
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,660
just pick your brain talk YouTube

330
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:06,310
he was like yeah let's do it I thought

331
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:08,140
that was really cool of him to do that

332
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:10,870
and just became really good friends with

333
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:12,190
him and his wife and he always

334
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,360
encouraged me to experiment try

335
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,490
different things and he did - he used to

336
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,130
do parodies and songs in kept

337
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:19,720
experimenting till he found his niche so

338
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,210
it was very inspired by that tried a lot

339
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,490
of different things and then I think

340
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:26,590
once we decided you know let's try I was

341
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,930
like let's do something that I would

342
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:32,110
love when I was like 10 years old right

343
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:33,730
and from that thought process came you

344
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:35,650
know when I was 10 I loved the Teenage

345
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:37,300
Mutant Ninja Turtles so I'm gonna buy

346
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:41,080
all the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

347
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:43,240
ninja gadgets and test them out on fruit

348
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,800
chop them up and so doesn't all that me

349
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,240
and that video did really well like well

350
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,550
let's do some more of this and so we did

351
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,540
like 5 video game weapons and we would

352
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,100
choose different video games in

353
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,210
different movies test them out that

354
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,620
series did really real great so that's

355
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:56,170
kind of really what started to blow us

356
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:58,720
up on YouTube and kind of evolved from

357
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:03,280
there and I've probably got off topic of

358
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,600
your question yeah like Ryan could have

359
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,960
gone into that but the first time he

360
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:10,510
tried using weapons uh well I mean I

361
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,190
and they've advanced too well yeah I

362
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:14,350
tried to cut through fruit as well oh

363
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,580
okay um but it was more for it was

364
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:18,750
actually a skit I wasn't actually trying

365
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:21,089
to cut through it and it was recreating

366
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:23,740
fruit ninja in real life yeah yeah and

367
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:25,060
yeah I I tried to cut through a

368
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,740
watermelon and the watermelon hit the

369
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:29,410
sword the sword hit my nose and that's

370
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,940
why this scar here yeah and that was on

371
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:33,220
Mythbusters cuz they were like talking

372
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,480
about like was it fruit ninja I don't

373
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,589
know I didn't watch it wasn't yeah

374
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,990
and what were they saying on Mythbusters

375
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:39,120
I don't even remember the episode but

376
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,529
they were making fun of me

377
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,870
probably is like the 88 who like got cut

378
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,890
by a sword because of a Waterman trying

379
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,230
to cut a watermelon and they're

380
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,160
especially like this guy's in Asian and

381
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:54,040
he doesn't even know how to use a weapon

382
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:57,370
even worse Asian American definitely a

383
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,209
myth but he gotta be math I never I

384
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:03,910
would never

385
00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:05,320
I got a C but yeah so I mean continue

386
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,770
talking about you know you had to adapt

387
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,570
to it

388
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:09,430
yeah these things so yeah I just kind of

389
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:10,779
kept adapting and we still do you know

390
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:13,180
we still like pay very close attention

391
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:14,920
to our analytics we're very yeah very

392
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:17,830
analytical we have a team of five people

393
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:20,529
who do our YouTube videos with and I

394
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:23,170
guess I like to say we're probably the

395
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:26,200
most viewed youtubers that no one's ever

396
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:28,990
heard of we right now last 30 days we

397
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:32,040
got 250 million views that's crazy

398
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:34,959
and yeah did your videos I mean I don't

399
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,550
always see them but when I see them and

400
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,560
I go check out your channel it's like oh

401
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,940
one day ago three minutes like cutie-pie

402
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,070
numbers in his prime yeah

403
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,240
not that he's not trying but it was like

404
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,800
you know cuz you guys post often how

405
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,390
often I've right now five days a week

406
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,440

know it's pretty crazy yeah it's really

410
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:55,329
crazy and I'm surprised that like I mean

411
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,339
like you said like it's weird that you

412
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:59,110
get you're getting all this attention

413
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:01,300
but it's like in the realm I guess of

414
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:03,010
like talking about bigger youtubers that

415
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,390
are blowing up right it's all about like

416
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:06,250
who's making the news like with the

417
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:08,140
drama news drama yeah so if you guys had

418
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,420

00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:14,380
guys have a lot of views right yeah for

420
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:16,930
sure yeah right so all you gotta do is

421
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:20,709
attack a famous youtuber with you ninja

422
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:22,030
gadgets you're in there someone who's

423
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:24,370
been on YouTube for a really

424
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:26,080
long time what do you think now you got

425
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:29,080
to go for somebody who's in the new yeah

426
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,820
not somebody here elephant's irrelevant

427
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,210
yeah you gotta go for somebody who's

428
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:37,030
like like like fighting yeah

429
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:38,760
oh she do a boxing match and then Midway

430
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:42,400
do the boxing match bring out your

431
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,350
gadgets mm-hmm and then kill just get

432
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,730
disqualified

433
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:47,260
it'll be demonetised but people will be

434
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:53,410
talking about that's true like that

435
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:54,940
crazy youtuber yeah gadgets yeah yeah so

436
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,380
you know we're thinking like since you

437
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:58,240
are very analytical I mean I'm sure even

438
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,920
noticed the trends and those things

439
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,610
working obviously that's not your thing

440
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:05,260
that's not our thing either so yeah yeah

441
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:06,610
but what if we were to evolve it because

442
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,560
it's always about thinking ahead right

443
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:10,210
so what if we were to take that fighting

444
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,210
this whole drama scene to the next level

445
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:15,370
right and what if it is ninja battles

446
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:19,180
ninja battles yeah ninja battle royale

447
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:20,470
you tell me that would not be clickable

448
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,210
with a bunch of youtube I mean you'd

449
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:24,010
have to get them to do it but I mean

450
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:27,280
come on already kind of did that they

451
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:32,020
did yeah well we are mr. beast did that

452
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:33,760
whole battle royale with a bunch of yeah

453
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,080
but that would be even harder to film if

454
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,400
you're gonna do it in darkness and at

455
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,890
night and then you have loud people

456
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,630
going welcome over there and you're

457
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:42,730
gonna go and Dave Mack them in the face

458
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:44,380
it will do it Mortal Kombat style like

459
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,670
not necessarily in the night jury you

460
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,950
know you know arena

461
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,840
realm type things like little torches

462
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:54,070
all over the place exactly for our for

463
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:55,960
our dudes like yeah with spikes with

464
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,580
spikes see now we're thinking tell me

465
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,710
that would not be I mean granted we'd

466
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,940
have to I'm trying I'm really trying to

467
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:03,580
make a version of it but that's a lot of

468
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:05,560
paperwork that's a lot of paper well but

469
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,910
yeah that's the future though guys if

470
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,340
you want that give this video a thumbs

471
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:10,840
up yeah and then you know what if you

472
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:13,510
know how to say uh I've never done this

473
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:16,810
before but I saw recently Anthony did

474
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:20,020
like oh if it gets so many likes I would

475
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:21,580
do something yeah but his video reached

476
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,510
that crazy amount of things I don't know

477
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,310
what he has to do but it's something

478
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:31,480
ridiculous and I don't want to do that

479
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:34,030
oh okay it works so go to jail yeah yes

480
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,860
once like if he gets enough 40,000 like

481
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,850
yeah it was on a BTS video so it's just

482
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,309
we didn't think it's gonna get that many

483
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:41,260
it did I said puck was going to jail so

484
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:43,330
he's still has to go to jail I have to

485
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,070
run a tank through a house because of

486
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:47,500
thumbs up maybe we haven't done that yet

487
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,880
actual attain a real tank so what one of

488
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,980
my favorite videos we've ever done was

489
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,799
we went to Minnesota they have tanks you

490
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:56,260
can drive army tanks and we I actually

491
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:57,640
in Minnesota yeah I didn't know that I

492
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,350
mean it's Minnesota they don't have much

493
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,179
else to do yeah exactly we just have

494
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:02,230
open fields and army tanks that's all we

495
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:05,769
have my job likings

496
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:09,490
yeah basketball football and hockey

497
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:13,510
right yes a lot of they're just not

498
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:16,510
having the best but yeah I rode I've

499
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:17,409
drove an army tank over two bands two

500
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,090
cars and crushed them

501
00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:21,309
that's really fun sounds like if this

502
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:24,760
video gets and it's just a number that

503
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:26,889
never hit if this video gets 192

504
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:31,210
thousand thumbs up I'll run this through

505
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:33,429
a house any case the because the tank

506
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:35,230
place was like we have a special package

507
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:38,350
it's only like eighty thousand dollars

508
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:39,970
you can buy a trailer house type thing

509
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,159
you could run the tank through it I was

510
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:43,840
like oh they offer it so maybe I'll I

511
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:46,899
didn't think whatever the return the

512
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,240
investment there is yeah I mean you're

513
00:18:46,899 --> 00:18:51,190
getting into mr. B's territory now you

514
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,380
need to have a sponsor yeah that's

515
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:55,899
that's pretty crazy yeah but I mean you

516
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:57,250
gotta do it yeah good yeah we're still

517
00:18:55,899 --> 00:18:58,899

519
00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:03,220
go to jail eventually too right yeah

520
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,260
it's either you are real reason for real

521
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:08,500
yeah it's just a matter of time a real

522
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:11,019
crime yeah so that's how we don't make

523
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,269
those bets anymore because we I don't

524
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:14,980
want to not do what we're supposed to be

525
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:17,200

566
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,420

00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,100

00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:00,380
you can everyone came in anyway and just

573
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:02,840
worked a normal day yeah they're like we

574
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:04,460
know nobody else here yeah you're our

575
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,130
only friends that's true that's true

576
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:09,860
we met one of them yeah one didn't you

577
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,910
guys Melvin he plays basketball we're

578
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:17,510
still trying to convince we're just

579
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:19,460
trying to get him but I just asked

580
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:22,070
because I think that is I mean it's it's

581
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:23,810
commendable but do you think it's a

582
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:26,030
long-term thing because I feel like

583
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:27,890
that's that sustained a burnt out for

584
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:29,180
sure that songs that sound mean it's

585
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:31,370
good because you're taking advantage of

586
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:33,710
the situation yeah just you should yeah

587
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:35,240
yeah but that is that sounds like I mean

588
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,800
most I mean I don't think anyone can do

589
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,780
that no I consistently that sounds

590
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,010
exhausting yeah it is for sure yeah

591
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,930
we're we're trying to figure out how to

592
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:44,300
how to get down to normal all right

593
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:46,340
we'll get there yeah bring it on and

594
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,690
bringing on more people helps yes I hope

595
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,100
so you know they'll be they'll be a

596
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:50,360
period where it probably has requires

597
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,870
more work because yeah I trained them in

598
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:55,580
but mm-hmm okay yeah cool unless you

599
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:57,260
unless you you know find someone who

600
00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:00,410
already has some YouTube experience and

601
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:01,010
I would be horrible for your channel

602
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:03,860
yeah

603
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:06,110
yeah because I'm I like cuss a lot I'm

604
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:08,120
very not family-friendly yeah you would

605
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:10,700
hear the kids would not be people talk

606
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:13,820
trash in the comments about me I go at

607
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:16,309
them respond he's a responder iris first

608
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:18,440
responder he definitely responded

609
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:20,570
instead of giving first aid I just hurt

610
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,590
him more I make it worse so the parents

611
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:24,830
would be like you can't watch these

612
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:27,200
channels anymore yeah exactly yeah but

613
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:30,080

I've that that follow me I like that in

654
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:50,150

655
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:51,890
that people who follow me that have

656
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:54,169
interacted with me like the most active

657
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:56,270

00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:30,590
contact your partner manager about this

675
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:32,120
and I was like they say why you don't

676
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:34,010
have a it's because there's there's a

677
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:37,070
manual review of process now yeah yeah

678
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:39,020
and they said that my video head blood

679
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:41,270
and gore in it which none of my videos

680
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:43,100
do so the manual reviewer was like this

681
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:45,200
video contains violence blood and gore

682
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,700
like no it doesn't assume it's a

683
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,650
violence and I said if you disagree with

684
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,730
this please contact your partner manager

685
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:52,300
is like I don't have a partner manager

686
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:55,310
so wait you don't have a partner man you

687
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:56,060
know that is incredible I don't think I

688
00:24:55,310 --> 00:25:07,280
have one either

689
00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:08,750
well that is predictable no but no but

690
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,460
let's bureau that's that's pretty

691
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,840
ridiculous I mean the mound that you've

692
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,610
been on for a while you've been posting

693
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,290
consistently I'm not saying Papa doesn't

694
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:17,630
deserve one you should have one too

695
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:19,160
you deserve one too yes but it is

696
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:21,920
ridiculous that you don't have one and

697
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:23,600
we should I mean that's a simple we

698
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,190
should get you a partner manager it just

699
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,320
it just said even someone just someone

700
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,790
there to be like hey this is not right

701
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,430
yeah the thing that people don't realize

702
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:32,780
is like yes you can anyone can attack a

703
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,700
video like copyright strike it whatever

704
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:36,320
it is yeah and even if it's not true you

705
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,970
can get it you can fight it you'll win

706
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,680
and they'll switch it but it takes time

707
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,930
and all that time that that's happening

708
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:44,330
somebody else is benefiting yeah and

709
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:46,220
that's the ridiculous part so I mean you

710
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:48,380
should it's kind of crazy to me that you

711
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,460
don't like there's not many other people

712
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,320
there's a lot of youtubers to get views

713
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:53,480
but not the same a trainer ship is you

714
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:56,810
you know like I think that's kind of its

715
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:59,660
kind of ridiculous yeah sure you know I

716
00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:01,520
used to have one uh-huh but usually they

717
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,870
pass you on to somebody else yeah that's

718
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,910

00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,680
Bell for quite a while I remember your

733
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,740
saying that house like smoothing with

734
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:55,240
the bigwigs at a Taco Bell in fact but

735
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,890
they they do know who I am and they have

736
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,890
invited me to many things mm-hmm they

737
00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:02,200
invited me to the Taco Bell Thanksgiving

738
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:03,940
dinner right where they invite like 30

739
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,160
youtubers and some other people it's

740
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,660
really cool cuz all all the like YouTube

741
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,920
chefs are there mm-hmm

742
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,870
that sounds kind of funny to say YouTube

743
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,520
chef yeah but like these are like like

744
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:14,760
legit chefs you know and they're like

745
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:17,680
goal is to make a Thanksgiving dinner

746
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,420
but each item each like the turkey and

747
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,460
the stuffing and all this has to use one

748
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:23,680
Taco Bell ingredient so like the for

749
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:26,020
example they had like the honey glazed

750
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:30,520
ham but instead of honey glazed it was

751
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:33,910
Baja blast glaze wow it was so good it

752
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:37,150
was really good Bob glasses dope it is

753
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:41,920
my picture with Turkey little ham ham

754
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:44,860
ham that changes everything difference a

755
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:47,370
big turkey it's two different things

756
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:50,020
no no but I go to Taco Bell so much that

757
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:53,380
so when I moved from Minnesota to

758
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:56,170
California the Taco Bell employee got me

759
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:57,130
a going-away present no I'm gonna miss

760
00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:00,820
you so much

761
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:04,360
yeah yeah so I went there like every day

762
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:08,020
damn talk about yeah well I mean I I

763
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:09,760
tried to pitch a show up like I guess

764
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,860
it's like a documentary it was it was

765
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,230
like based off of supersize me but it

766
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:16,600
was it was like Taco Bell but my goal

767
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:18,160
was to prove that and this is like five

768
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,450
years ago my goal was to prove that you

769
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,860
could eat talked about every day three

770
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:23,230
times a day yeah and still lose weight

771
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:24,520
yeah and I still and I still think I

772
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:26,530
could do it I think it's very possible

773
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,480
I'm not trying to say and recently they

774
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:30,730
released an article that talked about

775
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,190

778
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:39,080

783
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:53,029
that but they didn't want to do it so

784
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:55,039
weird like hey I want to make your

785
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:57,710

to push right now yeah you know yeah

791

timings everything

792
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:14,510
I actually did something when they first

793
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:17,090
release Baja blast but it never released

794
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:18,830
but they still paid me for it that's

795
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:20,570
nice but it was yeah I don't remember

796
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:23,059
why it didn't go through with the

797
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:25,130
campaign but it's cuz they saw Carl's

798
00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:26,809
jr. and they're like I think that's why

799
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,769
they hit me up for it was wrong that

800
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:31,130

823
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:42,830

824
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:44,710
wants you to sleep more and it's like

825
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:47,510
the more you sleep like you can catch

826
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:50,600

827
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:52,390

828
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,280
really nice that was

829
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:57,930
yeah you know how much sound effect for

830
00:30:54,280 --> 00:31:01,110
a drum hit but don't surprise we GUI

831
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:04,540
there you go that's kind of quiet but

832
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:05,590
okay alright and this is so that's right

833
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:12,700
afterwards it'll be really cool

834
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:14,530
yeah be way funnier so they announced

835
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,930
that a Pokemon study will be turning

836
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:19,300
sleeping into entertainment much in the

837
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:21,040
same way that Pokemon go turned walking

838
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:22,810
into entertain could you try to make

839
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:33,120
everyone healthy that sounds like a

840
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:35,350
nightmare okay I mean that's really good

841
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,590
it was in the new I didn't hear anything

842
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:40,870
about that is that recent it was a

843
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:43,740
Tuesday it was on Tuesday did you play

844
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:46,690
any of those regular Pokemon I did

845
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:48,220
collaborate with the Pokemon go song kid

846
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:50,890
do you remember him Misha

847
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:53,850
speaking of retro youtubers although it

848
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:53,850
was like four years ago

849
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:04,150
Misha famous kid from Czechoslovakia

850
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:05,830
really okay well it was it was great but

851
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:08,590
you didn't play the game I did not know

852
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:10,450
well we kind of played it a little bit

853
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:13,600
but I got over it pretty quick cuz it

854
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:16,390
required walking in the house yeah no

855
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,610
but so many people I actually did it now

856
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:20,260
I'm wondering like this makes actually

857
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:22,690
surprisingly this makes more sense

858
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:23,980
because people actually play games for

859
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,690
that reason like there's Idol games

860
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,340
where you don't need to play yeah to

861
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:29,680
play the game true and that's huge right

862
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:31,240
now so if it's anything like that it

863
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,250
could work better than Pokemon go

864
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,760
actually yeah I mean it's like

865
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:37,540
interesting that you can but I want to

866
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,090
know how they're gonna turn

867
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:42,070
entertainment or sleep into

868
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:44,320
entertainment yeah I don't get that

869
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:45,490
either yeah they're gonna hook wires up

870
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,440
to your head while you're sleeping and

871
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:56,800
read your dreams it's just a it's a ruse

872
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:58,600
to gather information find out more

873
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,160
about you there how do you know how much

874
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,480
do you know about conspiracies do you

875
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,860
look into those I kind of like

876
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,540
conspiracies I don't believe in them I

877
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,740
think they're really fun same me - yeah

878
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,790
- cool sometimes when it's really

879
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,650
creative it's like man

880
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:11,560
that's such a stretch but you put in the

881
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:13,210
effort yeah like it takes talent to

882
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,950
piece together all these things right I

883
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:16,570
could fit together and what's the most

884
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:22,150
recent conspiracy that you've looked

885
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:24,220
into um gosh I kind of like gosh done

886
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:26,020
recently I never got into the Flat Earth

887
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:28,360
stuff I know it's kind of more recent I

888
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:30,330
saw that I watched the documentary on

889
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,800
Netflix I was actually pretty interest

890
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:35,200
off ladders thing was just people like

891
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,190
trolling I thought I thought that - I

892
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,170
loved it

893
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:39,790
yeah people actually believe that see

894
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:42,400
when you look it up though and you watch

895
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:44,080
like you know you it you when you say

896
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,550
flat-earthers you picture a certain kind

897
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,680
of person you're like okay that person

898
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:48,850
is ridiculous this is so out of the

899
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,380
realm of possibility

900
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:51,460
but then when you have these people who

901
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,680
like oh you actually sound like

902
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:55,810
articulate and you yeah it's just like I

903
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:58,120
can see why some like most people would

904
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:59,680
fall for that well I can see the

905
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,690
arguments are there like if you ever

906
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:04,090
really get into it okay not that I'm not

907
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:06,190
saying I believe that are this flat but

908
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:07,000
the arguments are really energy yeah if

909
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:08,860
you like it with the entertainment

910
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,660
factor yeah I think you'll like it's

911
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:12,250
like oh wow they put a lot of thought

912
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:14,290
into this they have a little dance yeah

913
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:16,720
they're studying like flight patterns

914
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:18,340
and like why certain planes fly a

915
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,040
certain way instead of like they eat the

916
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:23,919
quicker route yeah okay and then also

917
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:26,230
certain things like oh like the degrees

918
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:27,370
of Earth and how like oh I shouldn't be

919
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:30,280
able to see this far into the distance

920
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:35,740
but I do okay it's it's actually is like

921
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:37,210
oh you see like the alright earth I'm a

922
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:40,090
flat Chester okay

923
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:42,250
I can't develop muscles but good yeah

924
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:46,990
you're something else there I mean that

925
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:50,200
- but I should keep it family-friendly

926
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:52,750
yeah but uh yeah basically the whole

927
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:54,130
thing it it shows in the beginning of

928
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:56,350
the documentary like a lot of stuff that

929
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:57,880
makes you kind of like oh I can see like

930
00:34:56,350 --> 00:35:00,940
how this possibly make sense and you

931
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:03,850
start to like slowly question all that

932
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:05,680
you believe yeah and and then I guess in

933
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:08,200
the latter part of it the scientists

934
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:11,140
come in and they're like explaining like

935
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,700
yeah but the thing too is like the

936
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:14,140
scientists they're surgeons the thing I

937
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,610
like about is the certain scientist and

938
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:18,220
it's not necessarily a flat or

939
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:20,290
documentary talks about more when you

940
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:22,540
are educated in

941
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:25,150
in a certain way of thinking and it's

942
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:27,460
been proven and stuff don't always be so

943
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:30,010
quick to look down on others yeah you

944
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:32,890
know these people who are flat earthers

945
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:34,570
what they said was view them as people

946
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:36,280
who could have been potential scientists

947
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:38,080
but we're just miss educated you know

948
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:40,120
because they're doing their own form of

949
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,970
learning and they're aspiring you know

950
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:44,740
right but so what you can do is you can

951
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:45,970
mentor them so don't be so quick to like

952
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,320
look down on them these people are

953
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:48,280
actually like like you said articulate

954
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,500
smart they're doing their own research

955
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,450
they're finding out things yeah it's not

956
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,160
easy to make up I mean to come up with

957
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,690
that stuff there believe it and even

958
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,750
have their findings are true even though

959
00:35:55,690 --> 00:36:00,460
they can be disproved a lot of it to

960
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:03,760
even come up with that is like amazing -

961
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:06,130
yeah but in the same way and I guess the

962
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:10,360
argument is and again I'm not defending

963
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:12,700
it I'm just saying you know one of the

964
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,260
arguments are that obviously the weight

965
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,460
the reason why we are already feeling a

966
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:17,260
certain way the moment we say the earth

967
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:20,680
is flat and everybody's like okay dude

968
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:22,090
is because from the moment were born you

969
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,190
know and we're brought up in a world

970
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:25,780
they show us globes they show us on TV

971
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:27,370
everything you've ever seen and learned

972
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:29,830
in school everything you were taught was

973
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:31,390
you know a certain way of course you're

974
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:33,610
gonna think it's read Atrios the moment

975
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:35,230
like I mean if everybody told us the

976
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:37,570
earth was flat and we had pictures of

977
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:39,340
like in space of a flat earth right our

978
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:41,170
whole lives and all of a sudden someone

979
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:42,880
was like you know what I think it's a

980
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:45,520
globe I think it's round like this is

981
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,260
ridiculous people make any sense like it

982
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,270
we would be think about that like it

983
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,830
could be something not that I'm saying

984
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:52,750
that I believe that because I don't know

985
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:54,790
but there is a point something percent

986
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:56,860
chance that flat earthers are completely

987
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:58,690
right now but there's never a hundred

988
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:59,950
percent there's no 100% of anything yeah

989
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:01,300
science doesn't even believe in how

990
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:04,510
you're sitting in the matrix right now

991
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:06,820
it could be yep what is it flat or is it

992
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:09,100
a round matrix look at the source code

993
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:10,840
sure well then you'd have to hack into

994
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,550
the system yeah and that's why we bring

995
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,950
it back to hackers hackers you're a

996
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:16,740
hacker I'm not a hacker oh well when you

997
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:20,940
play basketball you might be Oh

998
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:24,460
hacking jack yeah a little deep

999
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:26,440
different big big just talking about

1000
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:28,450
that but uh Oh for the flatter thing I

1001
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,980
wasn't so much looking at it in terms of

1002
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:31,450
like believing the flattered but what I

1003
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,320
liked about it it's something that we

1004
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:35,180
can uh create an analogy

1005
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:37,490
to a lot of other things is when we have

1006
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:39,500
a certain way of thinking sometimes

1007
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:41,150
we're so quick to judge others because

1008
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:43,190
they don't think how we think where it's

1009
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:44,900
like oh you know you believe in Flat

1010
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:46,760
Earth meant like you're dumb yeah you're

1011
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,710
not you're not here trying to explain it

1012
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,960
you're not here trying to like show a

1013
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:52,760
new perspective you have this elitist

1014
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:56,030
mentality where you wanna just like brag

1015
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:59,350
over others yeah yeah and I want to

1016
00:37:56,030 --> 00:38:02,360
transition that into another thing where

1017
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:04,670
the state of Missouri is now looking to

1018
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,480
shut down their last abortion clinic oh

1019
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:07,670
gosh

1020
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,290
yeah there mm-hmm and following Alabama

1021
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:11,420
I was gonna say is in this Alabama it's

1022
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:11,630
no Georgie Alabama's voted on it all

1023
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,610
right

1024
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:15,350
and so but the state of Missouri is

1025
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:16,970
looking to shut down there.last you guys

1026
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:21,350
are like trying to get demonetized right

1027
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:23,750
now what's the biggest things in news

1028
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:25,910
just like what what is your thoughts how

1029
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:27,440
can i how can I say gwei into this uh uh

1030
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:32,630
Ryan's like you're not getting paid and

1031
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:33,800
I'm like neither are you so I'm just

1032
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:34,910
going into that because you know a lot

1033
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,230
of people are like oh pro-life

1034
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:38,120
pro-choice oh you don't get this you're

1035
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:40,160
dumb and it's just like that whole opera

1036
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,600
right not necessarily asking maybe what

1037
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,520
your stance is on it maybe you if you

1038
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:46,760
want to go into that but it's more just

1039
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,900
like uh do you like what are your

1040
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,490
thoughts more so on like the whole

1041
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,260
elitist mentality cuz that'sthat's huge

1042
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:54,590
everywhere yeah I mean with all that

1043
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:56,090
stuff I love to have my mind changed I

1044
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:58,910
always try to keep my mind open like I

1045
00:38:56,090 --> 00:39:00,800
do believe certain things but if someone

1046
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:02,750
wants to try to convince me otherwise

1047
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,310
I'm like totally down and I'm definitely

1048
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:06,290
willing to like have my mind changed I

1049
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:07,520
in fact I find it super enjoyable it's

1050
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:09,560
like dang I never thought of that before

1051
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,210
I would have known that maybe I think a

1052
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:13,220
little differently so I think if that's

1053
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:15,200
just a good mindset to have same for

1054
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:18,710
everything I agree with that I think for

1055
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:22,370
uh the thing for us though a lot of

1056
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:25,250
youtubers who are low-level drama is

1057
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:26,420
they're very open minded yeah yeah what

1058
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:28,160
do you mean it's hard to get it'll drama

1059
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:30,320
when you don't have like a super hard

1060
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,240
opinion on yeah right right right

1061
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,220
yeah because you're so fluid with things

1062
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,750
cuz you're willing to be swayed you're

1063
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:38,090
willing to have listened to the other

1064
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:39,980
side right yeah maybe I'm wrong about

1065
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:41,960
this yeah just to have that thought you

1066
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:43,850
know yeah I mean I always have that

1067
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,340
thought process for most things but I've

1068
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:47,030
found that even that can be called out

1069
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:49,460
on

1070
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:50,720
because then you know giving people the

1071
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:53,600
benefit of the doubt a lot of times like

1072
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,490
even if you question the the the

1073
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:59,240
majority a lot of times though they'll

1074
00:39:55,490 --> 00:40:00,920
find ways to mark you to as like on the

1075
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:03,520
wrong side like they'll call you an

1076
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:05,780
apologist right like people people were

1077
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,970
shooting what's a good example like wait

1078
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:10,040
like when the whole like when the

1079
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:11,660
president wanted to talk to I think when

1080
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,460
Obama said yeah I'd be willing to talk

1081
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:16,580
to Iran or wherever how how could you

1082
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:18,260
even listen to them right yeah exactly

1083
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,730
and then people would just jump on you

1084
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:21,620
and and if you have opinions about

1085
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:25,940
something else too like for example like

1086
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:28,040
the Logan Paul situation right and how

1087
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:30,740
everybody was completely against him and

1088
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:32,510
everybody gets how you know wrong it is

1089
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,830
right I was there thinking like well I

1090
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:36,950
don't think he's the devil

1091
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:39,800
like I think he definitely didn't

1092
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:41,420
realize it was gonna be you know he

1093
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,590
wasn't he wasn't trying to I don't think

1094
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,760
he was trying to offend any but I think

1095
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:45,890
he was just think about himself and like

1096
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,000
how can I make this interesting but

1097
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:48,050
people were treating it like he's the

1098
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,570
he's the devil

1099
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:52,310
like he's literally like has no respect

1100
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:53,600
for people who are you know but if I

1101
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:55,670
were to come on say that it's like Oh

1102
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,050
Ryan's being an apologist like yeah but

1103
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:58,400
I'm not I'm just saying like I think

1104
00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:00,680
people are taking this a little far like

1105
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,480
hoping he dies you know like right it's

1106
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:04,490
a little ridiculous what's it's really

1107
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:11,560
fun right now for people to like jump on

1108
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:11,560
the bandwagon of anger I don't know it's

1109
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:20,380
canceled culture because in a way it's

1110
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:23,180
it's a you get to end someone without

1111
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:25,400
directly doing it right and so you and

1112
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:27,710
you can feel like superior like yeah and

1113
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:31,910
again so you know back to the elite ease

1114
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:33,980
alleviated mentality yeah yeah so I you

1115
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:37,550
know and I think it's gonna get to the

1116
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:39,680
point where like a lot of people want

1117
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:41,420
others to be cancelled yeah

1118
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,550
from my perspective I think is because

1119
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:46,940
they feel like oh I've done bad things

1120
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:49,370
you know but if I can make other people

1121
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:51,830
who have done equally or worse things

1122
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:53,390
right like get cancelled and stuff then

1123
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:55,160
it makes me feel better yeah you know

1124
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:56,720
because now I'm doing a good thing I'm

1125
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:59,300
doing a holy thing so maybe it cancels

1126
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,070
out my fault my sins or my past

1127
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,660
yeah gonna make yourself feel better

1128
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:05,450
right yeah also thing a lot of people

1129
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:07,190
just genuinely believe they're right and

1130
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:09,050
they just think this is the right thing

1131
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:11,030
for like I mean not saying that they're

1132
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:13,580
not but that they believe this is right

1133
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:15,140
and the majority agrees with me so if

1134
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:17,150
you think otherwise you're just wrong

1135
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:20,240
all right I'm gonna pose a question now

1136
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:21,890
okay so are you asking for a friend

1137
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,900
how good to someone have to be to get

1138
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:26,870
away with a crime well speaking from

1139
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:28,100
experience in the YouTube world in the

1140
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:29,680
YouTube world thank you I think you

1141
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,820
answered it like you just have to be

1142
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,290
popular like you just have to be

1143
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:35,240
populating that it's not even Talent

1144
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:37,220
really while some people might consider

1145
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:38,750
it talent but if the more popular you

1146
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:40,580
are the more you can get away with but

1147
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:43,010
Logan was super popular you know yeah

1148
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:44,470
but for what reasons people never saw

1149
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:46,730
him as that way but I mean he's still

1150
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:48,530
making videos like it might not be where

1151
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:52,210
he was at but how about PewDiePie cuz

1152
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:52,210
he's still like where he's exactly yeah

1153
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:57,830
yep and it that's talent in itself to

1154
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:01,160
get yourself out of those situations

1155
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:03,230
like PewDiePie knew what he liked he

1156
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,520
knew how to turn everything again you

1157
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:06,260
know he was smart enough to be like hey

1158
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:08,330
these articles said this let me prove

1159
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:10,460
them wrong like he's he knew that's a

1160
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:12,560
talent to do that Chloe didn't have that

1161
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:14,720
skill yeah and that whole situation with

1162
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,940
PDA I think he gained way more of a

1163
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:19,190
loyal following from that and I think he

1164
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:21,350
learned from it and I just saw I could

1165
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:22,940
see what his mindset was it and he stuck

1166
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:25,250
with that mentality he's like hey ie

1167
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:27,170
it's me versus them miiverse this person

1168
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:29,030
me versety series it's always like if I

1169
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:31,670
can get other people on my side and make

1170
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:33,200
it give myself an enemy it helps build

1171
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:35,210
that because you give yourself a

1172
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,410
competitor you know and that's it is

1173
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:37,700
what it is and that's how the whole

1174
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:39,260
drama scene works too that's why it

1175
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:41,660
builds people when it's someone for

1176
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:43,310
someone and that's just I mean that's

1177
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,170
just how that's all it's always been

1178
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:46,670
yeah right like the equal amount of subs

1179
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:50,290
James Charles lost

1180
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:50,290
Tatia games yeah exactly

1181
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:56,720
yeah t-series just hit a hundred million

1182
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:58,520
saw that channel ever crazy did you ever

1183
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:01,250
think that it would get to those numbers

1184
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:04,730
back in the day back in the day meaning

1185
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:07,010
like 2008-2009 everybody was that like a

1186
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:08,900
million yeah at the most I would say and

1187
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:10,760
I know that when you were the number one

1188
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:13,190
most subbed YouTube channel

1189
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:15,170
there was a very for

1190
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:16,789
Tom I was it was for like less than a

1191
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:19,069
week oh okay because it was like I

1192
00:44:16,789 --> 00:44:20,990
passed I think it was Smosh or and then

1193
00:44:19,069 --> 00:44:22,460
Fred Fred asked me like a week I was

1194
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:24,770
like well I was there for a little bit I

1195
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:26,240
was like who's Fred yeah and then I

1196
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:28,670
think it was like what

1197
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,450
I passed Fred again or something and

1198
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:31,789
then Ray came

1199
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:33,740
oh great william johnson then he do you

1200
00:44:31,789 --> 00:44:35,480
want to just quit and then Smosh passed

1201
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:38,119
him or something like that and then

1202
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:40,640
PewDiePie the rise of PewDiePie and he's

1203
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:42,170
just been killing it that's what the

1204
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,059
algorithm changed for the first time

1205
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:48,140
yeah it was based on my gaming long

1206
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:50,900
content something like that and see but

1207
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:53,089
like like and I've been in this mindset

1208
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:55,490
of like hey I want to get back I would

1209
00:44:53,089 --> 00:44:57,289
be like man PewDiePie's content is it's

1210
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:58,579
not real like I would've started

1211
00:44:57,289 --> 00:45:00,950
something so ever been my chambers his

1212
00:44:58,579 --> 00:45:02,690
team yeah but I just didn't want do that

1213
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:05,150
and then in the back you boy drama hey

1214
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:06,829
Felix do we got each other exactly and

1215
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:08,180
we would have both grieve and faster but

1216
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:10,609
he didn't need that I mean he was

1217
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:12,799
already milk in the system and he killed

1218
00:45:10,609 --> 00:45:14,329
it you know the thing I respect about

1219
00:45:12,799 --> 00:45:16,160
him because at first I was like I didn't

1220
00:45:14,329 --> 00:45:17,750
like his content I was like this is not

1221
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,010
entertaining to me to watch somebody it

1222
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:20,960
wasn't normal to watch them play games

1223
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:23,059
right at the time - yeah and the thing I

1224
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,829
respect about him is that he he realized

1225
00:45:23,059 --> 00:45:27,020
like okay this is working but I'm gonna

1226
00:45:24,829 --> 00:45:29,329
evolve and he changed his content to

1227
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:30,650
what he does not like he actually

1228
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:32,299
evolved he didn't just stick with the

1229
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:34,609
one thing and just keep doing it over

1230
00:45:32,299 --> 00:45:36,140
and over cuz it works and that's when I

1231
00:45:34,609 --> 00:45:38,390
realized okay he's actually smart he's

1232
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:39,920
not just like doing something he gets

1233
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:41,569
what he's doing very few youtubers can

1234
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,309
do that yeah sure some people get lucky

1235
00:45:41,569 --> 00:45:44,480
they make it they realize oh this works

1236
00:45:43,309 --> 00:45:46,130
I'm gonna latch on to it but they don't

1237
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,230
evolve right and then the algorithm

1238
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:51,500
eventually changes and then they exactly

1239
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:58,190
him yep so I look like PewDiePie if he

1240
00:45:51,500 --> 00:46:02,450
never slept why because his eyes are

1241
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:03,740
smaller my eyes are smaller yeah no

1242
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:04,609
really I mean I don't I think you're

1243
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:05,930
just being racist

1244
00:46:04,609 --> 00:46:07,220
I think you're just a racist so you just

1245
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:10,220
think all white people look the same

1246
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:11,420
yeah nah not true there's definitely

1247
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:14,119
there's definitely different doesn't

1248
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:16,200
look anything like Felix because you

1249
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:18,640
can't go yeah

1250
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,600
actually can you grow like a full beard

1251
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,390
no I can't

1252
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:25,180
really know I've never been able to same

1253
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:26,560
I just shaved today because I knew I was

1254
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:29,860
gonna see Paco and he just makes fun of

1255
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:32,830
me do the use and girl here for me and

1256
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:34,240
just like patches whatever all right

1257
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:36,580
well let's get into Twitter questions

1258
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,200
okay because I actually kind of see

1259
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:40,650
something that kind of wraps up a lot of

1260
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:45,450
what we talked about you know you uh

1261
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:49,540
someone says oh it's from Mickey five

1262
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:51,220
Luke yeah yeah but they said you're the

1263
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:53,140
master at always tweaking your content

1264
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:55,090
to keep your channel fresh if the

1265
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:56,770
YouTube algorithm wasn't a thing and you

1266
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:58,720
were guaranteed to get millions of views

1267
00:46:56,770 --> 00:47:00,160
per video what type of content would you

1268
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,410
produce and I think I want to see from

1269
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,090
both of you guys yes I think for Ryan

1270
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:10,300
what he would produce is just him

1271
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:13,510
sleeping ah the past go ahead okay um I

1272
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:16,360
mean if the algorithm wasn't a thing I

1273
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:17,830
probably would have never been forced to

1274
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:20,050
like venture away from making parodies

1275
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:22,300
because news I really yeah really loved

1276
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:23,680
doing it it's a really great creative

1277
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,790
outlet I used to like recreate all the

1278
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:28,210
music and like play all the instruments

1279
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:29,710
and and just really enjoyed creating the

1280
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:32,980
music and writing the lyrics and all

1281
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:35,650
that was really fun about regionals I

1282
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:39,660
didn't I did do originals like with my

1283
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:39,660
band I used to have like a ska punk band

1284
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:48,910
back I old-school but yeah I you know

1285
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:51,190
wasn't a thing I probably would still be

1286
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:53,170
doing that but because you love you love

1287
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:55,120
making music I do love it but I think

1288
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:57,910
the bigger thing is I won't have been

1289
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:59,770
forced to try new things right I really

1290
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:02,170
I really do love what I'm doing now and

1291
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:04,090
in fact I think I'm having more fun now

1292
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:07,060
then I would if I was still doing

1293
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:09,430
parodies right now I just really love

1294
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:11,230
this whole like series thing and just

1295
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:12,790
kind of video 2 video kind of continues

1296
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:16,390
and it just keeps going and builds it's

1297
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:19,720
a really cool story so I love what I'm

1298
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:21,760
doing now more than back then but yeah I

1299
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:23,590
think it was the algorithm that kind of

1300
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,790
forced me to like adapt and change and

1301
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:26,950
try things and so you'll see what would

1302
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:29,170
work on YouTube yeah how about you right

1303
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:30,040
what would you be doing um I mean I

1304
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:33,850
think I would be

1305
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:36,040
going back to making the videos that I

1306
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:38,230
was making but taking a longer because I

1307
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:39,790
would do it I mean we would we would

1308
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:41,290
rush a lot of stuff like even the videos

1309
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:43,900
people think are like oh that was so

1310
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:44,980
great that was so you know we put a lot

1311
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:47,440
of time and take like three weeks a

1312
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:47,980
month whatever it's all it always could

1313
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,870
be better

1314
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:51,670
yeah and I'm never there's only a few

1315
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:53,860
times I was very satisfied with how it

1316
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:55,840
turned out and it wasn't completely cuz

1317
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:57,910
it wasn't completely what I thought it's

1318
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,470
gonna be in my head but I mean it's

1319
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:01,420
gotta be realistic and also to YouTube

1320
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:02,620
so you got to post some time but if I

1321
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:04,600
didn't have to worry about that then

1322
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:06,370
yeah I would be on that alright I'm just

1323
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:08,200
gonna make a dope you no matter how long

1324
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:10,320
it takes exactly I'm just gonna make

1325
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:12,640
something crazy hasn't been done

1326
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:14,980
regardless of the time and the right

1327
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:17,020
know viewership falling whatever it is I

1328
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:18,910
would love to do that but I couldn't I

1329
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:20,590
kind of forgot about that demand I mean

1330
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:22,030
I'm doing it now doing five videos a

1331
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:23,860
week but yeah when we did the parodies

1332
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:25,330
we used to spend we actually used to

1333
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:27,040
release like one video every two months

1334
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:28,750
right right and just like put a lot of

1335
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:31,090
effort to perfection get it really good

1336
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:32,860
and yeah that was a thing so app kind of

1337
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:35,050
after the parodies the next thing that I

1338
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:37,690
have evolved into was I created a series

1339
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:39,040
called crap and the goal with it was

1340
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:40,540
like I'm gonna release a video every

1341
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,280
week because what the parodies just

1342
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:44,350
couldn't do it yeah just with just like

1343
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:45,520
me and V it does it couldn't do it once

1344
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:46,930
a week so yeah I'm gonna create a series

1345
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:49,360
called crap because the videos are gonna

1346
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:51,580
be crap compare it to so funny compared

1347
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:53,560
to what they used to be and the crap was

1348
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:55,270
an acronym for comments raps and

1349
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:57,070
parodies so I would take like the

1350
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:59,380
viewers comments and kind of weave it

1351
00:49:57,070 --> 00:50:01,950
into a parody song with like very low

1352
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:07,960
production value right so yeah yep

1353
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:10,150
filler yeah yeah yeah I think um had you

1354
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:11,260
even stuck to doing those like parodies

1355
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:12,370
though I think like you said you would

1356
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:14,080
have got I think you would've got bored

1357
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:15,610
eventually of it and you probably would

1358
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,500
evolved it anyway like you probably

1359
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:19,950
would have moved on to what you're doing

1360
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:23,080
probably or something different yeah

1361
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:24,250
yeah anything you no matter how much you

1362
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,570
love doing it you you actually want to

1363
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:29,160
try something different maybe your

1364
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:29,160
current series will become a musical

1365
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:35,320
musical that's why I don't want doing

1366
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:38,910
musical at all a ninja musical I like

1367
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:40,650
doing music stuff but um yeah that's not

1368
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:43,790
that's not my gift

1369
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:46,830
[Laughter]

1370
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:48,210
what about you wanted what would you be

1371
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:49,500
doing if it weren't the algorithm if it

1372
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:52,380
were the algorithm Al's getting millions

1373
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:54,360
of views man I wanna I just wanna do

1374
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:58,670
videos with Ryan man you know cuz I'm

1375
00:50:54,360 --> 00:51:02,340
hanging out with him Wow yeah I mean

1376
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:05,070
podcasts I like doing these because I

1377
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:06,360
can just be myself put millions of views

1378
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:08,370
yeah that's what I'm saying we could

1379
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:09,450
still do this and get me if we got

1380
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:11,250
millions of views that's like basically

1381
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:12,420
Joe Rogan right yeah you just do a

1382
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:14,640
podcast you just hang out with your

1383
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:17,460
friends and you just get millions of

1384
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:20,520
views and you know like do a three for

1385
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:22,710
our podcast I know the thing is we could

1386
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:24,420
do that is just a Joe so captivate like

1387
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:25,530
he's quick on his feet yeah I think part

1388
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:30,500
of it is cuz he's always hi

1389
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:33,360
I mean he is he's super smart yeah and

1390
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:35,430
the people he brings on are like okay

1391
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:37,770
it's just like the smartest scientist in

1392
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:40,200
the world like yet what's his name

1393
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:41,670
Neil deGrasse Tyson on and that was such

1394
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,570
an interesting one to me because it goes

1395
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:44,820
back to what we were talking about

1396
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:46,020
before about like people who are just I

1397
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:48,870
mean he's a scientist so obvious he has

1398
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:49,320
to say certain things and I found it

1399
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:51,660
interesting

1400
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:55,620
he said yeah this is a hundred percent

1401
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:57,990
there's absolutely no way that we'd let

1402
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:59,040
we didn't land on the moon ever stop

1403
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:02,550
talking about something about when

1404
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:03,690
landing and I was like what but I always

1405
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:05,940
wondered it I don't know if it's true

1406
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:07,290
but like as a scientist isn't it wrong

1407
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:09,780
to say that anything is a hundred

1408
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:11,850
percent yeah like Albert Einstein was

1409
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:14,040
like really confident that this this

1410
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:16,560
whole quantum mechanics thing wasn't a

1411
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,970
thing right but he was wrong exactly so

1412
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,920
confident he could have said 100 with

1413
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:22,680
that like we were saying he's they're

1414
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:25,380
just they're just cocky cocky Letus

1415
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:27,390
elitists yeah there's still that point

1416
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:29,550
something 1% chance you know you never

1417
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:31,080
know you never know so flat or earthers

1418
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:33,260

he's tall and muscular and he always

1458
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:06,820
looked older for his age so he found

1459
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:10,359
pretty good no now you're winning cuz

1460
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:12,280
you look younger yeah so you retain the

1461
00:54:10,359 --> 00:54:15,010
young the young look in the young

1462
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:18,220
viewership and a last question from

1463
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:20,140
Gloria which is what is your favorite TV

1464
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:23,680
show you like and I guess something that

1465
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:25,240
I wanted to add in is like is there a TV

1466
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,920
show from like your younger years or

1467
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:29,950
maybe now that kind of inspires you to

1468
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:32,740
do what you do yeah well you said Ninja

1469
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:34,119
Turtles yeah for inspiring now Ninja

1470
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:35,560
Turtles for sure was probably the

1471
00:54:34,119 --> 00:54:36,820
biggest inspiration for what I'm doing

1472
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:39,850
now and just take a lot of inspiration

1473
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:41,830
from them and as far as little TV shows

1474
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:43,119
I don't watch TV much lately I want to I

1475
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:44,500
can't want to catch up like everyone's

1476
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:46,090
like you got to watch Game of Thrones

1477
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:47,530
I'm like oh man I don't want to get

1478
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:49,000
sucked into that it's gonna be too

1479
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:50,530
time-consuming I don't time for that but

1480
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,869
a lot of time the last show I had

1481
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:54,730
watched that really loved was Breaking

1482
00:54:52,869 --> 00:54:56,770
Bad I suppose who knows amazing yeah

1483
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:58,359
when it was still releasing lie like

1484
00:54:56,770 --> 00:55:00,160
that's how long I think it was probably

1485
00:54:58,359 --> 00:55:01,780
right after they actually know it I

1486
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,940
started watching me like during their

1487
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:05,830
last season so I I kind of got to watch

1488
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:07,880
them all binge style a little bit

1489
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:12,079
without waiting too long

1490
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:13,730
else one fun nice okay well I mean I

1491
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:16,490
guess at some point I was always

1492
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:20,029
wondering - for your for your series and

1493
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:22,819
your channel do you plan to I mean I

1494
00:55:20,029 --> 00:55:24,619
guess it is very like based towards

1495
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:26,180
children like younger people but do you

1496
00:55:24,619 --> 00:55:28,130
plan to like I mean your core fan base

1497
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:29,720
eventually they're gonna grow up yeah

1498
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:31,339
you want to keep it and keep bringing

1499
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:33,500
the younger ones and you viewership and

1500
00:55:31,339 --> 00:55:35,599
replenish the other ones get up or do

1501
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:37,670
you want to evolve the content and go

1502
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:40,309
maybe a little bit edgier well I always

1503
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:42,440
say they keep making new kids so do keep

1504
00:55:40,309 --> 00:55:46,930
making education so you don't need to

1505
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:49,130
know where the with Alabama putting yeah

1506
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:51,200
right you really want us to give you

1507
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:53,119
monetize huh you want to keep going back

1508
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:57,289
to that I know yo Mike that's a really

1509
00:55:53,119 --> 00:56:01,269
good question right yeah I think let's

1510
00:55:57,289 --> 00:56:01,269
go back then let's go back to Chad yeah

1511
00:56:01,809 --> 00:56:05,390
yeah I don't know proud I think

1512
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:08,750
eventually it probably will slowly age

1513
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:10,849
up a little bit kind of like superheroes

1514
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:13,160
