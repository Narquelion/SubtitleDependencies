1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,870

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,100
little different today I mean don't be

00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,540
alarmed don't freak out it's not

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,639
permanent just to get it out of the way

5
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,769
I will address it right now yes

6
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,269
okay I got a new shirt not a big deal

7
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:13,620
next video I'll probably just go back to

8
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:15,089
an old shirt so calm down I'm gonna be

9
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,770
making big changes to my image and not

10
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:19,020
address it okay so now that it's all

11
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,510
cleared up and out of the way back to

12
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,279
the real video so even if you're younger

13
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,230
and not able to vote or you're not from

14
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,519
the US you probably at least still heard

15
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,990
some of the drama behind the whole

16
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,189
presidential election Hillary Clinton

17
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,650
versus Donald trum I'm een it's gotten

18
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,210
pretty crazy and and very hateful over

19
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,829
here if you ask anyone most people

20
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,059
either tell you they hate Trump or they

21
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,469
hate Hillary some people hate both of

22
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,790
them well I like to be a little

23
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:40,440
different and here's something you

24
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,390
probably whenever hear I love both of

25
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,160
them I support Hillary and Donald and I

26
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,300
I just can't decide who I love more I

27
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,010
mean whatever happened to seeing the

28
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,050
glass half-full that's a can cuz we

29
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,879
Americans what you see this whole

30
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,260
election has made everyone so negative

31
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,000
and a big part of it is because the

32
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,199
candidates are so negative towards each

33
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,670
other making all their supporters

34
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,840
negative towards one another as well and

35
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,190
I watched every single one of the

36
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,660
debates when I was watching the final

37
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,670
debate about a week ago I just thought

38
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,339
to myself like these two candidates are

39
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,930
just such equally great and good people

40
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,970
I just wish they could get along I mean

41
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,979
imagine how great our country would be

42
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,630
if a Larry Clinton and Donald Trump got

43
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:14,189
along imagine how much nicer all of

44
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,960
their supporters would be to one another

45
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,299
imagine how we would look at these two

46
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,520
stop spewing hated each other and shared

47
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:32,250
love instead it would be beautiful could

48
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:33,900
you imagine what is this no go ahead

49
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,340
Donald no I'm a gentleman Hillary go

50
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,680
ahead

51
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:40,770
okay can I just say something crazy I

52
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,610
love crazy all my life has been those

53
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:47,330
hear reason or been mine

54
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:49,370
and then to believe I home to me I was

55
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:52,010
thinking the same thing cause like I've

56
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:54,560
been researching my whole life to find

57
00:01:52,010 --> 00:02:02,690
my own place and maybe it's the party

58
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:04,390
talking or teacher found my lousy shame

59
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:07,560
