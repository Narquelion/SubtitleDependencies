00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,470

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:10,679
Parker on parkour Kumar Clark so this is

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,300
probably no definitely the most common D

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,889
Ryan that I get all the time every

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,269
single time I posted your ID video and

7
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:16,830
I've actually done things kind of

8
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:20,189
similar to parkour but I've never

9
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,350
actually really done it because well I I

10
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:26,220
just I don't know how to do it

11
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:28,109
III can't do parkour ever since I was a

12
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,170
little kid I've always dreamt that I

13
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:33,510
would one day learn parkour but you know

14
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,750
no matter how many times I tried over

15
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,520
and over and over again I just just

16
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,739
could never seem to get it you know I

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,110
remember this one obstacle in particular

18
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:45,510
this dinosaur in the middle of the park

19
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,879
was you know the hardest thing I've ever

20
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,590
had to do and I could just never figure

21
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,600
it out I could never get over it I could

22
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,340
never learn parkour if I could not

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,870
defeat this dinosaur I always thought

24
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,910
one day I would I never did and just

25
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,920
made me realize that you know it doesn't

26
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,799
matter how much you want something it

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:10,310
doesn't matter how hard you try some

28
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,310
dreams some dreams just don't come true

29
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:16,410
you know what no forget everything I

30
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,600
said earlier if you have a dream you

31
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,430
chase after it as impossible as it may

32
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,530
seem even if it seems like it's a it'll

33
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,940
take a miracle to get it done miracles

34
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,440
aren't possible at one point it was

35
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,120
considered a miracle that electricity

36
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,860
was possible or America without we could

37
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,720
travel through space even the idea of

38
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,160
the Internet was a miracle and yet we

39
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,419
still accomplished all those because

40
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,729
there's nothing in this world that's

41
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:37,380
impossible till you believe it is so

42
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:39,030
never give up on your dreams because

43
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:43,020
there's no obstacle that you can

44
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:45,650
overcome make a miracle happen defeat

45
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,650
your dinosaur
