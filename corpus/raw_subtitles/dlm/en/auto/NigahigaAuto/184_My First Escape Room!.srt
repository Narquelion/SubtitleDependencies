1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,959
hey guys so I know I'm late to the trend

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,330
as usual I finally did an escape room

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,799
for the first time and because it was my

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,400
first time you can probably already

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,620
guess but I was just kind of awesome I

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,849
don't know like really really good hands

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,740
down one of the best person I've ever

8
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,150
seen play this kind of game sorry I know

9
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,279
I don't want to sound like I'm bragging

10
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,109
but I mean I do have a hundred percent

11
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,000
success rate and I've only done one room

12
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:25,650
so far so like wait till I get some real

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,849
experience under my belt that number is

14
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,140
only gonna go up and then you can even

15
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:29,699
ask the people that I went with who've

16
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,040
actually done escape rooms in the past

17
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:36,780
like just how naturally good I am how

18
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:39,719
great I was for like my first time well

19
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,730
I mean you didn't ask them so but even

20
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,489
then you know you they were like okay

21
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,469
fine I suck okay I suck I suck I'm not

22
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:47,730
good at escape rooms okay and yes it

23
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:49,110
might seem like I'm making a big deal

24
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,550
out of nothing well it is to me because

25
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,410
I always thought I would be good at

26
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,940
escape rooms you know I love puzzles and

27
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,680
riddles and usually good at that stuff I

28
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,300
thought it'd be a natural fit but I

29
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,579
guess I just I don't know I'm just not

30
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:03,809
good at them yes I just some I'm not as

31
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:05,489
smart as I thought I was you know hey

32
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:07,229
this is the part where you guys are

33
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,820
supposed to be like hey come on he

34
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:14,430
wasn't that bad it was your first one

35
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:16,259
you know right look some people's brains

36
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,600
just work in different ways it doesn't

37
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,549
mean I'm stupid okay I'm not dumb look

38
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,320
just because I'm a college dropout and

39
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:23,759
yes I cheated a lot in high school and

40
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,950
middle school to get better grades so I

41
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,750
didn't really retain anything and yeah

42
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,040
okay sure they tested me as a child for

43
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,590
ADHD because I couldn't perform

44
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,119
so-called basic tasks like raising my

45
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,220
hand when I'm supposed to or not paying

46
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,299
attention or not punching a girl in the

47
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,619
stomach for cutting in front of me in

48
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,720
the lunch line even though she saw me

49
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:43,770
there first doesn't mean that I'm dumb

50
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:46,170
okay I just believe that I was there

51
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,909
first Hannah and Hannah if you ever end

52
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,579
up seeing this video for whatever reason

53
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:54,720
I am very very sorry for that

54
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:57,869
kindergarten Mia was just a jerk who was

55
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,219
first so anyway back to the topic one of

56
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:00,810
the worst feelings in the world is

57
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,310
finding out that you know something you

58
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,960
always thought you were good at and

59
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,030
maybe you've some pride in it you're not

60
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,439
only not good you're also the exact

61
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,119
opposite you're bad

62
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,289
and the only feeling worse than that is

63
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,910
when everyone else around you who

64
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,800
thought the same thing of you finds that

65
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,910
out as well people always used to ask me

66
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,349
to go to the escape room they would say

67
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,730
things like Brian you should come with

68
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:18,959
us dude you're not fun yeah you'd be

69
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,610
really good at it I think it'd be really

70
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,140
easy for you to yeah the way you think

71
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,060
outside of the box you'd be perfect for

72
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,099
it come on let's go yeah they said well

73
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,459
if you guys say so I mean I guess I

74
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:31,650
could give it a shot yeah that's kind of

75
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:37,860
why they're not the happiest campers

76
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:39,930
right now so it's not like I wasn't

77
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,640
trying I tried really hard maybe a

78
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,110
little too much to be honest I mean yes

79
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,519
sometimes thinking outside the box is

80
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,349
great for problem solved but I tend to

81
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:47,970
naturally already think outside the box

82
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:48,959
whether I want to or not if you've been

83
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,400
watching this channel long you know if

84
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,660
you probably already know why I would be

85
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,250
so bad at these things make it easier

86
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,629
for those of you that don't this is kind

87
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,190
of what it was like for me and this is

88
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:57,780
not a reenactment of what happened this

89
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,030
is just the kind of things that we're

90
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,470
going on in my mind while the actual

91
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,799
escape room was happening it's probably

92
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:07,049
easier to just watch it take a look okay

93
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:09,180
so one last time as we mentioned early

94
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:11,280
in the prep room we will be watching you

95
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,950
so just to reiterate no phones and

96
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,829
remember the key to escaping this room

97
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:18,269
is in this box and in order to open it

98
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:20,430
you need to figure out the clues leading

99
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:22,470
to it do not try to force this or

100
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,000
anything else in the room open if it's

101
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,290
not opening it's not broken

102
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,810
you just haven't figured it out yet

103
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,220
we've had people break things in the

104
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,109
past out of frustration and

105
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,669
unfortunately we've had to ask them to

106
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:34,440
leave that's not fun for anyone right

107
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:37,290
especially us because then we have to

108
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,730
fix it that's all right well if there's

109
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,730
no other questions I'll be no

110
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:44,130
interesting um what was that you said

111
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,799
the Baqi to escaping this room that

112
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:48,870
we're locked in is in that box yet you

113
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:57,480
know that we know that we have to think

114
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:59,609
outside the box to see into it oh okay

115
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,349
oh hell if there's no other questions

116
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:05,419
for me the timer begins as soon as this

117
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:05,419
door closes good luck and have fun

118
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,359
where do we start oh no I mean she just

119
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:11,500
said this is our way out well look on

120
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:13,000
the box of some writing or something

121
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,260
there's only unlock on here oh that

122
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,049
means we have to find a key of some sort

123
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,130
yeah I'll check the books I got the maps

124
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:19,389
I'll get the Destiny all right there's

125
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,850
definitely gonna be something with his

126
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:29,680
chest with these cups bo does that mean

127
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:38,530
I don't know Ryan why don't you look at

128
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:41,289
the inch right fine right Ryan what are

129
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,940
you doing I think I think I got it got

130
00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:45,190
what I think I figured it out

131
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,630
what like the next clue know how we get

132
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,680
out of this room Ryan you're wasting our

133
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,330
time that's impossible

134
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,620
yeah we just started guys look remember

135
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,300
when she came in here to explain the

136
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,860
rules yeah what about it when she came

137
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,000
in wearing all white I started looking

138
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,009
around the room for all these other

139
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,740
white things and all of a sudden I just

140
00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:01,720
realized all of the walls around us are

141
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,970
white and they're surrounding us like

142
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,560
we're in some kind of institution like

143
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,180
we're in some kind of box and then right

144
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,430
as I was meeting that realization she

145
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,740
goes and picks up another box and and

146
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,990
tries to open it in front of us what is

147
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,409
your point guys call me crazy call it a

148
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,810
hunch

149
00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:19,180
call me maybe but I really think that if

150
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:22,289
we want to get out of this box we have

151
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:26,199
to figure out what's in that box

152
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:29,800
they've been serious yeah why she just

153
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:31,000
told us that Oh see told you we should

154
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,780
have brought him he's gonna slow us down

155
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,699
okay

156
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:35,650
okay she told you guys about the box but

157
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:37,060
in order to get it open I noticed that

158
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,919
there's actually a keyhole

159
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,210
yes we know that's the first thing we

160
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:41,830
talked about that's why we're looking

161
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,060
for hints to find the key actually

162
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,380
that's not what I was gonna say but if

163
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,810
you want to find the key I could

164
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:49,210
actually show you guys will we need help

165
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,409

much time that we haven't found a single

173
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,560
clue yet yeah I got nothing same on the

174
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,639

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,780
huh where do we start well I mean I

183
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,930
would start with the hollowed-out book

184
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:27,310
what the hollowed-out book next to Greg

185
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:29,139
over there you know a third show from

186
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:31,680
the top and the right you have a big

187
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,680
lettering on it

188
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,620
[Music]

189
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:49,810
it should be like some kind of

190
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:51,580
wristwatch or something how did you know

191
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,810
that I mean I could tell you guys but

192
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,550
like you said I don't want to waste

193
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:56,560
everybody's time so okay we were wrong

194
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:58,990
we're sorry yeah yeah just tell us

195
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,340
what's next come on yeah okay well that

196
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,810
hollowed-out book had a watch which

197
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,250
shouldn't be working because when a

198
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:05,470
watch doesn't work you tend to look

199
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,540
we're at a clock which is also not

200
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:08,950
working so it might appear use this

201
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,930
until you see the bottom of the clock

202
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:12,340
which says Made in China probably

203
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,630
wouldn't think too much into that until

204
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,160
you realize that this whole room is

205
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:17,170
covered in maps and one of those Maps

206
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,700
happen to be China now the map of China

207
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,050
has a bunch of different cities circled

208
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,670
but since they provided us with some

209
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:23,320
kind of line graph of some sort with the

210
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:25,510
x-axis being the minutes and the y-axis

211
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,250
being the hours we can assume that they

212
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:29,170
want us to use the x on the broken clock

213
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,490
and the broken watch and basically use

214
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,870
them as coordinates to find our two

215
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:35,020
cities that are most important clock

216
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:36,610
says 3:45 mine says 6:40 it should come

217
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,110
on to Shanghai and Beijing then we take

218
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,700
the broken ruler which is also made in

219
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:41,320
China and measure the distance between

220
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,880
the two and it should come out to about

221
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,110
two inches it doesn't have to be an

222
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,940
exact measurement you just have to know

223
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:48,490
that they're saying two inches they're

224
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:53,950
saying two inches well technically no

225
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:55,570
not two inches two inch s chest oh yeah

226
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:57,070
see those weird colored bottles you

227
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:59,050
found earlier they're all different

228
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:01,060
colors but only two of them in the chest

229
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:04,390
or actually the same colors making the

230
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:06,550
two inch s the only couple just like the

231
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:08,230
cup pulls that Derek was figuring out

232
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,850
earlier and since we now know which

233
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,650
colored cup to pour the liquid into we

234
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:13,510
can follow the tube all the way to our

235
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:15,610
last puzzle the instruments and

236
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:17,530
obviously we all know we only mean piano

237
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:19,630
so we forget about the other one then we

238
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,550
get the shoot music do it what how is it

239
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:23,830
obvious how do we know it's the piano

240
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:28,930
the cups they're labeled PO remember

241
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:30,160
peel what P o P and old piano you think

242
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,720
I can't explain that one

243
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,280
okay fine but it still doesn't explain

244
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,510
why you think it's the last puzzle I

245
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,490
mean we knew from the very beginning

246
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:39,680
that we're looking for keys right what

247
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:41,629
has more keys than a piano

248
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,089
hey guys there's there's a note in here

249
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:46,339
just says to find the key you must play

250
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:48,350
the keys using all the keys that led you

251
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:50,540
here in the correct order all the keys

252
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,399
that led you here correct order what

253
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:55,009
does that mean

254
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:57,009
the clues things that led us here the

255
00:08:55,009 --> 00:09:02,179
book was the first one oh that's right

256
00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:03,769
yeah it's empty on the spine there's a

257
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:05,149
big egg yeah yeah that's how you knew

258
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:07,939
where to start and that thing stands out

259
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:17,470
more than a big a plane a key what else

260
00:09:07,939 --> 00:09:25,189
we have um there's a G in here the G a

261
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:27,829
another egg is that it no nothing

262
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:29,899
happened that was the last clue it led

263
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:32,089
us to the piano all right yeah but maybe

264
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:39,189
try it again but all together all right

265
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:39,189
so the order was a G F G a a

266
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,360
doesn't it sound like mary had a little

267
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,360
bit

268
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:57,230
[Music]

269
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:10,290
[Music]

270
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:12,570
I don't know how you did it but I'm

271
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:19,710
impressed well there's only one last

272
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:22,220
thing to do not man you do it you

273
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,220
deserve it

274
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:34,400
okay what the hell why would you do that

275
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,200
we have the key well you need to swallow

276
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,930
fine now you guys still don't get it huh

277
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:45,080
what look there was never a key in the

278
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:52,760
box to begin with congratulations you

279
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:54,140
guys set a new record from the very

280
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,150
beginning she mentioned that the key

281
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,280
tore escape was in the box

282
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:01,190
she didn't say there was actually a key

283
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,570
in the box the box was the key why when

284
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:04,460
I asked her about thinking outside the

285
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:06,110
box she gave me that weird look remember

286
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,270
people don't usually pick up on that so

287
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:10,160
fast well I did know something was up

288
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:11,450
but I wasn't like absolutely positive

289
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,770
that I had to break it yet you know

290
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:14,180
because it was two of the rules like

291
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,770
don't break things and don't use phones

292
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,480
then I started noticing all the random

293
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:19,250
phones in the room and I realized maybe

294
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,260
were supposed to break the rule but even

295
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,990
then I wasn't absolutely sure until I

296
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:28,940
saw the broken ruler exactly broken rule

297
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:31,370
alert clever rule no this is the

298
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,870
stupidest escape room ever hey it's okay

299
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:34,730
man some people just don't know how to

300
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,560
think outside the box some people just

301
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:38,360
can't break the rule they just do what

302
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,940
they're told and you know what we call

303
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,940
those people sheep

304
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:53,070
[Applause]

305
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:54,269
yeah you already know it didn't happen

306
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,860
that way like I said this was kind of

307
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:57,420
the fantasy version that was actually

308
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,680
going on my head during the escape I'll

309
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,910
try to make all these connections and

310
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,410
make things work I was overthinking

311
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,399
everything this was just to show you the

312
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,779
kind of things that were going on in my

313
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,740
head while the other guys were doing the

314
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:06,600
real work if you want to see how the

315
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,670
escape room actually was in real life I

316
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,040
uploaded a blog on Higa TV it's just

317
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:12,570
like a real tiny bit more accurate and

318
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,100
realistic than the one that you just saw

319
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,600
although I will say just thinking about

320
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,890
the escape room and writing that skit

321
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,600
you know the one you just saw I actually

322
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:21,089
think I developed a technique that will

323
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,800
help you or even experience escapers how

324
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:24,600
to get out of any escape room pretty

325
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,610
much with the same success rate as me

326
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,990
100% I'm not just talking in a fantasy

327
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,670
I'm talking reality because in reality

328
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:32,790
that other version would look a little

329
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:41,790
bit more like this nah man you do it you

330
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:42,540
deserve it okay what the hell why would

331
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,370
you do that

332
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,140
we have the key Paul you need to swallow

333
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:47,670
fine now you guys still don't get it huh

334
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:50,160
what why don't you guys take a closer

335
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:58,620
look there was never any key in the box

336
00:12:50,160 --> 00:13:01,770
to begin with are you serious I just

337
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,329
that mean we win oh hey I'm sorry but

338
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:06,810
I'm gonna have to ask all of you to

339
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:10,860
leave right now oh okay and it's the

340
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:13,100
hell Ryan's you you did yeah I do you

341
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,100
want
