00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
hey guys so I watch a lot of scary

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,650
movies now and honestly I used to hate

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,089
them when I was younger but then I

4
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,950
started making videos and realize how

5
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:09,150
fake they are now I actually enjoy them

6
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,320
but I'm not gonna lie in the back of my

7
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,210
mind whenever I'm watching horror movies

8
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,679
I want to get scared but you know I'm

9
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,240
thinking of all these other random

10
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,529
scenarios of how the movie could have

11
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,810
went instead just like every single

12
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:21,630
October I go on a horror movie watching

13
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,100
spring horror not horror hold or Moodle

14
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,660
but majority of the time I can't just

15
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,010
ruin the movie for myself instead of

16
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,330
just sitting there and falling into the

17
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,830
story of the movie I'm always looking

18
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,210
for other things like how do they make

19
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,920
that how did they do that effect make

20
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,329
those costumes mother how long that

21
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,559
person interested in makeup I bet this

22
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:35,880
is what's gonna happen I still don't

23
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,230
know what the Fox says the thing that

24
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,520
ruins it the most for me is that when

25
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,230
I'm watching these movies I'm always

26
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,399
thinking of other scenarios of how the

27
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,390
movie could have won and because I've

28
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,250
been watching so many horror movies

29
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,840
lately I've been jotting all these ideas

30
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,340
down on my phone and that's why this

31
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,809
video is created so for all of you who

32
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,100
watch horror movie thank me I'm sorry I

33
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:51,480
don't mean to ruin the movie for you

34
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,949
guys well on the bright side for all of

35
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,750
you people who hate scary movies and

36
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:56,160
can't watch them hopefully you can watch

37
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,539
this video and it'll ruin the horror

38
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,100
movies for you the same way it does for

39
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,809
me so with that being said this is what

40
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,379
horror movies would be like if they

41
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:03,379
weren't scary
