00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,790

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,319
why do I look like a complete nerd right

3
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,819
now it's the shirt I probably look like

4
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,649
one of those losers that stays home all

5
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:09,269
day and reads all night and doesn't have

6
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:11,759
a girlfriend it spends all his time

7
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:13,259
online on the computer well you're wrong

8
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,370
cuz I don't read no a lot you guys don't

9
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,929
know this especially if you don't watch

10
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,789
my second channel without my glasses or

11
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:20,160
contacts my vision is pretty much poorer

12
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,570
I mean I'm almost legally blind what did

13
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,369
you call me no blind

14
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,930
I said legally blind not blonde that's

15
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,430
not what I heard don't be stomping your

16
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,640
lessons and prada shoes that mija it's

17
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,560
not even product it's Louis Vuitton what

18
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,920
are you blind or something yes love that

19
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,510
movie

20
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,070
anyway I'm wearing my glasses because I

21
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,110
can't wear my contacts for about a week

22
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:41,579
and the reason for that is because I am

23
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:45,260
going to be having eyeball surgery what

24
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,260
that was terrible here trying to get

25
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:51,600
that's better it's really not that bit

26
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,980
supposed to be a really safe procedure

27
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,420
I've always been really careful about

28
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,190
protecting my eyes I mean think about

29
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,539
your eyeballs are so important and yet

30
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,680
there's nothing really protecting it

31
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,390
other than your eyelids yes these are

32
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,470
the joke of the body protection

33
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:08,130
committee what a muscle well bone look

34
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:11,340
at eyelid till they're all flimsy and my

35
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,140
pupil science shows right comes with the

36
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,700
glasses like I said I've always been

37
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,049
really protective over my I mean I wear

38
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,670
sunglasses all the time like when I

39
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,229
Drive when I'm by the pool when I'm

40
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,080
wearing sunglasses even when I'm indoors

41
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:23,700
douche I can't take my eyes in every

42
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,960
scenario even in a situation that you

43
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,030
would never think about kissing a girl

44
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,950
with a pointy nose I don't have a pointy

45
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,950
nose yeah I love you

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,340
doosh the only time I let my guard down

47
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:42,710
and I'm not proud of it but I broke

48
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,710
probably the biggest I rule of all time

49
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:50,790
come on keep up and that's the last time

50
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,259
I ever win running with scissors but

51
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,060
overall how can I lie I know it's a

52
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:55,619
common procedure but there's always that

53
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,210
one thought in my head like what did

54
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,500
they mess up and I go blind what if I

55
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,790
want to wear glasses again I don't want

56
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,080
to be a hipster and what about all the

57
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,140
memories all the memories with these

58
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:07,100
terrible eyes I mean I'll never be able

59
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,100
to see this way again

60
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,930
okay yeah I need the surgery it's gonna

61
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:18,580
happen in about a week whether I'm

62
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,430
afraid that it might go horribly wrong

63
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:23,560
or not so I guess there's just one last

64
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,360
thing I have to do it's not easy for me

65
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,950

66
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,260

67
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,910

69
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:35,230
whole new way but this surgery is gonna

70
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:37,510
