1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:06,390
it's at the awkward stage again jail no

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,589
jail no GL no wax no wax wax off what

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,480
hey guys so if you guys haven't already

4
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:11,010
noticed switch I don't think you have

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,660
because it's only been like five seconds

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,830
into the video I got a new chair I got

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,450
it for free but I don't worry this is

8
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,850
not a product placement I just they sent

9
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,050
me an rhpc a bunch of free chairs so

10
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,760
just give them a shout out thank you

11
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,070
guys so much thank you to the whole

12
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,510
means that DX DX Racer I just butchered

13
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,039
their name don't take the chairs back

14
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,810
please I like it if you guys didn't

15
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,250
notice my chair was always squeaking and

16
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,269
ruining takes and all my other vlogs I

17
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,590
don't know why it took me this long to

18
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:32,759
get a new chair especially since I used

19
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,110
this problem into every video it's not

20
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,820
perfect - it's like art it's like the

21
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,440
channel colors in fact I technically

22
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,850
didn't even get permission from them to

23
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,050
use their brand in this video so

24
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,410
technically I think they can get it

25
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,360
removed

26
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,489
I should probably cover that up with

27
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,629
some funny pun joke you guys haven't

28
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:47,460
noticed we always trying to cover brands

29
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:48,660
up in case they get mad which they have

30
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,250
in the past for some reason I don't know

31
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,199
why free promotion you know cover up

32
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:58,039
other brands these super clever puns

33
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:58,039
such as and of course now

34
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,430

35
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,989

36
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,240

cheap comedy it's really not that funny

99
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:42,760
it's just silly and dumb and I'm already

100
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,320
trying to stray away from doing all fun

101
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,240

shots and that was already really

124
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,170
