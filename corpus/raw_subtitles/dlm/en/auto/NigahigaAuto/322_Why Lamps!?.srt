00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,389
hey guys so let me first off this video

3
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,920
by saying we recently reached a goal

4
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:06,569
that seven years ago I never even

5
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,120
thought was possible for me at least and

6
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:11,360
this goal just so happens to be drumroll

7
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,360
please

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,020
hello can't give you a drumroll if you

9
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,880
have the drumsticks yeah but that's for

10
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,230
dessert I want the drum roll only have

11
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:28,560
the sticks for the drum you have the

12
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:31,830
drum roll sticks tastes like bad pun we

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:35,579
just reached 10 million subscribers know

14
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:38,430
what's gonna clean this up oh it was

15
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,170
just editing anyway on a serious note

16
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,640
thank you guys so much I know I used to

17
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,469
make a thank you video after every 1

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,210
million subscribers and I haven't made

19
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:46,410
one since the 6 million subscriber video

20
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,270
but the reason for that is because those

21
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,320
videos never get many views so I figured

22
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,520
you guys don't like to watch them

23
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,420
because they're not that interesting but

24
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,710
it doesn't mean that I'm any less

25
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,180
grateful for all the love and support

26
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,829
that you guys show me I know I always

27
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,120
say I have the best fans in the world

28
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:58,620
but the more I think about it you guys

29
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,539
are more than just fans to me you're

30
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,920

31
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,799
