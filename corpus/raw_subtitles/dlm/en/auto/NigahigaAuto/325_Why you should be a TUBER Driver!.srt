1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
do you enjoy picking up random strangers

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,680
in your car are you struggling to find a

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,940
job or perhaps you just want to make

4
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,649
extra cash did you get to keep a

5
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,809
fraction of do you wear way too much

6
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:12,889
cologne well then tuber driving could be

7
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:12,889
the perfect job for you

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,860
being at uber driver could set you for

9
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,980
life our studies show that the average

10
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,450
tuber driver makes $20 an hour $20

11
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,220
that's five dollars more than Bernie

12
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,840
Sanders makes or something like that of

13
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,550
course for every dollar you make you

14
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,990
have to pay your share to tuber because

15
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,770
I mean we are the ones doing all the

16
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,879
work after all

17
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,530
and you'll have to pay for your own gas

18
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:36,940
that's your problem not ours and you do

19
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,050
have to use your own personal car and

20
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,790
we're not responsible for car

21
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,320
depreciation and not to mention taxes

22
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,850
that's on YouTube oh and also there are

23
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,500
some minor expenses that you have to

24
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,030
take care of as well at tuber we do

25
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,830
require all of our drivers to provide at

26
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,690
least two Fiji waters gum an iPhone

27
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,830
charger for every single ride but the

28
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,239
iPhone charger can be the one with the

29
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,940
shortest cord so it's actually a lot

30
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,589
cheaper than you think

31
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,360
here at uber we're all about quality and

32
00:00:56,589 --> 00:01:00,220
safety for our customers is why we

33
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,930
perform extensive background checks on

34
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,159
all of our drivers all you have to do is

35
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,080
send in a picture of yourself and our

36
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:06,490
team scans the entire background for

37
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,930
anything bad and if they don't find

38
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,340
anything you pass the background check

39
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,810
welcome to tube or you're a driver

40
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,369
once you become a driver the next step

41
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,260
is to choose your style of drive there's

42
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:15,490
so many different styles to choose from

43
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,900
you just have to find the style that

44
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,850
fits you bet for example we have the

45
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,260
classic personal driver who's that one

46
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,610

47
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,810

48
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,730

the I just watched a fast and furious

78
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:34,650
movie driver driver who thinks he

79
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,870
doesn't need navigation I've been on the

80
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,310
street before must have moved it

81
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,960
somewhere the driver who doesn't know

82
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,030
how to use navigation do you know how to

83
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,100
get back to the navigation is it the one

84
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,930
says camera and the driver who only

85
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,550
listens to navigation my house is coming

86
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,860
up right here

87
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,110
oh we just passed it nope GPS says we

88
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,490
got six more miles and so much more the

89
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,140
possibilities are endless

90
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,459
speaking of different styles uber offers

91
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,780
a bunch of different kind of tubers that

92
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:59,670
people can order so for all of our

93
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,840
drivers you can choose which kind of to

94
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,950
where you drive just like our

95
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,980
competitors we have all the original

96
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,720
options tuber XL to 4x and tour black

97
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,950
but we did modify them a little bit to

98
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,900
make us more original rather than

99
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,130
meaning extra large tuber XL now stands

100
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,300
for extra little and this is for all

101
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,950
your drivers out there who have a lot of

102
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,780
stuff in your car so you can only fit

103
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,489
extra little passengers not really sure

104
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,350
what X stands for for our competitors

105
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,580
but with tuber and you choose 2 bar X

106
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,200
you're only going to be picking up your

107
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,580
X's which is perfect for all your

108
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,170
drivers out there who already camp

109
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,760
outside of your ex's house because if

110
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,320
they call you you're already there the

111
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,940
black option actually seen the low -

112
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,830
edgy for us so we actually called it

113
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,120
tuber wannabe black and this option

114
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,890
comes with a little ghetto Asian girl

115
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,780
