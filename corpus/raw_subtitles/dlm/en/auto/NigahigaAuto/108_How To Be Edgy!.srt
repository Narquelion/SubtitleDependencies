I went back home to Hawaii for the

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,490
holidays and I had a lot of time to

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,839
really reflect on myself like most

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,130

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,480

13
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,359
clean I mean not like Disney Channel

actually break a real laptop anyway for

151
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,710

was serious look the truth is I am

156
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,180
getting older and usually with people in

157
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:45,740
the entertainment industry as they get

158
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,539
older they intentionally trying to get

159
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,039
edgy or so that they can appeal to an

160
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:50,330
older audience and honestly I just I

161
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,280
don't want to do that look if my stuff

162
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,539
gets edged ear over time because I'm

163
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,250
getting older that's fine but I'm not

164
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:56,690
gonna force it just to appeal to a new

165
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,460
audience I'm not getting edgy I'm not

166
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,599
really changing my image in fact because

167
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,039

168
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:02,449
