you're in very deep thought all the time

106
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,530
so that everything you say even if it

107
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,210
doesn't make sense

108
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:52,670
sounds like it's very deep and dramatic

109
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:54,860
sometimes you got to go back to actually

110
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:57,290
move forward I don't mean that like some

111
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,360
fancy metaphor I mean literally when you

112
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,980
crash into one of those big old green

113
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,290
tube things in Mario car

114
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,060
gotta press B in reverse a little and

115
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:07,250
then you can keep going and even though

116
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,740
I know all that still have so many

117
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:12,530
unanswered questions like they named the

what it was like in New York City of

121
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:21,380

122
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:23,270
is the meaning of life cereal

123
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,340

124
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:28,820
healthiest cereal round is just there

125
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:31,420

00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,340
with really good effects so you're

185
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,020
saying the Machine fell in mouths

186
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,930
volcano and it's gonna erupt at any

187
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:25,030
second yes and I'm afraid this time it's

188
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:28,920
not just gonna be molten lava erupting

189
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,920
what else is there lasers

190
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:37,550
Laser volcano only on sci-fi so you're

191
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,709
saying all the animals had been sucked

192
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,870
into the sky yes and I'm afraid this

193
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:43,669
time when the storm hits it's not just

194
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:49,330
gonna be rain what do you mean it's

195
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:49,330
literally gonna rain cats and dogs

196
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,490
the rain of cats and dogs only on sci-fi

197
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,140
so you're saying a tornado that's

198
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:01,140
forming in the ocean is heading towards

199
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:03,030
us yes and I'm afraid this tornado is so

200
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,190
big that it's gonna suck up man-eating

201
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:11,790
sharks so it won't just be a normal

202
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:14,040
tornado it's gonna be a sharknado only

203
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,660
wait if a tornado is forming in the

204
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,820
ocean isn't that just a hurricane no I

205
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:20,550
mean tornadoes can form over water too

206
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,290
right not sure I know hurricanes do and

207
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,760
should we just call it shark hurricane

208
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,260
yeah but that doesn't sound as good as

209
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,430
sharknado yeah but I mean just to be

210
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,050
safe I think we're thinking too much

211
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:30,090
into it yeah this is the sci-fi Network

212
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:34,350
we don't have to know real science for

213
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:35,940
this right sci-fi or science may not be

214
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:39,690
accurate but at least we have good

215
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:41,610
effects so I know what you're saying I

216
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,900
was nothing like all those actors Act in

217
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,800
fact that wasn't even good acting that's

218
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,300
because you're used to seeing these

219
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,740
people in movies and if we were to put

220
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,900
all the stuff you just saw in the form

221
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,660
of a movie see how perfect the acting

222
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:54,360
actually was sometimes you got to go

223
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,340
back to actually move forward even

224
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,080
though I know all that still have so

225
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,590
many unanswered questions what does it

226
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,480
even matter

227
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:05,460
no okay well dress the monkey yes coach

228
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,440
