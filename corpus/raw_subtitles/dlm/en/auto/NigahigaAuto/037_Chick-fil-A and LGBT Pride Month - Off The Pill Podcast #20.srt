life right now I know exactly why

David's this way why is because your

112
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,960
soul David is so like hesitant review on

113
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,780
the podcast now since he's since the

114
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,430
first podcast so he's afraid of things I

115
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,020
mean that's gonna get him like I'm a bad

116
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:22,330
comment I'm afraid of people

117
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,880
I know Internet you've changed you

118
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:26,590
afraid of internet people Internet could

119
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,490
you imagine what the world would be like

120
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,780
if Olson and the internet was gone now

121
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,460
what the world would be like at the

122
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:35,470
internet lism yeah if it suddenly just

123
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,919
disappeared I think life would be great

124
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:40,780
and it wouldn't be great how so is it

125
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:43,720
because like you couldn't just watch any

126
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:47,530

127
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:50,470

130
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,949
realistically I think a lot of people

131
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:59,139
would be to like become depressed I

132
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:01,659
really think like people are super

133
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:05,050
addicted to the Internet I think I am

134
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:06,550
right I think most of us are but there's

135
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,620
some people especially kids growing up

who only know the Internet life who are

137
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,570

185
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:03,910
a jug with me and I made sure to drink

186
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:05,350
like at least half of the jug so I'm

187
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,600
pretty healthy person except for the

188
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:09,610
fact that I eat like fried foods every

189
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,640

but just to sorry we change the subject

193
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,580
three times in this short segment but to

194
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,380
change it up again because we are doing

195
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,940
something different I would like to

196
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,860
announce and this is our 20th episode

197
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:32,229
we're gonna change up this podcast a

198
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,820
little bit and even more so thanks to

199
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:35,670
people like Skillshare people who

200
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,580
sponsored this so we can finally afford

201
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:41,260
we're opening up another podcast Natalie

202
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:43,440
yeah oh I was waiting for it is that

203
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,440
play

204
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:53,590
that doesn't fit hold on you're about to

205
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:53,590
get me opening up another podcast in LA

206
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:59,510
[Music]

207
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:01,100
so why are you guys opening uh what I

208
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,690
mean it was always kind of the plan if

209
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,990
once we could afford it things to

210
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:07,820
sponsors and stuff but because most of

211
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:10,160
our I mean I thought I could get guests

212
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:13,940
out here everyone we know is in LA

213
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,440
there's very few hot here and yeah I

214
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,150
think I want to change that up a little

215
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,520
bit and also this is supposed to be

216
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:21,740
temporary this room is very small yeah

217
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,260
looks big on camera though it does

218
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,370
surprisingly but it's it's not yeah I

219
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:28,160
can't wait for all the equipment to

220
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:30,440
leave so I can finally move in what yeah

221
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:44,210
this is my room in your part of the

222
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:46,760
house yeah anyway speaking of changes

223
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:48,590
though what we wanted to do is try out

224
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,780
these new segments kind of like shows I

225
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:52,820
guess within the podcast kind of

226
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:54,380
inspired off you know what you like

227
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,880
radio stations to do right they have

228
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,800
like a little like sometimes they do

229
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,570
pranks and sometimes they do like no

230
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,070
games and stuff so we have a few little

231
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,300
games that we wanted to try out who

232
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:04,250
knows if you guys don't like it we

233
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,020
probably won't do it but we have fun

234
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:09,800
doing it so we're gonna try out this new

235
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:15,380
game that we made up called don't dudes

236
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:16,850
the bit where we supposed to say we

237
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:19,250
didn't actually plan this out we just

238
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:21,380
made it up before before this like in

239
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:26,570
the kitchen so I say clearly three to

240
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:34,700
one should make yeah I think let's cut

241
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:37,070
to a graphic right sorry well we'll

242
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,960
improve it Paco explain the rules for

243
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:42,740
dumb dude dumb dude's debate it's hard

244
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:45,620
to say true not that different debate is

245
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:50,020
about basically you have two options of

246
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:53,900
a either goofy topic or more serious and

247
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:55,880
two dumb dudes have to debate it one

248
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,649
person gets to pick which side they

249
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,509
and then the other person has the

250
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:01,699
leftover side no matter if you believe

251
00:10:59,509 --> 00:11:04,730
in that or not you must support it with

252
00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:07,790
any sort of logic or just do your best

253
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:09,259
logic best yeah but wait should it be

254
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,730
like you get to choose which side you

255
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:12,829
want or should like someone else I know

256
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:14,300
whoever's like the middle - I can is

257
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:15,920
I'll just try I don't want to do this

258
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,660

259
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,819
gonna have to do this guy's already we

260
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,560

261
00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:23,899
you guys Lee can I give you as a topic

262
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,850
okay I'm dudes debate all right let's

263
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:29,209
just start one because okay here we go

264
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:34,009
so I'm gonna start off with should dance

265
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:37,100
be considered a sport I want Paco to say

266
00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:40,579
that it should not be okay I believe it

267
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:42,740
Ryan to say already I want Ryan to see

268
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:45,470
you know wait wait no I want Ryan to

269
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:48,620
believe yeah say that you do support it

270
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:49,160
okay okay you don't sir Paco doesn't

271
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,720
support it

272
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,130
Ryan supports it and I wish I had more

273
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,649
time to think about this who should be

274
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:56,600
considered this sport maybe Paco can go

275
00:11:54,649 --> 00:12:00,439
first then they should not be a sport

276
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:02,329
there's no ball involved okay start with

277
00:12:00,439 --> 00:12:03,560
something okay it's fine but there's a

278
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:04,850
lot of sports that don't have a ball

279
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,970
involved like well unless you're gonna

280
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:13,370
make a joke wrestling is a sport women's

281
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:13,550
wrestling is a sport I agree so but you

282
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,930
know

283
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,550
so you're saying every sport needs to

284
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,769
have a ball involved well swimming more

285
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:20,420
likely it's a sport there's water polo

286
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:22,819
and if you can water polo yeah but

287
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:26,120
swimming in it and therefore it requires

288
00:12:22,819 --> 00:12:28,130
balls but swimming itself that's a sport

289
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,350
yeah yeah yeah your arguments invalid

290
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:32,569
I'm talking about most sports most

291
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,310
sports need balls alright okay we're

292
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:36,170
gonna move on to dance dance is more of

293
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:39,050
an art - it's more of an expression you

294
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:41,449
can dance with balls no yes you can't

295
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:43,009
dance with balls but even if you could

296
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:44,959
dance the balls how are you supposed to

297
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:46,790
score it like I think what makes a sport

298
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,649
if you're doing a school okay so tell me

299
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:51,350
this then tell me this when people do

300
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:52,699
ballerina or when they do uh like those

301
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:55,130
talent shows and they hold up numbers

302
00:12:52,699 --> 00:12:57,259
yeah they were symbols well regardless

303
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:59,000
they do that right hmm that's a score

304
00:12:57,259 --> 00:13:01,250
but it's also it's based off

305
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,290
technicalities also losing Kelly I'm

306
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:05,630
using all the a letís mmm that's what

307
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:07,040
dance is most fatality cuz I'm going to

308
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,750
kill it with this topic right here go

309
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,000
ahead

310
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:15,290
it's known that even in those words

311
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,050
judges are biased only for all sports

312
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:20,000
judges are biased don't Reaser bias - in

313
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:21,889
basketball yeah but it's very difficult

314
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,509
when there's a actual physical score

315
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:27,019
that you can see progressing throughout

316
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:28,430
the game I don't know tomorrow but I

317
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:30,290
don't know if I said I don't know we set

318
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:31,670
a time it we probably should do that in

319
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:35,000
the future because I don't we could go

320
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:37,939
on for days based on what we just talked

321
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,529
about who won this debate in your

322
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:42,980
opinion I'm or the time I'm gonna base

323
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:45,889
it off of passion which is which doesn't

324
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,480
really mean anything well I like passion

325
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:56,720
passion I think for this particular

326
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:59,209
round I'm gonna give it to Paco you have

327
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,870
three points yeah okay the points don't

328
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:04,189
matter just like in yes okay I got

329
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,870
another one okay how about this one

330
00:14:04,189 --> 00:14:07,790
first of all wait all the dancers are

331
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:09,410
gonna handle a hate on no but that's but

332
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:11,180
that's the point is you don't have to

333
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:12,649
actually believe it but you have to

334
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,389
argue it they're trying to make it

335
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:19,069
delicious they're trying to make it in

336
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:20,750
the Olympics you do believe it huh I

00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:26,610
anywhere anywhere and they'll just be

365
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:28,920

367
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,810
sure also you know they teach you

368
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:36,390
real-life interactions and that

369
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:37,650
brain-dead like dogs dogs will just come

370
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,640
up to you and show you love no matter

371
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:40,290
what okay

372
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,850
sometimes a Catholic I don't really want

373
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,380
to talk to you that's like how humans

374
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,570
are man it teaches you you know the ebb

375
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:47,130
and flow did you hang of relation you

376
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,750
think having cats is a learning

377
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:50,520
experience that's why people get pets

378
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,440
people don't get pets because they they

379
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,150
want to learn about life they get pets

380
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,060
well you can learn that from dogs as

381
00:15:54,150 --> 00:16:00,180
well but you get pets because for well

382
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:02,040
for one you know you can't use a what is

383
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:04,440
it blind blind eye cat there's no blind

384
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,270
eye cat so there's actually real uses

385
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,680
for dogs right there's actually uses for

386
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:10,020
dogs you can also use dogs to smell out

387
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,820
drugs cash can do that there's real uses

388
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,250
and then there's also like you said the

389
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:18,750
loving side the reason the most people

390
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:20,430
get dogs because they want love cats

391
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,720

cats but there are okay I'll give you

416
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:25,589
this there are blogs that I kill people

417
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:28,530
then there are cats who kill people very

418
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:30,929
true but let's say that you know you

419
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:32,910
need those dogs to kill people let's say

420
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:35,620
they're helping protect people like

421
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:38,200
those canines that work for the police

422
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,370
you might need that too are you there

423
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,870
are they trained to kill I thought

424
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:43,299
they're just trained to me well they are

425
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:46,059
trained and they're trainable you can't

426
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:52,299
train a cat to do that you can train a

427
00:17:46,059 --> 00:18:00,640
tiger can you Siegfried and Roy believe

428
00:17:52,299 --> 00:18:04,029
we got yeah what this debate is over and

429
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:07,470
you wanted the cats I think it's dope I

430
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:09,130
think it's over no disrespect to any cat

431
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:12,370
owners out there

432
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:14,020
I am personally am a fan of dogs but

433
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:15,730
it's a lot of I know for others that it

434
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:19,289
might be offended I like cats man cats

435
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:21,850
are cool I like cats - I also like dogs

436
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:23,230
but I like dogs more I think I like cats

437
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,120
is because they're more just like just

438
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:26,710
super chill about a lot of things so you

439
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,480
like them because they're easy to take

440
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:31,000
care of because you're lazy well no I I

441
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,039
would want a dog - yeah but he had to

442
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,210
pick yeah would you like this is this

443
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,470
outside of the debate which if you had

444
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:37,390
to pick would you rather have a dog okay

445
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:38,799
I think you would want a cat because

446
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:40,600
it's easier to take care not to say I

447
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,000
would want a dog I think I know because

448
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,350
you would want a dog but like I think

449
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,710
you would enjoy a cat because it's so

450
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:48,730
easy yeah but then I would fit but and I

451
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,830
want a dog because like you said they

452
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:53,080
just blindly give love yeah that's all I

453
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:55,690
want man all people want different pets

454
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:58,120
yes we take the best part yeah if a cat

455
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:59,799
starts you know I'm not all cats like my

456
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,809
cat was actually like wasn't my cat my

457
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:03,640
brothers cat was actually like really

458
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:05,649
loving cuz it grew up with three other

459
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,299
dogs I think that's why but it would

460
00:19:05,649 --> 00:19:09,640
come to you let you pet it but I've seen

461
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:11,409
cats that just you go to reach for it

462
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,299
and just runs away or they claw you yeah

463
00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:14,649
they claw you thank you I got again

464
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:17,440
there's there's some dogs that do that

465
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:18,880
but most times not yeah well that's that

466
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,980
concludes these I thought we already

467
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,320
concluded we will yeah I guess it

468
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:26,080
concludes the the topic of dogs and cats

469
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,909
I think the winner of this debate I'm

470
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,470

really have another one though yeah I

483
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:04,220
did I did um what is what is the most

484
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:09,890
salad

485
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:12,679
what fruit salad or potato salad come up

486
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:19,670
with this what is the most salad I don't

487
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:21,590
even know right right uh try to argue it

488
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:23,750
this is hard this is a hard one are they

489
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,590
so this just because we don't have any

490
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,570
rules in this game

491
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,710
let's all just argue this right now okay

492
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:29,270
someone pick it doesn't matter because

493
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:32,330
this is your random one did you make

494
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:34,610
this up no found online yeah what is

495
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:37,460
salad what is the more so it is most

496
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:40,130
salad yeah fruit salad or potato so what

497
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:43,400
about macaroni salad sure that could be

498
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:45,290
one of all the options to salad what is

499
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,970
the fruits what I'm trusting sure a bowl

500
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:49,580
over fruit and then and then potato

501
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:52,010
salad is I tell you the Mayo and potato

502
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,690
yeah not just that there's other

503
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:56,540
ingredients what is more salad they're

504
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:58,340
both equally not salads yeah but you

505
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:01,520
have to pick one I'm gonna go with

506
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,660
potato okay I'll explain why I would go

507
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,720
with potato as well but all right I'll

508
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:07,880
go fruit then yeah then I think the

509
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,070
variety of a fruit salad is too much

510
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,990
when you think of your traditional salad

511
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:13,700
it's it's all green and it's all lettuce

512
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:15,740
for the most part as a lie and a half

513
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:17,840
we'll go ahead what else you got I think

514
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:21,200
there needs to be a vein you ever heard

515
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,830
of a chef's salad that thing is all over

516
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,090
the place never has every piece of

517
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:28,010
culture everywhere they got ham

518
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:29,929
they got egg they got cheese they got

519
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:31,850
olives they got dressing pick whatever

520
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:33,920
dressing you the lon whatever chef you

521
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:35,720
want dude he can bake what and he like

522
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,250
you want balsamic vinaigrette with ranch

523
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,130
that's a weird combination but you can

524
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:41,240
have that chef's salad all right mmm so

525
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,920
that's a lot of mixture

526
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,200
what about fruit so we got fruits from

527
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,179
around the world different things things

528
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,170
to spice up your taste buds all right

529
00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:50,510
what are you gonna get oh is that

530
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:52,880
watermelon is that cantaloupe or is that

531
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:54,260
a turkey in terms of water you when you

532
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,850
think salad I'm being real technically

533
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:57,500
you're thinking real like when people

534
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,940
think salads right you think lettuce and

535
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,130
or whatever like there's different stuff

536
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,730
in it and dressing okay they're dressing

537
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,890

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,870
salad I mean potato salad has a dressing

543
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:17,120
in itself already right well let's

544
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:19,040
define what a salad is like that most

545
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,080
people think about it's just lettuce and

546
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,000
all there's a lot of things it's lettuce

547
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,350
right there's no lettuce you could and

548
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,690
you could add other things

549
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:29,090
ya know but the main ingredient it's one

550
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:30,560
main ingredients your point yeah it's

551
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:33,980
one main ingredient not a bunch of rent

552
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:37,790
equally among both is is there a potato

553
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:40,010
in most salads no is there there fruit

554
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:42,350
in most sell it yes

555
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:43,910
tomatoes tomatoes is what there are

556
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:45,530
tomatoes so there's we're already

557
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:50,720
invading the salad we're pretty much

558
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:52,130
half the salad Moses a dumb one this is

559
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,460
a real argument that people looked up

560
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:57,830
yeah salad we're already also present

561
00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:00,140
their song called berry vinaigrette dude

562
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:01,730
that's a dressing true and we put the

563
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:04,550
dressing on the salad we already put the

564
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:05,930
fruity sweet sup with the salad that's

565
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,670
the salad baby I think there needs to be

566
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:11,380
one main ingredient in his salad potato

567
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:14,840
salad is potato normal salad is lettuce

568
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:16,790
macaroni salad is macaroni nobody puts a

569
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:19,160
salad there's macaroni as well there's

570
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:21,400
more macaroni than there's potatoes so

571
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,930
the so if I have to choose between

572
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,950
potato salad in a fruit salad I would go

573
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:25,960
with potato salad because there's one

574
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:28,460
main ingredient

575
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:31,910
you can't moderate and pick for your own

576
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:33,140
side dude I'm moderating this one I

577
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,789
thought no I thought we were all

578
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:42,659
debating yes you're gonna debate

579
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:45,269
I moderate this and I say you guys are

580
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:48,330
equally dumb we're even talking about

581
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:49,440
this I think it's a stupid one I think

582
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:51,809
this is stupider than the other stupid

583
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:56,759
ones that we have this is the dumbest

584
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:58,109
one I mean why the segment's because I

585
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:00,179
don't I don't get it yeah we're dumb

586
00:23:58,109 --> 00:24:03,239
guys dumb dudes debate damn one of those

587
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:07,590
dumb dudes do two dumb debates that's a

588
00:24:03,239 --> 00:24:09,359
lot of dumb dudes do tend to play just

589
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:15,509
don't do to dumb debates while

590
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:17,340
doo-dooing we could we use the outro

591
00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:20,309
thing to cut off cut us off at any point

592
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:22,109
so but also uh if you guys have any

593
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:26,220
other suggestions for dumb dudes

594
00:24:22,109 --> 00:24:28,470
debate leave them in the comments below

595
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:31,799
or if you wants to stop doing this show

596
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:32,999
within the podcast please say bit

597
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:35,249
outside of that we'll keep it in the

598
00:24:32,999 --> 00:24:37,679
kitchen where we normally do anyway save

599
00:24:35,249 --> 00:24:40,859
save save on the show yeah let's get

600
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,389
back to just being us yeah like that

601
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:44,669
that was justice being us though that

602
00:24:42,389 --> 00:24:48,840
kind of we'd already do like kinda way

603
00:24:44,669 --> 00:24:50,849
we just formed it into a show um but

604
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,859
it's fun it's fun to do stuff like that

605
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:56,340
is pretty fun yeah we do do that though

606
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:57,299
yeah I kind of feel lost now I don't

607
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,340
know what to talk about I think we

608
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:01,529
should be fighting over something that's

609
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:04,799
mom we talked a little bit about the

610
00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:07,409

00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:35,429
bit more and we're gonna get some

624
00:25:32,729 --> 00:25:40,259
already have a lot of people who are

625
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:41,639
willing to be on the show name have to

626
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:44,460
do it you don't have to do when I go out

627
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:46,529
there a whole tour of people's podcast

628
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,940
so I always say like alright when I come

629
00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:49,320
to LA then

630
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,940
through the pot there's so many I have

631
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,799
to do are you doing them all in one day

632
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:54,809
I don't think this possible is only

633
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,850
traffic right it's not possible these

634
00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:58,379
podcasts are like hour to two hours long

635
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:00,659
there's some podcast though that I'm

636
00:25:58,379 --> 00:26:04,409
like a little intimidated by like what

637
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:07,559
like Ethan's podcast mmm

638
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:09,990
83 yeah they get their fans are very

639
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:11,639
like they're vicious harsh they will

640
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:14,070
destroy you yeah that's why I'm like I

641
00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:16,500
don't I feel like David on here like I

642
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:18,389
feel like I have to be that's why I mean

643
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,519
to you because I'm getting you ready oh

644
00:26:18,389 --> 00:26:21,899
is that why you're harsh critiques yeah

645
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:24,899
I'm definitely shaving for that one

646
00:26:21,899 --> 00:26:25,950
definitely I don't want people make fun

647
00:26:24,899 --> 00:26:28,019
of me you know what they're does but

648
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:30,389
there's not much controversy from your

649
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:31,710
side thank mean they don't they don't

650
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:33,990
they usually have guests that are

651
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:36,000
controversial in essence not always but

652
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:38,820
the comments are just kind of harsh on

653
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,019
that podcast yeah another one somebody

654
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:42,179
keeps asking me they're like you know

655
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:43,830
life it's not somebody people keep

656
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:47,159
asking me like oh what Paquette like

657
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:48,419
what podcast would you want to do and I

658
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:50,129
don't want to do the ones that I listen

659
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:52,679
to because it's like man that's

660
00:26:50,129 --> 00:26:54,629
intimidating you know like Paula Rogan

661
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:57,120
Joe Rogan I would never do that I would

662
00:26:54,629 --> 00:26:59,549
I mean that would be an honor but no

663
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,830
it's great what I've heard about his

664
00:26:59,549 --> 00:27:05,669
podcast like he's had like like famous

665
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:07,139
people on it Mike Tyson like but he only

666
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:08,340
interviews people that he's interested

667
00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:10,440
in yeah yeah

668
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,870
so could you imagine if you asked like

669
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,429
hey I want to be on the podcast he's

670
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:16,289
like I'm not interested in you I would

671
00:27:14,429 --> 00:27:17,730
now I hate you hard no not at all I

672
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:19,320
would make no real sense cuz I'd be like

673
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:22,169
what would we talk about his pockets are

674
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,250

00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,250
it's not

723
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:51,990
I realized it wasn't you know as it was

724
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:54,660
opposed by a lot of my gay friends and

725
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:56,280
they were very upset I don't really know

726
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,929
what it was about I thought it was just

727
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:01,620
like people trolling I assume is people

728
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:02,850
trolling right nope knowing well I know

729
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:05,760
it's a real thing but they're trolling

730
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:06,840
like they're obviously like what what

731
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,559

00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,650

isn't that the majority of people do use

00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:20,330
more straight people and it's more

738
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,340
socially acceptable that's the whole

739
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:25,610

we know just come on cause Gary dude

757
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,429
straight straight Pride Parade is not

758
00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:12,320
gonna be it's one of the gay pride

759
00:31:10,429 --> 00:31:13,940
parade if you think about it what is

760
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,049
that even do you even look into this are

761
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:18,230
we just talking about nothing what do

762
00:31:15,049 --> 00:31:20,299
you do I'm like well I mean so what is a

763
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:23,630
Gay Pride per well gay pride parade is a

764
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:27,019
place where like homosexuals go and they

765
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:29,179
celebrate and their diversity and raise

766
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:32,240
awareness and they have colorful Flags

767
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:35,179
and way too much glitter and maybe you

768
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,820
know a lot of touching and high-fiving I

769
00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:40,279
would assume straight pride parades have

770
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:42,470
to be the opposite of that what would

771
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:46,039
that look what is the opposite black and

772
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:48,049
white flags that's it welcome to shades

773
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:51,500
of grey different yeah it would be the

774
00:31:48,049 --> 00:31:53,210
the gay pride parade flag but just like

775
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,919
without any color like you put a black

776
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:58,010
and white filter on it I wonder why the

777
00:31:54,919 --> 00:32:00,139
rainbow became the sign of gay yeah

778
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:03,740
that's good one as you know in Hawaii we

779
00:32:00,139 --> 00:32:05,659
are our like uh-1 or like our college

780
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:07,490
team is closing the ring we wore the

781
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:09,049
rainbow where the Rainbow Warriors we

782
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:10,460
were just the rainbows at Fir oh yeah we

783
00:32:09,049 --> 00:32:11,480
were the rainbow were just a rainbow and

784
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,679
then it became because it's white

785
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,940
there's a lot of rainbows right makes

786
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:17,049
sense and then it just became this like

787
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:19,820
gay symbol and well now we're just the

788
00:32:17,049 --> 00:32:20,929
four years really the Warriors but you

789
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,940
still got people throwing Rainbow

790
00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:26,450
Warriors that's where we were yeah so

791
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:28,350
maybe Hawaii's homophobic hmm or were

792
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:30,330
the Rainbow Warriors so

793
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:34,260
hawaii's fighting for gay pride could be

794
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:35,640
that's here yeah yeah well I just I

795
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:38,160
don't know I don't see what the rainbow

796
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,600
has to do with gay yeah I'm just I'm

797
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,340
just curious ya know there's probably a

798
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,169
reason that's a great question I I don't

799
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,190
I don't even know ya what do you think

800
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:46,679
it means that you think it means like

801
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:48,030
just accepting every color yeah more of

802
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:49,799
a race or like it could be like a

803
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:50,820
diversity thing you know like I like

804
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:54,240
roses

805
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:55,770
rainbows should be like for I'm against

806
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,110
racism because I like yes color

807
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:59,669
absolutely versus so so what would the

808
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:01,950
gate we're like changing the simple

809
00:32:59,669 --> 00:33:04,289
about what would the gate like if we had

810
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:06,270
to make a new flag right that represents

811
00:33:04,289 --> 00:33:08,970
like I think for yeah well I'm not a

812
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:11,460
racist straight men make a flag but

813
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:13,409
we're using logic like we're literally

814
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:16,620
saying I accept every color and it makes

815
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:19,110
sense right if you're not racist yeah so

816
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:21,570
how would you wouldn't you want to with

817
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:23,640
the same colors yeah I mean that's true

818
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:26,610
actually like I'd like a maybe like a

819
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:29,549
pink and a red versus or like a yellow

820
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:32,490
in a orange like pink pink something

821
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:34,080
blue so no like yeah traditional not be

822
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:36,419
were gonna say oh so you're assigning

823
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,780
colors to maybe that's why they didn't

824
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:45,179
you so they could stay away from that

825
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:47,880
hmm and that was PC this out the week

826
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:50,309
damn you didn't do like a synchronized

827
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:52,710
in do anything do it go be seeing it

828
00:33:50,309 --> 00:33:55,409
softly he's a singer so you like

829
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:58,230
imitates really well mm-hmm but um my

830
00:33:55,409 --> 00:34:00,030
topic at her I'm actually really I like

831
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:01,260
kind of can you look that up real quick

832
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:03,630
cuz I'm actually really curious what the

833
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:06,570
how did the rainbow become a symbol of

834
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:08,119
gay yeah it is right like it is it's I'm

835
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:10,859
not like just

836
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:13,649
otherwise they all just like got

837
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:14,820
together and just real smart about their

838
00:34:13,649 --> 00:34:16,530
branding yeah

839
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,480
you know what I found the answer here

840
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:20,369
what says the rainbow flag was

841
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,869
popularized as a symbol of the gay

842
00:34:20,369 --> 00:34:26,190
community by San Francisco artist

843
00:34:21,869 --> 00:34:28,050
Gilbert Baker in 1978 and know that no

844
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:29,850
because he actually has a collaboration

845
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:30,240
with Nike for their shoes coming out

846
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,700
okay

847
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:35,070
the be true selection guy okay so some

848
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:37,409
guy did that but why like why what does

849
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:39,179
it mean the different colors are often

850
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:41,740
associated with diversity

851
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:44,589
yeah it's like a community

852
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:48,369
but actually have literal meanings oh

853
00:34:44,589 --> 00:34:50,320
look into those literal meanings I think

854
00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:51,700
you think URIs mother said I am I was

855
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,589
wondering yeah what does it have to do

856
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:55,060
it just became a common like common

857
00:34:53,589 --> 00:34:59,170
knowledge if the run was a success eh

858
00:34:55,060 --> 00:35:04,030
mm-hmm right the lgbtq probably one in

859
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:06,790
78 sorry red life orange healing yellow

860
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:10,060
sunlight green nature blue harmony peace

861
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:11,500
and purple violet spirit it sounds like

862
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:13,599
you're just naming things that sound

863
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:16,180
like the color yeah so what does that do

864
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,760
with a movement though you know what we

865
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:20,830
should probably add 74 head no word

866
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,960
Baker did come on the show because well

867
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:25,270
we could yeah you know if he comes on

868
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,770
though ask him if we can get some those

869
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:28,510
be true shoes though they're pretty

870
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:30,970
clean dude they weren't she's really

871
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:32,320
nice be true what is it he true I

872
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:34,869
believe that's what's called be true

873
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,210
it's a collection that he does with Nike

874
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:39,240
and I think I think every year they're

875
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:42,180
having a release during this month

876
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:46,089
they're dope how do you guys feel about

877
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:49,720
this is kinda edgy oh honey how do you

878
00:35:46,089 --> 00:35:50,859
guys feel about when you would I mean

879
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,020

880
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:54,970

881
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:58,810

chick-fil-a too but there's some

886
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:05,920
articles that I read and I'm like and I

887
00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:08,140
feel so guilty

888
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,240
well let me sum is I don't more recently

889
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:12,400
like how do I make up for that so that I

890
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,990
can still hey you know more recently I

891
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,670
heard that chick will actually donated a

892
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:17,260
lot of money like to the you know

893
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:22,240
there's that big shooting in the club

894
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:22,510
and yeah long time ago but they did well

895
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,450
they do

896
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:29,980
they did donate argue that that's kind

897
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:31,210
of a PR thing right cuz I mean they had

898
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,770
that reputation right the whole the

899
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:33,880
whole drama there for people who don't

900
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:37,450
know it's because they're a Christian

901
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:38,859
company and I guess in the what what is

902
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:40,750
the whole drama there there's a lot of

903
00:36:38,859 --> 00:36:42,460
drama there but I'm not exactly sure

904
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:44,950
what incidents it was that they

905
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:48,130
supported Christian organizations that

906
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:49,780
support anti-gay laws right something

907
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:51,160
like that probably I that too and also

908
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:53,550
just like the way that they said

909
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,119
traditional traditional marriages right

910
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:56,859
so the

911
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,289
so I understand that and obviously like

912
00:36:56,859 --> 00:37:01,630
if I'm you know I've been in a situation

913
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:06,099
where I was we were trying to figure out

914
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:09,430
what to eat and I was with a gay guy and

915
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:10,839
he like we all decided let's go

916
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:15,249
chick-fil-a he really really felt

917
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:17,589
strongly so we didn't right yeah and I

918
00:37:15,249 --> 00:37:19,210
don't mind that but and I think that's

919
00:37:17,589 --> 00:37:21,490
right and I think that's fine that we

920
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:23,769
still wanted it but like we didn't go

921
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:25,329
because out of respect but is it still

922
00:37:23,769 --> 00:37:26,980
wrong because I read articles that make

923
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:29,769
you just feel like a novel person is it

924
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:31,329
still wrong to go to chick-fil-a on your

925
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:32,799
own because you're supporting something

926
00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:34,960
that doesn't support like your friends

927
00:37:32,799 --> 00:37:37,509
are like you know I've read articles

928
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,339
that make me stay I see they're like I

929
00:37:37,509 --> 00:37:41,200
don't go there all the time but like I

930
00:37:39,339 --> 00:37:42,519
like I like the food you know like I

931
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,309
can't I'm not gonna pretend like I don't

932
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:48,609
but am i supporting something by going

933
00:37:45,309 --> 00:37:49,930
there do I'm saying like yeah for sure

934
00:37:48,609 --> 00:37:51,430
it was kind of like the whole like thing

935
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:53,369
we talked about me being not being

936
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:56,170
vegetarian even though I feel bad for

937
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:58,440
you know how all animals are slaughtered

938
00:37:56,170 --> 00:38:01,210
and stuff it's it's a selfishness yeah

939
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:03,309
the vegetarian one is a little bit more

940
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:05,289
understanding that's because Gabe Gay

941
00:38:03,309 --> 00:38:06,789
Pride Month it's a little hard to say

942
00:38:05,289 --> 00:38:09,789
that but I'm not gonna I'm gonna be

943
00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:11,289
honest like I like their products yeah I

944
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:12,849
mean I was gonna come in agreeance with

945
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,710
that like when you tie it into the whole

946
00:38:12,849 --> 00:38:15,940
like vegan or vegetarian thing but

947
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:17,440
that's what I'm trying to say it's like

948
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:18,819
I read those articles like last year

949
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,140
when that happened and like I was like

950
00:38:18,819 --> 00:38:23,019
yeah this makes sense I'm just not gonna

951
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:24,640
eat there I don't need to but then I you

952
00:38:23,019 --> 00:38:26,289
know I used sometimes a whole year goes

953
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:29,230
by I know you kind of crave sometimes

954
00:38:26,289 --> 00:38:30,700
and yeah I know I went there and I have

955
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:33,549
gay friends and I have respect them and

956
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:34,989
I understand it you feel like I'm not

957
00:38:33,549 --> 00:38:37,089
trying to sit like I'll still support

958
00:38:34,989 --> 00:38:38,230
them but like I don't I don't know there

959
00:38:37,089 --> 00:38:39,670
are also a lot of agree with the

960
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:41,289
correlation yeah there are also a lot of

961
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:43,029
gay people who do still go to

962
00:38:41,289 --> 00:38:45,160
chick-fil-a I know there are but I'm

963
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:47,710
talking about the huge amount of people

964
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:49,029
who will be really mad at me even saying

965
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:54,099
this ball so I'm a question I have a

966
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:57,630
question how much of my spicy chicken

967
00:38:54,099 --> 00:39:02,799
deluxe meal is going towards gay hate

968
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:05,619
how much if you could get an yeah of how

969
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:07,839
much hate you're contributing what would

970
00:39:05,619 --> 00:39:08,100
that affect you what if it was fractions

971
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,050
of

972
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:12,450
penny oh but it's still that's the

973
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:14,370
principle right is the principle it's a

974
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:17,640
principle but what if there was a dollar

975
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:19,170
amount do you think that would make

976
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,730
people gonna be like oh maybe I

977
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:22,770
shouldn't oh sure

978
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:24,270
you know do this or would you think

979
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:27,360
people are like oh it's fractions of a

980
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:29,430
penny you know or like what they could

981
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:31,680
do right hear me out

982
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:33,180
you have if I know what the value is

983
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,160
right they find out what that fraction

984
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:39,030
of a penny is right yeah and you say

985
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:42,900
they offer you hey would you like to add

986
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:45,510
pay an extra dollar to support gay gay

987
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:47,490
rights and equality it would never do

988
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:48,840
this but they say okay I'm going to

989
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:52,460
chick-fil-a I'm gonna donate $1 to

990
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:54,830
support equal rights for gay people

991
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:58,890
that's just to make myself feel better

992
00:39:54,830 --> 00:40:00,720
dude what make you that would be I think

993
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:01,950
a organisation really cool with that cuz

994
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,570
in there getting something not they

995
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:05,970
would have never got it like yeah out of

996
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:08,010
guilt in their movement like they're

997
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:09,480
like you know I like Salvation Army yeah

998
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:10,680
whatever yeah they're outside they're

999
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,730
ringing the bells or people who are like

1000
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:14,190
save the whales they have you sign a

1001
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:15,600
petition so like people ask you like how

1002
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,980
many times have you had chick-fil-a this

1003
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,420
year and then you tell oh yeah so you

1004
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:21,990
can do that and then you don't have that

1005
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:24,120
guilt exactly now I think organizations

1006
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:25,830
should think about it because there's a

1007
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:28,170
lot of people like me I think who really

1008
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:31,230
like their products and don't wanna you

1009
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:33,420
know yeah upset that community yeah and

1010
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,840
then you be like well this everybody

1011
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:36,270
wins

1012
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:39,630
mm-hmm they get my money and you get my

1013
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:41,520
money and I get my food those delicious

1014
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:47,520
I don't know what I really went well I

1015
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:51,090
think we're gonna get I like chick-fil-a

1016
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:53,700
I I love I know you I think they're

1017
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:56,280
really the service is great you know

1018
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:58,320
it's it's hard yeah they're one of the

1019
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,520
nicest like the workers yeah the best

1020
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,660
you know I know there's a bunch of

1021
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,950
towards the towards the like the

1022
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:06,570
co-founders and yet a company but the

1023
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:07,680
people who work there are literally like

1024
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:09,570
have you ever been there they're like

1025
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,560
the nicest they're trained to be though

1026
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:11,910
yeah they're supposed to be that way

1027
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,010
yeah what's they have to say something

1028
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:15,750
all the time

1029
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:17,130
they even oh they say my pleasure my

1030
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,690
pleasure instead of like you're welcome

1031
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:20,440
because they're there to serve people

1032
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:22,210
and and have

1033
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,290
yeah no faster there's like really like

1034
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:25,450
small things like that that just make

1035
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:27,040
you feel like oh nice nice P some people

1036
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:29,380
in relationships don't even hear that

1037
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,790
yeah I think I think everyone should be

1038
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:33,210
able to eat wherever they choose to

1039
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:35,950
whatever the organization believes

1040
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:38,080
because it's its food but it doesn't

1041
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:39,760
mean you don't leave in it right it you

1042
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,680
are supporting it is what the articles

1043
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,620
yeah I write are saying but you know

1044
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,900
I've also seen like in because I go to

1045
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:49,000
the the chick-fil-a in Hollywood I see a

1046
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:51,130
lot of gay people there too I do too I

1047
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,870
even saw a before they're all gay Pia is

1048
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:56,050
here's the thing like nobody really

1049
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:58,390
knows what the companies generally stand

1050
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:59,860
for in general like for example we don't

1051
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:03,790
know if the manufacturer of this table

1052
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:06,580
right now is like a racist a racist or

1053
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:10,000
if there's a person who you know some

1054
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:11,980
supports gay marriage or doesn't support

1055
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,240
we don't know these things for majority

1056
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:15,370
of the products that we use in this

1057
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:17,440
world I guess the the question is like

1058
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:20,290
if you're if you know that they do that

1059
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,210
is it bad to support even if it is a

1060
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:24,340
great product you know and I think

1061
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:25,990
people should still be able I mean

1062
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:27,730
people should just make that choice for

1063
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:28,510
themselves you know and shouldn't judge

1064
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:31,270
if someone else

1065
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:33,040
I have chooses to like but there's gonna

1066
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:35,020
be there that's exactly the point there

1067
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,700
a lot of people are being very much so

1068
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:38,590
judged especially gay people then they

1069
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:40,480
should they're like oh yeah that like

1070
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:42,730
how dare you yeah like this is going

1071
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,200
against what you are and I mean it's it

1072
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:46,180
was actually the article is more

1073
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:48,400
targeted towards gay people who go to

1074
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:50,230
chick-fil-a and people who support equal

1075
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,970
rights like the act like active people

1076
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:53,710
who still go there yeah

1077
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:55,360
and they made a very compelling are I

1078
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:56,530
don't know what where that article was

1079
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,090
from yeah there's it there was a couple

1080
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:59,830
because it's you know gay pride ones but

1081
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:03,130
I mean look if me if I found out that

1082
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:07,840
McDonald's promotes Wars or like putting

1083
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:10,360
sends money to terrorists it'd be really

1084
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:12,460
hard for me to not eat filet-o-fish when

1085
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:14,110
I'm craving it but when you say supports

1086
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:16,600
you know Wars and stuff like we'd have

1087
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:17,410
to see what exactly have they done yeah

1088
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,630
like is it

1089
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:21,790
oh they support like like nobody's gonna

1090
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:23,110
support I support war you know there has

1091
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:24,700
to have some like even when you're when

1092
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:26,410
they're supporting their religion yeah

1093
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:29,290
and it just so happens that their

1094
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:30,640
religion has that clause and you know

1095
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:33,490
like it's not like there's trying to

1096
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,780
support I just don't like gay people

1097
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:36,369
or a certain type of people it's because

1098
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:37,690
it's in the religions whatever they

1099
00:43:36,369 --> 00:43:39,310
believe I don't think any like

1100
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:41,380
McDonald's be like hey I support war

1101
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:43,060
unless it's like in the religion or

1102
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:45,030
simply did right right but what I'm

1103
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:47,920
saying is it's not like they're just

1104
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:50,710
supporting that for that reason I don't

1105
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,619
think anybody does things just for the

1106
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:55,420
fact of like hate right it's because of

1107
00:43:53,619 --> 00:43:56,920
what they it might be hateful but I

1108
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:58,990
don't think they intentionally do things

1109
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:01,090
to like be hateful yeah I don't think

1110
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:03,090
it's more often I think the the

1111
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:05,890
protection of their own beliefs and

1112
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:07,710
values or their rights type of thing or

1113
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:10,450
their like it's a lot of times like oh

1114
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:12,580
like people just being selfish because

1115
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:14,619
they're worried about oh how is this

1116
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:18,430
gonna affect me you know so a lot of

1117
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:20,800
times like when a smaller minority group

1118
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:23,290
who's been oppressed when they're like

1119
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:26,310
trying to raise awareness or ask for

1120
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:29,410
equality a lot of times the higher

1121
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:31,450
higher groups in quotes you know will be

1122
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:34,000
worried because they're like oh well our

1123
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:38,320
privileges or our lifestyle have to

1124
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:40,540
change you know and in the it's in the

1125
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:43,869
same way we're like if this is gonna be

1126
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:47,650
a stretch of a metaphor but in the same

1127
00:44:43,869 --> 00:44:50,020
way with divorce how women wall is if

1128
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:52,960
they're married to a successful in rich

1129
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:55,210
man and when they get divorced the the

1130
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,430
money that they get paid they get paid a

1131
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:58,540
lot more because they're used to the

1132
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:59,800
lifestyle you know

1133
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:01,630
that's what they say the argument is

1134
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:05,080
used to the lifestyle so a lot of times

1135
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:07,480
that in that same aspect the the people

1136
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:09,100
who are in power they're worried like oh

1137
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,869
well I have to adjust my lifestyle you

1138
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:14,670
know and how am I good how am I gonna be

1139
00:45:10,869 --> 00:45:18,450
used to this new movement this new wave

1140
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:25,180
so that was our topic on chick-fil-a

1141
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:30,240
happy I just thought it was interesting

1142
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:34,240
you know I thought guilty I'm sorry I

1143
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:36,250
have to say I'm sorry no support eat

1144
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,230
right you want yeah I support equal

1145
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:40,720
rights but I don't I don't feel like

1146
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:42,700
even if I if they have enough money

1147
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,930
right those foundations what do they

1148
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,130
really what can they really do I guess

1149
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:45,520
they can change laws that's what they

1150
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:47,200
can do

1151
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,869
but I don't really know I don't know

1152
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,869
what

1153
00:45:47,869 --> 00:45:52,580
like I don't know enough I don't know

1154
00:45:50,869 --> 00:45:55,550
the truth I'm just hearing one

1155
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:57,170
perspective to person like I mean I'm

1156
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:59,720
hearing the perspective of gay people

1157
00:45:57,170 --> 00:46:01,850
yeah who are mad at me for going there

1158
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,990
not me specifically but us I don't know

1159
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:04,460
I think there will be a lot of gay

1160
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:06,020
people who are okay with you going to

1161
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:08,750
chick Floyd because there's a lot but I

1162
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:10,340
mean there's a very huge majority and

1163
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:12,500
articles like that cuz I read it and I

1164
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:14,869
was like I can go there by the time I

1165
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:17,930
finished reading it I was like oh man

1166
00:46:14,869 --> 00:46:19,609
people this is compelling like I I don't

1167
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:26,390
need to go there and then throughout the

1168
00:46:19,609 --> 00:46:29,510
year I was like there all the time don't

1169
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:30,950
worship the place no it's just a chicken

1170
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:33,109
sandwich come on

1171
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:34,930
I know just a simple some people are

1172
00:46:33,109 --> 00:46:36,230
just saying would like to get upset I

1173
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:38,240
get it

1174
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:41,090
I get I get their reasoning I get their

1175
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:42,380
reasoning going just get it to a topic

1176
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:51,230
that's not gonna get us in trouble

1177
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:52,850
should we go to check for this okay

1178
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:55,040
let's get let's change topic this wasn't

1179
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:57,770
a heart I know I know but you know what

1180
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:01,820
I'm laughs I like talking about this

1181
00:46:57,770 --> 00:47:03,770
because it's interesting it is other

1182
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:05,030
people relate to it no no yeah because

1183
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:06,890
it's a cop it's a it's a thought that

1184
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:08,810
people have people only may not voice it

1185
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:10,520
because they're worried like oh if I say

1186
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:12,350
this does it make me a bad person

1187
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,940
I think it's a common thought to have

1188
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:15,080
like Oh will I offend people see what

1189
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:17,060
they're having is what I think too is

1190
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:18,290
like a lot of people might have that

1191
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:21,350
thought but once they read that article

1192
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:23,690
and they see the majority they see what

1193
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:26,480
most people find like what's the easiest

1194
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:27,830
way to not upset people there they trick

1195
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,690
themselves to being like I'm not gonna

1196
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:31,630
think twice if this is right there's no

1197
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:34,220
right or wrong like this is what's right

1198
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:36,140
I'm saying that it isn't or it is I'm

1199
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:37,580
just saying people there's a lot of

1200
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:40,460
people I think who don't even think

1201
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:43,190
twice they just follow what's exactly

1202
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:45,020
like if that was a less common opinion I

1203
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:46,520
think it would be the opposite like if

1204
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:48,770
people like to go with what's working

1205
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:52,970
and what gets you

1206
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:56,330
I guess less hate some people like

1207
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:58,580
getting more hate I don't know where I'm

1208
00:47:56,330 --> 00:48:01,790
going with that

1209
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:04,490
hhor-- pinion i think it what's

1210
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:08,720
beautiful is that Lyman has it of their

1211
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:10,820
own have their own beliefs values and

1212
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:16,370
you're trying to not get hate comments

1213
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:17,690
you're trying to do all right I eat a

1214
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:19,430
chick flick all the time I actually went

1215
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:20,300
there last week did you really I did

1216
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:21,980
yeah Wow

1217
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,420
you know what you should do those but it

1218
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:25,040
doesn't make me a bad horse what about

1219
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:26,480
this what about this yeah kind of going

1220
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,160
back to what we said maybe there's a

1221
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,690
sale you donate load that who will say

1222
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,950
that you are a bad person for going last

1223
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:32,900
week you know what those people are

1224
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:34,790
whacked how about if not let's

1225
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,800
compromise okay it's it's Gay Pride

1226
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:39,620
Month I will not go there for the month

1227
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:42,020
of June mmm I don't even go every month

1228
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:43,730
so that's not even how about this how

1229
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:45,590
about someone how about someone in the

1230
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:47,590
gay community create something better

1231
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:49,940
than chick-fil-a and all yes exactly

1232
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:51,530
that's difficult all I care about is

1233
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:53,390
having a good chicken set is true and if

1234
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:55,730
it tastes good I'm gonna go or what they

1235
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:57,260
chick-fil-a should do well I guess their

1236
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:58,550
whole thing is like based on religion in

1237
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:00,590
principle they should just bring in like

1238
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:13,190
a gay CEO but he would they would never

1239
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:15,320
do that yeah Wow so hateful something

1240
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:16,040
that would not get us into trouble for a

1241
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:18,410
change

1242
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:20,330

00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:21,760
