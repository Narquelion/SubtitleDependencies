1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,780
hey guys so today I'm gonna be talking

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:05,069
about girls feminists to be exact and if

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,649
you don't know what a feminist is they

4
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:09,360
are girls who are very Pro girls

5
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:12,540
and when I say Pro girls I don't mean

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,610
like lesbians or professional girl or

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,170
talking about girls who seek equality

8
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,430
between men and women actually wrote

9
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,810
this video a long time ago but I never

10
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,070
filmed it because I thought feminists

11
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,840
would be offended oh you think just

12
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,730
because we're girls we can't handle a

13
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,630
joke what no I never said that why do

14
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,670
you have to make the girl character

15
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,109
stupid well I have guy characters just

16
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,720
as stupid as you oh so now you're

17
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:32,099
calling me stupid ha yes then I thought

18
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,020
to myself there's no reason they should

19
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:35,850
be offended I'm all for equal rights

20
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,170
between men and women I agree that women

21
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,399
should get paid the same amount as a man

22
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,690
if they're doing the same job and a

23
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,579
woman should not be looked down on by a

24
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,110
man but if you want equality everything

25
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,329
has to be equal not just certain things

26
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,739
guys want equality too for example why

27
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:48,090
is it traditional for a guy to open a

28
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,590
girl's door but a girl never does it for

29
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,300
a guy why is it customary for guys to

30
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,719
have to risk rejection and ask out girls

31
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,699
all the time

32
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,930
girls hardly ever ask old guys wise and

33
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:56,399
gentlemanlike for a guy to pay for a

34
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,109
meal don't say it's so sweet when guys

35
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,270
bring them gifts and flowers and candies

36
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:01,500
and what do we get a free hug and why is

37
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,180
it that there's a girls day but when it

38
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,320
comes to boys it's Children's Day I'm

39
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,280
not saying that I want all of these

40
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,750
things it's just that if you're talking

41
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,220
about equality you're basically asking

42
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,780
us to treat you like a dude which we

43
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,310
would love to do if it were acceptable

44
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,810
one of the most popular complaints from

45
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,400
girls is that guys don't spend enough

46
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,810
time with their girlfriends well when

47
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,450
you think about it it goes both ways

48
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,909
that's what he said see what I did there

49
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,189
equality come on I don't wanna watch you

50
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,170
play video games all day why don't you

51
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:27,210
spend some time with me pull up a

52
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,040
controller there's two of them but I

53
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,360
don't like my video game and I don't

54
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,640
like shopping well you know what I'm a

55
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,320
girl I want attention and I'm a guy I

56
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,820
want another complaint that girls always

57
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,380
have is that guys are all shallow and

58
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,939
they only care about sex and how girls

59
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,650
bodies look then why is it okay for

60
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:42,270
girls to say it dear Ryan can you

61
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,280
introduce your abs to us less than three

62
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,290
and then if we say dear girl take your

63
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,820
shirt off it's offensive girls are just

64
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,119
as bad as guys it's just that they get

65
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,079
more offended girl you got a nice boobs

66
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:54,960
could you imagine if guys were that

67
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,250
sensitive oh I like your muscles my

68
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,020
point is that it doesn't matter if

69
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,159
you're a male or a female so again don't

70
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,600
think that I hate feminists because

71
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,520
that's not true at all I'm just raising

72
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,200
a point that both sexes have positives

73
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,909
and negatives so stop complaining about

74
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,069
the other sex and just love yourself for

75
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:11,370
who you are nobody's perfect stand up do

76
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:13,050
