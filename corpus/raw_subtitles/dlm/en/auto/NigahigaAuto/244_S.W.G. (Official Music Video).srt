00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,030
I cannot believe this video has over a

2
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,290
hundred million views there's just a

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,269
bunch of girls shaking their booties

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,920
well that's exactly why it's girls

5
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,570
shaking their booties come on that's my

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,100
point that's what all these songs and

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,810
music videos are about these days that's

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,580
all guys want to see I mean not all guys

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,310
I personally would rather see a nice

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,750
sweet innocent girl for a change than a

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,400
girl who's the acting like a stripper

12
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,900
there's never going to be because

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,489
rappers don't want to rap about that

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,739
stuff what you want in a girl is like

15
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:37,700
the opposite of every rap song well then

16
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:41,960
I guess that leaves us with no choice

17
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,960
we'll just have to make our own rap song
