00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,210
just got back from China he has been

32
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,470
gone you haven't been in a video for a

33
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,270
long time it's been like a month month

34
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,880
and a half or so yeah but Derek was in

35
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:33,240
China dancing for the Jabbawockeez yeah

36
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,759
it was fun I basically took a small leap

37
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,460
from arch PC and I started doing

38
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,740
rehearsals in Las Vegas and we're

39
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,520
preparing for our show which was like

40
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:48,899
pretty much like six weeks over MGM Co

41
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:51,299
tie which is in China Macau that's a

42
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,399
part of China isn't it cult I know Macau

43
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,329
yeah well I'm sorry go tie is like

44
00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:00,180
saying like the city Macau is like the

45
00:01:56,329 --> 00:02:01,799
town yeah yeah okay so it's a town in

46
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,630
the city that's where you want yes vote

47
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,159
aye yeah that's what we would say to the

48
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,439
taxi drivers cuz there's two strips

49
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,569
right out there so like Vegas strips

50
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,540
yeah there's like a downtown Las Vegas

51
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:13,300
yeah so when you would tell someone

52
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,250
especially

53
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,200
you didn't speak the same languages and

54
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,580
we would tell him like em gymkata cuz

55
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,350
there was two MGM properties and they

56
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,690
would try to take us to the other one oh

57
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:24,730
he would tell him coat I so you were

58
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,530
living out there for a bottom little

59
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:29,140
over a month right yeah pretty much like

60
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:31,090
six weeks we did the shows we're the

61
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,550
first team to ever have residency out

62
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:36,010
there they've never had like a team or

63
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:38,200
an act that stayed on the show or stayed

64
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,700
on the stage for that amount of time

65
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,920
right everyone's always done like

66
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,510
one-off performances or like you know

67
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,100
quick show here and there and then they

68
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,900
leave but they never had one group just

69
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,550
stay so we were the first and just to

70
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,370
give background for people that might

71
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:54,190
not know Derrick is a before he started

72
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:56,620
working with us editing and stuff he was

73
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:58,090
actually a breakdancer and you were in

74
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,830
the job walking show here yeah I guess

75
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,510
yeah he's also a world-class dance

76
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,550
world-class break dancers loan

77
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:06,250
internationally to perform they laid

78
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:08,200
real competent like hop top-ranked b-boy

79
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,450
yep but he don't talk about it cuz he's

80
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,970
trying to be all modest and stuff but um

81
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,830
yeah and also he's only the quietest

82
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:17,709
people in the group extremely modest but

83
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:19,690
he's actually very physically talented

84
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:23,050
and can pretty much pick up anything

85
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:26,530
physical that he tries yeah you guys are

86
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:29,650
freaking kind very kind shut up honest

87
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,900
dude take a compliment just I mean that

88
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,610
was just people know yeah but it was fun

89
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:37,120
though I mean we're you know we did the

90
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:38,770
show seven shows a week we had double

91
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,070
shows so we did two shows a day

92
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:44,050
sometimes the crowd was like sixteen

93
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,670
hundred people the first show was

94
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:48,100
probably like the most nerve-racking for

95
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:50,950
me right because uh they want to make

96
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,390
sure the show ran smooth and I was the

97
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,090
audience they're like how did it differ

98
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:57,670
from like I'll hear they're so different

99
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:59,980
how so and out here in America like

100
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,750
people will cheer they'll clap they'll

101
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,450
give you a standing ovation to laugh out

102
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,670
there it's like it's just crickets what

103
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:09,450
don't they'll clap and stuff too but you

104
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:11,800
like almost have to tell them down

105
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:13,720
probably a respecting like don't

106
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,810
interrupt the performers you know yeah

107
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,000
you think so even even when I saw like a

108
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,810
movie out there it was so crazy just

109
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,460
because their culture is so different um

110
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,950
so at a movie theater yeah I went to a

111
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:29,350
movie theater and basically i sat

112
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:32,290
dead center of the theater and I had a

113
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:33,840
couple on my right-hand side and they

114
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:36,910
had their cell phones out with their

115
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,030
screen all the way up just like the

116
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:41,980
brightness yeah just their whole movie

117
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,600
during the whole movie then the cup on

118
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,550
my left was just having a normal

119
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,190
conversation I mean about the movie just

120
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,720
talking that's annoying

121
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:51,850
yeah and that was like that's just like

122
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,140
the culture out there and like I end up

123
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,880
eventually getting in on my scene

124
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,350
picking a new one thinking it was gonna

125
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,580
be better but it was like the same thing

126
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,860
happening on it so you think that's just

127
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,450
a cultural thing in China or in Macau

128
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,980
it's just a little different it's just a

129
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,020
little different I mean like even like

130
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,550
personal bubble space was different oh I

131
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,460
know that you know why do they get in

132
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:11,380
your face real close not on purpose

133
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,360
that's just I mean yeah but yeah that's

134
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,250
a culture mm-hmm like if there's room in

135
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,720
an elevator like you can easily go to

136
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,350
the corner but they'll just be like in

137
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,630
your face

138
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:21,520
so the stereotype I mean I don't know if

139
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,500
I should say this or not go for it you

140
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,690
know stereotype when people you see all

141
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,580
all those videos I'm sure not adults I'm

142
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,630
not saying every single person but yeah

143
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,000
the stereotype is there's you know

144
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:33,040
Chinese tourists from China mm-hmm or

145
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,390
tend to be known as like kind of well in

146
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,670
our culture rude but all they're

147
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:38,320
actually it's not even considered rude

148
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,640
it's just part of the culture yeah like

149
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,830
talking during a movie having your

150
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,850
screen brightness like it's like they

151
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,590
give us opposite of what you're saying

152
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,450
it's not like they're trying to be

153
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,860
respectful and not clap for you guys cuz

154
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,210
they don't care about interrupting the

155
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,640
show maybe they're not watching it

156
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,960
completely they had some you know we had

157
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,270
some good nights where like you know

158
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,340
tons of people will clap and laugh but

159
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,840
we also had some bad nights too or it

160
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,980
was just dead quiet and I think

161
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,300
sometimes you got to go

162
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,850
you gotta experience the bad to

163
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,200
appreciate the good right but uh but

164
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:07,270
yeah it's just different like when

165
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,190
people when foreigners come out here and

166
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,540
they do things that are culturally

167
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:12,730
different for us we think that they're

168
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:14,470
rude or yeah you know but they probably

169
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,880
think the same thing about us when we go

170
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:18,700
over there that's true I mean like when

171
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:21,100
we went to Japan I felt like I became a

172
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,290
more polite person but I know for a fact

173
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,060
that I was offending probably a lot of

174
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:26,710
people cuz I don't we don't act the way

175
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,570
they act they're extremely polite

176
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:31,000
everything they do is super polite and

177
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:32,230
like down to like I got Yoda at when I

178
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,570
first went out there for like a business

179
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:37,540
trip because I didn't accept somebody's

180
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:38,770
business card with two hands why if you

181
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,940
if someone hands you a business card

182
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,620
with two hands and

183
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:44,260
don't get used to hands to grab it from

184
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,460
them that's really disrespectful in

185
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:48,460
Japan I don't know if that's like

186
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:50,050
anywhere else but I got yelled at about

187
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,610
you when you receive it well yeah and

188
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:54,670
when you meet them you kind of bow like

189
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:56,560
when you say hello and stuff but yeah

190
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:58,240
like those little things and even like

191
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,670
just like slurping when you're eating

192
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,900
ramen and is considered polite yeah or I

193
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,820
don't know if it's polite but it's like

194
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,370
a compliment to the chef yeah right so

195
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:08,230
like it's not like I can see both sides

196
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,970
yeah like for you know people who

197
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,590
complain about Chinese tourists and you

198
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:14,980
know they do certain things that we can

199
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:17,980
are considered to be rude I guess they

200
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:19,600
probably see Americans go to Japan yeah

201
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,520
you were just there I was just there

202
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:25,930
yeah you're one of the rudest people

203
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:28,060
here but you are out there especially

204
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:31,330
for an American yeah I'm definitely out

205
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:33,520
there but I have a I'm self aware of

206
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,000
myself a lot more now than I have been

207
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,760
before

208
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,190
right well I'm I'm aware like Oh to that

209
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,890
a little bit if I'm being rude yeah like

210
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:52,240
to you guys or whatever it's a joke

211
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:53,470
right it's acceptable do you think is

212
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,570
not acceptable no I think it's fine

213
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:57,550
because we know you exactly but most

214
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:59,110
people I think we see it from a

215
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,280
third-person perspective when you're

216
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,570
like at a restaurant or something and

217
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,600
you do something you think is funny i

218
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:06,430
order for example what i don't know just

219
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,140
like yelling and joking with the waiter

220
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,760
that who might not be having a good day

221
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,770
and you're just assuming that you're

222
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,630
making their day I'm making you could be

223
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:15,669
a waiter that's why and so like you go

224
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,290
through repetition all the time and so

225
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:18,490
to have someone like like cuz usually

226
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:20,410
when I joke with him it's like a

227
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,790
compliment type of thing - uh-huh

228
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,919
let me ask you this right and when you

229
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:27,940
introduce people to Paco do you have

230
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:30,580
like a disclaimer to a certain degree

231
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:32,680
yeah depending what I mean I'm not like

232
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,349
a very like oh he's different

233
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:38,589
mm-hmm um a lot of people say oh I met

234
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:40,089
Paco epic oh and then when they see

235
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:41,950
their reaction to how they felt about

236
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:44,350
you because of everything oh he's funny

237
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:46,300
and it's like okay yeah I'm he's stupid

238
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,980
he does dumb things but if it's like

239
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:52,900
yeah I met Paco and they don't and they

240
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:54,070
stop there it's like yeah I'm sorry it's

241
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,600
like the three dots

242
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,950
we don't know lady did he get naked in

243
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,590
front of you we don't know like who

244
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:02,470
knows what he's doing I'm predictable

245
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:06,040
yeah I do a lot of dumb things but

246
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:07,720
usually it the situation is right I'd

247
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,460
say within was it within the past year

248
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,290
I'm a lot better but in the past you

249
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:14,020
have a lot better better when we first

250
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:16,780
met you you were very wild no I was I

251
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,460
was I was actually very conservative in

252
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,810
the very beginning he was it was like

253
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:23,230
that brief like when you're shy

254
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:24,910
yeah with entering the group funniest

255
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,880
funny story about entering that when you

256
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:29,530
were and entered the group

257
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,370
Derek we found out like only this past

258
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:35,470
year when Paco first came here three

259
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:37,480
years ago we didn't know this but Derek

260
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,730
didn't like him for a year I didn't know

261
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,140
that it was like two years yeah Derek so

262
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,450
quiet and polite he won't say anything

263
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,800
no the thing was Derek was like even

264
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,180
when he didn't like me he came up he's

265
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,950
like hey you want to do the show with me

266
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,780
it's called wild card and I was like oh

267
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:50,950
cool so I was like yeah Derek likes me

268
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,320
he wants to do it show it me he must

269
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:56,440
have liked him by then what to do wild

270
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:58,000
card yeah I mean I guess what didn't you

271
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,030
like what didn't you like about him

272
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,190
mm-hmm it's not so much that I I don't

273
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:04,600
know man it's just hard question yeah it

274
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:07,480
is kind of a difficult question because

275
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,890
I'm awesome you think to me more you

276
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,810
just think you hate me but I'm just all

277
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:12,970
he said we nobody said they hated you

278
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:15,310
Derek I just didn't know who you were

279
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:17,470
I didn't know like what your intentions

280
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:19,720
were with the group I guess I was kind

281
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:21,700
of being like the protective guy of the

282
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,670
of the group you know like kinda like

283
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:26,050
the guard dog you know I mean we've seen

284
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:27,370
tons of people come in the group and

285
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:30,100
leave the group for different reasons

286
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:32,080
maybe they've asked for stuff and maybe

287
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,450
they wanted something like personally

288
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,760
but with Paco I just I had no idea with

289
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:39,460
him no idea what his intentions were

290
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:42,610
mm-hmm but I mean like over time he

291
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:45,750
became a cool guy but you know I did I

292
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:50,950
did have to make a disclaimer for him -

293
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:53,590
who did you talk to everyone so you're

294
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:56,710
about to be my friend but just just he's

295
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:59,920
different like your disclosure mine's

296
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:01,930
more like mine's more like crazy

297
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:06,580
Paco he's a cool guy but he does some

298
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:07,780
shocking stuff so the thing is if people

299
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,370
know you it's not a big deal

300
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:12,040
because they know like most of time

301
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:14,560
you're doing it as a joke yeah

302
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,660
for whatever reason even if it's not

303
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,900
necessarily you know their style of

304
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:21,760
comedy you'll still do it yeah but but

305
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:24,820
also I'll do it you do things in front

306
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,250
of people sometimes that you might make

307
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,510
us laugh but they might be like well

308
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,340
that's rude yeah

309
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:32,620
they don't know you're joking yeah yeah

310
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,720
but that's fine but I say my I say my

311
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,280
disclaimer not not to hate on you or

312
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,110
anything like I say it's for your sake

313
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,970
yeah yeah I know you guys looking out

314
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:41,590
for me he's like oh he's just joking I

315
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,270
want them to experience like the good

316
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:45,220
side of you too you know I think I think

317
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:48,400
okay I'm the one that does like all this

318
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:51,640
crazy stuff maybe in public where it

319
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,920
could be a little bit more dangerous but

320
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,600
all of us do something crazy to an

321
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,340
extent I mean within our group within

322
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,720
our most viewed groups do that though

323
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,550
yeah a lot of friend groups say things

324
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,440
and do things in front of each other

325
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,910
that they would never do with you know

326
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,710
out in public I'm not the only one who

327
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:08,110
gets naked in the group yeah well you're

328
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:10,510
not yeah say who it is but you

329
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:14,320
definitely get naked for no reason the

330
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:17,520
most for sure I would say and we don't

331
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,080
ask you to but it makes you guys laugh

332
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,030
it's more like a shocking kind of thing

333
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,500
yeah yeah but it's like if like during

334
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,910
set you know and it's like oh man

335
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,710
everyone's like a little bit down I

336
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,390
noticed we'll make people laugh you know

337
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:31,120
give them a little bit that's not what I

338
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:33,070
am a little bit of energy I mean maybe

339
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,730
it helps some of the guys hey you laugh

340
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:38,040
do though sometimes brightens your day

341
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:41,589
most the time I see him do this laugh

342
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:45,550
you know no but he laughs after his

343
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:46,810
forehead a little bit rub his eyes kind

344
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,640
of like looks around in the corner I'm

345
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:53,020
like is this really happening yeah this

346
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:55,240
is gonna be over Derek no see so bad

347
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:57,730
it's not that bad I mean yes we want to

348
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,560
be unlike Derek was literally almost I

349
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:02,410
think your opposite I think so dude

350
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:04,060
quiet guy who's like always like not

351
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:10,450
gonna say what he's thinking necessarily

352
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:12,400
gonna be polite and respectful yeah I

353
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,839
think it's an interesting dynamic that

354
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,610
kind of really relationship usually

355
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,500
works if you have two of you in a group

356
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,850
oh you know end up fighting yeah that's

357
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,970
annoying and they end up trying to top

358
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,750
each other and it becomes competitive

359
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,129
yeah I don't know if there's other

360
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:25,230
friend groups out there that have that

361
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:27,930
usually friend groups have like one guy

362
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:29,459
like that mmm but also my experience is

363
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,980
idea of two people who are like that

364
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:33,060
they have to have like a good

365
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:36,269
understanding of each other in a

366
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:37,829
relationship where that it isn't too

367
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:39,930
much of a competition you know when to

368
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:42,420
stop cuz there are there are very few

369
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:44,129
people who can do that that is true yeah

370
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,720
you know what though on based on

371
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:47,279
entertainment you're the character

372
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,930
people like though cuz you're like the

373
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,819
not at first

374
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:53,490
well you're like the Naruto basically

375
00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:55,560

377
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,579
like the crazy guy who's like that does

378
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:01,680
things that people might shake their

379
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:03,600
head at mmm but that's like funny to

380
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,730
people you're like the Ralph from

381
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,740
Simpsons there you go yeah I don't know

382
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:13,290
who that is but it's a guy that picks

383
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:16,310
his nose okay all right you also should

384
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:19,259
give disclaimer for Derek Derek is a

385
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:21,569

00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:23,490
yeah let's miss Derek now no he's not

387
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:27,300
it's not really a dislike Derek time

388
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:29,610
he'll pretend to be more confused and

389
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:32,819
confusing than he really is mm-hmm I

390
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:35,370
think and it's not for see I do things

391
00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:38,670
usually to make you guys laugh Derek

00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,899
your own entertainment sometimes and

out of that house that's amazing so

425
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:59,410
that's that's shit-talking that's I'm

426
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:00,760
doing my disclaim we're doing our

427
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:03,430
disclaimer to help so that when they

428
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:06,580
meet you they're not like oh I should be

429
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:08,950
offended yeah for saying this guy does

430
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,390
not like people he stays home and he

431
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:12,240
does not want to meet you oh you want to

432
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:14,380
take it in that they're saying no

433
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,050
there's been a lot of times where we've

434
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:18,910
had Paco say like something crazy

435
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:21,839
outlandish about Ryan that Ryan's never

436
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:24,910
said before to other people like what

437
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,800
there's a lot of times hmm where I I

438
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:28,990
mean it's it's just happened so often

439
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,830
I'm just like what did I say that or

440
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:32,620
what did I do that

441
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:34,089
and I'm just like and then you wouldn't

442
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:37,839
go would you okay yeah but I wouldn't

443
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:39,520
tell it to them I'm being honest man

444
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:43,630
that's not necessarily being honest

445
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:45,250
sometimes shooting yourself down this

446
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:47,320
became a therapy session hey you know

447
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:51,100
what every episode I mean is a therapy

448
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:52,390
session I know but it's fun they're a

449
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:56,200
piece of Gator we could all have therapy

450
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:58,420
I mean there's there's no um you should

451
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:03,130
be a stigma on that Oh is there a flare

452
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:05,800
up piece eNOS of the week not bad come

453
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:08,650
on don't owe me thinking it was a penis

454
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,839
thing actually like therapy's actually I

455
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:12,040
think is really helpful because I I had

456
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,990
a heart-to-heart talk with you yesterday

457
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:16,870
and it's actually like really good to

458
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:19,120
just air out everything rather than like

459
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:21,699
we did that in private yeah but now you

460
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,079
can tell the podcast in the world like

461
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:25,720
why you bring that up are you gonna tell

462
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:27,280
us I mean we you know like I've just

463
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,340
been going through some rough times and

464
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,230
off-camera like I may I may look like

465
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,210
pretty sad and stuff on camera but off

466
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:35,470
camera I really got to talk to Ryan

467
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,990
about some personal stuff that's

468
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:40,120
happening in my life and yeah it was it

469
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,410
was really good to air it out and you

470
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,770
gave me some like helpful information

471
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:45,750
and direction and just advice that I

472
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:48,539
feel as I

473
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:50,850
I need to hear so and that's good I

474
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:53,940
don't want to pry if it's too private

475
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:55,380
you know but I guess for viewers that it

476
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,450
could be going through something similar

477
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,799
you you know maybe you can give them

478
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,750
like some general advice that would you

479
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,429
guys spoke about you know if you don't

480
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,809
feel comfortable talking just bring up

481
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:06,179
to the point that you want to talk about

482
00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:08,789
it I mean to summon up I'm basically

483
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:11,010
going through a breakup and you know

484
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:15,059
it's real tough you know coming out from

485
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:17,850
a long relationship and I just you know

486
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:20,280
I felt lost I felt confused felt like

487
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:22,830
inadequate and this guy over here just

488
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:25,679
like really like instilled some some

489
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:27,929
good words back into me and I think if

490
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,370
anyone is having like some similar

491
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:31,289
trouble like that it's probably best

492
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:33,090
that's turned your friends and talked to

493
00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:34,679
each other rather than just holding it

494
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,750
in because those thoughts can go deeper

495
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:38,220
and deeper and deeper and that stuff can

496
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,470
manifest into something like real

497
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,900
negative well I think the reason why I

498
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:44,730
even said anything is because I mean we

499
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,230
could I mean I could see it that there

500
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:48,929
was like something bothering you and

501
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:50,850
then I'm like you and that I like to

502
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:52,470
hold in my own feeling like I'm like I'm

503
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:54,000
not gonna bother someone else yes and

504
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,039
like it's not gonna help me you know

505
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,690
even though it does it does help even if

506
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:59,070
you're like me or Derek where you just

507
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,110
don't like to talk about your feelings

508
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:03,120
and I don't know that's a bringing thing

509
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:04,440
or just personality thing but it's

510
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,480
literally the opposite of some like Paco

511
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,370
it when you have issues you literally

512
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,140
hey can we talk yeah like I would never

513
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:12,210
say that Derek would never say that you

514
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:14,669
know but unless I unless I go to him or

515
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:16,919
you know vice versa and I feel that I

516
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:19,350
feel that like like of course I'm going

517
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:20,909
through some stuff and like in my head

518
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:23,100
what's the point in calling someone else

519
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:24,570
too everyone's got their own problems

520
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,580
you know like why would I want to bring

521
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:28,440
my problems on to someone else or yeah

522
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,419
but it was actually really helpful to

523
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,039
just kind of like talk it through right

524
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:36,210
so I would recommend that yeah yeah and

525
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:37,890
I think from my perspective because

526
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:40,770
we're very different like you guys said

527
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:43,200
the reason why I bring up my problems

528
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:45,539
because I know other people have

529
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,429
different perspectives and that they

530
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:50,309
have a view that you know maybe could

531
00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:52,860
show me oh I didn't consider this you

532
00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:54,450
know maybe you know and sometimes we get

533
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:58,770
too caught up in our own thoughts and we

534
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:59,690
overthink situations and we start going

535
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:02,000
down a 10

536
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:03,710
that's like not even logical or possible

537
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,580
but it's because we're so consumed in

538
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:09,350
this that having someone else from an

539
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,759
outside view speaking to our lives

540
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,200
especially someone who cares about us

541
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:14,149
and will be real with us and not

542
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,289
sugarcoat it like that that's always

543
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:16,519
helpful and that's what I think and

544
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:19,039
that's why I like I appreciate you guys

545
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:22,879
well I think the number one thing that

546
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:26,120
we came to as a conclusion yesterday and

547
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:27,769
I don't I don't mean without having to

548
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,149
say too much you can talk about it if

549
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:32,090
you want but I think the number one

550
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:34,639
thing that I think I learned not

551
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:36,350
yesterday would I was telling you and I

552
00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:40,519
think I told you too in the in the past

553
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:42,799
but it was that it's okay to feel shitty

554
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:44,090
like you should feel shitty because we

555
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,039
were I mean we were talking over like a

556
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,659
couple of drinks and I was just worried

557
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:49,909
like I've seen people when they go

558
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:52,039
through that kind of stuff they you know

559
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:53,899
whether they smoke or they drink or they

560
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:55,789
do whatever they can to kind of escape

561
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:57,440
it but it's not you're not really

562
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:58,970
escaping anything like you're just

563
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,470
putting it off and it's gonna let it

564
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,419
build yeah like it's just gonna get

565
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:03,919
worse and worse and worse and the worse

566
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:05,539
it gets the more you drink your smoke to

567
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,620
cover it up and it just keeps building

568
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:07,909
it's not going anywhere

569
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:10,340
you might feel fine because you're high

570
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:12,289
or you're drunk but it's it's just

571
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,789
building so at some point you got to

572
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:15,350
face it and you're if you let it build

573
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:17,059
more it's just gonna be worse later down

574
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,590
the road yeah that's the way I see it at

575
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:20,149
least and I think it's okay to just like

576
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:21,740
like you should be feeling like [ __ ]

577
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:23,389
like don't try and like avoid it because

578
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,279
you got a face at some point yeah yeah

579
00:21:23,389 --> 00:21:28,370
one thing I learned over in China was

580
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:30,440
actually like something that I the whole

581
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:32,000
China trip felt like fate to me with the

582
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,320
conversations I had with people and the

583
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,580
things that I learned and one of the

584
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:38,480
things I learned over there was that

585
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:40,940
like you know I was taught like a 10 a

586
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,370
10 rule 10 rule a week kind of thing

587
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,600
which is uh if you have like a lot of

588
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:46,190
stresses in your life you have like a

589
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,139
lot of depression or issues that you're

590
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:50,029
going through like you know try to

591
00:21:48,139 --> 00:21:52,100
maximize that to ten and what do you

592
00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:54,440
think is really worth that effort to

593
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:56,299
stress over so for example if you're

594
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,820
stress about money you're stressed about

595
00:21:56,299 --> 00:22:00,470
like you know your situation your living

596
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,360
situation that's already two things you

597
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:04,309
know and you only have eight left and if

598
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,169
you give that a week you know you could

599
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:08,360
pile on a lot of things in in a list of

600
00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:09,049
ten you know so what really deserves

601
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,350
your time

602
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:13,520
what really deserves like your energy to

603
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:16,520
really feel negative about something

604
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,740
so you're saying like the you only have

605
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,970
the capacity to care about ten things is

606
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:22,190
that what you're saying yeah and those

607
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:23,960
10 things should be very valuable like

608
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,490
it should really be something that makes

609
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,110
that list rather than like you know

610
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:28,550
there's tons of little things that

611
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,900
people are always stressed about you

612
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:33,020
know yeah finance

613
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:34,280
I don't know social media the right

614
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,900
shoes I don't know you know like

615
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,490
everyone's got their own problems but is

616
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,350
it really worth like to make artists

617
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:42,140
smart where did you hear that from like

618
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:43,460
it sounds like a therapist John it was

619
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,110
actually from a girl that I met out

620
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,880
there and she told me like you know

621
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:49,370
that's how she copes with stuff she also

622
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,690
told me like you know she has like this

623
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:53,990
five year rule or something like that

624
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:56,390
where if something is not gonna affect

625
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:58,610
you in five years and you shouldn't put

626
00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:00,020
that much effort into it I was like

627
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:02,510
that's pretty interesting either

628
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:04,460
something's not gonna I've never really

629
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:06,200
thought of it like that so it was it was

630
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,400
kind of cool to hear your different

631
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:11,059
perspectives kind of like how you said

632
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:12,590
you know yeah yeah and I I think just

633
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:14,570
where the sake of it that for the

634
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:15,320
disclaimer and everything like just

635
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,400
because you're going through a breakup

636
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,610
and everything doesn't mean you have any

637
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,230
ill-will towards Eric alright like oh no

638
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:23,240
yeah I think that's something we should

639
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:25,490
bring up yeah I would never like wish

640
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,929
anything bad upon her we've had you know

641
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:28,880
we've had a good relationship and I

642
00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:31,160
don't want nobody to tweet negative

643
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,570
things to her right bad comments we you

644
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,540
know we had a clean break up is just

645
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:36,110
tough yeah yeah yeah such a long time

646
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,390
too

647
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:40,340
yeah and if you like respect like Derek

648
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:41,750
and and Erica or even just Derek or

649
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:44,179
whatever or Ryan guys like you would not

650
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:45,710
go after you know someone like that

651
00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:47,660
especially if you still like care about

652
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:49,309
them she's a friendship yeah for sure

653
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,260
we're definitely friends I mean we still

654
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:53,210
talk sometimes we have lunch you know

655
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:58,640
it's just it's just a different page now

656
00:23:53,210 --> 00:24:00,740
which is okay yeah yeah yeah I went we

657
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,330
went deep therapy session we did I mean

658
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,950
early into the podcast how was it for

659
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:05,929
you when you made that video you know

660
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:08,120
you made a video on your YouTube channel

661
00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:12,110
about a breakup did that help

662
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:14,390
it uh it helped me a lot and I'm very

663
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:16,520
lucky that you know I didn't come out

664
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:21,050
with my relationship and see like who it

665
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:23,270
was and stuff and show but it was very

666
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:25,370
therapeutic to me because like you guys

667
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:27,020
said I'm somebody who like really I'm

668
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,500
very I wear my heart on my sleeve I'm

669
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:31,039
very

670
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:33,080
you know I'm not soft though but uh like

671
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,510
you're pretty soft I mean you're like a

672
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,950
definitely more emotional than both of

673
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:39,140
us I think you're like the most common

674
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,980
toilet paper yeah the most emotional

675
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,960
person in the group

676
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:43,549
sure one person who's spoken to my life

677
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,940
a lot every Instagram picture I post

678
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:51,320
since that podcast he puts toilet paper

679
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:54,260
emojis soft who this guy collide that's

680
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:56,740
funny yeah that's um but it helped me a

681
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:59,240
lot because it got me to I guess be

682
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:02,240
transparent with who I am and say like

683
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:05,840
this is the mistakes I made this is how

684
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:08,000
I was viewing a life and her and clearly

685
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:11,600
I was I had a lot of clouded judgment I

686
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,590
was infatuated and it was kind of just

687
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,940
like because it's something that

688
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,960
everybody goes through everybody goes

689
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,700
through that like that first

690
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,679
relationship or you know one of the

691
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:21,950
first ones and it just does not go well

692
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:23,570
and everyone has to go through that but

693
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:24,710
a lot of times people will be like all

694
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:26,330
this first relationship was suppose to

695
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:29,720
be everything they over romanticize it

696
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:32,240
is all my fault and for me I felt that

697
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,850
way too but I also learned things from

698
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,679
it and I was like this is like not just

699
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:38,419
the advice that I have to give but it's

700
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:40,640
kind of advice that you all like pour it

701
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:41,919
into me and like spoken to me you know

702
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,789
so in a way I was just like

703
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,940
regurgitating a lot of things that you

704
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:49,640
guys have told me she basically stole my

705
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:52,340
video then and like our videos and yeah

706
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:55,700
oh okay good and I made money off of it

707
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:57,799
so that's nice nice student someone is

708
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:04,970
almost at a million so thanks man no I

709
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:07,700
did well yeah it's a good script it's

710
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:09,470
not scripted all right what is it is

711
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,880
that video it has no cuts no edits

712
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:12,590
because I wanted to be very like

713
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,070
transparent and show like I didn't write

714
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:18,260
down any of this mm-hmm you know right

715
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:19,880
well moving on to a non a less serious

716
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:22,520
topic and something since Derek's here

717
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,470

719
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:28,610
Derek is one of those hardcore Marvel

720
00:26:26,809 --> 00:26:28,909

of someone dead or you know yeah

772
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:14,600
something something like that yeah

773
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:16,159
people really eight spoilers I mean I

774
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:20,450
can relate to it there's a reason why I

775
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:23,090
didn't watch the what was it there's a

776
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:25,220
big thing oh oh the UM the firt the

777
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:27,799
Avengers that uh the most recent one

778
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:29,330
that came up oh yeah with Thanos so I

779
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:31,429
saw that only when it came on Netflix so

780
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:32,870
we're gonna watch it in in theaters but

781
00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:34,490
I knew the ending I was like okay well

782
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:36,230
something happens and there's a meme and

783
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:38,899
people disintegrate or something like

784
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:41,090
that's no boilers dude I don't get to

785
00:28:38,899 --> 00:28:42,799
see it if okay here's my thing if you

786
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:45,409
haven't seen it by the time it's out of

787
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:47,480
theaters that is your problem like for

788
00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:49,039
real like if people do that about Naruto

789
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,019
and when that was like coming out live

790
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,279
and like people would get mad because I

791
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:53,870
would talk about stuff they came out

792
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:56,120
like maybe about like a month or two

793
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:57,919
I'm like well if you're not gonna like

794
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,960
if you're not gonna keep up then you

795
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,549
don't really care that much and that's

796
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,350
how I felt - I didn't care that I knew

797
00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:05,929
the ending but I didn't go watch it no

798
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:07,640
it was on Netflix yeah manatee war was

799
00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:09,770
dope they packed like tons of different

800
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,750
storylines and characters into one movie

801
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:13,419
that was just like just blew your mind

802
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:16,340
you know like they've been doing this

803
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:18,740
what for a long time like over a decade

804
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:20,840
you know just planting seeds and letting

805
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:22,940
it letting it grow watering in and

806
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,580
getting everyone together it's just it's

807
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:28,789
a dope movie Marvel knows what's up see

808
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:30,320
so I have always been like excited that

809
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:31,610
it I was excited because I thought I was

810
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,350
coming to an end not because I don't

811
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:36,020
like those movies but because it's like

812
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:37,549
oh all these talented actors and

813
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,779
talented like screenwriters and all

814
00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:40,490
these people putting all this I feel

815
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:43,700
like every movie that comes out these

816
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:45,500
days are like a recreation of something

817
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:47,750
there's nothing really original anymore

818
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,100
that does box office like records other

819
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:51,169
than stuff that like Jordan Peele is

820
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:53,600
doing with Gale you know yeah what does

821
00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:55,010
the recent one us yes yeah he's only

822
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,720
part like I mean there's there's some

823
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:58,279
others too that are doing original stuff

824
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,500
but everything else like oh they're

825
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:01,850
making a live-action Disney movie yeah

826
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,340
they're doing Omar because they know it

827
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:06,049
makes money yeah but like I just miss

828
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,460
the days when like you miss them every

829
00:30:06,049 --> 00:30:09,409
yeah there was like something original

830
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:10,580
oh that's a unique idea or it's like

831
00:30:09,409 --> 00:30:12,909
kind of like this but it's kind of

832
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:15,200
unique it's not just a recreation of

833
00:30:12,909 --> 00:30:16,549
something that's already been told so

834
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,020
who do you blame you blame the studio's

835
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:20,840
you blame like audience retention it's

836
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:23,390
both pretend it's it's the audience it's

837
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,070
our fault for buying into it like it of

838
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:27,320
course the studio's gonna make what they

839
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:29,059
want to make right yeah but it is also I

840
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:30,820
think the studios because they decide

841
00:30:29,059 --> 00:30:33,740
who they're gonna fund there's tons of

842
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:35,720
talented writers and scripts constantly

843
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:37,370
being you know I'm sure pitch to these

844
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,559
studios but why would they make those

845
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:40,880
movies and take the risk of putting in

846
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:42,950
all this money for something that they

847
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,270
don't know how it's gonna do verse make

848
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:47,690
something that's already has a proven

849
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:50,090
fan base and for sure milk the benefits

850
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:51,919
you know it's have to say it's a studio

851
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:53,390
it's just money billions yeah but it's

852
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:55,730
like money kills creation like

853
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:57,020
creativity for sure I think for the most

854
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:58,039
part it's anything for it with YouTube

855
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,200
like that's what happened to you too

856
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:02,360
because people like a formula like they

857
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:06,320
like knowing what's gonna happen when

858
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:07,280
money gets involved yes yeah I mean

859
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:11,000
that's

860
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:12,590
yeah you know yeah so yeah I was excited

861
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,960
that it was coming to me for that reason

862
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:16,940
but I guess it's not I mean I'm excited

863
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,740
yeah I want to know what happens yeah -

00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:06,020
that it's so similar to like a lot of

900
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:07,700
the villains in Naruto Naruto just for

901
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:09,440
the people who get mad at me for seeing

902
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:13,370
it wrong right I'll fight you I'm from

903
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:15,410
America okay that's how I speak actually

904
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:18,560
you're from now retail I'm from Hawaii

905
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:20,840
gets America yeah a lot of people don't

906
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,700
think so but the thing I like about that

907
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:26,419
thanos and the villains that they have

908
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:27,679
um you know in like art or other a lot

909
00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:30,470
of enemies actually they actually

910
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,830
believe that they're doing good for the

911
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,480
world

912
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:34,370
mm-hmm like it's actually like thallus

913
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,929
is like as much as he did like horrible

914
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:38,299
things like he destroyed half the world

915
00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:41,960
right population wise it was out of in

916
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:45,500
his mind mercy right and he actually I

917
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:47,210
mean it's kind of like a not an analogy

918
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,010
but it's kind of like the whole it's

919
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:50,990
very much so related to the thought

920
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:52,760
behind like the conspiracy theory or on

921
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:54,710
the Illuminati in the New World Order

922
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:56,809
but like this world is being too

923
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:57,860
overpopulated we're all gonna suffer at

924
00:33:56,809 --> 00:33:59,929
some point because you're gonna run out

925
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:02,029
of resources so if you were to reduce

926
00:33:59,929 --> 00:34:03,679
the population right scientific I mean

927
00:34:02,029 --> 00:34:06,799
this is not saying that I agree with

928
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,850
this or that we should do this but what

929
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,490
they're saying is if you reduce a

930
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:12,139
population it's actually mercy on the

931
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:13,429
people like the human race will still

932
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:16,460
survive cuz at the rate that we're

933
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:18,500
growing everyone's gonna die mm-hmm huh

934
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:20,540
what are your thoughts on that I think I

935
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,919
think you should happen you think half

936
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:23,450
the world should be but no not

937
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:25,609
necessarily half the world but I don't

938
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:27,440
think start to be we should die I think

939
00:34:25,609 --> 00:34:28,940
people who type that's a hot take I

940
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,429
think people type first on YouTube

941
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:33,310
videos and dislike videos even before

942
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:36,230
they watch the whole thing should die um

943
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:37,520
I think so we were trying to make a

944
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:39,080
serious conversation when you're just

945
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,389
naming people that annoy you

946
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:44,750
I think people annoying me should die I

947
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:47,210
think people who I don't know I'm not

948
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:49,129
someone to be like you know oh these

949
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:51,830
people should die just think like there

950
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:53,240
are ways that we can go about making

951
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:55,760
sure everybody's okay cuz you guys heard

952
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:59,359
about the whole like uh no no turd on

953
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:02,210
the yeah the fire yeah right and it did

954
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:04,670
like I think couple millions it's not

955
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:07,520
billion dollars of damage to it and

956
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:11,300
people are donating money to get it

957
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,740
fixed already but a lot of a lot of

958
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,560
Catholic people feel like why are we

959
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:17,750
donating money to a building when we all

960
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,940
that money that we're spending could be

961
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:20,869
used like feeding homeless people or

962
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,450
helping people who have been through

963
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:26,119
naturally so I mean like that yeah and

964
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:27,530
how rich the church actually is ready

965
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:30,440
like they could easily afford to build

966
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:31,910
it back but if you think about it it's

967
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,020
it's cuz it was covered in the news

968
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:34,190
right uh-huh

969
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,990
like

970
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:38,420
and so people feel so distraught by it

971
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:40,970
because it's like a monument is a symbol

972
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:42,619
yeah it's a symbol but so it's like if

973
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:44,809
they were covering like this huge event

974
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:46,549
that happened to kids you know starving

975
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,660
recently if it was just a news thing

976
00:35:46,549 --> 00:35:50,180
like something that was just on the news

977
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:51,470
mainstream media everywhere like in the

978
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:53,750
same way that that fire was covered

979
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:55,280
something kids are always starving but

980
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:57,589
if there was some big event where all of

981
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,630
a sudden tons of kids were being covered

982
00:35:57,589 --> 00:36:01,369
on the news for starving I guarantee you

983
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:04,130
that same thing would happen yeah it's

984
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:06,319
just a matter of people get take action

985
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:07,700
when they're emotional ah majora not

986
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:09,289
everyone some people actually help

987
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,539
because of you know they they really

988
00:36:09,289 --> 00:36:12,619
care about what's happening yeah but

989
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:13,970
some people are just going based off

990
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:15,200
emotion like oh my god this is awful I

991
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:16,520
need to do something which is a good

992
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,559
thing like it's a good thing to feel

993
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:21,349
that way but that brings me to my point

994
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:23,630
like they're only caring about that

995
00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:27,710
cause because it's covered in the news

996
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:30,079
so much I mean that's why I think but I

997
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:32,480
mean you're I was just talking about the

998
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,160
aspect they're like we could not have to

999
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,260
kill and necessarily a bunch of people

1000
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,510
we could just figure out how to solve

1001
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:40,279
that issue in a different way because we

1002
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:41,990
do have like a lot of resources that

1003
00:36:40,279 --> 00:36:44,329
could help that out well tell that to

1004
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:46,579
Thanos maybe maybe people can like stop

1005
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:48,260
eating meat like they could stop eating

1006
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:52,430
me and like start eating like more

1007
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:54,380
greens I mean that is that that I know

1008
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:56,240
what you're talking about yeah but it's

1009
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:58,220
not are you are you gonna actually stop

1010
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,380
eating meat Derek they should call

1011
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:02,150
themselves vegans

1012
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:03,349
there's vegetarians yeah I mean well I

1013
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:07,099
mean what he's talking about

1014
00:37:03,349 --> 00:37:10,400
I think is another solution but what

1015
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:11,900
we're talking about is an alternative

1016
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,240
like for coming from what you're saying

1017
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:17,119
from the Thanos perspective right I'm

1018
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:18,109
giving an analogy why did he if he would

1019
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,309
that gauntlet thing I don't know what

1020
00:37:18,109 --> 00:37:21,619
does it have you can do anything with it

1021
00:37:19,309 --> 00:37:23,630
right pretty much she's got some stones

1022
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:25,460
so instead of killing half the world why

1023
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:27,859
didn't he just create a second world or

1024
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:30,470
the population yeah or if here you live

1025
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:32,869
here everyone lives or he snaps and just

1026
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:35,150
doubles the food he doesn't what end the

1027
00:37:32,869 --> 00:37:37,039
land yeah we need right why could I do

1028
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:39,020
that he doesn't work like that man why

1029
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:41,390
why it so he is evil the net that

1030
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:43,609
defeats my first point like he's not

1031
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:45,820
doing it for PR see ant-man should go in

1032
00:37:43,609 --> 00:37:48,760
his butthole and explode him Nina

1033
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:50,770
mmm Danish theory yeah I mean in his

1034
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:53,130
storyline like he's doing that for years

1035
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:55,930
like going to galaxies and just like

1036
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:58,690
wiping out half of it already to help

1037
00:37:55,930 --> 00:38:00,130
him it's C but it's not really he'll

1038
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:02,020
like if you have that kind of power you

1039
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:04,300
don't need to kill half the world right

1040
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:06,010
you could just if you can have if you're

1041
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,390
like a guy why not just create like you

1042
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:09,780
said more resource or maybe when he

1043
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:12,370
snaps he's sending them to another world

1044
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:13,030
and that world has enough resources for

1045
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:18,820
everybody

1046
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:20,740
man maybe we misjudge stano's I mean

1047
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:23,560
yeah I would see it actually that one if

1048
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:25,990
it's the last one I'll see it yeah but

1049
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,090
it's three hours long holy

1050
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:29,680
I know it's types like Titanic though I

1051
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:31,810
know I don't think I could sit through

1052
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,580
that now but Titanic had some nipples

1053
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:35,730
and that was I remember that I was a

1054
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:38,080
little kid my nipples in Avengers

1055
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:41,050
there's tons of nipples and Avengers

1056
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:43,750
girl nipples though mmm yeah now you're

1057
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:46,450
talking Game of Thrones you don't watch

1058
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:47,620
that I have seen I watched a little bit

1059
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:49,060
of Game of Thrones acts pretty much

1060
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:50,290
anything that's mainstream and people

1061
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:53,440
like you don't really know not

1062
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:55,540
necessarily is I I just like video games

1063
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,150
a lot I know but enough time for that

1064
00:38:55,540 --> 00:39:03,160
stuff I watch James I watched Game of

1065
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:04,840
Thrones man it's not so bad but I watch

1066
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,910
Game of Thrones with his girl who I

1067
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:09,490
liked I know you're already laughing

1068
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:11,080
look at that what but and then when we

1069
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:12,490
kind of like stop talking I'm somebody

1070
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:15,070
who associate stuff that I do with

1071
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:16,420
people with them you know so I can't

1072
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:17,800
watch Game of Thrones without thinking

1073
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,970
about her I mean we're cool now and

1074
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,230
everything but back then I was like well

1075
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:22,780
I can't watch this anymore because then

1076
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:26,470
I just feel sad it's so emotional yeah

1077
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:28,060
poor guy hmm you what you want to watch

1112
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,770
say

1113
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:50,460
I didn't hear which is yep insist oh

1114
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:53,010
yeah you know what that was about no I

1115
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:54,840
mean the thing about Game of Thrones and

1116
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:57,090
always made me wonder too cuz you know

1117
00:40:54,840 --> 00:41:00,270
back in the day wasn't the whole idea of

1118
00:40:57,090 --> 00:41:01,500
like being royal and you know keeping it

1119
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:03,570
within the bloodline yeah aren't they

1120
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,530
all product of incest yeah technically

1121
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:07,920
aren't we all

1122
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:10,920
it's in some way I guess it depends on

1123
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,720
your religion yeah but but yeah I mean

1124
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,550
it's like in the whole like the

1125
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,590
Christian thing or whatever right cuz

1126
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:17,940
then it's like it starts up at the top

1127
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:19,500
of the tree there's Adam and Eve and

1128
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:21,360
they are they related then no they're

1129
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:23,850
not related but still like you know

1130
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,740
where do they make how do they make how

1131
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:29,400
do their babies make babies yeah there's

1132
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:33,870
no there cuz no they're siblings right

1133
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:34,950
yeah yeah well now we know let's talk

1134
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:37,620
about the season the hell up bad about

1135
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:41,000
Christianity okay I should not even as a

1136
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:44,070
joke sorry to my Christians out there

1137
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:47,760
that's we we're digging ourselves a hole

1138
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:49,620
right now and man's gonna jump in and

1139
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,660
explode us there you go

1140
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:54,120
and that's kind of funny though that we

1141
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:55,500
can even like not that I said the joke

1142
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,770
but we can even like talk about it

1143
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:59,670
because if this was another religion

1144
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:01,110
specifically like something in the news

1145
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:03,420
yeah I was talking about like Muslims

1146
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:04,770
uh-huh we were seeing someone about that

1147
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,600
we'd be in way more hot water

1148
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:07,440
oh yeah Christianity is like so popular

1149
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,119
here that we can make fun of because

1150
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,490
it's always like punching up as

1151
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:13,950
you're bunching up it's okay sure that's

1152
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:15,240
why like you know black people like when

1153
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:17,249
they do comedies that they can make fun

1154
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:19,319
of white people true sure what a white

1155
00:42:17,249 --> 00:42:21,660
person can't make fun of of Yashin or

1156
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:25,319
even an Asian really yeah yeah yeah that

1157
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:28,400
makes me think where do we fall on the

1158
00:42:25,319 --> 00:42:32,099
chart we're kind of like below white

1159
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,849
above or below black do you think so

1160
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:34,440
yeah I think so

1161
00:42:32,849 --> 00:42:35,549
because I feel like a Asian couldn't

1162
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,170
make fun of a black person for being

1163
00:42:35,549 --> 00:42:39,390
black no we can that person could make

1164
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:40,799
fun of an Asian for being I think I

1165
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,970
think it's kind of like similar levels

1166
00:42:40,799 --> 00:42:44,819
yeah it's pretty close I think it's

1167
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:46,650
close yeah no I was just thinking about

1168
00:42:44,819 --> 00:42:48,029
that sorry random tangent it's tough to

1169
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:49,680
say you look like you were trying gonna

1170
00:42:48,029 --> 00:42:50,430
say something Derrick I mean it's just

1171
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,049
my opinion

1172
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:54,240
Asians don't really get casted that much

1173
00:42:52,049 --> 00:42:55,920
to be lead role son true though true I

1174
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,589
don't know where they stand on the on

1175
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,970
the food chart but the food is

1176
00:42:58,589 --> 00:43:02,099
definitely on the lower and I would

1177
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:04,319
think yeah yeah that's true but I mean

1178
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:06,299
like like I said in a previous video

1179
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,640
like Steve Harvey making fun of Asians

1180
00:43:06,299 --> 00:43:10,499
and it cost him his career mm-hmm but if

1181
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,299
you've seen like an Asian guy make you

1182
00:43:10,499 --> 00:43:14,519
know fun of black people for being black

1183
00:43:12,299 --> 00:43:17,430
and singing by people are undateable

1184
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:19,799
then that guy's career is probably done

1185
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:22,349
what did you think an Asian guy's saying

1186
00:43:19,799 --> 00:43:24,329
that I don't actually see more Asian

1187
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:26,549
people do this self-deprecating thing

1188
00:43:24,329 --> 00:43:29,430
where they make fun of how like Asian

1189
00:43:26,549 --> 00:43:30,839
guys yeah but I'm saying I know they're

1190
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:32,339
made I know I think we're I think we're

1191
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:34,710
still punching up though but they don't

1192
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:36,390
but Asian guy can't make fun of a black

1193
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:38,489
person yeah for being black but I think

1194
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:40,200
also it's because like black people have

1195
00:43:38,489 --> 00:43:41,579
kind of taken like though we get to make

1196
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:44,489
the race jokes it's everything because

1197
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:46,200
they've been so proficient in it they're

1198
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:49,619
very good at it they're very good at

1199
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:50,519
their jokes that is true yeah I'm just

1200
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:52,680
trying to figure out the totem pole

1201
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:55,470
they're just very observant and they

1202
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:57,410
know how to make it fun right but then

1203
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:59,609
where does that leave everybody else

1204
00:43:57,410 --> 00:44:06,150
struggling we got to talk about politics

1205
00:43:59,609 --> 00:44:08,329
and stuff okay well I somehow we we went

1206
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:11,249
from Avengers to like penis of the week

1207
00:44:08,329 --> 00:44:13,640
the week see we got back that we didn't

1208
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:16,140
do that in a while we haven't yeah yeah

1209
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:18,359
but now we're back I started

1210
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:20,279
so anyways in China yeah what about Game

1214
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:35,640
experiences and did you know some people

1215
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:37,040
just listening Derek just smiling the

1216
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:42,990
whole time

1217
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:45,030
[Music]

1218
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:47,100
I love living through Derek man cuz

1219
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:49,080
there's way hotter and like sexier than

1220
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:50,700
me and stuff and he's just like he

1221
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:52,950
always does cool stuff with like very

1222
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:55,470
pretty girls some house like hey Derek

1223
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:56,880
what happened but they're all down plays

1224
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:58,350
everything you know cuz he's very humble

1225
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,870
and stuff so he's like you know he's

1226
00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:04,050
hung out and kick it as like just hung

1227
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:06,120
out and kick it and it takes like 15 to

1228
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:08,070
40 minutes to get him to say like he's

1229
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:10,050
cuz you're asking him like that maybe

1230
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:11,010
yeah I'm kind of creepy

1231
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:12,270
yeah I wouldn't want to tell you

1232
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:16,530
anything either if you're asking me like

1233
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:21,810
that it's alright you kiss already like

1234
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:23,820
ignoring you yeah you know what is a I

1235
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:27,120
guess for you was the most fun thing you

1236
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:29,520
did in China though probably just meet

1237
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:31,500
people just meet different people around

1238
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,810
the world experience different

1239
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:37,590
situations and stuff out there compared

1240
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:39,840
to here performing again was was amazing

1241
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:41,790
that felt really good but you guys went

1242
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,700
to China together before and that sounds

1243
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:48,350
like a completely different situation

1244
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:53,190
yeah I was yeah we went to Beijing yeah

1245
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:54,870
we met and it was I'm not gonna lie it

1246
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:57,840
was not a fun experience I was one of my

1247
00:45:54,870 --> 00:46:00,000
least favorite trips and it was uh not

1248
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,630
no it's not not because of Derek it was

1249
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,270
um

1250
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:07,920
we none of what I mean Derek's Chinese

1251
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:09,840
right yeah but it's just the trip was

1252
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,760
rough for one every place we went

1253
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:13,080
because we couldn't speak Chinese we

1254
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,910
didn't have somebody like normally when

1255
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:16,020
we go out for events people accompanying

1256
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:18,210
us thick tape set us up with like a

1257
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:20,280
local or somebody we had no one so we're

1258
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:22,500
on our own for one just getting a taxi

1259
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:24,420
to go somewhere that we needed to be was

1260
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,470
a struggle because if we don't have

1261
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,790
somebody telling us this they're

1262
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:28,410
constantly we didn't know this at the

1263
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:30,030
time but they constitute our to rip you

1264
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:31,560
off like it's not like hey this is the

1265
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:33,540
set rate yeah they try and negotiate

1266
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,800
with you and we're like what it only

1267
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:36,990
costs us like I don't know what the

1268
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,340
currency was like 40 bucks to get there

1269
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:39,390
why are you saying it's gonna and we're

1270
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,230
in the middle of nowhere right because

1271
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:42,180
we don't know where we are

1272
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:43,770
why are you gonna charge us like a

1273
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:46,560
hundred bucks to go back like how was it

1274
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:47,850
gonna cost that much more and then we

1275
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,400
found out like oh you have to negotiate

1276
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:51,869
or you can negotiate and I think they

1277
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,810
knew that we couldn't speak Chinese so

1278
00:46:51,869 --> 00:46:55,830
like yeah he texted her we were talking

1279
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:57,810
to you because there's a line of them

1280
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:59,940
just kept telling people to skip us oh

1281
00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:01,830
yeah so we were like stranded there with

1282
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:03,780
this one guy and note we couldn't go to

1283
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:06,570
any other taxi driver so we ended up

1284
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:08,790
having to walk like hella far to get

1285
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:10,740
home taxi yeah and even that taxi was

1286
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:12,660
like where's your hotel we would say the

1287
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:14,190
name and he wouldn't know like yeah

1288
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:16,440
where that was and we didn't know if

1289
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:17,910
we're being scammed again so we end up

1290
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:21,030
getting dropped off in the middle of

1291
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:23,190
this like downtown area yeah and we had

1292
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:24,660
to just walk and look for it like on

1293
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:26,670
Google Matt we are phones don't really

1294
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:28,950
work ray can't call anyone yeah we we

1295
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:31,590
saw like a map on the street no Wi-Fi

1296
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:33,600
yeah and we just kind of like this looks

1297
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:34,890
like something familiar yeah kind of

1298
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:38,880
like that friends episode you put the

1299
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:40,890
map down you stand and yes I didn't have

1300
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,869
a good experience but apparently Macao

1301
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:44,340
is like the opposite of that

1302
00:47:42,869 --> 00:47:46,200
well yeah where I was at it was

1303
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:47,609
definitely like the Las Vegas Strip or

1304
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,590
it was a Las Vegas strip some of they

1305
00:47:47,609 --> 00:47:51,510
had some of the same hotels from here

1306
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:53,250
out there and you said it's like there

1307
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:56,160
because whatever what I've heard is that

1308
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:58,770
bad place is like stacked with cash like

1309
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:02,070
oh yeah hell of money they told me that

1310
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:05,670
um Macau is richer than Dubai and they

1311
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:08,070
told me that the ratio from Las Vegas to

1312
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:09,710
Macau is one to seven so any time an

1313
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:12,630
American spends a hundred bucks out here

1314
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:15,300
someone in Macau is spending seven

1315
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:17,119
hundred equal vient to that damn yeah

1316
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:19,440
it's pretty crazy yeah

1317
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:23,940
do they bet on fights and stuff like

1318
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:25,950
even watch that stuff I didn't see too

1319
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:28,020

1320
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:30,330

1321
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:31,800

1381
00:50:42,869 --> 00:50:45,599

1382
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:47,819

1383
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:50,400
getting out of the hotel or off the

1384
00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:52,589
stage and then I freaking ding his door

1385
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,079
it was it was a bad feeling I mean I

1386
00:50:52,589 --> 00:50:57,329
know most people like they think that's

1387
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:59,849
the dream right to have that level of

1388
00:50:57,329 --> 00:51:01,049
wealth yeah but like I would never I

1389
00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:03,900
don't think I would ever want to live a

1390
00:51:01,049 --> 00:51:05,519
life where I'm that rich like

1391
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:07,529
in the billions I really don't think

1392
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:08,640
that would be you you're not you're not

1393
00:51:07,529 --> 00:51:09,930
the same part in the same way like I

1394
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,839
would never want to be like Justin

1395
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:14,819
Bieber famous yeah or like at that level

1396
00:51:12,839 --> 00:51:17,039
mmm because at that point you can't live

1397
00:51:14,819 --> 00:51:18,180
a regular like some people might enjoy

1398
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:19,680
it some people do fine with it but

1399
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:22,380
there's a reason why a lot of those

1400
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:23,670
people who have everything still kill

1401
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:25,559
themselves they're still like depressed

1402
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:27,269
yeah because you can't live it's a whole

1403
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:29,549
nother way of living you got to change

1404
00:51:27,269 --> 00:51:31,230
your whole mindset everything and you're

1405
00:51:29,549 --> 00:51:33,779
almost it's almost like you're couldn't

1406
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:35,700
find to certain areas in a way because

1407
00:51:33,779 --> 00:51:37,950
you lose your freedom yes you're too

1408
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:39,749
famous right and and just being that

1409
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:41,099
rich to everybody you meet is gonna

1410
00:51:39,749 --> 00:51:43,109
treat you differently yeah for one you

1411
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:44,910
can't trust almost anyone that's true

1412
00:51:43,109 --> 00:51:46,920
not even family at that point right on

1413
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:48,829
time yeah yeah for the most part usually

1414
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:51,269
it is that way um unless you're just

1415
00:51:48,829 --> 00:51:53,579
born into it and everyone around you is

1416
00:51:51,269 --> 00:51:55,200
rich I think a lot of times it's you

1417
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:56,940
can't trust anyone because there's such

1418
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,930
a big it's such a powerful thing and I

1419
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:00,180
don't I don't think I would ever wanna

1420
00:51:57,930 --> 00:52:04,710
live that life I think you for like a

1421
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:06,930
day I like a week yeah I think I saw um

1422
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:10,589
I could be wrong but somebody who

1423
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:14,069
recently like won the lotto like had a

1424
00:52:10,589 --> 00:52:15,450
mask on right so nobody would like their

1425
00:52:14,069 --> 00:52:17,400
family wouldn't know that they're rich

1426
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:19,170
you know cuz like what you know it's

1427
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,279
hard to turn down family and it will

1428
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:21,509
change everything it would change

1429
00:52:20,279 --> 00:52:23,999
everything if you have the nicest family

1430
00:52:21,509 --> 00:52:25,380
members they know they know like oh you

1431
00:52:23,999 --> 00:52:26,910
didn't even we got dinner and you're not

1432
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:28,799
gonna pick up the bill yeah like it's

1433
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:30,989
just a hundred two hundred bucks like

1434
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:32,640
what is that to you like it just because

1435
00:52:30,989 --> 00:52:33,930
it changes the dynamic between people

1436
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,059
and I know that I mean like even I've

1437
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:38,220
met like hundreds of millionaires

1438
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:40,230
billionaires and I feel different around

1439
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:42,119
them like oh I know they feel different

1440
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:43,769
like I'm already thinking like how do I

1441
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:45,720
act because this is like a different

1442
00:52:43,769 --> 00:52:47,609
level and it's hard to even treat them

1443
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:50,039
like a human being sometimes yeah even

1444
00:52:47,609 --> 00:52:51,480
though you know I know I should I know

1445
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:53,640
what they're thinking like they have

1446
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:55,680
like a trust issue thing and yeah I

1447
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:58,109
don't know like I think that's an

1448
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:02,640
interesting dynamic uh and I think a lot

1449
00:52:58,109 --> 00:53:05,369
of fans like think like we're rich but

1450
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:08,069

dude I mean I've been trying to well I'm

1468
00:53:49,019 --> 00:53:52,950
not trying I haven't been I just thought

1469
00:53:51,329 --> 00:53:54,329
about growing it out okay and then I'd

1470
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:55,920
also thought about shaving it because

1471
00:53:54,329 --> 00:53:57,630
Paco made fun of me before you came

1472
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,309
really what do you say hey Mimi low self

1473
00:53:57,630 --> 00:54:00,690
conscious but he's like not like he was

1474
00:53:59,309 --> 00:54:03,809
with his friend and they came over

1475
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:04,769
earlier before you got here and he was

1476
00:54:03,809 --> 00:54:06,720
like oh can you take a picture of my

1477
00:54:04,769 --> 00:54:08,210
friends like oh oh yeah I guess I

1478
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:12,049
couldn't say oh you're not gonna shave

1479
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:14,160
it was even before that you said oh

1480
00:54:12,049 --> 00:54:16,109
you're gonna really grow it out like why

1481
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,099
who are you trying to appeal to like

1482
00:54:16,109 --> 00:54:18,779
what dumb are you trying to appeal to

1483
00:54:17,099 --> 00:54:21,299
cuz you can't even with all those

1484
00:54:18,779 --> 00:54:23,609
patches oh like I was like yeah I get a

1485
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:29,309
roasted first thing in the morning when

1486
00:54:23,609 --> 00:54:35,430
I see to it there's context to it

1487
00:54:29,309 --> 00:54:37,950
Oh shaver picture no because so whenever

1488
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:40,109
I ask him to be in my videos yeah if I

1489
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:41,819
don't let him know in advance and I ask

1490
00:54:40,109 --> 00:54:42,930
him day of and he did his shave he's

1491
00:54:41,819 --> 00:54:44,039
like aw do you shoulda let me know

1492
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:46,170
before so I could have shaved

1493
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:48,930
okay so every time I ask him he's always

1494
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:50,430
like I should have shaved so when he did

1495
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:51,869
it she only do that's why yeah I was

1496
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:54,420
like oh you're not gonna shave dude and

1497
00:54:51,869 --> 00:54:58,829
then mmm that was he's trying to make

1498
00:54:54,420 --> 00:55:00,599
himself some no making fun of me like I

1499
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:02,069
think I'd maybe I should shave that's

1500
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:02,910
right at first was like you're not gonna

1501
00:55:02,069 --> 00:55:04,650
shave he's like I'm thinking about

1502
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:07,019
growing out and then I went to get host

1503
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:08,999
and then he was like oh yeah but you got

1504
00:55:07,019 --> 00:55:10,529
all those patches like you know cuz I've

1505
00:55:08,999 --> 00:55:11,039
talked about it like I can't grow full

1506
00:55:10,529 --> 00:55:12,420
beer no sir

1507
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:14,940
yeah but maybe if I grow it long enough

1508
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:16,349
at all like cover up the spaces yeah but

1509
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,700
he just really didn't want me to do it

1510
00:55:16,349 --> 00:55:19,499
dude saying things like well what damn

1511
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:21,390
waiter can't you like your fans are

1512
00:55:19,499 --> 00:55:23,819

1513
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:25,319
right no but that's our friendship man

1514
00:55:23,819 --> 00:55:27,089
it's always like roast each other's

1515
00:55:25,319 --> 00:55:29,890
stuff I mean the patches look cool bro

1516
00:55:27,089 --> 00:55:31,660
thanks to you yeah it makes you unique

1517
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:34,210
yeah it gives me like some error over

1518
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:35,800
here why you so mad dude I thought that

1519
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:37,240
you know if you shave it more I think

1520
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,410
this is a myth when people say they

1521
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:41,110
shave it supposed to grow back thicker

1522
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:43,000
it doesn't work I shaved this I let grow

1523
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:44,890
and shave all the time hoping I'm gonna

1524
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,620
fill these patches one day and it just

1525
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:50,230
doesn't work dude I know how Sean did it

1526
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:52,630
and you're egging on well Gregan will

1527
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:54,610
have always hey that's true actually but

1528
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:56,860
you can't grow a beard huh that's a girl

1529
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:59,080
any hair anywhere the three of us can't

1530
00:55:56,860 --> 00:56:00,610
the three of them can their real hair

1531
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:03,250
it's just patchy yeah it doesn't look

1532
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:04,150
good you guys can't grow hair and I

1533
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:06,880
think that's like almost a blessing

1534
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:08,950
that's you don't have to shave as much

1535
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,630
or I'll have to shave cuz then mine will

1536
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:15,760
come out real quick and then chill there

1537
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:17,350
for like a little bit what like like

1538
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:19,270
mustache hair would like come out like

1539
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:20,920
the next day oh yeah well then just stay

1540
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:23,200
that length for like five days right

1541
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:24,790
like this people who are listening they

1542
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:28,000
can't see it's like stubble that is not

1543
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:29,470
in every spot so it looks stupid but if

1544
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,930
it was filled out it would look you know

1545
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:33,880
it look doh but to start it off you have

1546
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:36,520
to start from somewhere I know I know

1547
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:37,810
Sochi it's a life lesson for people emo

1548
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:39,550
is like even like when you're growing

1549
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:41,290
out your hair there's that phase where

1550
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:42,880
you look like an idiot and you will look

1551
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:45,880
like an idiot but if you commit to

1552
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:47,200
something you you might still look like

1553
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:49,660
an idiot but at leaders a chance you

1554
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:52,660
might not yeah people respect you a

1555
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:55,240
little bit anyways you have chess here

1556
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:57,070
though yeah I I do but it's like even

1557
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:59,260
that it's not like a like how you see on

1558
00:56:57,070 --> 00:57:02,260
like a movie yeah like that like an

1559
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:03,850

1561
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:07,570
face is sporadic yeah and it's just like

1562
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:09,340
I could easily just wax it and it'd be

1563
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:10,990
gone and like a you know it wouldn't be

1564
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:12,700
like a Steve Carell situation I got

1565
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:15,220
three hairs like I look like a cheek

nothing wrong I'm getting a massage did

1608
00:58:51,549 --> 00:59:00,640
you have to pay her something about the

1609
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:02,380
bass that I have to turn on my

1610
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:05,650
headphones it's like it makes me like

1611
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:06,999
earwax wiggle something I don't like

1612
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:09,700
about when you do that I think your

1613
00:59:06,999 --> 00:59:12,249
voice is so deep it II dude it's

1614
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:13,989
bothering me I think is just the basin

1615
00:59:12,249 --> 00:59:16,779
might hit my headphones in Japan though

1616
00:59:13,989 --> 00:59:20,229
yeah like people said like I had a

1617
00:59:16,779 --> 00:59:22,210
really nice low voice you do cuz I would

1618
00:59:20,229 --> 00:59:25,299
do like out speaking like Japanese to

1619
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:28,119
them but they'll be like Walkley Cucuy

1620
00:59:25,299 --> 00:59:30,940
which means cool yeah voices your voice

1621
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:33,579
is naturally very low thank you doesn't

1622
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:35,049
mean you need to force it or thank you

1623
00:59:33,579 --> 00:59:37,180
all you talk about the weird things you

1624
00:59:35,049 --> 00:59:39,190
were gonna do in Japan but dude I was in

1625
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:41,170
doubt I did chicken out man I was gonna

1626
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:43,180
do new do new do massages I was gonna go

1627
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:45,460
so plan explain is they even illegal

1628
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:47,529
like what is that what is that is legal

1629
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:49,119
you can explain I think it's okay to

1630
00:59:47,529 --> 00:59:51,219
talk about it cuz you didn't do it yeah

1631
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:52,310
essentially it's like it's a massage

1632
00:59:51,219 --> 00:59:55,970
parlor but

1633
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:58,010
the oil brothel they all you themselves

1634
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:59,360
up I think and then they just rub their

1635
00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:01,430
bodies on you it's like an erotic

1636
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:03,620
massage so they're massaging you with

1637
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:05,750
their whole body yeah that sounds like

1638
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:07,130
porn that's not really am assault like

1639
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:08,510
do they actually massage you I don't

1640
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:10,160
know I was hoping for a massage board

1641
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:13,190
that's my favorite thing that's cool

1642
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:16,100
yeah but then there I I didn't do that

1643
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:17,780
well yeah yeah why mostly because I was

1644
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:19,040
streaming the whole time and you can't

1645
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:22,190
like do that kind of stuff that's

1646
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:24,500
against TOS what's to us Terms of

1647
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:26,210
Service oh yeah you can't do that yeah

1648
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:27,590
cuz it's not like family go there though

1649
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:30,290
no mmm

1650
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:32,540
to an extent to an egg's what does it

1651
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:34,430
mean like they can rub themselves on you

1652
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:36,470
but as soon as like they touch like

1653
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:38,780
genitals and things and you're paying

1654
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:41,450
them for that that's like supposed to be

1655
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:43,550
not allowed that is silly to me like

1656
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:45,050
it's you're already rubbing a naked

1657
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:47,720
person's body on you and you're naked

1658
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:49,790
I'm assuming uh I don't I don't know I

1659
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:50,330
didn't really do performances that's so

1660
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:51,950
interesting

1661
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:54,620
yeah how do you guys feel about the

1662
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:57,920
legalization of we're not prostitution

1663
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:59,210
but I guess that is prostitution like

1664
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,010
sex there's a lot of people recently

1665
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:02,840
coming out like I saw in like even like

1666
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:05,330
Joe Rogan's podcast or like this has

1667
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:07,460
been around for ages since like early

1668
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:11,600
times prostitution yeah paid service

1669
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:13,640
yeah and it should be legalized in text

1670
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,600
mmm guessing the same with like like

1671
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:17,000
weed yeah

1672
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:18,950
but weed is becoming that yeah right and

1673
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,630
then like it's not even legal here

1674
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:23,990
prostitution but people think it is

1675
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:26,390
actually in different parts of Las Vegas

1676
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:28,250
there are really running brothels yeah I

1677
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:28,820
thought that was illegal yeah I've heard

1678
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:30,620
that before

1679
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:33,110
yeah there's certain ones in Vegas and

1680
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:35,360
really Nevada sorry none of that oh yeah

1681
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:38,030
yeah hey Gaston yeah people think it's

1682
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:39,680
are you I think Clark County is not

1683
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:42,800
legal but there are other counties that

1684
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:45,140
are right why I know this it's not

1685
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:49,310
because I've been to one it's just doing

1686
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:52,880
a research oh yeah jokes yeah what was

1687
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:54,890
it like no I didn't go in I said do mine

1688
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,870
he learned a lot of like sexual related

1689
01:01:54,890 --> 01:02:00,080
stuff because of Paco and he always says

1690
01:01:56,870 --> 01:02:01,220
research quote-unquote like the how

1691
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:03,020
about the fact and the weird is almost

1692
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:05,839
like hey remember one time oh actually

1693
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:08,210
guys the age of consent

1694
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:10,880
sixteen and like why do you know like

1695
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:12,920
why as a 27 year old or 28 year old man

1696
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:19,190
why do you need to know that like it's

1697
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:22,069
just like so so for me like I was a

1698
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:23,660
virgin until the age of 26 okay yeah

1699
01:02:22,069 --> 01:02:25,880
just maybe we'll put that out there in

1700
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:29,239
your 28 and I'm 28 now that's cool and

1701
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:31,729
uh so like a lot of times because people

1702
01:02:29,239 --> 01:02:35,869
make stupid jokes you know sure but I

1703
01:02:31,729 --> 01:02:37,609
want and they're like um Paco is like

1704
01:02:35,869 --> 01:02:39,799
you know he's so desperate whatever like

1705
01:02:37,609 --> 01:02:41,450
he like probably knows and like they

1706
01:02:39,799 --> 01:02:44,239
said like he knows that the legal age of

1707
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:47,359
consent is 16 in Las Vegas and I was

1708
01:02:44,239 --> 01:02:50,029
like what like I thought it was 18 you

1709
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:51,710
know throughout the entire country but

1710
01:02:50,029 --> 01:02:53,799
apparently it isn't like different

1711
01:02:51,710 --> 01:02:55,849
states have different ages consent

1712
01:02:53,799 --> 01:02:57,440
supposedly like in Japan like a

1713
01:02:55,849 --> 01:03:00,079
Prefecture has like the legal age of

1714
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:04,670
consent is 13 what yeah

1715
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:06,589
damn 13 where I don't know exactly where

1716
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:08,660
now this is all word of mouth of course

1717
01:03:06,589 --> 01:03:10,400
I could be wrong so simple google search

1718
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:13,009
a simple Google search good work all

1719
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:16,789
right go on um but yeah and then there's

1720
01:03:13,009 --> 01:03:18,710
like uh like if they're under the legal

1721
01:03:16,789 --> 01:03:21,589
age of consent but you're within five

1722
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:23,930
years of their age in certain states

1723
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:25,819
like that's okay you know because if

1724
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:30,109
you're 18 and your boyfriend or

1725
01:03:25,819 --> 01:03:33,589
girlfriend is 17 and you guys make love

1726
01:03:30,109 --> 01:03:34,729
or whatever ah and that person like it

1727
01:03:33,589 --> 01:03:37,369
would be weird if that person went to

1728
01:03:34,729 --> 01:03:41,059
jail for that it's 13 in Japan 14 in

1729
01:03:37,369 --> 01:03:43,219
China yes the age of consent is 12 in

1730
01:03:41,059 --> 01:03:46,700
the Philippines oh my gosh

1731
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:48,170
Wow that's crazy yeah they I don't think

1732
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:50,779
they had drinking ages out there any

1733
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:52,609
they're you could drink it like any age

1734
01:03:50,779 --> 01:03:55,910
out there I heard something about that

1735
01:03:52,609 --> 01:03:57,229
though like was it like France or

1736
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:58,460
something where they don't have a

1737
01:03:57,229 --> 01:04:01,640
drinking age or just like really young

1738
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:04,369
and because that's allowed there there's

1739
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:06,170
like significantly like less alcoholism

1740
01:04:04,369 --> 01:04:08,210
and do you I really like alcohol-related

1741
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:09,529
incidents I don't know if that's true it

1742
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:11,089
was really good they know I did

1743
01:04:09,529 --> 01:04:13,819
something like maybe I'm a younger age

1744
01:04:11,089 --> 01:04:15,079
or you just don't crave it or maybe it's

1745
01:04:13,819 --> 01:04:16,819
just less reported because there's less

1746
01:04:15,079 --> 01:04:18,619
underage drinking since there's nothing

1747
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:20,960
maybe they get

1748
01:04:18,619 --> 01:04:22,249
their system earlier true so you don't

1749
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:24,170
know they don't have to be with it later

1750
01:04:22,249 --> 01:04:26,630
whereas here in America you know you

1751
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:28,460
can't drink 321 so people who want a

1752
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:30,619
drink once it hit 21 and they wanted to

1753
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:33,680
wise yourself yeah that's that was kind

1754
01:04:30,619 --> 01:04:35,089
of me I really went crazy 20 even like

1755
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:36,380
clubbing and stuff like that although

1756
01:04:35,089 --> 01:04:39,739
I've been to clubs cause of like events

1757
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:42,829
and stuff but at 21 I had like a six

1758
01:04:39,739 --> 01:04:44,779
month spree of just like doing little to

1759
01:04:42,829 --> 01:04:46,789
no work and just like going straight

1760
01:04:44,779 --> 01:04:49,400
clubbing and stuff yes and I've always I

1761
01:04:46,789 --> 01:04:51,469
learned how much I hated it like that's

1762
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:53,329
and now and now I got it out of my

1763
01:04:51,469 --> 01:04:57,309
system I don't have any craving ever to

1764
01:04:53,329 --> 01:04:57,309
go again we should go again okay yeah

1765
01:04:57,489 --> 01:05:01,789

1766
01:05:00,109 --> 01:05:04,190
my eople I like going out I don't like

1767
01:05:01,789 --> 01:05:05,869

1768
01:05:04,190 --> 01:05:09,650

1769
01:05:05,869 --> 01:05:11,210

that is me at parties I just like I

1771
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:16,640
people watch a lot really yeah

1772
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:19,099
it's situational for me it's a very

1773
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:20,150
situational for me yeah I feel like

1774
01:05:19,099 --> 01:05:22,219
normally you like to be the center of

1775
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:24,200
attention if I know everyone there and I

1776
01:05:22,219 --> 01:05:25,940
you know or most people there then I'll

1777
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:28,069
