00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,030
hey guys so for those of you that don't

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:04,770
know I've been making YouTube videos for

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,600
about eight years now and a lot has

4
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,710
changed since then both good and bad but

5
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,480
today I'm gonna be talking about one of

6
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,950
the bad ones because I'm a pretty

7
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,630
pessimistic person I'm pretty negative

8
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,130
some people see the glass half full some

9
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,540
people see the glass half-empty for me

10
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm so negative I don't even see the

11
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,449
glass anymore oh no wait it's still have

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,510
full mmm I just realize what this looks

13
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,980
like the letter C anyway I'm gonna be

14
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,599
talking about one of the bad changes

15
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,099
that I've noticed that is definitely on

16
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,630
the rise on YouTube which happens to be

17
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,300

23
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:47,760
dramatic fashion usually starting with

24
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,520

33
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:06,960
problem because it's all over the news

34
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,770

made a racist no my father was killed by

49
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,079
a tweet you get the point

50
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,610
don't get me wrong easily butthurt

51
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,079
people have always existed they're also

52
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,310
known as overly sensitive people I'm

53
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,570
sure you know exactly what kind of

54
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,829
people I'm talking about and maybe it's

55
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,299
just me but I feel like over the years

56
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:56,219
people have gotten more and more easily

57
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,659
butthurt over everything especially on

58
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:59,070
YouTube YouTube used to be a place where

59
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,180
you could upload whatever you wanted we

60
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,710
uploaded things that we are passionate

61
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,969
about we could say whatever you wanted

62
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,649
to say it was like the opposite of

63
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:05,700
television it was freedom but over the

64
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:07,049
years I notice that YouTube is becoming

65
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,550
more and more like television where you

66
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:10,110
have to be really careful with what you

67
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,450
say because everything you say is gonna

68
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,950
be used against you and it's

69
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,120
fend something we can't say or do

70
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,769
anything on YouTube anymore without a

71
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,209
bunch of people being so dramatic thing

72
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:18,890
is I don't even think these people are

73
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:20,030
actually offended half the time I think

74
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,349
they believe that it's supposed to

75
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,180
offend them so they act that way but

76
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,349
really doesn't even bother them or maybe

77
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,090
they just say these things so people

78
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:27,290
agree with them for example I posted a

79
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,030
video a couple weeks ago and there's a

80
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,470
joke in it that mentions Ebola and the

81
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,910
thing is if there wasn't so much news

82
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,319
and articles about Ebola right now

83
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,610
nobody would have cared about that joke

84
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,810
at least majority of the people wouldn't

85
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,310
have been offended but because it's a

86
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:39,080
turning topic and scary to people it's

87
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,220
all of a sudden so offensive and for

88
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,810
those of you who haven't seen that video

89
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,480
this is what the joke looked like if a

90
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,590
girl that small were to kill me how what

91
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,959
the hell do there

92
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:50,510
Ebola now you really have seven days no

93
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:52,430
why I even told you and from that little

94
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:54,170
mention of Ebola I got so many upset

95
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,549
comments saying things like that is so

96
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,470
offensive people are dying from Ebola

97
00:02:55,549 --> 00:02:58,910
now it's not a joke yeah making fun of a

98
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,920
deadly virus is so funny you're such a

99
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,150
bad example for kids see I understand

100
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,530
when you first see this how you could

101
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,299
think it's offensive cuz it's a serious

102
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,950
topic in a comedy video think about it

103
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:08,390
does that really offend you or do you

104
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,280
just think it should first of all it's

105
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:12,079
one joke in a fictional scene on a

106
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,790
comedy video on YouTube and even if it

107
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:15,470
did does that joke honestly hurt you or

108
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:17,660
offend you in any way because if it does

109
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,920
I apologize sincerely I did not mean to

110
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,209
offend you in any way it wasn't meant to

111
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,950
be offensive but if you really do get

112
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:23,569
offended that easily you should probably

113
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,100
stay off the internet because you're

114
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:26,389
gonna have a bad time Ebola is not

115
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,799
something new it's been around for a

116
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:29,060
long time just because something is all

117
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:30,829
of a sudden in the news it doesn't make

118
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,389
it any less or more deadly than it was

119
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:33,680
before I made that same joke a year ago

120
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:34,970
I'm pretty sure nobody would have cared

121
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,170
because it wasn't a trending topic there

122
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,609
or if I were to switch out the word

123
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,019
Ebola with something else that's deadly

124
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:40,760
like arsenic people wouldn't have even

125
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,769
mentioned it and injecting arsenic is

126
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,120
just as deadly if not more deadly you

127
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:45,739
would even have seven days to live you

128
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,239
died that day and last if mentioning

129
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:48,920
Ebola in a YouTube video is a bad

130
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:50,389
example for kids just because it's a

131
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,459
deadly virus and what about children

132
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:54,170
shows like Tom and Jerry that entire

133
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:55,819
children's show is about a cat trying to

134
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:57,170
murder a mouse but I guess attempted

135
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,700
murder is not that bad right because

136
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,989
it's not in the news but it is or what

137
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,549
about Pokemon that's a bunch of people

138
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,989
who are capturing wild animals and

139
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:04,040
keeping them captive in a little ball

140
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:05,930
raising them until they're strong enough

141
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,730
to fight other animal sounds like animal

142
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,560
cruelty to me or even spongebob there's

143
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,389
not much violence in that one but it's

144
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,950
very sexually inappropriate for kids

145
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:14,480
come on they live in bikini bottom and

146
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,190
there's somebody named Sandy Cheeks in

147
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,660
bikini bottom and also there's a mr.

148
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,950
Krabs in bikini bottom don't even get me

149
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,390
started on Squidward's nose

150
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,769
childhood ruined and like I said these

151
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:24,580
are all children's shows Burt

152
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:27,050
and me because I watch them occasionally

153
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,460
sometimes okay I watch them all the time

154
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,449
so well you easily butthurt people out

155
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,740
there the next time you feel like

156
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:32,180
something is offensive to you asked

157
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,830
yourself this does this really bother

158
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,060
you does it actually offend you or are

159
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,229
you just thinking that because you feel

160
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,759
like you should be offended even though

161
00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:38,900
you're really not and also because you

162
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,949
want to make a point to the rest of your

163
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,880
butthurt friends can thumbs up your

164
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:42,289
comment because if that's the case

165
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,150
you're one of the main reasons why

166
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:45,919
YouTube is becoming a butthurt place and

167
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,949
it's a real pain in the ass pun not

168
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,509
intended but intended seriously let me

169
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:52,250
just go back to the fun YouTube

170
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:53,900
community that it once was I know that

171
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,060
was a long time ago about eight years I

172
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,550
was like 15 or 16 I'm getting old now

173
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,380
I'm 24 I'm about to die wow that is

174
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,120
really offensive what you just said

175
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,650
you're 24 and you're about to die that's

176
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,210
really offensive to everyone older than

177
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,979
it was a joke that is not something you

178
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:09,759
should joke about you should never never

179
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:12,500
joke about that

180
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,139
Never Say Never

181
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,789
oh so now you're supporting guns and old

182
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:18,199
outdated Justin Beiber references that's
