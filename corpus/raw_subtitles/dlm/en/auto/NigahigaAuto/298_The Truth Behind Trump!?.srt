that oh how did that work out we just

30
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,240
spent two hours looking through these

31
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:10,009
Lilian only took me an hour to write why

32
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,840
Holly because most of it was copy and

33
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:13,250
paste so why did you make us do this

34
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,660
well if you would just have a seat and

35
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,430
let me explain instead of wasting

36
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:19,610
everyone's time now you're concerned

37
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:21,470
with wasting people's time so now that

38
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,360
everybody's settled in prepared

39
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:27,530
yourselves what I'm about to tell you is

40
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:29,930
something so shocking so mind-blowing so

41
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,729
incredibly secretive that even me saying

42
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:34,160
it out loud right now could get us all

43
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:36,649
then don't say it oh don't say that it's

44
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,580
gonna put us in danger danger no I was

45
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:40,039
just saying that if I say it all out

46
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,270
right now it could get us all to be

47
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:42,740
closer because then we'd have like a

48
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,880
really cool secret together you know and

49
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,399
then we could get friendship necklaces

50
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,170
like these those are ties what does any

51
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,090
of that have to do with trunk get to the

52
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,770
point already fine you wonder why me and

53
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:54,860
Sean have these and you don't yes that's

54
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:56,929
why you say nothing today I am gonna be

55
00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:01,599
revealing the truth behind none other

56
00:01:56,929 --> 00:02:01,599
than our president in Donald J

57
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:11,150
that's the graduation song oh so you're

58
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,290
probably wondering what truth is there

59
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,640
to learn about our president because

60
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,230
there's so many questions about it like

61
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,849
for one why would a billionaire want to

62
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,709
be president in the first place is it to

63
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:20,599
actually make America great again or is

64
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:22,160
it to benefit himself and his businesses

65
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,629
or maybe it's just to boost his own ego

66
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,040
everyone has their own opinions and for

67
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:26,989
some reason the majority of those

68
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,540
opinions seem to be pretty negative gee

69
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:30,920
I wonder why why well in order to find

70
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,450
out the truth that's the first thing we

71
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,370
need to do we need to ask ourselves why

72
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:36,470
do so many people hate the guy isn't it

73
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,450
pretty obvious the things he says the

74
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,879
things he does he mocked a disabled

75
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:42,200
person like who does that exactly no one

76
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,700
does that especially when you know

77
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,680
you're being watched by the entire world

78
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:48,019
and we all know Trump loves to be loved

79
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,720
so why would he do that because he just

80
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:52,700
doesn't get it get what people humans

81
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,319
it's almost like he doesn't realize and

82
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,150
the things he says and does are not

83
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,709
things that people normally say and do

84
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,540
the guy is different and not just a

85
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:01,099
little different he's very different the

86
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,540
way he acts the way he speaks even the

87
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:04,160
way he looks but we just here to roast

88
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,200
Trump because everyone already does that

89
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,519
oh not at all then just tell us because

90
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,310
I don't see what you're trying to get at

91
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:13,190
what I'm trying to say is that I truly

92
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:15,519
believe that our president Donald Trump

93
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,519
is

94
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:23,440
an alien but it makes everything make

95
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,210
sense you said it yourself he does

96
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,620
things that no humans would thing to do

97
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,970
like mocking that disabled person on

98
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,680
national television that's because he

99
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,850
said it said sit avidity or is it

100
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,470
because he just doesn't understand

101
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,030
humans and when humans consider right

102
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,410
and wrong and normal and weird just like

103
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,090
that one time he had that interview on

104
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:38,350
the view i've said that if Ivanka

105
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:42,850
weren't my daughter perhaps I'd be

106
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:44,320
dating her see and when everyone else

107
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,180
left he just didn't understand why that

108
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,740
was weird when it should be obvious to

109
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,820
any normal human that that's not

110
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,210
something you say about your own

111
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,920
daughter

112
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:52,360
especially on national television just

113
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,800
because he's weird doesn't mean he's an

114
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,000
alien what about his appearance there's

115
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,620
a reason why people are constantly

116
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,090
pointing out things about his looks like

117
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,770
why is his skin orange that's not a

118
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,840
normal human color people with spray

119
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,280
tans are the exact same color what about

120
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,480
his hair people make fun of his hair all

121
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,950
the time because it doesn't look like

122
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,720
normal human hair it looks like some

123
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,520
kind of wig he's old old people wear

124
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,290
wigs but it's not a wig and even if it

125
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,180
were out of all the wigs he could have

126
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,860
chose he picks that one that hair is not

127
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,810
a choice a normal human would make oh

128
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,430
people make fun of his hands being small

129
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,440
see he's not consistent with human

130
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,480
proportions either oh and he always

131
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,780
wears that big red friendship necklace

132
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:28,150
not too sure if that's one Shawn but the

133
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,900
hand thing that was good this is so

134
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,700
stupid

135
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,160
stupid what if Donald Trump's favorite

136
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,980
word's along with weak loser wrong smart

137
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,630
top bad huge yes for all aware of how

138
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,060
illiterate he is at his minuscule

139
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,680
vocabulary many school vocabulary it's

140
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:44,560
not like a school with like tiny books

141
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,760
oh for his tiny hands see I personally

142
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,350
think it's messed up that people like

143
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,490
you make fun of his basic English just

144
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:50,020
like making fun of an immigrant for

145
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,730
having an accent or speaking funny you

146
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,990
go try and learn a new alien language

147
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:55,600
and see if you can remember complex

148
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,130
difficult huge alien words you actually

149
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,350
think Donald Trump was an alien just

150
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:02,520
because he talks acts and looks a little

151
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:05,140
different I wish that's all I knew

152
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,760
Donald Trump was born in 1946 which is a

153
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,800
very important year for alien conspiracy

154
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,770
theories Speer C theorists you mean

155
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,540
crazies one year before all the activity

156
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,220
Roswell exactly Roswell one of the most

157
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,750
infamous alien incidents that's ever

158
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,250
been recorded in history but you know

159
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,750
what that's not the only one then right

160
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,730
right there two more in Washington that

161
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,710
same year Mount Rainier Mari island Wow

162
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,800
yeah that's right how do you know all

163
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:29,180
this but you don't know the word

164
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,030
miniscule well I went to a regular-sized

165
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:33,500
one you see alien sightings happen all

166
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,520
the time but these three cases were

167
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,320
singled out as some of the most

168
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,410
evidential cases of all time and they

169
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:43,130
all happened in 1947 a year after Donald

170
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:45,500
Trump was born first as we already know

171
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:47,360
Roswell New Mexico where a rancher found

172
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,970
actual physical evidence of a spacecraft

173
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,440
before eventually got covered up then

174
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,690
the Mount Rainier Washington incident

175
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,460
where our pilots saw actual UFOs while

176
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,660
he was flying in the sky only later to

177
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,160
find out that people on the ground

178
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,660
actually saw the same thing and finally

179
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,040
the Mauri Island incident where a sailor

180
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,690
couldn't they saw things but later

181
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,160
retracted their statement after a

182
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,690
mysterious man in a black suit

183
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,920
approached him and told him not to talk

184
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,960
about the incident eventually in this

185
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,340
specific incident actually inspired the

186
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,710
men in black movies to be made don't you

187
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,540
guys see a pattern here yes in 1947

188
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,250
people were very gullible nope that's

189
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,900
absolutely wrong Shawn there is a

190
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:21,200
pattern all the people who saw these

191
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:23,960
things they all saw them in 1947 the

192
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:26,120
same year well yeah well yes that's

193
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,220
that's true as well but there's there's

194
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,540
another pattern as well think about all

195
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,640
the people who made the sightings in

196
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,740
Roswell it was a rancher in Mount

197
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,840
Rainier it was a pilot and the Mariana

198
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:39,260
incident was a sailor it's earth air and

199
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,030
water like the Avatar what a rancher who

200
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,590
represents earth a pilot who represents

201
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,240
air and of course a sailor which

202
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,130
represents water but what about fire

203
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,480
isn't that a thing - well before Trump

204
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,280
started running for office what was his

205
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,610
most infamous phrase you're fired you're

206
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,930
fired

207
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,480
goodbye you're fired you're fired

208
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:57,230
Hillary you're fired he's a firebender

209
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:59,270
not just that Donald Trump is the avatar

210
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:01,160
are you kidding me is if this wasn't

211
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:03,230
stupid enough now you try to convince me

212
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,120
that Trump is based off of a cartoon not

213
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:07,340
at all see if the cartoon was based off

214
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,150
of him and what he represents oh yeah

215
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,220
what's that

216
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:12,290
world peace just like the show is based

217
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,610
off of earth air water fire they all

218
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,449
represent different nations all

219
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:17,129
different parts of the world long ago

220
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:18,900
all these parts live together in harmony

221
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:20,759
and then the Avatar disappeared and

222
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,590
conflicts began fights and battles

223
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:23,819
became normal Wars broke on and began to

224
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,379
become more and more dangerous from

225
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:27,059
World War one escalating all the way to

226
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:28,889
world war ii when the first atomic bomb

227
00:07:27,059 --> 00:07:30,389
the deadliest weapon in existence was

228
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:32,279
used and then the war ended and there

229
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:34,199
hasn't been a world war or atomic bomb

230
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:38,610
use since and what year did all of this

231
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:40,949
end 1945 one year before Donald J Trump

232
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,419
was born hey why does he keep making

233
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:44,309
these funny years he's trying to imply

234
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:45,719
that Donald Trump wasn't born then

235
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:48,240
because he wasn't that's just the day

236
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:50,129
that he Donald Trump the alien avatar

237
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,990
came back and restored balance to the

238
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:54,479
world and although he has a lot to learn

239
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:58,219
before he can save anyone I believe that

240
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,219
Donald can save the world

241
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:05,009
this in your head you need to fix that

242
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:06,839
you need help both of you yes we all do

243
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:08,819
we and we have that help in Donald Trump

244
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:10,409
we are on the verge of another world war

245
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:12,180
and that's why Donald Trump finally

246
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:13,529
after all these years decided to run for

247
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,210
president to bring peace back to the

248
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:16,649
world people suspect and are currently

249
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:18,360
investigating Donald Trump for having

250
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:20,909
ties to Russia I believe he does and he

251
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,009
has since 1947 a year after his birth

252
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:24,749
right when the Cold War began thankfully

253
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:26,939
it was a war of ideas and not an actual

254
00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:28,439
war all thanks to one year old Donald

255
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:30,180
Trump keeping the peace between the two

256
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:32,399
strongest nations in the world the time

257
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:36,360
the Soviet Union MB us that's his secret

258
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,459
tie with Russia so funny you your logic

259
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,620
can you hear yourself

260
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:43,199
yeah I'm not deaf you're saying Donald

261
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,269
Trump's goal in life is to connect the

262
00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:47,040
world and provide a world peace I mean

263
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:49,230
he does own the Miss Universe pageant

264
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,699
and world peace is of pretty reoccurring

265
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,500
theme the same Donald Trump that is

266
00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:54,329
obsessed with separating countries by

267
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,680
building gigantic wall

268
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:57,060
oh you mean great walls like the Great

269
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,350
Wall of China which if you haven't

270
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,899
noticed he's already trying to build

271
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:03,209
ties with China China China China China

272
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:05,790
China I get it regardless it's still a

273
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:07,350
wall and wall separating true but the

274
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,839
great wall is not just the wall it's

275
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:11,170
also a pathway and pathways connect

276
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,269
things

277
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,619
oh my God look I found it hard to

278
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:16,029
believe at first too that's why it took

279
00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:17,769
me so long to make this video didn't why

280
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:20,170
now well obviously because the whole

281
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:21,999
news of the Olympics duh huh why it's

282
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:23,739
the Olympics they've recently announced

283
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:26,199
that in 2028 the Olympics are coming

284
00:09:23,739 --> 00:09:27,910
back to the US so the Olympics are

285
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:29,230
literally made to bring peace and unity

286
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,149
between all the different nations of the

287
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,829
world it's the exact symbol of what

288
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:34,929
Trump wants and it's finally coming back

289
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:37,809
to the u.s. in 2028 again

290
00:09:34,929 --> 00:09:40,059
so what oh my gosh do I actually have to

291
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:41,439
draw this out for you yes fine like I

292
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:43,419
said before the Olympics are gonna be

293
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:45,669
back in the US in 2028 the last time

294
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:47,559
they were in the US was in 1996 in

295
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:48,970
Atlanta if we lay out a continuous map

296
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:50,889
of the world and place out each of the

297
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:53,019
location in order starting from 1996 in

298
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:55,329
Atlanta to Sydney Australia in 2000

299
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:57,339
degrees in Oh Fort Riley no way London

300
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:58,899
in 2012 found to Brazil for the most

301
00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:00,759
recent Olympics all the way back over to

302
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:02,230
Japan for the next Olympics in 2020 and

303
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:04,209
from there here's where it gets a little

304
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,859
tricky the 2024 Olympics haven't been

305
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:07,959
announced yet but we suspect it's gonna

306
00:10:05,859 --> 00:10:09,309
be somewhere around Paris friends there

307
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:11,410
we head all the way back to the US for

308
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:13,059
the Olympics in 2028 and there you have

309
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,949
it if you take a step back and look at

310
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:17,709
it as a whole what do you see I don't

311
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:19,660
know intersecting lime triangles the

312
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:20,410
Illuminati Israel that's a different

313
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,299
video China

314
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,610
oh well what is it then what you see

315
00:10:22,299 --> 00:10:27,759
here is exactly what you never see Trump

316
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:29,860
without a big red time the friendship

317
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:31,749
necklace once again groovy that just

318
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,449
like the Olympics just like the avatar

319
00:10:31,749 --> 00:10:37,949
Donald Trump the alien is trying to tie

320
00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:37,949
the entire world

321
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:48,640
[Music]

322
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,140
wedding storms hey actually I have one

323
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,090
last question yeah the only thing I

324
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,710
don't get is that if Trump is here for

325
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:55,630
all of these great things why does he

326
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:57,520
hide it from everyone that's the only

327
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:59,350
thing you don't get well see that's the

328
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,820
even greater truth about something no

329
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:02,620
one can find out because if they did

330
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,300
they realize he's an alien and they'd

331
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,440
freak out but he's a good alien he wants

332
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,720
to save and protect the world right now

333
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,510
but we are still human it's really

334
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,340
stupid stupid humans so even if Trump

335
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:14,110
were to tie and connect every single

336
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,330
nation and prevent every possible future

337
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:17,980
world war and world hunger poop gold

338
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:20,020
even if Trump were to actually achieve

339
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:23,250
actual world peace it wouldn't matter

340
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:26,860
what why well the greater truth is

341
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:30,720
Fuzzy's an alien an undocumented illegal

342
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,720
alien he's got to go home
