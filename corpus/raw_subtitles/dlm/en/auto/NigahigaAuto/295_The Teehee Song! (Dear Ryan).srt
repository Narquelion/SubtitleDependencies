Jamel Noah I definitely know what it's

15
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,500
like to follow a celebrity or a youtuber

16
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,030
they know they create a product and all

17
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,530
of a sudden their whole entire life and

18
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,969
everything they post about is about that

19
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,559
product Conor McGregor used to have

20
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,239
funny tweets and plenty like Instagram

21
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,410
stories and stuff that made his whiskey

22
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,059
and everything was above that I actually

23
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,860
almost had fallen because it was

24
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,539
literally just about his whiskey and

25
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,129
that is kind of what I'm doing for the

26
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,180
moment but don't worry I'm not gonna be

27
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:49,530
doing that for it's just cuz we just

28
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,750
launched but with that being said yeah

29
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,879

30
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,559

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,149
to break even but seriously thank you to

32
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,500
everybody who did order back to the deer

33
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,000

34
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,590
arrived because I'm gonna be giving away

35
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,120
secrets thanks to this first year Ryan

36
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,830
dear Ryan can you make a video showing

37
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,600
us how deer Ryan's are actually chosen

38
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,460
that one had no likes teach us the

39
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,689
algorithm I'm just to break it down even

40
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,610
simpler for you guys so you understand

41
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,110
the way I think D Ryan's are not

42
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,340
necessarily always because I like when I

43
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,530
feel like doing it you're Ryan video I'd

44
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,180
go to addy Ryan not only the most recent

45
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,740
but the past year Ryan videos you can

46
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,360
check the comments I think screenshots

47
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,130
of all the deer Ryan's that have you

48
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,780
know tons of up votes and tons of life

49
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,250
but a lot of time even those your riser

50
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,259
there a lot of are very much the same

51
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,400
like the same ones over and over not see

52
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,780
sometimes they're really good ones and

53
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,220
really interesting ones but I would say

54
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,380
a majority of the time they're things

55
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,759
that I think I've already done or done

56
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,110
something very similar to it or it's

57
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,340
just something I don't want to do or

58
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,390
it's just I don't think it's gonna be

59
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,439
entertaining I know because it has

60
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,509
something likes it means people want to

61
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,890
see me do it I just I'm selfish I just

62
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:45,450
do the ones that I want to do all of

63
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,890
today's D Ryan's are gonna be ones that

64
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,939
you guys want to see because it's the

65
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,710
ones with the most likes

66
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,060

85
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,060
yeah this just go down the street so we

86
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,440
don't bother these people alright so we

87
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,550
actually went to the end of the street I

88
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,750
didn't realize that there was gonna be

89
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,740
construction workers and I don't want to

90
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,000
be screaming and then they think

91
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,760
something's wrong who do we go a little

92
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,380
bit further all right so we are a little

93
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,540
bit of a hike away from the houses I

94
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,700
think we're good you know what birds I

95
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,020
don't want to disrupt them I don't want

96
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,330
to issues with PETA so maybe we should

97
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,280
just like a couple more miles okay I

98
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,040
think this is good I mean we're a few

99
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,990
miles away from anything I don't hear

100
00:02:50,040 --> 00:03:00,290
any birds so yeah it's pretty wide open

101
00:02:51,990 --> 00:03:06,290
yes we're good can you keep it down

102
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:06,290
you're not the only one out here sorry

103
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:11,640
hey we could go a little bit further do

104
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:14,459
you Ryan why are you so talented I mean

105
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,390
I guess some people are just born with

106
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,390
gifts yeah

107
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:45,890
I don't know how to that happening are

108
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,000
they trying to do it you're right you

109
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:50,510
and your friends pretend to be each

110
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,640
other for a whole day hey guys nice I

111
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,080
just got this dear Ryan and asking if

112
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,240
you and your friends could be each other

113
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,640
for an entire day you guys down

114
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,790
oh yeah I'll be dead I guess I'll be

115
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,710
Greg no and then I'll be will oh but I

116
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,990
mean who's gonna be me then and Who am I

117
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:10,360
gonna oh I thought you said we were

118
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:10,360
supposed to pretend to be our friends

119
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:26,720
what my only friends are men are my dogs

120
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:29,600
so we kind of see you more as like an

121
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,350
owner type of figure than a friend that

122
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,270
makes sense

123
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:34,340
do you write when you prove that one

124
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,620
plus one is not equal to two

125
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:40,880
see this one is just dumb like one thing

126
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:43,490
another thing always makes two unless

127
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,020
one Apple with another Apple you just

128
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,820
got two apples one plus one equals two

129
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,230
Michael if you had one cup of water and

130
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,030
you had another cup of water and you

131
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:52,310
added that together you still got one

132
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,930
cup of water just a bigger one proving

133
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:56,210
that one plus one doesn't always have to

134
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:57,980
equal two it's just a bigger one show

135
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:00,410
that to your math teacher dear Ryan can

136
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,700
you do a face reveal I actually had to

137
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,260
just google it because I didn't know

138
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,900
what the hell a facial is and apparently

139
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:07,670
it's a trend on YouTube where youtubers

140
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,740
who've never shown their face before I

141
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:11,840
guess aren't showing their faces for the

142
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,490
first time on video I'm not sure how I

143
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,220
would be able to do that because you

144
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,210
know I I you've seen my face before but

145
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,410
then I realized there is something I

146
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:20,000
actually could reveal since I'm just

147
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,560
releasing all the secrets on to you Ryan

148
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,030
I might as well keep releasing more

149
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,620
secrets guys there's another person that

150
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,140
makes appearances on this channel and

151
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:29,210
you may recognize her from skin cells or

152
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:31,040
others random skits as the real dumb one

153
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,960
yes I'm talking about Regina and I know

154
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,600
this might come across as a little

155
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,230
shocking to a lot of you but both Regina

156
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,870
and myself

157
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:48,690
well we're actually the same person

158
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:50,460
that's right there is no lying ah see

159
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:52,320
now you don't have to worry about how

160
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:56,940
dear Ryan's are chosen because there is

161
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:59,190
no Ryan's just me your dear Regina tune

162
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:04,860
in next time for a special episode of

163
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:06,540
dear Regina it's Regina Regina dear

164
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,850
right you make a whole song using only

165
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,800
the word TV ever since I started this

166
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,210
show dear Ryan I think over the course

167
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,920
of a I don't know how many years that

168
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,540
has been the most common one I've ever

169
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,760
gotten and the most the one with the

170
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,740
most likes and upvotes has been this

171
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,990
making a song out of the out of my

172
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,340
teehee and I'm not sure why everyone

173
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,140
wants to see that I guess because that's

174
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,970
what I'm most associated with is the

175
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,680
word teehee I'm just warning I never did

176
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,960
this one because I know it's not gonna

177
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,910
be good but I guess I'll just do a bunch

178
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,910
of T's and see what I can come up with

179
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,070
all right let's see what we can make

180
00:06:46,530 --> 00:07:00,309
[Music]

181
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:00,309
[Applause]
