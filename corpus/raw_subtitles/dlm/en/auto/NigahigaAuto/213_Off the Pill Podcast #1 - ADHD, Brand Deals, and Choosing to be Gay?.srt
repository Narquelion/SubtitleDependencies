20
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:53,129
video yeah anyway welcome to the first

21
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,140
off the pill podcast it's not the it's

22
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:56,789
not the first one I'm a liar it's not

23
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,670
the first one we've done we've done -

24
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:03,359
actually we've done three I posted two

25
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,159
on the second channel one was with just

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,310
us I think and then we did one with

27
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,080
David David Choi a lot of you guys

28
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,390
really liked it but we stopped doing it

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,530
for a very long time oh yeah I'm sorry

30
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:18,560
there's a third one that we did with

31
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:20,759
Derek but I don't was unsalvageable

32
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,830
it's Derek you know we went a little

33
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,299
off-topic it was almost like I don't

34
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,130
know what to do with this video we've

35
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,960
been experimenting yeah we've just been

36
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,210
experimenting you know yet inside the

37
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,460
mind of Ryan Higa yep that podcast was

38
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,070
basically inside the mind of Derek it

39
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,600
well it was but I also felt like he was

40
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,729
trying to channel someone else's mind

41
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,740
one day we might I might just post it

42
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:43,020
one day just because it'll be funny sure

43
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:46,170
but I feel like we should not be posed

44
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,450
in that kind of pocket yeah it's a long

45
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,240
format yeah no we're getting used to it

46
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:54,750
anyway we are figuring it out and this

47
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,610
is the first one it's not I already said

48
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,140
this is technically the first one on

49
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:02,520
this channel yeah but it's not the first

50
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,899
one how did I how did how do we we don't

51
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,460
even have an intro nope

52
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,220
anyway I think we should stick with the

53
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:13,150
clapping thing I mean we already did it

54
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:14,980
oh okay off to a good start

55
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,209
I guess you can just say I just want to

56
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,560
give that intro because this is the

57
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:21,519
first one so you want to intro the

58
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,080
guests so the guests I guess I don't

59
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:24,730
know if you guys are always gonna be

60
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,769
here we're still figuring out we got to

61
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:28,810
get I think we already have a bunch of

62
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:30,459
guests that we have coming up I don't

63
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,310
know if it's smart to say who it is yet

64
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:34,959
but um you guys already know Paco you

65
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:40,150
guys already know will and you guys

66
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:41,319
might know me yeah okay well and also

67
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,790
for people who don't know it's called

68
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,799
off the pill podcast if you don't know

69
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:47,310
that by now which is a little strange

70
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:49,569
while you're watching this it's because

71
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,640
that whole thing started when I started

72
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:53,799
ranting on videos without taking my meds

73
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,900
I have ADHD I don't take my meds

74
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:57,609
sometimes and when I do that I start

75
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,739
talking in circles and talking about

76
00:02:57,609 --> 00:03:01,000
random things and that's what this

77
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:02,769
podcast is all about you know just

78
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,010
having fun talking about random things

79
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:08,620
really is an important and important

80
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,989
issues unstructured no they're

81
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,190
structured bar faris structure what are

82
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:14,680
you talking about I mean there is

83
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,840
structure within unstructured we all

84
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,109
clapped boom every single time in the

85
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,549
beginning we always clap that structure

86
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:24,459
and we breathe in

87
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:25,930
that's our closer yeah we're not we're

88
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:27,760
still figuring this we have two things

89
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,290
basically that are structured everything

90
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,359
in the middle okay

91
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:33,639
well it's only our first one technically

92
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:35,260
fourth one because we're not posting the

93
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:36,700

96
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:44,459

98
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:49,000

but also really cool to some kids that

124
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,340
are outcasts

125
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:47,620

126
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:50,560
topics are us hot topics this that could

127
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:52,720
be you this is the essence of off the

128
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,330
pill podcast we tried to start something

129
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,170
I know and we absolutely failed and went

130
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,610
somewhere else with it

131
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,169
people don't know this to it people

132
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:02,200
don't know this too but we've actually

133
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:03,460
done more that that we never people

134
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,580
would never see because we were just

135
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:09,010
experimenting and they're just trash

136
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:11,080
kind of like this one back to Paco

137
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,220
while we talk a little bit about brand

138
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,590
deals cuz that seems to be something

139
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:17,260
that a lot of everyone has yeah yeah are

140
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,730
going into it I know except uh you've

141
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:22,060
kind of been someone that has steered

142
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:25,030
away from that type of content and my I

143
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,470
personally I'm very interested in that

144
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,090
you told we've talked a little bit about

145
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,880
it but I think a lot of the audience do

146
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:33,880
would be like how does Ryan make money

147
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:37,240
on YouTube since the ad pocalypse you

148
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,580
know I mean it's not as good and I

149
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,540
haven't I really don't do that many

150
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,000
sponsorship deals because I always base

151
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:45,610
the content around I mean you guys know

152
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,560
I've always based it around just if the

153
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:50,229
ad interferes with the funny or the

154
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,880
story then I'm not gonna do it I get I

155
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:53,500
get asked to do stuff like probably

156
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,450
every day like multiple inquiries

157
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,180
alright reflex but okay

158
00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:00,280
is that a flex it is that's what

159
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,780
continue continue continue I don't know

160
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,030

161
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,890
gonna go ADHD right now continue on the

162
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,830
band you're the one who threw me off I

163
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:10,240
didn't take my fault what are you

164
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,040
talking about you're talking about

165
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,490
brownie like some people ask you

166
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,560
everyday

167
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,770
oh okay yeah people send or that is a

168
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,660
flex it is it's not that weird though

169
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:22,919
it's normal for youtubers anyway as I

170
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:26,140
was saying before someone interrupted my

171
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:27,100
flight ever I was talking about yeah we

172
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,919
get that all the time

173
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:33,130
I get that sent in random enquiries and

174
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:36,520
most I would say like ninety-nine out of

175
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:38,900
a hundred are things that I don't really

176
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,840
care for don't really know or I

177
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:44,350
find a way to make it funny or it's just

178
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,820
a ridiculous off like it's like nothing

179
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:49,729
or they just want like sometimes it's

180
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:52,370
just like hey you mind making a video

181
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:53,720
for us we don't have any money but you

182
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,000
know this I think we think this you'll

183
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,979
like this product like well I mean if I

184
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,300
really liked it I would use it but that

185
00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:01,160
it felt like I said it comes down to

186
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,990
like can you make it interesting

187
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,460
mm-hmm that's how I choose sponsored it

188
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:08,330
this that's why there's almost none yeah

189
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:10,220
and yeah it would be nice to have some

190
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:13,130
it would be it would we could upgrade

191
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:14,510
our mics not if you sound horrible right

192
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,250
they're actually pretty good and rolled

193
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,960
shout the road this is not a sponsorship

194
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,789
but they did send this free free stuff

195
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,830
so that's why we have this set up yeah

196
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:23,930
so thank you very much Road yeah not a

197
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:26,840
sponsorship nope because it's still

198
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:29,030
waiting for you one thing too that I've

199
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,940
noticed like brands and will try to

200
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:32,330
reach out to you the process is very

201
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,310
slow

202
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:37,160
you know yeah and the way that Ryan

203
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:39,530
works is is within like a week

204
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,740
he thinks of idea we film it and edit it

205
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:44,690
and if if that holds back like the brand

206
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:47,630
or the deal holds it back in any way

207
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:50,270
it's very hard to commit to it you know

208
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:52,699
cuz it's like what is it it's time it's

209
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,080
a balance between like you know doing

210
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:56,389
our own thing and the time that is

211
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,860
involved right with working with them

212
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:59,990
and going through that process

213
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,460
it's a long process it's really long and

214
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,699
yeah I've also worked with other

215
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:07,699
youtubers as well and cool

216
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:10,130
well wasabi and when they were doing

217
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:12,710
brand deals and stuff a lot of times

218
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:14,870
yeah those brands would see a completed

219
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:17,090
project and they'd be like we don't like

220
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,669
this right we want something else that's

221
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:21,409
also a big thing that I always try and I

222
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:24,320
wouldn't say negotiate but that's like a

223
00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:25,849
must I always have to say like I want

224
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,500
the creative control and a lot of times

225
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:29,000
brands don't want to give you that yeah

226
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,770
cuz they want to make sure their brand

227
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,599
if they're paying for it they want to

228
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,709
make sure like it's all about them yeah

229
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:35,750
exactly

230
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:37,849
so that's why for me it's just every all

231
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:42,289
these things have to line up for me to

232
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:44,360
be able to do it but in a podcast way

233
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,980
easier form this way easier yeah just

234
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,440
talk about it but even with that I would

235
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,510
still want products that I actually like

236
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,590
I don't want to be like I don't want to

237
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:54,080
name any

238
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,910
I don't want to like talk about X

239
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,740
product and that product I don't even

240
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:00,560
like yeah you know like oh that's a

241
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,850
crappy thing cuz I like this other one

242
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,020
better but because they're paying me I'm

243
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,400
gonna talk like because it's like you're

244
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,500
signing off on it you're like it

245
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,089
sourcing it in a way exactly and you're

246
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,410
and then it people use it or buy it and

247
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:12,250
it's bad it's just like your opinion

248
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:14,779
means nothing yeah if it's a bad product

249
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:17,779
but you have the luxury of doing that as

250
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:20,960
well what do you mean where you're in a

251
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:23,089
comfortable space yeah it's yeah I mean

252
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:26,870
it so it would be it's comfortable

253
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:28,339
spaces that is a debatable at the answer

254
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:31,490
yeah yeah yeah who you're talking about

255
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:32,839
because I think overall you're in a lot

256
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,760
more of a comfortable spot than most

257
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:37,640
people of course yeah yeah than most

258
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:39,910
people so you're you have the ability to

259
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:42,350
make those decisions and not be like oh

260
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:48,279
I'll give up a little bit of my morals

261
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:50,630
or values to do this sponsorship yes

262
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:52,460
yeah I would say so

263
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:54,830
yeah but I mean I've done things that

264
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:58,730
I'm not proud of who she would go into

265
00:09:54,830 --> 00:10:01,339
that I'm not proud of maybe like what is

266
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:04,760
if you want to talk about what's the

267
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:07,640
most positive experiences with brands or

268
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,230
ones that you've kind of look back on

269
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,020
and said like that was good and you know

270
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:13,400
it's fun and I mean there's the thing is

271
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,110
it's tough because I don't know which

272
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,540
ones I've signed contracts with that I

273
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:19,430
can't talk about there's just a part of

274
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,960
that how about let's talk about the

275
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,500
positive in like which one did you enjoy

276
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,760
the most

277
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:27,050
I don't know there's a lot of them you

278
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,110
know what a good examples like the

279
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:31,700
fortnight video right I had the idea and

280
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,320
I went to them actually they didn't come

281
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,820
to me I was like hey I have this idea do

282
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,430
you have some kind of budget so I can

283
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:40,250
make this you know better yeah and I

284
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:42,200
went to Epic Games yeah yeah epic games

285
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:44,630
well I kind of met like a middle person

286
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,430
but we made that deal happen and that

287
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:48,950
was it's easier that way because I can

288
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:50,360
present them my idea rather than being

289
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,010
like hey you have to say our name this

290
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,750
many times you got to show this much

291
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,890
gameplay and like that's that's the kind

292
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:58,730
of stuff that's I could turn off to me

293
00:10:54,890 --> 00:11:00,410
right but I mean I I had yeah I've had

294
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,209
some bad experience it when I'm not bad

295
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,400
it's just like I've had ones in the past

296
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:06,290
when I started like

297
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,240
in high school yeah I did my first brand

298
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,620
deals I was just like holy crap they're

299
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,300
gonna pay me this much money just to

300
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,770
make a video and I just completely sold

301
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,440
out yeah yeah and people were pissed

302
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:18,080
back then people kids way different

303
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,720
hated ads you know like how I never

304
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,070
understood that you know how like back

305
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,870
then I don't know if they'd still have

306
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:25,910
hints but when like skateboarders you

307
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:27,620
liked got sponsored you big holy crap

308
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:29,540
he's legit like that's dope Congrats

309
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,340
that's awesome right back when YouTube

310
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,320
first was starting if you got a

311
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,540
sponsorship of any kind people were

312
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,220
pissed at you like I don't know if you

313
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:41,480
guys remember that time I was like mm

314
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:44,060
between 5 and I guess 9 and 10 right I

315
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,300
remember we all did this Carl's jr. deal

316
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:48,920
I remember the Mater made our own

317
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:51,290
mushroom basically what about portobello

318
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,900
mushroom burger yeah we did this ad

319
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:55,850
all of us did one in our own way and we

320
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,170
all had to post at the same time and I

321
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,850
thought it was funny I mean I was having

322
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,200
fun with it everybody seemed like they

323
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,630
were doing their own versions but people

324
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:05,000
were like pissed they were so mad

325
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:08,510
oh you guys are sellouts and all this

326
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,510
stuff I was like yeah okay it was a lot

327
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:13,250
of money but I think at the same time

328
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:15,380
it's because this is at the time there's

329
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,940
a new platform it was like wow these

330
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,380
guys have so much like creative control

331
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,660
and like they're doing what they want to

332
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:23,180
do that's great and then to see I guess

333
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:27,380
a corporate that's come in there it's

334
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:28,520
it's change its new to it yeah you're

335
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,920
just a little too close to Mike that

336
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,240
time Danny got scolded dude the first

337
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,790
scoring of the off the building was

338
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:43,790
gasps he's a loudest person most also

339
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:47,150
their closest I think that's even better

340
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:50,510
sounds more balanced we're talking about

341
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:52,190
a corporate yeah yeah I see that

342
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:55,940
perspective but now it's crazy how it's

343
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:57,950
changed like honestly I even felt back

344
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,780
then I felt like for me I didn't do that

345
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:02,150
many after that and I kind of learned

346
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,170
but like I wanted people if I was

347
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:06,310
working with a brand it had to be

348
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:09,110
somebody my followers would be like

349
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:10,910
happy about yeah holy crab you gots it

350
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:13,340
like like the Nintendo and I just did

351
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:14,630
like I actually love I've always loved

352
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,340
intends and most people do

353
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:17,750
I think they grew up like our age grew

354
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,550
up with Nintendo games and stuff

355
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,500
like that I feel like that's something I

356
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:24,410
felt okay this is just cool I've always

357
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,600
wanted to work with them same with like

358
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:29,270
I would work with I don't know just

359
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,240
things that people like or I guess our

360
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:34,070
age group I don't know if people are

361
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,960
still what I mean with phonetics over it

362
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:39,800
like how we were I think this is which

363
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:41,540
is popularity kind of like a lot of

364
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:46,220
people are gravitating towards that now

365
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:49,430
you're kind of far Joe Rogan says just

366
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:54,380
official Rogan did say that he always is

367
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:56,270
like swish that is one of the reasons

368
00:13:54,380 --> 00:14:02,630
why I like podcast I love Joe Rogan for

369
00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:04,730
sure I think like was this along like me

370
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:06,710
two three years ago yeah it's not a long

371
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:09,830
time but a couple years ago I wrote an

372
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:12,020
email to his thing to his like media

373
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:13,430
email really didn't get a response what

374
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,900
did you say I was just like I was

375
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:17,120
actually pitching to him for to do this

376
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,980
other idea this was like back when the

377
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,080
drama stuff was starting to happen yeah

378
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:23,830
this is before nobody really knows this

379
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:26,150
but I even I hit up Joe Rogan and

380
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:29,030
Julianne from Jenna and Julianne right

381
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:30,770
because I wanted to do a show that was

382
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:32,089
kind of based around fighting between

383
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:34,160
these people these drama channel because

384
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:35,960
I was so sick of all like the they were

385
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,150
all like district there was no fights at

386
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,530
the time yeah I was like damn imagine if

387
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:41,660
we had all these people having drama and

388
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:43,460
they just like really fought like we sit

389
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,950
up at UFC like Celebrity Deathmatch but

390
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:50,240
not death yeah you know and I had this

391
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:51,860
idea I sent a very basic version no not

392
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,750
a pitch I just kind of said oh I think

393
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,520
you'd be great for this I would love to

394
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,870
work with you I'm a fan of your podcast

395
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,890
like how you think like I think it's

396
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,830
brilliant

397
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:03,170
and I sent that over in the email a

398
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,700
couple years ago I don't know when

399
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:07,160
exactly it was just before there was

400
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:09,770
actual fights and right like I would say

401
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,660
it within half a year that first fight

402
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:14,270
was announced it was alright it's been

403
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,460
done great yeah the real question is did

404
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:19,460
Julian respond Julian did respond yeah

405
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:21,320
he thought it was a good idea because

406
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,839
Julian's all down he's down for he's

407
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,720
down for us to fight yeah I mean I said

408
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,459
one guy would never do jujitsu it I mean

409
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,640
I would do it but I wouldn't like he's

410
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:32,340
too big and

411
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,840
grab some sleeves with him what did that

412
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:38,940
mean yeah what is it it was just like a

413
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:40,500

UFC nobody has sleeves yeah well it was

420
00:15:54,990 --> 00:16:00,330
a jujitsu joke yeah I mean that's the

421
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,400
collar yeah trying to grab sleeves

422
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:04,650

423
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,970
well what are you grabbing then you grab

425
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:09,270
talking about the collar no no you can

426
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,340

00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:13,920
yeah of course yeah dude let's grab

428
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:15,450

cuz it's gonna happen

430
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:19,320
all right let's try it's like keep those

431
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,860
move let's grab sleeves let's leave that

432
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,810
alone

433
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,480
alone so that was brands you get another

434
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:26,400
topic sorry it's just an interesting

435
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,720
thing we don't have to like abruptly

436
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:31,580
stopped it stop it

437
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:33,570
you know what's another brand that I

438
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,040
don't know if I should say this as I

439
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:37,140
feeling it in trouble for it but I don't

440
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,440
care my podcast I can say whatever what

441
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:47,640
day you get them you know it upsets me a

442
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:49,410
little bit mines my ears grab someone's

443
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:56,310
sleeve I'm here and they are Swedish

444
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:59,820
guess who is it PewDiePie no as I was

445
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:02,340
fishing you into that it is IKEA so when

446
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,780
I was in LA I went to Ikea I mean

447
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:06,209
obvious everybody knows the hype right

448
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:09,270
early IKEA and I wasn't I think I'm one

449
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:14,130
of the very small majority the minority

450
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:16,050
not majority one of the minority I'm

451
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,900
part of a minority that is not a big fan

452
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:20,670
of IKEA what and I've never been meaning

453
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,800
I got all my stuff after the first time

454
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:24,600
I bought all my stuff for LA from Ikea

455
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,150
and had to build all of it the next like

456
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,340
two days after that I was like I'm never

457
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:31,590
going here again well that's if they

458
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:34,140
want to sponsor this part just kidding

459
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:36,810
nope because let me tell you why later

460
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:39,300
down the road not only was a lot of the

461
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:41,450
stuff you know Breaking and some of that

462
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,980
and that's probably my fault for how I'm

463
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,480
eating their product

464
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,460
are bad because they actually have great

465
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,230
a lot of this stuff in here well not all

466
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,429
of it actually not this stuff but

467
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:51,220
there's other in the other house yeah

468
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:53,660
it's a lot of IKEA products in there

469
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:56,480
even the bed that you took for me

470
00:17:53,660 --> 00:18:00,020
remember yeah there was a lot of IKEA

471
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,250
products and they work fine but um a lot

472
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,690
of them would break and I think it's

473
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:06,679
probably the way I built it yeah that's

474
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:09,919
exactly my point like I feel like IKEA

475
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:11,270
is a grocery store for furniture hmm and

476
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,190
like I just want to go to the restaurant

477
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:19,600
got it you know that's a great analogy

478
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:23,630
right yeah I thought of all people yeah

479
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,640
yeah I went in there and I instantly saw

480
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:28,490
the only things I really buy from Ikea

481
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,510
or things like this this is from this I

482
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,679
think this little thing in the

483
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:33,679
background you see how it's like metal

484
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:35,000
it's kind of like yeah this cabinet

485
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,130
looking thing yeah the cabinet like

486
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,660
anything like any other wood stuff or

487
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:40,400
like any of like that kind of stuff I

488
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,780
don't really buy coz it's just it's like

489
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,540
Ryan say it's like kind of falls apart

490
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:47,570
it's like kind of work too Dom has had

491
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:49,070
his for how many years well regardless

492
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:50,929
even if you build it right I'm sure a

493
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,640
lot of people do and it lasts for a long

494
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:56,140
time and maybe they just treat their

495
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,370
stuff better than I do but regardless I

496
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:00,980
just I just feel like if you're gonna

497
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:02,270
pay that much money you should they

498
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,770
should make it for you you shouldn't

499
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:05,750
like you don't go to a bakery and say

500
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:08,419
hey could I get some dough and some

501
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,559
sugar and and then oh I'm gonna have to

502
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:11,510
make this at home now it's been another

503
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:13,460
half a day no the reason why people go

504
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:15,890
to AI kids it's actually cheaper yeah

505
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:18,020
but how much cheaper like a significant

506
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:19,880
amount is it really it really is that's

507
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,860
where we differ is you don't like it

508
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,600
because you have to build it yeah I

509
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,520
don't like it is because it it's not

510
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,710
like I'd rather just spend more money

511
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:32,540
for something that's like higher call

512
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:35,210
like that a craftsman major yeah this

513
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:37,070
money making barrel I'm like cheap those

514
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:39,320
much money's I could save well no but I

515
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,730
like so Ione can compare this to another

516
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,880
store out here in Vegas it's like a

517
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:46,370
local place and they made products that

518
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,559
look just as good as IKEA stuff I think

519
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:52,220
it called Biggs something I don't know

520
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:53,809
yeah they made products just as good are

521
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,370
on the same price range I would say I

522
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:57,230
remember comparing at the time when I

523
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:58,670
was first getting furniture

524
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,980
they're very similar psyche if not

525
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:02,960
cheaper and those products are still

526
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:06,470
held together they're already made and

527
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,030
they do free delivery yeah I knew that I

528
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:09,650
don't know if it seems pretty big you

529
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:14,090
know what it is bigs yeah yeah yeah like

530
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:16,010
it's a big it's a big place big and it's

531
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:17,690
um good stuff man

532
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:19,190
yeah they deliver for free like people

533
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:21,260
come in to us put it where you want in

534
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,760
your house like what that that alone is

535
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:25,070
worth whatever more you got to pay to

536
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,110
Ikea to me and you save yourself a day a

537
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:29,300
day you could be working and making

538
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:31,100
money which is actually why you're

539
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,950
actually losing money by buying products

540

prove me wrong

543
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:42,650

544
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:46,270
does to compete with a store like thank

553
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:06,530

571
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:47,960

on my cringe level

581
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:17,180
- speaking I should probably get off the

582
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:21,200
topic of brands because what if burning

583
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:22,970
bridges just saying though I mean my

584
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,740
opinion could change I'm not gonna take

585
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:26,660
the deal unless it has changed then

586
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:31,910
interesting transition from hey we don't

587
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:35,060
have any brands to you know topic one

588
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:36,470
really did scare me and IKEA I honest I

589
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,190
still I'm not gonna lie right let's try

590
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:39,140
how I feel

591
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:42,530
let's try and salvage is do it so hot

592
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:44,480
topic did scare you at first but but I

593
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:47,180
go there but now they're great because

594
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,160
we go there for props we want to have

595
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:50,720
like a really like you know want to go

596
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:54,170
for that look and I also think they have

597
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:57,020
like some good like real nice things

598
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:59,810
like like they tap into certain I guess

599
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:01,970
cultures band that's sure or they have

600
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:05,000
like that like searching like weepings

601
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:06,650
cartoons yeah happened to that and if I

602
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,500
want to wear like some dumb Sailor Moon

603
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:10,880
shirt which I love

604
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,140
should we tell people the fun fact that

605
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,500
you like to wear skirts at home for

606
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,110

608
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:20,720
nothing wrong with that dude this is

609
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:25,310
2019 no it's not that it is I live with

610
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:27,320

611
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:28,850
mindset for that like I mean like I'm

612
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,500
not judging yeah it's the same with but

613
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:33,410

Crocs uh-huh I was like do nobody wears

guess in a way hipster yeah but it's

618
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:44,900
more like I wanna make people cringe do

619
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,040
you want me to tell the story about what

620
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,810
you're talkin can tell this story

621
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,200
because I think he's trying to defend

622
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,690
himself

623
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,820

625
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,540

room with no shirt on no socks but he's

632
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:14,720

to make me laugh he just walks by and

638
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:28,309
I'm looking at him like waiting for him

639
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:29,809
to kind of turn around or like maybe

640
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:32,630
he'd lift his skirt up to try and make

641
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:34,400
me laugh or like make a joke nothing he

642
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,990

646
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:44,330
stranger because you made a conscious

647
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:46,520
choice to like hey I'm gonna go out into

648
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:53,419
the into the world with no shirt on and

649
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:55,520
just a skirt which is I mean summertime

650
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:57,919
so it's like really hot and I never

651
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:01,070
lived in Vegas so I was like no shirt I

652
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:03,860
need that ventilation on my nips and if

653
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:05,570
I'm wearing pants you know I have a

654
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:07,610
skirt I can just open it up and there's

655
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:09,860
a breeze strumming we already know now

656
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:12,260
that that's you yeah but like this is

657
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:13,700
like when you first oh yeah yeah I came

658
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:17,450
into the group and we were just like

659
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:19,250
okay so this guy is different not I mean

660
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,960
it's not a bad thing it's interesting if

661
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:23,290
anything you know don't wear it anymore

662
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,270
no I have been worn in for a long time

663
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:28,630
see it's not genuine then you don't love

664
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,630
skirts

665
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:33,830
that's why it's like I just wore it just

666
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:36,140
to be like huh how we like react I think

667
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:37,370
you are discovering yourself that's the

668
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,530
kind of person I feel like you are oh

669
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,970
yeah always self-discovery everyday you

670
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:47,630
know did you like check it off a list

671
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:49,580
like skirts cross I will wear it once in

672
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:51,530
a while though for like streams or

673
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,540
something okay well that's just for

674
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:54,740
entertainment yeah it's funny the weird

675
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,990
thing about it was that you weren't

676
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:58,640
doing it for any like you just we

677
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:01,280
weren't filming you just did it it was

678
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,860
behind closed doors yeah that you walked

679
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,720
out of that closed door to me mm-hmm are

680
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:07,880
you a fan of Jaden Smith I feel like

681
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,320
that's something he did and like maybe

682
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,090
that it was around that time maybe

683
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,679
that's why it might have been but I know

684
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:14,720
you're inspired by those so the thing is

685
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:16,940
I had actually bought that two years

686
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,940
before mm-hmm

687
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:23,510
and then from that point it was kind of

688
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:25,780
just like hey this is a weird thing to

689
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:28,730
have so I'm just gonna use it sometimes

690
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:30,770
okay because like I mean otherwise it's

691
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:32,600
just sitting around yeah you can't let a

692
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:33,200
good skirt go to wait yeah you know

693
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,289
guess

694
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,970
if you got it flaunt it yeah watch us

695
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:41,389
get all these comments like oh my god

696
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:42,830
will and Ryan are so unaccepting I said

697
00:26:41,389 --> 00:26:48,590
you can wear whatever you want I know

698
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:51,350
but this is my this is my pocket I think

699
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:52,519
I think it's a little weird I mean I

700
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,480
have nothing against people who cross

701
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:55,250
dress that's fine

702
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,960
and who says it's cross-dressing what if

703
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:59,779
you were Irish is that stereotypical

704
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,909
though there's kilts kilts Scot Scottish

705
00:26:59,779 --> 00:27:03,080
Scottish not Irish when I first saw it

706
00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:05,480
that's what I thought it was I was like

707
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,889
no it's like but it is pink yeah but I

708
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,019

who he is

00:27:25,899 --> 00:27:34,610
close-minded clothes mind closed minded

719
00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:36,080
bang I don't know that made me think

720
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:39,799
about like I don't know why we started

721
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:43,940
talking about that hot topic oh that's

722
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:45,470
right his weird choices see even the

723
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:47,360
fact that I even have to quit like I

724
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:50,179
have to stop myself from saying that's a

725
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,679
weird choice that he made and think

726
00:27:50,179 --> 00:27:54,620
about like all the backlash

727
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,960
yeah like are people gonna it's such a

728
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:59,269
such a sad thing it was never like this

729
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,039
before we we talked about this all the

730
00:27:59,269 --> 00:28:06,500
time never ought not publicly but yeah

731
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:08,360
it's my think it's but it's not like

732
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,710
it's not coming from a place of hate no

733
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,899
not at all it's just coming from a place

734
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:14,450
of like oh this is different to me yeah

735
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:17,389
I'm the norm yeah like I mean I just I

736
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:18,919
mean like even like the whole yeah it's

737
00:28:17,389 --> 00:28:20,720
so frustrating to talk because I have to

738
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:22,220
be careful yeah yeah yeah there's all

739
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,019
these like there's so many rules

740
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:25,610
landline there's so many rules but like

741
00:28:24,019 --> 00:28:27,860
even like talking about like the like

742
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:30,080
saying like before it everything changes

743
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:31,820
saying like oh I support gay marriage or

744
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,850
saying like just saying that you're

745
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:35,750
gonna get hate either way yeah yeah so

746
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:37,669
you might as well just make both sides

747
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:41,389
hate you and say you don't and you do

748
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:45,200
accept that gay people hate them love

749
00:28:41,389 --> 00:28:45,750
them bring on the hate both sides I want

750
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,810
both

751
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:49,950
or you get love from both sides you know

752
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:52,590
are you going to be like I don't care

753
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:54,090
yeah you know whatever that is try it I

754
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:56,340
think the old sides will be like oh why

755
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:58,860
don't you care about our agenda I know

756
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:03,090
this is like every like podcast has like

757
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:05,700
PC talk yeah yeah but you know what I

758
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:07,140
actually never did a video on I never

759
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,820
actually really did a video about gay

760
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,140
people or like kind of like touched on

761
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:13,290
that one that was like the hot topic

762
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:15,300
yeah hot topic that was your brands

763
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:17,220
nobody you know I mean it was like I

764
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:19,680
mean it was more popular than it is now

765
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:22,200
like everything happens in trends like

766
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,030
for a while the whole game we're not

767
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,340
that it's done but the whole move the

768
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:28,650
gay movement and LGBT thing yeah was

769
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:31,230
solely focused around gay marriage I

770
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:32,820
forget you remember okay sure

771
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:36,750
and then now it's kind of like the

772
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:38,550
transgender thing you know but before it

773
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:40,200
was more just like you know about gay

774
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:43,620
marriage and you know gay people and

775
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,030
letting them be there and stuff yeah but

776
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:46,380
it's funny how things happen in trends

777
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:48,420
but when that was happening I just never

778
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,070
really touched the subject obviously had

779
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,120
we had gay friends I don't again I was

780
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:53,580
kind of in that boat of like I don't

781
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,050
care yeah do what you want to do what

782
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:57,000
makes you happy baby yeah do what you

783
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:58,680
want to do like I also and if you it's

784
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,240
your religion and you are against it to

785
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,590
me I'm just like okay then be against it

786
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,420
but I'll don't have to go in you and I

787
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:07,140
come from Hawaii which is a place of

788
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:09,720
like people are just openly super

789
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,400
flamboyant if they are gay oh yeah well

790
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,070
like they're called marries in a way

791
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,960
indeed life for her memories for us

792
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:18,570
yeah just heard a different M word oh

793
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,640
yeah oh that one as well but in Hawaii

794
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:21,510
they say ma hoo yeah but I don't know if

795
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,630
that's insulting

796
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:26,010
yeah I don't know either

797
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:28,290
honestly anymore I don't know

798
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:30,600
everything's changed man but you know

799
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:32,280
what I always thought the way I really

800
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:36,120
broke it down and tried to think about

801
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:38,850
it is like I can't like I really believe

802
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:41,370
that you can't choose to be gay so how

803
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:43,260
can you hate on someone exactly yeah for

804
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:46,590
something they can't control mmm you

805
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:48,780
know it's like hating on someone like

806
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:50,190
being Asian yeah but people would really

807
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,660
do believe that you can choose to be gay

808
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:53,790
yeah like a lot of people still believe

809
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:56,070
that less but I think a lot of people do

810
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:59,620
and it's a choice but the funny thing is

811
00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:02,320
I think the people who think like

812
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:04,870
that are actually the closest to

813
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,220
becoming gay or being gay or they are

814
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:07,809
gay and they're trying to fight it this

815
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:10,000
yeah like the only people who are like

816
00:31:07,809 --> 00:31:11,650
if you really think about it like I try

817
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,770
and think it think about it myself like

818
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:18,100
if it's a choice I can't really right

819
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:19,300
now think or I think I just can't be

820
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:21,610
attracted to both of you

821
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:23,260
I can't choose to want to be attracted

822
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:27,160
to you guys that hurt you know I mean

823
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:29,380
like I can't or any guy yeah I can't

824
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,940
choose if you really think it's possible

825
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:33,220
right now if I were to think like you

826
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:35,170
know what it's if if it was my choice if

827
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:36,400
I wanted to do that yeah I could be gay

828
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:38,950
and I could like you I could be

829
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:41,200
attracted to you then I'm probably gay

830
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:45,160
mehar by Turing but I don't think it's

831
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,720
possible to be to choose it like I just

832
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,250
really can't think it's possible I think

833
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,120
you think it's a choice then you're

834
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:54,370
probably questioning yourself yeah I

835
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,059
thought about it before like am i gay I

836
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,800
know

837
00:31:55,059 --> 00:31:59,200
and then I we thought you were yeah

838
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:01,059
actually a lot of people think I am it's

839
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,650
well the skirt thing and like you know

840
00:32:01,059 --> 00:32:04,630
there's a bunch of others yeah but and

841
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:08,830
I'm like very I can be very flamboyant

842
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:14,380
at times yes but then I was I was just

843
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:16,030
like hmm okay like I can see guys and be

844
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:18,970
like oh dude that's an attractive person

845
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:22,120
but I'm not I mean anything yeah exactly

846
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:23,830
and for me I don't know this is gonna

847
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,550
get taken out or inappropriate but when

848
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:26,320
I brush my teeth

849
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:28,929
not taking out anything dude and I scrub

850
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:31,360
the back of my tongue and I gag I'm like

851
00:32:28,929 --> 00:32:34,120
I don't like this feeling enough me and

852
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,770
we might have to take it out like hot

853
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:38,470
topic and I care never gonna appear this

854
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:39,910
video when they sponsor this well that's

855
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:41,950
what you're saying about like you don't

856
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:43,090
think it's a choice to be homosexual I

857
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:45,450
don't think it can be from the high

858
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:49,330
point of view imagine like growing up

859
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:52,360
because from our point of view as a

860
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:54,309
straight male yeah we we grew up and we

861
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,200
were born into this world and we like

862
00:32:54,309 --> 00:33:00,700
we're attracted to women right so

863
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:03,309
imagine being like born a man and just

864
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:06,040
being born attracted to men and having

865
00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:08,130
people say right you know it's got to be

866
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,970
pretty frustrating oh yeah definitely

867
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:12,730
looking at it from their point of view

868
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:15,220
is like so and if someone told you like

869
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:16,960
it's a choice for you to like women it's

870
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:20,830
like well let's just true I'm attracted

871
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:23,289
to it's so very easy but that's what I'm

872
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:24,999
saying the people who are even

873
00:33:23,289 --> 00:33:26,950
questioned like if they even think that

874
00:33:24,999 --> 00:33:28,600
it's a choice yeah it means they can't

875
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:30,909
they're probably thinking about it for

876
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,289
themselves sure cuz like or they're not

877
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:33,429
thinking they're just saying like but

878
00:33:32,289 --> 00:33:37,269
anyone who really thinks is a choice

879
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:39,129
just ask yourself this would you be able

880
00:33:37,269 --> 00:33:41,440
to choose to be attracted to a guy or

881
00:33:39,129 --> 00:33:43,600
girl yeah if you're a guy would you be

882
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,460
choose to be attracted to these same sex

883
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,779
because if you if you can then you

884
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,730
really shouldn't be art making that

885
00:33:46,779 --> 00:33:51,159
argument because you're probably gay

886
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:54,279
damn here's some freaking hot tea for

887
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:57,609
you what does that mean if imagine them

888
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:59,739
saying that that it's a choice because

889
00:33:57,609 --> 00:34:03,970
they are homosexual and they chose to

890
00:33:59,739 --> 00:34:05,649
like women boom Oh explosion you know

891
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:11,049
I'm saying so they're like it's a choice

892
00:34:05,649 --> 00:34:13,210
yeah yeah damn give me a high-five

893
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:18,429
yourself to him dude grabbing your own

894
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:20,589
sleeves that's pretty sweet how do we

895
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:23,020
get on this topic I need to go down the

896
00:34:20,589 --> 00:34:25,059
PC route oh you know what that's exactly

897
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:27,190
well we can't talk about current times

898
00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:29,950
and it's really upsetting I think you

899
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,549
know what I don't think it's bad to talk

900
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:32,589
about it

901
00:34:30,549 --> 00:34:34,629
no yeah and I think honestly the times

902
00:34:32,589 --> 00:34:36,460
are changing right now how you know

903
00:34:34,629 --> 00:34:38,079
everything has become very PC over the

904
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,849
past like five years I would say sure I

905
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,369
mean not just in the past five but

906
00:34:39,849 --> 00:34:44,169
really PC in the past five years old yes

907
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:48,280
yeah I think like I said everything

908
00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:50,710
happens in trends and this trend is was

909
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,059
is at its peak and it's gonna change and

910
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:54,780
go the opposite direction I think

911
00:34:52,059 --> 00:34:59,859
there's gonna be a big movement of

912
00:34:54,780 --> 00:35:01,240
anti-peace enos I think it's already

913
00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:03,069
starting to happen and I think it's

914
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,270
gonna become almost like damn you know

915
00:35:03,069 --> 00:35:06,130
we're gonna be like okay maybe we need a

916
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:07,809
little bit more yeah again so I think

917
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:10,390
it's gonna go and type in C and we're

918
00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:11,680
gonna be just a bunch of like racists

919
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:13,030
and meanies yeah but it's gonna be

920
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,799
acceptable and then it's gonna be

921
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:16,660
through the same thing I really believe

922
00:35:14,799 --> 00:35:18,490
that's how everything works well one

923
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:20,740
extreme pushes back the other extreme

924
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:22,180
exactly yeah then and it's always nice

925
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,320
to find the balance but there's never

926
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:26,590
gonna be balance

927
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:28,720
just like there's never peace there will

928
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:29,640
be balance if more people are balanced

929
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,320
boom

930
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:34,060
that is as not that's it okay that's

931
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,500
I'll work on it yeah yeah but that's

932
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,850
right that's what this kind of sucks

933
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:40,660
about the world is like it's it really

934
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:42,910
is kind of through the lens of the

935
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:44,140
extremes when I think moult like I I

936
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:47,050
would say the majority of people are

937
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:49,900
more more of like in the middle yeah but

938
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:53,040
it's that like that like loud minority

939
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:57,130
yeah you know which is kind of a shame

940
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:59,050
mm-hmm well I mean there goes our that's

941
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:01,900
and that's our PC section of the week

942
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:03,690
peace eNOS that's gonna be like our

943
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:06,250
little penis

944
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:11,650
for this episode of the penis of the

945
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:14,170
week we talk about gay you can't choose

946
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:19,330
to be gay if you believe that you're

947
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:21,160
probably gay all right we're gonna have

948
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:22,810
a piece eNOS of the week thing I might

949
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,520
bring it back see what people like you

950
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:26,530
know we're still experimenting I like it

951
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:28,300
um what else we got on the agenda today

952
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:30,850
I like it I don't think you meant to say

953
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:34,120
it but say what bearer menteng you know

954
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:36,520
like people who are curious about it

955
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:40,630
it's the about what you know like if

956
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:42,220
they're about the penises yeah yeah I

957
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:43,630
mean I mean like you know I didn't mean

958
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:45,610
to say that but okay

959
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:50,740
it's just naturally in you to experiment

960
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:52,960
is um she's she break I kind of do but

961
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:54,810
like so we were talking about having

962
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,160
this thing in our podcast where we do uh

963
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:59,860
you know rather than just doing the add

964
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:01,120
section what if we had what if we had

965
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:03,550
like this you know how normally they do

966
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:05,170
mid maybe rose-red a boat instead we do

967
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:06,850
I mean some people do like sponsorship

968
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:08,980
stuff but what if we created our own

969
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:14,260
commercials yeah see this could be you

970
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:16,000
hot topic or you IKEA Carl's jr. again

971
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,950
so we feel actually worked with in there

972
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,900
great no that's why again yeah film our

973
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:21,310
own commercial that we run during our

974
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,870
sheshe breaks I think we could make it

975
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:24,340
but we make it funny that would be

976
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:25,900
pretty cool I don't think you know

977
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:27,460
that's a lot of work too that's like

978
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,810
making a whole another video yeah I mean

979
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:31,510
Oh buddy I mean we could do it super

980
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:34,960
simple though yeah like like a 20 second

981
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:37,290
thing take a quick sheshe break yeah

982
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,900
people don't know from Hawaii we call

983
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:42,000
peeing shishi number one is shishi

984
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:44,640
number two is do do I guess that same

985
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,810
thing for everyone well I guess if we

986
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,750
take a doodoo break that's if there's a

987
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:51,480
long ad we do like a minute and a half

988
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:53,640
add one of those ones where the sidebar

989
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,160
comes up it's like skip ad dude - dude

990
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:58,620
that's what you can never take a do to

991
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,450
break at a that much taco no need to

992
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:02,430
Spence no we're bringing it up because

993
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:05,280
this is how paco avoids work when we're

994
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:08,520
filming and shoots Paco will go missing

995
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,510
for a clean 45 minutes and we already

996
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,090
know where he is he's in the bathroom

997
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:13,950
pooping yeah do doing I have a really

998
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:15,210
tight butthole I don't think that's the

999
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:17,550
reason I think it's just because you're

1000
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:21,270
on your phone that's okay so a new game

1001
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:24,090
came out what uh so supercell who has

1002
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:26,010
created yes clash royale classic line

1003
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:27,930
right right about with sprawl stars

1004
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:29,340
right like a MOBA game but I mean it

1005
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:31,110
just got released in America because

1006
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:33,360
apparently it's been played in other

1007
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:34,830
countries so what you're saying is the

1008
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:37,400
next time you go to the bathroom I'm

1009
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:41,190
definitely playing longer break yeah so

1010
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:42,990
you're just saying you're not working no

1011
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:44,340
I am well everyone else is like we're

1012
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:45,870
sweat we're try and get things done I'm

1013
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:47,760
writing because I'm thinking on you know

1014
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:49,110
second channel ideas oh yeah because

1015
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,550
you're playing girl stuff maybe we could

1016
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:51,840
get a brand deal with brawl stars and

1017
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:53,820
then they'll give me your phone is

1018
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:56,190
probably so filled of poop no cuz it's a

1019
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:57,930
brand new phone I bet you one sitting

1020
00:38:56,190 --> 00:39:01,980
food particles yeah there's so many poop

1021
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:03,600
articles but I do like having a shisha

1022
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,910
because I actually been drinking a lot

1023
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,470
of caffeine yeah should we do a quick

1024
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,220
shishi break and come back mini break

1025
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:12,870
two-minute break

1026
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:15,500
and oh wait not claps she break B and

1027
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:22,200
we're back to be off the bill podcast

1028
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:25,290
starring me me and me we didn't plan

1029
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:27,170
that it just happened and I hate it and

1030
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:31,590
I hate it so much

1031
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:33,300
anyway maybe it's a bad idea to do these

1032
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:34,440
she she breaks cuz like I forget what we

1033
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,420
were talking about well that's why you

1034
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,590
know what it's a refresher because I

1035
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,020
don't remember what we were talking

1036
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:41,910
about I show took my meds what if half

1037
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:44,730
the video is off the pill podcast and

1038
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:46,860
the other and happy and I'm just like

1039
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:48,750
really focused I think we should just

1040
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:49,970
like just start like guys actually have

1041
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:52,970
work to do

1042
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:57,260
just talking on your own honesty when I

1043
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:59,599
do take my my adderall yeah I man

1044
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:01,880
adderall such a bad name I guess like

1045
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:03,349
now it's like such a bad rap yep but I

1046
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,109
think people get affected from it

1047
00:40:03,349 --> 00:40:08,480
differently yeah yeah like for me when I

1048
00:40:06,109 --> 00:40:10,490
take it I don't get like height

1049
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,349
I'll some other people do mm-hm almost

1050
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:12,859
the opposite and I don't know if that's

1051
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:14,750
normal

1052
00:40:12,859 --> 00:40:16,040
but if I had it right now you guys could

1053
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:18,800
be talking and I could be working on

1054
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,510
something I could honestly work why you

1055
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,200
guys are talking isn't listening isn't

1056
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:22,819
that amazing

1057
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,160
it's amazing for me because I get

1058
00:40:22,819 --> 00:40:26,510
distracted super easily yeah not like in

1059
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,700
the stereotypical like Oh a butterfly

1060
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:30,680
you know yeah yeah but like even just

1061
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:32,300
talking right now I'm thinking of other

1062
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,170
things like what things I don't know

1063
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,300
just like you've been talking about

1064
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:36,800
words the word talking mm-hmm and then I

1065
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,569
started thinking about like and I say

1066
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,770
that we're talking a lot I was thinking

1067
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:42,800
about that while I was explaining to you

1068
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:44,270
the other thing damn that's weird it's

1069
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,890
not weird it's normal

1070
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:48,290
I think a lot of people do that they

1071
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:49,880
just don't let themselves explore that

1072
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:52,099
part yeah because even when I take my

1073
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:55,030
meds that happens but I can control it

1074
00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:57,050
that's the difference for me yeah and

1075
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:58,369
you know when I'm writing like scripts

1076
00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:01,069
and stuff like that it's actually easier

1077
00:40:58,369 --> 00:41:02,540
to not take it yeah and then after that

1078
00:41:01,069 --> 00:41:04,369
but when I'm not taking it basically

1079
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:07,550
what happens is I write all this

1080
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:09,710
nonsense like because the the reason why

1081
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:12,109
it turns out to be nonsense is because

1082
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:13,910
you're literally just going with the

1083
00:41:12,109 --> 00:41:15,829
flow and you can't stop because if you

1084
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:17,839
stop you're gonna forget the great idea

1085
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:19,760
you had and but the great idea sometimes

1086
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:21,530
leads to other ideas yeah that are

1087
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,880
completely unrelated but you have to

1088
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:24,230
write it down yeah

1089
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,060
because you never know when it's gonna

1090
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:28,220
come back yeah yeah and then you take

1091
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:30,380
your meds the next couple days later and

1092
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:32,390
you go and fix all the little things

1093
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:33,589
damn or put it together or put it put it

1094
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:36,020
in to make it make sense

1095
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:38,180
that's the secret right there that is

1096
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:40,369
the old not a secret do it if you have

1097
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:41,900
ADHD do that

1098
00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:43,280
I heard it's different for it I've

1099
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:45,170
talked to other people because they are

1100
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,510
mean even like like comments and people

1101
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:48,980
writing to me yeah saying like their

1102
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:51,859
experiences are similar some are very

1103
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:53,329
very different yeah I think it's not out

1104
00:41:51,859 --> 00:41:55,190
just like you have it or you don't think

1105
00:41:53,329 --> 00:41:57,609
I think it's a scale no yeah and I

1106
00:41:55,190 --> 00:42:00,260
really get upset when people say like oh

1107
00:41:57,609 --> 00:42:02,030
you're it's just like kids I mean a lot

1108
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,980
of it is that kids who just want to do

1109
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:05,590
drugs

1110
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:07,810
sure um but it's not fun to me like

1111
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:09,910
adderall is not a fun thing I don't get

1112
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:12,970
that same like hyperness and like yeah

1113
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:14,530
you know I mean it will keep you up but

1114
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:16,960
I don't get that like I don't get how

1115
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:19,359
that's fun yeah you know I don't know

1116
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:21,300
well that's probably because you or

1117
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:23,470
should be taking it to some extent

1118
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:28,480
rather than I don't take it all the time

1119
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:32,140
though yeah but yeah it's not fun to me

1120
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:35,609
at least No thank you way how do we get

1121
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:35,609
on that topic see I should took my meds

1122
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,100
we didn't even start with the topic know

1123
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:46,000
what's on the agenda

1124
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:47,170
yeah well for transitioning into

1125
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,080
different things

1126
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:52,210
speaking of transitions yeah uh we can

1127
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:54,670
just you know just talk about anything

1128
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:56,109
cuz we we had something trending so why

1129
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:58,240
don't we discuss something that you know

1130
00:42:56,109 --> 00:43:00,940
is bothering you guys recently in the

1131
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:04,119
past couple of days yeah let's get

1132
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:05,650
personal because I mean things that this

1133
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:08,500
is something that I learned in a writing

1134
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:11,020
class and what helps you write is name

1135
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:12,700
three things that you really like right

1136
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:15,100
now and three things that you don't like

1137
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:16,990
right now and then that's what they told

1138
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:18,280
you in the class yeah well because

1139
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:19,750
that's how you start writing with the

1140
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,560
topic right are you talking about fur

1141
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:22,990
stand up

1142
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:25,660
no just in general Oh in general like

1143
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:28,300
what worth writing stand-up or a joke or

1144
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:29,650
making a video or a story then you just

1145
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,630
like right through things so you could

1146
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:35,140
be like I like food I like getting

1147
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:37,869
massages and I like when people say

1148
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:40,510
thank you when I open the door something

1149
00:43:37,869 --> 00:43:43,300
I don't like static electricity I don't

1150
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:46,300
like when I pick my nose too hard and I

1151
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:49,869
bleed I love that one do you always

1152
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:51,910
bring that up I do though you always use

1153
00:43:49,869 --> 00:43:53,530
it as an example for something it's like

1154
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:55,330
we're playing like I dare you and you're

1155
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:56,650
like oh why don't we doing weird like

1156
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:59,080
you pick your nose who can like pick

1157
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:00,640
your nose until it bleeds no I brought

1158
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,230
this up many times this is not the first

1159
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,450
time this is like the third time any

1160
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:06,160
I've heard it from you before maybe or

1161
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:07,330
why either no it's - it's been at least

1162
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,859
a couple times we're like why do you

1163
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:10,210
always go to that I don't like why do

1164
00:44:08,859 --> 00:44:11,590
you want to see someone pick their nose

1165
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:12,510
who they bleed know is that your fetish

1166
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:16,020
No

1167
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:17,640
are you condemning my Kings I I just I'm

1168
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:19,650
curious is that your phone it's not as

1169
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,600
we can make that happen but you can pick

1170
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:23,640
our noses till it bleeds but basically

1171
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:25,440
from the six different topics there's

1172
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,880
usually like one or two that you really

1173
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,830
are like oh this is something that

1174
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,480
really annoys me or something I really

1175
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:33,030
like and then that's the one that you go

1176
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,980
off on already write about things I hate

1177
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:36,090
yeah so I mean I guess in the past

1178
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:38,430
couple of days what is something that

1179
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:39,540
you really like something has really

1180
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:41,400
been bothering you

1181
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:43,710
hmm something that's been really

1182
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:46,080
bothering you static electricity I don't

1183
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:48,180
know why but even know why it happened

1184
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:51,450
know every time I put my clothes in the

1185
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:53,609
dryer yeah cuz it's dry no but it's just

1186
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:55,590
like it's there's so much build-up it

1187
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:58,590
doesn't matter if I put like one of

1188
00:44:55,590 --> 00:45:00,300
those a dryer sheets the dryer sheets do

1189
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:01,800
your laundry oh you didn't know what

1190
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:03,090
that was called huh I thought was a

1191
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,340
detergent sheet or something like that

1192
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:07,710
was called yes I mean I never had to use

1193
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:09,330
that in Hawaii that's true yeah and so

1194
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:11,820
now out here like I have to use it

1195
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:13,410
inside used to using Hawaii well even at

1196
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:14,400
the old house the cloth like I never had

1197
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:18,150
to use it and my clothes weren't

1198
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:20,790
staticky uh and so it's so frustrating

1199
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:23,850
cuz that is if I have a staticky shirt

1200
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:27,420
if I put it on and I start driving then

1201
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:28,830
it makes my my seat all staticky hmm and

1202
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:30,750
then when I step out of the car gets

1203
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:33,000
shocked every time it's it's happening

1204
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:34,410
so much maybe you have powers wasn't

1205
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,720
there a guy called static shock he's a

1206
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:41,550
black dude why does that matter huh I

1207
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:45,020
thought you don't see clothes oh okay

1208
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:45,020
now I might have been a different day

1209
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:50,010
but yeah I maybe you just have like some

1210
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:51,720
kind of gift I don't know I don't think

1211
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:53,040
that's that's a curse maybe there's some

1212
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:55,380
way you can use it if you can channel

1213
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,660
static more than the average person what

1214
00:45:55,380 --> 00:46:01,140
is the thing about it like this what is

1215
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:02,369
the ultimate lame superpower that you

1216
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:04,680
can think of for yourself

1217
00:46:02,369 --> 00:46:05,940
that's like wow that's you know I mean

1218
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,560
like someone who can like remember that

1219
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:09,630
Family Guy episode where like make could

1220
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:11,700
grow her nail is really long that one's

1221
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:14,010
pretty lame yeah but like something like

1222
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:17,070
that like what would be your let's try

1223
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:18,390
think uh I don't know why I had this had

1224
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:20,220
this discussion with someone else before

1225
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:22,500
I was like if you had a realistic par

1226
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:24,030
with having to do with you but like not

1227
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,240
unreal I cursed rength or something like

1228
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:26,430
that

1229
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:29,640
okay a realistic lay empowerment

1230
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:31,410
yeah I don't know why for some reason

1231
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:34,200
for me is just like you could hold your

1232
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:36,900
breath for a really long time that's not

1233
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,549
lame that's a cool one that's I mean it

1234
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:40,980
is a little lame in that it's like well

1235
00:46:38,549 --> 00:46:42,660
would your name be you could swim like

1236
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:44,190
you're going to water for longer than

1237
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:46,920
anyone in the world what are you gonna

1238
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:47,940
do with it hide in the water that's true

1239
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:51,119
so what it's like

1240
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:52,619
oh no they're robbing a bank mister hold

1241
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,380
your breath forever man come save us

1242
00:46:52,619 --> 00:46:57,990
yeah but if they were like we designed

1243
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:59,789
these walking in the water boots and you

1244
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:04,170
could walk under the water and sneak up

1245
00:46:59,789 --> 00:47:05,670
on people boom you're a spy that's where

1246
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:08,609

1274
00:48:16,799 --> 00:48:22,859
about you um man I so I had a forget who

1275
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:24,839
was talking about with this but I had

1276
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:26,579
some good ones by the way that use it it

1277
00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:27,930
might have been David but but our

1278
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:29,760
premise was a little different it was

1279
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:32,430
like how can you have a really lame

1280
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,470
power but make it useful but it's also

1281
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:35,140
like like it has to be like that bounds

1282
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:37,270
of

1283
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:38,470
yeah only reason why I brought it up I

1284
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:40,480
was like it'd be really interesting to

1285
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:42,130
see that's what it was we're trying

1286
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,720
thing about tweet cuz I want to see what

1287
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:44,770
other people I never did it I don't see

1288
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:48,160
what other people would come up with

1289
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:50,350
because there's so many but I forget how

1290
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:52,090
to list somewhere of a bunch of them but

1291
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:53,800
it sounds like a fun drinking game where

1292
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:56,170
everyone has to like within 10 seconds

1293
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:57,850
come up with like a lame superpower yeah

1294
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:59,080
and then everyone is kind of like no

1295
00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:00,460
butchers it would be cool because you

1296
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:03,250
could do all this this is this and then

1297
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:05,440
right the end whoever has like the best

1298
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:07,090
lame superpower has to like drink or

1299
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:10,060
something I got another lame one what

1300
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:14,410
you could get out you can instantly get

1301
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:17,710
over a cold in 10 minutes so that power

1302
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:19,630
is like like it's good but it's for a

1303
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:23,020
superhero yeah it's pretty lame really

1304
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:27,910
lame what if what if your power was to

1305
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:30,130
just give someone a 10-second cold like

1306
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:31,780
you just feel like sick for 10 seconds

1307
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:34,420
that's it yeah they keep going the other

1308
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:36,550
thing is like the the strength of the

1309
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:38,260
cold is randomized from one to 10 yeah

1310
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:42,730
sometimes it could be like flu for 10

1311
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:44,740
it's not that could be that bird no oh

1312
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:47,680
my god keto flu going through it right

1313
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:49,300
now it's actually not as bad today as it

1314
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:51,100
was the last couple of days yeah it

1315
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:52,720
started about couple days ago so why are

1316
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:56,710
you going back into this though Kido

1317
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:58,510
yeah oh because it's um so yeah I mean

1318
00:49:56,710 --> 00:50:00,040
it's a nice diet I like to dye it every

1319
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:01,060
now and then remember this I mean

1320
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:06,070
there's the things I like having fun

1321
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:08,740
doing good I I mean I I eat a lot and I

1322
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:11,800
binge eat it's bad habits for all your

1323
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:15,970
wrestlers out there peak you're gonna

1324
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:17,650
you're gonna get really fat or you have

1325
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:19,060
to learn how to control yourself because

1326
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:20,770
that's where I picked up all my eating

1327
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:22,060
habits I learned binge eating I learned

1328
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:22,810
how to lose weight really quickly it's

1329
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,610
so unhealthy

1330
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:25,870
I've been told that but as a kid in high

1331
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:28,180
school I did not care because I just

1332
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:30,160
wanted to win play worse I guess

1333
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:34,690
fighters to stay champion in wrestling

1334
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:37,180
yeah in judo I got second um but I had a

1335
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:40,570
dislocated elbow while you were fighting

1336
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:44,710
in my first match I had a bye because I

1337
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:47,470
was fourth seed and then I dislocated my

1338
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:48,970
elbow they popped it back in or they did

1339
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:50,470
something I don't know if they popped it

1340
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:52,480
like wrapped it up it could barely use

1341
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:53,680
it the next match I had the it was

1342
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,810
semifinals ready because I had to buy

1343
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:59,440
and I had to face this guy who was

1344
00:50:55,810 --> 00:51:00,940
actually the number one seed and he was

1345
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,310
beating me the whole way I ended up

1346
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:04,690
countering him and then pinning him on

1347
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:06,910
the ground because he wasn't a wrestler

1348
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:08,950
hmm but he was like the favorite of the

1349
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:10,800
whole so it was a big upset yeah and

1350
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:13,619
nobody knew that I was like messed up

1351
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:15,970
and then I went to the finals match and

1352
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:17,500
basically at that point after the last

1353
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:19,330
guy it was like because it's all in one

1354
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:20,830
day right so the first injury happened

1355
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:23,230
in the in the morning and then after

1356
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:24,790
noon my arm is like I'm going to that

1357
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:27,250
next one I got kind of lucky being the

1358
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:30,910
the best guy pretty much using one arm

1359
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:32,740
and the last guy who's even like the

1360
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:33,940
guys before me were like oh man do not

1361
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:35,530
lose to this guy we've all beat him

1362
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:37,810
because there are there are 'allahu kids

1363
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:39,490
on the Big Island they were all like

1364
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:41,740
dude do not lose to this kid because

1365
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:42,970
we've all beat like he shouldn't be

1366
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:44,980
there essentially what they were saying

1367
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:46,359
but I mean he earned I mean he got there

1368
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:49,420
yeah you know he wasn't even seated in

1369
00:51:46,359 --> 00:51:51,010
the top four out of like the 30 I don't

1370
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:55,300
know how many people with 16 whatever it

1371
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:56,619
is yeah anyway once I laid him I was

1372
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:59,170
just like my arm was done like I

1373
00:51:56,619 --> 00:52:02,770
couldn't even like I could grab but it

1374
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:05,380
was like the strength of like me no no

1375
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:06,849
it was feeling like a child like a

1376
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:08,349
strength of a child so I basically had a

1377
00:52:06,849 --> 00:52:11,890
longer there so where it got worse and

1378
00:52:08,349 --> 00:52:14,260
worse and I didn't know that yeah yeah

1379
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:15,400
so I saw was really like upset because I

1380
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:17,710
don't mind losing to someone who's

1381
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:20,290
better I've always said this even like

1382
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:22,540
if it's like you know if I'm watching

1383
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:24,310
basketball or any sport I don't mind

1384
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:26,530
when my team loses to like okay that

1385
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:27,240
team would just deserve or when we play

1386
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:30,670
basketball

1387
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:31,869
we play every Wednesday and Friday if we

1388
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:33,520
lose to a team that's better than us and

1389
00:52:31,869 --> 00:52:35,260
we get blown out I'm like cool with that

1390
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,270
but if we lose to a team by like one

1391
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:39,160
point that we should have beat I'm like

1392
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:40,570
really upset because it's like I don't

1393
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:42,010
know why I just get really upset by that

1394
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:44,170
this is how you know it Ryan as

1395
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:45,910
frustrated went after the game usually

1396
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:48,880
like he'll spend maybe two to three

1397
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:51,040
minutes with the guys just talk and

1398
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:53,140
actually let's tip spend a lot more time

1399
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,910
to adapt people up oh yeah if we did

1400
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:56,589
really well he'll like hang out for like

1401
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:58,570
maybe five minutes but if he's upset

1402
00:52:56,589 --> 00:53:00,400
he'll grab his bags

1403
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:02,680
alright hey guys peace peace yeah shake

1404
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,450
everyone's hand just bounce but that's

1405
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,490
only if we lose to a good team I don't

1406
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:07,510
it doesn't yeah we deserve like it

1407
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:09,430
doesn't think we could have done yeah

1408
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:11,020
but in the same way in that in that

1409
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:12,970
tournament I was I was very

1410
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:14,290
disappointing because I knew I was like

1411
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:16,300
that was my senior year I was like what

1412
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:17,890
could have been you know and I cut all

1413
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:21,280
this weight people don't realize how

1414
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:22,600
hard that is to do in high school not

1415
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,590
just in high school but I mean like well

1416
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,300
you know there's so many other things

1417
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:27,400
you got to worry about and you're like

1418
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:28,570
always hungry and you're always grouchy

1419
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:32,320
yeah

1420
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:34,480
and thirsty even so yeah that was a very

1421
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:35,860
disappointing thing when you know I'm

1422
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,960
not that I sit I'm gonna say I would

1423
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:40,720
have won but like it you know you didn't

1424
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:42,520
give it your all pretty much so we I

1425
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:44,410
would say you probably did but it's just

1426
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:47,680
things that were out of your control

1427
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:49,270
right stopped you which is I mean I'm

1428
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:51,670
sure everyone can relate to that it's

1429
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:53,650
like super frustrating yeah I still

1430
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:56,140
think you're number one thanks man

1431
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:58,030
yeah but you're number two I am you know

1432
00:53:56,140 --> 00:54:00,340
I'm actually numbered out of the number

1433
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:01,420
two in doubles or tennis doubles so

1434
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:06,180
you're actually number four cuz your

1435
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:08,710
other friend was also part of that okay

1436
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:10,990
yeah I didn't know that you were

1437
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:12,340
actually athletic until I saw you like

1438
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:13,000
play basketball and you didn't know how

1439
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:14,200
to play basketball

1440
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,760
yeah and you actually could play

1441
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:19,470
basketball I said basketball like four

1442
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:24,490
times okay talking talk now uh so yeah a

1443
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:26,140
very similar situation where my partner

1444
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:29,260
is way better than me I only started

1445
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:30,670
playing tennis in uh in high school

1446
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:33,430
where a lot of people have been playing

1447
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:35,920
it for like their whole lives and then

1448
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:40,060
my senior year my partner and I got

1449
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:42,580
fourth seed and we were playing in the

1450
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:44,530
semi-finals against the first seed and

1451
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:46,000
we beat them and it was just like it was

1452
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:52,780
a huge upset because these guys would

1453
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:54,610
want like this song so because we had

1454
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:56,170
beaten them everyone is like tripping

1455
00:54:54,610 --> 00:54:58,330
out of their eyes just like oh my gosh

1456
00:54:56,170 --> 00:55:00,850
and like we're a public school too so to

1457
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:02,980
beat a private Punahou oh yeah it was a

1458
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:04,570
explains the people who don't know

1459
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:06,100
that's where Obama went yeah that's

1460
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:07,690
wrong but if you're from Hawaii sorry

1461
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:09,340
for all the Punahou kids I think they

1462
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:10,780
know this too yeah like everyone they're

1463
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,660
like the best at everything yeah cuz

1464
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:13,579
they have like

1465
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:15,559
they have like the most pretty girls too

1466
00:55:13,579 --> 00:55:17,299
I don't know about that but they have

1467
00:55:15,559 --> 00:55:19,039
like the most prestigious cues like the

1468
00:55:17,299 --> 00:55:20,510
smartest kids and like all the most

1469
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:21,980
established it's like the top of the

1470
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:24,770
that's like let's take the Harvard of

1471
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:26,150
Hawaii yeah the place everybody you know

1472
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:28,849
if you're not in there you're against

1473
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:30,859
them yeah it's so it's a big deal he's

1474
00:55:28,849 --> 00:55:33,289
there the Patriot exactly they're the

1475
00:55:30,859 --> 00:55:36,740
warrior they're the yeah the Warriors

1476
00:55:33,289 --> 00:55:39,530
so when any other school in Hawaii beats

1477
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:41,390
a Punahou kid usually it's it's pretty

1478
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:43,430
like you're like rooting for them yeah

1479
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:45,289
non Punahou person sorry for all the

1480
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:46,579
underdog from Point yeah but but it's

1481
00:55:45,289 --> 00:55:48,589
true I mean that's it comes with the

1482
00:55:46,579 --> 00:55:50,359
territory being number one you I mean

1483
00:55:48,589 --> 00:55:54,109
people always root for the underdog you

1484
00:55:50,359 --> 00:55:56,119
know and so we had beat their number one

1485
00:55:54,109 --> 00:56:00,200
seed the number one seed and I was

sleep I snuck out and hung out with her

1501
00:56:37,579 --> 00:56:43,039
but so like early in the morning and

1502
00:56:40,579 --> 00:56:47,359
then went to my match and I was

1503
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:47,960
exhausted and we we lost in straight

1504
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:51,170
sets

1505
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:53,000
in the finals and I I was tired I do I

1506
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:58,130
was tired and then if I was your

1507
00:56:53,000 --> 00:57:00,589
teammate but whoever that guy is you

1508
00:56:58,130 --> 00:57:01,849
need to apologize if that's once I don't

1509
00:57:00,589 --> 00:57:03,619
tell a lot of people it doesn't it

1510
00:57:01,849 --> 00:57:05,930
doesn't it's like who cares it's just

1511
00:57:03,619 --> 00:57:06,319
states like it's just like a sport who

1512
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:08,270
cares

1513
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:09,859
it's a big deal of dude like you'll

1514
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:11,690
never get that chance again

1515
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:13,400
yeah the same with like college players

1516
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:14,420
like that's why I like a lot of times it

1517
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,920
means more for them to win a

1518
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:19,039
championship in college and doesn't an

1519
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:21,109
NBA in basketball because you'll never

1520
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:24,109
get to do it again yeah you only get us

1521
00:57:21,109 --> 00:57:24,930
X amount of chances for chances to be

1522
00:57:24,109 --> 00:57:26,849
protected

1523
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:28,020
four chances and that's assuming you're

1524
00:57:26,849 --> 00:57:29,760
at your best when your freshman

1525
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:32,400
sophomore junior usually your senior

1526
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:34,190
year Dan that I feel bad for that guy

1527
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:38,160
it's big deal I mean you ever know two

1528
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:40,800
events like that can lead to scholarship

1529
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:43,260
three things that happen in your life

1530
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:52,260
you know and you took it away from your

1531
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:53,940
teammates I mean should we have to have

1532
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:57,030
to blanket I don't think so

1533
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:58,650
he's actually a very dude ever since at

1534
00:57:57,030 --> 00:58:00,930
a young age he's two years younger than

1535
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:02,640
me but I was always just like how did

1536
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:03,930
you go to know he's three years younger

1537
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:06,089
if he's a freshman what school did you

1538
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:07,589
go to I think um I went to Pearl City

1539
00:58:06,089 --> 00:58:10,380
High School parousia

1540
00:58:07,589 --> 00:58:11,819
yeah and I was he held himself with such

1541
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:13,440
poise and it's definitely because of his

1542
00:58:11,819 --> 00:58:15,329
parents and you could see and I was just

1543
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,470

were doing like really weird stuff like

1578
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:53,060

1579
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:54,320
like a t-shirt or crew shirt and they

1580
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:55,130

1581
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:59,030
look really cool

1582
00:59:55,130 --> 01:00:01,220
we had like full costumes and like skits

1583
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:03,200
and I did like a play we did like a play

1584
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:05,050
where we were dancing we were not good

1585
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:07,580
at dancing so we had to like to think of

1586
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:09,260
we're good at like making people laugh

1587
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:11,630
and making moments you know in

1588
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:13,430
storytelling you guys a good concept we

1589
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:15,109
did and no one really did that bad and

1590
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:16,700
like no one was really into that like

1591
01:00:15,109 --> 01:00:19,220
the dance competitions were all about

1592
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:21,320
the dance just dancing yeah so we would

1593
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:24,109
have like these big wooden sets that we

1594
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:26,660
would have to like lug on and like weird

1595
01:00:24,109 --> 01:00:29,150
like props everywhere and we almost won

1596
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:31,880
by we almost beat them by like point

1597
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:35,270

01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:38,030
close yeah I remember seeing that he's

1599
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:39,950
outline I'm sure it is yeah well step

1600
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:41,840
boys yeah the homeless one or no it was

1601
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:42,800
yes I think we call it the bump the bump

1602
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:46,160
show yeah

1603
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:49,609
and that the story of the show was I was

1604
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:51,920
a businessman and I lost my job and then

1605
01:00:49,609 --> 01:00:53,680
became like homeless and then there the

1606
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:56,480
story was there was a group of homeless

1607
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:59,750
people that like took me in and showed

1608
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:02,170
me the ways of of their world you know

1609
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:06,680
and then that that's I think this is

1610
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:08,869
this the ending of it was to be like

1611
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:10,550
accepting because then the person who

1612
01:01:08,869 --> 01:01:12,950
had delivered me the message lost their

1613
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:14,450
job and then I was like bringing him in

1614
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:18,200
at the end so it's kind of like this

1615
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:19,940
store narrative right yeah yeah and so

1616
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:22,460
people were and we had like really cool

1617
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:25,160
stunts yes that was like and then people

1618
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:30,350
were in a way you guys kind of pioneered

1619
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:32,900
that concept of like storytelling maybe

1620
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:34,640
like like mostly in our area I don't

1621
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:36,380
really know elsewhere no yeah but it

1622
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:40,550
like in the within the dance community

1623
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:42,290
is kind of like a small thing so work

1624
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:43,850
can spread fast sure and then there also

1625
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:46,010
have been like prestigious crews who

1626
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:48,260
have been like yo your idea like we

1627
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:48,839
flipped it a little bit they told you

1628
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:52,140
that yeah

1629
01:01:48,839 --> 01:01:53,430
yeah and you know I don't want to say

1630
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:55,079
like any names but there's been like

1631
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:56,819
bigger crews that have bigger shows I

1632
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:59,789
have said like they yeah we've allowed

1633
01:01:56,819 --> 01:02:05,700
them yeah some of our stuff say their

1634
01:01:59,789 --> 01:02:07,289
names can't no but that was our second

1635
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:08,700
place story my second place story it was

1636
01:02:07,289 --> 01:02:11,579
really cool God you know what that means

1637
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:13,890
we're all a bunch of losers yeah losers

1638
01:02:11,579 --> 01:02:15,779
yeah we make it we make it there and

1639
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:17,339
then we just do we don't finish yeah you

1640
01:02:15,779 --> 01:02:20,759
don't count you had first in wrestling

1641
01:02:17,339 --> 01:02:23,219
yeah but not in everything like I said

1642
01:02:20,759 --> 01:02:25,710
we almost make it to the perfect level

1643
01:02:23,219 --> 01:02:28,920
of championship but we just don't quite

1644
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:30,749
make it so that what that whole story we

1645
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:33,420
talked about was all because Paco said

1646
01:02:30,749 --> 01:02:38,969
think of something that you have

1647
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:41,299
problems with you guys gotta stop me

1648
01:02:38,969 --> 01:02:42,930
because I don't even remember like

1649
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:43,859
mid-sentence I'll forget what I'm

1650
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:45,359
talking about and I'm moving on to

1651
01:02:43,859 --> 01:02:47,849
something else and doesn't matter

1652
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:52,140
ya know that's what this podcast is I

1653
01:02:47,849 --> 01:02:53,609
know but at some point if I keep going

1654
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:55,049
really off that's what you guys are here

1655
01:02:53,609 --> 01:02:57,269
for someone's guy catch me and be like

1656
01:02:55,049 --> 01:02:58,769
hey we're not talking about that no yeah

1657
01:02:57,269 --> 01:03:00,660
but the thing is like what you're

1658
01:02:58,769 --> 01:03:02,369
talking about there's good substance to

1659
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:04,289
it it's a good story there's no reason

1660
01:03:02,369 --> 01:03:06,420
to cut it off sure yeah now if you're

1661
01:03:04,289 --> 01:03:08,549
just going off on something just then we

1662
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:10,710
do that right yeah that's that's why

1663
01:03:08,549 --> 01:03:12,979
this it's good so but I also don't

1664
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:15,599
realize don't worry

1665
01:03:12,979 --> 01:03:16,739
yeah I'll bring it full full circle but

1666
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:19,349
yeah I agree it's always retaining

1667
01:03:16,739 --> 01:03:22,499
that's entertaining that's that's why

1668
01:03:19,349 --> 01:03:26,190
I'm I've always had well not not always

1669
01:03:22,499 --> 01:03:27,359
but whenever we go on dates mm-hmm oh it

1670
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:33,329
would be a real issue

1671
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:34,680
why ill you go on dates now no I like

1672
01:03:33,329 --> 01:03:38,549
back in the day if you go on and deal

1673
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:41,430
with a girl yeah or guy I guess the

1674
01:03:38,549 --> 01:03:43,769
talking part I would have to always be

1675
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:45,150
conscious about like like I don't I

1676
01:03:43,769 --> 01:03:47,160
don't mind like talking to someone and

1677
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:48,930
we'll have a conversation but I have to

1678
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:49,979
like it almost makes me more awkward

1679
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:52,920
because I have to consciously be

1680
01:03:49,979 --> 01:03:54,839
thinking okay don't stay on topic

1681
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:56,489
like don't take any meds back then yeah

1682
01:03:54,839 --> 01:03:58,019
yeah you know when I was like yeah like

1683
01:03:56,489 --> 01:03:59,510
especially like right out of like

1684
01:03:58,019 --> 01:04:03,590
college and

1685
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:05,030
that time I was very awkward because I

1686
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:06,680
think I would be consciously trying to

1687
01:04:05,030 --> 01:04:07,910
think like stay on top and yeah listen

1688
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:09,860
to what she's saying or sometimes I'm

1689
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:11,450
not even there's not like a disrespect

1690
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:13,820
thing or like I it happens to people I

1691
01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:17,480
respect the most I've told people this

1692
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:20,420
before but like it's almost like the the

1693
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:22,190
one time I knew that I had I knew when I

1694
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:22,580
was a kid but like I knew something was

1695
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:24,890
weird

1696
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:27,620
yes I would have like you know like my

1697
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:29,000
um I grew up playing basketball and judo

1698
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:31,070
and they would call you in for Huddle's

1699
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,750
right and they would explain the play

1700
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:34,100
let's say basketball they would explain

1701
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:36,260
to our coach would explain the play and

1702
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:38,690
be like I would always get yelled at

1703
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:41,060
because I would never know what the play

1704
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:43,250
was about after we broke the huddle so

1705
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:45,830
like as I got older this is from ages

1706
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:46,940
five to 13 I would keep consciously

1707
01:04:45,830 --> 01:04:49,340
trying to tell myself okay pay attention

1708
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:51,740
right pay attention and then I don't

1709
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:53,360
know where break I was like oh my gosh

1710
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:55,940
trying so hard to pay attention that I

1711
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:57,560
didn't hear anything and I would always

1712
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:58,840
get yelled at but I really want I didn't

1713
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:02,000
want to get yeah I don't have to run

1714
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:03,200
suicides or sprints and I would always

1715
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,020
have to cuz I never knew what the hell

1716
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:07,880
was going on so like that's how I knew

1717
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:08,630
like okay me how do you like oh I would

1718
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:10,880
always wonder like how do people

1719
01:05:08,630 --> 01:05:12,530
remember this stuff it's not that I

1720
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:14,360
couldn't remember the time at the time I

1721
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:15,650
thought it was a memory thing yeah but

1722
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:19,070
it was like I just can't be attention

1723
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:21,080
yeah yeah it is and and it is I didn't

1724
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:25,040
realize until I took meds for the first

1725
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:27,050
time later in life which is in college

1726
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:28,760
and it was actually my prescription it's

1727
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:30,470
not one of those like underground like

1728
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:32,510
buy because everybody was trying to get

1729
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:35,060
adderall back in like in college yeah

1730
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:36,590
it's like a popular thing now mm-hmm but

1731
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:37,790
I didn't think it was it wasn't even

1732
01:05:36,590 --> 01:05:39,410
called adderal back then it was

1733
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:41,060
something else Ritalin riddle I don't

1734
01:05:39,410 --> 01:05:44,240
know if it was well they might have to

1735
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:45,920
be ritalin and then I think they I don't

1736
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:47,000
I think it's people still use really I

1737
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:49,790
think it's for different things maybe I

1738
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,140
don't know right but well regardless I

1739
01:05:49,790 --> 01:05:51,560
think I told this story did I tell this

1740
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:53,330
already

1741
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:58,190
I don't think so on the first two hot

1742
01:05:53,330 --> 01:06:00,110
gas in the consiguió anyway yeah that's

1743
01:05:58,190 --> 01:06:02,000
hot that's for people out there if

1744
01:06:00,110 --> 01:06:04,400
you're curious if you had kind of have

1745
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,690
ADHD that's what it's like cuz I there's

1746
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:07,490
no way I would have known if I didn't

1747
01:06:05,690 --> 01:06:09,440
take medicine ah this is what other

1748
01:06:07,490 --> 01:06:10,880
people get to experience naturally yeah

1749
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,110
I'm guys can read a book and it's not a

1750
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,150
big deal yeah

1751
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:17,120
I remember they would do those tests in

1752
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:19,280
school where they would test your

1753
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:21,110
comprehension and like your if you could

1754
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,940
read something and then kind of tell it

1755
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:24,980
back to them did they ever do that to

1756
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:27,200
you like in school like with the first

1757
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:30,470
time I got tested it was when I was in

1758
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:32,480
preschool and they thought uh they said

1759
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:35,150
they did say I had ADHD but my mom

1760
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,170
refused to put me on meds right probably

1761
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:39,230
would have been school would have been

1762
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:41,120
so much easier yeah but I mean I still

1763
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:46,190
got good grades growing up yeah it's a

1764
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:48,080
weird flex huh I did get good grades but

1765
01:06:46,190 --> 01:06:52,850
I kind of cheated a lot weird flex but

1766
01:06:48,080 --> 01:07:02,420
certainly that's an odd contraction of

1767
01:06:52,850 --> 01:07:06,320
muscles but was that the right time to

1768
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:07,370
use it though tries to keep me up to

1769
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:10,070
date with the little kids

1770
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:12,410
just a little cuz sometimes well I

1771
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:14,360
always use it wrong yeah but the thing

1772
01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:17,480
is also I think there's moments where

1773
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:19,100
you do it on purpose like I exactly know

1774
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:20,540
that was right that one was correct yeah

1775
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:22,550
but there's a lot of times you

1776
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:25,130
ironically oh yeah sometimes right yeah

1777
01:07:22,550 --> 01:07:25,690
as like a joke on the music what was I

1778
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:28,340
talking about

1779
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:31,280
weird flex but okay but what was the

1780
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:35,000
flexing about how you got grades even

1781
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:36,890
though you oh oh yeah I got diagnosed

1782
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,290
when I was today yeah okay the only one

1783
01:07:36,890 --> 01:07:41,710
who thinks those kinds of saints have

1784
01:07:39,290 --> 01:07:44,510
like an expiration date like two days

1785
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:45,740
before they're like I don't know yeah

1786
01:07:44,510 --> 01:07:48,680
like I think it's a matter of how much

1787
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:51,710
people use it yeah mmm but it's also I

1788
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:56,390
think in a way for our group it's almost

1789
01:07:51,710 --> 01:07:58,850
been like don't just follow trends you

1790
01:07:56,390 --> 01:08:01,040
know and I think it's kind of been what

1791
01:07:58,850 --> 01:08:03,140
it's kind of been drilled into can we

1792
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:04,700
follow trends try to I try to keep up

1793
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:06,650
with trends I'm just always late no but

1794
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:08,810
you yeah you're very late and then you

1795
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:11,780
also do it in a way that's like still

1796
01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:14,660
didn't eat yet guys

1797
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:16,040
let's eat I'm really hungry time to eat

1798
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:17,960
I don't know if it's necessarily been

1799
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:21,890
drilled into us I think the majority of

1800
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:25,550
us we're it's just in our nature to not

1801
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:26,540
I don't know when I make those if I

1802
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:29,330
ever make like a joke like that

1803
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:31,610
sometimes part of me feels like I copied

1804
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:33,260
a joke uh-huh and it makes no to me it

1805
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:36,110
makes me feel like yeah yeah yeah you

1806
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:39,680
know it's not really a joke right like

1807
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:41,360
what does heat mean again no it's not

1808
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:43,520
that's just something people say no but

1809
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:45,020
if you said like oh yeah I get hit up

1810
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:48,110
all the time for bran deals and I yeah I

1811
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:49,640
said Oh weird flex what okay I'm making

1812
01:08:48,110 --> 01:08:54,950
a joke and then we would all look at you

1813
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:57,470
like yeah but but I think that's also

1814
01:08:54,950 --> 01:08:59,900
why like you know you know how you just

1815
01:08:57,470 --> 01:09:01,640
don't copy trends like if people are

1816
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:02,570
doing challenges and stuff oh I see what

1817
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:05,000
you're saying yeah yeah

1818
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:06,470
so in a way all of us are kind of just

1819
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,120
like yeah but you're making you're right

1820
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:10,910
now you're weird flexing but okay to us

1821
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:13,040
right now you're like oh we're too good

1822
01:09:10,910 --> 01:09:14,960
for me but no but but we liked I like

1823
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:18,230
them I don't see it really late I do too

1824
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:21,230
I just don't want to do them I don't say

1825
01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:23,060
that like yeah yeah I laugh at them but

1826
01:09:21,230 --> 01:09:25,790
I don't use them as like in my arsenal

1827
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:28,370
yeah like I know once something gets so

1828
01:09:25,790 --> 01:09:30,860
overdone I get upset seeing it honestly

1829
01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:34,070
and then it becomes a joke in itself

1830
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:36,140
yeah yeah just why I think it's so like

1831
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:38,720
the dab is really knowing for a while

1832
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:42,020
and then I thought it was so funny every

1833
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:44,840
time I saw like mini mint or do it doing

1834
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:46,730
it like yeah yeah Dan I think that's

1835
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:48,860
like a whole another different level

1836
01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:50,120
yeah of comedy not like a different see

1837
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:56,060
right now where we were flexing but okay

1838
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:58,660
that's okay dude dude definitely odd

1839
01:09:56,060 --> 01:10:01,220
contraction in our muscles but certainly

1840
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:04,250
anyway um how do we get on this topic

1841
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:05,660
see this is the bad thing I should have

1842
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:08,600
took my pill during the shishi break

1843
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:11,090
honestly I think the last official topic

1844
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:13,790
we talked about was Paco said what

1845
01:10:11,090 --> 01:10:14,210
bothers you yeah that didn't even go

1846
01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:15,860
anywhere

1847
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:17,510
I wouldn't talk that's why I told you

1848
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:19,430
like so that's what no no it's fine it's

1849
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:21,440
all we're looking for is the seed that

1850
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:23,900
we can plant and then viciously whatever

1851
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:28,190
it better fractures off into okay what

1852
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:31,090
bothers me tell them I don't know dude

1853
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:34,160
grab my sleeve that bothers me as well I

1854
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:36,190
don't know I don't know what bothers me

1855
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:37,929
I was like no way

1856
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:39,280
I don't really I'd have to see here I

1857
01:10:37,929 --> 01:10:41,889
think about it because it's not really

1858
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:44,020
something that I can just pull out of my

1859
01:10:41,889 --> 01:10:45,400
I have a lot of things so what I do

1860
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:45,760
every day write about things that bother

1861
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:48,550
me

1862
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:56,260
what get them for one let me tell you

1863
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:57,820
about IKEA let's see I mean there's so

1864
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:59,980
many things you know actually one thing

1865
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:03,130
that does kind of bother me but it's

1866
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:05,260
like it shouldn't I don't I didn't I

1867
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:08,020
never understood why people hate

1868
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:09,909
Nickelback so much that's I know it's

1869
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:11,560
super random but I was just thinking

1870
01:11:09,909 --> 01:11:14,110
about it the other day yeah cuz I heard

1871
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:15,190
a Nickelback song cuz I was watching was

1872
01:11:14,110 --> 01:11:16,900
it Grey's Anatomy I don't know I was

1873
01:11:15,190 --> 01:11:18,159
watching some really old show yeah they

1874
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:19,960
had a Nickelback song I don't know what

1875
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:22,750
show it was might have not even been

1876
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:25,659
Nickelback but it reminded me and I was

1877
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:27,400
like dude they're not bad like why does

1878
01:11:25,659 --> 01:11:29,409
people like why do people hate them so

1879
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:32,080
much you know trying to think of a

1880
01:11:29,409 --> 01:11:35,920
Nickelback song is that the I remember

1881
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:37,750
though there's a music video in there I

1882
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:39,190
don't have the rights to that we might

1883
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:41,790
have to bleep it just kidding out I was

1884
01:11:39,190 --> 01:11:45,610
in look at this picture this picture

1885
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:47,590
take a glance at the picture yeah I

1886
01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:55,270
still think that one vine is hella funny

1887
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:56,710
was like what no but no but you know

1888
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:58,420
what I mean everybody that's like the I

1889
01:11:56,710 --> 01:12:00,969
know it because I go team yeah it's a

1890
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:02,139
go-to but I've always like if you I

1891
01:12:00,969 --> 01:12:03,489
guess kids wouldn't get it now cuz

1892
01:12:02,139 --> 01:12:04,719
they're not popular but back in the day

1893
01:12:03,489 --> 01:12:06,760
they were playing all the time and

1894
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:08,380
nobody had an issue with them I thought

1895
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:10,900
photograph was a great song yeah and

1896
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:13,239
there's voices very like you know like

1897
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:14,860
it's very unique but I don't know

1898
01:12:13,239 --> 01:12:16,780
there's things like that and that made

1899
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:19,090
me think of other things that people are

1900
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:20,679
I feel like they just jump on the trend

1901
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:22,480
yeah of like hating Nickelback and we're

1902
01:12:20,679 --> 01:12:23,860
like well auto-tune anything auto-tune

1903
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,060
sounds awful that's not true there's a

1904
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:27,040
lot of other than that I really like

1905
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:30,130
hearing yeah yeah you know like but that

1906
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:31,449
became a thing right um there's I mean

1907
01:12:30,130 --> 01:12:35,320
crocks is something that people like

1908
01:12:31,449 --> 01:12:38,730
yeah yeah I mean but yeah yeah but I

1909
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:41,560
mean I understand the crocks one what I

1910
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:43,630
like rocks I I think they're comfortable

1911
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:45,520
yeah I think they're goofy but they have

1912
01:12:43,630 --> 01:12:47,620
theirs they you know what I didn't think

1913
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:49,810
about it the real my real reason for not

1914
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:52,000
liking them initially was the holes

1915
01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:53,830
the holes made me feel weird I will have

1916
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,120
that thing I get like goose bumps just

1917
01:12:53,830 --> 01:12:57,250
thinking about the holes is it

1918
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:58,480
trypophobia or something like that I can

1919
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:59,890
get it I just don't wanna I don't want

1920
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:02,740
it to happen so I'm not trying to think

1921
01:12:59,890 --> 01:13:04,660
of holes right now my get that pretty

1922
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:06,670
bad that goose that you get creeped out

1923
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:08,200
by holes like just seeing like those

1924
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:10,150
that that thing you know all the bumps

1925
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:12,910
next to each other was it called I tried

1926
01:13:10,150 --> 01:13:15,580
before something like that yeah look at

1927
01:13:12,910 --> 01:13:17,560
this oh yeah you got bouncy a little bit

1928
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:19,120
you know what that you know what kind of

1929
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:20,890
trigger me like I don't I don't think I

1930
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:22,810
have that but definitely seeing those

1931
01:13:20,890 --> 01:13:25,150
patterns is weird at your old house

1932
01:13:22,810 --> 01:13:28,600
there were these dead sunflowers in a

1933
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:30,760
vase mm-hmm looking I was like oh why

1934
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:32,890
why do you have that there I don't even

1935
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:34,780
know what you're talking about so I

1936
01:13:32,890 --> 01:13:37,090
probably didn't even notice it or look

1937
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:39,580
at it right at your doorway I don't come

1938
01:13:37,090 --> 01:13:41,530
through that way oh that's right I don't

1939
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:43,240
go through the front door at my own

1940
01:13:41,530 --> 01:13:45,550
house the thing that I didn't like about

1941
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:45,910
crocs enough in the very beginning was

1942
01:13:45,550 --> 01:13:50,440
that

1943
01:13:45,910 --> 01:13:53,530
Paco's were so like crusty and oh he got

1944
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:56,290
me a new pair and I start wearing kind

1945
01:13:53,530 --> 01:14:00,340
of fresh honey I bought him Crocs for

1946
01:13:56,290 --> 01:14:02,650
his birthday he just like did not use it

1947
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:06,940
