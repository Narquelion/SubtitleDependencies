00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,270
hey guys so recently I did the ice

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,890
bucket challenge on my second channel

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,420
higatv I'm sure all of you know by now

4
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,010
but for those of you that don't it's a

5
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,860
charitable challenge where you either

6
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,540
donate $100 to an als charity or you

7
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,370
dump a bucket of ice-cold water in your

8
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,870
head and you donate $10 instead and

9
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,820
basically in my video I did the ice

10
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,380
bucket challenge and I donated $100 plus

11
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,359
whatever that video earns is going to be

12
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,590
going to the ALS Association so if you

13
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,029
can't afford to donate the hundred

14
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,740
dollars or the ten dollars you can

15
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:27,420
actually just go and view that video and

16
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,279
technically I think you'd be donating

17
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,140
like a cent or like a fraction of a cent

18
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,759
or something but anyway as always people

19
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,200
in this world love to find the negative

20
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,489
and everything especially when it

21
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,899
becomes popular it happens all the time

22
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:39,059
once something becomes really popular

23
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,440
people have a tendency to just hated all

24
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,790
of a sudden think about it remember when

25
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,440
planking first came on and it was like

26
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,820
the coolest funniest thing you could do

27
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,170
and then all of a sudden everybody else

28
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,180
are you doing it and it became the

29
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,260
lamest thing ever or like Justin Bieber

30
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,610
when he was a little kid on YouTube

31
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,559
everyone thought he was like this the

32
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,879
most talented cutest little kid ever but

33
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,680
once he got signed and made it big he

34
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,300
had more haters than anyone now he's

35
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,920
kind of generating his own haters

36
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,149
because of his actions but initially it

37
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,590
wasn't his fault or even like when we

38
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:03,090
all used to pee on each other for fun

39
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,710
and then r.kelly did it and then it was

40
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,930
no longer cool anymore so that's why we

41
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,369
stopped right that's that's why we

42
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,869
stopped doing that right basically these

43
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:11,189
people love things but a few people know

44
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:13,140
about them but once they become popular

45
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:17,130
it switches come on what kind of person

46
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:21,869
does that sound like to you get it I'm

47
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:23,220
stirring my hips hipster jokes are oh

48
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:24,840
yeah sorry

49
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,430
back to the topic in my mind the ice

50
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,930
bucket challenge was and still is a

51
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,130
positive thing yet now that it's

52
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,509
catching on it's like the worst thing

53
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,890
you can do right now these people are

54
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:34,229
saying things like people were only

55
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,430
doing this for attention now uh yeah

56
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:36,689
that's kind of the point to gain

57
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,979
attention to raise awareness

58
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:39,479
who cares if they're doing it for

59
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,040
attention they're still contributing to

60
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,420
the viral trend more than you have I'm

61
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,100
not gonna lie if I didn't see so many my

62
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,570
friends do it and so many of you didn't

63
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,159
tag me I would have never known what it

64
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,450
was I didn't even know what ALS was

65
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,890
until I heard about this challenge yeah

66
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,630
so it might be something stupid to do

67
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,100
but it did bring awareness people who do

68
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,270
the ice bucket challenge are greedy

69
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,310
because they don't want to donate the

70
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,509
hundred dollars well first let me ask

71
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,430
all the people who are saying things

72
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:00,750
like this how much did you donate what

73
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,280
have you done for an als charity what

74
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,439
have you done for any charity I mean if

75
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,790
you donated $100 or more you have every

76
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,320
right to say that but keep in mind that

77
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,789
not everyone who does this challenge is

78
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,910
as fortunate enough as you to be able to

79
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:11,470
donate that much and

80
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,820
sometimes by doing the ice bucket

81
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,620
challenge you're actually donating more

82
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,120
than $100 because of although awareness

83
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,110
and attention it brings secondly if one

84
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,880
of these videos get a million views

85
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,740
that's like a TV show commercial do you

86
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,480
even know how much those costs I don't

87
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,220
know but I'm sure it's at least in the

88
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,870
thousands which is a very generous

89
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,190
donation people shouldn't be doing this

90
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,350
because the ice bucket challenge is a

91
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,880
waste of water meanwhile in Africa this

92
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,020
is probably the biggest and most legit

93
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,430
argument that people have with this

94
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,230
challenge and yeah I'm not even gonna

95
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,460
argue here you do waste water in this

96
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,930
challenge but if you're fortunate enough

97
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,190
to have a computer or have internet

98
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,140
access and you're able to watch these

99
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,790
videos I'm pretty sure that you've

100
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,400
wasted water before and it wasn't even

101
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,810
for charity I'm like 99% sure that every

102
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,880
single person watching this video and

103
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,290
myself are able to waste like a little

104
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,580
bit of water every single day and we do

105
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,660
it whether we want to or not but don't

106
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,070
pretend like you grew up in a

107
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,870
third-world country you've never wasted

108
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,250
food water or anything before if you're

109
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,630
complaining about wasting a little water

110
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,310
for charity then you better be peeing

111
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,510
and pooping in your shower every single

112
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,890
night because flushing the toilet waste

113
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,910
way more water than the ice bucket

114
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,560
challenge and that's not even for

115
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,090
charity but ya know wasting water for

116
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,410
your comfort is much more important than

117
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,850
charity in fact if you're that concerned

118
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,170
over water you shouldn't even be

119
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,400
showering every single night you should

120
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,350
only be showering when you absolutely

121
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,970
have to or like if you're really sweaty

122
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,590
and also you better be getting dirty and

123
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,240
sweaty by accident from natural causes

124
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,380
because guess what if you're working out

125
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,880
you're also wasting water

126
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,230
you're burning unnecessary calories

127
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,610
which causes your body heat to rise and

128
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,810
because of homeostasis you start to

129
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,190
sweat and because of that sweat you get

130
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,450
thirsty and because you're thirsty now

131
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,650
you have to drink water that's your

132
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,270
fault so for all you lazy people out

133
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,100
there that don't work out thank you for

134
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,630
saving the planet and also for all the

135
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,040
people wondering why the ice bucket

136
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,750
challenge why did this challenge start

137
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,190
with ice water instead of just donating

138
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,959
the sad truth is nobody would have

139
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,430
watched let alone share a video of

140
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,989
someone just donating and trying to

141
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,340
raise awareness by talking about it the

142
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:46,930
ice bucket challenge is when made it

143
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,130
shareable I made it a trend I was taking

144
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,630
those other challenge videos that people

145
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,430
just watch for entertainment purposes

146
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:53,410
and making it charitable that's right

147
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,910
again for charity nobody got mad about

148
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,230
the waste of cinnamon for the cinnamon

149
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,060
challenge certain world countries need

150
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,020
spices too with all that being said to

151
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,090
anyone who's actually done the ice

152
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,470
bucket challenge and donated despite all

153
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,150
the negativity you might be getting now

154
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,770
I still believe this is a wonderful

155
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,420
trend and a great cause and thank you so

156
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,920
much for doing it and continuing to

157
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,570
spread this campaign I still support it

158
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,040
100% if you're in a place that's in a

159
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,520
drought or some days that water is

160
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,590
scarce

161
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,270
I I completely understand your concern

162
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,709
for saving water but rather than hating

163
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:19,299
in the comment section which does

164
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:21,190
nothing but bring negativity why not

165
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:21,750
just find a solution compromise I mean

166
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,920
they're still

167
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,540
you can do the challenge without wasting

168
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,130
water my friend Jeremy Lin just did it

169
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,390
by throwing himself into the ocean and

170
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,250
if you're still really that concerned

171
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:30,720
over saving a bucket of water I'm going

172
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:33,870
to help you out right now by starting

173
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,110
this new campaign called the save water

174
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,370
pee in the shower campaign every single

175
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,780
time you have to pee you pee right into

176
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,070
the drain of your shower but you don't

177
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,600
wash it down into the end of the night

178
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,830
when you take a shower so it all washes

179
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,120
together at once that's like three to

180
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,380
four flushes a day you'll be saving

181
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,700
depending on how much you pee or I

182
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,290
suppose you can do it the other way

183
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,400
around and pee into a toilet all day and

184
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,390
then when you finally flush at the end
