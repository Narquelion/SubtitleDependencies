1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,149
okay so this video is something I should

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:04,589
have done a very long time ago but what

3
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:05,970
can I say I'm a procrastinator I'm sure

4
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,950
you've noticed but almost every single

5
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,450
youtuber other than me has like really

6
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,469
good branding on their channels you know

7
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,719
like they all have those really nice

8
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:15,030
channel banners and updated playlists

9
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,529
and logos and tuka but most importantly

10
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,029
they all have this channel trailer that

11
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:20,010
when someone new comes to their channel

12
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:21,300
they can see this really cool epic

13
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,500
trailer of what their channel is all

14
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,850
about so that people get excited to

15
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,740
subscribe to them yeah after nine years

16
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,820
of being on YouTube I still don't have

17
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,859
one of those I think for the longest

18
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,480
time I had my draw my life video as the

19
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:32,040
trailer I'm just terrible at branding in

20
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,020
fact my banner is still one of the

21
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,399
default banners that YouTube offers you

22
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,110
when you first make a channel I mean to

23
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,600
be fair it is a nice banner I mean those

24
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,309
autofocus colorful light ball things are

25
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,899
actually really nice that's why I picked

26
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:44,520
it because it's a new year I'm gonna

27
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:46,829
start the year off right after 9 years

28
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,760
of YouTube procrastination no more I

29
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:52,440
finally have a channel trailer confetti

30
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,270
I mean it is two weeks into the year so

31
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,280
I guess I kind of procrastinated on this

32
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,140
video and actually I still don't have a

33
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,489
logo yet I haven't been updating my

34
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,809
playlist and as for my channel banner I

35
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:05,430
know you know what my channel banner is

36
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:07,409
fine who cares if it's a default banner

37
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,610
it's nice I love those autofocus

38
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:11,760
colorful ball things

39
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:16,320
thanks Ryan we love you too what the I

40
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,030
started making videos in O six didn't

41
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,920
think much of it just did some lip sings

42
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,659
random skits you know it was just me and

43
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,640
my friends having fun

44
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:26,229
I had no idea other people will be

45
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,149
watching I still don't know why people

46
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:31,840
watch but I'm thankful for it you know

47
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:33,789
it changed my life you know I went from

48
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,560
being this depressed bullied kid who

49
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:38,049
just wanted to be someone else to being

50
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,700
confident just happy to be me and that's

51
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:41,590
what this channel is all about you know

52
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,390
being yourself being different being

53
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,159
weird if you want to put on a wig and

54
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,390
lip-sync to the song barbie girl you'd

55
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:47,920
do it if you want to go and share

56
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,360
command me out of your hands but it's

57
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,590
always been your childhood dream then

58
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,850
make it happen if you want to be a

59
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,829
singer even though you've been told

60
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,299
countless times that you can't sing it

61
00:01:53,829 --> 00:01:57,549
doesn't matter because the only person

62
00:01:55,299 --> 00:02:02,470
that can stop you it's you because it's

63
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:04,179
never too late to be yourself are you

64
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,229
done because I mean nobody really asked

65
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:06,459
you for your whole life store what do

66
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:07,840
you mean I thought this whole thing was

67
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,369
a clip from an old interview or

68
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,780
something nope just part of the trailer

69
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:12,190
and you're still talking over all the

70
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,900
best parts well I mean I was just trying

71
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,640
to make it a little more inspirational

72
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,110
and didn't even make sense it just means

73
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,610
that it's not too late to do what you

74
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,930
want to it's also not too late for you

75
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,880
to leave because I mean I'm the one

76
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:32,459
