1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,529
I am NOT InFocus sorry guys I'm sick I

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:09,510
have to deal with the nays on these

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:10,440
nasal Ness nasal eNOS hey guys so today

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,269
I'm gonna be talking about one of my

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:21,119
biggest pet peeves and that pet peeve

6
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:23,310
just so happens to be you know when

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,990
people text message you one word at a

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,760
time rather than putting all the texts

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,220
into one text message so now you have

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:36,180
like 20 notifications yeah I hate that

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:37,590
oh and also overdramatic oh come on

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,980
you gotta be kidding I'm not even gonna

13
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:43,950
redo this I'm just gonna let it go Oh

14
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:46,020
drama dick um so as I was mentioning

15
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,090
earlier we probably all know at least

16
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,410
one overdramatic person and if you don't

17
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,660
have anyone like this in your life it's

18
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,890
probably because it's you and you don't

19
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,170
think that you're being overdramatic

20
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,789
because more dramatic situations are

21
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,170
like normal situations too overdramatic

22
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:59,579
people and it's not necessarily a bad

23
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,770
thing it's just people like myself

24
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,180
warned vonda's drama get a little

25
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,049
annoyed sometimes when you guys know

26
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,159
what kind of people I'm talking about

27
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,600
right these are the people that can

28
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,750
literally make a big deal out of

29
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,760
anything no matter how small it is oh my

30
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,400
god what Dana posted a picture on

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,200
Instagram 20 minutes ago so so that

32
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,509
means she's on Instagram and that's bad

33
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:23,009
yeah she didn't like my post no tiger

34
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:24,750
not like 3 hours ago yeah that's awful

35
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,250
and by making this a bigger deal these

36
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,659
people actually create drama that was

37
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,040
never there who's something you're not

38
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,390
actually Nicole over there I have to

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,829
confront her she's my best friend what

40
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,670
if she just didn't see it okay I tagged

41
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:33,900
her and I know she keeps her

42
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,070
notifications on so she definitely saw

43
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,850
him chose not to like it so there's

44
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,890
something a hundred thousand percent

45
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,390
wrong I have talked to rich and even

46
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:44,399
when they come to realize that there was

47
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:47,909
no drama in the first place hey where's

48
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,470
your problem with me huh oh yeah I know

49
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:51,420
so why don't you like it I think I know

50
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,530
you posted yeah right I tagged you in at

51
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,939
like three hours ago

52
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,020
see I mean come on we always like each

53
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,610
other's photos and like I don't even

54
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,009
know what why you you tagged the wrong

55
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:02,430
account me why yeah yeah mine is I'm

56
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,960
over the underscore but being the

57
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,820
overdramatic person that they are they

58
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,409
somehow find a way to create even more

59
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,319
drama out of that because what's life

60
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:10,989
without drama

61
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,549
I'm so sorry no no don't even worry

62
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:15,099
about it I would do the same girl I know

63
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:17,439
like totally overreacted so crazy

64
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:22,599
oh look Ryan even warned me that you're

65
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:32,590
on your way oh right that's so funny oh

66
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:34,780
my god it's so funny you know when

67
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,430
people text messaged you one word at a

68
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,230
time rather than putting all the texts

69
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:42,849
into one text message so now you have

70
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:44,769
like 20 notifications yeah as you can

71
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:46,239
probably see overdramatic people or some

72
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:47,139
of the most annoying people in the world

73
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,060
but if you want look on the bright side

74
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:50,260
while being annoying they're actually

75
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,700
some of the most interesting and

76
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,590
entertaining people to be around because

77
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,879
they're never bored bored is an emotion

78
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,010
that overdramatic people will hardly

79
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,720
ever feel because their mind can make

80
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,799
anything and everything seem important

81
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,900
and interesting they have the power to

82
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:04,030
basically take nothing and turn it into

83
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,349
an incredibly important big deal it's

84
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,090
basically like clickbait she has a

85
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:16,870
pretty good sing overdramatic people are

86
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:26,620
basically like limbing click babies come

87
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:29,109
here rocket come here come here what's

88
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,030
wrong nothing just on my period come on

89
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:32,530
aren't you being a little overdramatic

90
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,819
excuse me how would you know what do I

91
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,310
feel like if you never had one before

92
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:56,590
wait a second wait no you're right I've

93
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:58,629
never had a period before okay obviously

94
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,250
I exaggerated but that's kind of the

95
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:01,479
whole point that's a textbook example of

96
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,340
an overdramatic person taking a

97
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:05,079
situation that barely happened and then

98
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,759
making into something that you would see

99
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,390
in a YouTube thumbnail it actually got

100
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:09,770
me kind of interested in got me thinking

101
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,450
like what makes over demand people want

102
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:13,250
to do this is it because they love drama

103
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,240
or maybe they just want more attention I

104
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,380
just couldn't figure it out then I

105
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,790
thought maybe I'm wrong you know maybe

106
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,170
it's not for attention or because they

107
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,609
love drama some people are just

108
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,900
different I mean there's two ends of the

109
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:22,670
spectrum there just like emotional

110
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,050
thinkers and logical thinkers and I

111
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,730
think if you're on the emotional side

112
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,930
that's like the overdramatic people

113
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,370
people like myself are more on the

114
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,080
logical side and just to be clear I'm

115
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,640
not saying either side is wrong we're

116
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,020
just different people emotional people

117
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,220
may see things completely different from

118
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,780
a logical person and it's because they

119
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,770
literally see life in a different way I

120
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,630
mean if that's the case it's actually

121
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,220
pretty amazing because like for over

122
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,810
today people are always exciting their

123
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,070
life is like a movie it's a drama

124
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,540
you see I presented all those skits

125
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,460
earlier from my perspective the you know

126
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,810
the boring perspective the logical one

127
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,770
but imagine what those little situations

128
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:52,630
would look like from the point of view

129
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:52,630
of a overdramatic person take a look

130
00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:00,880
I don't know how to tell you this I

131
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,180
don't even know how it happened I'm

132
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,180
pregnant

133
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,420
there's no legality

134
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:16,699
go

135
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,010
pregnant I have a baby inside how is

136
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,010
that even possible

137
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,450
you know what build what are you talking

138
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,450
about

139
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,680
button nipples rjp who don't even have

140
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,810
don't you ever talk my nipples a kid

141
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,660
anyway the moral of the story here is

142
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,340
that there are just different types of

143
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,139
people in this world yes those overly

144
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,460
emotional overly dramatic people who

145
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:56,930
might seem incredibly annoying to

146
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,220
someone like me and I'm sure a bunch of

147
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,330
you as well I mean it's not their fault

148
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,590
that's just how they think that's just

149
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,090
how they see life so if you ever get

150
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,500
annoyed or you have to deal with an

151
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,930
overdramatic person in your life don't

152
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,520
even bother trying to be reason that

153
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,650
you're never gonna win in trying to

154
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,090
convince a overdramatic over emotional

155
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,440
thinker to think logically because

156
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,970
that's just not who they are my advice

157
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,010
to you and the only thing that you can

158
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,560
do is to just accept them for who they

159
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,419
are admit defeat let them be there or

160
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,310
there's also one last trick you could

161
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:26,060
also speak their language be even more

162
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:27,020
overdramatic than they are so how long

163
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,850
