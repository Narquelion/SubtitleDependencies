9
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,440
channel but on the TV I released a video

10
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,359
announcing it and got over a hundred

11
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,830
thousand pound loads in one day it was

12
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,449
like number 10 in the App Store for

13
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,710
iPhone user and for Android it was like

14
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:23,970

description box below but with that

21
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,130
being said here's another idea why do I

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,989
keep saying that there's another dear

23
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,579
Ryan here we go you're right show us how

24
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:40,079
you would confess to someone you like

25
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,520
I'm just gonna be completely honest the

26
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,379
last time I think I literally told

27
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,820
somebody that I liked them was probably

28
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,410
in high school and I'm really

29
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,690
embarrassed but I'm it's it's in the

30
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,829
past I I did it over aim if you guys

31
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,360
don't know what that means it's an

32
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:52,710
instant messenger kind of like MSN

33
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,969
Messenger not that you guys would know

34
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,890
what that is it's like facebook

35
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:57,210
Messenger it was for AOL you guys don't

36
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,829
know what a o L is what am I talking

37
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,120
about anyway I did it over the internet

38
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,320
and I'm really embarrassed about it

39
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,760
because you should say that kind of

40
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,170
thing in person to someone kind of like

41
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,560
how I would do it now something like

42
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:10,260
this hey could I talk to you about

43
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,330
something listen this is awkward I I

44
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,670
know we've been friends and just friends

45
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,200
for a really long time now but I can't I

46
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:30,150
just can't hold it back anymore I think

47
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:32,130
it's time you know well I do Ryan can

48
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,720
you parody the Big Bang Theory okay let

49
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,939
me first say that I actually really

50
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,500
really like this show when it first came

51
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:39,030
up I absolutely loved the first two

52
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,619
seasons but then I started to notice how

53
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,150
much they use the left truck if you ever

54
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:44,220
do get around to watching that show or

55
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,720
if you already do then try and count how

56
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,189
many times they use a laugh track every

57
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,630
episode what irritates me the most is

58
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:50,220
that they do it on parts that are not

59
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,630
even intended to be funny but yeah you

60
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,049
still laugh because you hear other

61
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,049
people laughing

62
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:04,109
Sheldon what are you doing

63
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:05,569
my my spot it feels different for some

64
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:07,829
reason did you change it

65
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:10,440
Sheldon it's a couch it's not gonna

66
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:11,970
change that's just not true it off a

67
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,230
chemical compound can change is surely a

68
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,510
physical sitting device can go through a

69
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,400
physical changes well you know that's

70
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,840
not what I'm talking about Sheldon I

71
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:24,720
never know what you're talking about

72
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:30,120
oh that's just rude is it yes this is

73
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,530
what what see what I mean I just hate

74
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,269
when shows put in laugh tracks to make

75
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,500
it feel like you should be laughing even

76
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:35,970
though nothing funny happening it's like

77
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,560
come on like where did all the

78
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,629
intelligent comedy go and what it was

79
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,769
with all this immature forced comedy Oh

80
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:42,360
like you can do better

81
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:45,510
yeah as a matter of fact I probably

82
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:50,069
could then go ahead okay um the Big Bang

83
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:52,260
Theory more like the big fart theory get

84
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:56,690

86
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,569

121
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,669
facts I made a video about extremely

122
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,110
lazy people and how those people are

123
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:01,370
actually the smartest people because

124
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,630
they come up with solutions to solve

125
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,130
problem well that's exactly what life

126
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,510
hacks are so basically I just took a

127
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,070
bunch of things that I can relate to the

128
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,360
most and I came up with solutions in the

129
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,830
same way here's some of my facts that I

130
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,360
can relate to I hope you guys do as well

131
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,919
the diet life hack are you one of those

132
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,450
people that likes to start diets but

133
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:16,070
always ends up giving up on them well

134
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,630
this life hack is really easy all you

135
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,250
have to do is buy a bunch of mirrors and

136
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,930
attach it to all your unhealthy food

137
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,010
with a little note that says you and

138
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:26,900
you'll probably never break your diet

139
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:28,100
again the phone finder now if you're

140
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,539
like me and you're always losing your

141
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,100
phone this one's perfect for you all you

142
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:32,600
got to do is attach a cord to your phone

143
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,950
and make that cord attached to some kind

144
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,390
of base and put that base on a wall

145
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:38,840
there you have it you'll never lose it

146
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:40,639
again unless you lose your house before

147
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,780
it filter now I know this one doesn't

148
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,280

softener and tape it to your underwear

162
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,160

170
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,830
seriousness I know that you guys want

171
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,750
real life hacks and I actually do have

172
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,890
one real life and I know you guys

173
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,900
probably have already heard about this

174
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:30,190
because I've seen posts about it but I

175
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,410
have been doing this since middle school

176
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:35,140
before the internet even existed that's

177
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:38,050
not true it existed but it was slow and

178
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:39,970
I had dial-up then and there was no post

179
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,890
about this at the time so I invented

180
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,090
this life hack that's not sure I learned

181
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,440
it from my mom she probably learned it

182
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:47,080
from other people basically it's called

183
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,550
the shower steam ironing thing I don't

184
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,680
know why it's not even that hard but I

185
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,850
hate doing it I hate ironing my clothes

186
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,530
so have you ever seen me in public

187
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,000

188
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:56,260
wrinkled or I use this life and

189
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,330
basically all you got to do is take a

190
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,980
hot shower and bring whatever clothes it

191
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,150
is with you into the shower with you you

192
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,470
just gotta hang it somewhere where the

193
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,490
steam is hitting it but not the water

194
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,960
now once you're done with your shower

195
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,550
