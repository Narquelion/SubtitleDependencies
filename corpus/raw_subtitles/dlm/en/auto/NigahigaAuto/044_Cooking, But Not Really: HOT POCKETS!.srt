1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,170
hey Brian welcome back to another

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:21,000
cooking we're sure Papa Sue's yeah yeah

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:23,340
they're right remember this show I did

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,750
this with Shawn about two three years

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,449
ago actually last time we did was with

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:31,410
you we did it for Shawn yeah it wasn't

7
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:32,969
as good what part of you watch the show

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,890
you might be wondering why it's on this

9
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:36,690
chap there wasn't any vlog type of stuff

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,399
on this channel before but I figured

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,780
it's time I'm gonna have more personal

12
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,390
stuff on this channel things that are

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:46,320
shows that are around what I do I don't

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,520
cook I know I said that I'm lying but

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,930
not really and you know what I've

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,340
actually learned a lot and the

17
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,629
difference is we don't have Shawn this

18
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,300
time that's my little worried because

19
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,309
last time we had Paco it was so hard

20
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,780
because you don't know I mean I don't

21
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:59,010
know how to cook I'll admit that I don't

22
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,280
know how to cook that's why I made this

23
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,690
show I know how to cook you do not he

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,070
doesn't know how to more than you okay

25
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,049
so well here's a scenario all the guys

26
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,939
who we normally cook for the rest of our

27
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,770
hpc they're not in town right now so

28
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:12,270
basically have to make something that

29
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,470
will last two days because that's when

30
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,210
everyone gets best so what are you gonna

31
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,520
do today what are we making one last two

32
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:23,340
days and then we can meet I guess we

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,840
need ideas huh a little bit aside oh we

34
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,270
should make our own why we just make

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,799
Papa but like our own versions dessert a

36
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,570
dessert a hot pot we can do a dessert

37
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,920
one yeah we should do a dessert one but

38
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,479
we need like a meal or do we just be

39
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,939
like cheeseburgers so you have patties

40
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,590
and then put cheese like some onions or

41
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:41,430
like any kind of burger we want you make

42
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:44,220
it negative and we make fries but the

43
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,710
prize itself are hot pockets we hollow

44
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,659
out the fries and we put cheese and

45
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,280
stuff inside the fries sender like fry

46
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,500
hot pockets I don't know how that's

47
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,630
possible you've ever had cheese and

48
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,229
fries they're really cheesy fries yeah

49
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,479
yeah

50
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,430
but to be a hot pocket but things got to

51
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,719
be on the inside not the outside that's

52
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,520
different it's kind of like what's

53
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,520
realistic right

54
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,130
second you know what we're doing it this

55
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:11,170
is our show best pen ingredients what do

56
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:13,270
we need for the hot pocket mm-hmm we are

57
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:15,490

61
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,110
of we don't because I don't have it so

62
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:25,270
I'm kind of syringe or Smith it inject

63
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:29,050
the food with to fill up the dessert

64
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:32,140
yeah this is why you don't throw stuff

65
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:33,970
into your cards I didn't know I

66
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,680
literally have never made anything like

67
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:38,170
this before so how do you open these

68
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,500
just just bring it open right just like

69
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:44,320
that it's pop it like this yeah oh oh

70
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,730
dude how much do you think like how big

71
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,380
does this get when you heat it up

72
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:51,490
how many pockets is it come across the

73
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:54,430
key take it out part what take this much

74
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:55,990
no stretch it you know maybe don't do

75
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,300
that maybe what do we do with it then I

76
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:04,720

78
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:22,959

eat that again that's not cooked at them

150
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:50,400
all right here it is right all right so

151
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,720
we have our dough it's a little bit more

152
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,510
rectangular I guess I'll baggage cheap

153
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,880
but this time we cut the burger and we

154
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,570
cook the burger more in the shape that

155
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:04,690
we want

156
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:06,640
oh yeah that's pretty good Jody but you

157
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,710
know what that's just how our pockets

158
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,210
are this is our test if this works we're

159
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:12,810
gonna make a bunch of these in two days

160
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:15,580
for the guys and see how it turns out

161
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:17,380
let's fill it out but you know what who

162
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,990
hasn't made a hot pocket this goes out a

163
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:23,020
little bit from that it's right so the

164
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:25,510
shape is a little wider and higher than

165
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:27,940
it should be for our pocket button looks

166
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:31,090
pretty solid to me so let's try this bad

167
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:33,400
boy there we go oh yeah that looks good

168
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:35,740
that is hot still don't burn on the

169
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,840
bottom but it looks good dude this looks

170
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:49,450
like something this looks like real food

171
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:51,400
I blew it for us we're good

172
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:53,920
not bad Shawn would be proud of this

173
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,300
sometimes you make these things and they

174
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,910
look cool but they're not the best

175
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,590
