00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,580
if you would stop interrupting me I'll

102
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,580
be done by now

103
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,469
there's too many make words I don't know

104
00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:02,009
my card with darkness hide and the Sun

105
00:04:58,469 --> 00:05:04,710
shan't go just with each inside look in

106
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:06,869
a and that's all for darkness hides

107
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,490
something that you can look inside of

108
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:09,749
thanking me anything

109
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,490
I mean if it's anything like the other

110
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:12,899
note we know that it has to rhyme right

111
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,909
yeah that doesn't narrow it down much

112
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:19,279
there's so many words that rhyme lingo I

113
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:19,279
would know I'm a rapper there's flow and

114
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,419
bow look whatever it is maybe if we

115
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:27,180
figure out before the killer strikes

116
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:29,039
again we can stop it what how no wait

117
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,539
Sam is right if we figured out this note

118
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,559
before the blackout we could have

119
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,330
stopped the ray from getting the ice

120
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:34,099
tray you're rapping again trying to mock

121
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,719
me dawg

122
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:38,189
guys we have to find this next clue how

123
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:40,559
if we don't even know what we're looking

124
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:41,459
for what we do kinda we just have to

125
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:43,830
look for something that you can look

126
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:45,839
inside of that's in the darkness and

127
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:48,029
rhymes with go oh what about like bold

128
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,740
bold I said it first yeah things like

129
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:51,539
that got it I'm on boy I'm ready to go

130
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,919
let's go this is crazy how much Steve

131
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:54,749
what a crazy idea I don't make it stupid

132
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,370
look if that's the only clue we're going

133
00:05:54,749 --> 00:05:59,430
off of we'd have to search this entire

134
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,629
house which is why and I again I know

135
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,129
this is gonna sound like something

136
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:05,809
straight out of a horror movie but I

137
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:07,620
think we should split up into pairs

138
00:06:05,809 --> 00:06:09,629
something straight out of a horror

139
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,789
movies right that sounds like a bad idea

140
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:16,319
I mean do you have a better idea - do

141
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:22,499
any of you what if instead we all play

142
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:24,330
the Wii the Wii like we is in the gaming

143
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:26,819
console yeah it has enough controller

144
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:28,889
for everybody yeah sounds way more fine

145
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:31,110
oh is that gonna help us find the next

146
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:33,300
clue on it eh ha ha I don't know am I

147
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:40,469

00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:42,689
is dead okay oh my god who I give up I

149
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:44,309

at what to say it's just goodbye Steven

239
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,630
which means again the killers one step

240
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,980
ahead of us

241
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:47,620
wait a second it has a goodbye Steven

242
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:52,540
yeah his name of Steve there's only one

243
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:56,230
person here that caught him Steven what

244
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,220
Regina you didn't see him what I mean

245
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,690
you're the only one that calls him

246
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:02,589
Steven and if he weren't the only one in

247
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:04,960
the room with him talk about how you

248
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:07,029
shot Steve in the bed what how would you

249
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,190
say that I thought you guys were my

250
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:11,830
friends look we are your friends Regina

251
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:14,620
but all the facts care about the facts

252
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:16,390
just you know already what just because

253
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,010
I was partnered with Steven and I was

254
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:20,170
the only one in the room and even though

255
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,940
I love God and I accidentally shot two

256
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:23,470
people in the back who both happened to

257
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:26,530
be standing rid of a toilet as well

258
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:29,230
doesn't mean I wanna get it we are in

259
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:33,040
love even though he didn't love me back

260
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:34,870
we were in love I believe now I remember

261
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,180
the first time we met it feels like it

262
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:39,460
was just yesterday you guys just met

263
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:41,620
like a couple hours ago love has no time

264
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,570
right but the way that you guys are

265
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,120
attacking me even though someone I love

266
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:49,300
just got a shot I wouldn't expect any of

267
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,160
you to know what love means I'll have an

268
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,530
I guess we did point fingers pretty

269
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,420
quickly yeah and I suppose that anyone

270
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:57,100
could have met they conceived for Steven

271
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,680
phone and I mean we didn't actually see

272
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,330
her do it no it really does look like

273
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,400
she actually was in love with him

274
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:07,300
despite only being a couple of all right

275
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,770
what what are we doing what it's just

276
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,529
everything you just said you just seemed

277
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:13,810
so sad yeah moved on I was like one

278
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:15,400
minute ago I just met him tonight how

279
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:17,260
long he expect me to be sad about it

280
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:20,020
love it's all about time Ryan and even

281
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,520
loving that long I mean okay then I

282
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,950
guess we'll just move on okay what are

283
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,600
we

284
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:25,460
well we still haven't found the answer

285
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,720
to the other clue but if it's anything

286
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,350
like the other one it has to be around

287
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,089
here somewhere

288
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:31,550
well then again we're darkness hides in

289
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:33,980
the sunshine goal just reach inside look

290
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:35,330
in uh you know what that's what we're

291
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,370
trying to figure out Oh

292
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:39,200
what about hole yeah that I could

293
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:40,850
actually work I mean I suppose it's

294
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,380
usually dark inside of holes right and

295
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,640
you can wreath inside of it well you

296
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,630
mean like a hole in the ground how are

297
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,080
we supposed to find out on the third

298
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:48,890
floor

299
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:53,570
I got it I know where it is but where

300
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:55,820
it's in Steve's butt hole beneath what

301
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:57,920
think about it where darkness highs in

302
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:00,260
the Sun can't go that's when the Sun

303
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,080
doesn't shine that's a butt and the next

304
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:08,050
part is just reach inside look in a hole

305
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:08,050
a hole [ __ ] it's a [ __ ]

306
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:15,320
lion doing its own like a mean no no not

307
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:17,959
me I mean Regina it was your idea and I

308
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:20,180
mean you were the closest to him so yeah

309
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:21,529
no I don't care how much I loved him

310
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,160
right reaching into the booty like

311
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:25,760
groceries

312
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:32,510
that's gross Suri's oh that's why they

313
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:34,820
say that all right this does not leave

314
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:36,320
the bathroom ever no way

315
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,120
no of course none of us are gonna say

316
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,220
anything oh my god you're actually gonna

317
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,900
do it well what other choice do we have

318
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,029
I was just gonna recommend my other idea

319
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,290
but this is funnier what other idea I

320
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:46,130
was gonna say we should just check the

321
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,540
other home first

322
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:50,709
what do you mean another what what hold

323
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,709
the random hole behind you

324
00:15:55,089 --> 00:15:59,229
it's warm how long ago did you see this

325
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:00,909
a while ago before you guys even got

326
00:15:59,229 --> 00:16:02,349
here then why didn't you say something

327
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:03,519
earlier I don't know I just didn't think

328
00:16:02,349 --> 00:16:05,199
it was important it was just a random

329
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,669
poet's smoke coming on and you thought

330
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,139
that a random holding the wall with

331
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:09,549
smoke coming out of it right after

332
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:11,079
someone got shot was it worth mentioning

333
00:16:09,549 --> 00:16:12,129
you know what I don't need to take this

334
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:14,319
from you you're a mother thing someone

335
00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:19,889
follow you we're at all wait there's

336
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:22,719
something in here it's the next clue

337
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:25,539
don't stand in thought from the prize

338
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:27,339
pour the blank and it will blink yeah we

339
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:28,479
got to figure out two now there's no way

340
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:30,099
we're gonna figure this out

341
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:32,769
we couldn't even figure out one I agree

342
00:16:30,099 --> 00:16:34,419
I mean I say we all stick together and

343
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:35,439
make sure that we all know where

344
00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:37,329
everyone is if someone goes missing

345
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:38,829
we'll assume that they're the killer we

346
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:41,649
just all have to stick together as a

347
00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:43,779
whole make sense wait a second say it

348
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:45,489
again Brian really like the whole thing

349
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:47,799
because that was like a lot of words you

350
00:16:45,489 --> 00:16:50,949
said stick together as a whole

351
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:54,009
yeah that's it holes where darkness

352
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:57,489
hides and the sunshine goal just reach

353
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:59,879
inside look in it where you guys going I

354
00:16:57,489 --> 00:17:04,059
have to answer we already do that one oh

355
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:05,860

00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,549
get hungers just eat the candy that

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,059

00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:20,860
just like are you a dip audio inside

364
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,509
lemonade

365
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:25,179

366
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:27,220

mean we'll fill me with him fine just be

371
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,590
quick because we're really getting

372
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:37,179
off-topic hi

373
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:39,249
all right so how are we gonna figure

374
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:41,169
this out well the clue did say something

375
00:17:39,249 --> 00:17:43,090
about being in thought from surprise

376
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:44,409
meaning they've all been surprises so

377
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,940
far through that you know what the

378
00:17:44,409 --> 00:17:48,070
ending is actually pretty interesting if

379
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:50,019
you pour something it was something like

380
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:51,909
why are you can part water yeah I mean

381
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:57,490
like any liquid really anything that you

382
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:58,210
can pour I guess huh I almost forget

383
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:00,100
about that

384
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,450
how does pouring something even kill

385
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,669
someone well you can party lava on

386
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,770
someone yes you could that is one option

387
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:06,750
to given

388
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,010
how would I even relate to being sorry

389
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,840
for my surprise I mean I'd be pretty

390
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:18,060
shocked to be pardon lava on me wouldn't

391
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:21,960
you be burnt still good

392
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:24,000
they don't stand in shock liquids what

393
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,590
liquids are conductive come to wet Tim

394
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,120
you would literally be shocked if you

395
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,680
poured it on the wrong thing oh that's a

396
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,900
stupid one then all we have to do is not

397
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:44,840
pour something and we live right now why

398
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:48,240
would we even pour anything Oh what I

399
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:50,130

coke and it will rise well if we figured

405
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,820

this is an unlucky room it's the final

418
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:59,800
clue time has come for you to be what we

419
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:05,560
do this in another room cuz that's

420
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:11,620
bodies all burn it smells alright here

421
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:13,060
we go the time has come to smell it okay

422
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:15,310
are we good now we're literally a floor

423
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:18,250
apart it's not like thrashing hair Tibet

424
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:20,260
ready the time has come for you to be

425
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,480
wise make a choice if you wish to

426
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,580
survive you have all the information you

427
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,490
need I've told no lies for every

428
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:29,260
Halloween you gotta be kidding me what

429
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,550
there's five blank slate so this is it

430
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,080
it has to be one of us

431
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:33,610
I mean that's what it sounds like and

432
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,930
according to this we're supposed to have

433
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:36,340
all the information we need to figure

434
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,870
out who it is we don't have any

435
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,820
information other than the fact that we

436
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,500
know it's not me what we don't know that

437
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,300
and now that you said that I'm kind of

438
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,340
leaning towards you don't lean on me I'm

439
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,750
not major guys not what guys we can

440
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,160
point fingers all we want but the only

441
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,690
way we're gonna prove it is by solving

442
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:53,290
this that's impossible

443
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:55,000
or I have idea that 100% okay huh all we

444
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:56,650
have to do is wait until a kid or kill

445
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,170
everybody then we know the last guy

446
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:01,270
standing is kid up brilliant that does

447
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:02,530
work that defeats the whole purpose why

448
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,940
would we care what the killer is if

449
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:05,410
we're all dead I don't know this is

450
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,760
exactly why a part of me thinks that we

451
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:08,350
should wait a second what if it isn't

452
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,730
one of us what are you talking about

453
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:13,390
we're the only ones left no we're not

454
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:14,980
has anyone seen rocky lately last time I

455
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:16,930
had a rocky it was upstairs we're

456
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,790
upstairs by the cloak I played him down

457
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:20,380
to make the call but rocky would never

458
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:22,150
do such thing are you sure about that

459
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,070
because I knew something was not the

460
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:25,360
moment I met him yeah Ryan did say if

461
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,890
you leave the group we assume you're the

462
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,690
killer so why didn't you follow us down

463
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:31,120
here alright that true yeah cuz he's a

464
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,680
freaking Rock okay are you guys kidding

465
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,480
me I'm almost at the point where I'd

466
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:37,000
rather be killed by one of you than to

467
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,280
listen to your stupid idiotic useless

468
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,280
ideas that sounds like something a

469
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,890
killer would say yeah hi oh my God where

470
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,020
were you during the black Owen

471
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:47,520
stand by the ice tray the exact same

472
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,930
place is you how would you know where I

473
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,970
was if there was a blackout sounds

474
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:52,530
suspicious to me wait what what about

475
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:54,750
when Steve got shot in the same room as

476
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:56,040
me were you then not in that room so

477
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,720
first you were saying you were in the

478
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,040
same room as me when Ray died now all of

479
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,050
a sudden you're in a different room and

480
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,640
Steve died sound like something's not

481
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:05,340
adding up oh it's all coming together

482
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,930
now that makes no sense and last but not

483
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,250
least when Hannity was pouring the coke

484
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,630
in it was rising to spilling they're

485
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,250
gonna form a deadly part of the I was

486
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,960
gonna put my hand in but Dan's jumped

487
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,060
inside the way it for me instead of die

488
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,280
instead where are you that out of all of

489
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:18,870
you probably the furthest away from her

490
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,880
in fact I don't even think that that

491
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:22,830
needs to happen she only died trying to

492
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,630
save you that may be so but you didn't

493
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:29,030
die trying to save Pam trying to save me

494
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:31,470
now did you check me or is it just check

495
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:34,380
check all the clues finally makes sense

496
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:36,060
the ice tray the hole the coke rise what

497
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,820
do they all have in common you put ice

498
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:42,090
inside of the coke you put coke inside

499
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:46,170
of the hole and the hole will rise to

500
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:47,490
that you know the hook it will rock okay

501
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:50,100
know you're innocent because mouths

502
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:52,470
don't rise wait a second that's it what

503
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,790
I straight hole coke and rise that's

504
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:55,050
that's five words that's what that's

505
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,070
with the clue man what are you talking

506
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,510

entire video to tell the story you only

00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:50,070
gave me five seconds and there was after

552
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:52,860
the teach you're doing all of this

553
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:55,860
because of one video oh no not just one

554
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:57,630
video you have no idea

555
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,400
we're not starting with you hon t I

556
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:01,920

00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:15,639
I can give you better parts you can be

561
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:17,470
the star of the entire show you see I

562
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:20,080
thought about that but why would I want

563
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:23,500
to be a part of schizo when it's a dying

564
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,240
show I'll just start my own show I mean

565
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,649
I already pretty much wrote this entire

566
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,299
episode what do you mean

567
00:25:26,649 --> 00:25:30,940
everything that happened tonight played

568
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:32,710
out exactly as I planned one might even

569
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:34,570
question the script because of how

570
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:35,590
perfect it all played out I mean it

571
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,730
might have worked out for you but

572
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:38,649
there's no way you could have planned

573
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:39,940
everything like what about when Ray died

574
00:25:38,649 --> 00:25:42,669
you couldn't have planned to have a

575
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:44,289
blackout there wasn't any black guy was

576
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:48,399
there why do you think I stood where I

577
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:50,110
did when I entered the room you stood

578
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:52,029
right by the light switch and in the

579
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:53,590
same path that Ray had to walk through

580
00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:55,570
in order to bring the ice trays which I

581
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:57,970
had already attached the note to it's

582
00:25:55,570 --> 00:26:00,010
funny I gave you all every single chance

583
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:01,570
to guess that it was me all along what

584
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:03,490
do you mean I was the one who brought

585
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:05,289
the coke that had the very first clue

586
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:07,360
remember I was the one that was closest

587
00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:09,340
to Ray when we found him dead I was even

588
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,049
the last one to mysteriously show up

589
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:13,539
from behind the counter yet none of you

590
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:15,159
suspected poor harmless Holliday because

591
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:16,539
I'm nothing more than a punchline to all

592
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:18,309
of you okay what about when Steve got

593
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:19,990
shot even if it did come from the hole

594
00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:21,519
in the wall we were on the complete

595
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:25,600
other side of the house you were with me

596
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:29,110
but it was I yes you were right when I

597
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,700
went to the closet you you were bi you

598
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:32,380
see over the years I've been collecting

599
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,090
some of your favorite possessions

600
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,440
remember all those things that went

601
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:37,269
missing in that one episode we did

602
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,610
called schizo the missing things

603
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:41,649
wait no we've never uploaded an episode

604
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:43,510
like that exactly because just like

605
00:26:41,649 --> 00:26:47,799
everything else that you were distracted

606
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:49,149
by in that closet it went missing that

607
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:50,889
still makes no sense this whole

608
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:52,779
explanation makes no sense you know what

609
00:26:50,889 --> 00:26:55,120
else doesn't make sense I already caught

610
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:57,610
this gun once to shut you up but I'll do

611
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,980
it again if I have to okay okay just go

612
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:01,690
ahead as I was saying while you were

613
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,490
distracted by some of your favorite

614
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:05,350
possession I waited for Steve to get

615
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:07,360
into position where I had already made a

616
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:09,730
whole pointing exactly where he would be

617
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,620
standing okay I mean I don't mean to

618
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:12,610
offend but how did you know that Steve

619
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,320
was gonna read the note

620
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:17,830
Regina read the note because I wrote the

621
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:20,590
word read on that no remember Oh read

622
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:22,059
that's what that's sad what I saw then

623
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:24,010
no way before Steve different I thought

624
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:27,280
it said read as him it was already read

625
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:29,350
so why would I read it again you're an

626
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,690
evil genius I know alright fine what

627
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:33,280
about the coke and mentos thing hmm yeah

628
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:35,950
you could have easily killed yourself Oh

629
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,630
see he planned that too let me guess you

630
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:39,070
froze the Mentos in the ice tray knowing

631
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,900
that by the time we got back from all

632
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:42,549
the other events if he melted so that by

633
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,960
the time he poured the coke it instantly

634
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:46,450
spilled everywhere next to the wires

635
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,650
that he previously cut but no you didn't

636
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:49,240
spill the coke on yourself

637
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:50,799
you spilled it exactly next to use a

638
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,120
puddle would form and it would look as

639
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,980
if someone else tried to kill you said

640
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,150
you'd be the last person we suspect to

641
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,530
leave the next clue in the electric

642
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,640
puddle knowing that only Regina would be

643
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:59,140
dumb enough to reach into that puddle

644
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,429
causing them the jumbo didn't save her

645
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:02,290
Gina taking her life in the process

646
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:03,910
actually that's the one thing I got

647
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:05,679
lucky on what do you mean I kind of

648
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,820
forgot that I set that trap up good

649
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,620
thing I wasn't standing in that puddle

650
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:10,120
right but what if none of us wanted coke

651
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,200
because it was diet well you had to

652
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,910
drink something right

653
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,650
why else would I bring silver crackers

654
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:16,929
and it's true alright that's enough of

655
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:18,730
this explanation long story short I set

656
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:21,520
everything up and now you're all here

657
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:24,549
ready to die why are you doing this on a

658
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,710
tear are you serious I just answered

659
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:30,250
that in the beginning oh well then at

660
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:32,380
least tell us how you did it I'm gonna

661
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,580
enjoy killing you the most I think see I

662
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,530
knew he liked me the most

663
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:38,140
but now that I've unnecessarily

664
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:40,299
explained my entire plan it's time to

665
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,710
put this to an end please honey think

666
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:43,510
you already made your point you don't

667
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:44,980
have to do this yeah plus we're the main

668
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:46,630
cast the other guys could die but if we

669
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:48,780
die there's gonna be no more skits off

670
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:52,410
perhaps that's exactly what I wanted

671
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:55,800
say goodbye to skittles forever and say

672
00:28:52,410 --> 00:29:12,030
hello to the one and only hotter taste

673
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:22,590
show what the better luck next time

674
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:25,170
buddy has finally come to an end

675
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:25,890

676
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:27,890
temper

677
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:30,600
no more Regina and her complete

678
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:33,960
non-existent intelligence no more Ryan

679
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:37,410
and his wealth is boring realistic joke

680
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:39,960
setups and storytelling and of course no

681
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:42,030
more Han attained quite possibly the

682
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:46,530
most random and beloved character of all

683
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:50,520

691
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:12,440

00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:12,440
still had I wait so thelma's a girl
