2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,009
last week if you follow my newly made

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,750
snapchat you know that I was in Hawaii

4
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:08,670
for a wedding and no I'm not saying that

5
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,440
just to plug my snapchat I hate it when

6
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:19,439
people are constantly promoting their

7
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:20,939
own real line so yeah I was in Hawaii

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,320
for a wedding I know why I'm so dark

9
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:23,880

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,750

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,670
gonna be talking to you guys about

12
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,109
having to break bad news to people it's

13
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,220
literally one of the hardest things that

14
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:30,330
you have to do in life yet it's

15
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,769
something that we all have to do I

16
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,600
honestly think it's harder to deliver

17
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:34,920
bad news to someone than it is to

18
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,450
actually receive it and if you've been

19
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,860
in that situation you know exactly what

20
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,420
I'm talking about a king bad news to

21
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,950
people just sucks it's one of the worst

22
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,899
feelings ever this is why I came up with

23
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,219
this video to not just help you myself

24
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,690
as well here's some tips and techniques

25
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,800
to make it a little easier and you guys

26
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,430
the next time you have to break bad news

27
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,809
to someone take a look first up we got

28
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,399
probably the most common technique that

29
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:55,079
people use the good news and bad news

30
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,340
technique if you have to deliver bad

31
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,660
news to people got to give them some

32
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,460
good news as well to cheer moms no

33
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,600
matter how bad the bad news is there's

34
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,030
always good news

35
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,750
you just have to find it I got some good

36
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,369
news and bad news

37
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,200
what do in here first give me the bad

38
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:09,360
news well you know how I just left to go

39
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,850
get us lattes from Starbucks yeah whoa

40
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,100
in the parking lot I kinda hit a kid

41
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,049
what are you serious and I fled the

42
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,250
scene but they definitely have your

43
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,500
license plate on file and they're

44
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,729
probably on the way here now kidding me

45
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,830
right now they're still good news so

46
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:24,479
could there possibly be any good news I

47
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,030
got the lattes Oh

48
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,610
oh yeah that's right they spilled when I

49
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,840
hit that kid the bigger picture now

50
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,490
there's different levels of bad news

51
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,630
obviously some are worse than others for

52
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,520
this technique all you have to do is

53
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,740
give fake terrible news right before you

54
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,950
give the actual bad news so I comparison

55
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,520
the actual bad news is not that bad hey

56
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,020
G yeah they're not making a frozen - oh

57
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,450
that's X and also I kind of ran over

58
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,360
your dog on the way here what oh wait

59
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:54,540
before you get mad they are making a

60
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,399
frozen to it are still dead though the

61
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,140
cliched technique one of the worst ways

62
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,939
you can break bad news to someone is by

63
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,049
just surprising them with this technique

64
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,520
you're gonna give them a warning that

65
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:03,840
bad news is coming so that they can

66
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,189
mentally prepare for it all you have to

67
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,799
do is start your conversation off with a

68
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:10,259
very cliche line such as yeah there's a

69
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,560
there's no easy way to say this

70
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:14,579
I do it to Billie and do with the boot

71
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,349
indubitably

72
00:02:14,579 --> 00:02:18,959
in dub it - what does that work

73
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:21,150
indubitably yeah that it means I you

74
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,379
know to be without a doubt or for sure I

75
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,489
know what it means boo why are you

76
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,599
trying to say oh because your

77
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:27,769
girlfriend's cheating on you

78
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:29,909
what are you sure indubitably it duped

79
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:31,709
and there really is no easy way to say

80
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:33,540
that word the good news bad news and

81
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:35,190
even worse news technique sometimes when

82
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,720
you have really really bad news you

83
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,829
don't want to overwhelm the person so

84
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,390
you're gonna want to break it up into

85
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:40,620
pieces with this technique you give it

86
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,599
to them in part so instead of giving

87
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,000
them extremely awful news you just give

88
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,409
them bad news and even worse news like

89
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,640
we mentioned earlier it doesn't hurt to

90
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:49,079
sprinkle little good news in there

91
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,440
wasn't a sprinkle I don't know what that

92
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:54,659
was so I have some good news some bad

93
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,060
news and some even worse news I wish I'd

94
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:59,400
ear first the good news I guess it the

95
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,609
good news is that your son is still

96
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,170
alive so oh my god still alive what

97
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:05,670
happened well that's the bad news do you

98
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,200
want to know that now or I thought you

99
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:09,239
wanted a good reason right tell me what

100
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,220
happened okay well the bad news is your

101
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,019
son has been hit by a car in the

102
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,609
Starbucks parking lot why didn't you

103
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:16,290
tell me that immediately well you asked

104
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:17,940
for the good news first not the bad

105
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,949
thing he's still alive without even

106
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,910
knowing isn't good news you have even

107
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,260
heard the even worse news

108
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,150
how could it be worse well the even

109
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,459
worse news is that I lied about the good

110
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,930
news huh he's dead just have fun with it

111
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:29,190
now if you still can't figure out how to

112
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,569
use these techniques I made it even

113
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,859
easier asked a bunch of you on Twitter

114
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:33,419
for some of the worst news that you ever

115
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:34,919
had to break and judging by those tweets

116
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:36,299
I came up with some of the most common

117
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:37,980
situations that people find themselves

118
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,419
in when they have to break bad news here

119
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,410
are some pre-made examples that you guys

120
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,750
can use when you're in that situation

121
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:45,030
like when grandmas tests come in she got

122
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:48,389
your grandmother's test results back and

123
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:50,819
well she passed so she's going to be

124
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:54,660
okay no but you just said she passed and

125
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:57,750
she got an 8 8 plus wait a

126
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,490
which passed away the worst news you

127
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,770
could possibly break in a wedding and

128
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:03,660
you Dana do you take Gregory to be your

129
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:06,420
husband again and by the power invested

130
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:09,570
in me I now pronounce you man and wife

131
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,520
let me now kiss the bride wait I have

132
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:16,130
something to say I have terrible news

133
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,130
there's no easy way to say this so Oh

134
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:26,220
the Wi-Fi is down when she refuses to

135
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:28,290
give starwars a chance what are you

136
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,880
doing you know how I love Star Wars and

137
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,900
I believe in the force yes and ever

138
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,760
since we've been married I've been

139
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,440
trying to get you to finally watch it so

140
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:42,440
not going to right which is why I

141
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:42,440
believe this belongs to you what is that

142
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,270
what may divorce be with you you get her

143
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,970
to break the bad news for you can't just

144
00:04:51,270 --> 00:05:00,690
do the same move over and over it's open

145
00:04:53,970 --> 00:05:03,560
Hey I really am though when it's the

146
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,560
highlight of his day

147
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:15,770
the park is closed today when you're the

148
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:18,170
boss

149
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:19,730
sir what are you doing I'm gonna light

150
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:23,630
this ring around you on fire

151
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:25,520
why cuz I'm firing you what okay

152
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,690
obviously these are jokes I took it a

153
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,980
little too far you're not gonna light

154
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,780
someone on fire this video actually

155
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,490
started off kind of realistic and then I

156
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,380
had too much fun with it sorry guys but

157
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,000
anyways truth is there is no easy way to

158
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,530
break bad news to some best way you can

159
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,790
do it is by just getting straight to the

160
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:39,080
point don't beat around the bush it's

161
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,910
like ripping off a band-aid you just do

162
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,560
it one time really fast you get it over

163
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:44,390
with you also hope that you're not hairy

164
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,950
because that hurts marks look I have to

165
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,600
get back to work in ten minutes what is

166
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:49,630
it it'd be quicker I promise okay well

167
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,340
then what's up so I have some bad news

168
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:55,370
what is that your newspaper you got wet

169
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,230
outside so it's pretty bad news now I'm

170
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,330
scared for you for a second I thought it

171
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:02,350
you really meant that means well to be

172
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:04,610
honest I actually do have more bad news

173
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:06,520
from your neighbors lawns I don't know

174
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,870
do you want to give this to them or okay

175
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,030
now listen there is something I need to

176
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,220
tell you and it's it's pretty upsetting

177
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:15,380
I'm betting what is it I just told you

178
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,880
it's up sitting there kind of slouching

179
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,710
you really should sit up cuz your back

180
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,440
it's not good for your back you know

181
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:23,480
okay but anyway the real reason why I

182
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,850
