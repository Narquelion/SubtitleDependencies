00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
hey guys so I was at the gym playing

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,859
basketball not very long ago that was

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,480
pretty much inspired to make this video

4
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:07,890
I witnessed two grown men almost get

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,330
into a fistfight over who got to play

6
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,070
the next game and that was actually

7
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,389
gonna do a cutaway reenact me exactly

8
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,099
what happened then but I feel like this

9
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:16,379
next cutaway shows it even better get

10
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,420

[Music]

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,579
that's pretty much exactly what happened

15
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,809
when men actually that immature has got

16
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,719
to be one of the most annoying things

17
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:41,790
ever that's why from now on looking at

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:43,230
the new and improved mature Orion that

19
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,309
was supposed to be the transition you

20
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,309
know going into the next

21
00:00:52,020 --> 00:01:04,049
[Music]

22
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:07,140
ya know this jacket is way too hot to

23
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:09,570
film inside shut up

24
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,100
anyway as I was saying grown immature

25
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,360
men are one of the most annoying things

26
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,619
ever don't get me wrong there's immature

27
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,210
girls as well but everyone knows that

28
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,580
it's a scientifical fact that women

29
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,140
mature faster than guys I think I mean

30
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,729
take Justin Timberlake for example he's

31
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,259
trying to look more mature and and

32
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:23,670
trying to be more grown-up by doing this

33
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,110
whole suit-and-tie thing what about

34
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,520
Justin Bieber he's trying to change his

35
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,229
image as well no longer known as that

36
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,759
innocent teenybopper star anymore I mean

37
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:31,649
he used to be just didn't even and now

38
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,450
he's like Justin Bieber now that works

39
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:35,640
out and gets tattoos and gets caught

40
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,649
with drugs and and post pictures of

41
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,500
himself half-naked on Instagram I like

42
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:42,030
them and seeing all these changes happen

43
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,819
you know I want to be cool too I can

44
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,350
mature I can grow up I can have the name

45
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:48,479
Justin so for all of you guys I want to

46
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,429
be more mature like me gives mature

47
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,630
sounds like manure oh here's some things

48
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:55,590
that I learned want maturing myself up

49
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,209
let's start with the whole reason I

50
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,429
started this video fighting

51
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:00,539
see immature guys always want to fight

52
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:01,709
over everything whether it's because

53
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:03,360
they can't control the anger or the

54
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:04,049
charm Poupon tough they are it's just

55
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,570
really immature

56
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:08,130
see I can pitch a price like 45 I mean I

57
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,179
can only bench friends like to plays but

58
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,570

now take that same situation but with

63
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:21,120
mature guy it's probably handled that

64
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,500
situation in a much more civilized

65
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,120

that I'm immature then I'm the kind of

147
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:38,789
immature guy that would watch cartoons

148
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:49,960
just like bullies get a life grow up

149
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:51,550
read a book the number one way to spot

150
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,690
an immature person about what they find

151
00:05:51,550 --> 00:06:05,080
fun if you want to be mature

152
00:05:52,690 --> 00:06:15,159
you must never again make any Bartos sex

153
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:19,509
jokes fat jokes

154
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:25,150
your mom your mama's so fat that when

155
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:29,070
she sat in the chair it broke bro and of

156
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:29,070
course the most immature penis jokes

157
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,030
[Applause]

158
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:41,170
obviously I exaggerated all these

159
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,370
example but you know what I'm trying to

160
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,440
say at some point in time all you

161
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,300
immature guys out there need to go I'm a

162
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,100
guy too so I understand how fun video

163
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,720
games are and how funny penis jokes in

164
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,100
and fart jokes can but the fact of the

165
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,350
matter is and the real reason I made

166
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,630
this video is because I'm getting older

167
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:57,550
and I'm tired of being called immature

168
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:59,920
in real life so if you're looking for

169
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:02,410
any more cheap laughs or or immature

170
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:10,870
comedy I suggest you look somewhere else

171
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:13,320
oh yeah I'm thinking about starting a

172
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,320
gaming channel
