1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,449
you know that you have a really big

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,859
pimple when you're like autofocus and

3
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:07,140
you can still see it

4
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:08,280
gross hey guys sorry I haven't posted a

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,630
video in the past couple weeks we were

6
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,790
on such a good spree and then you know

7
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,799
we're posting every single week for like

8
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,730
a month and a half and then I um did

9
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,320
what I always do

10
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,820
and I ruined it because I wrote

11
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,410
something that I knew was gonna take a

12
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,060
long time to make it's been about three

13
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,650
weeks and it's getting pretty close but

14
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,600
it's still not done hopefully it'll be

15
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,039
worth all that time probably not and I

16
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,359
don't want to spoil it or I don't want

17
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,070
to give away too much but just to get

18
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,900
you guys excited and because I made you

19
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,590
guys wait so long here is a tiny preview

20
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,270
of what's to come next week pretty

21
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,559
exciting right fine I'll give you guys a

22
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,730
real preview at the end of the video but

23
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,320
we'll get to that later back to this

24
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,600
video as most of you probably already

25
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,309
know I tend to make a lot of puns

26
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,289
I know I know most people don't like

27
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:47,760
puns they say it's like the easiest joke

28
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:49,770
to make and it's the lowest form of

29
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,090
comedy and honestly sometimes I feel

30
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,469
like I don't even have a choice I didn't

31
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,300
train myself this way I've always been

32
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,480
like this seriously I can't help it like

33
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,520
literally see like this is a perfect

34
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,140
example of a bad one because that's not

35
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,270
even a good pun for literally it's not

36
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:09,420
even lit Oh guess it just needed to be

37
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,400
lit orally that's the face you were just

38
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,600
making right yeah I get that a lot but

39
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,740
hey it could have been worse you know at

40
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,720
least I'm not one of those people who

41
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,490
makes puns out of the word pie I mean

42
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,850
those by far are the least funny puns

43
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:24,689
funny ones funny fun what hate when that

44
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:26,100
happens that's the other face that I get

45
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:27,659
a lot but in all seriousness guys I'm

46
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,979
not even joking when I say I can't help

47
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,810
but think of funds I think of a lot of

48
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:32,460
people are very similar to me like think

49
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,720
we can't help it it just it just happens

50
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,100
and that's not a good thing gets very

51
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,210
distracting actually like I'll be

52
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,470
talking to someone and they'll say

53
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,150
something that triggers me to think

54
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,530
about a pun of what they just said and

55
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,360
then I don't hear what they said because

56
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,920
I was trying to think of the fun and a

57
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,990
lot of people like to call it a DD or

58
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,399
attention deficit disorder but I think

59
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,110
that is inaccurate because it's not a

60
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,659
lack of attention a so called

61
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,640
a DV or ADHD people we are paying

62
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,810
attention but to everything that's all

63
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,909
it is I'm paying attention to everything

64
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:03,840
specifically to puns we're just people

65
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:05,100
paying attention to puns PPAP yep I

66
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,350
think that's the only thing that's more

67
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,800
upsetting than a bad pun old overused

68
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,400
memes that aren't relevant anymore how

69
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,780
about that

70
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,590
this videos like a test to see how long

71
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,300
you can endure

72
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,950
horrible things that are being done to

73
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,390
you sure half the people clicked away by

74
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,860
now but for those of you that are still

75
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,989
here I thought of a fun little challenge

76
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,849
that well to me it's fun because I like

77
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:25,500
punch or call me immature I don't care

78
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:30,750
what people say I personally still

79
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:32,580
believe that puns are comic coal I mean

80
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,200
obviously I don't love all of them some

81
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,629
are better than others send me for

82
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:40,410
example to me I find liza Koshi to be

83
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:42,180
well is that Hillary Clinton yep

84
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,890
why did you photoshop Liza's face on her

85
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:50,459
blood cuz I think she's Hillary yes

86
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:52,860
I hate we are never gonna get to the

87
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:56,549
actual challenge unless that challenge

88
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,690
has already begun no it hasn't the

89
00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:59,579
challenge is as simple as the name

90
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,110
sounds the pun challenge it's all about

91
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:03,299
making pie the twist is that instead of

92
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,829
just hand picking easy convenient words

93
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:06,959
to make your puns work you have to use a

94
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:08,400
random word generator and try your best

95
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,910
to make any of those work in any way

96
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,319
possible

97
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,569
I know that sounds really simple and

98
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,340
easy but trust me you can make this as

99
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:17,910
difficult or as easy as you want it to

100
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,650
be so this is the random word generator

101
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,569
which if all you have to do is Google

102
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,769
random word generator and one of them

103
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:24,750
will pop up there's like a bunch of them

104
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:26,340
right now it's set to one word so it'll

105
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,019
make one word at a time but you can

106
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,329
change that if you want to make it more

107
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:34,980
difficult for yourself I said it's easy

108
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:37,620
or difficult as you want to make it what

109
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:40,200
is the wheelchair superhero do to get

110
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,389
places key roles do you think Derek

111
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,650
doesn't put on sunscreen in the Sun why

112
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,650
it's just how he rolls

113
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:51,900

134
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:16,070

breathe in oxygen and it turns into

159
00:06:52,789 --> 00:07:01,820
carbon monoxide so it turns into carbon

160
00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:03,440
dioxide yes sometimes it does I cannot

161
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:11,419

you know son two things you want to

166
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:34,009
always look for in a girl number one her

167
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:36,050
fragrance and number two the white ship

168
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:40,370
puts carrots up her nose

169
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:42,680
why you're probably not the best

170
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,000
examples but um you guys get the point

171
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,080
and like most challenges I'm supposed to

172
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,360
call out a bunch of people to do this

173
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,099
but I actually thought it'd be better to

174
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,180
ask you guys I tweeted it out and said

175
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:51,949
who are some of the best people when

176
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,960
making puns and these are the common

177
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:55,310
names that popped up but like I said

178
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,110
everyone's invited not just big

179
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,610
youtubers I just want to see more puns

180
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,810
it's a dying art and I want to bring it

181
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,250
back and it's easy to do you don't have

182
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,630
to make it into a skit like oh I did

183
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,680
there's no rules just have fun with it

184
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,509
and that's what this challenge is really

185
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,220
all about celebrating puns and getting

186
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:07,940
rid of the negative stigma around them

187
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,770
because like I'm

188
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,440
and earlier some people we can't help if

189
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:16,430
PPAP is a real serious disorder that I

190
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:18,440
made up it affects everyone in the world

191
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,390
that's the real reason why we're all

192
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,880
here not just to bring BiPAP awareness

193
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:25,130
but to finally bring an end to punch Amy

194
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,720
just because most people happen to hate

195
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,760
puns doesn't mean that you need to

196
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,830
accompany them in punishing those who

197
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,080
make them beep understanding have an

198
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:35,300
open mind don't be late to the movement

199
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,530
be punctual every single part of you can

200
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,210
make a difference it doesn't matter

201
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:40,460
where you are whether you're famous like

202
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:42,800
Stefan curry on elevate Cruz Kim

203
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:44,450
Kardashian lil pun or just a normal

204
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,150
person riding in your average suburban

205
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:49,610
being driven by a man in a turban to the

206
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:51,320
local 7-eleven every pun is encouraged

207
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,690
to join the fight to end this epidemic

208
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,760
once and for all because we all know

209
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:59,350
it's better to fight with word puns and

210
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,350
web pounce and that all depends
