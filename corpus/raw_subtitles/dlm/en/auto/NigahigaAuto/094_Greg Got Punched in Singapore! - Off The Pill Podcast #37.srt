1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,150

2
00:00:03,049 --> 00:00:07,649
weddings are for me I always see life as

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,110
like something that you can look back on

4
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:11,790
and remember and those you're only gonna

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,059

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:24,480

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,969

23
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:02,370

25
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,350

26
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:10,369

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,900
I know it's doing very well well not in

31
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:20,700
those like those places that are they're

32
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,060
out of stock is where I have the most

33
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,560
feds so like it really sucks anyway if

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,290
it's not there just go to our site ninja

35
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,150
muqaam but uh yeah it sucks that they

36
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,530
were out of stock because Walmart bought

37
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,439
a whole bunch for me so we're like

38
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,600
running a little anyway we made a second

39
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,799
batch so that's our sponsor for today's

40
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,700
podcast because we don't have a sponsor

41
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,110
yeah but you can be the next one yep

42
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,189
what were you saying we're just talking

43
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,350
about like what's going on with our

44
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:48,780
lives and stuff well you just did

45
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:54,500
something with JK news for people who

46
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:57,180
don't know Bart and Joe originally yes

47
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,979
right yet they were just kidding films

48
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,630
just them too and then they transitioned

49
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,060
and they made like multiple channels

50
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:05,790
just getting party everything a podcast

51
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,320
yeah it's it's kind of like a podcast in

52
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,819
a way it's like twelve minutes of news

53
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,349
but it's not necessarily focused around

54
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:11,819
the news it's just like then just

55
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,260
discussing it and then sometimes stories

56
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,040
will pop out it was a really fun

57
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,769
experience with them

58
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,280
it's basically us except they have their

59
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:21,500
like prepared yeah and their more vulgar

60
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,239
their little more they're a lot more uh

61
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,489
they're not afraid to say things whereas

62
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,079
sometimes Ryan will be like probably

63
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:30,569
shouldn't dip my toes into that water

64
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:32,459
yeah I need to work on that I feel like

65
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:34,769
Jo and Bart are people that should be on

66
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:37,560
the podcast soon they want you oh yeah

67
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:39,450
oh you mean on ours yeah yeah on ours

68
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,859
but they also want you on theirs but

69
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,650
you're not gonna be as good as me that's

70
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:46,799
how I was out I mean I don't think I am

71
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,209
good at that that's why I brought you on

72
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:50,549
this in the first place

73
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,720
because you're just a talker you know I

74
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:53,459
mean like I had one of the reason I

75
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,129
started doing this podcast is because I

76
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,780
wanted to get better at doing this well

77
00:02:56,129 --> 00:03:00,120
you've improved over these bascomb

78
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,769
yeah I thought so too yeah well you know

79
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,810
because one of my biggest fears if you

80
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:06,060
go back and watch like back from like

81
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,700
2000 actually has early 2000 when I

82
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,370
started doing this and then like not not

83
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,500
the podcast like YouTube in general

84
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:16,590
every single interview I do I'm hella

85
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,180
awkward and I just hate doing I mean I

86
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,870
hate public speaking and I hate just

87
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,510
doing things

88
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,669
um that's live I guess and being

89
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:27,690
recorded that I don't have control over

90
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:29,129
because I I just my biggest thing is I

91
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,870
lose track of my train of thought

92
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:33,930
mm-hmm I even like when I take adderall

93
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:36,269
I like I don't have any

94
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,609
I still get those moments of just like

95
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:40,260
my mind wanders if someone's talking and

96
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:42,389
I'm not like super excited about it I

97
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,760
don't try to like I really try to pay

98
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,900
attention but I can't anyway that's

99
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,609
that's one of the reasons why I want to

100
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:52,260
do this because we are just uh you know

101
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:53,970
trying to get better at our week you

102
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,790
guys have been getting better it's

103
00:03:53,970 --> 00:04:00,780
definitely something that I've been

104
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:02,730
trying to the same way then listen to as

105
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,010
much as I can for you guys like you know

106
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,440
all the podcasts I don't listen to it

107
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:12,329
that much but every time I do did you

108
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:13,829
listen to us yeah I do I know when he

109
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:15,659
does I mean it's like it's like a lot of

110
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:18,419
people it's like select yeah this is a

111
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:21,120
oh I guess you care about or the the

112
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:23,719
good window I really like the one that

113
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,900
you guys it with though with the Chang

114
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:32,760
qu yang Oh

115
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:34,949
Oh change yo whoops yeah the window with

116
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:39,840
yang was up you clearly paid attention

117
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:42,419
during that one yeah that was a good one

118
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,790
like I learned a lot from them and I

119
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:47,729
think for me the reason why I mean I

120
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:49,470
liked it is because I literally was like

121
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:50,669
those are my real questions that I

122
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,500
always asked it you don't get to

123
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:53,400
normally have those things answered from

124
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,139
someone you know right you don't have

125
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,540
the opportunity to have that person

126
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:59,850
there yeah he definitely dropped a lot

127
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,770
of information on us that was kind of

128
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:03,270
like I mean it is gonna be a little

129
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,250
biased because it is coming from you

130
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,470
know his campaign his perspective stuff

131
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,360
like that but nonetheless I mean what

132
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:12,060
you see also in the news is kind of

133
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,960
reflecting what he talks about I don't

134
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,210
know if you guys saw though but they

135
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,600
were talking about in terms of who's

136
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:20,010
raising the most money he actually

137
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,600
raised like a decent amount but even

138
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,460
then news networks are not putting his

139
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,960
like he's raising more than some people

140
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,180
on those news networks and they're not

141
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,530
showing him like that so that's

142
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,870
interesting there's I mean that's been

143
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:32,910
like the narrative from like months ago

144
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,919
right like he's coming out of nowhere

145
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,820
and they keep there's all these like

146
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,440
there's like it's not really a

147
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,870
conspiracy cuz it's actually happening

148
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,669
like there's so many things

149
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:43,320
coincidentally that that goes against

150
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:46,590
the mainstream media is doing against

151
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,240
Andrew yang so for whatever reason he's

152
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:51,210
being targeted I think to a certain

153
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,889
degree and I guess if you just look it

154
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:54,599
up you can you can see like people have

155
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:58,139
made videos of him like proof race it's

156
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:59,160
happening and I'm not sure why and maybe

157
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,320
it could be because he's the only one

158
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,280
that's not a politician could be that

159
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,840
crazy

160
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,660
yeah same way of that I guess in the

161
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,060
same way he's kind of like Donald Trump

162
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,919
should I say that like but the way like

163
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,080
he's not a politician it just came in

164
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:14,460
here and took people by storm maybe

165
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,860
they're afraid that he'll he'll actually

166
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,930
what if that's the route though for like

167
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,970
the next presidency is like someone who

168
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:24,120
isn't a politician who isn't playing by

169
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:25,320
those rules I think was formed I think

170
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,849
that's true like I think that's why

171
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,340
they're trying to not show him because

172
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:31,349
they want they want somebody who's that

173
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,750
they're used to in there that will be

174
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,740
conformed will conform to lobbyists and

175
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,620
stuff like that mm-hmm

176
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,990
or it's just because he's Asian could be

177
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,400
ya know I mean you know they're making

178
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:44,070
big jumps but he's

179
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,199
that's a big too big of a jump yes maybe

180
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:48,710
maybe the reason to not stir away too

181
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:51,000
far but still talking about you know

182
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:53,130
presidential politics and opinions on

183
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,960
things something that recently popped up

184
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:59,190
that Ryan and I both picked as a good

185
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,500
topic was the Obama vs. woke culture

186
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:03,449
exchange I was shocked

187
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:07,050
yes all that video you want to explain

188
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:09,000
why Amin well I'll take that back I

189
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:11,520
wasn't shocked I was just shocked that

190
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,470
they that he said that publicly so

191
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,979
basically Obama there's a video of him

192
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:19,080
was he at a Q&A or something it was

193
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:20,550
Chicago yeah doing he was doing a speech

194
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,440
I think it was for something for him let

195
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,820
me look it up as you talk uh-huh so he

196
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,810
was giving some speech or whatever I

197
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,580
would just watch the video I didn't see

198
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:30,300
the full whatever thing he was doing any

199
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:33,030
kind of like went out against like

200
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,130
cancer culture sorry woke Obama dude

201
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:37,560
yeah not really not really against it he

202
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:41,099
just showed he gave a different opinion

203
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:44,910
um from what you're used to seeing from

204
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:48,060
one side like from the Left Party which

205
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:51,720
is like they're usually very Pro being

206
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:53,430
woke and and being you know canceling

207
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,680
people who have done the wrong things in

208
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:57,630
the past and he was basically not saying

209
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,460
he wasn't going against it completely

210
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:01,260
but he kind of gave his opinion and he

211
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,060
said we can't everybody makes mistakes

212
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:05,789
the exact argument that a lot of people

213
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,229
make when they mess up it was coming

214
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:10,169
from him though so it was like very

215
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:11,820
strange because he's cancelled for

216
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:13,590
something that's what I'm there

217
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,389
something like what's coming up that

218
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:17,880
someone has dirt on him for or like

219
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:19,560
nothing that I've seen so far on the

220
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,139
news but basically he was speaking at an

221
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:25,080
Obama Foundation summit in Chicago on

222
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:27,990
Tuesday where he spoke out and asked for

223
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:31,830
Americans to like abandon ideologically

224
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:34,320
pure ideal ideological purity test set

225
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:36,419
his quote in politics no it's a this is

226
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,900
an article that's quoting him but his

227
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:42,120
quote was that this idea of purity and

228
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,860
you're never compromised and you're

229
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,420
always politically woke and all that

230
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,510
stuff you should get over that quickly

231
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:51,690
he said the world is messy there are

232
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:54,660
ambiguities people who do really good

233
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:55,380
stuff have flaws yeah and that's so true

234
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,350
like

235
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:01,650
but now coming from Obama that's and

236
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:02,880
he's again it's always been like you

237
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,280
know I mean you hear people on the right

238
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,290
and they're also saying things contrary

239
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,330
to that but it's almost like they go so

240
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:11,340
far and above it's like it became this

241
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,870
like extreme vers extreme yeah that's

242
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,090
someone who's finally like kind of in

243
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,950
the middle yeah you know it's like and I

244
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:19,230
feel like a lot of times - a lot of

245
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:21,540
people who do speak out are the

246
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:23,790
extremists where most of America

247
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:26,130
probably sits somewhere in central you

248
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:28,890
know like they'll lean to a side but

249
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:30,720
because it's so extremists on both sides

250
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,010
you're afraid of like oh if I speak out

251
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,660
and be like well the other side does

252
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:36,540
have good points like what about this

253
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,920
then your own side will be like oh

254
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,240
you're betraying this you know you don't

255
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,950
truly believe us you should just be with

256
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:46,530
them and right it's so polarizing you

257
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:48,690
know I thought it was just great cuz

258
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:50,430
like we got even like we talked about it

259
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,230
a little bit too much I think here and

260
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,700
we're talking about it again about like

261
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,710
cancer culture and how much I hate it

262
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,380
even with the last August with Tim I was

263
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:00,240
talking about like he was like I can

264
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,610
understand it like he was trying but I

265
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,490
was like I don't I'm pissed and I don't

266
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:08,490
like it but just even having saying that

267
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:12,990
there's negativity towards me and saying

268
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:15,030
why why that it's necessary to that that

269
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:16,170
happens you know that people do get

270
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:19,320
counsel for doing these things because

271
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:22,640
it's a necessary sacrifice for the good

272
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:25,200
of humanity and I think the initial

273
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,670
cortical cancellations were important

274
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,930
you know like Harvey Weinstein like

275
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:30,510
people who have been doing terrible

276
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:32,490
stuff for a long time and then it got to

277
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:35,070
the point where this monster just grew

278
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:37,050
and was like fetus more fetus more and

279
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:39,270
no matter what they did they just wanted

280
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,010
sacrifices and it became its own

281
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:43,260
religion and cult in a way if you think

282
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,480
about it yeah well canceling people you

283
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:48,000
mean yeah yeah and I think that kind of

284
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,290
bread the whole and again the divide

285
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,260
happened right it kind of bread the

286
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:54,360
whole anti-cancer Asian culture so

287
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,740
canceling cancellation culture

288
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,510
we're like people were so annoyed

289
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,920
including myself not that I would do

290
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,910
that speak out I get like people who

291
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,760
deserve to be canceled should be

292
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:04,590
cancelled yeah but I think somewhere

293
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,660
along the lines we lost that you know

294
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:09,000
where do we draw that line and then

295
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:11,580
people were so annoyed by you know

296
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,790
the whole Kevin Hart situation or Dave

297
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:16,140
Chappelle's you know thing people are so

298
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,840
annoyed by it that they went to the

299
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,550
extreme like almost troll level off just

300
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,750
like canceling every but like going

301
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:24,360
against council culture in every single

302
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:26,460
way and I think that's yeah I mean I

303
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,280
don't I don't know I hate talking about

304
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:31,800
this cuz like it's just gonna draw more

305
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,230
of those same people we're gonna anyway

306
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,210

and this is something that a lot of

313
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,560
people have kind of like I don't think

315
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,960

like yeah Greg and Dana are engaged so

321
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:16,770
what happened was I was supposed to make

322
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,050
like this crazy video because I had this

323
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:25,890
thing all planned out it was super cool

324
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:29,370
in my mind but yeah my proposed oh let's

325
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:31,650
just say it was it was cute but the

326
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,240
execution was audio you said he had

327
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,850
issues right well the video was horrible

328
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,740
yeah the video is horrible but the way I

329
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:42,030
did it was like you know I was supposed

330
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:43,590
to propose to her with like like Legos

331
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:45,660
me and her are both in trillions of

332
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:49,860
Legos and I made this cool little Lego

333
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:52,500
thing and it broke when I gave it to her

334
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,690
I was trying to put it together Wow

335
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,570
stuttering and mumbling all sweating

336
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:59,190
anyway I'll make a video of it I can I

337
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,810
think and make a good video of it just

338
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:03,060
wait for that but that's honestly more

339
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:04,620
like that's like everyone sees those

340
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,089
videos where everything is like super

341
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,070
planned and romantic and like that's

342
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:10,230
like s'more you you know like that's you

343
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:12,150
guys that's like I mean I know it's

344
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:13,820
always been fun industry but like that's

345
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:16,530
like it's the epitome of your

346
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:18,210
relationship I feel like I mean from my

347
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:20,610
perspective I feel like that that's

348
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,060
almost even better that it ended up that

349
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,780
way

350
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,000
I think so instead the footage though

351
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:27,940
it's it's of you like breaking in and

352
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,680
then panicking and yeah yeah yep I think

353
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,650
that's better I don't know it's pretty

354
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,120
funny it's really cute but yeah me and

355
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:37,900

00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,960
filming it there was only like ten of us

365
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,790
right give or take

366
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,040
and that way they could just have fun

367
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:04,570
right but you're doing a little bit

368
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,930
different the tradition oi yeah my

369
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:10,360
family is give us some own family in a

370
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:13,570
way in Filipino so it's being yeah but

371
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,320
it's just my family never really had a

372
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:17,710
big wedding

373
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:20,170
in or at least in my immediate family we

374
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:23,230
recently had something smaller but we

375
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:25,180
never had like the grand scale of like

376
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,950
actual wedding yeah and I thought it

377
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,350
would just be fun to see what some of my

378
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:31,780
my auntie's and uncles dressed up I mean

379
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:38,980
they never wear anything close to like

380
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:40,600
suits and that's easy yeah something

381
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,700
different something different yeah that

382
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,530
you know it's always about for me I

383
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,750
always see life as like something that

384
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:48,130
you can look back on and remember and

385
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,320
those are your only gonna remember

386
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:52,450
certain things mm-hmm and I just want

387
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,040
like you know for my family that would

388
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,510
be a cool thing to remember when

389
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:59,170
everyone was dressed up and had like

390
00:14:55,510 --> 00:15:02,560
this actual ball or whatever kind of

391
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:04,900
like something that was from like a

392
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:08,350
fairy tale or something but it's not

393
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:10,420
gonna be that it's gonna be our version

394
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:14,710
it's gonna be a Greg and Dana wedding

395
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:15,760
like always and Dana's family is her

396
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:20,110
family is big

397
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:22,870
her family is huge she has some like I

398
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:25,240
think she herself has 100 something

399
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:27,690
people and oh my god what well of course

400
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,130
it's gonna be expensive then I mean

401
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:33,190
don't you think big does well even if it

402
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:36,180
was like cheap like yeah I mean not

403
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:38,880
cheap even if it was affordable

404
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:41,010
like if you got McDonald's for everyone

405
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,260
mm-hmm inviting that many people is just

406
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:45,120
but even like the venue like just

407
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,470
because I don't know and I'm sure Paco

408
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,510
doesn't know and a lot of people who

409
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:50,580
haven't gotten married don't know what

410
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:52,080
is like give me an average breakdown of

411
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,240
like when you're looking for venues and

412
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,740
like say you have what 200 people coming

413
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,840
right what is like what is the price

414
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:01,290
they're giving so the venue itself it

415
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,820
depends on like what you are going for

416
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:05,220
if you're going for like a wake up like

417
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,020
a big venue yeah usually they'll have

418
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,740
everything included like the food and

419
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:13,770
all that and that can get up to about

420
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:15,510
100 to 200 dollar sway a person okay so

421
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:17,070
what is like so if you were to go with

422
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:19,110
those bigger venues right 200 people

423
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:20,790
like it's like a bigger wedding I think

424
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:22,950
right but in general like what was like

425
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:27,780
the mid-range price they were quoting

426
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:29,610
you probably about mid range with drinks

427
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:34,770
and food and the venue everything

428
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:37,290
included I would say a clean hundred

429
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:43,320
dollars per person in Nevada the average

430
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:46,470
cost for weddings is 296 dollars per

431
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:48,300
person that per person okay so that's

432
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:50,250
already way more than what you're seeing

433
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,020
that's crazy that's freaking crazy

434
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,940
and you saw $100 per person is

435
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:55,590
affordable yeah that's like she's always

436
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,690
a 200 people that's 20 grand

437
00:16:55,590 --> 00:17:00,450
right yeah and that's not even including

438
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:03,510
the videographer photographer I'm just

439
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:08,310
gonna have you guys just shaking a

440
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:09,630
little bit and think about like how much

441
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,940
is the average wedding dress you know

442
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:14,520
Dana's wedding dress price like all

443
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:16,800
those things add up it's like you got to

444
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,060
be rich to get married exactly or we're

445
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,130
not rich but you got it like to have

446
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,209
like one of those like a pretty wedding

447
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,339
that you've seen in like movies and

448
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:25,940
stuff you have to be pretty wealthy and

449
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:28,800
and it's kind of crazy to me how many

450
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:30,330
how expected that is I'm not even I'm

451
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,280
not even including the ring like the

452
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,810
cost of a ring yeah and I've always

453
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,520
thought this and I know that a lot of

454
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:37,860
people will disagree including my own

455
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,690
probably my parents cuz they're married

456
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:42,060
I think weddings are like a scam I

457
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:44,700
didn't agree with that too but I thought

458
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:47,400
I thought woked oh okay explain to me

459
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:49,710
explain to me why what you what you were

460
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:53,490
told I wasn't told anything I was

461
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:55,080
okay when I was when guests come yeah

462
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,870
they usually give money as gifts

463
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,700
so I guess get back the guests are

464
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,330
paying for the experience with you

465
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,140
mm-hmm

466
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:06,779
so if you know as long as you're not

467
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:08,700
like just going ridiculous like you're

468
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:12,270
not spending a million dollars in your

469
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:14,909
wedding it's not gonna be that much of a

470
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:16,890
financial it's like an investment of a

471
00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:18,899
good time right something that you can

472
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:21,750
like experience with your family and

473
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:23,610
your loved ones right they're gonna at

474
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:28,200
some point give you something in return

475
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:30,210
and it should be kind of like a balance

476
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,980
right but in the grand scheme so you're

477
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:34,140
kind of essentially like so the way I

478
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,100
see it is you're basically I mean the

479
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,860
way you have to see is you're just

480
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,809
throwing a party for other people right

481
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:41,520
but I think like okay so you're saying

482
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:43,260
that you put in all this money in this

483
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,029
venue to that whatever you get a lot of

484
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:47,159
it back because the people coming right

485
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:48,929
not all of it but you've got a bunch of

486
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,860
money or gifts or whatever it is you get

487
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:52,470
value right

488
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,399
the only people like I get that and when

489
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:55,440
they have weddings the same thing

490
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:57,690
happens to them the only the only people

491
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,179
who are really coming up is the business

492
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:02,309
itself like wedding the wedding industry

493
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:06,450
people who sell the Rings who set who

494
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:09,059
are that you pay for the the venue and

495
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:10,140
right and so on and no those those are

496
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:11,880
the that's what I'm saying it's like

497
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:14,029
it's not I'm not the scam was a wrong

498
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:18,919
way to say it I think it's just a very

499
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:21,480
smart business that we've in society

500
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:22,860
taught people that is this is the route

501
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,049
you go it's something that you're always

502
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,610
like everyone like this is the dream I

503
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:30,510
always face is that like that's

504
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:32,880
everything know like any event you're

505
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:35,100
gonna want to celebrate it's gonna be

506
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,200
that type of model where it's gonna be

507
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,909
someone's gonna be making money off of

508
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,070
it even as small as like a Super Bowl

509
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:42,360
party right you know like some any type

510
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:45,059
of event where you're gathering people

511
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:47,549
and you're just celebrating having fun

512
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:49,260
mm-hmm I mean anytime you think about it

513
00:19:47,549 --> 00:19:51,149
you are spending you're willing to spend

514
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:53,279
money what just outfit a difference is

515
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:55,470
is like there's things in weddings that

516
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:56,909
is not your average party a getting a

517
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:59,039
dress that cost that much that you'll

518
00:19:56,909 --> 00:20:01,049
wear once to meet like logically if you

519
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,820
tell someone who doesn't who's an alien

520
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:03,580
from outer space and they're like oh you

521
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,440
so you guys can get

522
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,570
right you're gonna be together risk your

523
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,550
lies cool why do you need to pay this

524
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:11,620
amount of money for this thing that mmm

525
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:12,790
that you're gonna wear once and same

526
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,890
with the ring like it's like oh there's

527
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:16,810
diamonds in general again we're taught

528
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,100
that has so much value but I don't know

529
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,510
if this is true but I've heard so many

530
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:22,180
times that diamonds aren't actually that

531
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:24,760
rare and compared to other gems I don't

532
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:26,650
know it's diamonds are not rare yeah but

533
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,330
we've given it so much value right I

534
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:29,590
actually just looked at up cuz I I've

535
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:31,540
heard this before about I wanted to look

536
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:34,450
a little bit more you know how it it

537
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:36,970
basically talks about how it was a

538
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:42,730
marketing campaign in the nineteen for

539
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:45,160
what's-his-name Ryan no all right

540
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:46,480
I didn't see it but I know what you're

541
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,950
talking about that's exactly what the

542
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,230
myth of like diamonds you're saying yeah

543
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:53,890
weddings in general right all weddings

544
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:55,780
in general we're just back then rich

545
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:58,180
people used to get married and now it's

546
00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:00,040
like you know lower-class people wanna

547
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:02,470
do the same things that the rich people

548
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:06,790
were doing right and is also used it was

549
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:09,160
a ways of exchanging land um back in

550
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:11,020
like Europe and stuff really or it would

551
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:15,220
be like we have a treaty things like

552
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:17,440
that it was basically used as a in

553
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:19,060
agreement between two richer larger

554
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,430
families uh-huh that's what it was for

555
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:23,680
or there was like you know dowry whereas

556
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:25,750
it's like I think dowry is worth the

557
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:29,590
woman's family right has to give an

558
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:32,110
offering as well to the man and that's

559
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:34,300
just how it was before and then we

560
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:36,730
normalized it by saying hey this is like

561
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:39,340
what love is you know marriage right and

562
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:40,990
all these things and I mean that's kind

563
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:43,240
of just like what capitalism is you know

564
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:44,560
you're selling people an idea yeah and

565
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,540
if you can make them believe it you can

566
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,150
make money off yeah but what I'm saying

567
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:50,590
and I'm I think what is happening is a

568
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:53,290
lot of people are going non-traditional

569
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:54,340
yeah as I think like with anything right

570
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,590
we're not gonna do everything

571
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:58,960
necessarily our parents right right over

572
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:01,060
time you get your own you know point of

573
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,740
view but anyway I don't have any issue

574
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,960
with with it because it's still that

575
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:07,210
normal right and I in our society and I

576
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,120
have no issue following that because it

577
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:12,190
does bring happiness to people but when

578
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,920
people don't do it a specific way and

579
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:16,790
they're being judged for it yeah I think

580
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,250
that's where it's an issue I think it's

581
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:22,610
definitely an issue when you know it

582
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:24,230
doesn't become fun for the people right

583
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:27,260
and doing it yeah two main people that

584
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:30,350
are supposed to be having fun I feel

585
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:32,720
once it gets to doing traditions that

586
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:34,640
they don't even understand or you know

587
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,520
they're they're just doing it just

588
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,900
because that's when it becomes kind of

589
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,250
you know why are you even doing it

590
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,350
they're right yeah it's just like you're

591
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:44,000
just following these traditions but

592
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:45,860
that's so many people who do things to

593
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,910
please others yeah but I mean like

594
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,710
that's that's where I think it's

595
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:50,450
changing because in the past you just do

596
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:52,100
it right like our parents days like yeah

597
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,840
yeah get a nice dress get a nice place

598
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,610
make sure everyone eats well right you

599
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,690
don't worry about eating you like deta

600
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:58,190
and my parents don't even remember

601
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:00,230
eating what their meal but everyone else

602
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:01,940
did right and most times you hear this

603
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,990
only reasoning because we're at that age

604
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,760
where a lot of our friends are getting

605
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:06,530
married and stuff like that you hear so

606
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,700
many stories of like oh I'm so stressed

607
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:09,590
I gotta plan the wedding like for a

608
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,120
whole year the girl or whoever's

609
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:13,010
planning it and and it's a financial

610
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,380
burden and you know they don't have

611
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:17,120
necessarily the same money that a thirty

612
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:20,540
year old when our parents were growing

613
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,830
up might have and it's kind of like why

614
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,210
are you getting married then like I get

615
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:24,470
you go to the courthouse I get you don't

616
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,670
have the dream you're not everything we

617
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:27,290
grew up watching and movies and stuff

618
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,330
like that but like if you're so

619
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:31,040
miserable from this you know it's gonna

620
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:33,140
put a strain on your actual relationship

621
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,030
then you should just you don't need to

622
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,440
do that and also you could technically

623
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:38,690
do this you could just go to the

624
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:41,240
courthouse get married and then do the

625
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:43,220
like official wedding later cuz your

626
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,680
friends aren't ever gonna be like hey

627
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,520
this is your actual anniversary

628
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,930
hey do you remember when your

629
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,340
anniversary was yeah you don't remember

630
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:51,320
your friend's anniversaries or anything

631
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:53,420
like that so why does it matter it

632
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:56,390
doesn't matter it oh yeah that stuff is

633
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:57,860
just it's if you actually love each

634
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:00,680
other and you can't really you're not

635
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:03,230
into throwing parties and you're not

636
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,790
into you know getting your family and

637
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:07,270
friends together and that that's just

638
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:09,890
not your thing then yeah yeah weddings

639
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:11,780
it's not something you have to do and

640
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:13,640
also like going back I mean like one of

641
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:15,380
the main reasons I guess arguments for

642
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:20,090
marriage is because it's religious as

643
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:22,940
well which I mean like I get that it is

644
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:25,550
right it's a religious thing yeah

645
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,780
if other if not for that reason like

646
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:28,130
let's say you're not the most religious

647
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,020
person in the world or you don't go to

648
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,500
church every Sunday or whatever like you

649
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:34,010
know you're just

650
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:35,270
average person that sounds bad

651
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,710
not that the average person doesn't go

652
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:38,870
to church anyway I'm covering up my

653
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:42,560
council culture right now so I you know

654
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:44,990
giving myself insurance mom if for

655
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:47,450
somebody who isn't necessarily getting

656
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:49,010
married because of religion what really

657
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:50,180
change like for you yourself like you

658
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:53,900
guys aren't I don't think it was a

659
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:55,490
church what's really gonna change other

660
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,740
than like you know being able to claim

661
00:24:55,490 --> 00:25:01,880
for me you guys are a couple like

662
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:02,900
legally what changes for you how was

663
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,340
your life gonna change once you're

664
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,500
married versus not because you're

665
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:08,450
already living together yeah as far as

666
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,560
lay together I mean the we're always

667
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:12,290
gonna love each other we've been

668
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:14,120
together for so long that the main

669
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:16,580
reason we're getting married is just to

670
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:20,360
have some fun yeah like that's why I'm

671
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:22,580
really excited like I'm actually really

672
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,690
excited because I know that we're gonna

673
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,310
have this big party

674
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:27,650
don't the main thing that's gonna change

675
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:29,120
for us is basically just taxes Yeah

676
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:33,290
right that's like one of the biggest

677
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,730
benefits too right but I mean like that

678
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:36,050
that that's the thing too if you'd

679
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:39,530
really think about it other than the

680
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:43,040
incentive of you know having taxes it

681
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:44,570
doesn't it's there's not a big jump

682
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,980
anymore because people are already

683
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:48,680
living together they're already sleeping

684
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:50,000
together it's too expensive in the past

685
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,040
it was a little different right yeah

686
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,760
because it was like you don't well for

687
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,830
one you don't have sex until you're

688
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,180
married right like I'm one I'm sure

689
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,580
people didn't always follow that but it

690
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:01,250
was more of a thing yeah

691
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:02,480
also I the fact that you don't really

692
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,220
you're not supposed to live with someone

693
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,260
before you're married mmm I don't know

694
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:08,060
is that a religious thing was just like

695
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,500
temptations I don't think that's so much

696
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,270
a religious thing it's just like that

697
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,700
you're allowing yourself to be living

698
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:15,440
with temptation there any but yeah but

699
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,380
anyway that times were different right

700
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,630
way I mean marriage was it was so much

701
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:22,130
of a bigger deal it's like now it's like

702
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:23,600
people move in after being together for

703
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:25,340
a couple months right you know what that

704
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,660
would be that would be a complete you

705
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:30,170
wouldn't that's unheard of right now

706
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:31,790
parents time and I think that's it's

707
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:33,350
just where we are right now that's why

708
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,670
it's it's kind of changing yeah it's

709
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:36,440
definitely changing but I think it's

710
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:38,510
changing for the better for sure yeah

711
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:43,400
it's like you know people are realizing

712
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:44,540
that yeah like weddings aren't essential

713
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,980
like you don't have

714
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:48,470
to have a big wedding and you can do

715
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:50,420
these just kind of non-traditional

716
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:52,190
smaller weddings but you know what to

717
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,450
play the devil's advocate then cuz it

718
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:55,790
seems like we're all on the same side

719
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:58,100
mm-hmm since you mentioned that weddings

720
00:26:55,790 --> 00:27:00,230
aren't essential and it's something that

721
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:03,920
you can choose to do to display your

722
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:05,750
love what did it mean more than if you

723
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:08,450
are doing that to spend more you mean

724
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:09,770
yet to spend more grand gesture I'm

725
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:11,650
doing this is how much I love this

726
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:13,670
person and sometimes a lot of people

727
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:16,250
because they're there's different love

728
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:18,410
languages you know but who are you doing

729
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:20,060
that for because if you're both on the

730
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:22,070
same page right the girl and the guy and

731
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:23,240
they both don't care about that no but

732
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,800
see what do they do that maybe that's

733
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,230
that's what that's why if they do then

734
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,670
do it like of course like that's if you

735
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:30,740
want to make her happy and she wants

736
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:32,720
that or vice versa right then you do it

737
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,860
right if you can afford you do it

738
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,900
because you want to make your partner

739
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:38,060
happy if you both don't care about it

740
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,530
who are you doing it for mm your family

741
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:42,230
members you could do it for them but

742
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:43,970
like really then should you be really

743
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:46,970
making them happy with your wedding just

744
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:48,500
throw a party but I mean I understand

745
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:50,930
what you're saying but what I'm saying

746
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,640
is like that's good our perspective yeah

747
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:54,800
if we're trying to understand somebody

748
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,540
who is actively trying to do a wedding

749
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,280
right right you know what I mean I mean

750
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:59,780
great they're doing it right now and I

751
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,910
think like you said you guys don't

752
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:03,800
really care about it that much but it's

753
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:05,570
something you've grew up wanting right

754
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:08,750
I'm sure you did too and I'm sure Dana

755
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:11,150
of course did yeah Dana grew up wanting

756
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:14,540
one I just never it wasn't like wasn't

757
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:17,660
even a thing it was just like like

758
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:20,020
people got married courthouse is like

759
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:22,190
that's like my family tradition so

760
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,910
having like a big wedding it's kind of a

761
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:24,020
surprise

762
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:29,540
and so she didn't want to respect your

763
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:33,110
tradition I'm just kidding Wow yeah like

764
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:35,090
I think it's just yeah I could see it

765
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:36,500
just people wanting to ball out I said

766
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:38,420
when people are the clubs and they just

767
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,490
buy a thousand dollar bottles for right

768
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:42,080
you know even though it's like 30 bucks

769
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:43,700
at the store yeah exactly

770
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,710
it's just like a cool something you

771
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:47,690
don't get to do suggest your sub ah yeah

772
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:48,320
it's a good reason to do something kind

773
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:50,780
of crazy

774
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,270
we've talked a lot about weddings and it

775
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:56,570
disgusts me I've been single for so long

776
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:58,370
but that's besides the point but are we

777
00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:00,140

uh this what is crazy Gregg well I just

781
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:08,630

790
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:46,210
make people look at you different yeah

00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:51,440
even they may not marry and we're back

792
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:53,110

793
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,290
what were we talk we we were a good

794
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:57,140
story

795
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:58,940
yeah in Singapore not nobody knows it

796
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:01,220
really publicly some people know if they

797
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:06,380
live in Singapore it's or they're at the

798
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:08,900
event yeah it's very well kept yes a

799
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:10,760
very sensitive sensitive story yeah

800
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:13,040
let's let's start this off with a little

801
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:15,860
so we hop what year was this when we

802
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:18,890
went to Singapore before I was in yeah

803
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:25,309
so what years that either 14 or 15 okay

804
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:25,960
so it was me Greg will and David David

805
00:30:25,309 --> 00:30:28,970
was there

806
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:32,870
Arden was there as well there was just a

807
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:34,670
few of us yeah yeah we were doing like a

808
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:37,670
little mini like shows like we just do

809
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:41,240
more shows and stuff back then and then

810
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:42,679
we were in Singapore and I believe this

811
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,450
is before we actually did the show like

812
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:47,480
people take us out and stuff like that

813
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:50,420
we went to this club and it's at the top

814
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,200
of Marina Bay Sands which is like for

815
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,480
those of you that know ones like that

816
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,920
that ship looking thing and crazy rich

817
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,559
Asians you know the three towers yeah

818
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:59,990
has like a boat ending scene in crazy

819
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:02,179
rich Asians that their Jemma meets Harry

820
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,809
Shum Jr and then you're like do you

821
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:04,999

822
00:31:02,809 --> 00:31:07,039

824
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,970
anyway it's a very famous pitch at the

825
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,759
top of there it's called c'est la vie

826
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:17,110
I think the club we're at this club I

827
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:23,240
guess a day before performance and then

828
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:25,190
it goes down like so mind-blowing we had

829
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:28,929
a performance the next day mm-hmm he

830
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:31,639
didn't have a performance ready

831
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:34,669
two days two days from there right

832
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:35,659
that's true two days yep so we had a lot

833
00:31:34,669 --> 00:31:38,450
of work to do still

834
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:40,580

they were like standing up next to this

902
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:39,290
table two big-ass dudes like I'm talking

903
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:42,320
like bodybuilders like think think you a

904
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:44,210
mountain you know from from what's a

905
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,010
game of Thrones but like shorter so that

906
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:48,560
same with almost like Brock Lesnar's

907
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:50,510
kind of thing with not as big as Brock

908
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,220
Lesnar but like think similar build got

909
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:55,010
it same build as Brock Lesnar but

910
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:56,000
smaller okay anyway these two I guess

911
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,590
they're a different weight lifts a who

912
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,270
knows what their their weight lifters it

913
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:01,390
looked like just two dudes who look like

914
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:03,950
they could be freaking

915
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:05,450
bodybuilders anyway Greg goes up to

916
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:07,250
these guys like he has to everybody else

917
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:09,050
and I don't know what happened from

918
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:11,990
there cuz I wasn't there either

919
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:13,700
yeah well you don't remember according

920
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:14,780
to other people who did see it you're

921
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,130
just doing the same thing like trying to

922
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,410
get them to dance or something and then

923
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:21,380
I don't know what happened what were you

924
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:23,240
taught yeah like I I had no idea what

925
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:25,010
happened from there because I don't know

926
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,450
what happened well the big dude punched

927
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:30,380
you in the face that's what happened

928
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:33,260
like so we got filled

929
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:36,650
over time what happened and supposedly I

930
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:38,720
was really adamant about getting these

931
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:42,200
two guys to come up and dance with us

932
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:45,530
uh-huh and supposedly one of them was

933
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:47,030
look Polynesian and I mean I'm neither

934
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:50,660
from New Zealand right yeah I think one

935
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:52,910
of them was uh yeah and I was like hey

936
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:54,680
are you Samoan or whatever I guess I was

937
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:59,120
just trying to you know connect with him

938
00:35:54,680 --> 00:36:01,460
right here somali yeah and they were

939
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:03,140
just not having it I mean from what I

940
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,600
what we heard was that they probably

941
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:07,640
thought that we were you know like they

942
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,320
were just kind of homophobic maybe and

943
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,910
maybe they thought that we're getting

944
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,500
them to dance I was like trying to hit

945
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:15,410
on them or something and they just

946
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:19,130
weren't having it and I guess one of

947
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:23,240
them just knocked me out yeah straight

948
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:24,710
in the face and the crazy thing is again

949
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,120
I didn't see it firsthand but I'm being

950
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:27,260
told from people who did see it cuz it

951
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,000
was right next to us I just wasn't look

952
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:32,180
in that direction is that there was no

953
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,160
like like pushing like you know you know

954
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:35,930
when fights start shake happens people

955
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,640
gather and then you separate but there

956
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:40,430
was no like pushing away moment it was

957
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,930
just great was in this face I guess I'm

958
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:44,030
not like gonna degress it when they come

959
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:45,740
the school party whatever and then it's

960
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:47,240
just turn around punch straight in the

961
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:53,150
face there was like it was instantaneous

962
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:56,390
and then it was just like panic so what

963
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:59,090
happened was it was a just instant punch

964
00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:03,380
right to my face only thing I remember

965
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:06,710
was I was I was on the ground wills side

966
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:10,670
of the story was that he punched me and

967
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:13,490
then instantly he was like in regret

968
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:15,380
mode because all of the Singapore not

969
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:19,540
Singapore what club security like

970
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:22,430
surrounded him and I was on the ground

971
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:28,300
and out you guys thought I was dead

972
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:31,040
pretty much hmm I will they picked me up

973
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:34,670
and I guess there was just blood

974
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:36,680
everywhere not to be too graphic but it

975
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:41,180
was literally pouring out of my face

976
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:43,700
blood everywhere and I just got my

977
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:46,330
braces on maybe about

978
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:50,660
maybe two or three months before that

979
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:53,150
and my teeth were loose because of the

980
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:54,530
braces well that's what the doctor told

981
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:58,610
me it's loose when they're moving you

982
00:37:54,530 --> 00:38:01,250
know you guys lifted me up and I guess

983
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:04,070
two of my teeth were missing yep

984
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:05,750
the front not the front two but one of

985
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:09,920
the front tooth and then like the one

986
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:11,500
next to it yeah if you're watching these

987
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,230
two teeth

988
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:17,810
we're not gone gone gone did you ever

989
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:18,830
find them we spent like a long time

990
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:20,360
looking for them because we thought

991
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:22,400
maybe I could get it back in him you

992
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:24,560
know like we spent a long time looking

993
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,440
all over nobody could find it we thought

994
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:32,840
maybe he swallowed it but we it's not

995
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:36,290
funny it is traumatic for him I think in

996
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:38,540
the moment Greg is Luke I don't once

997
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:40,400
he's lucky but he does not realize the

998
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:42,260
scare we had to deal with we're in

999
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,470
another country yep right we don't I

1000
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:47,210

1001
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:50,090
thought he wasn't responsive because he

1002
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:51,590
was knocked out like cold um and we

1003
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:53,030

you have good friends when someone well

1017
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:27,800
we talked about the size I was willing

1018
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:29,300
to just rage out on someone double your

1019
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,670
size my whole thing was trying to stay

1020
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:33,500
calm because they came to me like ooh

didn't know I didn't know what was going

1024
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,500
on it was so loud I couldn't see

1025
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,420
anything anyway

1026
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,590
this is like a couple minutes after it

1027
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,850
already or a minute after it already

1028
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:46,340
happened when the commotion was going on

1029
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:47,750
they told me what happened and David was

1030
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:50,270
like I'm gonna kill it like he's gonna

1031
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:52,310
kill these people and the whole thing

1032
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:56,570
the whole time was this like just trying

1033
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:57,590
to calm them too and and I don't know

1034
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:59,210
where you were that

1035
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:01,580
but you were with somebody was in heaven

1036
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:02,990
yeah and then you came back down and

1037
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:05,720
then the next thing I remember we were

1038
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:07,760
um they were dead like security their

1039
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,530
version of police who are which is so

1040
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,960
funny because these huge guys are police

1041
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:14,390
are small dude like like those guys

1042
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:16,760
wanted to they no one could stop them

1043
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:20,080
they're like huge and they're police

1044
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:23,330
people were very tiny like our size

1045
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:25,850
anyway they took statements I guess like

1046
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:27,170
that dude did all that thing I'm sure

1047
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:29,030
they took them in you went to the

1048
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:30,830
hospital I was rushed to the hospital

1049
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:33,410

1050
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:35,270

you kept trying to you just kept falling

1066
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:07,250

1068
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,490
apologizing and I was like dude it's

00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:15,280
knew that your teeth were missing at

1071
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:17,120
that point so my jobs I'm trying to not

00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,830
say that to you because you're already

1073
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,630

1084
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:46,100
he didn't come with me in that no they

1085
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:48,080
didn't didn't let so we went met

1086
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:50,080
separately okay the hospital waited

1087
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:53,930
hella long you're in the room and

1088
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:57,200
they're just they just saw us in that's

1089
00:41:53,930 --> 00:42:00,830
when I woke up for ambulance no I woke

1090
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:03,620
up at the hospital and that's when like

1091
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:05,840
I consciously remember from there mm-hmm

1092
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:07,670
he has remember that first episode of

1093
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:10,220
Walking Dead when he wakes up in the

1094
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:11,269
hospital and like he doesn't know where

1095
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:13,699
he's at

1096
00:42:11,269 --> 00:42:16,009
and like everything is just foreign to

1097
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:16,789
him that's kind of like what I woke up

1098
00:42:16,009 --> 00:42:19,009
that's terrifying

1099
00:42:16,789 --> 00:42:20,989
it was legit her she know you were still

1100
00:42:19,009 --> 00:42:24,140
in Singapore so I knew that I was in

1101
00:42:20,989 --> 00:42:25,640
Singapore but I didn't know like I felt

1102
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:28,339
like I time-traveled mm-hmm and

1103
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:31,519
something happened because the lady came

1104
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:33,079
in and she she was talking to me in this

1105
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:35,959
thick accent the thick Singaporean

1106
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:38,809
accent and I mean I I could barely

1107
00:42:35,959 --> 00:42:40,999
understand her and the only thing I

1108
00:42:38,809 --> 00:42:45,619
could worry about was my hat because I

1109
00:42:40,999 --> 00:42:47,390
had hair back then and my hair was you

1110
00:42:45,619 --> 00:42:54,349
know was a mess you know like I was

1111
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:56,479
balding and was a fool here did you know

1112
00:42:54,349 --> 00:43:00,229
and then that's when I realized I was

1113
00:42:56,479 --> 00:43:03,439
like man the hell's wrong with my tongue

1114
00:43:00,229 --> 00:43:05,809
like I feel like a metal bar in my mouth

1115
00:43:03,439 --> 00:43:08,059
uh-huh and like I was feeling around in

1116
00:43:05,809 --> 00:43:10,369
that metal bar that I was feeling was my

1117
00:43:08,059 --> 00:43:13,099
braces because my tongue was poking

1118
00:43:10,369 --> 00:43:15,019
through the whole of my mic gap or your

1119
00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:16,369
teeth or you know I was feeling them the

1120
00:43:15,019 --> 00:43:20,599
braces and I was feeling like the

1121
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:22,579
bracket and or the bar the brace with

1122
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:23,839
the brackets and they were loose mm-hmm

1123
00:43:22,579 --> 00:43:25,519
you know like that the toys at the

1124
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:28,489
dentist's office were you know he can

1125
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:30,649
spin the thing on the thing yeah yeah I

1126
00:43:28,489 --> 00:43:32,929
could do that with my braces brackets

1127
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:36,979
and I was like wow that's weird and then

1128
00:43:32,929 --> 00:43:41,299
I think I had my phone and that's when I

1129
00:43:36,979 --> 00:43:44,630
popped open the the camera and I looked

1130
00:43:41,299 --> 00:43:47,059
at myself and that's when I that's when

1131
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:48,469
it finally put it missing my tea did you

1132
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:52,039

00:43:48,469 --> 00:43:54,469
you know so I was like crap what

1134
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:57,169
happened like I was like my memory was

1135
00:43:54,469 --> 00:43:59,179
so bad that I didn't even remember that

1136
00:43:57,169 --> 00:44:00,739
we were at the club the only thing I

1137
00:43:59,179 --> 00:44:03,049

1139
00:44:03,049 --> 00:44:11,989
and then you know maybe us dancing but I

1140
00:44:08,649 --> 00:44:14,809
slowly like the doctors are coming in

1141
00:44:11,989 --> 00:44:16,639
checking up on me it really started to

1142
00:44:14,809 --> 00:44:19,759
hit me that it was serious when a

1143
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:23,449
Singaporean police guy came in he was

1144
00:44:19,759 --> 00:44:24,710
like hello mr. Sonny time like how you

1145
00:44:23,449 --> 00:44:26,390

00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:27,980
need to go over some you know some

1147
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:30,500
question I have some questions for you

1148
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:32,990
and you know that's why I'm like I was

1149
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:35,960
freaking out because they were he was

1150
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:38,450
asking me if I had any gang affiliation

1151
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:41,869
wasn't like you know yeah if there was

1152
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:43,790
if I had any like firearms or anything

1153
00:44:41,869 --> 00:44:44,240
on me I was like what are you talking

1154
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:46,730
about

1155
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:48,980
and then he told me the whole back sort

1156
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:53,180
of what happened and then I was I was

1157
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:57,170
caught up from there right but I checked

1158
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:59,720
out my um you know my tent my doctor

1159
00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:02,020
stuff was all good I the the doctor said

1160
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:06,380
that they couldn't find my teeth

1161
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:09,859
supposedly I swallowed them and they

1162
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:12,320
were you know they were saying if I made

1163
00:45:09,859 --> 00:45:16,250
bowel movements recently and if they saw

1164
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:18,349
if I saw teeth in it that is like you

1165
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:23,089
know to check there or whatever and then

1166
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:26,839
I was like the after that I was released

1167
00:45:23,089 --> 00:45:29,450
and that's when you guys sent someone to

1168
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:31,490
pick me up right we were there

1169
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:33,320
ardan went in there that's right that's

1170
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:35,089
right cuz they wouldn't let me in but

1171
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:37,250
she somehow convinced them to let her in

1172
00:45:35,089 --> 00:45:38,690
that's right I think she lied honestly

1173
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:41,089
to get in to see she was like family or

1174
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:44,540
something she said that she was yeah one

1175
00:45:41,089 --> 00:45:46,940
of my family members she came in to talk

1176
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:49,220
to me and and tell me you know all the

1177
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:51,859
septa to tell them to the tell the

1178
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:53,720
police to you know like be the author

1179
00:45:51,859 --> 00:45:57,560
what to update the police what happened

1180
00:45:53,720 --> 00:46:00,070
yeah and I don't remember any of that

1181
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:05,060
I must have blacked out again I think so

1182
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:08,630
but basically what happens was I got a

1183
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:11,030
strike in Singapore how many strikes do

1184
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:15,760
you get there I don't know but I know

1185
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:19,940
here you get three strikes baseball

1186
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:22,700
strike we work with cricket or all I

1187
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:25,450
know is I have this Singaporean police

1188
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:27,800
thing this is one strike

1189
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:31,280
it's basically says you have a warning

1190
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:34,609
blow of love but the police chief guy he

1191
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:36,349
said that I have a strike don't mess

1192
00:46:34,609 --> 00:46:37,970
around here ever again yeah I don't

1193
00:46:36,349 --> 00:46:39,650
think like

1194
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:40,880
like even though even if you were gay

1195
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:42,589
like you were getting people to dance

1196
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,240
like you don't that shouldn't give you a

1197
00:46:42,589 --> 00:46:46,099
string like that guy should have like

1198
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,140
3/4 that if you get one he should have

1199
00:46:46,099 --> 00:46:52,490
at least 3 yeah you know what it was

1200
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:54,410
like a 17 strike so don't worry dude 1

1201
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:59,030
strikes not even that bad yeah you're 60

1202
00:46:54,410 --> 00:47:02,450
more I have no idea what happened to him

1203
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:05,480
supposedly he got a way worse punishing

1204
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:07,940
punishment than I did but I have no idea

1205
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:11,000
so well you could have if you wanted to

1206
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:14,119
take like in a lawsuit against him right

1207
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,260
right there was a bunch yeah became not

1208
00:47:14,119 --> 00:47:17,329
worth it right cuz you have to go back

1209
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:18,950
to Singapore something it was like if I

1210
00:47:17,329 --> 00:47:21,200
wanted to pursue it I would have had to

1211
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:23,180

after we'd finished practice after we

1241
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:44,359

laughing and like it was a weird eerie

1248
00:48:57,530 --> 00:49:03,980
feeling just like nothing was really

1249
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:06,740
that bad to like that's what it felt

1250
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:10,700
like to me except that I was missing

1251
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:13,369

1254
00:49:15,829 --> 00:49:23,510
the performance and after that we have

1255
00:49:19,849 --> 00:49:25,730
like meet and greets yep where we had to

1256
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:31,640
go to you know take pictures with fans

1257
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:34,310
and all that so every fan that was take

1258
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:36,920
pictures with me I'm known to smile

1259
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:37,970
usually whenever I'm pretty happy yeah

1260
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:40,280
I'm usually smiling

1261
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:45,020
there's not one picture of me smiling in

1262
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:47,390
that trick this tight-lipped yeah and I

1263
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:50,510
mean I feel bad but at the same time it

1264
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:51,829
that's where you know like I I came up

1265
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:54,380
with this thing you know that the thumbs

1266
00:49:51,829 --> 00:49:59,119
up picture I always do that's because of

1267
00:49:54,380 --> 00:50:01,970
that Singapore now we know so that

1268
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:04,010
awkward thing that I always do on my

1269
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:05,660
Instagram that's because you don't have

1270
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:08,450
teeth that's why I didn't have teeth and

1271
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:09,950
then you got perfect teeth almost even

1272
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:11,750
better than your original ones yeah they

1273
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:13,670
did they did a really good job with

1274
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:16,970
their clothes and ears no so I got

1275
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:19,220
implants so they went when I got back

1276
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:22,480
the dentist said yeah your jaw line is

1277
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:25,160
jacked so they had to put in bone graft

1278
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,800
was it Jack because of a punch

1279
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:30,170
yeah I think when oh damn when they when

1280
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:33,260
I when I got punched like a chunk of my

1281
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:36,609
my jaw line got you know taken out with

1282
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:40,220
it and yeah they had to put in some new

1283
00:50:36,609 --> 00:50:42,589
new bone to be able to support some

1284
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:46,520
metal implants so that way they can

1285
00:50:42,589 --> 00:50:49,460
connect new teeth too so I have to fake

1286
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:52,490
teeth and they look like the best - in

1287
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:56,089
your mouth lesson one kids if you lose

1288
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:57,500
your teeth you can worst-case scenario

1289
00:50:56,089 --> 00:50:59,450
if you can afford it

1290
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:01,970
yeah back there's all

1291
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:03,980
was a chance there's always a chance to

1292
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:05,240
get your teeth back always a chance and

1293
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:07,220
then you'll have a great story with

1294
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:09,350
friends that you can share and then also

1295
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:11,690
the lesson is don't worry about

1296
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:15,050
finishing your free alcohol yeah yes and

1297
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:18,230
also if you do finish your free alcohol

1298
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:21,410
don't dance with big people yeah so he's

1299
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:23,060
basically lucky that only two teeth left

1300
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:24,560
his mouth and his soul didn't because

1301
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:26,740
shocking that you didn't get some kind

1302
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:30,560
of brain damage maybe you did who knows

1303
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:33,050
it was pretty it was pretty um it was

1304
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:35,360
pretty intense he was over abit i watch

1305
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:36,650
you if i watch MMA yeah and like nah

1306
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,510
clothes don't normally last that long

1307
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:40,340
when they're knocked out mmm but then he

1308
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:42,290
also had alcohol in his system really

1309
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:43,910
drunk yeah and you didn't remember

1310
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:46,130
anything this is a good commercial for

1311
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:48,260
like PSA for like not getting wasted

1312
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:50,140
well if you think about it you're lucky

1313
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:51,950
you drank a lot cuz then you already had

1314
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:54,920
anesthesiology like going through your

1315
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:58,030
body sure that's my guess so yeah i

1316
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:00,860
always think about half cup half full

1317
00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:02,510
positive they're optimistic there it is

1318
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:05,630
oh the real optimistic thing is like

1319
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:07,910
crime in singapore is like punished by

1320
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:10,070
like lashings like the real bad crimes

1321
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:11,840
yeah it's not it's not like crime here

1322
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:14,150
like you honestly like i died

1323
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:16,160
you're lucky you just got a strike even

1324
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:18,740
though it wasn't your fault yeah but

1325
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:20,840
like crime there is and i'm speaking

1326
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:22,670
just from Singaporeans telling me like

1327
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:24,530
you get you can get lashings first I

1328
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:26,240
don't know what has lashings are there

1329
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:28,930
like whips like you're getting wit they

1330
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,440
have is that capital punishment I

1331
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:33,230
believe so

1332
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:36,350
they have acts like I think they still

1333
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:38,690
do hangings like yeah I could be wrong

1334
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:40,460
but Singaporeans you guys can let me

1335
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:42,440
know like that's not in the comments the

1336
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:44,540
worst thing you've heard about no but

1337
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:46,430
you can get like a legit like wit and

1338
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:48,020
like people this is another story that's

1339
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:50,630
that I was told from my Singaporean is

1340
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:52,070
like this guy did something and they

1341
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:53,750
whipped him I think like once or twice

1342
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:55,190
and it's so painful because they put

1343
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:57,440
something on the on the whip yeah

1344
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:59,630
it slices your back open and so painful

1345
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:01,550
that he passed out rather than

1346
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:03,920
continuing they waited till he woke back

1347
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:07,250
Wow to continue the rest of his lashings

1348
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:08,900
oh so it's like that's like but if you

1349
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:10,720
think about and and Singapore is one of

1350
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:12,700
the safest places in the world

1351
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:16,810
that's why with that kind of power I

1352
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:18,849
know why I know so if like I know it

1353
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:20,530
sounds inhumane right that's the

1354
00:53:18,849 --> 00:53:22,270
argument even for what people are you

1355
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:24,280
hear right for the death penalty but

1356
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:27,220
don't you think if our punishments were

1357
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:29,290
things like that you you would think

1358
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:31,329
twice about a lot of things oh for sure

1359
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:32,710
but like how do you argue that because

1360
00:53:31,329 --> 00:53:35,079
you know people will say like that's so

1361
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:40,690
inhumane you know I'm saying it would

1362
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:41,920
definitely kill comedy yes yes well the

1363
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:43,329
thing is we wouldn't change our laws

1364
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,800
right if we kept the laws of thing just

1365
00:53:43,329 --> 00:53:47,200
the punishments mmm

1366
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,970
don't you think that would work well

1367
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:50,619
this the argument is right for the death

1368
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:52,000
penalty is like what if you find out

1369
00:53:50,619 --> 00:53:53,710
later that guy was actually innocent

1370
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,660
then you murdered someone who was

1371
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:58,000
innocent Yeah right but then like we

1372
00:53:55,660 --> 00:54:00,339
still have the death penalty so like it

1373
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,010
could still happen so a Singapore we're

1374
00:54:00,339 --> 00:54:04,750
coming out next year

1375
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:05,170
I actually would love to go back to

1376
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:06,910
Singapore

1377
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:09,310
I have a great time there yeah I know I

1378
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:11,710
do don't know that Singapore has been

1379
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:13,329
great safe for us great yeah I love it

1380
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:17,440
there it's just that got was even from

1381
00:54:13,329 --> 00:54:20,220
Singapore so I don't think he was oh he

1382
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:23,290
wasn't like from a New Zealanders to

1383
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:26,109
just rowdy Americans causing trouble you

1384
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:27,220
like their country he must have had what

1385
00:54:26,109 --> 00:54:29,589
makes sense that he would have a roid

1386
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:31,750
rage because who turned around and just

1387
00:54:29,589 --> 00:54:33,160
hit someone without like pushing them

1388
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:34,390
away for like you would have if that

1389
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,950
happened there would have been a crowd

1390
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:37,780
you wouldn't have gotten punished you

1391
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:40,960
probably would have fell to the ground

1392
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:42,460
very far away escorted out yeah you

1393
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,990
would have got escorted out probably and

1394
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:45,910
him yeah and then we would have been

1395
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:48,369
fine but like well let's just say this

1396
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:50,170
Greg doesn't even know that he might

1397
00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:53,440
have pushed him in like you know I do

1398
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:55,359
everybody else that was there said the

1399
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:58,270
same thing yeah but a lot of times you

1400
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:59,470
know like in in in panic and stuff no we

1401
00:54:58,270 --> 00:55:02,230
were trying to figure out why would he

1402
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:03,790
do that that and then and then we were

1403
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:06,490
like okay well let's think about like

1404
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:07,900
this if some random dude small dude was

1405
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:09,490
coming up to you like all drunk and

1406
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,599
dancing he you would think he's trying

1407
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:12,790
to hit on you or you were thinking like

1408
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:14,230
he's you know whatever we were trying to

1409
00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:17,859
give reasons cuz it didn't make sense

1410
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:19,990
why he would have that reaction I don't

1411
00:55:17,859 --> 00:55:22,650
know I would have punch me maybe you

1412
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:22,650
said something racist

1413
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:29,510
anyway that was the UH that was a long

1414
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:31,550
story that's a funny story

1415
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:32,510
it's out there now yeah it is out there

1416
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:34,160
but I'm gonna be looking at me

1417
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:36,740
differently I don't think so your teeth

1418
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:41,540
are very nice now actually it was a show

1419
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:44,210
you show you I bet you the comments are

1420
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:45,080
gonna be like Greg hope your teeth get

1421
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:52,190
soon buddy

1422
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:55,310
well now said it was a good one yeah man

1423
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:56,110
we sold your story man hey it was worth

1424
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:58,250
it

1425
00:55:56,110 --> 00:56:01,160
plus it's barely your story that's

1426
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:05,140
morning like cancel culture thing I

1427
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:07,220
don't have to worry about anymore I

1428
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:09,350
think you think of it as a bad thing

1429
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:11,150
because you got that strike but really

1430
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:12,950
you didn't do anything other than drink
