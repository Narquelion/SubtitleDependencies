obviously and I'm not saying that

51
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,009
because I'm afraid to cry I mean I'm

52
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,450
perfectly fine with guys crying I just

53
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,160
crying for things that are real not like

54
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,629
movies and whatnot so I decided rather

55
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,430
than just doing this challenge for real

56
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,900
like everybody else I decided to make

57
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,549
for you after watching a bunch of these

58
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,530
challenges and doing research are the

59
00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:18,180
most tear-jerking movies and clips I

60
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,129
linked to my incredible research team

61
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,099

62
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:24,750

63
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,829
