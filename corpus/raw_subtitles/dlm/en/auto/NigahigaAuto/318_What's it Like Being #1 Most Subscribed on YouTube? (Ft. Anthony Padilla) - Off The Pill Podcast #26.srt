1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
basically we sold Smosh in 2011 and I

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,350
thought I had control of it for a couple

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,719
years and then come 2015 I was like oh

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:13,049
whoa whoa this is not mine anymore

5
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:16,949
I feel like youtubers now honestly have

6
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:18,480
it better in every regard except for the

7
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:20,820
over saturation in the market did you

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:27,150
feel competitive with Brian when you're

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:36,329
talking to you yes just get the clampy

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:40,950

00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:18,840
yeah so yeah I mean I we are here with I

24
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,110
mean I'm sure most people know probably

25
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,509
I I consider you and obviously Ian D

26
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,189
like grandfathers of YouTube because you

27
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,280
guys started in the very beginning I am

28
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:31,350
honored I am honored but I mean you were

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,759
like you were like was there people

30
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,060
before you nobody even knows I don't

31
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,950
know I don't know I can't really uh I've

32
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,360
never been able to take that in people

33
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,560
say that seemed like a shut up

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,670
but if you think about it though when

35
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,340
you guys started I don't even know I

36
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,960
wasn't on YouTube in oh five yeah yeah

37
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,549
yeah we started uploading a November

38
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,470
2005 there was there wasn't really

39
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:50,520
anyone that that uploaded consistently

40
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,189
alright time there were other people

41
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,840
obviously but not personalities per se

42
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:56,280
you know not people that people would

43
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,549
come back to say over and over again

44
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,930
well for people who don't know just

45
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:02,640
probably a lot let's be honest yeah

46
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,509
everyone's a different time people who

47
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,940
don't know you and Ian who we had a few

48
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:11,009
a bunch of episodes ago are from Smosh

49
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,240
and Smosh has over 25 million

50
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:14,310
subscribers

51
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,080
you recently started well recently like

52
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,270
two years ago years ago start your own

53
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,410
channel which is at about three point

54
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,050
three million subscribers which is

55
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,730
pretty crazy in like two years right

56
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,370
it's nice and healthy and I like it

57
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,810
yeah and yeah you've been just working

58
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,490
on your own channel we just did

59
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,460
something together as well yeah yeah

60
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:34,310
how's that been it's been really nice

61
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,330
now it's really nice there was a

62
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,070
transition period that was really

63
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,870
difficult going from a channel I don't

64
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:43,410
know how many million subscribers I had

65
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,750
when I left 23 million or whatever to do

66
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,950
my own thing and then people came over

67
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,930
and wanted to see what I was doing there

68
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,880
but truth be told I was still trying to

69
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,460
figure out what it was that he wanted to

70
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,070
do on my own you know and when I started

71
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,150
Smosh with Ian back in the day we were

72
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,700
able to figure it out without anyone

73
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,830
watching but now I was trying to figure

74
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,720
out what I wanted to do on my own and

75
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:06,120
millions of people were watching and it

76
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,220
was a lot of pressure but eventually

77
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,650
years later now I feel like I finally

78
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,630
figured out what it is that I want to do

79
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,780
and I am really enjoying it yeah I mean

80
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:18,540
your your content is more geared like

81
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,280
towards an older audience um yeah where

82
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,320
is that I feel like Smosh was a little

83
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,140
bit more for younger people right coming

84
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,000
in yeah for sure you know I it was it

85
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,900
was just outright just straight-up

86
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,030
comedy for lack of a better term I'd say

87
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,530
it was a little bit more shallow because

88
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,390
there wasn't really a message that we

89
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,920
were always trying to spread or anything

90
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,660
like that was just comfort laughs and

91
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,530
leave with a smile on your face right

92
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,580
and now the stuff that I'm doing I hope

93
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:47,370
has a little bit more of a deeper

94
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,540
message you know I hope people leave my

95
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,360
video is now feeling like they

96
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:55,140
understand people more mm-hmm

97
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,000
with the yeah it was I spent a day with

98
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,770
blank you know so the one that I just

99
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,760
shot with you Ryan was I spent a day

100
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:05,670
with legendary youtubers and basically

101
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:09,380
gets a funny way to describe legendary I

102
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:13,670
mean dude like you are one of the most

103
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:13,670
legendary youtubers I don't know how

104
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:19,260
funny because it's like you were first

105
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,450
like you guys were the first we're not

106
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,550
talking about me they know but you're in

107
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,889
it and you haven't

108
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:27,139
address that right you guys refer I

109
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:28,849
remember I started to not see actually

110
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:32,090
David was before I was oh really

111
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:34,460
yeah and I remember watching your

112
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:36,800
Pokemon video it was featured on the

113
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:39,979
home page of YouTube that's when I first

114
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,930
crazy yeah copyrighted material yeah you

115
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:43,220
do homepage Wow

116
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,840
well there is no money to be made so

117
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,030
there was no one complaining well yeah

118
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,250
that's true yeah yeah that is crazy

119
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:53,240
though I'm honored yeah you guys are I

120
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:56,210
mean people call me og right but then

121
00:04:53,240 --> 00:05:05,900
when I think of Smosh I'm like actually

122
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:07,250
no I mean no it is really difficult for

123
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,139
me to take a compliment so probably good

124
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,370
to stop there yeah so what else do we

125
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:13,280
want to talk about that's really nice

126
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:15,470
eight point seven billion total views on

127
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:20,539
Smosh channel that you helped create

128
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:24,440
yeah yeah created I I initially made

129
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:25,759
Smosh as just a website and I was just

130
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,849
for me and my group of friends in high

131
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,349
school and you know so that that logo

132
00:05:28,849 --> 00:05:33,620
and everything was me as a 14 year old

133
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:35,180
kid you know in my bedroom just like

134
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,280
tinkering away with a little logo and

135
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:40,219
stuff and it's it is strange that you

136
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,930
know it became a brand and then you know

137
00:05:40,219 --> 00:05:45,320
I can leave that continue to do my own

138
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:48,919
thing and that brand still exists out

139
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:51,500
there how not to get right into it but

140
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:53,240
how I mean it wasn't a split instant

141
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,780
decision when you decided to leave Smosh

142
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,710
No

143
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:58,550
how long were you unhappy there I know

144
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:02,150
it's a long story

145
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:04,060
yeah yeah yeah I started having my I

146
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:07,400
started second-guessing everything in

147
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:09,050
early 2015 which was about a year year

148
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,380
and a half before I eventually left

149
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:14,930
because I realized how much this brand

150
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:19,729
that I thought I had ownership of was

151
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:22,909
really just you know the it was we

152
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:24,830
basically we sold Smosh in 2011 and I

153
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:27,229
thought I had control of it for a couple

154
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:29,419
years and then come 2015 I was like oh

155
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:30,830
whoa whoa whoa this is not mine anymore

156
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:32,479
other people are controlling it they

157
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:35,320
wanted to be a certain way I want this

158
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:38,440
to evolve I want this to kind of

159
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:40,330
keep up with me as I age and my values

160
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,280
change but because it wasn't mine

161
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:45,010
because it was owned by a company they

162
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,510
had very clear ideas for what that brand

163
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:48,940
should be and what it should remain as

164
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:51,010
he gave me or give us an example of like

165
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:53,290
like something that they let you try to

166
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,510
do and they were like no no no that's

167
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:57,100
not like like I guess the cousin you're

168
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:59,200
doing now is that something you tried to

169
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,270
do earlier or no I didn't I didn't

170
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,560
necessarily you know I got to be honest

171
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,210
I didn't necessarily try to do something

172
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,650
that they outright said no don't do that

173
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:12,100
but they were now you know 20 30 people

174
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:14,080
working without me necessarily giving a

175
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,810
direction to them and they were all

176
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,790
doing this thing and plans were being

177
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:21,010
made constantly I couldn't tell everyone

178
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:22,810
to stop and you know whole production on

179
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:24,370
a million different things that were

180
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:27,700
going on behind the scenes so I could

181
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:29,290
come in and change things it wasn't it

182
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:32,710
didn't operate the same way as just two

183
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:34,660
guys obviously you know I there were so

184
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:36,010
many more moving elements to it that it

185
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:39,850
became apparent that it wasn't mine

186
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:41,740
mm-hmm you know so when you say in 2011

187
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:43,210
right you said we sold so when you say

188
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,070
that you sold what did that mean cuz you

189
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,720
guys were still like I never understood

190
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,910
that yes because you guys were still on

191
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,190
it could yeah all the time yeah what

192
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,990
changed basically from 2010 or right

193
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:56,200
before you sold it mm-hmm what changed

194
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:59,200
um a company approached us and said hey

195
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:03,670
we can offer you X amount of money in

196
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:06,640
stocks and we will now own the company

197
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:08,680
100% you will be employees of this

198
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:13,030
company you will be salaried we will pay

199
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:16,330
you well and you know me growing up from

200
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:18,850
a pretty poor family in suburban

201
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:20,230
Sacramento I was like yeah you know that

202
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:23,710
sounds great I don't know what the

203
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:25,480
future of this is gonna look like and I

204
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:28,030
get to have a guaranteed paycheck which

205
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,490
is very strong like especially at the

206
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:33,310
time oh yeah it wasn't like we weren't

207
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:35,740
sure at in 2010 yeah that this was gonna

208
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:39,099
continue yeah I was 23 and I was like I

209
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:41,060
need to make sure that I am set up in

210
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:43,310
any way that I can

211
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,990
and I just had a fear that I was gonna

212
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:48,350
be stuck in poverty forever so I was

213
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:51,650
like this is my way out you know give me

214
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:53,960
that give me that paycheck and you know

215
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:56,390
that monthly paycheck and that that

216
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,640
stock that you value the company to be

217
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,839
worth I will take that and hold on to

218
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,010
that and hopefully sell it for a lot in

219
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,750
the future and then you know I could

220
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:05,750
retire or sell my own company on the

221
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,910
side or whatever and spoiler alert when

222
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:10,010
the company shut down last year that

223
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:13,520
stock just evaporated into nothing ever

224
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:15,650
ended up - yeah you guys got screwed

225
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:20,330
uh yeah yeah yeah we got screwed but I I

226
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:24,560
also I also feel slightly responsible

227
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:26,060
for that you know so I feel like I if I

228
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,290
were smarter I would have asked more

229
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,000
questions I would have had more people

230
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:30,950
looking into it for me I would have done

231
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,070
more research instead of being so

232
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:35,480
excited to sign that dotted line right

233
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:39,529
did you have a lawyer look over your

234
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:41,690
contract well as a lawyer but I don't

235
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:44,839
know if the lawyer really had my best

236
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:46,460
interest you know yeah and and there

237
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:48,140
were other people that had their hands

238
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:51,110
in it that I know didn't have my best

239
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:54,140
interest in it so maybe it's safe to say

240
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:57,050
that you know a 23 year old from a small

241
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:58,400
town was taken advantage of or two of us

242
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:00,770
I guess yeah we're you and Ian on the

243
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:05,240
same page during all this we were yeah

244
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:07,040
we were but I feel like we really didn't

245
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,500
do enough research we didn't really look

246
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,330
into it enough and there was something

247
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,270
about the the pace at which we were

248
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:16,520
creating content and just moving

249
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:21,440
constantly that it felt like we couldn't

250
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:24,290
really take time to to really take it

251
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,790
all in yeah we weren't able to really

252
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,140
soak it in and understand what we're

253
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:29,839
really doing or that you know I can only

254
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:31,880
speak for myself right yeah well I mean

255
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,010
I I mean that makes sense because I I

256
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,740
think it was around that same time maybe

257
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:39,529
2000 a little earlier like 2009 for me

258
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:42,730
where I almost gave up my channel to do

259
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:42,730
a Nickelodeon show whoa

260
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:47,600
it's it's a show that actually was

261
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:49,820
created yeah it was called Supah Ninjas

262
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,920
uh-huh and it was kind of based off of I

263
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:54,420
don't we did a lot of ninja stuff yeah

264
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,220
yeah that should I

265
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,560
it went out for like two seasons I think

266
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,090
but anyway it was a Nickelodeon show and

267
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,500
Shawn and I were gonna do it but then

268
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:03,180
they said you got to get rid of your

269
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,700
channel or everything on it's not

270
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:07,320
Nickelodeon appropriate yeah yeah I get

271
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,150
I was pretty clean though but I mean

272
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,040
they were clean that's really again I

273
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:15,270
get because Nickelodeon super super

274
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,890
clean yeah but it was a time where like

275
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:18,960
I had literally I was considering it

276
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:21,120
like I was probably making more on

277
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,500
YouTube then I was gonna make on

278
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,360
Nickelodeon but there was something

279
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,970
about it being a real thing right yeah

280
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,160
nobody knew YouTube is gonna be a thing

281
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:30,810
so I I completely understand like if you

282
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,180
someone told me hey here's a salary I

283
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:35,610
mean and it was a great amount oh yeah

284
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:37,830
oh yeah yeah then for sure

285
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:39,510
yeah so I mean I don't think that's uh I

286
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,790
don't think they can be helped like I

287
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:43,290
said you guys were like a pioneer right

288
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:45,480
so nobody there was no rules back then

289
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,950
no there's like the business it was the

290
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,300
Wild West and you yeah you didn't have

291
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:52,020
any figure it out and that's what it was

292
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:56,780
mm-hmm so yeah people definitely saw the

293
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,780
goldmine oh yeah other people did yeah

294
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:03,270
probably specifically artists right yeah

295
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:05,160
yeah I remember back in the day there

296
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:08,220
was talk amongst the YouTube community

297
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:11,040
about you guys working with the Disney

298
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,600
executive maybe he was a manager yeah

299
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,000
yeah he started off as our manager and

300
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,800
he became the president of the company I

301
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,680
don't wanna get too much details until

302
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,960
now or went when the company dissolved

303
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,000
he was he was still there I think he

304
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:27,380
left about six months before I did for

305
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,120
his own personal reasons yeah got it

306
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:33,870
well uh just going back to kind of what

307
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,430
you said so there there seems to be like

308
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:38,340
a lot of different pros and cons to

309
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:40,140
being like a legendary og youtubers you

310
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,790
know like one of the big cons of being

311
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,410
taken advantage of clearly yeah back

312
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:46,170
then when no one knew was going yeah so

313
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:48,240
I guess we want that if there's more

314
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:51,900
pros and cons that you wanted to explore

315
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,180
on or maybe in comparison of like the

316
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:57,420
youtubers now then they haven't that I

317
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:58,830
guess a lot of people can thank you for

318
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,750
in a way because you had to deal with

319
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:03,440
those hardships oh I see you're saying I

320
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:07,350
I feel like uh youtubers now honestly

321
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,240
have it better in every regard

322
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:11,130
except for the oversaturation in the

323
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,080
market there's so much more competition

324
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:14,610
and really that's that's the only

325
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,840
downside that I see maybe there's more

326
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,580
that I don't see because I'm kind of

327
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,600
disconnected from that now but I feel

328
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:21,030
like back in the early days it was

329
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,220
figuring things out on your own it was

330
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:26,010
the lack of money in the market there

331
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:30,270
were obviously less viewers on the

332
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:34,320
market to to to have content even be

333
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:36,420
viewed by and brands didn't take it

334
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,800
seriously companies in take it take you

335
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,810
seriously and I feel like all of that

336
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,430
has changed yep and the only thing

337
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:44,370
that's that's become difficult is that

338
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:47,160
now there's just so many people that are

339
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:50,100
that are part of it yeah well I mean a

340
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,350
big difference to is like you know back

341
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,240
in the day there was I mean we say

342
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,500
there's a lot less people but there was

343
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,560
still a lot of people oh yeah I mean

344
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,000
yeah but I feel like back in the day

345
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,490
it's like if somebody made something

346
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,100
awesome yeah eventually people would

347
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:07,110
find that person right I feel like now

348
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,310
you gotta be with some you got to get

349
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,620
some kind of hookup like you gotta be

350
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:13,050
collabing unless you're like magnificent

351
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:15,570
mmm I hate like you have to like be with

352
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:17,910
an MCN or you gotta like be friends with

353
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:19,380
somebody there's always like you gotta

354
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,730
have like connections in collab and do

355
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,980
all these things were like back in the

356
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:24,870
days just just make good stuff and then

357
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,190
eventually it'll pay off yeah used to be

358
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:29,280
my advice to people they'd be like how

359
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:31,530
do I get my content like how do I create

360
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,060
a fanbase and I'd always be like just

361
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:34,770
make good stuff focus on making good

362
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,720
stuff don't try to get fans they'll come

363
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,740
to you and eventually people will find

364
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,420
your stuff when you make good enough

365
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,390
stuff you can't say that now nope that

366
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:44,130
doesn't mean sadly yeah like it used to

367
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:48,120
be like just just do your follow your

368
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:49,860
dreams and no no no through the math yes

369
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,290
follow the algorithm there's there's

370
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:55,350
like twenty one day's worth of content

371
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:57,420
uploaded every minute on YouTube or

372
00:14:55,350 --> 00:15:00,810
something ridiculous right yeah that's

373
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:03,690
crazy yeah it's just insane and I don't

374
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:04,920
know if YouTube like wants to admit it

375
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:07,430
or not but I feel like YouTube has

376
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,750
become just a gaming and music platform

377
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:12,210
the things that are there are on

378
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:15,810
trending at the time is just like music

379
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:17,310
yeah I I don't know if it was always

380
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:19,960
like that or not but I feel like it's

381
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:22,240
it's gone that direction

382
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,920
the trending tab to check it don't want

383
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,280
us no not really I think it was out

384
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,860
because I'm curious yeah so but it

385
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,360
doesn't I don't I don't understand it

386
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,790
maybe there'll be a video with like

387
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,320
10,000 views on it no one understands

388
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,750
how trending works I think it's some

389
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,130
combination of the speed at which

390
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,020
viewers are coming in and the

391
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:42,700
interaction they're having with the

392
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:45,160
content and also where they're coming

393
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:47,500
from mm-hmm I don't understand the exact

394
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,800
algorithm though yeah I have no idea

395
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,630
either

396
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:53,500
I think the algorithm is always changing

397
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:55,180
the advertisers and yeah different times

398
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,220
it's always change you said we're always

399
00:15:55,180 --> 00:16:00,160
chasing the algorithm yeah and you never

400
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:02,680
you never know what is gonna work really

401
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,510
you know the the best way to do things

402
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,890
now is just like try to get an audience

403
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,690
to stay with your video as long as you

404
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,650
can mm-hmm that's the only thing so it

405
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,690
goes back to what you guys were saying

406
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:12,430
make good content make good conscious

407
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:13,900
keep going yeah but it's different now

408
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,760
it's not just it's not just make good

409
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,470
content but it's make captivating

410
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,330
content that people feel like they can't

411
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:21,790
click away from yes they're constantly

412
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:23,260
you know on that page there's always at

413
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,790
least one other video that can be seen

414
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:27,220
on the screen at once unless it's in a

415
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:29,950
full screen yeah and that video is

416
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:31,600
always enticing them and you're battling

417
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:34,390
to keep people watching instead of

418
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,250
clicking that other person's derail but

419
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:38,260
that's thing to like you need to have a

420
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:40,480
really good title and thumbnail yes so

421
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,830
that they they click away from someone

422
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,140
else's we're here to go to yours and

423
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:46,030
also you know the title and thumbnail is

424
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:48,220
all that really matter if you think

425
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:51,160
about it in this context and your video

426
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:53,110
content is just there to prove that it

427
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,530
was worth that click it's it's almost

428
00:16:53,110 --> 00:17:00,190
backwards now exactly up well that's the

429
00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:01,420
secrets of YouTube well I want to

430
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:03,760
explore this a little bit more because

431
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:06,670
uh you decided to step away make your

432
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:09,790
own content you know you had millions of

433
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:11,530
people's eyes on you yeah we're I'm sure

434
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:13,060
you felt the pressure of like you know

435
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,890
your former boss is looking over your

436
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,000
shoulder now yep a lot of eyes looking

437
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:19,990
over your shoulder but you do have this

438
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,700
open creativity how much did you play

439
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:23,380
around the algorithm and stuff or were

440
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:25,240
you more strictly like no I want to do

441
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,830
what I want to do no you know how do you

442
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,390
how do you play the game like what's

443
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:31,330
your mindset now yeah

444
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:33,000
tackling you ah initially I didn't even

445
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:35,669
know what

446
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,190
once it from me I just made content when

447
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:40,260
I first left and I experiments it with a

448
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:42,770
million different types of videos and

449
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,940
the things that's the thing that stuck

450
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:47,460
work was content that was a little bit

451
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,929
longer and appealed to a general

452
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,570
audience that didn't necessarily know

453
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:53,220
have to know who I was to view it so

454
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,110
then I started making more of that and

455
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,640
that eventually evolved into that I

456
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:59,370
spent a day with series which is what I

457
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,080
just shot with you today Ryan yeah yeah

458
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,150
and I think that really works because

459
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,299
it's it's captivating in the sense that

460
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:07,710
it's a subject that's easily digestible

461
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:10,559
people are like oh I want to learn more

462
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:13,530
about whatever it is legendary youtubers

463
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:17,340
or you know Pro cosplayers or

464
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:19,710
flat-earthers or a SM artists and they

465
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,780
stick around because the way that I edit

466
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:23,880
is I think it's captivating or Mike my

467
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,409
editor is extremely good and then the

468
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,760
contents long enough that the YouTube

469
00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:29,039
algorithm rewards you for that watch

470
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,169
time right right yeah it's kind of a

471
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,450
formula it's a way yeah for sure and you

472
00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:35,010
got it you have to unfortunately I tried

473
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:37,380
to fight it for the longest time really

474
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:40,230
short content like no I'm sticking to

475
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,419
what I grew up with like it but you have

476
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:44,640
to you have to certain degree you want

477
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:47,370
to be able to keep ya audience keyboard

478
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,780
keep doing it as a career right hi yeah

479
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,610
you have to you have to find that

480
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:52,799
balance and I was always so against it

481
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:54,360
but I like I finally got to a point

482
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,190
where like okay I'm willing to give

483
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,230
because there's no point if if no one's

484
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:59,429
seen it right yeah yeah and it's a hard

485
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,600
position to be in because you're like I

486
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:02,940
wanna make the content that I like

487
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,530
that's why I started that's why I want

488
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,900
to keep going that's what gets me up in

489
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:08,669
the morning but at the same time you

490
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,630
want to be able to keep doing that yeah

491
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:12,120
and you're not gonna be able to keep

492
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:14,490
making content at all if people aren't

493
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,620
watching exactly so you have to find a

494
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,970
happy marriage between this is what my

495
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:20,490
audience wants this where the general

496
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:23,100
public wants when they find my videos

497
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:25,919
and also this is what I like to do and

498
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:27,330
it's a game they get to play figure out

499
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,890
what it is that you like versus you know

500
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:31,200
what's gonna get people tips from a

501
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,970
legendary youtuber go check out enjoy go

502
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:42,000
check but check out is serious I dare

503
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:43,559
you do was it C on that and I don't know

504
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,820
if this is why I mean we already cuz we

505
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,779
already talked to Ian so we know that

506
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,789
you guys are cool and

507
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:51,289
stuff but how weird would it be to have

508
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:54,239
en on the show to have him on my show

509
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:57,239
because it would be you to you and yeah

510
00:19:54,239 --> 00:20:00,629
yeah I mean I've distance myself from

511
00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:02,369
doing anything Smosh related and I'm

512
00:20:00,629 --> 00:20:05,190
happy with that for the time being

513
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:07,859
because I really want to establish

514
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:10,190
myself as an independent creator as

515
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:12,659
someone that's doing their own thing and

516
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:14,249
people will always say Anthony from

517
00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:17,700
Smosh which doesn't bother me but the

518
00:20:14,249 --> 00:20:20,339
same time I I feel like I could be known

519
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,409
for what I'm doing now just as much and

520
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:25,589
I feel like I need to do that before I

521
00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:27,929
mm-hmm start pressure revisiting my past

522
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:29,669
and and you know inviting people used to

523
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:31,440
being small or short or whatever you

524
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:32,549
know I feel like I need to establish but

525
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,549
that's what I mean that I feel like it's

526
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:38,369
so you're saying legendary youtubers I

527
00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:39,779
can think of more like fitting than you

528
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:42,179
guys that's why I brought that up on

529
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:44,249
your show like what you should be really

530
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:45,989
asking yourself a lot of stuff but it's

531
00:20:44,249 --> 00:20:47,639
just a weird scenario because I guess it

532
00:20:45,989 --> 00:20:49,619
makes sense it makes sense because you

533
00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:51,149
can really interview yourself well yeah

534
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:53,460
also I know I know what the hell's going

535
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:55,649
on in my life oh I know what you see

536
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:58,200
your answers to other questions too well

537
00:20:55,649 --> 00:21:00,359
you could ask him right now no on off

538
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,820
the bill pot yeah that's the stuff out

539
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:07,109
when we were talking about all I want to

540
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:10,229
ask you the same I got a question here

541
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:11,759
so you know you're a lot of youtubers

542
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:14,099
they want to make the transition into

543
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:15,599
Hollywood and it seems like you you know

544
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:17,489
you're one of the very few youtubers

545
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:19,739
have stayed true to the platform and

546
00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:21,389
creating mmm you know being a youtuber

547
00:21:19,739 --> 00:21:24,239
mm-hmm and in every sense of that word

548
00:21:21,389 --> 00:21:25,859
mm do you have do you still have desired

549
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:27,989
I mean I don't know if you ever did but

550
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:33,139
do you have desire to cross over yeah

551
00:21:27,989 --> 00:21:35,729
yeah I I I do really enjoy acting and I

552
00:21:33,139 --> 00:21:37,409
have really been enjoying learning how

553
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:39,809
to get in touch with my emotions and

554
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:42,539
express those emotions not just you know

555
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:44,820
through my therapy which you know helped

556
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:47,099
me get over all that stuff that we

557
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:49,049
talked about with with companies and my

558
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:50,909
old company and all that but it also

559
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:52,889
helped me realize that I've been

560
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:54,580
avoiding being in touch with my feelings

561
00:21:52,889 --> 00:21:56,260
for so long

562
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:59,320
and acting kind of goes hand-in-hand

563
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:01,360
with therapy I feel it'll I've been able

564
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,909
to tap into why I'm feeling the things

565
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,309
that I'm feeling and acting is a lot

566
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:09,010
about that it's about feeling things and

567
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:11,440
not not saying or trying to show things

568
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:13,779
which is actually feeling them and I

569
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,630
feel like that's something that a lot of

570
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:18,610
people don't really get a lot of on

571
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:19,750
YouTube so I've been taking some of that

572
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:21,460
like I've something like I'm just gonna

573
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:24,610
talk about my feelings on here and see

574
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:28,380
how people feel about that and then I

575
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:30,760
feel like they also people want to

576
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:32,919
listen more when you talk about your

577
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:36,789
feelings and you're vulnerable so I want

578
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:38,710
to get good at acting too so that maybe

579
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:40,510
people will listen to what I have to say

580
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:43,090
because you know they could they see me

581
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:44,980
exploring my emotions on screen mm-hmm

582
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:47,200
do you feel like those videos where you

583
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:49,600
do explore your most emotion do a lot

584
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,850
better yeah for sure for sure and people

585
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,679
have I think they feel a little bit more

586
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:57,309
of a connection because they feel like

587
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,690
you know I'm being real yeah and I feel

588
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:01,210
like on YouTube it's kind of hard to

589
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:02,710
find people that are being real mm-hmm

590
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,120
are you referring to some people when

591
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:07,149
you say that I'm not referring to anyone

592
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:09,789
general I'm just saying for my general

593
00:23:07,149 --> 00:23:12,360
person but I have a follow-up question I

594
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:14,679
guess because you know you said this

595
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,179
platform is being oversaturated yeah

596
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:18,580
where a lot of in the beginning was kind

597
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:20,649
of like you know it is a lot more raw

598
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:22,210
this is we are this is our how we feel

599
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,919
hmm and then it became like mass

600
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:25,870
production where you took the feeling

601
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,950
out yeah because it's so much so like we

602
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:29,860
need to keep pushing these out just

603
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:31,600
content content that in a way audiences

604
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:33,519
now are looking for something more than

605
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,679
to continue in that swai you do have

606
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:38,049
that connection a lot more yeah exactly

607
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:42,059
I feel like I'm just I'm tired of

608
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:44,740
shallow content and I don't enjoy

609
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:47,860
watching it I don't enjoy making it and

610
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:49,240
I'm honestly like I I feel like people

611
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,639
must be feeling the same way I'm feeling

612
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:54,159
because I'm just tired of it was what's

613
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:56,559
shell what is shallow content for me

614
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,750
it's it's coming it's it's it's almost

615
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:02,289
like a it's watching something and

616
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:03,460
feeling like it was really just

617
00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:06,130
entertainment

618
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:09,460
you know it's um it's like a challenge

619
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:10,510
video or I don't know I can't think of

620
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:13,360
something specific because I honestly

621
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:16,000
don't watch that stuff it's something

622
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,279
that I feel like doesn't really make me

623
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,950
leave feeling like I learned something

624
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:22,270
or you know maybe I learn something

625
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:25,419
about a subject or learn something about

626
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:28,990
the human psyche in some way so how does

627
00:24:25,419 --> 00:24:32,529
that sound pretentious that's your

628
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:34,990
interest what are some things on YouTube

629
00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:38,820
that you like watching anything that has

630
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:41,830
education attached to it in some way

631
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:43,600
what's the German channel that starts

632
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:46,450
with the K that's all animated and so

633
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,890
educational cursed well I don't know

634
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:50,860
something like that starts with the K I

635
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:52,690
can never say what say we say I hope I

636
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:56,830
hope I offended someone when I say

637
00:24:52,690 --> 00:25:01,029
definitely yeah I'm getting cancelled

638
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:04,029
right now just with a case that would be

639
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:05,200
the Russian version um I'm if just

640
00:25:04,029 --> 00:25:07,330
offending everyone yeah you're gonna get

641
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,390
so cancer I'm getting Hansel Germans and

642
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:12,130
the Russians yeah um but basically

643
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:13,450
education is what you're saying you want

644
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:15,429
to learn now that's that's where I

645
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:17,919
that's what I feel like I didn't waste

646
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:18,909
my time coming out of you know or you

647
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,200
know something like this like a podcast

648
00:25:18,909 --> 00:25:22,240
where people are talking about how they

649
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:26,700
feel in their experiences right I also

650
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:29,740
enjoy that but coming in for content

651
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:31,149
laughing and leaving unless that content

652
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:34,720
that makes me laugh kind of says

653
00:25:31,149 --> 00:25:36,970
something about you know human behavior

654
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,850
in general or something I I will enjoy

655
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:41,169
it but I don't find myself compelled to

656
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:42,370
keep coming back over and over and over

657
00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:43,809
well I mean like that's one of the

658
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,740
reasons why I like doing the podcast as

659
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:46,809
well as cuz yeah

660
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:49,299
for me it's taken by my own selfish

661
00:25:46,809 --> 00:25:50,440
thing it's like Helen I like to like

662
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:52,299
these conversations I could never

663
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,520
normally have you know what videos right

664
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:56,470
and then also like talking to people

665
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:59,140
that you relate to other youtubers yeah

666
00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:00,760
and you know up until recently a lot of

667
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,649
the you know talking about like burning

668
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,179
out and like and feeling like the

669
00:26:02,649 --> 00:26:06,429
pressures and all that stuff was very

670
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:07,570
kept to yourself up until like the past

671
00:26:06,429 --> 00:26:09,190
few years that's true I didn't know

672
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:11,140
you're feeling any of this yeah I mean

673
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:13,090
no most people don't and yeah and for

674
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:14,440
the most part like you don't really put

675
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:16,530
that into your content like if when you

676
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,580
were with Smosh like you didn't

677
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:19,650
that kind of stuff it was just like

678
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,990
skits yeah this is how come you laugh

679
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:24,810
but like I mean for you yourself I mean

680
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:27,060
at what point were you when you were

681
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:28,520
with Smosh feeling that kind of I mean

682
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:30,780
if you were feeling that kind of burnout

683
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,250
mm-hmm and it was it more a burnout

684
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,690
because of workload or was it because

685
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,670
you just didn't want to be creating that

686
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:37,050
kind of content anymore it was more than

687
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:39,030
I just didn't feel like creating that

688
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:40,890
kind of content I am a workaholic so I

689
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:42,300
love working all the time so it didn't

690
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:44,580
really bother me you know the workload

691
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:47,100
didn't bother ya it was more just you

692
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:49,170
don't you wanted to get out of it yeah

693
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,510
and I still I still enjoyed it you know

694
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:53,820
so it wasn't really black-and-white

695
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:57,420
because I did still enjoy it but I felt

696
00:26:53,820 --> 00:27:00,870
like I enjoyed or as more being pulled

697
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:02,310
toward other kinds of content mhm but

698
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:04,800
even like you said you always enjoyed

699
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:09,210
acting did you enjoy acting in that

700
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:11,400
style I did not you got over it right we

701
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:13,710
got super over it after a couple years I

702
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:17,670
would imagine so yeah you know just

703
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:19,760
acting [ __ ] it was like that's basically

704
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:22,500
how I would define my acting and smart

705
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,150
yeah just like high-pitched like kids

706
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,710
like that right it's like it you know we

707
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:28,770
got over it yeah you know I started when

708
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:31,620
I was 17 18 and I was making content

709
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:34,110
that I thought was you know funny and at

710
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:36,240
the same time people a couple years

711
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:38,100
younger than me which ended up being 12

712
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,860
13 14 year olds thought it was funny and

713
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:43,500
that kind of fit in with with what their

714
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:45,210
interests were but as I grew you know I

715
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,160
left some when I was 29 I feel like I

716
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:48,840
couldn't keep making content for the

717
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,450
same people that I was making it for

718
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:53,100
when I first started right right so and

719
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:55,260
then so when you first cuz you said you

720
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:58,380
are doing what you want to do now yeah

721
00:27:55,260 --> 00:28:01,710
when you first had left and did your own

722
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:04,380
channel hmm how long like what what kind

723
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:06,330
of I didn't watch enough to know yeah I

724
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:08,520
saw the first couple videos it you know

725
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:10,680
it was being talked about but like how

726
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,600
how was that process because it must

727
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,210
have been I know you had some struggles

728
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,350
I saw some interviews and stuff but like

729
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:19,950
what were you thinking of feeling during

730
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:21,720
that time it was pretty supportive right

731
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:23,400
oh really supportive you know I was

732
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,640
really happy with all the support that I

733
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,950
had other other youtubers fans from from

734
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,420
back over at Smosh

735
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:33,750
the whole community seemed really

736
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:35,640
supportive of everything but it was it

737
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:38,550
was a struggle because I wanted to make

738
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:43,350
stuff and I didn't know what to make and

739
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:46,290
I also felt like this opportunity had

740
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:48,420
been given to me to create content on

741
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:50,130
YouTube and speak to a large amount of

742
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:51,690
people and I knew that I made a lot of

743
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:53,040
people happy when I was making content

744
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:56,730
as Smosh and I wanted to do that for

745
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:59,600
myself but I didn't know what to do and

746
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:03,650
I was also giving myself pressure to

747
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:06,120
immediately get bigger numbers and

748
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:08,220
appeal to just as many people as I did

749
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,350
on Smosh so I had immense amount of

750
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:12,270
pressure constantly over my shoulders

751
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:16,290
and I feel like it wasn't really until I

752
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:18,450
got over that that I was able to focus

753
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:21,030
on what it what is it that I like to do

754
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:23,310
like what kind of message do I want to

755
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:25,260
spread by these videos right you know I

756
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:28,700
realized that I am tired of watching

757
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:32,130
like I said shallower stuff but also

758
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:34,520
negative negativity on YouTube is such a

759
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:39,080
huge thing that's popular right now yeah

760
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:41,790
from a lot of commentary channels and

761
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:44,460
reaction channels and things like that

762
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:46,350
and I'm not saying react channel that

763
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:48,000
that is a positive space but there are

764
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:49,920
channels where people react to things in

765
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,240
a negative way and like roasting is so

766
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,340
popular and stuff like that and I just

767
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,260
I'm kind of tired of it I'm like we have

768
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,910
a choice about what kind of a message we

769
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:59,610
want to spread and how we want people to

770
00:29:56,910 --> 00:30:01,440
feel after watching our videos so why

771
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:03,900
not take that and make it something

772
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,730
positive that makes you feel good and

773
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:08,130
not in the cheesy wholesome way where

774
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:09,750
you know I'm like ooh this this feels

775
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:11,670
gross this feels like I'm in a cult like

776
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:13,650
this is not you're not being honest when

777
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:16,950
you're trying to be wholesome here yeah

778
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:21,750
so I try to make my content I try to

779
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:24,930
have be like wholesome and make you feel

780
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:26,580
like just make you feel happy at the end

781
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:28,410
of it but at the same time come at you

782
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:32,190
with jokes and be really fast-paced and

783
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:33,870
a little bit edgy at the same time god

784
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:35,850
I've never explained any of that stuff

785
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:39,120
before so I didn't know how to put that

786
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:40,470
into words so yeah that's that's good

787
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,880
though cuz there's clearly shows that

788
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:45,150
you thought about it a lot

789
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,720
so and yeah like you said you went to

790
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:47,700
therapy

791
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:50,370
yeah I'm still going trust me that's

792
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:52,410
good it's good and I would recommend it

793
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:54,240
to everyone that can because it's it's

794
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:57,049
made me realize things about my past may

795
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,309
be more sympathetic toward my past self

796
00:30:57,049 --> 00:31:01,530
and therefore made me more sympathetic

797
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:04,650
toward my current self because I

798
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:07,919
understand why I am the way I am more

799
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:09,090
right okay well with that being said

800
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,679

866
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:19,290
number one Smosh was number two and when

867
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:24,089
the Smosh was number one Ryan was number

868
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:26,040
two I mean I'm asking is Anthony yeah

competitive when you didn't really know

871
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:33,990

900
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:37,880
yeah I like that stuff I'm sure it I

901
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:39,380
mean subscriptions like we we talked

902
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:42,559
about before it doesn't matter as much

903
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:44,180
yeah but yeah but at the time it did

904
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:45,770
yeah it was a big deal because it

905
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:47,480
actually you know meant something like

906
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:48,740
people act your subscribers would get

907
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,690
your videos yeah always

908
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:53,359
and there were top subscriber lists

909
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:55,250
exact they were top most viewed the day

910
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,299
of the month of that whatever and those

911
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,650
would be lists that people would

912
00:35:56,299 --> 00:35:59,150
frequent and that's how you would get

913
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:00,799
new viewers is by making something that

914
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:03,950
landed somewhere on those way exactly

915
00:36:00,799 --> 00:36:05,809
yeah and now they're gone no but all

916
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:07,040
right it's funny cuz there was so a bit

917
00:36:05,809 --> 00:36:09,710
of like competition

918
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,170
but like I think like the first time I

919
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:14,150
met you was YouTube live yeah and even

920
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:19,069
deep I just am I gonna met everyone even

921
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:23,480
keV all you guys so 2007 I think or nine

922
00:36:19,069 --> 00:36:33,470
I was in college dirty and that's Bo

923
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:36,770
Burnham is kind of shy awkward but like

00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:38,930
super talented so yeah he's awesome

925
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:41,420
yeah but then like we met everyone and

926
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:43,040
everyone was like super nice it was such

927
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,780
a different feeling cuz I just went to

928
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,210
VidCon yeah the first time in like eight

929
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:49,160
years yeah and this is even before the

930
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:51,170
first VidCon I know it's such a

931
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,880
different feeling like when we that

932
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:53,660
first Youtube live when everyone met up

933
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,599
I was just like

934
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:58,789
this is like a sense of like like family

935
00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:01,549
it was family everybody yeah everybody

936
00:36:58,789 --> 00:37:03,980
was so nice and like welcoming inside

937
00:37:01,549 --> 00:37:06,170
yeah oh I think I review yeah definitely

938
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:08,000
seen you before yeah like it was such a

939
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:09,829
nice feeling now I mean not to say that

940
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,690
people aren't nice but it doesn't have

941
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:14,240
there's so many people and new people

942
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:15,380
that yeah it feels a little it does it

943
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,700
feels different it's not it's not that

944
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:18,770
we're expecting it feels very

945
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:20,569
disconnected people know how to network

946
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:23,210
now and it'll exactly we're almost

947
00:37:20,569 --> 00:37:25,430
trained to networking yeah so they meet

948
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:27,920
you and they talk in a very specific way

949
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:28,970
and you know it's you know it's a

950
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,260
rehearsed thing that they say to

951
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:32,240
everyone yeah and the tone of their

952
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:34,400
voice was like oh hey oh my god yeah so

953
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,630
nice and but it's like not Daniel

954
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,760
genuine it's like you're actually

955
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:39,140
connecting in any real way right but I

956
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,880
don't think people realize that it's

957
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:42,440
weird cuz it's so common I would assume

958
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,390
it's common now because I haven't been

959
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,980
to one of those convinced that was my

960
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:48,319
first time to anything in like a long

961
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:49,150
time yeah I was like wow this is so

962
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:51,799
weird

963
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:54,170
different wasn't overwhelming it was it

964
00:37:51,799 --> 00:37:56,539
was and it made me feel really old

965
00:37:54,170 --> 00:38:00,049
because I grew up watching you and

966
00:37:56,539 --> 00:38:07,250
they're like huge now got three million

967
00:38:00,049 --> 00:38:08,720
yeah you're like 25 people saying I wash

968
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:11,809
you in elementary school and they're

969
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:14,059
like like eighteen year like adults yeah

970
00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:16,839
yeah yeah it's it's crazy yeah I

971
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:19,849
actually interviewed a joanne acedia and

972
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:22,069
she is 19 and I realized that she was

973
00:38:19,849 --> 00:38:28,309
four years old when I started uploading

974
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:30,170
a new content to YouTube while yes so

975
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:32,660
another question I don't know if it's

976
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:33,559
too personal but I'm curious right well

977
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:38,029
I think a lot of people are curious

978
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:38,750
about hmm how do you as a large youtuber

979
00:38:38,029 --> 00:38:42,410
mm-hmm

980
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:44,829
when you're dating mm-hmm just talk

981
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:44,829
about that

982
00:38:50,329 --> 00:39:09,059
you're like oh hey dating is um it's a

983
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:10,890
confusing landscape to be in just

984
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:13,980
because you never know what people's

985
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:15,869
intentions are I have a personal fear of

986
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:18,140
being cancelled and for some reason in

987
00:39:15,869 --> 00:39:21,690
my head I think that someone is gonna

988
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:23,220
set me up in some way so I'm like okay

989
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:24,960
so someone yeah I'm like I'm like

990
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,849
there's gonna be some crazy reporter

991
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,730
that's gonna go undercover and date me

992
00:39:26,849 --> 00:39:31,380
and then they're gonna like try to get

993
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:33,540
me to say something I don't know why I

994
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:36,599
like I have these weird irrational yes

995
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:38,430
so it's it's complicated I actually kind

996
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:40,500
of remember that about you there was a

997
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:42,180
couple irrational fears no yeah he

998
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,430
mentioned something else in the past too

999
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:46,319
that you what I don't remember what is

1000
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:50,670
some kind of eggs aiya tea anxiety thing

1001
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:52,619
I have intense anxiety right and I had

1002
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:53,609
panic attacks for very long so maybe

1003
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:55,980
that's the thing I'm trying to remember

1004
00:39:53,609 --> 00:39:57,299
maybe what triggered that um what

1005
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:00,210
triggered panic attacks or what what

1006
00:39:57,299 --> 00:40:03,540
triggers it for you now it's just

1007
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:06,270
feeling completely overwhelmed it

1008
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:08,819
happens a lot less frequently now the

1009
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:10,770
last time I had a last time I had a

1010
00:40:08,819 --> 00:40:13,770
panic attack was I was about to karaoke

1011
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:15,660
with a bunch of people that I I didn't

1012
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:17,640
really want to hang with but I had

1013
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:19,170
agreed to do it and I was like I'm gonna

1014
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,760
have to sing in front of these people I

1015
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:22,170
don't even want to hang out with them

1016
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,819
and that was enough that was enough to

1017
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:26,130
do it for me oh really

1018
00:40:23,819 --> 00:40:29,520
but for the most part it's it's a fear

1019
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:32,549
of fear that's what a panic attack

1020
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:35,849
really is so it's because you start

1021
00:40:32,549 --> 00:40:37,470
getting anxiety and then anxieties

1022
00:40:35,849 --> 00:40:38,760
anxiety everyone feels anxiety but then

1023
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:41,339
it really starts spiraling out of

1024
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,660
control when you start getting when it

1025
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:45,180
starts building on itself you start to

1026
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:46,470
feel fear and you say oh I'm about to

1027
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:49,049
get a panic attack and you're like oh

1028
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:50,520
just business this is this thing this is

1029
00:40:49,049 --> 00:40:51,869
gonna be such a terrible situation this

1030
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:54,329
is not the right place to get one and

1031
00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:56,339
then you start going bigger and bigger

1032
00:40:54,329 --> 00:40:57,359
and bigger with the way that you feel

1033
00:40:56,339 --> 00:40:58,890
like your whole world is crushing down

1034
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,390
it's gonna be the worst thing ever and

1035
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:02,910
then it becomes that because you have

1036
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:03,510
that fear mm-hmm and did a going to

1037
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:05,130
therapy

1038
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:07,080
is that when all of it kind of changed

1039
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:09,030
where didn't happen way less I don't

1040
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:11,160
know if that I don't know if that did

1041
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:12,630
maybe but a big thing that helped me

1042
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,920
back in the day get get over because I

1043
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:16,860
was having panic attacks multiple times

1044
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,120
a day for a while and I think what

1045
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:20,550
really helped me get over that was I

1046
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:22,260
read some article online about it and

1047
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:23,730
they said no they explained about how

1048
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,810
it's just the fear of having a panic

1049
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:27,240
attack that gives you a panic attack

1050
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:27,810
which is a really weird thing to read

1051
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,480
I'm like what

1052
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:32,700
that doesn't make sense and then they

1053
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,030
mentioned that it's the fear of being

1054
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:39,300
out of control so they mentioned also

1055
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:40,680
that it be very difficult to give

1056
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,850
yourself a panic attack because you'd

1057
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,710
feel like you're in control of giving

1058
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:45,660
yourself a panic attack so I sat down

1059
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:48,810
and tried to give myself one and I

1060
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:51,990
wasn't able to get one and I realized it

1061
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:53,640
was because it was the fear that was

1062
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:55,230
causing it and then I felt more in

1063
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,280
control of it and that helps me that

1064
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:57,780
that didn't get over that's a good

1065
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,940
advice for people who have panic attacks

1066
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:01,080
try and give it to yourself it's also

1067
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,400
scary though because some people might

1068
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,930
not be ready for that you have to really

1069
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:10,410
be ready for that because okay we don't

1070
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:12,660
want to give advice anyway this is

1071
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:13,950
Anthony's experience I do remember you

1072
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,060
mention it well I don't know if it was

1073
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:19,250
that specifically but I remember

1074
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:21,330
something like that my mom or phobic and

1075
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:24,270
for the dumb people like me was that

1076
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:26,610
mean that means that she has she has a

1077
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:28,650
very she gets panic attacks all the time

1078
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:31,620
and an intense fear of not being in

1079
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:34,140
control as well and that's kind of made

1080
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:35,400
her reside only within the boundaries of

1081
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:38,090
the house because that's where she feels

1082
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:40,470
most comfortable so do you feel like

1083
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:41,910
learning more about yourself and how to

1084
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:44,610
deal with the the panic attacks that

1085
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:46,830
you've learned to kind of like let go in

1086
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:49,260
a way are you holding on more tight and

1087
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:52,790
a little bit doing that now and it's

1088
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:57,420
helped me let go a little bit more and

1089
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:58,650
I've become more comfortable knowing

1090
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:01,890
that something that makes me

1091
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:04,260
uncomfortable may happen because I'm I'm

1092
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:06,030
just I don't know I don't know why I'm

1093
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:08,160
just like if it happens it happens and

1094
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:11,610
that's really helped me do you do you

1095
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,860
feel that what you were feeling with the

1096
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:16,590
anxiety and panic attacks had to do in

1097
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:17,610
part with you becoming very famous at an

1098
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:22,290
early age

1099
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:26,010
oh maybe but I think most of it was that

1100
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:29,190
I I feel like it might have happened

1101
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:31,410
regardless if it wasn't if it wasn't you

1102
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:33,780
know cuz maybe it was from the fear and

1103
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:37,140
anxiety that I felt around maintaining

1104
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:38,910
this status of you know whatever I was

1105
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,960
like number one most subscribed at the

1106
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:41,430
time when I was getting I don't know

1107
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,420
it's like 2009 or something when it

1108
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:44,760
really started happening pretty

1109
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:46,260
intensely for me and I was up there on

1110
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,610
the top maybe that's why you know I had

1111
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,900
a lot of anxiety about that but I feel

1112
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:50,940
like if it wasn't that then it would

1113
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:53,580
have been anxiety about my finances or

1114
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:54,600
something because I grew up without much

1115
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,830
money and I felt like I would have been

1116
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,810
stuck in that and I would have probably

1117
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:59,010
been really stressed about that as well

1118
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:00,540
I think it's great that you're talking

1119
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:03,270
about this right now because there are

1120
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:05,520
so many more than ever young kids who

1121
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:07,830
are getting super famous like on tik-tok

1122
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:10,020
like I'm at VidCon you see these little

1123
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:13,140
kid these 12 year old left 10 year old

1124
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:14,910
kids who have millions of fans and they

1125
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:16,770
don't know how to deal with theirs know

1126
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:19,430
I always say this there's no book or

1127
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:22,980
therapy book on how to become famous

1128
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:24,270
yeah there's there's no right well

1129
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:25,500
there's probably a right way to do it

1130
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:26,550
but there's there's no one that will

1131
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,440
teach you how to do it you just have to

1132
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:31,050
navigate that I feel like I feel like I

1133
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:35,550
was fortunate enough to blow up in a

1134
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:37,710
time where the general public didn't pay

1135
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:39,330
attention so I was able to still go

1136
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:40,590
right to the store I was able to still

1137
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:43,740
do whatever you know I don't feel like

1138
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:45,990
people like Jeffrey star or James

1139
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:49,380
Charles can go to any store without

1140
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:52,350
having mobs of people be excited to see

1141
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:56,280
them and I feel like yeah I was number

1142
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:57,420
one most subscribed at a time where you

1143
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,250
were able to be a little bit more

1144
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:01,680
incognito and I was I'm glad that I was

1145
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:04,500
able to kind of warm up to it and write

1146
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:06,750
figure things out but if I were to go

1147
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:08,640
from zero to a hundred now if I were to

1148
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:10,980
become number one most subscribed now

1149
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,840
going from yesterday not having you know

1150
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:15,050
any following it would be completely

1151
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:19,050
overwhelming and I would probably feel

1152
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:20,340
burnout and fear and like all these

1153
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:22,860
things that would probably made me pull

1154
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:25,830
away from it III think majore like I

1155
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:28,890
wouldn't recommend I don't know at what

1156
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:31,290
age but like people who are I'm gonna

1157
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:33,869
say at least fifty

1158
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:36,000
like you have to these people who are

1159
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:38,040
under the age of like I don't even know

1160
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,690
what the exact number is but kids kids

1161
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:42,000
becoming famous I don't think it's good

1162
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:44,460
for them and any kid I mean look at look

1163
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,339
at every single like Disney star back in

1164
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:48,960
the day yeah Macaulay Culkin Macaulay

1165
00:45:47,339 --> 00:45:52,050
well they all go through some kind of

1166
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:54,210
phase some of them making out okay a lot

1167
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:56,819
of them end up really messed up Miley

1168
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:58,230
Cyrus Miley Cyrus I mean a lot of people

1169
00:45:56,819 --> 00:45:58,619
and and she kind of turned it around a

1170
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:00,150
little bit

1171
00:45:58,619 --> 00:46:02,339
right but everybody goes through that

1172
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:04,319
phase and and it's it's bound to happen

1173
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:05,700
yeah and a lot of it stems from like

1174
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:07,589
they're on top of the world at one point

1175
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,760
and you grew up with that becoming your

1176
00:46:07,589 --> 00:46:11,369
normal right

1177
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:15,270
can you imagine thinking that your whole

1178
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:18,420
normal is this Fame that you have as a

1179
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:21,000
ten-year-old and then or whatever even

1180
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:22,980
younger and then you know reality hits

1181
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,569
you when your knee goes well and that

1182
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:26,640
that fame is gone or you don't have

1183
00:46:24,569 --> 00:46:28,290
people mentoring you in the same way and

1184
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:31,109
would you treat you differently people

1185
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:33,359
treat you differently yeah and I'm sure

1186
00:46:31,109 --> 00:46:35,780
part of feeling like a has-been probably

1187
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:37,680
really does that to you and that only

1188
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:40,049
applies to certain people I'm not saying

1189
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:43,140
the people you mentioned and then also

1190
00:46:40,049 --> 00:46:45,390
just having it's almost like a lot of

1191
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:47,750
power to do whatever you want and then

1192
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:51,720
not knowing what to do with that mm-hmm

1193
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:53,430
it's it's uh like I think the only way

1194
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:57,599
you can really survive the Hat is having

1195
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:59,369
like really really tight circles and

1196
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,829
having it making sure those people in

1197
00:46:59,369 --> 00:47:03,930
that circle know how to educate you on

1198
00:47:01,829 --> 00:47:06,390
that a support system yeah it's I mean

1199
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:09,089
cuz it happens it happens to I mean even

1200
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:10,530
for me like having like different stages

1201
00:47:09,089 --> 00:47:12,150
of like thinking I'm more important than

1202
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:14,520
I am and then going to the stage of like

1203
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:16,440
wait up wait no this doesn't mean

1204
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,329
anything like and it's and then seen

1205
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:20,099
them like becoming number one and then

1206
00:47:18,329 --> 00:47:22,380
becoming number two in like going to

1207
00:47:20,099 --> 00:47:23,970
that psychology as a kid is different

1208
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:25,589
like maybe now cuz we've been in in it

1209
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:28,950
for so long it doesn't really mean much

1210
00:47:25,589 --> 00:47:30,450
but as a kid and now we're older kids at

1211
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:31,799
the time right yeah yeah only happier

1212
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:33,480
like really but imagine like a

1213
00:47:31,799 --> 00:47:34,589
twelve-year-old if when you were 12 and

1214
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:36,150
that happens soon you're like the

1215
00:47:34,589 --> 00:47:38,309
biggest thing in the world you see

1216
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:39,869
yourself a certain way you don't realize

1217
00:47:38,309 --> 00:47:42,990
like when that gets taken away from you

1218
00:47:39,869 --> 00:47:44,380
and it will it's you got to go through

1219
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:45,789
that psyche like something's

1220
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:47,920
gonna happen there like it's not a good

1221
00:47:45,789 --> 00:47:49,329
combo unless you have like the best head

1222
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,220
on your shoulders right right which can

1223
00:47:49,329 --> 00:47:52,720
only be provided by a support system of

1224
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:54,309
probably older right which is really

1225
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,809
like when you're at the top of the world

1226
00:47:54,309 --> 00:47:58,059
whoo yeah you gotta imagine the people

1227
00:47:55,809 --> 00:47:59,710
around you people circulating towards

1228
00:47:58,059 --> 00:48:01,420
you oh yeah you know positive

1229
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,440
reinforcement yeah things you don't

1230
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:05,619
necessarily deserve

1231
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:07,089
who was your in like your circle like

1232
00:48:05,619 --> 00:48:09,250
who are your mentors and people that

1233
00:48:07,089 --> 00:48:11,019
kind of kept you in check is you you

1234
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:13,779
seem all right right now like I don't

1235
00:48:11,019 --> 00:48:16,059
see I don't know I found it person I

1236
00:48:13,779 --> 00:48:17,890
don't think I really had any back then

1237
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:19,599
but it was different you know I wasn't a

1238
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:24,970
Macaulay Culkin you know it was whose

1239
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:27,640
youtube and it was weren't so much under

1240
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:29,619
a microscope as it is now yeah I also I

1241
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,390
wasn't going out I wasn't super social I

1242
00:48:29,619 --> 00:48:33,339
wasn't going out to parties where people

1243
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:35,619
worshipped me or something like that you

1244
00:48:33,339 --> 00:48:38,049
know and I was I was also I feel like I

1245
00:48:35,619 --> 00:48:41,109
stayed pretty humble I think part of it

1246
00:48:38,049 --> 00:48:43,809
was that I felt like I was not deserving

1247
00:48:41,109 --> 00:48:45,730
of anything that I had so I feel like

1248
00:48:43,809 --> 00:48:47,049
that helped me not get into into my head

1249
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:48,789
and I still feel like that you sometimes

1250
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:50,109
you know I learned that it's imposter

1251
00:48:48,789 --> 00:48:52,660
syndrome which is a real thing where you

1252
00:48:50,109 --> 00:48:53,769
feel like you don't deserve whatever it

1253
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:56,220
is that you have and assume people are

1254
00:48:53,769 --> 00:48:58,059
gonna find out that you're a fraud and

1255
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:00,029
you've been faking it this whole time

1256
00:48:58,059 --> 00:49:02,589
that's the only reason people like you

1257
00:49:00,029 --> 00:49:07,839
but I've always had that and I think

1258
00:49:02,589 --> 00:49:09,910
that as bad as that feels to have to

1259
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:11,619
think of yourself that way it it's it

1260
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:13,180
helped me where do you think what do you

1261
00:49:11,619 --> 00:49:15,400
think that feeling came from of you

1262
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:20,500
feeling like you're not really worthy of

1263
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:23,349
all of these great successes I don't

1264
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:25,329
know I feel like bringing maybe I don't

1265
00:49:23,349 --> 00:49:27,640
know let me know part of it maybe was

1266
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:29,049
that I was just like I'm just lucky you

1267
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,240
know I always just told myself I was

1268
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,660
lucky and I don't I can't say where that

1269
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,069
came from

1270
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:34,690
maybe it was my parents thing maybe my

1271
00:49:33,069 --> 00:49:36,430
parents are great at that man I think

1272
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:38,380
that's I mean like even for me I felt

1273
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:39,519
the same thing yeah like I mean

1274
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:41,920
obviously there's a lot of work that

1275
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:44,200
goes into which you I'm sure can admit

1276
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:47,349
to as well yeah but a lot of it's luck

1277
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:50,339
right and I think that's the same case

1278
00:49:47,349 --> 00:49:52,960
for everyone to a certain degree right

1279
00:49:50,339 --> 00:49:55,420
and there's like a there's actually a

1280
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,540
lot of people who are very successful

1281
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:59,609
that have the

1282
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:01,740
imposter syndrome hmm and the reason why

1283
00:49:59,609 --> 00:50:04,350
it's a real thing yeah yeah oh the

1284
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:06,210
opposite is Dunning Creek Kruger oh I

1285
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:08,040
don't know what that is it's the it's

1286
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:10,260
where somebody feels like they know a

1287
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:11,400
lot they don't know that much so it's

1288
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,930
the opposite of them ha

1289
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,310
it's like they're deserving of

1290
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:15,900
everything yeah and they're like I'm

1291
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:18,810
very smart so it's people who like talk

1292
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:20,970
a lot but aren't well informed yeah so

1293
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:25,560
okay I've met someone like that reason

1294
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:28,170
exactly okay you know a lot of people

1295
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:29,430
who are very successful well not a lot

1296
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:31,380
you know the people that are successful

1297
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:32,609
and had the impostor syndrome the reason

1298
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:33,780
why they do Wells because they don't

1299
00:50:32,609 --> 00:50:36,300
feel like they deserve it so they're

1300
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:38,580
constantly working to try and get that

1301
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:40,470
feeling like I deserve it right that's

1302
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:42,420
true it is a struggle though because I

1303
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:46,230
feel like I'm constantly proving myself

1304
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:48,330
to who knows who but right yeah never

1305
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:51,540
never really satisfied in the sense that

1306
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:52,890
I I feel like ooh I did it yeah I think

1307
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:55,230
I did this I think that's good because

1308
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:57,900
as long as you don't feel that there's

1309
00:50:55,230 --> 00:51:00,780
more in life to accomplish more to look

1310
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:02,310
forward to and build towards yeah yeah

1311
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:03,510
but like then I think about that makes

1312
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:06,770
me think about like like Floyd

1313
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:10,800
Mayweather right like he's great he's

1314
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:14,130
greatness in boxing and he's he's all

1315
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:16,950
about him like I did this and but he's

1316
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:17,760
still great you know I mean like I I'm

1317
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:19,230
your biggest fan

1318
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,940
that's why I'm saying I unless some of

1319
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:22,800
the best athletes like Michael Jordan

1320
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:25,109
yeah Kobe Bryant like not saying that

1321
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,910
they're saying you know oh I got lucky

1322
00:51:25,109 --> 00:51:28,619
they're like I did this I feel like it's

1323
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:30,390
a happy middle ground right yeah like

1324
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:33,600
they've had aware that you earned it

1325
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:34,920
they to me I think their personalities

1326
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:37,230
are not normal I think they have

1327
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:38,220
something wrong with their breasts no

1328
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:39,390
really I just really think that

1329
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:41,730
something's wrong with them but that's

1330
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:43,619
why they're so great yeah like you have

1331
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:46,109
some kind of issues I mean if you think

1332
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:48,990
about what Kanye says if Kanye said what

1333
00:51:46,109 --> 00:51:50,880
he said without his accomplishment he'd

1334
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:52,530
be wearing different types of sweaters

1335
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,860
can you imagine if Kanye had impostor

1336
00:51:52,530 --> 00:52:00,480
syndrome

1337
00:51:53,860 --> 00:52:04,410
[Laughter]

1338
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:06,210
like him yeah I would there is something

1339
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:07,320
likeable about that my dark disadvantage

1340
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:11,190
he would be a completely different

1341
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:13,800
meaning yes what would you be doing if

1342
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:16,589
YouTube disappeared tomorrow if it

1343
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:20,190
disappeared tomorrow I think um change

1344
00:52:16,589 --> 00:52:25,170
platform mixer let's say social media

1345
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:30,839
disappeared hard I was boring it is I I

1346
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:33,450
just went to to a retreat where for one

1347
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:35,910
whole week Monday through Friday there

1348
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:38,609
was no internet reception my entire

1349
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:40,170
premises and I did that right after

1350
00:52:38,609 --> 00:52:44,730
VidCon I knew I was gonna need it I was

1351
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:47,040
like I got a detox from this I and I it

1352
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:48,589
was the longest I ever went without just

1353
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:52,050
having some kind of technology

1354
00:52:48,589 --> 00:52:56,040
accessible it always descends it was up

1355
00:52:52,050 --> 00:53:01,380
north in Northern California yeah it

1356
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:02,790
felt so good yes the first three days I

1357
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:04,109
think I'd be miserable in first three

1358
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:05,700
days I was reaching for my phone like

1359
00:53:04,109 --> 00:53:08,069
okay I got a look at that video see how

1360
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:09,480
I people liked my video I posted because

1361
00:53:08,069 --> 00:53:13,589
I posted it right as I was driving out

1362
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:14,609
of the reception I was like did I say

1363
00:53:13,589 --> 00:53:15,960
something the video that people are

1364
00:53:14,609 --> 00:53:20,190
going to notice and then I'm not gonna

1365
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:22,650
be there to remove it but and we have

1366
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:24,270
the same thought just really yeah so

1367
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:26,910
you're not to your degree but yeah it's

1368
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:30,000
pretty bad for me but it is cool to know

1369
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:31,859
that that's that's go through that yeah

1370
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,599
so for the first three days or so but

1371
00:53:31,859 --> 00:53:36,750
but the last two days it felt really

1372
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:40,710
nice to not look down at my phone and

1373
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:42,960
and also not waste time on social media

1374
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:44,970
because that's that is most of what I do

1375
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:47,700
on social media is just waste time and

1376
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:50,670
fill gaps I'm like if I if I'm walking

1377
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:53,550
up a set of stairs I'm like well that's

1378
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:55,650
kind of boring we've got my Instagram or

1379
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:58,859
like I'm like out of urine home like

1380
00:53:55,650 --> 00:54:01,230
well you know I got 15 seconds at most

1381
00:53:58,859 --> 00:54:03,150
what about when you looked oh yeah

1382
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:06,869
that's one of the worst for me like I

1383
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:09,420
know it's a habit but laughs it feels so

1384
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:11,520
boring now I remember without I remember

1385
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:13,310
looking at the wallpaper and coming up

1386
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:16,250
with that looks like yeah

1387
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:18,680
kids and I don't even do that anymore

1388
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:20,810
yeah but how was that it's great it was

1389
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:26,300
great was pooping pooping was great hey

1390
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:27,470
I was like I was a present pooper but

1391
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:30,680
don't bring their phone into the

1392
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:35,930
bathroom really just took everything in

1393
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:37,790
yeah let it all out at the same time it

1394
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:39,650
was the whole experience was very nice

1395
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:41,570
and it gave me a little bit of

1396
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:43,300
perspective and I brought a journal and

1397
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:46,430
I wrote down the ways that I felt and I

1398
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:47,840
documented it in that sense and I just

1399
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:49,070
referred to it I was like oh that's

1400
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:51,560
really nice that's a it's a nice

1401
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:53,900
reminder I wrote down how much I don't

1402
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:56,810
like looking at my stats and how much I

1403
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:58,099
felt really good not looking at social

1404
00:54:56,810 --> 00:55:00,410
media and feeling like I constantly had

1405
00:54:58,099 --> 00:55:01,970
to be in the know and you know looking

1406
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:03,500
at the news just because I had to be in

1407
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:06,109
the know like that stuff doesn't

1408
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:08,900
actually matter as much as I saw a

1409
00:55:06,109 --> 00:55:11,300
challenge the five day no but you know I

1410
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:12,290
but then that does goes like it there's

1411
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:14,330
some meaning behind it

1412
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:17,720
yeah the challenge that has meaning it

1413
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:23,150
is that day no technology challenge but

1414
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:24,890
then how are they document that sure it

1415
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:26,599
does defeat the purpose because people

1416
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:29,240
only one talking I spent a day without

1417
00:55:26,599 --> 00:55:31,160
my phone who thought about doing the

1418
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,510
video I spent today with people with

1419
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,920
that don't have cell phones or something

1420
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:35,690
that's like that's really not that

1421
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:39,710
interesting actually they just walk

1422
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:42,320
around it may have life and read a great

1423
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:48,950
experience to people without their phone

1424
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:51,530
are generally a little bit happier yeah

1425
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:52,550
cuz you you have your phone on you cuz

1426
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:54,349
you constantly wanna be connected to

1427
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:56,000
everything but there's a lot of distress

1428
00:55:54,349 --> 00:55:57,920
that that you're connected to constant

1429
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,510
that things happening in the world or

1430
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:02,089
that stress of feeling like you need to

1431
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:04,310
keep up to date and post stuff or

1432
00:56:02,089 --> 00:56:05,359
whatever you know you said earlier to me

1433
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:06,859
that you feel pressure to post on

1434
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:08,900
Instagram and when I didn't have my

1435
00:56:06,859 --> 00:56:11,570
phone at all I didn't feel any pressure

1436
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:14,000
right it's a post or anything to keep up

1437
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:15,619
no way it's almost like like your phone

1438
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,690
is a shovel and you're constantly

1439
00:56:15,619 --> 00:56:20,780
digging to find more and more and then

1440
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:22,460
digger you deep the more like in a hole

1441
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:24,500
you feel and you're like why can't I

1442
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:25,790
can't stop I can't get out and you're

1443
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,420
you keep thinking thinking maybe I'll

1444
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:27,829
find ya

1445
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:29,359
down here yeah maybe there's something

1446
00:56:27,829 --> 00:56:30,410
good that'll make me feel good down here

1447
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:33,049
but you're also finding a lot of stuff

1448
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:34,430
that makes you really feel not good or

1449
00:56:33,049 --> 00:56:35,089
makes you just kind of feel like a

1450
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:38,000
little bit crazy

1451
00:56:35,089 --> 00:56:39,410
yeah more often than not yes once in a

1452
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,750
while you'll find a nice doll oh yeah

1453
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:43,910
yeah I mean it's like it's like looking

1454
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:46,130
at YouTube comments incessantly and

1455
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:47,270
you're like look at that one look and

1456
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:48,680
then every once awhile you get that bad

1457
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:51,049

1459
00:56:51,049 --> 00:56:55,880
right like you're almost looking here

1460
00:56:54,049 --> 00:57:08,329
OMA you almost want to make sure there's

1461
00:56:55,880 --> 00:57:09,440
none there by looking for them right so

1462
00:57:08,329 --> 00:57:11,119

00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:15,079

hanging out I mean it's almost nice

1467
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:31,520

right environment to talk about some

1474
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:50,089
