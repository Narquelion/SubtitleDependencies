1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,220
warning the following videos very

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,330
serious and based on true events it is

3
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,589
in no way super for men to be funny

4
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,940
comedic or taken as a joke however I

5
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,170
didn't take my ADHD medication before I

6
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,069
started filming editing this video which

7
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,970
may cause this video to seem less

8
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:10,349
serious and more confusing and

9
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,019
invisibles to be viewer discretion is a

10
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:15,719
word we are good to go first vlog of the

11
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,920
year and I well that's what I'm supposed

12
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:19,560
to do today I'll supposed to cut my hair

13
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,939
like so poofy on so this video was

14
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,109
supposed to be the first video of the

15
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:23,400
year but as most of you know I fell

16
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:27,140
about 3 weeks behind schedule because

17
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:30,449
the last video took over a month to me

18
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,740
never ever doing that many effects in a

19
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,090
video ever you'll probably do another

20
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,500
one but I wanted to start the year with

21
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,309
something a little more personal and

22
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,390
today I'm gonna be talking about

23
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:38,399
something that I've never really said

24
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,960
publicly and it's something no one other

25
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,250
than my closest friends and some family

26
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,600
know but first let me start off by

27
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,469
saying my new year's resolutions this

28
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,750
year were pretty much your typical

29
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:47,460
resolutions exercising more and dieting

30
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,899
baby more mature the main one was I was

31
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,579
gonna keep making YouTube videos without

32
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,960
having to sacrifice my health most of

33
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,610
the time really goes into write I read

34
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,870
them all on my laptop in my phone but if

35
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,039
I were to print them on a paper the

36
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:00,030
stack would probably look something like

37
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,590
this ya know I didn't sell too many

38
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,510
scheme' whose back in all night I don't

39
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,710
even make like 99% of these ideas cuz

40
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,119
most of them make absolutely no sense

41
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,270
out of all these there's probably only a

42
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,310
few worth filming like Dragon Ball Z

43
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,200
fight in real life what a great idea

44
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,880
that doesn't sound overly time-consuming

45
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,930
difficult and all-around stressful to do

46
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,970
at all

47
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:22,619
ducking dragon I don't want to pick that

48
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:26,369
all up so I'm not gonna push it but you

49
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:27,750
know how mad I am anyway as fun as it is

50
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:28,920
and looking the behind the scenes and

51
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,970
whatnot you know just trying to keep up

52
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,159
with everything last year I was skipping

53
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,950
meals losing sleep feeling exhausted all

54
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,500
day and I ended up developing what was a

55
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,670
minor addiction I don't know where these

56
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,260
feelings come from or what they mean

57
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:44,200
but there's just something about doing

58
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:46,810
crystal meth finding the smallest animal

59
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,690
you can find and just strangling up to

60
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:51,610
just give you that rush you know yeah

61
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:59,259
doing a lot better this week thank you

62
00:01:51,610 --> 00:02:04,090

name is Ryan and why Ryan hi then over

64
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:12,060
the years I kind of developed an

65
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:12,060
addiction to energy drinks and caffeine

66
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:17,500
why freaking kidding me man

67
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,220

00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,769
for fun

69
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,230
you see Wes over there he hooks up in IV

70
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:24,820
when he sleeps so he can drink alcohol

71
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,170
24/7 ted shoots up heroin just because

72
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,820
he loves the movie Twilight that much

73
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:30,280
you're like my own personal brand of

74
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,989
Bella and Phil I don't even want to tell

75
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,310
you what he's still just what is he I

76
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:38,350
still on MySpace Oh where'd you go see

77
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,670
you see these these are real problems

78
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:42,519
why don't you come back to this cutaway

79
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:44,200
when you have a real addiction no no

80
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:45,910
don't strangle him what no I wasn't

81
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,140
going to do that this is my dog he's

82
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:50,380
only here because he's addicted to

83
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:52,420
making immature people laugh what yeah I

84
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,620
don't know why I kept going with that

85
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,910
that was supposed to be a quick cutaway

86
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,560
anyway okay yeah it's not like I'm

87
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,000
addicted to anything crazy like crack

88
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,440
crystal meth though I did just start

89
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,910
getting into Breaking Bad and crystal

90
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,100
meth does look kind of interest now on

91
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:06,459
this on a joke do not ever do meth kids

92
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,660
they're not even once yes that long

93
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:09,250
cutaway was supposed to be a joke but

94
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,200
caffeine addiction is a real problem

95
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:13,269
it's a real thing and so was my space

96
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,610
I'm a real drug addict yes caffeine is

97
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:17,170
legal but it is a drug I think is it a

98
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,120
drug see I wouldn't know because I

99
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:22,269
didn't graduate college because of the

100
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,200
caffeine caffeine not even okay I didn't

101
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,970
graduate because I wanted to make

102
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,470
youtube videos making YouTube videos is

103
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,620
what led to the caffeine so you could

104
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:32,170
say that YouTube is a gateway drug

105
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:34,120
YouTube is a gateway drug YouTube the

106
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,650
gateway to caffeinated meth but

107
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,480
seriously the caffeine thing got pretty

108
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,070
bad last year I was literally drinking

109
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,269
about four Red Bulls every single day we

110
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,410
were filming the candy Chris video last

111
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:43,180
year which by the way if you watched

112
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,980
that video again and replace candy crush

113
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,109
with caffeine that's actually what I was

114
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,670
really talking about curse symbolism I

115
00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:50,380
don't even know simple

116
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,330
zone is the right term because I didn't

117
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,860
graduate college because of the caffeine

118
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,599
but during that shoot I remember I was

119
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,040
so exhausted and burnt out just to

120
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,630
finish it up basically I ended up

121
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,890
drinking nine rebels in one day and that

122
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,480
night I ended up crashing from all the

123
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,760
rebels but I woke up like an hour later

124
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,830
with my hand like trembling and my chest

125
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,780
was like in so much pain and I knew I

126
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,580
had to stop drinking so much caffeine or

127
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,020
at least cut down so I told myself after

128
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,450
the last min of the year which as you

129
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,890
guys know is that one ahh I just need to

130
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,419
take a break from YouTube so I could

131
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,470
just stop drinking energy drinks for

132
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:18,700
like a month or so because I was

133
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,590
starting to get worried that I was

134
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,450
addicted to energy drinks which I didn't

135
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,590
think was possible before so why am I

136
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,210
telling you guys all this I know a lot

137
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,500
of you guys are younger than me and you

138
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,970
know when I was younger in high school

139
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,010
in college I was surrounded by people

140
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,210
that did drugs and I never did so that's

141
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,350
why I thought addiction could never

142
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,180
happen to me because I thought I won't

143
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,410
happen to weak minded druggies I guess

144
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,419
what I'm trying to say is that for all

145
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,590
you innocent kids out there you're gonna

146
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:40,270
be addicted to drugs

147
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,190
just kidding sorry this is a serious

148
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:44,410
topic addiction can happen to anyone so

149
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,090
be careful in terms of me I honestly

150
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,830
still do drink energy drinks but it's

151
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,360
definitely not for a day like it used to

152
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,220
be maybe one or two at the very most

153
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,720
baby steps all about the babies people

154
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,919
always make new year's resolutions and

155
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,600
they never follow through because I

156
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,310
think once they break it or slip up

157
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,990
they just say screw it and they just let

158
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,520
it go but it's all about the baby steps

159
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,660
I don't know why this babies moonwalking

160
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,890
like if your new year's resolution was

161
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,660
to be nicer to people because you are a

162
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:06,430
dick every single day last year try and

163
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,380
be a dick every other day and then once

164
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,669
a week and then once a month and then

165
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,250
you relapse and go through this all-out

166
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:14,380
dick week and that's came out wrong so

167
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:16,090
did that never give up just take baby

168
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,440
steps because nobody likes a dick and

169
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,789
nobody wants to have an addiction

170
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,710
especially if that addiction is to being

171
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:22,630
a dick which in that case makes sense

172
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,010
because nobody likes both those things

173
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,479
that's why the word dick is in the word

174
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,010
addiction but that doesn't have to be

175
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:29,050
you you can beat that addiction you can

176
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:31,300
beat that dick yeah my other resolution

177
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:33,310
was to be more mature that's clearly

178
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,840
working Oh anyway I made this video

179
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,800
pretty much as an update at the start of

180
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,970
the year I don't know a lot you guys

181
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,380
don't even care what the personal life

182
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,789
stuff and I probably like just drink

183
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,200
