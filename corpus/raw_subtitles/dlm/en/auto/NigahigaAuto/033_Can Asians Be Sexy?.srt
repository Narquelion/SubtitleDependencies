1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,420
hey guys ah he'll start this over real

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,680
quick hey guys so by now I'm sure all of

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,660
you have already heard about all the

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,280
drama and controversy around you know

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,840
Steve Harvey making the jokes called

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,190
Asian man basically he made some jokes

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,719
on this show about Asian men and how

8
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,470
they're not attractive and this is what

9
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,910
it looked like you know thank you

10
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,500
obviously there was a lot of drama that

11
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,300
fall there was two different sides of

12
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,980
people either you know attacking Steve

13
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,990
Harvey saying he's racist for making

14
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,250
those jokes or people actually defending

15
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,900
him and saying you know he's a comedian

16
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,669
and Asians need to learn to just take a

17
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,440
joke and even though I'm Asian and I

18
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:36,989
should be biased when I really thought

19
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,340
about it I wasn't personally offended by

20
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:39,809
what he said I'm not saying what he said

21
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,579
was right I'm just saying for me

22
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:42,780
personally I don't get offended by

23
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,200
things like that I've been hearing it my

24
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,239
whole life

25
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,190
obviously I can see why agents were

26
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:48,600
offended and are upset about this and I

27
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,129
have to admit I was upset too but

28
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,960
probably for a completely different

29
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:53,760
reason I wasn't upset by the fact that

30
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,260
he was saying Asian men are unattractive

31
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,670
I was upset for just two reasons first

32
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,079
of all the double standard that exists

33
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,340
when it comes to making racist jokes

34
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,020
it's like in our society's almost okay

35
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,340
to make jokes about Asians like this I

36
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,409
mean could you imagine if we switch the

37
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,880
rows and we have an Asian man playing

38
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:07,799
Steve Harvey and said the things that he

39
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,869
said but about black people on national

40
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,170
television excuse me do you like black

41
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:14,280
men no thank you yeah I'm pretty sure

42
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,960
that Asian guy's career would be over

43
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,580
any probably getting death threats he'd

44
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,810
probably not be able to book another job

45
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,580
there would be significantly more

46
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,630
outrage than there was about this Steve

47
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,640
Harvey thing but since the joke was

48
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,140
about Asians it's not as big of a deal

49
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,549
because you know it's just a joke I mean

50
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,049
Asians are like the punch bags of

51
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:29,159
society I can understand if this was

52
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:30,420
like the first time that this ever

53
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,500
happened in mainstream media let's be

54
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,610
real these kinds of things happen to

55
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,829
Asians all the time I mean remember

56
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,509
during linsanity and ESPN wrote about

57
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:38,340
Jeremy Lin and they titled the article a

58
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:39,869
[ __ ] in the armor obviously making

59
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,189
reference to the fact that Jeremy is

60
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:42,600
Asian and yes there was a lot of outrage

61
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:44,310
for that I'm not denying that though

62
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,780
again there was no people with defending

63
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,280
the fact that it was a joke but my point

64
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,409
is the fact that anybody would actually

65
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,329
think it's okay to title an article a

66
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,460
[ __ ] in the armor when you know it's a

67
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:54,930
non comedic sports related article it's

68
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,490
kind of ridiculous I mean the word [ __ ]

69
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,899
is basically like the n-word for Asian

70
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,520
do you think anybody would dare to

71
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,990
publish the article if they switch out

72
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,820
the word [ __ ] with the n-word of course

73
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,560
not because society and mainstream media

74
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,600
has taught us that it's not okay to make

75
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,489
black jokes but it is okay to make Asian

76
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,410
joke Steve Harvey is a comedian it's his

77
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:11,819
job in fact if I had to list my favorite

78
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,120
black comedians you know from greatest

79
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,010
to worse Steve Harvey wouldn't be the

80
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,150
last one no I'd probably start the top

81
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,680
of the list with like Dave Chappelle

82
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,540
Eddie Murphy Wayne Brady

83
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,430
Hill in harness rock Chris Tucker Ronald

84
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,110
Glover Bernie Mac Martin Lauren Tracy

85
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,909
Morgan Wanda Sykes the entire Wayans

86
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,950
family makes seven up yours guy Orlando

87
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:30,280
Jones animate the godom buying Bill

88
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:32,829
Cosby Steve Harvey and then Bill Cosby

89
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,440
after the rape allegation so see Steve

90
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:36,849
is still not at the bottom cap god I

91
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,079
mean let's be real the guy's funny thing

92
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:41,250
when you got jokes that are straight

93
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:41,250
fire like this one

94
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,419
[Applause]

95
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,419
[Music]

96
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,759
[Applause]

97
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:02,340
this Chinese food is often in another

98
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:04,980
language see so sometimes they pronounce

99
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,610
things differently and what seems what

100
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,610
steeps in

101
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,779
[Applause]

102
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,319
it's good job the funniest part to me is

103
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,959
that you know as a comedian he didn't

104
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:21,700
just laugh at his own joke he was dying

105
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:23,650
from his home job and look like it was

106
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,209
the funniest joke he's ever told or her

107
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,709
then again maybe he wasn't even making a

108
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:28,120
joke I mean Chinese food is hard to

109
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:29,620
pronounce it actually made me kind of

110
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,790
curious and I started thinking like what

111
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,959
would it be like to have someone like

112
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:43,060
Steve Harvey you know at a Chinese

113
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:44,319

118
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:03,129

you're the ones because I'm black you

143
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:54,250
assume I like KFC racist that was a

144
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,110
horrible Steve Harvey impression I know

145
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,820
I apologize I know that wasn't a good

146
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,320
joke to end on either so I apologize for

147
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,750
that to say but at least I admit when I

148
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,930
have bad jokes

149
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,639
[Music]

150
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,380
well I should also say that Steve

151
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,389
actually did apologize already goes a

152
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,590
typical PR apology that no every

153
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:10,610
celebrity does when they mess up and you

154
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,470
know he doesn't really mean it because

155
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,210
you know when the backlash first started

156
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,800
coming he literally said this she kind

157
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:22,699
of beat me up on him in there right now

158
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:24,650
for no reason but but anyway overall

159
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:27,080
either Steve Harvey was making a lame

160
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,729
tasteless overused joke that Asians have

161
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,530
been hearing all their lives or he

162
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:32,240
actually meant what he said and he

163
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,889
really does believe that you know women

164
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,690
aren't attracted to Asian males it's one

165
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:37,729
or the other and we all can agree that

166
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:39,800
it was just a bad tasteless joke because

167
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:41,750
we know he's not a racist I mean he just

168
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,220
had a meeting with the President of the

169
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:47,510
United States so how can he be racist

170
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:50,060
but all jokes aside I decided to

171
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:51,289
actually do my own research and see if

172
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,030
you know maybe Steve was onto something

173
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:54,590
maybe women don't like agent man so what

174
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,060
I did is what any logical person on the

175
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:59,599
internet would do taking it to the

176
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,949
streets excuse me miss could ask you a

177
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:02,780
few questions it all in tech fine that's

178
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:04,490
gonna ask you a few simple questions my

179
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,169
first question if you had to pick

180
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:08,030
between these two individuals who would

181
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:11,479
you consider to be more attractive here

182
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:15,289
be probably be err be I'm gonna have to

183
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:17,360
go with B I would go would be what no

184
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:19,039
