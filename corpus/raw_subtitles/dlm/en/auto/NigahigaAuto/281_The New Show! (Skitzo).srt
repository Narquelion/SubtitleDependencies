34
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,520
actual pages Regina says yes there are

35
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,410
see Regina holds up scrip and reads

36
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,350
Ryan's that's not supposed to be in this

37
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:24,150
just put that down no I'm just kidding

38
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,979
you guys it actually says Regina puts

39
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,280
down script but I'm a rebel

40
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:31,020
I don't even have script I don't know

41
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,030
how to read anyway now that we're all in

42
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,619
the same I mean we all know what we're

43
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,690
talking about we all know that schizo is

44
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,890
not completely ending but I do think it

45
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,940
is time that we come up with some new

46
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,140
shows you know we got to keep this

47
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,580
channel fresh we got to come up with

48
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,050
shows that people actually want to see

49
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,690
skits like these are a thing in the past

50
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:47,759

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,300

00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,430

you to sound like in a knowing teen is

112
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,980
to make up your own trendy word just

113
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,570
like Gretchen did in the movie Mean

114
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,070
Girls even at the word fetch it was

115
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,560
completely new and completely original

116
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:05,420
most unswayed thing you can do as a teen

117
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:09,200
is to use somebody else's trend words

118
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:11,330
wag oh my god what the [ __ ]

119
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,550
make sure you make up your own original

120
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,989
word don't copy all you have to do is

121
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,340
think of a completely different word

122
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:17,840
that relates to the word that you really

123
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,400
want to say like if you see a guy who's

124
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,919
looking really cool you can say oh my

125
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,840
god that guy is so cold because cool and

126
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,990
colder like twinsies where yeah and if

127
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,669
he's hot he's hot and he's cold ya know

128
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:31,160
like God just at the Katy Perry song

129
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:33,260
Holt's cape more like cat purrs for sure

130
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,300
at parrots are like dog bark dogs are so

131
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,310
door yeah but barks are never barks or

132
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,290
like from tree likes trees have branches

133
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,940
branches are likes Ted likes dogs and

134
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:43,550
sticks do go together because when you

135
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,710
throw a stick like two bags

136
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:52,220

I mean it's definitely something else

150
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,490

183
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:08,759
poo uh oh sorry oh come on where's my

184
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,680
parents can't see them yes uh you will

185
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:13,710
be able to see them shortly but I do

186
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,409
have to inform you that we don't my

187
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:19,499
dolls can you oh this real quick thank

188
00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:21,689
you what is this sometimes we use the

189
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:23,099
dollars to explain to kids what really

190
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:25,409
happened so they're not shown I don't

191
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:26,069
need that helmet do it anyway oh um

192
00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:28,830
sorry

193
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:31,520
uh look your father we had to amputate

194
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:33,839
both of his arms and well your mother

195
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,270
coincidentally we had to amputate both

196
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,189
of her legs how happy so we actually

197
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:40,560
thought the best course of action was to

198
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:42,360
take both one arm and one leg from both

199
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,069
your mother father and sew them on each

200
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,860
other so that they both have at least

201
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:49,110
one of each what the only problem is I

202
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,759
kinda mixed up the arm in the leg during

203
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,740
the surgery what what does that even

204
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,659
mean well it means that we accidentally

205
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:59,639
sold the same leg on your father and the

206
00:07:54,659 --> 00:08:03,240
same arm on your mother so now well this

207
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,710
can't be happening it is it did mr.

208
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,089
Pooler there's actually one more thing I

209
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,279

the gaming gaming videos and again

226
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:52,030
that's not something new but gaming

227
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:54,070
videos do do pretty well yeah dude you

228
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:55,930
know my name is different from everybody

229
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:57,550
else also everybody else filmed himself

230
00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:04,650
playing game but I'm going to film

231
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:04,650
myself watching them play the game I

232
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:13,480
don't like this on attack there's

233
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,720
another good idea that's my favorite one

234
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,400
yet

235
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,690
are you serious flat you actually think

236
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,250
that's a good show why you always gotta

237
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:20,290
hate on our show ideas we're least we

238
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,850
got ideas where's yours hand it back off

239
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:24,760
I guess there's no better time than now

240
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,960
but this is my show idea what I don't

241
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,980
get it I still don't have scripts so I

242
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,260
don't know what to say for all these

243
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:33,660
years of skits love it's finally time to

244
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:36,940
reveal it feel what well the truth

245
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:40,390
that's about it just told them the truth

246
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:42,850
I mean I know you told me not to talk

247
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:44,800
back to these voices in my head but I

248
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:47,470
mean what am I gonna do I needed show

249
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,520
ideas and they had different ideas I

250
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,500
never would have thought of it's like

251
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,600
they have their own personalities like

252
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,580
that one that wanted to do a pranking

253
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,830
channel that just went way too far and

254
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:58,990
another one that came up with the gaming

255
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:00,370
reacting video which we probably can't

256
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:02,680
even do because we probably get sued for

257
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:04,330
that now the girl man I mean I'm not

258
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,700
gonna lie she probably had one of the

259
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:09,010
best ideas out of all of them but I got

260
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:13,150
a she so annoying I mean sometimes I

261
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:16,290
just want to yeah just I just I don't

262
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:19,360
know how much more I can take you know

263
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:21,220
what do you think I should do well first

264
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,080
of all just remember when you're feeling

265
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,210
these feelings just remember what I

266
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,370
always say just breathe

267
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:29,140
everything's gonna be okay secondly I

268
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,820
think you do have a flow idea I don't

269
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,650
think you need those other ideas all

270
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,390
these voices that you keep hearing

271
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:36,150
inside your head

272
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:37,500

00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,820
world so it's not the real world it is I

319
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,410
call us beta Baker's we ran with the

320
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:32,720

it's not the miracle yes

322
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:39,270
I don't like this holiday so thank you

323
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,410
again so much for watching if you want

324
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,400
to see bloopers you kinda seems to come

325
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,750
on the left you want to see the previous

326
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,010
skits of video click them on the right

327
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,420
and remember if you do click them on the

328
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:48,180
right it's you're gonna need like 30

329
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,410
minutes because it's a long video but it

330
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,210
does explain a lot of things in this

331
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:52,410
video so you probably if you didn't see

332
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:54,000
it you probably watch that one come back

333
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:56,330
to this one and then you'll be like oh I

334
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,330
get it now
