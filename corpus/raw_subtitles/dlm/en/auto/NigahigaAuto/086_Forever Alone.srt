00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,600
hey guys so it just passed that I cannot

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:08,130
open notice this very overused trend

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,870
that's all I saw about Wednesday

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,250
seriously can get it it's funny when

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,719
it's a joke but they were seriously a

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,420
lot of people who really think that

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,750
they're forever alone I don't what is

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,550
this

9
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,840
and these people are actually sat there

10
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,670
same and I don't think that's a

11
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,320
legitimate reason to be sad no one needs

12
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,550
a wiper in our girlfriend to be happy

13
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,619
and just a heads up by telling people

14
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,480
only you are you're actually repetitive

15
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,519
everything that you want self-pity is

16
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,260
not attractive to most people just smile

17
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,000
be happy maybe your next Valentine's Day

18
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,290

probably can see for every butterfly

49
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,440
my point is that yes we all want to find

50
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:10,729
that one person that we fall in love

51
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,680
with and I really do have nothing

52
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:14,000
against the forever alone - I'm just

53
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,560
saying if you're actually sad about

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,880
being single don't go posting it all

55
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,230
over the internet for everybody to see

56
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,580
that's not gonna work and if you're in

57
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,959
your teen years and younger I know a

58
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,100
boyfriend or girlfriend might seem like

59
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,380
the most important thing in the world

60
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,000
right now but trust me it's not I'm 21

61
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,650
I've been a teenager for like ten years

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,420
I know so stop worrying about being

63
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,010
alone just smile at it like - in school

64
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,370
there's a lot more fish in the sea

65
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:36,250
and remember the world is your oyster

66
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:39,440
and one day you're gonna find your pearl

67
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,370
unless if your oyster has no pearl then

68
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,510
in that case you would have to get

69
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,150
another waster which means you need

70
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:46,450
another world yeah it's not looking good

71
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,450
for you
