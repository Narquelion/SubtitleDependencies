00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
hey guys so sorry that was in a post

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,319
last week I mean other than the podcast

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,700
we've actually been pretty on point this

4
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,990
year with the posting and you know

5
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,340
especially with the podcast we haven't

6
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,480
missed a week yet that's a miracle for

7
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,849
us but anyway the reason why there was

8
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,710
no video last week was because I did not

9
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:15,000
do anything last week I was in LA and

10
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,060
this is something I never thought I

11
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,130
would be admitting on this channel but

12
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:22,920
the reason for that trip was because of

13
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,519
Valentine's Day that's right I'm not

14
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,519
single

15
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:31,990
[Music]

16
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,550
Hey what the hell are you guys doing oh

17
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,500
it's seen for you yeah we're just happy

18
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,360
for you man it's a miracle it's not a

19
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,070
miracle stop making it seem like it's so

20
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,830
hard to believe we're not yeah we're

21
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,120
just happy yeah we totally believe okay

22
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:44,650
you know what can you guys just leave

23
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,239
because this was actually supposed to be

24
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,739
a serious announcement for once and you

25
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,550
guys are turning into some kind of weird

26
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:53,860
skit joke thing oh is this not weird

27
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,000
joke no and frankly it's a little

28
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,590
insulting that you guys would assume

29
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,120
that we definitely thought it was a skit

30
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,650
yeah or some kind of trolling right

31
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,030
because like that's is you usually do

32
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,920
when it comes to relationships and stuff

33
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,660
yeah like the last time when he was

34
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,119
going to reveal his girlfriend but it

35
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:09,060
just ended up being Greg you know when I

36
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,490
saw ha because if we didn't see that

37
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,780
predictable those guys I am NOT trolling

38
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,100
and I'm not gonna make some kind of joke

39
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,750
so can you please just let me do my

40
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,729
thing is the longer we prolong this hey

41
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,920
the less serious it becomes and for once

42
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:22,330
I am trying to be open about this part

43
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,050
of my life so you're actually serious

44
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:27,910
yes so you really do have a girlfriend

45
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:30,780
yes how many times do I have to tell you

46
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,780
guys that I have a girl

47
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:37,160
yeah that was my way of saying that I'm

48
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,570
actually being serious this time Carly

49
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,640
could have just said that but you know

50
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:42,680
why not add a few more hours to filming

51
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,960
and editing pay for all those costumes

52
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,850
to look guys all jokes aside I am being

53
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,440
serious I am NOT single and I haven't

54
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,000
been for a while now believe it or not

55
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,440
and no it's not the best-kept secret in

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,210
the world I mean there's bunch of rumors

57
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,990
I just never publicly came out and said

58
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,190
it people have seen us in public

59
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,869
together we've been in pictures together

60
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,250
we took trips together because we don't

61
00:01:56,869 --> 00:01:59,660
really go out of our way to hide it

62
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,400
we just I've never announced we just

63
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,600
both decided that it'd be best for the

64
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,820
relationship at least in the beginning

65
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,380
to not say anything publicly and then we

66
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,330
just kind of continued to not announce

67
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,770
it because it's just it just became the

68
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:11,090
norm looking like a huge secret or

69
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,410
anything but since I am trying to be a

70
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,090
little bit more open and honest on this

71
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,350
channel with like you know the podcasts

72
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,730
or videos like this I felt like it'd be

73
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,650
really hard to continue to do that

74
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,209
without you know revealing anything

75
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,560
about this aspect of my life especially

76
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:22,790
because it's such a big part of and I'm

77
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,620
not trying to make this all overly

78
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:28,610
dramatic or a bigger deal than it really

79
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,750
is but with that being said I'm just

80
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:38,299
gonna get straight to the point

81
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:40,549
so no more theatrics lights I am going

82
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:44,000
to be revealing for the first time ever

83
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:51,950
my secret girlfriend of almost two

84
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:53,930
entire years three entire I will be

85
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:57,580
revealing my secret girlfriend of three

86
00:02:53,930 --> 00:03:01,070
to five years for the first time ever

87
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:03,320
by play romantic song that I wrote for

88
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,940
her this belated Valentine's Day about

89
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,650
some of the greatest moments and

90
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,690
memories from our relationship showing

91
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,490
just how great we are together but more

92
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,710
importantly how great I am the

93
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:15,560
boyfriends another one of those videos

94
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:17,150
isn't it yep oh and I know you can't see

95
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,740
because of the sheet but there's this

96
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,630
really beautiful slideshow thing that I

97
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,250
made of the two of us since I don't like

98
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,570
to say pictures of us I kinda didn't

99
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,470
have that much to work with so I had to

100
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:35,810
do some editing

101
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:35,810
[Music]

102
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:53,340
[Music]

103
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,590
to be honest and forgive

104
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:05,630
guess 2010 because that's when ask him

105
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:08,270
out and we didn't work out there but the

106
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:12,020
five years passed and we did a collab

107
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:14,530
you were a hot song on some MTV cares

108
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:17,209
he on his side and ear for that show

109
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:19,760
went to your viewing party for your

110
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:21,890
episode because I had to let you know I

111
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,840
was into you I wanted to let you know

112
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:25,250
the truth about how I was a completely

113
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,740
in love even though it's been only a

114
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:29,330
month with you but think I did in there

115
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,300
was infatuated

116
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:35,090
the honeymoon stage only lasted a few

117
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,950
months that believe that we can a

118
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:39,320
reminisce don't remember

119
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:42,910
first aid let us remember the first kiss

120
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,680
who to say to my precious breathless :

00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,880
trip than a mr. mountain in truth in my

122
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,920
left eye now to get a nappy I was

123
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,310
needing a little bit but let me get back

124
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:53,560
to being romantic I remember taking our

125
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:56,260
first trip across the Atlantic well the

126
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,600
Pacific but that doesn't ride as well

127
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,070
and I she was a business trip so we're

128
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,410
working the whole time in the hotel but

129
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,230
the point is I remembered it and I

130
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:07,690
remember other things like our

131
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:12,150
anniversary is probably on the 26 for

132
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:15,569
23rd I was pretty close this

133
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,569
like a fan

134
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,069

139
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:47,000

00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,980
again it didn't rhyme as well so I just

143
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:59,320
had to kind of change it up a little bit

144
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:02,680
what's the reveal already oh right um

145
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:05,610

153
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,540
I'm still reviewing the fact that I'm

154
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,380
dating Arden she just couldn't be here

155
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,000
because she's filming the show in

156
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:39,600
