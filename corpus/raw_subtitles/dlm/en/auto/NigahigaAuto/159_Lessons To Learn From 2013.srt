1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,820
so I know it's not in the title and I

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,990
haven't done it in a while but this is

3
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,250
pretty much an off the pill vide for

4
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,930
those of you that are new and don't know

5
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,490
that series off the pill pretty much

6
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,050
means that I can get pregnant at any

7
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,700
time oh it means that I was diagnosed

8
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,019
with ADHD as a kid and off the pill it

9
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,340
means that I don't take my medication I

10
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,029
just turn on the camera and talk to it

11
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,230
and just let my mind flutter it's the

12
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:25,529
best word I could come up with see I

13
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:26,789
need I need my medication hey guys so

14
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:28,170
today I'm gonna be talking about some

15
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:29,609
lessons that I learned this year but

16
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,050
before I get into it first of all let me

17
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:32,430
say that I'm sorry I haven't posted a

18
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,870
video in a couple weeks the video I'm

19
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,460
currently working on is taking a lot

20
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,750
longer than I thought and it's been

21
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,550
something I really wanted to do all year

22
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,690
and just never had the time for it and I

23
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,160
still don't have the time for it that's

24
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,420
why I miss two weeks but it should be

25
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,800
done next week so I hope you guys

26
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,940
actually like it when it comes out may

27
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,680
not and I don't want to give away too

28
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,890
much but to get you guys excited here's

29
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,539
a quick preview here there's gonna be a

30
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,920
character with two eyes in it for sure

31
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,969
alright I didn't show you guys what it

32
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,949
was about because I don't want to spoil

33
00:00:53,969 --> 00:01:00,420
it and also kind of because we don't

34
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:02,129
have that much done yet you know what is

35
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,480
this look like a lizard but we just

36
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,799
finished filming so it should be done by

37
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,270
next week I'll be on the lookout for it

38
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,740
back to the top before I distract myself

39
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:14,909
again here's all the lessons I learned

40
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:16,710
in 2013 for I thanks to vine I learned

41
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,360
how every different Ray's be like in

42
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,100
every case scenario another lesson I got

43
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,049
from mine is that you can be racist as

44
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,549
long as it's funny and online why people

45
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,200
be like white people be like black

46
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,630
people be like Latin people be lying I'm

47
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,970
all like hope still not gonna download

48
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,380
it I always saw these kids doing the cup

49
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:40,280
song and I never know how to do it but

50
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:40,280
thanks to Anna Kendrick nailed it yes

51
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:44,040
twerking show me that if dance keeps

52
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,990
continuing down this row one day there's

53
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,159
still hope that I can be a dancer EDM

54
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,409
music show me that lyrics don't matter

55
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,549
anymore [ __ ] more sexual the better

56
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,720
when it comes to getting views having

57
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:53,310
your shirt off in every single picture

58
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,869
and flexing a little making it seem like

59
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,610
you're not flexing does not make you a

60
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:59,130
douche it just makes you Justin Bieber

61
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,329
whenever anyone passes away it's sad but

62
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,950
if you're a homeless guy and you pass

63
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:04,020
away from a drug overdose most people

64
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,490
are like good riddance aleb rity that

65
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,020
passes away from a drug overdose it's

66
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,940
the saddest thing ever to be people

67
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,349
sympathize for you have an excuse your

68
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,879
celebrity no matter how successful

69
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:14,109
looking or how good of a person you are

70
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,340
it doesn't matter every time you get

71
00:02:14,109 --> 00:02:16,900
into a car you're risking your life

72
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,280
especially if your speed because cars

73
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,749
treat everyone the same they don't care

74
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,999
who you are they're all about equality

75
00:02:19,749 --> 00:02:23,829
they're not racist so stop racing them

76
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:25,239
Nelson Mandela passing away is such a

77
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:26,950
big event but I think people went a

78
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:28,900
little overboard with how sad they were

79
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,639
about it I honestly think both Cory and

80
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,739
Paul's death was way more sin Elson Ben

81
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:33,879
tell ellipta he was 95 people shouldn't

82
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:36,609
be crying over him they should be

83
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:38,139
celebrating him I honestly didn't learn

84
00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:40,060
anything from this one but I couldn't

85
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:41,200
not include it granted I bought a 5

86
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,849
taught me that the only thing better

87
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,260
than killing and stealing is killing and

88
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:45,340
stealing with your friends whatever a

89
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,719
new iPhone comes out you probably

90
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,579
shouldn't get it because before you know

91
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,139
it next one's already here in Robin

92
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:51,760
Thicke song blurred lines the lyrics

93
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:52,989
what rhymes with hug me taught me that

94
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,730
if you don't have good lyrics to write

95
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:57,760
for your next line just ask what's a

96
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:00,340
good joke to end this one with seriously

97
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,540
I learned from Laura that harmonies make

98
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,540
everything sound good

99
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:08,439
Kanye West Tommy and the rest of the

100
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,359
world what it really means to be a

101
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:11,709
genius so you gotta be pretty clever and

102
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:13,689
genius to come up with such a catchy

103
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:15,250
ahead of the game name like North West

104
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:16,449
where your dog being the non genius that

105
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,099
I am I probably would have came up with

106
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:26,379
something stupid and delayed like

107
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:28,389
Southwest sorry Southwest I genuinely

108
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:29,650
love YouTube that YouTube is always

109
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:31,209
teaching me things this year I learned

110
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,979
that I should probably be into gaming

111
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:34,780
videos I also learned in your PowerPoint

112
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:36,639
up you can do whatever you want no

113
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,989
matter what anyone says or thinks for

114
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,500
example this year when they integrated

115
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:40,500
Google+

116
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:46,370
so yeah hope you guys learn something

117
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,780
anyway on a serious note there's one

118
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,069
last thing I wanted to say in this forum

119
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,719
thank you to every single person that

120
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:54,079
subscribe to this channel we recently

121
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:55,790
just passed 11 million subscribers and I

122
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:57,170
know that may not be considered a lot

123
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,730
anymore especially when you compared to

124
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,799
someone like PewDiePie who has way more

125
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:03,230
than that just know that I genuinely

126
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,849
100% appreciate each and every one of

127
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,620
you that continue to watch and support

128
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:08,120
and share my videos especially if you

129
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,620
made it this far into the video I know

130
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,790
this one's not the most interesting one

131
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,620
in the world no matter how much time

132
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,389
goes by its I'm always gonna appreciate

133
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,220
you guys and thank you guys so much and

134
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:18,410
like I always say and I know it sounds

135
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,630
super cheesy but from the bottom of my

136
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,849
heart which is also the middle of my

137
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:24,860
ribcage to the top of my thoracic cavity

138
00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:26,840
right underneath the clavicles on the

139
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,030
right side of my sternum right here in

140
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,770
this general area thank you guys so much

141
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,810
I know there's no way I can know all of

142
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,039
you and I can't physically thank every

143
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,960
single one of you but you guys have done

144
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:37,520
so much for me and I know I physically

145
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,220
can't give you guys anything so I'll

146
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,090
leave you with this one last thing one

147
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,090
last lizard neck

148
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:28,869
looks like we're evenly matched I'm not

149
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:28,869
even getting started
