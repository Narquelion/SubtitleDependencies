00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,379
like it's just you and me buddy okay so

22
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,670
maybe I can be a little lazy sometimes

23
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,229
but I don't really think that being lazy

24
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,489
is a bad thing yes maybe I didn't learn

25
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:07,229
that much in high school because I was

26
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,670
too lazy to study and I cheated to get a

27
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:10,140
good grade but I wasn't too lazy to

28
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,790
cheat right and I know most parents and

29
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,990
teachers that see this would be like if

30
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,640
you're cheating you're just cheating

31
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,229
yourself you won't learn anything being

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,640
lazy that's not true at all if you're

33
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:19,170
cheating you're learning on a problem so

34
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,580
for example the problem is that you have

35
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,560
to pass a test to get a good grade sure

36
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,939
you can spend hours and hours studying

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,920
and actually learning things you sure

38
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:27,210
you could be lazy and find a faster and

39
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,530
more efficient way to pass the problem

40
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,640
I'm not trying to encourage you to cheat

41
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,659
on the test I'm just saying that if

42
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,460
you're able to cheat and get away with

43
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,990
it and get a good grade then you kind of

44
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,369
deserve an A because you helped smarter

45
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,540
than teacher but also goes the other way

46
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:37,799
as well the teacher does can't do

47
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,880
cheating on the test you deserve an F

48
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,920
you deserve an F because you're not

49
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,030
smart enough not smart enough to cheat

50
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,799
the right way I'm just gonna go ahead

51
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,240
and say I believe that lazy people are

52
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,500
the smartest people lazy people are the

53
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,759
reason why we get to live life so much

54
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,990
more comfortably today I mean I'm sure

55
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,060

87
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,220
[Music]

88
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,780
cut from his high school basketball team

89
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,970
he locked himself in his room and cried

90
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:02,060
because he was too lazy to go back to

91
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:03,500
playing basketball his girlfriend broke

92
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,180
up with him but instead of chasing after

93
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,320
her he stayed in his dorm and created

94
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,930
something that would make her come back

95
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,970
to him he was studying to become a

96
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,959
doctor but didn't finish and yet still

97
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:15,380
became one of the most successful

98
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:17,000
doctors of all time when their movie

99
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,890
series were coming to an end instead of

100
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,600
not being lazy and starting a new series

101
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:23,709
they spit their last movie into two

102
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,970
parts and made way more money that way

103
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:27,819
they didn't know how to end their movie

104
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:30,049
so they let you do it for them you

105
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:31,609
wanted to make sure Thomas Edison was

106
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:33,140
the one who invented lightbulb and not

107
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:36,489
Benjamin Franklin because he was too

108
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,489
lazy to pay attention in history class

109
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:42,200
if you've never been lazy and done

110
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:44,890
things the easier way you're probably

111
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,890
not that smart
