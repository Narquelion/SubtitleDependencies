customers are fashionably late thanks to

15
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,010
delays hi I'm Ryan Higa and here at a

16
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,630
dry airlines we've always believed that

17
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,730
your experience flying did not just be

18
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,969
good not just great not even just an

19
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,630
all-around amazing experience so that's

20
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,550
what we do

21
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,989
our motto here at ever I airlines has

22
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,149
always been just that even though you

23
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:43,440
paid for this flight we don't work for

24
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:45,570
you we're gonna be as rude and

25
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,370
condescending as we want gonna like a DJ

26
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,960
you know push a couple buttons have a

27
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,120
couple sips before you know it we're

28
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,860
there pay me so we got this game right

29
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,809
it's kind of like the mini Olympics but

30
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,610
with bets you take a luggage but a

31
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:58,379
half's add that little red sticker on it

32
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,300
rather than placing it down nice sleep

33
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,219
we shall put it on to the plane and if

34
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,660
we hear anything broken or anything in

35
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,519
pieces and you lose

36
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,140
oh it's for fun but it also makes us be

37
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,150
careful with everyone's frag Lea stuff

38
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,340
one of my pet peeves are when people ask

39
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,950
for things but we take customer service

40
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,390
very seriously here so immediately after

41
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,090
we're finished doing what we're doing

42
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,220
like gossiping and taking a nap or

43
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,799
eating our food will not the customers

44
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,590
food the good food we go over to the

45
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,509
customer and politely say what sometimes

46
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,860
we like to do this thing up here we turn

47
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:30,750
the entertainment system all the way

48
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,640
down so when the passengers put their

49
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,049
headphones on they turn it up they can't

50
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,960
even hear anything and then out of

51
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:39,700
nowhere I pick up the PA and

52
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,200
you're the spit out oh but even with our

53
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,610
incredible staff the fry airlines

54
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,229

55
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,210
help of all of you our loyal @vy

56
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,650

57
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,060
single flight from the parents who

58
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,680
ignore their screaming kids member who

59
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,000
the angry business man shouting on his

60
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,590
cell phone for the whole plane to hear

61
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,180
for the guy who didn't learn shapes as a

62
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:57,009
kid to the armrest hugger the leg

63
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,420
spreader a guy who sits window but has

64
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:59,680
to pee every 20 minutes the overly

65
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,150
friendly guy who talks the whole flight

66
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,560
despite seeing you trying to sleep even

67
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,090
the guy who was constantly farting

68
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,590
thinking we don't know it's him and even

69
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,300

70
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:09,160
