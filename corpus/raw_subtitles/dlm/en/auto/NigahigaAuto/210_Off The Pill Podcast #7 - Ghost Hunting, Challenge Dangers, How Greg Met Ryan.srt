don't know are you yeah it was supposed

24
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,950
to be for me I just didn't get the seed

25
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,479
yeah I don't get my decisions here set

26
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,610
this whole thing up for you guys and you

27
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,159
guys ruined it all yeah well you know

28
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,560
what that is this is what you guys do

29
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,780
and when I'm not around yeah this is

30
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,820
yeah Paco pretty much just takes the

31
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,890
good job I need to add I wanted to do a

32
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,450
person to do things we could add yeah

33
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,860
that would be nice and put it next to

34
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,979
you the surprise I think we should be

35
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,149
discussing outside of the pocket people

36
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,420
are gonna be like and we need a new

37
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:03,770
table yeah in this complaining hour

38
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,770
right now we're just gonna whine about

39
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,940
all right to work in progress it is yeah

40
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:14,130
okay so Greg's never been you weren't

41
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,930
even on it when we first started I never

42
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:22,019
even watched these things yeah it's too

43
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:24,540
long anyway the reason why Greg is never

44
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:27,930
has never been on a podcast is most of

45
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,280
the time Greg is editing oh yeah pretty

46
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,890
much all the time that's the only reason

47
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,630
why and if he's on here he's not editing

48
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,880
he's not editing we're probably gonna be

49
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:39,359
an additional an additional week behind

50
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:41,010
so that's true but then but then this

51
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:44,850
week I think we're gonna make it work

52
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:48,150
yeah no mmm well will said no but he's

53
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:49,320
doing editing this one but that's always

54
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,739
a tough far with these podcasts because

55
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,970
we're not gonna miss a week so like I I

56
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,200
don't know if we should talk about the

57
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,790
video that we're about to put out cuz I

58
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,019
don't know if it's gonna be out yet just

59
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,720
like the Valentine's Day :

60
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:03,959
well it won't it won't mean it needs to

61
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,540
be out it's like the biggest most

62
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:10,109
largest amount of footage we've had yeah

63
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:14,819
on one person in a really long time yeah

64
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:17,250
it needs to be out oh you mean this last

65
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:19,530
video yeah the video coming out yeah no

66
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,840
I mean we can talk about it like tape I

67
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,150
mean we pretty much exposed the Ardon

68
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,380
thing before the video came out which

69
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,480
kind of made the video not make sense

70
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,370
but it's the worst intro ever it is

71
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,370
we're not talking about anything now on

72
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:35,480
that is complaining oh yeah where's the

73
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,480
one wearing give me some

74
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:42,120
yeah we decided to do a four-person

75
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,550
podcast today don't worry we're gonna

76
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,020
get a Dana Yin at some point we wanted

77
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,870
to keep Greg and Dana separate though

78
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,520
they're not the same person hey they're

79
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,930
not like twins we're there the same /

80
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,760
I'm just kidding we get that all that

81
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:56,280
wins that we're related you're twins you

82
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,940
see that you're related yeah actually

83
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,910
well know what I don't see that at all I

84
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:18,480
mean because of racism yeah they're both

85
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:19,680
short Dana it's pretty hairy just jump

86
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,239
into some of these stands what kind of

87
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,790
topics we guys I want to try and do

88
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,530
something different this week we didn't

89
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,419
really get to do it you said last week

90
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:29,160
yeah but we jumped in it with Ian that's

91
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:30,840
why but I want to try and do something

92
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,669
where like you know at the start of the

93
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,840
podcast just to get it rolling a little

94
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:37,320
bit better since our second half is

95
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,850
always better I wanted to try and see if

96
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,250
we could start off like with what made

97
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:42,630
you laugh the hardest most recent cuz

98
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,560
then you kind of get the giggles going

99
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,030
and then you kind of get into

100
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,010
storytelling mode and you're ready to

101
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,900
just alright you start then all right

102
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:51,570
idea definitely get alright well that's

103
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:54,570
life the funniest thing to me this week

104
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:57,030
was interacting with Ryan's dad because

105
00:04:54,570 --> 00:05:00,780
at the last video we're outside and it

106
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:03,870
was really cold for us at least and it

107
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:06,000
was outside it was in the 40s but for

108
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:09,590
Ryan's dad he's from Hawaii which is a

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,990
lot warmer so we were like he asked oh

110
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:15,360
what's the temperature and we're like oh

111
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,640
it's it's about like 40 degrees and he's

112
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,070
like what no it's not and then we pulled

113
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,590
out a phone and showed him 40 degrees

114
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:25,289
and he goes yeah but that was in your

115
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:28,470
pocket so it's probably warmer in there

116
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:30,390
and we all started dying cuz he thought

117
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:32,910
it was a thermometer and it was the

118
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:35,130
greatest it was the greatest thing well

119
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:39,960
you have to understand he has a flip

120
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:42,060
phone still doesn't know how to answer

121
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,099
calls he knows how to send calls which

122
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,560
is a huge upgrade over the past couple

123
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:47,910
years he doesn't he doesn't answer any

124
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,420
of my calls or

125
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:53,040
my mom's and he yeah I mean that he only

126
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,510
can make calls I don't know why he

127
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,570
doesn't answer it yeah

128
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:59,520
just outside you saw me uh what the SD

129
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:01,950
cards for the cameras and he was like

130
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,630
what is that and I was like oh this is

131
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:06,480
like this before the cameras this is

132
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:12,120
what we film on this is a film he said

133
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:15,510
no I didn't hear this story yeah I'm

134
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,580
pretty sure he is did not understand

135
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:20,070
technology at all like he probably

136
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:24,380
couldn't turn on a computer I can't

137
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:24,380
actually probably I would like to see it

138
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:28,560
well it's he's a rare breed that of

139
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,600
people who don't understand technology

140
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,830
that's whatever how about you guys what

141
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:36,390
is something that made you laugh really

142
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:39,390
hard recently no honestly depressing

143
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:42,030
week for me nobody laughs here yeah I

144
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:45,330
mean I wish you would have told us your

145
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:48,210
asses like you were really prepared or

146
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:49,470
we aren't yeah you think I want to try

147
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:52,950
something new that I thought I've been

148
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:55,080
prepared yeah but uh yeah you guys feel

149
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:57,540
good on the spot no I have nothing that

150
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:01,110
I can think of right now that is the

151
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:02,730
thing that I like that is yeah but then

152
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,230
that again that leads us right back to

153
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:06,240
what we are not sure we're gonna talk

154
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,500
about which I think we can let's just

155
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,130
say it go for it yes

156
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:14,190
it probably will be out right we'll know

157
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:18,030
it'll be out so we did a ryan tries

158
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:19,830
ghost hunting video and it's kind of

159
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,330
based off of and inspired by Ghost

160
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,070
Adventures

161
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:25,080
I just always wanted to do that I don't

162
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:29,780
know if you guys actually I didn't ask

163
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:31,740
you guys what you guys believe in ghosts

164
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:34,650
we talked about are we talking about

165
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,780
before or after our experience no I mean

166
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,940
okay before and after has it changed you

167
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,680
do you believe in ghosts it's changed a

168
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,300
little bit for me I would say how so

169
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,800
from the video from this last video from

170
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,750
the last video yeah because you know

171
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,130
like for Mia I don't have any hard

172
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,560
evidence that they did exist I don't

173
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:53,310
have any hard evidence that they didn't

174
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,510
exist I don't know what yeah and so I

175
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,340
just like I was just going into it with

176
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:58,140
an open mind like we'll see what happens

177
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,120
you know so you didn't really I know you

178
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,800
don't have evidence buyer did you

179
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,740
believe

180
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:08,130
I was more inclined to be open to the

181
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:10,770
idea of ghosts after that oh yeah

182
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:12,900
what Oh was it just like the whole

183
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:14,100
experience yeah kind of like certain

184
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,170
things that just couldn't be explained

185
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,480
like what that Wow how does that happen

186
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:21,060
yeah yeah okay I was like I don't know

187
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,100
why I thought you were very like Ghostly

188
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:26,010
yeah like super believer even before

189
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:29,450
that yeah yeah I just get scared very

190
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:33,540
easily but that's me Greg does too I'm a

191
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:35,610
scaredy cat for sure and that experience

192
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:38,700
just kind of solidified it for me yeah

193
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:42,090
that whole thing was just it was I felt

194
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,380
like going into it it was kind of like a

195
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,270
gimmick thing like I thought it was

196
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,460
gonna be just like this cheesy tour that

197
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:51,450
we take and people were gonna be kind of

198
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:54,210
like you know overhyping it but man I'm

199
00:08:51,450 --> 00:09:00,990
a firm believer now I'm relieved before

200
00:08:54,210 --> 00:09:05,160
though no extra firm yeah I mean I

201
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:08,340
always just had it I mean I believe in a

202
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,050
lot of things it's a ghost is you smile

203
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,690
those things that are one of the things

204
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:14,550
I believe I believe in in and zombies

205
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:18,270
I've been preparing for zombies for a

206
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:19,820
while so like seriously I mean you

207
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:23,040
believe that there's it's a possibility

208
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,690
sure or that they already exist no not

209
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,300
it could already exist but I mean it's a

210
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:32,520
possibility that they could happen I

211
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:34,380
guess it's just fun to kind of keep that

212
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,020
in the back of my mind and prepare for

213
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:40,260
it yeah I guess so

214
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:42,330
me yeah go ahead I feel like I'm pretty

215
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,860
neutral on it still I feel like last

216
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,000
time we talked about it I feel very much

217
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,220
the same way like I'm not gonna

218
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,840
discredit people from having their own

219
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,790
experiences so that's why I can't really

220
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,830
say like oh they don't exist like I'm

221
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,480
not gonna be like you know Paco had this

222
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:56,250
experience and say that wasn't real

223
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,570
because obviously it was real to him I

224
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,510
just haven't had like a personal

225
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:04,700
experience right and and going there at

226
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:07,380
that tour it was really it was fun like

227
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,900
it was a really awesome experience to

228
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,730
like play with the tools and like get to

229
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,670
all the tools that you see on like those

230
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:16,010
ghosts exactly

231
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:18,290
yeah was it called a dick that's go spa

232
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,940
talk ball yeah that was crazy box yeah

233
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,660
all those things it was just like it's

234
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,910
very interesting

235
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:24,320
yeah they had like five devices that

236
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:27,050
each one did something different yeah

237
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,990
and it's cool to see what each one did

238
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:33,170
yeah yeah so I don't know I'm still

239
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:34,970
maybe I'm like a little bit in leaning a

240
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:36,260
little bit more towards believing after

241
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,970
that experience because everything adds

242
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,550
up to what you know your all your

243
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:43,360
experiences let's you know create your

244
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:46,280
whatever you believe in but for me I

245
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,590
don't know that you never so that you

246
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:51,110
never had any personal experiences

247
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:53,360
that's why you're I mean that's cool

248
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,970
yeah yeah I mean I was I wouldn't say

249
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,800
that I was a super skeptic I mean I told

250
00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:00,290
the story already on the other podcast

251
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,790
yeah about my experience so I'm not

252
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:04,040
gonna go through that again but like I

253
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:05,660
was you know growing up in Hawaii Sean

254
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,580
and I used to go Sun all the time and we

255
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,290
used to go like all the most haunted

256
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,360
spots everywhere all the legends never

257
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:13,070
saw anything so I never believed and

258
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,050
then just randomly that one night

259
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:17,210
happened and I kind of leaned the other

260
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,860
way but I'm even then even before we did

261
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:21,470
the tour I was still kind of uh

262
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:23,270
I don't know kind of skeptic right even

263
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,800
when she brought that the other devices

264
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:26,390
I was like man they could have easily

265
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,700
tampered with this stuff to make it

266
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:30,020
maybe somebody's like controlling it but

267
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,120
then there was some just some things

268
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:34,480
like Paco said I I couldn't really

269
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,800
explain this doesn't make sense right so

270
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,560
that was a little freaky I think there's

271
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,180
one experience that we'll had that you

272
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,270
didn't really share with people with the

273
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:46,160
the box that when it kind of like

274
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:50,000
glitched out and the battery died yeah

275
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,530
well I mean it's it was one that well I

276
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,940
mean we'll try to put in the video but

277
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:54,860
it was we never really had like an

278
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,360
ending to that segment really yeah

279
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,190
that's like the scary part because it

280
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,320
just kind of ended and we're all like

281
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:03,890
wait what just happened yeah like

282
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:06,170
basically there was like a tool that it

283
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:08,600
was like a dictionary of words and

284
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:10,790
somehow like through energy or whatever

285
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,460
the its they think that the ghost can

286
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:15,620
you know essentially manipulate the

287
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:18,080
device to pick a certain word it's kind

288
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:20,000
of a modern-day Ouija board yeah exactly

289
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,770
exactly without you having to spell it

290
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,920
out like they just like text it to you

291
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:27,470
yeah and so when we were like it just we

292
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,300
were really like into finding this

293
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,340
Ryan was getting like a big meter and

294
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,720
like the device was going off and then

295
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,760
all of a sudden like we hadn't really

296
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,400
had too much activity on this thing this

297
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,980
thing like goes crazy and it put out

298
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,380
like six or seven words and I can only

299
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:45,680
pick out like two or three but two of

300
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:47,390
them were Japanese and present and I

301
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,430
immediately thought like okay of course

302
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:51,230
they're like they're understanding that

303
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:54,350
we have a lot of Japanese people here

304
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:56,990
and they're saying that you're Japanese

305
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:58,510
well to me I instantly thought like made

306
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:00,530
me think I talk very well this was like

307
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:02,270
would they be okay with that because

308
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:04,010
like really it's like a they're from a

309
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,600
completely yeah time no no that's what I

310
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:07,640
was saying I was like because there was

311
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,090
also before that it was like believe or

312
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:12,530
like go or not what was it was like it

313
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,580
you're like not in the way there was

314
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:17,450
something there's other words I really

315
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:19,490
believe yeah so and then I was thinking

316
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:22,910
like okay this is okay this place was

317
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:25,310
built or around in 1913 and you know

318
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:26,690
that's like around the time when that's

319
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:28,970
not around the time but let's say these

320
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:30,680
people you know we're 20 years old or 30

321
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:34,700
years old and this it's around what

322
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:38,780
world World War two yeah right well is

323
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:40,550
that 1949 which is very poor not it was

324
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:43,040
around then those people could have been

325
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:45,050
around then and that's when you know the

326
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,550
Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor I mean it

327
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:49,100
could be some animosity I don't know

328
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:55,040
yeah I was probably the most Japanese

329
00:13:49,100 --> 00:14:00,040
people in that here's the real question

330
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:03,800
soundbite you ready can ghosts be racist

331
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:06,920
shoot I mean for their time make sense

332
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:09,770
cuz yeah they didn't have PC culture

333
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:12,320
back then yeah well I mean they probably

334
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:13,790
had their version of it yes probably

335
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,620
super inappropriate but that's exactly

336
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:18,170
what I thought like immediately as I saw

337
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,210
I saw it no way hmm

338
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:22,370
like I really thought about that like if

339
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,630
you know different time yeah there's a

340
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,130
completely different time like would

341
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:27,500
that affect them how they want in

342
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:29,360
interact with you know people know it's

343
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:32,810
kind of crazy it is crazy

344
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:36,500
so alright well if you guys were ghosts

345
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:38,780
and you you could select what time era

346
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,259
that you could haunt and where what

347
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,929
would it be

348
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:43,889
select look correct question I'm Errol

349
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:47,069
you type that out

350
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:48,389
no I'm just talking about goes will be

351
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:52,019
you know so we're trying to keep this

352
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:54,179
podcast under 60 minutes um yeah I would

353
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:57,410
probably hunt right now hunt you guys

354
00:14:54,179 --> 00:15:00,539
we're asking that question would you

355
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:02,879
just start just keep unplugging each

356
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:04,889
other's mics I don't know we always have

357
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,539
issues when we start podcasts from

358
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:08,039
whatever reason there might be a ghost

359
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:10,139
thing one of the Shaun's ghosts like

360
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:11,879
he's not dead but he just has a ghost or

361
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:13,199

something about Sean being dead I like

366
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:28,139
what nobody hears anyway that actually

367
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:30,329
could lead to her another topic we want

368
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:32,910
to bring up is very dark man this is

369
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:34,859
started off pretty dark how do you how

373
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:43,410
the name of my brothers cat by the way

374
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:47,509
yeah when I was in videos normal so we

375
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:47,509
put up the cap of Momo in the podcast

376
00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:54,569
okay right now it's scary uh anyway um

377
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:56,009
the first I mean I saw it on my Facebook

378
00:15:54,569 --> 00:15:56,699
Timeline and it's one of the I don't get

379
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:58,709
scared easily

380
00:15:56,699 --> 00:16:00,629
yeah but I just was scrolling I was just

381
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:02,339
like what like I thought was one my

382
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:04,289
friends like they edited their photos or

383
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:06,209
whatever apparently was this was a

384
00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:08,910
sculpture or something like that art

385
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:09,600
piece of some sort yeah Japanese art

386
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:12,899
piece

387
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,369
yeah but it was very I actually felt

388
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:15,569
weird by it

389
00:16:14,369 --> 00:16:18,299
like I was like I don't want to see this

390
00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:21,119
you don't get scared easily yep but um

391
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:23,449
it's good art it was a hoax right it was

392
00:16:21,119 --> 00:16:27,449
like reported supposedly supposedly

393
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:30,869
people believed that it would get

394
00:16:27,449 --> 00:16:33,029
younger kids or audiences to do

395
00:16:30,869 --> 00:16:35,939
dangerous challenges that could lead to

396
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:38,039
death such as like turning the gas stove

397
00:16:35,939 --> 00:16:40,319
on and then just letting get was Ruffolo

398
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,549
it was reported on that someone in

399
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:44,459
sacramento raised some lady in

400
00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:51,689
sacramento had a daughter who said that

401
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:54,120
a Gregan one 6a anyway they she had a

402
00:16:51,689 --> 00:16:56,430
daughter supposedly

403
00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:00,360
that turned on the gas stove because a

404
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:01,410
YouTube video of Momo told her to do

405
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,700
that personally is like a moment

406
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:04,590
challenge or something like that I don't

407
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,760
know but it was it was debunked that

408
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:11,400
that person was making that up

409
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:15,090
Wow that's crazy it's actually a

410
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,980
challenge huh challenge yeah people were

411
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:18,660
saying that oh this is such a basically

412
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:21,060
people were it I feel like it was like

413
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,740
that lady was just like or I don't know

414
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,270
who it was who started it was just like

415
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,190
hey I want like some kind of attention

416
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:27,570
like I can't believe like somebody you

417
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,800
know what people like to post I can't

418
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:30,180
believe this is what's wrong with the

419
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,160
world or whatever like those kind of

420
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,930
polls I don't know I I'm Trent a lot of

421
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,980
older people these girls like they'd

422
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:37,020
like to be outraged

423
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,060
yeah I'll read yeah or something but

424
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:41,220
that's like that's I mean I when I saw

425
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:43,860
those like dan that's crazy but like she

426
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,180
does like that could actually happen now

427
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,040
that could start because somebody

428
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:50,460
created that that whole you know I mean

429
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:53,610
yeah it's so there's no reported

430
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:55,860
incidences of like actual things that

431
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,940
happen right not yet not not according

432
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,510
to the Articles that I read or anything

433
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,790
like that

434
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:03,000
yeah not that I know of that is scary I

435
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:06,090
think it just it's really a shame too

436
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,130
because it kind of sheds like negative

437
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:10,470
light a little bit on YouTube in a sense

438
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:12,540
to people who don't really maybe maybe

439
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:14,310
someone will never know about this being

440
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,140
a hoax you know like from older

441
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:17,670
generation wherever and now they have

442
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:21,540
you know it's kind of giving them

443
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:22,860
another reason to not I mean that's kind

444
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,750
of what I think when I hear it is like

445
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:27,030
meant that it I'm glad it's a hoax of

446
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,380
course but it's like it's kind of kind

447
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:30,930
of unfortunate you know it's kind of

448
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:33,570
like I don't know do you guys remember

449
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:36,180
any like hoaxes or stuff when you were a

450
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,590
kid cuz I don't even know if there were

451
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:40,080
hoaxes or not but I remember as a kid my

452
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:43,230
mom would constantly get these emails

453
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:46,920
that would alert her like kids in like

454
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:49,080
Western us have been getting getting

455
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:51,120
dealt drugs that are passed off as pop

456
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,250
rocks and then when you eat them like it

457
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,690
can be so strong that children die and

458
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,910
so she would be like you can't eat pop

459
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,990
rocks anymore I never heard of that yeah

460
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:00,300
so that's why I don't know if those are

461
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,530
ever real or if those are hoaxes seems

462
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,950
like the same kind of thing though yeah

463
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:07,660

was probably like uh like The Grudge

496
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:45,370

501
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,670
of the reasons why I was like kind of

00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,140
impressed that you came I mean like I

503
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:09,940

willing to film this ghost-hunting

505
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,990
episode because I know yeah more than

506
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,970
anyone in the group greg is probably the

507
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,710
most afraid of those babies Dana maybe

508
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:19,779
Dana no I

509
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:22,570
cuz Dena came with us to watch the

510
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:24,070
conjuring - Greg what Greg I mean he

511
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:26,230
wasn't there but I'm sure he would not

512
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:28,299
have wanted to go watch that Tina did I

513
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:30,700
don't even like watching the movies you

514
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:31,960
guys watch like conjuring all that I

515
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:35,230
said you don't come with us

516
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:38,950
I hate those movies they're scary

517
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:41,080
yeah do you think what um I guess it's

518
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:44,020
because you're a believer I think it's

519
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:46,149
just like all right so I'm not scared of

520
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:48,220
like just aam be sand werewolves and

521
00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:50,350
vampires cuz like you can you can fight

522
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,179
those things right but like ghosts and

523
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:55,960
stuff like they're demons

524
00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:57,309
yeah I'm defenseless eminence I can't do

525
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,350
anything towards them that's why I

526
00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:00,669
thought about like Chucky's like I mean

527
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:04,659
it was a scary movie it as a kid but

528
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:08,289
when I got yeah a little toy like if it

529
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:09,640
kills me I deserve to die but same wait

530
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:11,440
like the grudge girl I was like dude

531
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,000
this little tour the ring girl I was

532
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,529
like if she crawls it on my TV I was

533
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,929
like thinking like you know like in a

534
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:19,299
scary movie 3 where she crawled through

535
00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:21,490
the TV and then what's that lady the

536
00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:23,440
black girl on that she starts beating

537
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,779
her ass and I was just like that's

538
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,730
exactly how I think it would go you know

539
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:30,520
if you died to this little girl

540
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:32,380
it was decomposed I mean like she's like

541
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,640
she should be able to break you know I

542
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,500
mean like your skin's breaking your

543
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:43,539
bones probably rotting she probably

544
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:45,970
smells like that Zimbabwe weird we don't

545
00:22:43,539 --> 00:22:47,980
know things you're also probably doing

546
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:50,529
judo when you watch out huh you were

547
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:53,110
probably mean I mean I definitely was

548
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:54,549
but yeah I was like I see how she would

549
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:56,409
come at me and I'm already playing home

550
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:58,360
I'm gonna take her down get behind her

551
00:22:56,409 --> 00:23:00,850
I'd snap her neck Chris is there such

552
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:03,159
thing as a dude judo chop there's no

553
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:04,539
such thing as a judo chop actually you

554
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:08,529
know what if someone's grabbing your

555
00:23:04,539 --> 00:23:09,640
lapel yeah you could chop your hand down

556
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:11,350
but it's not a real thing that's not

557
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,230
what he says judo chop there's no judo

558
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:14,649
kick either come on Austin Powers come

559
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:17,830
on

560
00:23:14,649 --> 00:23:20,529
they done did life is a lie yeah but

561
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:22,510
anyway I just thought it was um I was

562
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:24,730
kind of shocked so even at some points

563
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:26,740
because Greg will go off and get

564
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:29,230
equipment and you know do things on his

565
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,940
own without anybody else around the

566
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:33,070
other night when we were filming I was

567
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,109
that you were like just going off on

568
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:37,570
your own I turned on like when I get

569
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:40,509
into film mode yeah I just don't even

570
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:42,759
think anymore just like autopilot yeah I

571
00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:46,029
was just filming so the crazy thing was

572
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:49,179
when I was filming later on down to

573
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:51,009
during the day like we just kept having

574
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:52,690
camera equipment failure like our

575
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:54,429
batteries kept dying and stuff like that

576
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:56,080
and that was the stuff that was creeping

577
00:23:54,429 --> 00:23:58,210
me out of broken me out of my you know

578
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,009
my yeah yeah that's like wait all these

579
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:02,200
stuff is charged and I just keeps dying

580
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:03,820
yeah and that never happened yeah it

581
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,379
never happens and he said it might

582
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,849
because it's supposedly like the ghosts

583
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:08,979
are pulling energy from you know

584
00:24:06,849 --> 00:24:11,139
electronics or whatever and Paco's phone

585
00:24:08,979 --> 00:24:13,149
went off randomly even though he had

586
00:24:11,139 --> 00:24:14,559
full service and even then I was still

587
00:24:13,149 --> 00:24:16,509
skeptical I was like okay what if they

588
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,909
have a device that's making our like a

589
00:24:16,509 --> 00:24:20,049
DJ exactly yeah but then my phone was

590
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:22,389
fine the whole time everybody else it

591
00:24:20,049 --> 00:24:23,859
was just like random you know moments

592
00:24:22,389 --> 00:24:25,389
that we didn't even get to get on camera

593
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:28,090
a lot of times cuz it was just like

594
00:24:25,389 --> 00:24:29,409
we're setting up yeah it was old I was

595
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:31,139
getting I was getting scared that we

596
00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:33,190
weren't gonna be able get to shot

597
00:24:31,139 --> 00:24:35,499
honestly because I was like I have two

598
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:37,809
batteries they died instantly

599
00:24:35,499 --> 00:24:39,970
and I have to use this specific infrared

600
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:41,979
camera to get these shots and it was

601
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:44,499
like kind of that was making me scared

602
00:24:41,979 --> 00:24:48,340
like yeah I want to get this shot so I

603
00:24:44,499 --> 00:24:53,320
can't so I don't know I feel like you

604
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:57,009
could fight a ghost Oh sage but when you

605
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:59,289
cross when you think about it like when

606
00:24:57,009 --> 00:25:01,210
there is a ghost most times they're just

607
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:02,889
scaring you like it you don't hear about

608
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:04,629
a ghost like killing anyone that's true

609
00:25:02,889 --> 00:25:05,859
yeah maybe like if it's a demon and you

610
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:07,989
got possessed but how often do you hear

611
00:25:05,859 --> 00:25:10,479
about that in your life yeah or same

612
00:25:07,989 --> 00:25:12,789
with most times it's somebody you know

613
00:25:10,479 --> 00:25:14,259
just scaring getting scared because they

614
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:16,359
saw something but they'd never like oh

615
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:17,889
it grabs my hair it's like well okay

616
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:19,629
that's not even assault

617
00:25:17,889 --> 00:25:22,269
yeah actually I don't know that's

618
00:25:19,629 --> 00:25:25,119
probably a song if someone like touched

619
00:25:22,269 --> 00:25:26,409
your hair like well I mean I don't want

620
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:28,330
to get too much into the video because

621
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:31,869
we're just giving away the whole thing

622
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:33,970
yeah just in case but how about this

623
00:25:31,869 --> 00:25:37,690
then instead of talking about this video

624
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:40,149
let's talk about the is synergy between

625
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:42,909
both Greg and Ryan so a lot of people

626
00:25:40,149 --> 00:25:44,230
losses the process yeah yeah and how how

627
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:48,179
well you guys work together

628
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:51,370
um so like with a lot of the videos most

629
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:53,440
Ryan will write the full scrip have like

630
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:56,620
some wild ideas cuz like he said another

631
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,270
podcast he likes to push his ideas and

632
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:00,100
see like oh is this possible make I want

633
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:02,260
to try something new every time and

634
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:05,320
he'll come up to Greg and Greg is

635
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:08,169
someone who never says no he just I was

636
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:10,980
like yeah okay we can do that yeah so

637
00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:14,200
speaking on that even just recently I

638
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:16,419
made over he was fixing another edit and

639
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:19,510
I just text him randomly I had this idea

640
00:26:16,419 --> 00:26:20,950
and basically I was just like hey do you

641
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:23,860
think it's possible to do this

642
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:25,059
and before you mean I had a chance to

643
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,860
answer I was like wait I have to

644
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:28,299
rephrase that because Greg is always

645
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:31,330
gonna say it's possible cuz you'll find

646
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:33,400
a way but it's a matter of like okay is

647
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:36,370
this gonna be worth us putting the time

648
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:38,650
into and yeah because Greg always

649
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:40,360
figures out how to do anything it might

650
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:42,940
take two months yeah but you'll figure

651
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,140
it out just like we I mean like I mean

652
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:46,840
we let's talk about it like cuz there's

653
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:48,340
some videos like I wasn't too worried

654
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,870
about the fortnight one I mean obviously

655
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,610
there's a lot of effects in that and

656
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:54,130
stuff like that but I ask you is that

657
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:56,799
how possible is this to build a entire

658
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:57,340
fort you know do we have to build it in

659
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,290
real life

660
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:02,200
frança is it easier to make an effect

661
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:05,010
for it yeah um and you says possible so

662
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:09,070
I'm like okay but it's a matter of like

663
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:13,870
how possible and in a realistic time

664
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:16,510
right right usually it's I I look at the

665
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:21,040
thing on paper or your text message or

666
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:23,559
whatever and on paper looks it looks way

667
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:26,950
more doable then you know

668
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:29,080
in actuality so yeah III I often times

669
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:31,660
jump the gun and I usually just say yes

670
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,890
just kind of like you know it's just so

671
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:35,410
I can start thinking about it because

672
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:37,000
once I know something we're actually

673
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:38,740
gonna do something that's when like my

674
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,070
brain kind of starts putting the pieces

675
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:44,679
together and doing all the logistics but

676
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:46,870
sometimes it is impossible

677
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:50,140
yeah but we're too far into it right

678
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:51,760
it's like we can't turn back now well so

679
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:54,220
likely a good example is you know on the

680
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:57,040
exposed video yeah the music video we

681
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:58,119
did we're I was just pitching ideas with

682
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:02,079
with you and I was like

683
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:03,369
this is so much post work like I didn't

684
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:05,139
I didn't have an idea for that bridge

685
00:28:03,369 --> 00:28:07,779
part I know what I wanted to see I want

686
00:28:05,139 --> 00:28:10,689
to see all these little screens right as

687
00:28:07,779 --> 00:28:12,369
we're spinning around which we did but I

688
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:14,439
didn't know how it was and then your

689
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:17,679
idea you're like oh and what if all

690
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:22,749
those screens ends up being you I was

691
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:25,659
like yeah yeah that's awesome and

692
00:28:22,749 --> 00:28:26,319
because you said it I was like okay then

693
00:28:25,659 --> 00:28:28,629
it's doable

694
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:31,509
yeah but I mean and you did you did it

695
00:28:28,629 --> 00:28:33,839
yeah I mean most of times the effects

696
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:36,399
and stuff that we do I mean it's there

697
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:37,659
me see all over Hollywood all the time

698
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,579
like anything is possible nowadays

699
00:28:37,659 --> 00:28:41,709
especially with today's technology what

700
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:43,059
they have a lot of time and yes that's

701
00:28:41,709 --> 00:28:44,709
what yeah that's what kind of holds us

702
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:49,329
back it's just you know like technology

703
00:28:44,709 --> 00:28:53,139
manpower and just time overall and but

704
00:28:49,329 --> 00:28:54,939
like the ideas that's kind of like where

705
00:28:53,139 --> 00:28:57,939
I guess me and Ryan kind of shine

706
00:28:54,939 --> 00:29:00,339
because he'll write something and I will

707
00:28:57,939 --> 00:29:04,359
kind of see it a completely different

708
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:08,349
way and we don't really combine our

709
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:10,419
ideas until like midway when we're kind

710
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:11,169
of we both got an idea of where we're

711
00:29:10,419 --> 00:29:13,209
heads are at

712
00:29:11,169 --> 00:29:14,889
so sometimes it's like two completely

713
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:16,689
different videos or two completely

714
00:29:14,889 --> 00:29:18,279
different ideas coming together mm-hmm

715
00:29:16,689 --> 00:29:20,079
and sometimes it works sometimes it

716
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:23,589
sometimes it's you know sometimes it's

717
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:25,689
like mid like filming yeah like oh this

718
00:29:23,589 --> 00:29:29,349
is not what I was exactly but for

719
00:29:25,689 --> 00:29:31,389
whatever we it ends up most times we try

720
00:29:29,349 --> 00:29:33,339
to at least make it work yeah even if

721
00:29:31,389 --> 00:29:35,289
that means getting rid of something yeah

722
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:37,539
but I mean that's that's usually the

723
00:29:35,289 --> 00:29:40,149
process for that for the most part yeah

724
00:29:37,539 --> 00:29:42,219
sometimes Ryan like fully leaves some

725
00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:43,989
sections blank you know like whenever we

726
00:29:42,219 --> 00:29:46,779
do like a connection type video like a

727
00:29:43,989 --> 00:29:49,479
like a Miley Cyrus well you call that

728
00:29:46,779 --> 00:29:51,249
video like conspiracy conspiracy theory

729
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:53,619
I guess yeah when Ryan goes into his

730
00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:55,329
Ryan math stuff where he's just

731
00:29:53,619 --> 00:29:57,759
connecting the dots and he doesn't

732
00:29:55,329 --> 00:29:59,199
really know how to visually yeah so he

733
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:01,629
just leaves it blank and then you know

734
00:29:59,199 --> 00:30:05,409
it's up to us to kind of connect

735
00:30:01,629 --> 00:30:08,559
together yeah like like if there's no

736
00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:09,969
specific direction on those then what a

737
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,710
lot of times what Greg's good at is

738
00:30:09,969 --> 00:30:14,110
figure like visually

739
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:15,580
I think you see everything visually yeah

740
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:17,740
that's where I see things more like

741
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,270
almost like a math equation right right

742
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,500
and that's why it helps because it's

743
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:23,140
like we're working two different parts

744
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:26,890
of our brains if that makes sense it's

745
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:29,740
like well we're packin de but yeah

746
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:32,200
that's uh that's kind of like what yeah

747
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:35,680
mostly the processes like I will say the

748
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:38,320
very first kind of experience that kind

749
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:40,180
of relates to this like your question is

750
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:43,570
like when we first started working with

751
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:45,520
Ryan were in Los Angeles and it was me

752
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:48,310
and Greg and like I was gonna be

753
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,960
starting to do BTS and Greg was just

754
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:55,960
starting to do effects on first channel

755
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:57,940
and it was the I one you were there for

756
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:01,660
that yeah you were there for dear Ryan

757
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:03,520
can you open your eyes no my first video

758
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:05,710
I do know we did your first one I think

759
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,450
I think with movies and minutes Avengers

760
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:09,640
that's the first one I like that's the

761
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:11,650
one who came out to Vegas yeah but that

762
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:14,530
one was I feel like New York I literally

763
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:16,600
opened him oh you were like holy cow

764
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:18,760
like I've always had these ideas and I

765
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:21,820
want to do but you couldn't do them on

766
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:25,870
your own so when you had literally like

767
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:29,290
the capability to now do these like

768
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:32,080
graphic or CGI kind of bigger ideas

769
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:34,480
they're kind of more I don't know you

770
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,220
just can't edit them like cutting scenes

771
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,450
it's like you obviously had to spend

772
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,160
time if you're not familiar with it

773
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:45,430
someone where it's dear Ryan can you

774
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:47,620
open your eyes and he goes is really

775
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:51,160
really big and Greg like made these 3d

776
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:53,470
is too big it destroys the room and the

777
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:58,540
building and then for whatever reason it

778
00:31:53,470 --> 00:32:00,160
starts teasing Dietrich's you know but

779
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:02,230
the thing is that's I didn't even think

780
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:04,120
like even if I could see it in my head

781
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:05,710
I've never done anything like that was

782
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:07,870
like how the hell cuz I was on like

783
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:09,400
iMovie I think exactly there's no way

784
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:11,710
unless you feel like green screen which

785
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:14,500
I kind experimented with did not know

786
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:16,690
what I was doing but uh I didn't know

787
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:19,530
that was possible and I just open the

788
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:21,940
door for so much work exactly

789
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:22,840
so much more time spiraled out of

790
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,550
control

791
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,400
yep and then we went downhill from there

792
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:29,720
just

793
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:31,309
just stress the stress it's like alright

794
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,690
well that I mean that seems like an

795
00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:35,510
interesting you guys started talking

796
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:38,240
about your origin story almost yeah

797
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:39,800
but before we go into our origin story I

798
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,290
think it's about time we hit that

799
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,210
halfway mark we are we're there already

800
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:46,220
yes we are yeah we were talking about

801
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:48,650
goals for a while huh she should break

802
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:52,150
she should break do you guys have to she

803
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:54,950
she not she could she she again again I

804
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:59,510
agree the quids you guys she she a

805
00:32:54,950 --> 00:33:02,600
balloon ooh try it out and doodle good

806
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:03,080
all right she should do the break just

807
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:15,170
she should

808
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:17,929
all right break change it up a little

809
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:20,540
bit you know what else is something that

810
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:24,110
we've changed up what I feel like we've

811
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:27,470
gone to big league like we mean I'm

812
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:29,270
about to explain whoa why are you so mad

813
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:32,240
because you cut me off like always

814
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:33,980
what does that mean though but uh I

815
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,080
think we got two big lis cuz once we got

816
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:38,900
one sponsor

817
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:42,470
we've never begged for another that is

818
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:44,300
true yeah I remember you guys did this

819
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:49,760
one podcast where like you guys were

820
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:50,780
trying to get Shauna a piping job that's

821
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,090
no we're trying to get him a

822
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,960
volunteering job and I think he actually

823
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:56,030
got a job

824
00:33:53,960 --> 00:34:01,429
oh really yeah for real I just talked to

825
00:33:56,030 --> 00:34:03,020
him well I don't I I don't know if I

826
00:34:01,429 --> 00:34:04,850
should say I don't it's not my place but

827
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:09,320
and I don't know for sure but I'm pretty

828
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:10,850
I'm pretty sure he may or may not have

829
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:13,340
gotten a job I'm not saying because of

830
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:14,899
the podcast by the way it's I he was

831
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:16,580
looking to get a fallen he was trying to

832
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:18,470
just volunteer yeah cuz they weren't

833
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:21,050
letting him volunteer which I thought

834
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:23,330
was weird but it makes sense no but yeah

835
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:25,879
he's uh I think he may or may not have

836
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:31,730
gotten a job well maybe Congrats Sean

837
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:35,090
maybe Congrats John so kind of like man

838
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:37,580
we're back and we're back yeah they said

839
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:38,909
that nobody sees that part yeah what

840
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,710
were you talking about

841
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:41,639
we'll watch you beg for a sponsor real

842
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,720
quick and then we could jump in here

843
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:45,089
orange this is the part where we're

844
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:48,990
supposed to be like hey and thank you so

845
00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:51,359
much to something we're sponsoring this

846
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:54,030
shishi break yeah I think that turns

847
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:56,940
away sponsors to be that we call it a

848
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:59,430
shisha break hell I don't even know what

849
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:01,109
it is okay let's keep it that way then

850
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,579
yeah we explained it though before yeah

851
00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:05,220
but they don't watch the befores they

852
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:14,460
just look at the views oh good yeah yeah

853
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:16,160
those went down let's talk about yeah we

854
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:18,990
I guess we could bring up origin story

855
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:23,549
again the one thing that I read the most

856
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:25,349
was how did you guys meet and it kind of

857
00:35:23,549 --> 00:35:28,079
includes all three of you yeah it

858
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:30,450
includes more than me a lot it's like a

859
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,730
lot of people so this is the real story

860
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:35,970
because we made the animated thing that

861
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:37,920
was I mean it was it was in the right

862
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:39,599
order kind of it was kind of the story

863
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,910
but I was like a joke but I'm not a

864
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,039
stripper so many people have asked and

865
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:46,529
be like you were a stripper and you took

866
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:47,910
that seriously no but the people took it

867
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:49,380
serious that's why I was I think they

868
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:51,660
did I think the joke no they actually

869
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,670
asked they think you they really think

870
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:55,770
they thought you were super but I'm like

871
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:57,690
look at my body do I look like I have

872
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:59,400
the value for that yeah you're very

873
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:01,799
muscular probably pay a couple bucks

874
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,809

875
00:36:01,799 --> 00:36:05,760

right now

942
00:38:54,110 --> 00:39:00,380

943
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:02,140
all looked up to when we saw dancing in

944
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:04,850

we saw him I was like kind of

948
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:15,080
intimidated by him and now I hate him I

949
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:20,270
could already see Derek in China

950
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:22,310

951
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:24,890

though he was I'm he was super dope he

953
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:29,240
was a traveling like dancer and they

954
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:31,940
would go to other countries and they

955
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:33,770
would win yeah and like we like we would

956
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:36,200
have never been able to do that kind of

957
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:39,320
stuff cuz we weren't the best dancers

958
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:41,630
but we could make good shows yeah we was

959
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:43,940
our Forte performers you guys are known

960
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:45,710
as the funny guys we really clowns yeah

961
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:47,870
like literally circus clowns you made

962
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:49,640
other dance crews laugh yeah pretty much

963
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:51,200
it's all about entertainment that's what

964
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,940
you guys were known for then when you

965
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,340

966
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:57,530

970
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:03,380
stunts there's a little bit of

971
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:05,660
everything but the things you guys have

972
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:09,710
was comedy mm-hmm yeah the producers

973
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:12,230
actually hated us what yeah you did Dom

974
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:15,440
Dom was he was the judge at the gym on

975
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:17,000
the show I'm like the waitress he would

976
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,920
kind of tell us like you know behind the

977
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,540
scenes stuff and he was like yeah you

978
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:22,820
guys might need to step up your game

979
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:30,200
because the producers they're like they

980
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:32,600
really want you guys off the show we

981
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:34,370

make a fool of ourselves but at this and

984
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:41,870

985
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:44,600
we we had a we had as like it was like a

986
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:47,900
really good learning experience and it

987
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:50,180
was it was fun and after the show we all

988
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:53,570
kind of uh you know we needed to figure

989
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:55,490
it out and at that time DOM and Ryan

990
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:58,000

there short that they were doing and

997
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:13,250
then we just happened to get in touch

00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,380
with DOM and like his his style of

1004
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,609
comedy and stuff like that so we he

1005
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:28,580

00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:32,850
and we hung out Steve Terada came out

1007
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:36,270
and then we just kept in touch yeah

1008
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:38,700
pretty much I was going to live in LA

1009
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:39,840
and Vegas at the same time and I ended

1010
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:42,630
up getting an apartment with him in

1011
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:44,880
North Hollywood and then that's where I

1012
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:49,250
guess that goes back to you right not

1013
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,250
you yeah I was like maybe here's that

1014
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:01,020
maybe the year before and I think I met

1015
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:04,470
you twelve wasn't tendon okay Dana would

1016
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:09,090
know yeah anyway so yeah it was after a

1017
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:11,700
BDC and like YouTube was a pretty big

1018
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:14,010
upcoming thing for Dom and you know he

1019
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:16,590
wanted to spend more time and effort

1020
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:17,970
into it and I was always like confused

1021
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:20,630
about it because I actually studied

1022
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:23,520
video for school I went to college for

1023
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:26,190
digital media and my plan was to you

1024
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:28,710
know do video and then I saw I hear Dom

1025
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:30,770
getting into this YouTube thing he's

1026
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:33,270
doing good and like yeah and he was like

1027
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:35,850
great what kind of camera should I get

1028
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:36,990
and why do you want why do you want this

1029
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:39,119
expensive camera I was getting a little

1030
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:41,790
salty because you know I was like saving

1031
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,650
up all my allowance I didn't get

1032
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:45,510
allowance and I was just like really

1033
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:48,000
excited to get like this you know these

1034
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:49,320
this equipment that Dom was just picking

1035
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,750
up like nothing he had like no interest

1036
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:54,000
and no he was just getting it for this

1037
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:56,400
YouTube thing I had no interest in

1038
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,850
YouTube at the time so I was like okay

1039
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,440
well yeah well if you're just you know

1040
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:04,920
you need this equipment to do this you

1041
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:07,950
need this editing stuff and basically I

1042
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:12,869
was kind of helping Dom in his early

1043
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:16,920
YouTube career and I guess from there he

1044
00:43:12,869 --> 00:43:18,780
and or you guys were getting really into

1045
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:21,270
YouTube and you guys formed like rights

1046
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:23,730
yeah and all that yeah and you guys

1047
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:27,660
needed kind of more help getting stuff

1048
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:29,900
out so Dom offered me you know a place

1049
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:32,200
to stay and out in LA to help him

1050
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:34,690
produce some videos

1051
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:36,220
it they'll do some stuff like that so

1052
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:39,550
you know I didn't have anything planned

1053
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:41,740
but to try and dance some more so I was

1054
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:43,450
just gonna you know I finished my I

1055
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:46,119
finished school and then I was like okay

1056
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:47,859
yeah I just made the leap to move out to

1057
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:49,869
LA and hope you guys yeah I think like a

1058
00:43:47,859 --> 00:43:51,820
pretty big piece of it as well that we

1059
00:43:49,869 --> 00:43:53,410
didn't mention was when we were younger

1060
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:56,589
like when we first started hanging out

1061
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:58,480
right in step boys I was probably like I

1062
00:43:56,589 --> 00:44:03,520
don't know 15 or 16 when I first met

1063
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:05,079
them and we really like Greg was he was

1064
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:08,800
like really always into like filming and

1065
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:10,720
editing and essentially he had like this

1066
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,240
group of literally clowns right so we

1067
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:15,760
would make these really stupid funny

1068
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:17,619
videos for each other which was what we

1069
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,900
did we didn't use YouTube but you would

1070
00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:22,540
he would make them on CDs I would make

1071
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:24,970
them into like yeah DVDs we'd give them

1072
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:27,520
to people yeah yeah and that was kind of

1073
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:28,900
like our version like we weren't on

1074
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,790
YouTube then but that was like what we

1075
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:33,490
were doing so that was like the

1076
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:36,190
correlation between DOM

1077
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:37,569
knowing Greg's value you know because he

1078
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:40,660
was the one that filmed and edited it

1079
00:44:37,569 --> 00:44:41,950
and liked it it was just really stupid

1080
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:45,400
stuff like that we used to do it was

1081
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:47,890
like typical you exactly like early 2005

1082
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:50,440
exactly like this jackass type stuff

1083
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:52,810
yeah like just some stupid skits yeah

1084
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:55,750
and so that was kind of the correlation

1085
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:57,339
between Dom using Greg is like or

1086
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:59,800
wanting to hire him in a sense because

1087
00:44:57,339 --> 00:45:02,410
he knew he was that was what he was into

1088
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:04,630
it was really good at it and and then

1089
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:07,810
well I mean you were living with us

1090
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:09,910
spike you were you were literally on our

1091
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:11,619
couch times we didn't we had to it was a

1092
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:13,540
two-bedroom place me and Dom in a room

1093
00:45:11,619 --> 00:45:17,349
you were just living on our couch and

1094
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:24,280
the couch was not that big it was I'm

1095
00:45:17,349 --> 00:45:27,300
pretty Tom five five and that couch was

1096
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:29,500
like two inches too short for me so I

1097
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:32,109
constantly had to sleep like with a

1098
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:33,970
little kink in my leg and I'm pretty

1099
00:45:32,109 --> 00:45:35,980
sure I got some back problems to be fair

1100
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:38,260
yeah it was a really nice place it was

1101
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:40,240
it wasn't that rough it was we were

1102
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:43,770
coming from where we were like stepboys

1103
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:46,260
yeah it was like it's pretty nice

1104
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:48,840
wait so did you both move to LA at the

1105
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:51,119
same time right Gregg moved before me he

1106
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,920
was because like this point after a BDC

1107
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:55,170
like I didn't go on the show I was still

1108
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,780
in college and we were all like getting

1109
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:59,190
to the point we were really figuring out

1110
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:00,030
we were like kind of becoming adults a

1111
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:01,500
little bit we were figuring out like

1112
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:03,450
what we wanted to do do we want to keep

1113
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,790
pursuing dance professionally Gregg was

1114
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:08,460
like finishing college so is he gonna do

1115
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:11,730
dance or film like everyone was kind of

1116
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:14,220
in that phase and so Gregg had like

1117
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:16,560
after the show you know there we work

1118
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:18,150
might have like done professional in you

1119
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,190
know moving to LA and stuff like that

1120
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:22,530
trying to do more dance but Gregg got

1121
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:25,260
this opportunity to do film with them

1122
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:26,790
and went ahead and then I remember it

1123
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:28,619
was like pretty like a specific time

1124
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:30,420
where Gregg came back and was like this

1125
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:32,670
is what I'm doing and he hit we had like

1126
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:36,060
this talk with all stepboys about like

1127
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:37,530
you know you know push harder like let's

1128
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,850
do some stuff like if you want to do a

1129
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:40,290
dance if you want to be a dancer and

1130
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:42,330
move to LA and dance like we had like

1131
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:43,680
this you know as a serious talk and I

1132
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:45,960
remember thinking like okay I need to

1133
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:48,300
make it change and you know and it

1134
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:50,700
motivated everyone to like lit the fire

1135
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:52,350
and so I just took the leap and I Trant

1136
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:55,500
I was gonna transfer to LA and so I

1137
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:58,340
moved to LA I don't know how many months

1138
00:46:55,500 --> 00:47:01,619
after that would have been probably for

1139
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:02,850
three or four months and I just had just

1140
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:05,430
took the leap and I was gonna transfer

1141
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:07,680
school out there and continue my you

1142
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:10,170
know college education and so that's why

1143
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:12,450
I like I came after yeah but I was like

1144
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:15,000
the instigator I was trying move out the

1145
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:17,220
entire dance crew because they were like

1146
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,530
my only friends I didn't know anyone out

1147
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:21,720
in LA I didn't have no money yeah I

1148
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:23,340
didn't have like anyone only when I had

1149
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:26,250
was dahm dahm was like you know my

1150
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:27,780
saving grace but he was also the only

1151
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:30,540
one only friend that I knew out there

1152
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:32,390
yeah so it was kind of a risky jump I

1153
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:35,760
mean it was just like something that I

1154
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:39,330
was terrified of you know I was leaving

1155
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:42,210
all my family all my friends and all for

1156
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:44,010
this YouTube thing that there was

1157
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:45,960
nothing involved with it there was like

1158
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:47,640
I didn't know if I was gonna get paid I

1159
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,960
didn't know if I was gonna if there's

1160
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:51,150
gonna be a career that I can actually

1161
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:54,180
make money off of or you know be

1162
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:57,480
financially stable from but at the same

1163
00:47:54,180 --> 00:48:00,359
time I kind of just knew that it was

1164
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:04,140
something something I don't know I think

1165
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:06,090
it was just the like it was exactly what

1166
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:08,040
I wanted to do I didn't want to work for

1167
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:10,260
a big company but I also wanted to make

1168
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:12,980
some big stuff like I didn't want to be

1169
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:16,770
held back creatively and I felt like

1170
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:19,320
this kind of it checked all the checks

1171
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:22,080
that I needed in life besides the

1172
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:23,490
paycheck so like I was I was like okay

1173
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,710
you know I'll figure out the money stuff

1174
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:29,160
later as long as I get to make some dope

1175
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:32,220
stuff on in video and you know this is

1176
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:35,369
gonna be worth it yeah so I was like

1177
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:36,600
yeah we'll come out man like we're gonna

1178
00:48:35,369 --> 00:48:40,350
get so much money

1179
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:43,500
we're gonna be alright and I see I

1180
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:45,180
actually we actually got a good portion

1181
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,430
of our dance crew - you know like come

1182
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:49,140
out and I mean like jerel he's with uh

1183
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:50,880
you know he's doing this thing out there

1184
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:53,550
with Dom or he was doing this thing with

1185
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:55,350
Dom there's green yeah they're all kind

1186
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:58,530
of from step boys I mean they are from

1187
00:48:55,350 --> 00:49:00,480
step boys yeah if you see like you know

1188
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:02,700
a lot of people that's in Dom's videos

1189
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:05,430
you know that they're probably from

1190
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:08,280
Sacramento and it's a it's a pretty cool

1191
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:09,480
family that Sacramento if you don't if

1192
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,650
you've never been there it makes sense

1193
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,340
because there's nothing to do out there

1194
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:15,900
so I think that's what we kind of like

1195
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:18,660
there's nothing to do but hone your

1196
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:21,210
crafts and like get better at dancing or

1197
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:23,190
video or whatever so it's there's a cool

1198
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:26,220
place it was a boring place to live but

1199
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:30,030
it was also a very like cultured place

1200
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:31,830
so yeah that's the origin of yeah how we

1201
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:33,270
met Ryan basically yeah and then yeah to

1202
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:35,580
continue the story just a little bit

1203
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:38,190
like after Greg had moved I had moved

1204
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:39,240
shortly after and then like Greg said we

1205
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:41,910
didn't really know anyone

1206
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:45,630
so we me and Greg we'd hung out like

1207
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:49,230
every day yeah and then sometimes since

1208
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:51,359
Brian was Dom's roommate sometimes Dom

1209
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:54,240
would be somewhere else like super busy

1210
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:56,190
so we were hanging out with Ryan like

1211
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,990
because he was at the house and our

1212
00:49:56,190 --> 00:50:00,900
department and and he was obviously

1213
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:03,060
working and doing YouTube stuff and so

1214
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:05,790
it literally just put us in the same

1215
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:07,650
like literally the same room and it just

1216
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:10,530
kind of the same I think the same thing

1217
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:12,540
that connected DOM and

1218
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:15,000
since like the sense of humor like

1219
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:17,310
that's what we shared as well because

1220
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,700
it's it's all from the same dancer

1221
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:22,820
essentially we all it's kind of like a

1222
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:24,690
Malcolm Gladwell's outliers in a way

1223
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:27,480
it's it's a book where it basically

1224
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:29,760
talks about how you are at like the

1225
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:31,410
prime age the youngest point you could

1226
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,480
have been to learn all that you could

1227
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:35,670
and and be in the right place at the

1228
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,960
right time yeah type of thing I think so

1229
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:40,910
yeah yep

1230
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:43,080
I mean I I'm a firm believer of like

1231
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:45,930
there's nothing wrong with hard work I

1232
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:49,550
mean it never really hurt anyone besides

1233
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:51,990
you in your own time and you know yeah I

1234
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:54,780
do agree if we were in the right place

1235
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:56,700
at the right time yeah and it is a very

1236
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:59,280
you know fortunate opportunity for us

1237
00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:01,410
you know Ryan DOM especially given us

1238
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,690
these opportunities but at the same time

1239
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:06,600
if it wasn't for us putting in the hard

1240
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:08,430
work to get us to be you know have some

1241
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:10,260
type of talent in the first place they

1242
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:12,750
probably wouldn't have even you know

1243
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:14,670
thought of us ago and it just had

1244
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:17,460
perfectly lined up too with you because

1245
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:21,630
you were in a phase of your career where

1246
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:22,980
you you did want to like like create

1247
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:25,560
like a small crew to help you produce

1248
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:26,700
more on a more constant basis right

1249
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,350
because if we would have met you like a

1250
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:31,100
year before it would probably been

1251
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:34,470
completely different right um I think

1252
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:36,600
originally I didn't even know Greg could

1253
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:38,010
do what he could do right effects wise I

1254
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:40,050
wanted somebody who could help me shoot

1255
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:42,300
for one yeah and have another you know

1256
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:45,720
bodies around right because it was just

1257
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:47,940
so hard to do everything by yourself and

1258
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:49,350
then when I saw what he could do in

1259
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:51,270
terms of like his filming and now it's

1260
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:52,320
just like how did you make cuz I would

1261
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:54,120
use the camera I would give him my

1262
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:55,260
camera sometimes right and he would get

1263
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:57,720
a shot and I'd be like how did you make

1264
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:59,400
it look so cinematic oh you know you

1265
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,570
just do this and this and this and you

1266
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,730
know he makes the background blurry and

1267
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:03,840
he's just like I stuff up on my own

1268
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:06,120
camera cause I didn't know how to use it

1269
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:08,100
right you know and then I was like when

1270
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:09,930
he kind of showed me that stuff I was

1271
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:12,180
like damn there's so much things I did

1272
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:13,890
not know what's even possible yeah and

1273
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:16,230
that's the main reason why I wanted to

1274
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:18,300
bring Greg on so I think honestly I

1275
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:20,970
think it would have happened still with

1276
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,800
Greg because I was just like so

1277
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:23,970
intrigued with learning like what else

1278
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,619
is possible yeah

1279
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:27,420
like if we kept every single video if

1280
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:28,050
you look it's a progression like from

1281
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,390
year to year

1282
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:32,609
does huge jumps in terms of what we were

1283
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:33,750
doing and it's not necessary like he

1284
00:52:32,609 --> 00:52:35,570
couldn't have done great couldn't have

1285
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:37,500
done it before it's just I was like

1286
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:38,640
literally doing what we do now is like

1287
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:42,000
hey is this possible

1288
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:44,880
how can we do this and you know still

1289
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,740
keep it within our brand right but it

1290
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:50,070
that's how it progressed it was a lot of

1291
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:51,480
I think even you like you know like you

1292
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:53,400
couldn't even compare your knowledge now

1293
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:55,560
to that that version of grey because you

1294
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:57,599
learned so much along the way and you

1295
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:58,740
just kept you know if you didn't know

1296
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,869
something you never said no you just

1297
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:02,369
looked it up figured it out even if

1298
00:53:00,869 --> 00:53:03,750
sometimes it was whack compared to what

1299
00:53:02,369 --> 00:53:04,980
you thought I was gonna be or even for

1300
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:06,810
what I thought was gonna be it's like at

1301
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:09,090
least we got it done you know might not

1302
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:10,590
have been exactly how we pictured but

1303
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:13,290
the fact that you figured out how to do

1304
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:14,490
it is I guess I guess in a way it's it's

1305
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:16,590
a good and bad thing to say

1306
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:19,200
yeah always you're gonna you can make

1307
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:20,700
this happen yeah that comes from I think

1308
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,550
for sure it comes from step boys and

1309
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:26,250
sense of like we we never it was so

1310
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:28,470
weird because our our performance is

1311
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:31,349
like I said they weren't just dance good

1312
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:33,270
but somehow we made it happen to where

1313
00:53:31,349 --> 00:53:36,480
whoever is watching they would either

1314
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:38,820
laugh or understand a story you know and

1315
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:41,400
a big portion of that came from I think

1316
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:42,960
the mentality that we all breeded and

1317
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:45,960
definitely like the older guys for sure

1318
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:48,390
of like take this idea and make it

1319
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:50,880
happen right I think it's just like you

1320
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:53,910
know you can literally make something

1321
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:56,790
out of nothing like you don't need to

1322
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:58,580
have all the skills you don't need to

1323
00:53:56,790 --> 00:54:02,250
have talent you know I mean you have

1324
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:04,890
more so just the willingness and the

1325
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:07,650
drive to be able to you know say okay I

1326
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:09,000
got this well back then it was like you

1327
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:10,830
know if take for example we had this

1328
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:14,400
Dance Crew no one knew how to dance but

1329
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:17,040
we all wanted seriously we all wanted to

1330
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:21,180
put on a good show like we knew what

1331
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:23,849
made us smile and what made us like like

1332
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:27,480
a certain dance performance so we're

1333
00:54:23,849 --> 00:54:29,970
like okay we'll just tweak our abilities

1334
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:33,599
and you know get that same kind of

1335
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:35,460
moment but with our skill levels yeah so

1336
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:36,930
like you know we knew we had one guy

1337
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:37,440
that I had a that could do a backflip

1338
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:39,480
it's

1339
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,329
we utilized that guy a lot because he

1340
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:44,190
was you know it was it gave that idea

1341
00:54:42,329 --> 00:54:47,160
that the entire crew could do backflips

1342
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:49,710
exactly but you know we apply that same

1343
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:52,050
kind of idea to video we're not the best

1344
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:55,410
video makers or I mean we're far from it

1345
00:54:52,050 --> 00:55:01,530
there's like so many good effects guys

1346
00:54:55,410 --> 00:55:04,349
camera people but we try to a man we do

1347
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:06,050
our best to get a really good you know a

1348
00:55:04,349 --> 00:55:09,329
professional look but at the same time

1349
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:11,250
we have the time more than half the time

1350
00:55:09,329 --> 00:55:13,349
69 percent of the time we don't know

1351
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:16,560
what the heck we're doing 69 percent of

1352
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:18,780
the time exhausting just to go back on

1353
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:20,190
to the origin and finish I'll do the

1354
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:22,050
fast version yeah

1355
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:24,569
just so people understand yes I met Greg

1356
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:26,069
first and it was literally on a per

1357
00:55:24,569 --> 00:55:28,650
project basis I was just kind of like

1358
00:55:26,069 --> 00:55:30,690
you know it was more Dom's friend and

1359
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:33,540
then eventually like you know it wasn't

1360
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:35,550
consistent enough for you I think to the

1361
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:38,310
point where like I was using you more

1362
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:40,740
than Dom a little white TF slave you

1363
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:43,319
were I was getting tossed around

1364
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:44,640
actually was it white yet before you

1365
00:55:43,319 --> 00:55:46,829
started working with who was right

1366
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:48,390
during like right during white TF is

1367
00:55:46,829 --> 00:55:50,609
when I moved out like the heart of it

1368
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:52,650
okay so you came on a little after then

1369
00:55:50,609 --> 00:55:55,650
I guess so yeah okay you were the white

1370
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:58,020
TF BTS er yeah yeah if someone needed a

1371
00:55:55,650 --> 00:56:02,250
video in white TF mm-hmm it's probably

1372
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:04,050
my way and then from there you

1373
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:05,369
introduced me to will I mean already

1374
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:06,869
kind of we already kind of met but like

1375
00:56:05,369 --> 00:56:08,700
that's where we started hanging out like

1376
00:56:06,869 --> 00:56:11,579
you said we hung out more yeah after

1377
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:14,160
that we I ended up moving back to Vegas

1378
00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:17,760
because I really did not like living in

1379
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:22,319
LA and you guys came onto and lived at

1380
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:23,849
the cloth which is the don't the cloth

1381
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:26,010
is you know what the cloth is really

1382
00:56:23,849 --> 00:56:28,770
yeah they've heard us say it before so

1383
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:30,690
ok well the club is the first house I

1384
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:32,760
lived in Vegas and it became it the

1385
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:34,099
office essentially I see that coming a

1386
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:36,630
lot like what house is this

1387
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:40,109
yeah anyway I don't think it's ever been

1388
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:42,829
officially addressed as that well the

1389
00:56:40,109 --> 00:56:46,530
scenes before they're exposed to us

1390
00:56:42,829 --> 00:56:49,589
anyway from there so willing Greg are

1391
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:51,450
there I think the next person might have

1392
00:56:49,589 --> 00:56:54,690
been Shaun yeah or was it

1393
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:57,210
Eric was oh yes on visitors no it was

1394
00:56:54,690 --> 00:57:01,800
Sean no Sean visited and then he went

1395
00:56:57,210 --> 00:57:03,780
back he was still in college yeah I

1396
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:05,790
think it was Sean we were saying you

1397
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:07,200
were like around with Derek a lot

1398
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:08,970
because he already lived in Las Vegas

1399
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:12,570
yeah he was doing his own YouTube stuff

1400
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:14,130
anyway to help him fort after I'm gonna

1401
00:57:12,570 --> 00:57:16,680
I'm just gonna say Sean I think it was

1402
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:18,540
Sean okay Sean finished college and he

1403
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:20,100
hit me up well I hit him up to I was

1404
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:21,630
just like I always told him from the

1405
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:23,550
last time he visited like if you ever

1406
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:26,310
want to get back into making some videos

1407
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:27,690
and stuff like that like come come

1408
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:28,920
through you know like we have a place

1409
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:32,280
like because they were seeing at the

1410
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:34,470
house and you know we had some room and

1411
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:37,890
he says yeah I was I'm interested in

1412
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:40,020
that I don't think he he what he at the

1413
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:42,510
time he was very not interested I think

1414
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:43,830
he was just so over college yeah he was

1415
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:45,240
over school that's why he really wanted

1416
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:49,410
to do it and then now obviously he's

1417
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:52,440
back interested in again but so Sean was

1418
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:55,110
there and then eventually you guys moved

1419
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:56,880
out right it was like this weird thing

1420
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:59,340
where everybody except Derek lived at

1421
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:02,670
the club yeah yeah at some point anyway

1422
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:04,950
Sean came in Derek had just finished a

1423
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:08,280
job that he was working with the job

1424
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:10,050
walk he's dancing in a Vegas show but it

1425
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:12,690
was just about to be renewed or the show

1426
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:14,550
was just ending and he had the option to

1427
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:17,130

so he brought in Derek from there was it

1435
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:38,340

was Dana was before Josh no I don't

1438
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:45,600

00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:48,900
Booher he was a brief period of time but

1440
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:50,970

00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:53,880
through internet icon and how was a

1442
00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:58,080
thing and it's also where I met also

1443
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:59,670
where I met Paco alumni but yeah I think

1444
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:03,630
Josh was here for a little bit

1445
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:05,100
Dana came in because of Greg essentially

1446
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:07,200
she was coming here

1447
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:09,390
what was the reasoning for coming here I

1448
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,950
mean design right yeah it was interior

1449
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:14,850
design but also you know we're doing

1450
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:16,650
like a long term relationship and turn

1451
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:19,560
suit for one well we'll talk about that

1452
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:21,330
next but uh yeah

1453
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:28,560
why'd you say it like that I was like in

1454
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:30,240
agreement oh yeah I mean we might have

1455
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:34,350
to talk about it on a different one sure

1456
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:36,150
yeah yeah okay so Dana and then Josh

1457
00:59:34,350 --> 00:59:41,130

01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:24,720
that's that's one other thing he rented

1478
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:27,360
a car drove all the way out from LA just

1479
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,860
to come be on set and help us for free I

1480
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:31,670
wasn't paying him it just came to I was

1481
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:34,590
like Dan this is a really hard-working

1482
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:36,780
cool dude like who does that he kind of

1483
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:40,680
reminded me yeah yeah he just like

1484
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:42,750
giving up some of his this time and and

1485
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:45,000
you know just dedicating it towards

1486
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:47,070
bettering himself yeah and I was like

1487
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:49,290
this is very impressive it was like a

1488
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:50,940
two-day shoot I believe right no you

1489
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:53,040
guys were shooting for four days yeah

1490
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:55,020
but you hit me up on the first day and I

1491
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:57,930
do remember the second day when we're

1492
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:59,430
filming at the time I think you fell

1493
01:00:57,930 --> 01:01:00,600
asleep during the shoot or something

1494
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:02,130
like that something like that happened

1495
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:04,380
and we were all like you know whatever

1496
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:06,930
cuz we're free yeah and he drove the

1497
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:08,460
whole time yeah I think it was the end

1498
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:10,260
of that day because I had just a ride

1499
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:12,810
and we went to shoot like right away

1500
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:14,550
yeah he fell asleep in the shoot and

1501
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:15,960
normally I'd be like oh that's if he was

1502
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:19,350
working for us but that's weird but

1503
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:22,500
little did we know inside well anyway

1504
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:24,240
we'll of all people was like I was like

1505
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:26,220
hey do you think it's worth like week

1506
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:28,200
Josh just left we could bring this guy

1507
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:30,690
on board like he we could use the hands

1508
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:32,520
like if he edits I know he did at it

1509
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:33,690
because he was making videos of his own

1510
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:36,780
I guess

1511
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:38,840
jammed and will was the number one

1512
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:41,190
person like fight he was like this is no

1513
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:43,140
help yeah because I was like messaging

1514
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:45,120
him like a good job when coming out like

1515
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:47,760
we really appreciate the topic shocked

1516
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:49,860
yeah you know if you keep coming around

1517
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:51,390
like that's how you know that's how it

1518
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:52,890
always his work like Derek was gone for

1519
01:01:51,390 --> 01:01:55,050
a long time and he just helped in

1520
01:01:52,890 --> 01:01:56,190
exactly and then that's exactly what I

1521
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:58,470
told him was like you keep coming out

1522
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:59,760
and killing it like of course you know

1523
01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:02,180
something's bound to happen you know

1524
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:05,430
it's like and that's what happened

1525
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:07,260
but anyway Paco ended up being a part of

1526
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:13,020
the group yeah

1527
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:21,870
oh well he's in pocket Paco's in and

1528
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:24,540
that's pretty much how he got in but I

1529
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:25,650
think we found because I was always

1530
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:28,560
trying to find out I was like okay so

1531
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:30,420
you don't want to write because what for

1532
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:31,740
me like I mean I was like okay so you

1533
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:33,930
don't want to edit you have such a

1534
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:35,640
specific I do have a very specific are

1535
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:39,600
you write its I know that's why I

1536
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:51,110
writing for Ryan is tough it's it takes

1537
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:55,620
a genius no no it's just big Rhino

1538
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:59,430
genius guys know it's hard because I'm

1539
01:02:55,620 --> 01:03:01,740
very particular in what I like might not

1540
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:03,600
always make sense to people but it's

1541
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:05,640
just I'm just very picky even if it's

1542
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:09,480
down to a point one second cut it makes

1543
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:11,040
a difference to me it does I mean once a

1544
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:14,700
I will say the last thing that Greg was

1545
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:16,590
talking about a little bit was like

1546
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:18,600
Greg's value and it was that he was like

1547
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:20,280
super into filming and editing and stuff

1548
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:22,350
like that and people recognize that when

1549
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:24,210
I came on like I didn't do any film I

1550
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:25,890
didn't do any editing like we wrote

1551
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:27,510
something a little bit in the beginning

1552
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:30,150
and I think hopefully like I like to

1553
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:32,850
think that that probably at least put me

1554
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:33,060
on the radar but literally if you want

1555
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:35,940
to

1556
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:38,280
learn something it's aunt like online is

1557
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:39,690
the determination and just wanting to

1558
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:42,060
learn something yeah because I learned

1559
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:43,890
everything from Greg from Ryan from

1560
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:45,960
online like searching and just like

1561
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:47,850
literally just wanting and like pursuing

1562
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:49,260
it so it's it's possible like I didn't

1563
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:53,190
know how to edit I didn't know how to

1564
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:55,530
film and motivational podcasts yeah we

1565
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:58,980
have those now we are this kind of

1566
01:03:55,530 --> 01:04:01,140
turned in today just take out the whole

1567
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:03,300
first half just continue from this book

1568
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:05,460
yeah just cause stepboys the movie and

1569
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:06,900
it's just like about inspiration like

1570
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:08,520
about a dance crew that didn't know how

1571
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:11,190
to dance

1572
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:16,620
and they all ended up doing like kind of

1573
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:18,810
big things I don't know everybody but I

1574
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:20,850
mean the one guy sings you know some

1575
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:23,790

1576
01:04:20,850 --> 01:04:25,380

Chippendales so yeah Oh real Vegas show

1579
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:31,860
like it's not a joke

1580
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:34,770
yeah well anyway we could talk a whole

1581
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:37,110
lot more but we've hit about the hour

1582
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:39,480
mark which means we don't have time for

1583
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:44,120
Twitter questions we all let's just do

1584
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:44,120
some rapid fire

1585
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:50,670
I guess one no no just go through it

1586
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,380
real quick no with the one we'll do one

1587
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:54,420
and we're gonna pull it from the reddit

1588
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:56,700
page and we're gonna I guess we're gonna

1589
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:58,440
open it up now I don't really I have it

1590
01:04:56,700 --> 01:05:03,630
we're gonna start utilizing it things

1591
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:06,060
using shows but what is like do you

1592
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:07,500
watch the old videos still because I

1593
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:09,000
know sometimes you guys do you cringe at

1594
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:11,430
it which one is your favorite one and I

1595
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,110
want to go in order of Greg will and in

1596
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:15,090
Ryan honestly I will say something quick

1597
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:16,710
about this oh that's the one thing

1598
01:05:15,090 --> 01:05:18,540
that's crazy about like I feel like the

1599
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:20,430
work that I've done with Ryan is a lot

1600
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:22,710
of time if I watch old videos I don't

1601
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:24,060
cringe if it was like something I made

1602
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:25,530
like a long time ago for sure I would

1603
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:27,000
cringe at it but that's why it's like I

1604
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:30,120
know it's not being really special

1605
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:32,520
because I don't know I said they hold up

1606
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:35,760
yeah they really do there's some videos

1607
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:37,590
that I cringe I do add a lot of them

1608
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:40,290
some people are better than obviously

1609
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:42,800
some bears but so which ones are your

1610
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:42,800
favorites then

1611
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:48,900
stole it the good one oh my god

1612
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:51,030
everybody okay we got to say this

1613
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:53,100
because people for whatever reason the

1614
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:54,900
ones we love right especially for me and

1615
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:57,210
Greg when we're editing we're like dying

1616
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:58,950
sometimes and we're like oh no we're

1617
01:05:57,210 --> 01:06:02,100
laughing so hard no one's gonna like

1618
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:03,990
this never all the ones we love like so

1619
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:05,760
many of them I know even the ones that

1620
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:07,260
I'm like oh this is so bad and we're

1621
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:10,050
like that means it's gonna do good you

1622
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:12,150
know and for whatever reason being Greg

1623
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:13,880
and that final edit if we're dying we're

1624
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:17,490
like great no one's gonna get this

1625
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:19,170
there's literally like videos that you

1626
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:21,210
guys probably don't know exist that

1627
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:25,560
they're my favorite videos just because

1628
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:30,240
they're so deep yep but I would say my

1629
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:34,470
favorite video would probably be man we

1630
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:36,780
meet some man there was 100 was the

1631
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:45,300
scary one we did with Kyle all the

1632
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:51,750
paranormal writers yeah that's not my

1633
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:54,600
favorite as far as something I was the

1634
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:58,230
most proud of I mean it was probably

1635
01:06:54,600 --> 01:07:01,860
yeah it would probably have to be like

1636
01:06:58,230 --> 01:07:03,270
one of the big videos I meant like candy

1637
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:05,000
crush that was like a really that was

1638
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:07,830
the one I was gonna say that was like a

1639
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,630
transitional video for us I think were

1640
01:07:07,830 --> 01:07:11,490
you yeah that's when I was like holy

1641
01:07:09,630 --> 01:07:13,410
crap you just created a world

1642
01:07:11,490 --> 01:07:14,940
yeah and like we never did anything like

1643
01:07:13,410 --> 01:07:17,730
that and I was like if you can do this

1644
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:20,730
and then and then that was your downfall

1645
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:22,110
cuz I'm like great can do this that

1646
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:24,240
means you can do all these other things

1647
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:26,310
and then yeah it just spiraled from

1648
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,900
there yeah I was gonna say candy crush

1649
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:31,980
actually god that was the person I was

1650
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:34,140
like yeah super cool

1651
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:36,510
but then that's another one we go back I

1652
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:38,430
don't cringe but I'm like oh this is

1653
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:40,200
compared to some of the stuff he's doing

1654
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:42,630
now in terms of the effects I'm like oh

1655
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:43,500
this is nothing now right but I mean

1656
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:46,470
still it's not nothing

1657
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:48,570
yeah you know even even if you just like

1658
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:49,950
put it during that time where you know

1659
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:52,950
effects we're still pretty new for

1660
01:07:49,950 --> 01:07:54,900
YouTube videos yeah it's not anything

1661
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:57,330
good but it was decent for the time for

1662
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:58,800
us it was good yeah yeah there was like

1663
01:07:57,330 --> 01:08:00,780
I think at the time Freddie Wong was

1664
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:02,520
doing crazier stuff and was like well

1665
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:05,070
that's his gimmick you know our gimmick

1666
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:06,840
is not even about effects just supposed

1667
01:08:05,070 --> 01:08:08,790
to enhance the comedy corridor has

1668
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:10,260
always been some they were wrong before

1669
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:11,610
Freddie right yeah I mean they're low

1670
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:13,890
they were working with yeah yeah yeah

1671
01:08:11,610 --> 01:08:16,319
and they've always been like killing the

1672
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:17,880
game yeah some like some YouTube channel

1673
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:20,520
that I always looked up to

1674
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:23,460
can i machine-gun knees no we're out of

1675
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:25,529
time what was your first job um gift

1676
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:28,710
wrapper at the mall they strap gifts

1677
01:08:25,529 --> 01:08:31,259
nice time no let's just go quick ones

1678
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:33,930
quick ones how did you meet Dana awesome

1679
01:08:31,259 --> 01:08:42,540
dance class when's the next episode of

1680
01:08:33,930 --> 01:08:44,750
willing Greg show mm and then I think

1681
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:46,680
one last thing that I wanted to say is

1682
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:48,390
we're out of time sorry I know we're out

1683
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:50,339
of time no I'm just getting go ahead but

1684
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:51,720
uh because the reason why I chose the

1685
01:08:50,339 --> 01:08:54,000
question of what was your guys favorite

1686
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:59,400
old videos is that because you recently

1687
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:05,430
announced that you were dating Arden I

1688
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:07,259
just didn't watch this if you know it I

1689
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:09,930
thought it would be kind of cool to see

1690
01:09:07,259 --> 01:09:16,040
both you and Arden react to agents of

1691
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:21,049
secret stuff is just you pitch an idea

1692
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:21,049
well we had previously talked about this

1693
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:27,720
but I just I don't think it's a I don't

1694
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:29,310
want to I know you don't

1695
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:31,759
yeah that actually is one I would cringe

1696
01:09:29,310 --> 01:09:35,190
at I cringe at agent secret stuff anyway

1697
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:36,779
I'm like yeah he says oh if he skits

1698
01:09:35,190 --> 01:09:38,130
it's one of those videos oh it gets so

1699
01:09:36,779 --> 01:09:39,540
many legs you guys would do it but I

1700
01:09:38,130 --> 01:09:41,940
really don't want to so I'm gonna say

1701
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:49,109
like I don't even know what our podcast

1702
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:50,220
gets normally but double it triple it it

1703
01:09:49,109 --> 01:09:53,609
has to be in the first week cause you

1704
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:55,680

1705
01:09:53,609 --> 01:09:57,180

01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:11,040
okay well yeah I like a lot for a

1711
01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:12,210
podcast that's pretty unrealistic

1712
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:18,450
drop it down a little bit all right

1713
01:10:12,210 --> 01:10:23,100
