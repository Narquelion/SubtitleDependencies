00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,910
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,059
welcome back to my youtube channel so

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,059
[Music]

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,950
cutting right to the point because

5
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:12,870
today's video is definitely gonna be a

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,429
pretty long one as you can see by the

7
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,039
title below this is going to be a

8
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:20,010
full-on unbiased review of the brand new

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,480
venti by ariana makeup collection so

10
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,430
Vinci PD actually had their launch party

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,350
last night in New York City and launched

12
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,269
this before at midnight and Rihanna had

13
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,859
a big event in Manhattan with a

14
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:30,660
beautiful yellow gown which is why I'm

15
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,980
wearing this yellow hoodie today which

16
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,500
you'll be finding out a lot more about

17
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,420
in Monday's video so stay tuned but

18
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,610
guess who is not invited to that launch

19
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,469
party this sister right here so this

20
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,790
morning I hauled my ass out of bed at 6

21
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:43,230
a.m. to go to Sephora because they

22
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,530
invited a bunch of influencers in for

23
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,450
early access and I picked up the entire

24
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,980
line I paid for everything one of these

25
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,390
products myself this video is not

26
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,010
sponsored and I'm not being paid to talk

27
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,570
about it either I just want to do this

28
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,710
video because so many of you guys are

29
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,460
wondering whether or not these products

30
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,260
are gonna be good

31
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,760
I myself I'm generally wondering if

32
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,219
these products are gonna be good the

33
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,470
fancy beauty campaigns have looked so so

34
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,090
beautiful so many beautiful models so

35
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,280
much diversity as well and the products

36
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,290
generally do look really really good but

37
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,030
I don't want to be biased I'm going in

38
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,159
with absolutely no knowledge of anything

39
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,939
so without further ado grab your pink

40
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,530
kitty drink at ease and let's go ahead

41
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,960
and get started with testing fenty

42
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,310
beauty products alright guys so you know

43
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,540
that I haven't been really using primer

44
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,310
so much lately I've just been loving

45
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,810
using a moisturize skin or right under

46
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,640
my foundation I feel like it just makes

47
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,970
my skin look so so beautiful and

48
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,829
flawless but 20 Beauty did drop a soft

49
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,970
matte primer so I already went ahead and

50
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,950
I moisturize and we're gonna be putting

51
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,689
this on top before the foundation today

52
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,549
so all the different products come in at

53
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:44,700
this design of a unicorn it is this like

54
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:46,170
off-white black spot an ombre pattern

55
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,180
honestly the packaging looks absolutely

56
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,149
stunning and let's go ahead and take it

57
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:54,000
oh oh wow this looks really good so I'm

58
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,710
fancy viacom this primer retails for $32

59
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,960
and it comes with one point zero eight

60
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,640
fluid ounces which is actually more than

61
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,530
the typical foundation most foundations

62
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,030
are usually one fluid ounce so there's

63
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,170
definitely a lot of product in here I'm

64
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,750
just gonna go ahead and I'm going to

65
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:10,080
store some on my hands as usual and then

66
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,700
just apply them to my face okay so I

67
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,990
definitely just applied way too much

68
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,240
that to my face that are it's gonna blow

69
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,400
in really really well there isn't too

70
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,740
much of like a strong smell but it does

71
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,030
smell slightly like lotion but like a

72
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,550
really really good lotion so it's

73
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:26,100
definitely a nice clean scent that isn't

74
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:28,620
overpowering oh and it does make my skin

75
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,870
feel very very smooth and also a little

76
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,240
bit tacky so this should make my makeup

77
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,980
stick hopefully pretty well I am so

78
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,180
annoyed right now like I said I went to

79
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,530
Sephora this morning to get the

80
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,290
foundation it to show you guys the full

81
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,130
range so I got shade number 100 being

82
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,560
the lightest shade

83
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:46,290
and number 490 being the darkest shade

84
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,900
of my dumb ass instead of getting my

85
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:53,070
shade which I determined was number 260

86
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:56,130
I bought to number hundreds are we

87
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,420
surprised no but are we annoyed yes

88
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:00,030
because I have to go all the way back

89
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,140
there so so you guys are not gonna see

90
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,150
any time passed because there's gonna be

91
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:06,900
a jump cut but my eyes will be back in

92
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:08,970
about two hours - as they do alright so

93
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,470
- very very long overrides later we are

94
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,680
back home and I have the right

95
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:15,690
foundation shade this time number 260

96
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,700
that's like classic James sorry but

97
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,780
flashback Mary was clearly really trying

98
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,740
to make it appearance I've been here but

99
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,750
not today

100
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,250
the nextstep is obviously going to be a

101
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,220
foundation and for today I bought you

102
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,750
guys three shades and I got number 260

103
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,550
for myself I did do some swatches in

104
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,930
Sephora but lord knows the lighting in

105
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,910
there is not the best so fingers crossed

106
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,680
this one works but I also picked up

107
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:37,260
number 100 which is the lightest shade

108
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,550
and number 490 which is the darkest

109
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,410
shade so I could show you guys the full

110
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,540
range I also went ahead and I picked up

111
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,920
the precision makeup sponge which I

112
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,170
guess is supposed to be like a Beauty

113
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,090
Blender type situation it comes in the

114
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,530
philip ox and then is in this package so

115
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,570
it is basically like a Beauty Blender

116
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,220
but it has flat edges so I'm just going

117
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:55,410
to go ahead and it actually sounds like

118
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,480
a bouquet of flowers weird enough but

119
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,560
like it smells good I'm gonna go ahead

120
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,120
and wet this before I apply my

121
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,440
foundation so if we're actually applying

122
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,700
the foundation I do definitely talk

123
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,010
about the shade range because it has

124
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,360
been a very very controversial topic so

125
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,100
I do want to swatch for you guys the

126
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,960
three different colors that I got today

127
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,720
so this is shade number 100 which is the

128
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:15,300
lightest shade on the top this one is

129
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,100
number 260 which fingers crossed should

130
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,049
be my shade hopefully

131
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,720
and this last sheet on the bottom is

132
00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:23,760
number 490 which is the darkest shade

133
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,410
in the range I want to make it very very

134
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,210
clear that I'm obviously not a person of

135
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,980
color and I'm nowhere near as well I

136
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,600
simply wanted to swatch the darker shade

137
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,190
just to give you guys a good comparison

138
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,380
from the darkest to the lightest and

139
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,640
show the variation between them but I am

140
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,110
well aware that this watch on my

141
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,300
skintone is not going to be helpful at

142
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,920
all to my dark beauties out there so

143
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,000
while I was in Sephora today I did

144
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,830
happen to run in one of my amazing

145
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,970
sisters shout out to you a sister

146
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,900
julienne she definitely saw me

147
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,430
struggling with what to do with this

148
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,840
foundation so she actually went ahead

149
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,100
and let me swatch it on her hand

150
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,750
so hopefully this next step will give

151
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,130
you guys a better idea if you do have

152
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,960
darker skin on what this foundation will

153
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,520
actually look like alright guys I'm here

154
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,260
at plenty beauty and support to pick up

155
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,210
all the items early this morning and I'm

156
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,710
here with sister Jolene I want to show

157
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,000
you guys the darker shade in the range

158
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,590
because there are so many but obviously

159
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,240
I'm Pacey so I'm glad about the swatches

160
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,580
are you [ __ ] on me because but doesn't

161
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,950
help anybody so sister Tati is gonna

162
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,780
hold my camera for me a little swatch to

163
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,730
Devon today alright guys so this is

164
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,380
shades are bent 490 which is the darkest

165
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,000
in the range and to be clear we're on

166
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,560
essentially did run out of more shape as

167
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,850
well those definitely controversy on

168
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,560
Twitter when it comes to makeup but

169
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:26,510
literally 1s or not so we're gonna be

170
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,510
watching this sister Lena right here

171
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,350
before looks definitely pretty liquidy

172
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,669
and as you can tell this is a little bit

173
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:36,040
darker than her skin tone and this is

174
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:37,120
definitely a warm tone shade too alright

175
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,050
so now that that's taken care of let's

176
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,810
go ahead and actually apply the

177
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:42,460
foundation like I said I am number 260

178
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,530
and this foundation comes with one point

179
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,570
zero eight fluid ounces so same exact

180
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,610
thing as the primer but this one is $34

181
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:50,290
rather than the primer is 32 I'm just

182
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,449
gonna dip in with my venti Beauty sponge

183
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,740
and go right in on at the skin alright

184
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:55,330
so first impressions is that this color

185
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,860
is a pretty good match to my skin so

186
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,810
thank God the sephora lighting to not do

187
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,810
me too dirty today but fingers crossed

188
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:03,729
that it does not oxidize I'm already not

189
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,860
really loving this sponge

190
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:07,150
it's definitely leaving like imprint as

191
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,860
you can see like right there where I'm

192
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,660
tapping it in and I think that's because

193
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,070
this does have a flat edge to it which

194
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,660
would be really really helpful for doing

195
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,520
like under-eye concealer I feel like but

196
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,900
I feel like the flash is definitely

197
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,270
leaving some weird imprints in the

198
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,100
foundation so I'm not sure if I really

199
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,539
like this alright so that was about

200
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,280
three pumps this is what I normally do

201
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:26,169
for my foundation but we are nowhere

202
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,970
even close to being a full coverage yet

203
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:29,410
I literally only covered one cheek and

204
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:32,350
like this area on this side of the face

205
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:33,729
so I am gonna do a little bit more so

206
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,260
that is one coat of foundation fully

207
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:37,419
applied all over the face and it's

208
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,680
giving me like very medium coverage I am

209
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:40,870
definitely gonna add a little bit more

210
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,580
in areas that are still a little bit

211
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,500
see-through but honestly first

212
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,389
impressions I really like how this

213
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,010
foundation looks alright so that's the

214
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:49,270
foundation all applied and obviously we

215
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:51,430
have to wear this and see how it works

216
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:53,770
throughout the day but initial reactions

217
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,060
is that I really really like it it looks

218
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,160
really really good on my skintone my

219
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,539
skin feels nice and smooth and it feels

220
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,740
very very weightless too like I don't

221
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:01,330
feel like I'm wearing a lot of

222
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,860
foundation despite the fact that I

223
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,599
definitely just had to do like 10 or 15

224
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:07,030
pumps of this to get full coverage which

225
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:08,320
definitely is a con so if you're okay

226
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,849
with using a lot of foundation to cover

227
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,410
yourself with still feeling light that's

228
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:12,700
good but just know that you're only

229
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,950
getting one point zero eight fluid

230
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,849
ounces for the price pretty good but

231
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,169
still you're gonna use a lot of

232
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:18,849
foundation so you could go through this

233
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:20,200
very very quickly so the next up is

234
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:21,490
gonna be to conceal and contour my face

235
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,380
but I'm actually gonna skip out on

236
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,270
concealing for just one second actually

237
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,889
move to contour because today we're

238
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:29,110
gonna be using a cream contour from

239
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:31,720
Fenty Beauty and this is the match stick

240
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,830
and the shade suede each one of these

241
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,150
little cream sticks comes for

242
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,789
twenty-five dollars each and you get

243
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:38,979
0.25 ounces of product so definitely not

244
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,449
a whole lot but let's go ahead and cream

245
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:41,439
contour our face today

246
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:42,999
it's gonna blend this out using the

247
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,319
sponge alright so as you can see I just

248
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:45,550
tried to blend that in but instead of

249
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,139
really like blending in it kind of

250
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,939
disappeared and I think that's because

251
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:51,039
the foundation is getting layered over

252
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:52,360
top of it this sponge is obviously

253
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,639
soaking up a lot of product which is

254
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,309
definitely why it took 10 to 15 squirts

255
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,599
of foundation to get full coverage but I

256
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:59,860
think we got a switch over to my regular

257
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:01,900
beauty blender to finish blending this

258
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,159
out let's try this again okay I'm not

259
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,330
loving this

260
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:05,830
it's definitely blending out a lot

261
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:07,569
easier using my regular Beauty Blender

262
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:09,729
as opposed to the venti Beauty sponge

263
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:11,860
but honestly I'm still really not loving

264
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:13,689
this I'm having to pound really really

265
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,699
hard to even get the product to move I

266
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:17,650
really kind of already dried down

267
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:19,330
completely which for the foundation I

268
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:20,830
like because I have not set my face yet

269
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:24,400
with powder but it looks really really

270
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:25,960
good alright I'm back my camera decided

271
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,150
of course literally what else would go

272
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,560
wrong today at this point but I did just

273
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:32,019
go ahead and apply my concealer which

274
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,729
was a tar shape tape I was gonna pick up

275
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:35,529
one of the matchsticks similar to the

276
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:36,760
cream contour and a concealer but I'll

277
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:38,320
just be straight up I tried it in

278
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,849
support today and I absolutely hated the

279
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,709
formula I just felt as though it wasn't

280
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:43,329
soft enough to be able to really use for

281
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:44,529
under-eye concealer I just thought I was

282
00:08:43,329 --> 00:08:46,180
gonna take off the foundation and

283
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:47,920
honestly at this point I'm really really

284
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,899
glad I went with that decision because

285
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,510
obviously I did not really like this

286
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:55,750
formula and using its shape tape with

287
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:57,339
this fancy foundation looks so good like

288
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,139
my skin looks absolutely phenomenal

289
00:08:57,339 --> 00:09:01,660
right now I have not even set with any

290
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:03,550
powder I'm not creasing it it dried down

291
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:05,170
to like a semi matte finish it's not

292
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:07,510
completely matte but it's also a

293
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,100
slightest bit dewy this looks really

294
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,449
good alright so next I'm gonna go in and

295
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,889
I'm going to set my face so to do that

296
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:14,800
I'm gonna be using the fenty Beauty

297
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:16,870
invisi matte universal blotting powder

298
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,540
and there's only one shade in this and

299
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:21,940
it is very very light so I am praying

300
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,470
that flash like Mary does not come I

301
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,600
mean she clearly was trying it with a

302
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:27,370
shade 100 of the foundation so fingers

303
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,829
crossed that this does not give us the

304
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:32,500
worst luck ever under cinder grab my

305
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:34,329
morphe i'm a 335 brush and tap into this

306
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,769
and i'm going to use this to set

307
00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:37,600
underneath my eyes just make sure that I

308
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:39,579
don't get any creases I'm next just

309
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,230
gonna grab my morphe m14 one and dip

310
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,240
into the pan to set the rest my face and

311
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,410
whoa as you can see when you dip the

312
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,959
brush in it definitely comes off as a

313
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:48,670
white powder this is getting very very

314
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,750
scary but when you blend it and I'm

315
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:53,689
assuming it turns

316
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,800
pretty transparent yeah so hopefully we

317
00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:56,269
will get any flower shock but like I

318
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,750
said I will definitely take a photo and

319
00:09:56,269 --> 00:10:00,589
show you guys in a few or short seconds

320
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,639
alright so as you can see for the photos

321
00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:03,889
I just inserted this powder is

322
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:05,449
definitely flashback proof thank God

323
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:07,279
where I lightly dusted the powder just

324
00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:08,779
to set my face and modify it my skin

325
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,029
tone looked exactly the same so if that

326
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:12,199
is an A+ and where I did really really

327
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:14,209
pack it on being the center of the

328
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:16,100
forehead chin and under the eyes like I

329
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:17,720
normally do it did flash back the

330
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,189
slightest bit and light not my skin tone

331
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,379
but that's exactly what I wanted it to

332
00:10:19,189 --> 00:10:23,000
do so this powder is a major win and

333
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:25,399
definitely going in my bag when I go

334
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,810
places as well for light touch-ups okay

335
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:29,689
so now that my face is all set in place

336
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:31,220
oh we love a good poet I'm gonna quickly

337
00:10:29,689 --> 00:10:33,110
go ahead and do my brows off-camera

338
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,579
fenty did not launch any brow products

339
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:36,050
with this original lion so I'm just

340
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:37,579
gonna use my normal benefit brow poets

341
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,500
and I'll be right back to start off the

342
00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:41,180
eyes alright so I just went ahead and I

343
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,740
did my brows off-camera quickly to save

344
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,379
time and then I just stir on this

345
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:46,850
orangie Brown halo eye with the fenty

346
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:48,529
launched she actually did not launch any

347
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:51,050
eye shadow palettes or single shadows

348
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:52,579
just highlighters so I wanted to throw

349
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:55,250
this on as a base and then I'm gonna

350
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:57,769
grab the matchstick not the concealer in

351
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:00,470
the shade star-struck which is like this

352
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:02,300
pinky glittery shade it honestly

353
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,379
swatches really really beautifully and

354
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,720
I'm pretty sure this is less be used as

355
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:07,850
a cream highlighter for the cheeks but

356
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,959
it is definitely a little bit darker for

357
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,850
my skin tone as you can see when I

358
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,319
rotate my hand it definitely gives that

359
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,819
grey cast that nobody wants for a

360
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:15,350
highlighter so this is definitely look a

361
00:11:13,819 --> 00:11:17,180
lot better on darker skins but I'm gonna

362
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:19,370
use it to highlight the center of my

363
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:21,800
eyelids today now it looks really good

364
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:24,259
oh my gosh I'm just gonna grab my morphe

365
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,089
m22 4 brush and dip into the top of that

366
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:29,029
cream highlighter and just use this to

367
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:30,529
blend out the edges lightly oh this is

368
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:32,000
really pretty I'm also gonna grab my

369
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:33,949
pinky finger and try applying it this

370
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,990
way too to see how that works this is a

371
00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:37,160
match stick as well so it's also $25

372
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:40,220
like I said for the first one the cream

373
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,689
contour and a fun side note these are

374
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,920
magnetic and stick together which i

375
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:45,139
think is so cool and a really good

376
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,029
storage option as well so major points

377
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:48,920
to them for that so those are the eyes

378
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:50,750
all complete I'm absolutely loving how

379
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,920
this is turning out so far and now we're

380
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,449
onto the stuff that we've all been

381
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,240
waiting for and that is the highlighter

382
00:11:53,449 --> 00:11:57,379
and I am so so so excited for this so

383
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,360
frenchie beauty actually launched a few

384
00:11:57,379 --> 00:12:01,880
different highlighters retailing at $34

385
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,740
each and you get 0.12 ounces of product

386
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,050
and I actually picked up two of

387
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:07,430
this duo comes with two shades being a

388
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,710
lightning dust and fire crystal

389
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:11,390
definitely plus for the names please

390
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:13,490
excuse my crusty ass bandit but here's a

391
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:15,830
shade lightning dust swatch we're gonna

392
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:17,600
do it right here

393
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,710
that's not even showing up on camera and

394
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,430
it's actually really not that pigmented

395
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:21,710
in real life

396
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:23,510
- okay and then here's the shade of fire

397
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:25,130
crystal also swatched

398
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,600
alright so fire crystals definitely a

399
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:28,670
lot more pigmented and a little bit more

400
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,900
glittery than lightning dust days I'm

401
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:31,370
actually pretty disappointed in

402
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,990
lightning dust it really does not show

403
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:34,790
up that well on camera or in real life

404
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,110
so if you want a more subtle highlighter

405
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:38,870
this may be for you but when you're like

406
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:40,550
me and you like a blinding glow I think

407
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:42,080
we might be going for a fire crystal but

408
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,300
even this is really not that landing

409
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,500
either the second highlighter however is

410
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,630
when we've been waiting for and this is

411
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,400
what I am so so excited to use today and

412
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:51,740
that is the single highlighter in the

413
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:54,620
shade trophy wife it is this like

414
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:58,600
metallic ass gold shade that is I guess

415
00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:00,920
more even glittery than hi lady oh

416
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,570
you're kidding Wow

417
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,010
so readö is actually writing this exact

418
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:06,020
highlighter at last night at the event

419
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:07,310
which looked so beyond stunning and

420
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,570
after being a little bit of research

421
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,860
what I'm gathering is that this

422
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,990
highlighter is actually more of like a

423
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,000
glittery base rather than an actual like

424
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,470
shimmer base so when you put it on it's

425
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,360
supposed to actually disperse more like

426
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:19,310
real glitter and look like your face is

427
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,290
like literally glittery rather than like

428
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:23,270
glowing so definitely not for the

429
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:25,400
everyday person but y'all know me I love

430
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,570
to be extra AF and I am so excited to

431
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,140
try this and let's give her a little bit

432
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:32,030
of a swatch with a clean finger oh

433
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,680
you're kidding let's go ahead and move

434
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:38,510
the Cartier bracelet down and do a

435
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:39,890
little oh wow I don't know if it's

436
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,300
picking up on camera but in real life

437
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:44,720
you can see the individual glitter

438
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:48,170
particles like shining and that is so

439
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,490
stunning oh my god I am so pumped for

440
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:52,100
this I'm gonna go in with my morphe M

441
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:53,450
501 brush and dip into trophy wife and

442
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,920
see how this looks

443
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:56,390
alright so the highlighter is definitely

444
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,220
there was only one swipe and I'm already

445
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,780
glowing but as you can see I definitely

446
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,580
had a lot my brush I was able to blend

447
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,020
it out too which is great because some

448
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,950
people obviously are not gonna want this

449
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,140
full-on glittery

450
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:08,210
glam highlight but y'all know me I need

451
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:10,250
to be x-ray app so I'm gonna dip back in

452
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:14,390
it once again and layer more on top for

453
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:15,530
that gold glitter effect oh my god Wow

454
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,430
I'm gonna go ahead and apply it to my

455
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:19,550
normal areas as

456
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:20,899
well being the brow bones okay so I was

457
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:22,640
super super excited for this highlighter

458
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:24,470
but after putting it on let's be real

459
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,839
this is definitely not for my skin tone

460
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:28,640
it is way too dark and way too golden as

461
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:29,930
well which is great because that means

462
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,270
that this will fit all my dark sisters

463
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:33,709
out there so so beautifully so if you

464
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,270
guys get this and try on it definitely

465
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:37,070
send me all the tweets and pics so I can

466
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:39,200
be jealous of your envious golden glow

467
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:41,149
but this highlighter definitely not for

468
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,250
me I'm actually gonna go back into this

469
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:45,110
duo and into a fire crystal and try that

470
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,760
instead I'm just going with my morphe m

471
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:48,709
405 ushe and i'm gonna quickly go over

472
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,790
just the highlight area to try to blend

473
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:51,410
it out a little bit and make it look and

474
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:53,930
not as intense because this golden glow

475
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,520
is a little bit too golden okay so

476
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,410
instead I'm gonna grab a clean m5a1

477
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,970
brush and dip into a fire crystal from

478
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:01,279
that duo that I just showed you guys and

479
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:03,200
try this one instead oh yeah that's a

480
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,899
lot better side note to if you have

481
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:08,300
nails these are really really hard to

482
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:10,310
open oh my god I'm like scared that I'm

483
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,870
gonna snap one I'm gonna save my final

484
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,100
thoughts at the end but the last step is

485
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,720
obviously going to be at the lip fitted

486
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,760
doodahs and for today I'm gonna be using

487
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,070
the venti glow lip gloss which I've

488
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,870
heard is literally so so good so I'm

489
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,400
very very excited to put this on so with

490
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:24,680
this gloss you get point three ounces of

491
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,480
product in its $18 so definitely not a

492
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,190
bad deal so the shade of this lip gloss

493
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,260
is definite like a muted mauve shade

494
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,940
which I absolutely love and there are

495
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,560
little flecks of gold that are in here

496
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,839
too for that high shine look so I'm

497
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,310
super excited to put this on oh wow

498
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,500
okay so I don't know if this is reading

499
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:41,570
on camera but in person this lip is

500
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,120
literally so shiny that it almost looks

501
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:45,709
like a metallic lipstick but I really

502
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,420
don't hate it because I'm kind of living

503
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:48,920
for the gloss so I actually didn't layer

504
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,089
this gloss over anything because that's

505
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,770
how it was marketed in the fenty

506
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:52,970
campaign I'm pretty sure all the models

507
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:55,339
how there's over there natural lip

508
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:56,990
colors and for me the formula is really

509
00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:58,700
really nice but I'm really not loving

510
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:00,260
the color that it's giving my lips it

511
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,760
doesn't look bad but I just feel like it

512
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,200
doesn't really match with this I look so

513
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,550
maybe if I layered it over top of

514
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,800
something it would look better but as

515
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:09,620
for the actual lip lost formula and feel

516
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,000
I like it I'm gonna finish off by spritz

517
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,760
my face using my Urban Decay all nighter

518
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,410
setting spray just to lock everything in

519
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:20,870
place and that is the full face of

520
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,100
fenty products okay so let's go back and

521
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,930
recap for those you sisters who are

522
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,910
interested in buying the primer and

523
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:29,540
foundation one hundred and fifty percent

524
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:30,829
I love this my skin looks so good I

525
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,500
barely had a powder on my face and it

526
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:35,360
dried down so so nicely the shade match

527
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,430
is really really good I look golden and

528
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,529
bronzy and like my texture is not

529
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:41,389
showing my pores look good I love this

530
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:43,310
and this honestly and maybe replacing my

531
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:44,839
makeup forever and two-phase duo but

532
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,069
you'll have to stay tuned in find out

533
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:46,940
I'm gonna keep braiding this look

534
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:48,800
throughout the day so I will definitely

535
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,779
tweet and stop and keep you guys posted

536
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,089
as to how it wears but as of right now I

537
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:55,279
love this next product we uses the

538
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:57,440
universal invisible adding powder which

539
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,720
I actually use for setting powder I am

540
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,190
once again love this as well it was

541
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,959
super super lightweight and even though

542
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:04,939
it is a light color which definitely had

543
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,439
me a little spooked at first it does not

544
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:07,730
give any flash back which is so great

545
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:09,260
and definitely did a really good job of

546
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:11,569
mattifying my skin and keeping

547
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,860
everything in please that was rude like

548
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:14,270
I said at the foundation did write down

549
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,679
a pretty matte so I really do not need a

550
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:17,089
lot of this but this will definitely be

551
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,429
going in might touch-up bag for when I

552
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:26,720
go to events because I love this the

553
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:28,040
next product we used the next product we

554
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,570
tested out was one of the matchsticks

555
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,700
and this is one of the contour shades I

556
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:33,500
picked out suede and this for me it was

557
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,059
more of a fail so the next product we

558
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,830
used was the matchstick and I picked up

559
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:38,540
the shade its way to do my cream

560
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,710
contouring and definitely I was a little

561
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,330
bit biased considering I don't really

562
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:43,940
like cream products to begin with but

563
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:45,290
this was not for me at all I really did

564
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,750
not like the formula of these it's not

565
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:49,159
bad by any means but I just focus on how

566
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,750
to work really really hard to really

567
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:52,010
blend this out and even after blending

568
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,510
it I still felt like it was a little bit

569
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:55,940
patchy so I definitely would not be

570
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:57,409
recommending this match stick or the

571
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,510
sponge as well I forgot to mention this

572
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,890
but this is just overall a big no it

573
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:02,090
really did not do that good of a job of

574
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:04,070
blending out I feel like I had to work

575
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:06,290
really really hard at it and also this

576
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:07,909
soaks up way too much product too as you

577
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,230
guys saw had to use like 15 pumps of

578
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:10,909
foundation to get a full face which is

579
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:13,580
never ever the move and it's gonna run

580
00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:14,570
you out of that foundation so fast $34

581
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,190
is definitely a lot of money to be

582
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:17,299
sending on a foundation so I would avoid

583
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,980
getting this because you're gonna waste

584
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:20,179
it to spend the extra four dollars and

585
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,250
get the regular Beauty Blender and save

586
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:23,960
yourself a whole lot of time and product

587
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,940
so even though this matchstick was a

588
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,240
major fail for me this match tip in the

589
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,970
shade

590
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,830
Stardust was a major major win it is

591
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,030
once again a cream stick and it is

592
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,860
supposed to be a highlighter but instead

593
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:35,630
of using it on my face I did use it as

594
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:38,000
my eye shadow to be my center highly of

595
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:39,890
my halo eye and oh my god like I said

596
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,570
before I love how this looks and it's

597
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,720
super super pigmented as you can see and

598
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,340
similar

599
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,350
the contour it was kind of hard to blend

600
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,880
out but for an eyeshadow look that's

601
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,290
really really great because as you can

602
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,060
see it's really not transferring it's

603
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:52,260
saying exactly where I put it and just

604
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,100
the edges were able to people ended up

605
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,050
with that perfect

606
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,490
glowy halo eye I definitely would

607
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,660
recommend this one so the next part if

608
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,340
we try it out were at the Frenchy Beauty

609
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,050
highlighters and these were a major fail

610
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,160
once again I'm so sad because I was

611
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,930
really really looking forward to these

612
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,220
especially the shade at trophy wife

613
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:07,320
all the models wearing it last night

614
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,850
looked so stunning with their gold

615
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,710
glittery highlights but it was

616
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:12,510
definitely way too dark for me honestly

617
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:14,160
it really not mad at it at all it's

618
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,450
about damn time a brand comes out with a

619
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,460
lot of products meant for a darker skin

620
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:19,410
tone so definitely if you are later skin

621
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,880
tone would not recommend but if you're a

622
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:22,380
dark Beauty these highlighters would be

623
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,640
it's so good for you

624
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,200
that's what the other highlighter duo

625
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,790
this one was a major fail for me as well

626
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,230
as you saw the shade lightning dust

627
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,910
really doesn't have any pigment at all

628
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,440
and then the shade of fire crystal was

629
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:33,270
super super beautiful but as you can see

630
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,340
it's on my face and it is looking a

631
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:36,390
little bit grayish white um I was

632
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,070
expecting this to be a little bit more

633
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:40,530
champagne E but it's definitely looking

634
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:41,550
a little bit too pale so for me I would

635
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:43,080
have loved to have a highlighter in the

636
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,970
middle of these two because this is too

637
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,950
dark and this is way too light slash

638
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:48,390
gray so hopefully Rihanna will come up

639
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,550
with a lot more things but for me the

640
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:51,930
highlighters where I fail and last but

641
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:54,780
certainly not least we try to feed vent

642
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:55,920
a beauty gloss and I love this like I

643
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,270
was saying I wish I layered this over

644
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,500
top of a liquid lipstick or regular

645
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,850
lipstick because I'm not loving the

646
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,200
color that it gave me to match with this

647
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,850
look muttering a side though because

648
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,740
that's my fault the formula itself I

649
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:06,030
absolutely love it feels very very

650
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,590
comfortable and lightweight on my lips

651
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,780
and not sticky which is literally the

652
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:11,190
best thing in the entire world and yeah

653
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,600
I really really like this and this will

654
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:14,520
definitely going in my bag as well

655
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,350
alright sister so that has the full

656
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,090
Fanta beauty products I'll try to and

657
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,440
reviewed definitely become a down below

658
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,850
and tell me which product you like best

659
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,860
and what you're dying to try it as well

660
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:24,120
overall after trying all these products

661
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,740
I think there are only two things in

662
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,210
total that I really didn't love and they

663
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,860
were still not bad at all just

664
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:30,840
definitely not for my makeup preference

665
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,580
so love that I also love the fact that

666
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,410
there are 40 foundation shades oh my god

667
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,490

669
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:38,490
starting to target towards with darker

670
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:40,170
