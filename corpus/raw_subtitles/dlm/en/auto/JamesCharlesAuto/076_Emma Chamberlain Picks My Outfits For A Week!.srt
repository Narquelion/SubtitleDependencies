30
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,000
lived a whole different life yeah and

31
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,320
then we come back and then we get to

32
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,920

33
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,440
talk about it all i know it's actually

34
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,719
so crazy to think about i mean i've

35
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,160
obviously written all friendship in

36
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,600
private and now that we've had a lot of

37
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,199
time to just hang out and catch up we

38
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,640
figured okay we started online

39
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,400
might as well bring it back to online

40
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,760
and give y'all a collaboration that

41
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,960
you've been asking for for a very long

42
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,439
time we're trying to think what would

43
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,119
really

44
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,240
make sense right and you guys know i've

45
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,000
been trying really hard to step up my

46
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,080
fashion game looks like my instagram has

47
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,320
definitely improved since you knew me

48
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,720
last for sure sure no more adidas track

49
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,920
pants and sisters merch every single day

50
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,280
although you are hey and i figured if

51
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,479
there's anybody that i think really has

52
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,159
their fashion game together

53
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,000
it is miss emma chamberlain do you know

54
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,400
how much of a compliment that is to me

55
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,640
because

56
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,000
i always felt like you were 10 steps

57
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,880
ahead in that area and the fact that

58
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
you're in fashion

59
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,840
you just have your together and so the

60
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,280
fact that you're coming to me for

61
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,360
anything like i feel

62
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,880

64
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,479

65
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,240

video

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,320
okay you have to picture it on this is

143
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,600
the thing about mine it's all about the

144
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,960
way you wear it

145
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,639
i can guarantee that you like this one

146
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,919
without going to a really important

147
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,560
business dinner and being like

148
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:56,880

days and two kind of

152
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,840
bad days but i think that you might be

153
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,039
impressed once you put the outfit on and

154
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,240
you kind of put it on your body and you

155
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,600
like look in the mirror and you do a

156
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,680
little bit of this there's also one more

157
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,479
day of the week you guys can say we only

158
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,240

until friday

162
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,759

163
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,039
suspicious faces

164
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,880

166
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,440
i anticipated and i think i can make all

167
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,280
of these work

168
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,560

187
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,759
confusing

188
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,000
i think we did everything enough like

189
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,319
this again without an old man's shoe

190
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,039
right or an ammo shoe i just think the

191
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,360
green

192
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,080
and that shoe just gives me very like

193
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,000
clouds

194
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,520
listen this is my fault i do love the

195
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,880
set on you and i just think that the

196
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,639
dogs would be better

197
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,280
give it a try okay wait oh this is so

198
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,919
much better

199
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,039
oh that is better that is so much cooler

200
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,440
that is definitely better

201
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,160
it was just the shoes okay it was just

202
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,000
the shoes

203
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,120

204
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,400

checkered look as i've had it on for

221
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,720
longer it is growing on me a little bit

222
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,080
it's definitely like not something that

223
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,280
i would normally put myself in but i

224
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,400
feel like the whole point of this video

225
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,840
in the first place was to get me out of

226
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,039
my comfort zone and put me in a fun and

227
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,479
fresh outfit and i feel like she

228
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,680
definitely succeeded sorry i'm moving

229
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,520
the camera a little everywhere this is

230
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,160
why i'm not good at vlogging anyway

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,599

we had the green checkered outfit on

297
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,839
i figured today i would do my second

298
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,360
least favorite of the outfits which is

299
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,480
the pink and red stripes just to get it

300
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,600
over with we don't have too much weight

301
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,120
on today i was actually supposed to be

302
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,160
on set for a very exciting project today

303
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,240
which would have been fun

304
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,160
but it got cancelled which is sad but

305
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,720
now less people have to see me in the

306
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,959
look

307
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,640
that's kind of mean that is me emma did

308
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,160
a beautiful job it's just not exactly my

309
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,560
style we're gonna try it on anyway so

310
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,200
let's

311
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,200
get started

312
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:48,640
whoa oh she didn't take it out that

313
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,560
juicy dump truck oh no

314
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,279
oh yeah oh my god these are the tightest

315
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,600
ones i've ever put on

316
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,720
pushed it out look at my body it's all

317
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,720
about the angle ladies

318
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,920
but this um we can definitely return if

319
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,680
we keep the tag on it was

320
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,800
kind of expensive i felt bad buying it

321
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:08,000
how much was

322
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,839
how much was that with tax well a little

323
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,839
under 400.

324
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,200
we can keep the tag on that's why i'm

325
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,839
great oh my god this

326
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,839
is so emma emma would look so good in

327
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,839
this

328
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,600
the pants are just not fitting very well

329
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,120
and that's not emma's fault

330
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,120
my own fault for just having a juicy

331
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,839
okay let's go take a photo shoot sure

332
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,160
so we decided to all take a family trip

333
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,200
down to melrose and since

334
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,560
you know obviously i'm in this pink and

335
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,399
white outfit today and i am feeling like

336
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,680
a very basic la white girl so i figured

337
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,360
why not just take it a step further and

338
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,920
match my pink outfit

339
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,990

359
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,839
special video that i have to film

360
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,279
and then also a business dinner tonight

361
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,839
and i think for today's look i want to

362
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,839
go with

363
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,279
the white racing one that literally

364
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,800
everyone loved including

365
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,480
me because i'm filming it's important to

366
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,040
me that the outfit i'm in is like true

367
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,959
to my

368
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,000
normal brand i guess and then for dinner

369
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,200

370
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,200

this is the full look all completely

373
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,079
honestly obsessed i think this looks so

374
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,680
so

375
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:56,079
cute this look is it however the fit

376
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,279
is it's oh there you go i'm

377
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,200
not sure what size

378
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,880
pants miss emma thought that i was

379
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,880
they're good around the waist but like

380
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,399
it's producing a little bit of the

381
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,440
muffin top which is you know it's fine

382
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,760
everybody has one

383
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,200
like really have to accentuate some

384
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,480
angles here the jacket however i'm

385
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,120
literally obsessed with this outfit i

386
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,720
think looks

387
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,320
so good and i can see myself reusing

388
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,160
this in future looks as well so

389
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,600
i'm ready for the day and hopefully i

390
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,600
get caught because i'm ready for

391
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:27,360
oh wow oh my god

392
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,200
hello hi you guys i know you have not

393
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,279
seen me since this morning

394
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,959
um if i'm going to be honest with you i

395
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,279
have not filmed anything

396
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,200
for the video today in my outfit

397
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,240
although it was super super cute

398
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,399
because i'm going to be real um today

399
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,000
sucked i don't know how else to put it

400
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,320
or like what else to say or i don't want

401
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,839
to show

402
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,519
you anything of course that happens to

403
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,480
everybody but i'm just like

404
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,600
so sad and confused had our filming this

405
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,519
morning and it was

406
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,880
terrible um the video was definitely

407
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,240
going to be scrapped which is

408
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,000
very disappointing and weird because

409
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,279
that doesn't happen very often so i've

410
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,800
been in my head about that

411
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,560
all day long and then i had a business

412
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,480
dinner tonight which did go well

413
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,000
but as soon as we got to the restaurant

414
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,519
and walked in with my cute outfit which

415
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,279
i was excited to show you guys

416
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,320
they literally took our phones and were

417
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,120
like hey we're gonna need to put a

418
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,639
sticker

419
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,560
on your phone cameras because we have a

420
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,000
no photo policy which is fine obviously

421
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,800
i can definitely enjoy dinner without

422
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,200
having my phone

423
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,639
but therefore this video with miss emma

424
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,720
which i've been very excited about

425
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,160
i did not get any really great footage

426
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,000
today it's okay

427
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,680
obviously you know not every day can be

428
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,480
an amazing one i'm gonna

429
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,399
get my outfit off unfortunately as cute

430
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,760
as it is and get into bed and

431
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,700
hopefully wake up tomorrow to a way

432
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,880

it's my favorite

487
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,279
person what's going on with all these

488
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,320
people trying to come out with makeup

489
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,760
lines i don't know i mean

490
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,800
makeup is such an amazing industry

491
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,920
obviously and there's a lot of people

492
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,519
that are involved with it and a lot of

493
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,320
times too there's quite a lot of money

494
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,440
as well so

495
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,959
i think that there's a lot of people

496
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,000
involved that you know really want to

497
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,279
come out with a cool line

498
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,399
and sometimes people get involved for

499
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,160
the wrong reasons as well but it's

500
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,680
really not my position to ever say

501
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,360
it almost seems like they should contact

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,320

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,520

video that i supposed to film which i

669
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,799
told you about which will not be

670
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,480
mentioned in this video but it

671
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,919
went so and i just ended up having a

672
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,400
really really bad day

673
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,919
which sucked because i planned to put

674
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,200
myself in my favorite outfit of the day

675
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,080
which was the white outfit with the

676
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,679

cute

683
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,200
honestly if you're gonna have a

684
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,640
breakdown you have to be wearing a

685
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,919
firefight for it like that's where i'm

686
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,799

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,919
of ten for me

688
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,600
