110
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,140

111
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:44,260

00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:46,390
where I don't close right where I'm not

00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,550

119
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,750

00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:12,280
yeah but you guys don't don't we trying

123
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:14,020
to get along we're best friends now you

124
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,370
can no you relax

125
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,530
so I've been just having you guys for

126
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,340
literally over a year now and I it's

127
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,890
gonna be really embarrassing

128
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,320
I just realized probably about roughly

129
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:25,090
two weeks ago that a family was like

130
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,540
Boston Kathryn my mouth oh my gosh

131
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,850
really

132
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,470
so what do you think Iowa I generally

133
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,760
don't know no I didn't think that you

134
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,380
thought that we just picked that like

135
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,950
who's and then it all hit me nothing oh

136
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,690
wow

137
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:37,600
will you be changing the name no the

138
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:41,979
sister-like is here no so that was like

139
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,590
a question but acfm oh no no no

140
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:46,110
so we were thinking of names

141
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,790
with either a C or an 8 because we

142
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,190
didn't want to change the name yeah if

143
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:52,560
we round exactly campus our names are

144
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:54,300
used a three way yeah so we thought of a

145
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,740
so the aim just goes in with my a and

146
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,800
yeah is the same okay what if we have a

147
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:01,320
boy hmm it could potentially change like

148
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:06,240
really change this time that's all I can

149
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:07,710
really say because we already had the

150
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,120
names picked out before Ace was even

151
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,430
nothing we love a branded family

152
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,540
honestly you know I think I would read

153
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,370
in family because I just think this is

154
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,080
so cool awesome even they're talking to

155
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,330

156
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,650

and fun and fresh Thanks same for me I

163
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,840
just joined two years ago when I'm about

164
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:38,370
to have ten kind of I'm not for us

165
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:42,570
so fun how was your guys's life's

166
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:43,650
changed drastically and a lot of good

167
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,510
ways and a lot of

168
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,830
not-so-good ways but it's changed for

169
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:49,830
the better I definitely think that

170
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:51,870
really we enjoy what we do so it's just

171
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:53,669
a blessing to be able to wake up and do

172
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,789
what you love every single day but

173
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:58,440
sometimes it does get a little bit

174
00:06:55,789 --> 00:06:59,700
overwhelming just little incidents here

175
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,370
and there that happen and you're just

176
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:04,590
like well this is my life now my life

177
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:06,990
has changed mainly because we show so

178
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,729
much I think right just like our daily

179
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:11,130
lives like we show like our daughter

180
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:12,539
people see us like that day and they're

181
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,520
like oh I know what you wore yesterday

182
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:16,740
saw you yesterday so they really feel

183
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,870
like they know you which is amazing but

184
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,419
sometimes it can get a little scary

185
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:23,250
giving it giving you a little plump so

186
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:25,169
don't don't mind it I'm gonna jump in

187
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,700
adjust it I love with the pump it's okay

188
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:28,590
so yes I'm thinking it a little scary

189
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,870
because you're showing things that maybe

190
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:32,400
you shouldn't be showing so that's one

191
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,900
thing that we've had to learn along the

192
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,340
way I think everyone on social media has

193
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,720
to learn that at some point like when I

194
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,639
first started out I was posting

195
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,169
everything and I also got them all a lot

196
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,389
of drama

197
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:42,740
and my like community as well and would

198
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:44,389
always tweet about it and I was like oh

199
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,189
I need to stop doing that probably

200
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:47,990
immediately right now since I've kind of

201
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:49,159
matured and grown up in space and just

202
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,710
gotten older and really figured out like

203
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:52,729
what I can and can't be posting because

204
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,289
obviously there's a lot of people

205
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:55,879
watching my life is not like way better

206
00:07:54,289 --> 00:08:04,909
after figuring that out yeah it's

207
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:07,969
definitely learning as you go you better

208
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:11,719
give me those angles in order to be

209
00:08:07,969 --> 00:08:13,279
successful I love giving you a goes in

210
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:15,800

things there you never be used to but

300
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:40,510

302
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:44,800

with whatever you you know you're the

305
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,630
artist tonight the whole motto of my

306
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:51,640
campaign is to unleash your inner artist

307
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:56,320
and I think that's what it's going on

308
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:57,250
here it's very pigmented belly is mm-hmm

309
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,750
have either one of you ever done

310
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:03,280
somebody else's makeup before no what it

311
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,410
all will start experimenting with makeup

312
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:08,290
will you let her and at what age do you

313
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:10,630
think she's gonna be 30 I'll definitely

314
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:12,400
let her for sure she watches me do my

315
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:14,230
makeup every day as far as like her

316
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:17,830
wearing makeup I don't think I'll let

317
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:20,950
her until she's learning dirt I started

318
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:22,780
wearing makeup at like 14 and it wasn't

319
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:24,640
like obviously wasn't heavy but I wear

320
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:26,650
like some eyeliner some lipstick

321
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,720
brighter like lip gloss I don't want to

322
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:30,040
be that contradicting like tell her she

323
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,870
can't wear makeup and Here I am I

324
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,850
wearing right well awesome there's a

325
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,440
reason why you say older because she

326
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,630
won't be dating until she's probably 30

327
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,430
so I think everything will happen when

328
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,720
she's 30 okay my parents now are like my

329
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,920
biggest fans in the entire world but

330
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,450
well I first sorry to cut you off I

331
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,650
don't like that the sisters can't really

332
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:47,140
see what I'm working with

333
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:49,690
I'd like to just show first we get okay

334
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,070
cuz when you look straight you can't

335
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,530
really give him the full sauce whatever

336
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:55,270
Saturn what is this it's just it's calm

337
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:56,530
I said he's gonna feel comfortable bit

338
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,010
when I'm done okay it's not fully

339
00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:00,850
finished

340
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:02,020
yeah I know when I first are doing we

341
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,850
can my parents were definitely like

342
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,230
concerned they want me to wear either

343
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,940
just because they thought that I was

344
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:09,130
using it that's like a way to like

345
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:11,290
validate myself or feel good but I kind

346
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:17,350
of explained like it is hard to express

347
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:19,000
yourself next off you're messing up my

348
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:25,600

372
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:24,880

373
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:27,460

little baby kids channels yeah I do my

376
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,400
research I studied I'm not really a fan

377
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:38,620
of nobody or watch like someone specific

378
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:41,470
or just watch people over and over I

379
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,550
just study the entire market so it's

380
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,870
important to be knowledgeable of the

381
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:45,460
space that you're working at exactly

382
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,839
yeah I watch a lot of people too

383
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,670
so when people say like oh do you know

384
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:51,400
about this person yes I know about them

385
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:52,600
because I study what they do right and I

386
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,490
feel like everyone should because you

387
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,480
should be up-to-date with what's going

388
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,480
almost a new trend

389
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:05,490

505
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:36,440

518
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:34,669
continuous saying this this is to give

519
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:37,210

544
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,260
that you went with right here

545
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,650
I remember remember remember what I said

546
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:05,890
this look is very like you want that

547
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:08,860
person to feel oh you don't want like

548
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:09,400
that sighs more like soft like oh come

549
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,470
to me

550
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,540
Catherine loving the foundation on your

551
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:17,530
side looks beautiful the laughs the plan

552
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:19,180
oh you apply the logic down right on

553
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:22,000
there from my angle is a little tilted

554
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:23,860
so it's definitely not in the middle of

555
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,080
your eyeball so I don't know where

556
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,580
you're getting real brave critiquing her

557
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,490
over there if he ever needs his

558
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:32,560
eyelashes supplies okay I'll call you

559
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:35,110
from looking beautiful I'm kind of

560
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,870
looking beautiful looking nice

561
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:39,250
yeah cousin you did a really good job

562
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:41,320
thank you love this foundation looks

563
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:43,000
pretty good okay love this eyeshadow

564
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,010
color choice I'm assuming you I would

565
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,600
probably you're kidding and then some

566
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:48,340
good 5:08 your favorite orange shade

567
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:55,210
yeah that's the Lambo correct that you

568
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:56,680
almost killed us and earlier my favorite

569
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,520
part is the eyelash that was glued to

570
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,280
the middle of my eyelid

571
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,160
I really love the lip application okay

572
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:06,070
so back to what we're talking about yeah

573
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:10,060
you want to be aggressive with it so the

574
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:12,400
approach is really like just ready like

575
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:14,080
ready for a boy to come over yes that's

576
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,700
night is very so besides like he walks

577
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,560
in these and you guys both look each

578
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:21,180
