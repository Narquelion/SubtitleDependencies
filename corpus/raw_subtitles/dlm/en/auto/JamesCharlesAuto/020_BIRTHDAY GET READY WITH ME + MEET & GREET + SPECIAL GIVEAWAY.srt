know sister James loves her morphe I

58
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,710
feel like I've already been at 17

59
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,370
forever this year where it's so slow but

60
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,140
there were like so many amazing

61
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:01,660
helping and so many not so amazing

62
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,830
things too but I'm so thankful for you

63
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,380
guys that I've like stuck with me

64
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:06,880
through the entire thing I'm a human

65
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,170
being I'm growing I'm learning I

66
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,910
definitely got into the industry it's

67
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:12,190
super super quickly and I really really

68
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:14,220
young it was just amazing I'm so

69
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:16,690
thankful for everything that I

70
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,840
accomplished and achieved and all of you

71
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:21,220
guys but at the same time it definitely

72
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,630
pushed me to learn it and educate myself

73
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,130
very very quickly I definitely made a

74
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:26,230
lot of mistakes and I said a lot of

75
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,820
things that I shouldn't have but I think

76
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,350
that it's important to know that as

77
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,850
human beings we all make mistakes and

78
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:33,460
that the only thing you can do

79
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,810
appreciate you know take them back it's

80
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,870
just grow and better yourself as a

81
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:39,640
person I'm so excited for what this year

82
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,680
has to hold I can promise you guys there

83
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,660
are a lot of really really cool things

84
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,950
that are happening right now on behind

85
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,620
the scenes that I can't talk to you

86
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:50,230
about just yet but definitely keep your

87
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,950
eyes peeled because I'm working here on

88
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,960
the lot

89
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,760
I'm just genuinely so committed to work

90
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,550
I feel as I was already super super

91
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,320
motivated beforehand but moving to LA

92
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:01,120
everybody here has like a major agenda

93
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,070
everybody here has something to do and

94
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,320
living here just really pushes me to

95
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,030
work so hard and be the best version of

96
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,310
myself and just get a whole lot of

97
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,400
I feel like I'm a boss ass [ __ ] when

98
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,930
I'm here and I absolutely love it oh my

99
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,230
god I just I'm so excited for you guys

100
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:19,270
to see it work like what's coming I

101
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,650
honestly have no idea what makeup I'm

102
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,989
doing today I'm just starting with my

103
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:24,700
face I'm gonna figure it out I feel like

104
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:26,470
when I'm taking a lot of pictures I need

105
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,670
to do really really light makeup but at

106
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:33,580
the same time we're gonna kind of let me

107
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:35,740
go but I'm definitely not having a good

108
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,690
skin day today which is annoying

109
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,550
days today would be the one to hop if

110
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,880
it's goodbye hey but of course that's

111
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:44,230
how my luck work I was up so they last

112
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,780
said with all the sisters they all came

113
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,070
over and surprised me have been they

114
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,410
literally is so cute and like a friend

115
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:53,380
at kamut I sent me a pizza so we all

116
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:55,540
shouted down the coolest runs in the

117
00:03:53,380 --> 00:04:01,540
entire Bell that I'm so so happy right

118
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:03,790
now I remember as a child always wanting

119
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,920
to be the 18 so badly and now that I'm

120
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,540
actually here everything is like exactly

121
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,310
the same I mean it's gonna help every

122
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,330
birthday room obviously but I just

123
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,090
remember being like oh my god I want to

124
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:14,740
be 18 so that's I could be illegal if

125
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,720
don't do all these fun things but like

126
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,440
now actually being here like I don't do

127
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,660
anything anyway

128
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,190
it's so crazy because I've been living

129
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,230
alone for a few months now and I started

130
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,670
that they were when I was 17 I graduated

131
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,380
early and moved across the country which

132
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:29,140
is something that a lot of people can't

133
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:31,120
even say when they're 18 or 19 so I'm so

134
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,730
like I think I've always been very like

135
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,070
ahead of my age and older inside that I

136
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:38,740
was on my birth certificate I guess

137
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,850
that's not so stupid but I really is the

138
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,160
truth the only thing I don't think a lot

139
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,080
of older people I don't think I'm a lot

140
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,340
more mature than a lot of kids that are

141
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,480
my age and I really get really really

142
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,670
cool to me right now

143
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,560
I guess the only real exciting part

144
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:52,750
about today is now I cannot legally have

145
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,110
a grinder how about let's be real a lot

146
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,980
better do anything anyway so for my

147
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,330
brows that I'm going to use the ax

148
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,520
benefit persistent brow pencil on the

149
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:04,320
shaded number 4 I'm going to lightly

150
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,320
fill them in and sculpt them

151
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,970
I'm honestly so excited for the next

152
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,770
upcoming weeks I go home back to New

153
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:18,100
York with all the sisters for my senior

154
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:19,510
graduation and I am so beyond excited I

155
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,950
opened up a package for my parents

156
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,450
yesterday before my birthday and they

157
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,880
may be like it's too little bunch

158
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:26,410
of like old cute baby photos in the end

159
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,960
photos from like my friends and stuff

160
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:31,870
and I just started bawling I don't cry

161
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,100
like ever but oh opening that pocket

162
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,570
just really put it in perspective how

163
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,400
much I miss them so much

164
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:38,800
I've been wanting to like move out and

165
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,540
just kind of be independent for as long

166
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,190
as I could remember there's three years

167
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,450
old I was in my own apartment

168
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,400
and like if you asked my mom she will

169
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:47,290
tell you this - hi boys then super super

170
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,000
independent but now that I actually live

171
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:50,889
alone I can't even explain how much I

172
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,500
miss my mom and things she would do for

173
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:54,970
me I really do miss her

174
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,229
last two times I've only make up for

175
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,490
some reason my brows keep coming out

176
00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:59,139
really really uneven and it's really

177
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:01,210
starting to get on my last nerve

178
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:04,360
I don't know what it's going on but one

179
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:06,030
side of the tail looks a lot like better

180
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:10,120
than the other one I guess and it's

181
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:12,850
father like I think I was so good to go
