00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,210
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,830
welcome back to toy-u channel

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,660
usually for my videos I felt my intro

4
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,400
first and then film the actual video

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,840
content but for today's video

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,660
I'm doing something a little bit

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,400
different my editor I just finished the

8
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,440
final edit version of today's video that

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,880
you guys are about to watch and I really

10
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,529
just wanted to cut out the intro that we

11
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,359
already felt and hop on camera now

12
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:22,980
instead and give you guys a little

13
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,689
preface to today's video and say that

14
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,310
this is literally one of my favorite

15
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:27,420
videos that I have ever filmed I am so

16
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,160
proud of how this turned out what I know

17
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,689
that you guys are absolutely going to

18
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,510
love it I have been trying to film a

19
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,880
video like this for over two years now

20
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,190
and it's never been possible up until

21
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,600
today now if you are a true sister you'd

22
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,309
know that aside from doing makeup of

23
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,290
course my favorite pastime in the entire

24
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:44,340
world is doing escape rooms in case

25
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,690
you've never done it at Skate even

26
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,820
before or don't even know what it is

27
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,010
first of all I'm so sorry for you but

28
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,329
second of all escape rooms are immersive

29
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,190
interactive puzzle rooms where you're

30
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,960
basically locked into space for 60

31
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,910
minutes with your family co-workers

32
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,350
friends or sometimes even strangers and

33
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,320
you have to work together to solve

34
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,049
puzzles riddles find clues open locks

35
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,519
and the goal is of course to escape now

36
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,810
I personally love escape rooms for a few

37
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,670
different reasons mostly because I

38
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,439
really really thrive and enjoy high

39
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,720
pressure and high-stress situations I

40
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,280
absolutely love puzzle and riddle

41
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,600
solving and also you get to put your

42
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,740
phone away for an hour and just focus on

43
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,880
something other than like those social

44
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,770
media road which I definitely get caught

45
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,110
up in up quite a lot and they just make

46
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,580
me very very happy most rooms start with

47
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,860
60 minutes on the clock which may seem

48
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,350
like a really long time but when you're

49
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,180
in there time absolutely flies but as

50
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,490
I've done at more and more rooms my

51
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,799
times have gotten faster and faster and

52
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,880
faster and for today's video I want to

53
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,310
challenge myself and combine my two

54
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,680
biggest passions and I'm gonna see if I

55
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,180
can do my full face of makeup while

56
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:48,270
beating an escape room

57
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:50,860
[Music]

58
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,630
all right sisters we are here at a 60

59
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,950
out escape rooms in Los Angeles and this

60
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,420
is literally my favorite place to go for

61
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,740
escape rooms because they have so many

62
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,470
different locations and I've actually

63
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:01,900
almost finished every single one of the

64
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,130
rooms so I'm so grateful and excited

65
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,320
that we got to put this video together

66
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,729
in time before I finished literally all

67
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,170
of them I have not seen the room yet

68
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:09,220
because I want this to be a surprise I

69
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,380
wanna be able to solve it just like

70
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,180
normal but my videographer Luis who's

71
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,709
behind the camera right now already went

72
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,390
through the room up with the 60 out team

73
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:18,459
and placed my makeup products like in

74
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,930
the right order so as I go through and I

75
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:21,940
complete the room I'll be getting my

76
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,980
products like one by one so do my full

77
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,330
face of makeup and a full escape room in

78
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,340
under an hour not really sure how this

79
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,200
is gonna go but regardless it's going to

80
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,940
be so much fun and I'm so excited to

81
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,310
