good year and 2020 is about to be upon

us when the end of the year comes around

10
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,090
those always all sorts of lists that pop

11
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,949
up documenting big things that happened

12
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,090

Billboard top songs of the year we also

15
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,130
of course have our favorite YouTube

16
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,250
rewind which is always an interesting

17
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,710
look back on here and as well Google

18
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,700
also does a year in searches now we all

19
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,559
know that Google is the biggest search

20
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,180
engine in the entire world and we all

21
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,649
use it on a daily basis and you can

22
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,989
pretty much find like literally

23
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,190
everything ever on Google so the Year

24
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:45,870
interviewer always a really interesting

25
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,520
way to kind of look back at trends and

26
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,719
really see what people are searching for

27
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,160
and this year when I was looking through

28
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,590
the trends I came across a very

29
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,960
interesting discovery and that was the

30
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,879
list of the most searched people in the

31
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,579
entire world number one that was Antonio

32
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,859
Brown number two was Neymar and number

33
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,329
three was James Charles so not

34
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:10,290
surprising that the list was topped by

35
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:12,630
three perfect so no no but in all

36
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,729
seriousness somehow yours truly James

37
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:18,090
Charles was the number three most

38
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:19,560
searched person worldwide in 2019 now at

39
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,210
first when I saw this it was a very

40
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,130
alarming and very shocking until I

41
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,350
looked at the actual graph of the trend

42
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,850
and suddenly it wasn't so shocking

43
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,040
anymore if you don't know what this

44
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,049
means don't worry about it if there's

45
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,970
that many people actually searching my

46
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,590
name which it's very scary I figured

47
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,990
there must be a lot of questions as well

48
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,340
so for today's video inspired by a wire

49
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,259
I thought it'd be really fun to answer

50
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,650
the web's most searched questions about

51
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,889
me let's go

52
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,889
[Music]

53
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:51,439
all right you guys we're just gonna jump

54
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,259
right into these questions today I

55
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,880
honestly have no idea what they are Luis

56
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:57,350
would not let me see them hopefully some

57
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,360
of them will be juicy but nothing it's

58
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:01,610
how bad Luis did go ahead and prepare

59
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,319
these lovely ripoff tear sheets just

60
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:05,390
like they have in the actual videos so

61
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:08,030
let's just go ahead this first prompt

62
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:10,459
says why is James Charles and if we

63
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:15,349
uncover the first one says why is James

64
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:17,330
Charles famous I really don't know this

65
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:21,620
is your fault you all did this not me

66
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:22,610
why is James Charles so popular well you

67
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,470
know like I was think in the intro

68
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,810
famous awfully hello the amount of

69
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,860
touchdowns and homeruns that I got for

70
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,049
the Lakers this year was like

71
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,610
groundbreaking so that's probably why

72
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:34,430
people tend to love me a lot why is

73
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,650
James Charles playing Minecraft

74
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,660
oh okay to be honest I love that this is

75
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,910
actually a search term kind of fun when

76
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,590
I was a younger kid probably 12 13 14

77
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,940
years old minecraft was my absolute

78
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,769
favorite game out of come home school

79
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,630
and play every single day and this past

80
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:48,980
year minecraft had a major revival in

81
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,780
the YouTube space that thanks to are a

82
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,769
king of PewDiePie and I'd have to play

83
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,000
in a tournament called at minecraft

84
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:53,989
Monday where we all competing with a

85
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,209
bunch of other youtubers and it was

86
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:57,500
really fun I never won because I was too

87
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,970
busy being a famous athlete and not a

88
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,480
famous game work it was a really really

89
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:06,859
good time why is James Charles pallet

90
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:10,519
not on Murphy that is a great question

91
00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:12,769
it should be on Murphy calm and all

92
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:14,180
Murphy stores in retail locations on

93
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:16,639
both of us you can use Co teams return

94
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,549
for some alpha or a scandal happened

95
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:23,329
that I am not aware of so why is James

96
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:24,739
pallet so popular once again a lot of

97
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:27,079
the other athletes on the team really

98
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:29,400
love spooky the black shade for like

99
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:32,890
they're under

100
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,880
what does my father there there there

101
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:36,100
son

102
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,840
walk nope sorry I mean there I black

103
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:41,050
yeah we were on the field last game and

104
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,500
I think like Tom Brady LeBron James also

105
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:46,420
Babe Ruth oh all had me apply there i

106
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,380
black so I just like dipped into the

107
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,090
palette and gave it a little bit of

108
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,709
swatch and they were good for the entire

109
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,630
game so that's why

110
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:57,630
all right this prompt starts with is

111
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:59,830
James Charles is it James Charles

112
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:03,310
Mexican is not really the most searched

113
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:05,500
thing with that no I am NOT Mexican I

114
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:10,060
think that my parents are polish and

115
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:11,800
Irish which is Caucasian as hell but my

116
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,510
best friend's family is a full Mexican

117
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,370
so Mexican culture has become a very big

118
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:17,079
part of my life and I love it so much

119
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,150
and this past year I actually did my

120
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,280
first ever video in Spanish which was

121
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:23,740

203
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,600
of the most fun collaborations that I've

204
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:05,230
ever done I got to be an Iggy azalea's

205
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,940
at music video for Sally Walker and the

206
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:09,040

207
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,300
for her up cover and we found that from

208
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,440
like YouTube channel which you can watch

209
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,060
right up here if you guys want to check

210
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,770
that out I definitely would love to do a

211
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,690
very similar type of collaboration with

212
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:18,700
other artists in the future so it hit me

213
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:21,250
up if you need a music video appearance

214
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:24,970
and a really acute problem cover makeup

215
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:27,100
look was James Charles on the masked

216
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,480
singer no I was not on the masked singer

217
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,520
although I am obsessed of the shower

218
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,080
head like my voice is so annoyingly

219
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,170
distinguishable that the gig would be up

220
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,310
in like three seconds far so probably

221
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:38,050
not happening anytime soon

222
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:40,270
Dennis it the gig would be up the jig

223
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,470
would be up does it matter

224
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,880
people's ears will be bleeding and they

225
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:47,530
would know it's me it's what I'm trying

226
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,760
to say so was James Charles in taste in

227
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:57,040
taste

228
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:59,620
oh yes was James Charles mom and haha no

229
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,020
my mom Christy B was not in home alone

230
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,910
although I and she get questions about

231
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,900
it literally all the time the mom went

232
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,580
home alone was played by the actress

233
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,050
named Catherine O'Hara my mom's name is

234
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,360
Christy they're not the same person

235
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:15,630
although I will say they do look very

236
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:19,120
very similar what is it James Charles

237
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:22,630
networth oh that is for me to know and

238
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,970
you to not ever find out what is James

239
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:26,470
Charles dog's name his name is Finnegan

240
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,300
his insecurity has been Charles and he's

241
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:35,860
literally an angel sent from above oh

242
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:37,570
and he is also right no animal testing

243
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:41,070

school with a 4.0 GPA and Ohio DARS may

273
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:09,160
I add and for me I was on a career path

274
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:11,649
that was taking off and I really wanted

275
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:14,889
to focus on so I moved to LA and started

276
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:19,660
working full-time did James Charles get

277
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:21,999
a dog yes did James Charles invent the

278
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,319
pink train technically no because a few

279
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:25,149
years ago it was still one of those like

280
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:27,189
secret menu items and you how to order

281
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:29,350
the a strawberry acai refresher with

282
00:11:27,189 --> 00:11:30,730
coconut milk and water only the true oh

283
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,679
gee sisters will remember having to

284
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,359
order all about it in order to get the

285
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:35,649
actual drain but when I first moved to

286
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:37,539
LA I was walking to Starbucks and

287
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:38,769
ordering that drink every single morning

288
00:11:37,539 --> 00:11:40,269
and I would I just post about it on my

289
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:41,409
snapchat story and say I got the pink

290
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:41,589
ring which then turned into the pink

291
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,970
kitty

292
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:44,529
djenka D which is not the pink shade in

293
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:46,059
my palette and from talking about it all

294
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:47,919
the time people started ordering it and

295
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:49,720
eventually Starbucks actually added it

296
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:51,309
to the permanent menu and they did tell

297
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,589
me that that was because I mean and you

298
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:56,309
guys ordering it so kind of cool why

299
00:11:53,589 --> 00:12:00,970
does James Charles

300
00:11:56,309 --> 00:12:03,189
sing I sing because singing it makes me

301
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,089
very very happy I love music so much I

302
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,470
will tell you that

303
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:06,999
sometimes I listen back to videos of me

304
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:11,019
singing and I asked myself the same

305
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:13,749
question so why does James Charles blink

306
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:15,040
so much that is also a great question I

307
00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:16,209
never even realized that I did this

308
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,220
until I started making YouTube videos

309
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:19,839
and I got thousands and thousands of hit

310
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,339
comments about it so thank you so much

311
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,809
for making me insecure about a normal

312
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:25,180
bodily function that literally every

313
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:26,529
single person does I really have no idea

314
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,059
you tried having awful I say it and not

315
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:29,529
be able to see anything and having to

316
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:30,910
our color contacts and eyelashes that

317
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:34,240
weigh a pound each and having powder

318
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:39,129
file why does James Charles wear a

319
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:41,350
safety pin to keep my ear safe and the

320
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:43,660
last question on the video why does

321
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,829
James Charles say a sister although this

322
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,540
is actually cute when to end things off

323
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:48,610
on I say sister because it is the name

00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,740
