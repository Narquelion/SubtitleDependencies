00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,930
guys's Instagram pages and I have

21
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:38,670
literally been so beyond shocked at how

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,960
much talent we have in this sisterhood

23
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,059

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,309
guys are literally some of the most

26
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,710
incredible makeup artists I have ever

27
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:47,730
seen it but for today's video I asked

28
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,140
some of you guys to tweet me your

29
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,239

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,610
done on yourself and I'm gonna do my

31
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,860
best and matching your crazy talent

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,149
levels and recreated them on my face I

33
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,559
think it'll be really fun to see how our

34
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,000
different styles compare and it also

35
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,050
will be quite a little bit of a

36
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,239
challenge because I will say that I

37
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,830
picked three pretty awesome looks for

38
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,270
this first video I definitely wanna do

39
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,530
more of these in the future so if you

40
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,060

41
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,130

but without further ado keep on watching

45
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:25,049
it you never know your luck may be in

46
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:26,640
this video let's get started the first

47
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,189
thing I want to try to recreate today is

48
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,020
this one which is sent in by Rocio seja

49
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,280
if you guys do not know who she is you

50
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,439
have to check her out an Instagram but

51
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,090
she does the most beautiful colourful

52
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:38,549
looks I've ever seen in her talent level

53
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,140
is literally unreal you have to go check

54
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,400
her out she was with me and the benefit

55
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,259
broad competition so she definitely has

56
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,420
a special place in my heart but let's be

57
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,950
real a girl can blend and this is

58
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,600
definitely gonna be a really really hard

59
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,450
challenge one she tweeted me this she

60
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,250
literally said good luck sister so

61
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,540
challenge accepted so after looking at

62
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,860
all of Rho cos work I noticed that the

63
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,259
one thing she hasn't common with all of

64
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,180
her looks like the little stamp of Rocio

65
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,829
approval is she has a little star here

66
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,780
on the inner corner and I know that she

67
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:05,100
does this using a sticker so I want you

68
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,530
to start today to look for star stickers

69
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,239
and these foam glitter stars with the

70
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,739
only thing I could find this is probably

71
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,350
gonna get really messy and really

72
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,250
annoying but

73
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:16,720
it's gonna go ahead and I'm gonna pop

74
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,720
one of these right on my inner corner

75
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:23,480
hello

76
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:25,310
let's try that again what that is

77
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,720
definitely a way to bigger stars and

78
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,230
sister Rose here we usually use this but

79
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,520
you know what

80
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,290
so the colors did her luck today are

81
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,640
obviously a rainbow so I figured the

82
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,550
best palate to use for this would be the

83
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,900
morphine 35b it has all colors of the

84
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,360
rainbow I love this palette and you can

85
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,950
use code James for 10% off I'm gonna

86
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,810
grab it M 4-3-3 brush and dip into this

87
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,250
bright yellow shade down in here I'm

88
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,020
gonna start by packing that into the

89
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,610
inner corner she also always brings her

90
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,050
shadow all the way up to her brow bone

91
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,790
as well and kind of almost blends into

92
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,710
her brows but I feel like I have a lot

93
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,420
more eyelid space in rocÃ­o so I'm just

94
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:55,130
gonna keep it more concentrated towards

95
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,630
the crease region I'm next time I go to

96
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,700
another clean and 4-3-3 brush and dip

97
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,590
into this shade right here and I'm gonna

98
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:03,170
pack this right here kind of in the

99
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,300
center of the eyelid her rainbow colors

100
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:08,030
are literally always so incredibly

101
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,470
pigmented and boy I have no idea what

102
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,550
the heck she does to get her shadow I

103
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,440
was like this I always have to build

104
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,700
them up so intensely I'm gonna go back

105
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,020
into the some more yellow and make sure

106
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,700
that those two colors are really

107
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,560
seamlessly blended together I'm mixing

108
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,360
to grab another clean and 4-3-3 and dip

109
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,400
into this bright blue shade right up in

110
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,780
this corner here and pop that right next

111
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,340
to the green a few weeks ago I did a

112
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,570
favorite brushes haul on my incertum

113
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,530
stories which is still highlighted by

114
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,010
the way so if you want to go check that

115
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,360
out

116
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,040
how'd it rich my tensor time and go look

117
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,870
at all my favorite brushes and of course

118
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,040
you get your discount but when I was

119
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,750
talking about blending brushes I of

120
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,310
course mentioned the m4a3 which you guys

121
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,680
saw was like my all-time favorite brush

122
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,030
and I said that I had 27 of these so

123
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,680
many people were like why the hell do

124
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:46,310
you need 27 of the same eyeshadow brush

125
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:48,890
well I already used three so far this is

126
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,900
why our next to go with a matte 514 and

127
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:54,370
dip into this bright purple shade and

128
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:56,570
use just to finish off my little outer V

129
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,070
how did she get her shadows to be so

130
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:00,320
pigmented I'm next to have a little bit

131
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:03,170
of my Mac select cover-up concealer and

132
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,030
I Mac 252 brush and I'm just going to

133
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:09,350
carve out a little bit of like a halo

134
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:11,900
eye type situation next I grab this

135
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:13,940
bright teal shade on a flat Packer brush

136
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,370
and I'm going to stretch it with some

137
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:18,770
mac fix+ to make that shadow

138
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:20,060
super duper intense and we're going to

139
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,959
pack that right on the center of that

140
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,940
little halo eye we just carved out

141
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,320
I'm gonna use those thing instead colors

142
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,000
I did before and create the same that

143
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,470
pattern of the rainbow just inside of

144
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,389
that little halo eye we carved out when

145
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,009
applying the shadows I'm more padding

146
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:34,169
and tapping them into place as opposed

147
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:35,910
to kind of like souping them and like

148
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:38,039
brushing them on in circular motions I

149
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,930
really want these clothes to be the most

150
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:41,759
pigmented they can possibly be and we're

151
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,139
gonna achieve that by packing them on

152
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,910
and then to really make that halo eye

153
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:49,199
pop I'm gonna grab the Mac reflex teal

154
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:52,039
and pop that right on the center I think

155
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:55,139
this came out like okay

156
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:56,400
damn Rocio has talent I did not think it

157
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,630
was gonna be this hard for the lower

158
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,009
lash that I'm gonna grab another fluffy

159
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,720
brush and go in with the bright red

160
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:04,860
shade and I'm gonna pop that right on at

161
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,599
the outer corner and then some orange

162
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,289
right in the middle of that lower lash

163
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:09,210
line

164
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:11,430
and then going back into the inner

165
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:13,470
corner with some of that yellow to

166
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,570
finish off the lower lash line at

167
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,979
Rainbow and last certainly not least for

168
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,810
the shadow portion of this look I'm

169
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:20,910
gonna go a just done some packing brush

170
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:22,590
from morphe and the sugar pills single

171
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:24,210
shadow in the shade taco this is

172
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,250
probably the most pigmented white eye

173
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:29,039
shadow there is this one is so so so

174
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,900
bomb I'm gonna dip right in it to that

175
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,060
shade and get a whole lot on the brush

176
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,520
and hopefully fingers crossed that this

177
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:40,680
foam star sticker works I'm gonna pop

178
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,970
this right here for my final reveal I

179
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,849
really hope this worked I'm gonna grab

180
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:48,030
some tweezers and I'm going to peel off

181
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:49,949
the star that is probably the worst I've

182
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:52,110
ever seen for once this is not my fault

183
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:53,190
I blame this one on the sticker and then

184
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,840
to finish off the stuff today I'm gonna

185
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,740
pop on the makeup shock lashes in the

186
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,750
style onyx

187
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,310
I know roseola loves these and uses

188
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,750
these all the time

189
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,680
okay guys that is what I all complete

190
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,120
I'm gonna go ahead and do the one

191
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,190
off-camera quickly and I'll be right

192
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,050
back with the finished roasty oh say hot

193
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,400
look okay that's that about one hour now

194
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,620
I am finished the other eye and I am

195
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,020
back with the completed look and I just

196
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:16,500
want to say good lord in heaven about

197
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:18,479
this was literally so hard to do like I

198
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,220
already had an immense amount of respect

199
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,520
for Rocio before as an artist but trying

200
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:26,130
to actually recreate her I'm a little

201
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,990
shocked right now this look is not my

202
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:29,550
best looking at the original picture her

203
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,860
blending work is impeccable her colors

204
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:34,500
are beyond pigmented and her crease is

205
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,060
so costly perfectly there's like a nice

206
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,470
bright

207
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,419
Shyne right in the middle and of course

208
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,950
her star on the inner corner is looking

209
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:41,090
perfect I think I got the entire look

210
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,919
the star was actually at the hardest

211
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,330
part but like I said blaming it on the

212
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:45,470
stickers I tried to outline it with some

213
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,419
white eyeliner to make it look a little

214
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:49,550
bit more defined but it is really not

215
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:51,050
looking the best major applause for her

216
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,520
and hats off because she's such a

217
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,780
talented artist like I said if you guys

218
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,360
do not know who she is or if you've not

219
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:59,300
seen her work before please go check her

220
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,610
out for a far far far better and more

221
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,919
talented version of this and yeah that

222
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:04,880
is the Rose feel look all complete okay

223
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,290
guys so the first thing I want to

224
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,030
recreate today was sent in by an artist

225
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:10,550
I follow on Twitter by the name of Ivy

226
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:12,710
kongu she is so incredibly talented and

227
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:14,300
so beautiful when she sent this that I

228
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,950
literally at guard I think I have a

229
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,690
really fun way to kind of put my own

230
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:19,190
twist on this when I saw this I just

231
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,080
thought it was so stunning the shadows

232
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:22,700
are so bright and pigmented and the

233
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,800
contrast between the shadows and her

234
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,440
skin color literally like so incredibly

235
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,389
beautiful so I'm gonna try my best to do

236
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,460
Ivies injustice and put my own sister

237
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:32,570
James twist on her look today okay so

238
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,850
I'm first gonna start by grabbing my

239
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:37,280
morphe M 513 fluffy brush and my

240
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:39,470
radioactive pigment from melt cosmetics

241
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,760
these shadows are so incredibly

242
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:43,010
pigmented and I really want this look to

243
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,510
be very very bright and vibrant so just

244
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,900
gonna take this on my brush and I'm

245
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:49,520
gonna pop this right on this inner

246
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,690
corner area I'm really gonna press that

247
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,860
shadow in there because we are going to

248
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,630
be covering out the crease so this can

249
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,910
be a little bit messy I just want these

250
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,890
colors to be extremely extremely vibrant

251
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:00,140
I'm next gotta good with my morphe i'ma

252
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:02,570
4-3-3 brush and dip into this bright

253
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,130
purple shade right up in here I'm gonna

254
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:06,260
use this to put it in my outer crease

255
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:07,340
and shape out an outer V as well once

256
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,169
again I'm gonna start off by really

257
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:11,030
packing this color in there and pressing

258
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:12,410
it end to make the colors super super

259
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,419
pigmented and then kind of go in

260
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,650
afterwards and blend them together I am

261
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:16,940
gonna be adding a winged liner so to

262
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,380
kind of follow through with that shape

263
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,150
I'm just gonna take that brush and I'm

264
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:22,250
going to press it right in on that outer

265
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:24,410
corner to kind of create that v-shape

266
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:26,690
and then just connect it up to that

267
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:27,800
crease region just like that before we

268
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,630
go in and blend out the edges because

269
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,800
they're looking a little bit wonky at

270
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,000
this point I'm going to take a little

271
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,070
bit more of that purple on the same

272
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,169
exact brush and packed it on the outer

273
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,550
lid just to get ready for the base of

274
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:38,810
that half-cooked crease

275
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,520
looking at Ivy's photo she definitely

276
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,630
has a very very high contrast in that

277
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,669
look so to add a little bit more

278
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,890
contrast to my look today I'm gonna go

279
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:47,370
my morphe I'm a 506 brush and dip into

280
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:49,740
it the black and the bottom

281
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,930
35b and i just a little bit of that in

282
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,130
the outer V be sure to not go crazy I'm

283
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,990
just gonna wiggle a little bit of the

284
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,970
shadow into that outer corner and kind

285
00:08:54,990 --> 00:09:00,560
of pull it out just do your slightest

286
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:03,300
bit just to add some more dimension and

287
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,830
that is plenty enough and I'm gonna go

288
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,360
back in with Maya I'm four three three

289
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:08,460
brush that I just used with that purple

290
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,220
shade dip into a little bit more purple

291
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,600
and then just go right over that edge so

292
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,060
to make sure that the block doesn't get

293
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,500
everywhere to carve out the half cut

294
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,540
crease I'm gonna use my steel out liquid

295
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,339
metals and the shade rose gold retro

296
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,660
this one is a little bit more orange

297
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:23,100
tone that I would have liked but I'm

298
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,900
gonna layer over top of it using the

299
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:29,390
Urban Decay glitter liner in this shade

300
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:29,390
grind to make it a little bit more pinky

301
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:35,160
I'm gonna dip back into that radioactive

302
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,410
pigment using another m4 3:3 brush and

303
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,050
I'm gonna go right over that edge

304
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:42,510
between the purple and the shadow we

305
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:44,550
just put down and then going back into

306
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:46,020
some more purple on the outer corner and

307
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,330
then like I said going into that urban

308
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:50,580
decay at glitter liner to make it more

309
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,200
pink other than that crease is cut for

310
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,390
the gods and all dried out I'm gonna add

311
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:58,220
a lilac liquid liner today using the la

312
00:09:54,390 --> 00:10:00,750
splash Pro artist liner in the shade

313
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:02,279
psychedelic this purple isn't as bright

314
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,800
as I want it to be so I'm gonna grab the

315
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:07,080
Makeup Forever aqua XL liner and this is

316
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,459
in the shade I don't even know it's the

317
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:13,650
light purple and I'm gonna go over top

318
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:14,580
of that with this I don't know what was

319
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,560
going on here but I was definitely

320
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,150
having some liner troubles I just

321
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,830
finished up the wing using that Makeup

322
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,510
Forever aqua XL liner and then use some

323
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,520
concealer to clean up below it because

324
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:25,529
it was getting a little bit messy but

325
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,209
for lust I'm gonna pop on something nice

326
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:29,130
and light and simple which of course you

327
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,810
guys know my Lily lashes in the style

328
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:32,430
Miami these are like at this point kind

329
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,200
of the only eye lashes I wear but

330
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,640
they're just so pretty and they'll fit

331
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,560
perfectly with this look because clearly

332
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,060
we want to show off what's going on on

333
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,560
the eyelid but my lower lash line roots

334
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,330
gonna go that same exact a dark purple

335
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,940
shade on my I'm 4-3-3 brush and pop this

336
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:49,050
in the outer corner right up against

337
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:50,700
that lash line then popping that pink

338
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:53,010
shade right on the inner corner to

339
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,810
connect it back up and then taking my

340
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:56,430
Abbot 1 v 1 brush and dipping into this

341
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:59,070
dark purple shade right down here I'm

342
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,490
mixing it with the slightest bit a black

343
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:02,200
I'm going to use this to connect

344
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,970
the outer corner up to the wing I'm

345
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,650
really hugging the shade right up

346
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,360
against that lashline because I don't

347
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:09,850
want everything to get too dark and

348
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,070
muddy and then just pulling this right

349
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:13,720
up against that lilac little wing I

350
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,100
really want my eyes to look big and have

351
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,870
a lot of attention drawn to them so I'm

352
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,570
next I grab my benefit high brow pencil

353
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:20,740
which is a pink like wax pencil this is

354
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,810
normally for highlighting your brows but

355
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,440
I'm pretty sure it's isafe don't quote

356
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,150
me on that

357
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,040
maybe don't have this at home but I'm

358
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:29,020
just gonna pop this right on the lower

359
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,770
lashline to really open my eyes and make

360
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:33,910
them look huge okay guys that is one eye

361
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,170
all complete for right now I definitely

362
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,820
have a few more things that I want to

363
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,960
add to this look but I'm gonna do the

364
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,520
other one off camera quickly to save

365
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,390
some time and I'll be right back all

366
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,860
right sighs design back with the

367
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,930
finished look but I'm honestly loving

368
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,190
how this looks so far sister I have you

369
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,870
put little hearts right here to kind of

370
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:49,150
fit together like the whole love theme

371
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:51,490
but we're gonna take it one step further

372
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:53,290
so I grab these like little glitter

373
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:55,060
hearts that I found in my clitoris we're

374
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:56,500
gonna even have these but I'm gonna pop

375
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,420
a little bit of these right underneath

376
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,130
my eyes to be like kind of a glitter to

377
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,750
your type of situation I'm just gonna

378
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,190
apply this using the violet Voss glitter

379
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:06,490
adhesive and just put a little bit of

380
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:10,780
this right up in here then just rushing

381
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:11,950
those on using up my finger and then

382
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,570
finally to finish off this look today

383
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:14,980
I'm going to add some heart freckles

384
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:17,020
using some different shades of pink and

385
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,310
purple liquid lipstick all from Oprah

386
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:21,310
these are in the shades of Laguna Beach

387
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:22,570
Las Vegas Panama and mocha and this

388
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:24,640
isn't forever I looked at I saw Nikita

389
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:27,840
drag and do it she looked so cute so I'm

390
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,840
gonna do it myself as well today

391
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:38,810
okay so honestly this look kind of got

392
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:40,280
real intense real fast I'm honestly not

393
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,180
sure if I'm loving the heart freckles

394
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,980
but you know what

395
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,750
I made the decision it is way too late

396
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,830
so we're gonna rock them now and I

397
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,000
finished off this look I'm just going to

398
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:52,280
go on in the ofra liquid lipstick in

399
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:54,650
Laguna Beach right guys and that is this

400
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,840
lovesick look inspired by sister ivy

401
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:58,190
kongu all complete this definitely was

402
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,990
not exactly what I envisioned it

403
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:01,310
originally but I am definitely really

404
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:04,190
proud of how this came out I think that

405
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:05,450
the eye look is literally so sunny I

406
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:07,160
definitely want to do a lot more looks

407
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:09,200
using this like pasta eyeliner I think

408
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,210
it's such a nice stark contrast from the

409
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,220
usual black liquid liner I'm honestly

410
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:14,510
like those looks really really bomb and

411
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,250
I hope you guys really really liked it

412
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:18,770
too and sister Ivy if you're watching I

413
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:20,540
hope I did you proud let's move on to

414
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:21,980
the next transformation okay so the next

415
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,650
thing I want to recreate today is this

416
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:28,430

drew on Twitter it is like this cool

421
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:37,790
tone or brown cut crease with a pop of

422
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,860
light blue in the inner corner I think

423
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:41,240
it is so stunning and so beautiful and

424
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,280
I've actually not done a cut crease at a

425
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,170
hot minute so I'm gonna do it this look

426
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,880
today please leave Nora my nose baking

427
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,440
as well I've had to take off part of my

428
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,090
makeup like three times out there at the

429
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,560
point of this video to try to do all

430
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:53,990
these looks and one day this has been a

431
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,720
really intense but assisters nose needs

432
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:58,130
to be snatched no matter what so just

433
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,510
roll with me here okay so when Drew's

434
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,740
look she definitely knows like all whole

435
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:02,690
Tom Browns and I actually don't have a

436
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,820
single palette that's like all cool

437
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,650
tones I definitely need to get that so

438
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:08,300
if you know of any lettuce sister no but

439
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:10,400
I'm gonna be using the morphe 39a today

440
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,230
because I feel like they're like you

441
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,610
cool tone Browns up in here we're gonna

442
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,530
make it work I'm first gonna start my

443
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:17,270
carving Miami 513 which is a fluffy

444
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:18,110
blending brush and dipping into this

445
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,730
light brown

446
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:21,050
cool tool in transition shade and

447
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:23,060
putting this in the shape of a cut

448
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:24,410
crease when I do my cut crease I like to

449
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,330
keep the shadows focused kind of above

450
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:27,800
the lid just for a more lifted and

451
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:29,660
really really large eye look but you can

452
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,470
obviously place your shadows wherever

453
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,000
your heart desires

454
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,100
I'm gonna grab a slightly smaller

455
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,060
blending brush this is the M 4-3-3 you

456
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,320
guys know I have like literally a

457
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,180
million of these in my collection in it

458
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,220
they're so good and I'm gonna dip into

459
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,420
this slightly darker brown shade it

460
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,650
right up in here and use this to it to

461
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,330
find out the crease a little bit more

462
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,590
I'm just gonna play says once again in

463
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,400
that same shape following my natural

464
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,590
crease and

465
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,690
pulling it out towards the end screw

466
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:52,640
that cut crease shape that we all know

467
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:54,740
and love to finish off the shadow

468
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,500
portion already on my m56 too and dip

469
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:59,810
into this kind of slightly warm tone of

470
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,820
cranberry dark brown up in here and I'm

471
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:03,590
gonna pop this just the slightest bit in

472
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,210
the crease I really like using this to

473
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:06,650
just get the slightest bit of definition

474
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:08,300
in cut creases and stuff like that

475
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,710
because you're able to kind of put the

476
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,780
color on and bonds it out at the same

477
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,740
time without putting it everywhere now

478
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,360
that we have the general shape and

479
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,980
blending of the cut crease all complete

480
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,450
I wonder grabbed as any folk harbors

481
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,510
concealer this is the max I like to

482
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,680
cover up and I'm gonna be using the Mac

483
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:23,390
252 brush I just found this from

484
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,100
Mitchell and Stacy Maria I'm doing an

485
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,540
Instagram and I have been obsessed with

486
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:30,770
this brush recently and I'm just gonna

487
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:32,540
use this to carve out my crease okay so

488
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,650
don't do what I just did and rush

489
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,710
through the carving of the crease

490
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:39,110
because it clearly this is not the shape

491
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:40,730
that we're going for today I was

492
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,860
definitely a way too confident and that

493
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:43,580
crease cutting situation so let's try

494
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:49,040
this again

495
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:50,300
I used to be literally so good at cut

496
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,340
crease is what is going on right now

497
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,470
okay doing this cut crease that I just

498
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:56,420
humbled me right off it has been a way

499
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:58,610
too long since I've done one clearly it

500
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:00,590
is showing in this work here this is not

501
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,790
my best status for sure but we're gonna

502
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:03,980
keep on talking and hopefully those will

503
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,690
come together at the end I'm gonna grab

504
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,160
a tiny brush just like this I dip into

505
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:09,050
the same dark brown shade and start

506
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,310
sketching out my wing just like a

507
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:13,880
regular wing liner I'm gonna pull this

508
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:14,990
right up out from the outer corner I'm

509
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,940
gonna pull the shade a little bit under

510
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:18,230
the lower lash line as well does because

511
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,880
we are obviously gonna be putting shadow

512
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:22,430
there so that helps get the wing shape

513
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,780
nice and correct I'm gonna use this same

514
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,370
shadow to lately pack on the shape of a

515
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,450
winged liner and not making this too

516
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,710
thick because we're gonna be doing a

517
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:29,540
little bit of an ombre waiting today

518
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,890
grabbing our original transition shade

519
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,050
I'm gonna grab a small fluffy brush just

520
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:34,970
like this one and lightly go over the

521
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:40,670
edge to kind of buff and blend it out so

522
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:42,380
we have an ombre a wing so that is the

523
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:44,930
ombre smoky liner all complete but

524
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,610
clearly it got a little bit messy so I'm

525
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:47,840
gonna go Miami four three two you guys

526
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,130
know this is my favorite concealer brush

527
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,870
for doing under the brows but it's also

528
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,950
great because it's flat so I'm gonna

529
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,960
grab just a little bit more of that

530
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:57,440
concealer and I'm going to lightly go

531
00:16:53,960 --> 00:17:00,710
over that edge and cut out the

532
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,730
there we go now we're talking since we

533
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,960
already went ahead and put a little bit

534
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,910
of that darkness on the lower lash line

535
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,380
it from before all I'm gonna do is grab

536
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:08,480
my original transition sheet on a fluffy

537
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,490
brush and just bring that right under

538
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,980
the lower lash line connecting it up top

539
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:14,990
to that wing and just finishing it off

540
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,910
for the pop-up blue in the inner corner

541
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:19,160
I'm gonna grab my morphia 35 B palette

542
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:21,350
and just any old fluffy brush this one

543
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,570
will do this happens to be another 33

544
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:24,800
I'm gonna dip it right into right here

545
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:26,720
and just pop this right in the inner

546
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,860
corner I'm not gonna put too much blue

547
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,680
here because we definitely want to do a

548
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:32,480
light base so the pigment really picks

549
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,800
up that blue sheen and then finally for

550
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,900
that pop in the inner corner I'm gonna

551
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,270
grab my Mac reflex teal this is my

552
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,080
all-time favorite glitter slosh penguins

553
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,400
I don't even know what this would be

554
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,690
considered but whatever it doesn't

555
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,270
matter I'm gonna pop that right in the

556
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:46,040
inner corner that is what I'm talking

557
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:48,710
about oh my god this is so pretty

558
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:54,950
I love this then I'm just gonna pop on a

559
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:56,540
wispy pair of lashes all right sister

560
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,860
status one eye all complete I feel like

561
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:00,290
for the amount of issues we were having

562
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:02,210
earlier on we somehow managed to pull it

563
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:03,590
together this is looking so beautiful so

564
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,910
far but I'm gonna go in and do the other

565
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,650
one off camera quickly and I'll be right

566
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:08,000
back with the finished look all right

567
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:09,770
guys I am back with the other eye all

568
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,810
complete this one was much easier to do

569
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,940
off camera thank God I don't know what

570
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:15,410
was going on here but I think we

571
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,700
definitely pulled this together to

572
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:18,620
finish off the look I decided some more

573
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,390
glow and some more highlighter anasazi

574
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:22,100
yeah so Hollywood as always and then I

575
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,570
paired the lip with Anasazi Ashtyn

576
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,640
liquid lipstick and this is the

577
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:27,560
completed look inspired by it make Dru

578
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,960
Marquez and those are all three looks

579
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,820
complete for the day whoo my face has

580
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,860
