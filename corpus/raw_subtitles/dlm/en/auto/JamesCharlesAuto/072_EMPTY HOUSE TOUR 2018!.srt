00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:18,630
mr. James Turrell let's hear it come

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:21,150
back to my house you got for today's

3
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,850
brand-new video we're going to do it a

4
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,439
sister sanctuary to us but you think

5
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:36,120
about two years ago now I officially

6
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:37,920
moved to Los Angeles to pursue my really

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,690
close friends were all in Orange County

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,059
and Whittier so it was kind of right

9
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,620
smack dab in the middle no job town was

10
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,610
a really really good and fun impressed

11
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:50,280
for about five days and after that if

12
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,629
then we want to dot every single day how

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,460
do you guys to see that the constant

14
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:55,379
mental breakdowns over the sirens over

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,539
the lemon ways it over the sky people

16
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:58,980
are going out late at night and also the

17
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,719
imminent issues have really affected

18
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,019
them on YouTube have a growth this past

19
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,180
year it's been a initiate simply so

20
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,250
regardless the Asian is now over cuz

21
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:13,890
I've been saving quality have a big

22
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:15,479
sister sponsorships and we were

23
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,759
obviously the movie bless us right now I

24
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:21,810
just kissed my downtown America goodbye

25
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,369
sister sayonara never ever but it was

26
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,900
empty through so many of them every sip

27
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:29,369
each other but not we are here we're

28
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,229
very much I mean right now in the movers

29
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:32,609
secondly remember that Ana put it all

30
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,500
before we do that in circles and getting

31
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:36,450
it set up I was just doing a little bit

32
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,799
of an empty house work for you guys

33
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,479
I thought they did plan on doing a

34
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,950
finished house crawler and kind of a

35
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,090
little bit of a decorating series as

36
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,799
well because you guys know I really

37
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,060
really love interior design so I thought

38
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,319
it would be actually really cool to do

39
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,759
an empty house write a finished house

40
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:49,469
tomorrow so you guys can really see the

41
00:01:47,759 --> 00:02:10,590
before the planning process and the dog

42
00:01:49,469 --> 00:02:12,480
have a little HGTV they are shaking so

43
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,730
hard and I was gonna make the black and

44
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,060
white and answer em selfies personal

45
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,060
problems

46
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:25,049
the reconnaissance do you do before and

47
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:26,700
there's a beautiful quiet please I think

48
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:29,670
this would be a little chill and I

49
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,470
really would put a couch in this general

50
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,930
vicinity somewhere and there's gonna be

51
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,940
a grand you know right there in this

52
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,160
corner but my god you know obviously

53
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,260
music plays a huge role in my life and I

54
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,850
do play the keyboard of my ear but I've

55
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,500
been wanting a grand piano since I was a

56
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,430
little boy we could never afford ads

57
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,290
have been there growing up and Aaron

58
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,440
Burr saving up for a little keyboard it

59
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,209
was on for months as a child so my wife

60
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,880
a grand piano has been a huge role but I

61
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:55,630
don't know

62
00:02:51,880 --> 00:03:00,160
it's gonna be right here it's in the

63
00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:01,930
linear pathway and then I can play over

64
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,700
the speakers in the ceiling there are

65
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,980
all hardwired so I can listen to my box

66
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:15,160
anywhere in the house all day long

67
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:16,960
really what I wanted to do individual

68
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,820
house to begin with I think just really

69
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,710
cool to kind of bring a little nostalgic

70
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:24,550
element from the Delta apartment back

71
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:29,080
here to this house and beautiful I think

72
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:36,790
a huge table for amenities you're

73
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:38,320
probably just gonna protect it right

74
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,790
here I honestly don't worry anticipate

75
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,690
you think this room very often is

76
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,850
probably gonna be one of those rooms

77
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,110
that are very much first show all the

78
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,880
way eating will probably be happening

79
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:47,470
and my bed or on the couch in the living

80
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,270
room which you guys will see in a second

81
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,700
or at the kitchen counter because it's a

82
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:59,540
huge movie like tonight over here and

83
00:03:51,700 --> 00:04:01,400
this is a big open foyer area and family

84
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,799
and everything right now I'm gonna be

85
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,390
helping contribute to do job great but

86
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:06,530
there's going to be a car park there

87
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,670
eventually

88
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,720
you guys know obviously I'm your uber

89
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:13,340
everywhere and I think it's time for me

90
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,019
to get a card now that I have a house I

91
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,840
guess it's a lot but I actually do have

92
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:19,780
my license I can drive I'm just really

93
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,949
not good at it so if you find out about

94
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,270
i-19 you know makeup artist crushin

95
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:34,340

96
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:37,340
the news this this absolutely my office

97
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:39,440
for myself my team at worst or did you

98
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,760
tell me just myself I do now have an

99
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,740
amazing group of people that work with

100
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:45,050
me every single day to make this full of

101
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,400
video consoles possible and make sure

102
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,020
they have a really comfortable and

103
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,850
beautiful and bright thanks to work

104
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,440
that's why they can be happening right

105
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,270
in here so the way the office we have

106
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,570
this beautiful

107
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,570
[Music]

108
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:08,819
and here it's too cute little room for

109
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:11,349
many guests that are over I love the

110
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:15,099
same things too like this is so cool

111
00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:16,960
it's like a fire hose love that some

112
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:20,440
water it's so vintage and then in here

113
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,810
this is supposed to be the office space

114
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,000
it's just literally a white box but if I

115
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,229
have a missus way too small if I were to

116
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,330
be working here I would probably get

117
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:30,639
really stressed and like cram and

118
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,110
washable recognize it a little bit so

119
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,419
that we can hear my house positive

120
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,830
potential of like a recording studio and

121
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:39,430
my start shaking use it more seriously

122
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:41,560
but really fun but now for a house is

123
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,210
really Deku sticks so coming out of the

124
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,490
it sisters to do times potential

125
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:49,080
exercise rooms large white box that I

126
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,080
can lock it in and he's being annoying

127
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,879
whenever that cooking made me back to

128
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:56,620
the foyer this is going to be a wall of

129
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,310
the entire house and this is obviously a

130
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,500
wine cellar

131
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,700
while James why does your wine cellar at

132
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,950
your favorite wall at the entire house

133
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,420
let me tell you why I'm here all the

134
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:54,230
internals because guess what's not going

135
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:57,860
to be there why because it's very just

136
00:06:54,230 --> 00:07:00,350
then was insane well that's very much

137
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,640
material we know these two kinda way

138
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,960
exploding we're talk which are actually

139
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,030
the only two lights I'm going to be

140
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,620
keeping in this house I really love this

141
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:08,330
I think they are so beautiful and kind

142
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,710
of odd to have like the rustic farmhouse

143
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,120
back which is definitely what I want to

144
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:14,920
go for I'm gonna have a coffee machine

145
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,920
probably in there

146
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,219
when I'm getting too lazy to cook those

147
00:07:16,809 --> 00:07:19,629
days and that huge beautiful

148
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:51,129
refrigerator which I will probably keep

149
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:52,300
very little if there is that night but

150
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:54,669
one of the main issues with is the

151
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,469
projectors times day based light meaning

152
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:58,120
I can never watch anything during the

153
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:59,169
day which is usually pretty good for it

154
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,210
I was able to really keep some

155
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:03,009
self-control and to get my work done but

156
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:05,139
there are definitely days where that's

157
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:07,180
built watching out like something a huge

158
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:09,580
TV right smack dab in the middle right

159
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:17,610
here we talked about some of the core

160
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:17,610
pieces and huge l-shaped sectional right

161
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,430
friendly to my moving up process and

162
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,169
I'll show you guys the little backyard

163
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:41,849
moment how these dogs are also here -

164
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:43,260
they will not be staying unfortunately

165
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:45,420
but me and definitely do plan on

166
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:47,610
adopting a puppy as soon as we get in

167
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,959
and get some I am so beyond excited

168
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,940
so students about that side there is a a

169
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,520
huge TV and fireplace which i think is

170
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,839
actually so so so cool I want to put a

171
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,279
cute little seating area here so I mean

172
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,529
all my friends kids show up during it

173
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:01,200
the cool summer nights and then we have

174
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:02,850
these beautiful backyard so the grass

175
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,589
area is definitely not as big as I would

176
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,300
want to be I grew up in upstate New York

177
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:08,160
and I'm used to having a ton of property

178
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,560
I think the house that I grew up in was

179
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,570
literally five acres which is any

180
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,470
nature-lovers tree which may come as a

181
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,940
little bit of a surprise to you guys

182
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,920
because I'm very much an inside home

183
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,630
Internet kid but I definitely do love

184
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,890
nature and the rocks and so my next

185
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,990
house that I move into will have a huge

186
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:23,580
backyard I'm promising myself that right

187
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,830
now but I think I'm just gonna put a

188
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,660
hammock over here maybe some lawn chairs

189
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:29,670
next to of the pool and probably gonna

190
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,500
fix this dead of grass patch because

191
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,600
it's not looking the best

192
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:37,589

have this little concrete and girl area

195
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,300
similar to the kitchen I'm probably not

196
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:44,250
gonna get a whole lot of use out of this

197
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,570

198
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,670

actually 5 bedrooms which is so much my

215
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,500

216
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,940

walk-in closet and the other one with my

218
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,320
filming space and the lock was button so

219
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,940
even though I had a three bedroom it was

220
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,320
only really what was being used and

221
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,730

225
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,690

227
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:08,810
one day and they're very very close to a

228
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:10,339
lot of the people in my leg I like to

229
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,870
just make them feel at home and make

230
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:19,449
them feel confident self this house is

231
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:21,709
gonna be crazy to you but it is a

232
00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:23,600
laundry room and do you know why I'm

233
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:25,490
excited about this because I have a

234
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,860
washer and dryer and I'm going to be

235
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,420
able to do my own laundry why are you

236
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,850
excited about that James your house can

237
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,100
but let me tell you if you get to see in

238
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:35,660
a few episodes of brother and sister

239
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,130
meeting to talk about how the lottery my

240
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,500
own

241
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,940
it was scary it was in the basement it

242
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,160
was dark all the machines were broken

243
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:44,199
almost every single time I literally

244
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,360
left loads of laundry in there and came

245
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:47,829
down like five minutes before my local

246
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,750
machine was going to be done I don't

247
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:51,519
have people taking my clothes out of the

248
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:54,910
machine because they wanted to cut

249
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,470
there's any staff like that it's scary

250
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,639
so I've been working as long as I was

251
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,860
really generous to make sure my clothes

252
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:01,149
were clean and not drugs but I'm so

253
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,130
excited to be able to actually get my

254
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:04,630
laundry done myself make sure it's done

255
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:06,639
right to do it safely

256
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:08,980
it sounds so stupid but I'm just really

257
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:13,240
excited about so one over this table you

258
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:18,430
have this big storage unit that you're

259
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:20,500
covering every single day second is not

260
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:21,970
the actual Vegas - I hope that you'll

261
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,620
even focus on production rather than

262
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,000
make up storage because you guys know I

263
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,800
don't only switch up my products that

264
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,959
often so I can actually use this entire

265
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,850
storage unit to store access paper and

266
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,850
then walking up from here we have a

267
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:36,550
bedroom number two

268
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,829
in truth and the poor cousin it's really

269
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:40,839
beautiful and bright and you know really

270
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:42,430
like this space there's also a pretty

271
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:44,380
thing I can all fit in here of course is

272
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:46,540
revealed as well which I'm excited for

273
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,550
obviously you know really really loves

274
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,529
fashion luck and he wants to be a

275
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:52,329
regular blogger or 2,000 videos on

276
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:54,459
YouTube one day if he ever actually

277
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:55,720
decides to post couldn't tell you I'm

278
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:57,579
gonna be a song and when he comes here I

279
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,899
was hip-hop but they'll be able to use

280
00:12:57,579 --> 00:13:01,360
this woful supposed to distill all his

281
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:03,190
pieces in here to beautiful for his

282
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,290
videos obviously like make sure you guys

283
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:08,019
have entered the house or maybe is done

284
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:09,790
move on to the next row so I'm walking

285
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:13,050
up right out over here we have a bedroom

286
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,050
number three

287
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:27,250
this one is Ted or that guest room just

288
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:28,540
just a super simple room so as of right

289
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,829
now it's probably only going to be the

290
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,480
median sister Keehan living and this

291
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:32,709
comes together but we are they gonna dog

292
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,970
and you guys heard me say that my team

293
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:36,100
was here almost every single day working

294
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:37,660
was really fun I do have actually gonna

295
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,009
have a third roommate kinda trying to

296
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,110
convince and that's been true to move in

297
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:44,410
with us no but sometimes the English

298
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:46,779
inaudible you comment on us because any

299
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,990
one day in this room or the other would

300
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:50,410
be

301
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:52,209
Giroux perfectly fine guestroom throw my

302
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,680
family or my best friends coming over so

303
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:56,500
we write a lot with this program you

304
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,819
have such a numbers door and this is my

305
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,689
favorite bedroom that is not the master

306
00:13:57,819 --> 00:14:00,689
of the entire house

307
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,560
there's so great and it is so big the

308
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,660
ceilings are actually involved in as

309
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,520
opposed to flat which really just makes

310
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,350
the space feel like a million times

311
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,420
larger and it just feels very very old

312
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:19,530
Beth and it just is really good advise

313
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:20,820
for production videos and it can be

314
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:22,890
really easy to get into a bit of a

315
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,450
creative rut so for me can you get a

316
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:26,640
space that makes me feel happy and the

317
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:28,620
life of a week is super super important

318
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,800
that's our space outside because the

319
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:33,870
closet isn't actually the big s but

320
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,370
maybe issue later on but like I say I do

321
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:37,710
want to make sure to go to my connection

322
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:40,170
and just don't really like what I'm

323
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:42,330
saying let's make a huge donation of

324
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:44,010
open and bread and makeup products that

325
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:46,020
a bumpy our have just never actually

326
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:48,630
used to a local organ something wasn't

327
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:51,030
that so so so much to me they were all

328
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:52,410
so grateful and so thankful and it's

329
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,430
really laughing because I just do guys

330
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,320
like that they pretend to be all the

331
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,820
time and although I am so thankful for

332
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,740
it there is just a nobody that I'd ever

333
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,030
be able to try all that much makeup so

334
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,440
we just want to have art to be able to

335
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,760
give that stuff away to people who are

336
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,590
definitely going to get an amazing do

337
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,810
some of that and we so so so appreciate

338
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:08,820
about that so that's actually the intera

339
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:10,320
of you need space I'm suppose to all

340
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,690

349
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:36,209
but since it's just me it's going to be

350
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,639
the sister and sisters closet which I

351
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:39,750
obviously love just like I make up my

352
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,819
cash they went through had donated

353
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:56,370
probably like 50 percent of the items

354
00:16:41,819 --> 00:17:00,090
that I never wear any beautiful
