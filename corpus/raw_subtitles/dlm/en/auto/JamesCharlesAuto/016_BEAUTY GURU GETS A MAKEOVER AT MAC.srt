00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,330

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,359
cutting straight to the point

4
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:08,099
hello everybody we are back and we are

5
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:09,420
sitting down for episode two of this

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,620

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,750

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,699

it's on where we got my makeup done at

12
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,140
Sephora it was so much fun for today's

13
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,330
video we're going to be going to match

14
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,500
to get the same full glam makeover I

15
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,330
made my appointment and we're gonna be

16
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,730
heading out in a few minutes but before

17
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,349
we do that I definitely wanna make a few

18
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,270
quick disclaimers because some people

19
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,309
majorly missed the point of last week's

20
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,870
video and this entire series while a lot

21
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:38,129
of you guys definitely loved the first

22
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,899
makeover video if there was a lot of

23
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:41,489
people that misinterpreted the point of

24
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,719
the video first of all I can't even

25
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:43,770
reiterate how many times I've said it

26
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,750
throughout the video but apparently

27
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,489
y'all's ears were closed the artists in

28
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,469
the video asked for word did such an

29
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,180
amazing job I'm gonna leave the artists

30
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:52,890
Instagram right here her name is crystal

31
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,390
marine go like her last post and go

32
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,460
comment saying sister James sent you and

33
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,809
show her the love because she did such

34
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,609
an amazing job and I don't know why so

35
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:01,020
many people were thinking that the point

36
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,480
of the video was for me to shine on her

37
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,040
because it was not during prom season of

38
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,869
all season event season and wedding

39
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,310
season so many people go to these

40
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:09,689
various different stores and get their

41
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,729
makeup done in order to feel beautiful

42
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:12,930
and confident on their special day at

43
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:14,369
the end of each makeover we're gonna

44
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,049
come right back here I'm going to show

45
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:17,250
you guys the finished look and then

46
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:18,420
we're going to talk about it every

47
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,100
different makeup store trains their

48
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,390
artists in different ways and every

49
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,250
artist has different styles and

50
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,540
techniques that they do makeup in which

51
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,189
is why I think that this series is such

52
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,360
a cool and fun idea to be able to

53
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:29,310
showcase different artists different

54
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,960
styles and different techniques and then

55
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,579
how they may differ from my very own

56
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,110
that you guys get to see all the time

57
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:35,880
obviously I'm not gonna like everything

58
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,170
that they do on me and if I was to do

59
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,460
the makeup on them I'm sure they would

60
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,070
not like everything that I was gonna do

61
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,630
on them either and that is totally okay

62
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,979
I'm not gonna sit here and drag any

63
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,180
artists because the whole point of

64
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,619
getting your makeup done is to have a

65
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,990
different style than your own which is

66
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:49,860
the whole fun behind it but I will talk

67
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,570
about things that I would have done

68
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,159
differently or preferred so therefore

69
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,780
you guys are watching me from makeup

70
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,820
tips can get a rough idea of what your

71
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,960
makeup or experience may be like if you

72
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,579
want to get your glam done at one of

73
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,170
these places so you can make it more

74
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:02,790
educated decision next time you have a

75
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,170
special event to go to and finally

76
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,280
before we get this video started the

77
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,810
last thing I want to address is the

78
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,700
comment about me of being treated like a

79
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,899
normal customer at Sephora I want to be

80
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,459
able to give you guys an accurate

81
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,620
rotation of what a normal makeover at

82
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:14,879
one of these stores may look like but

83
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,290
that can sometimes do you really really

84
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,790
hard when the employees know who you are

85
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,049
there have definitely been times in the

86
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,280
past where I've walked into various

87
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:22,319
different makeup stores and have been

88
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,519
greeted with special treatment I've seen

89
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,200
a lot of different products before they

90
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:26,220
actually hit the shelves I've gotten

91
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,840
products that were supposed to be out of

92
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,939
stock and I've also gotten different

93
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,349
things for free because of my name I do

94
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:33,120
want to apologize if I came out as

95
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:34,650
entitled or conceited in the last video

96
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,390
I definitely missed the mark on what I

97
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,159
wanted to say so I'm very very sorry for

98
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,290
that I do not think of myself as any

99
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,909
higher than any other artist I'm just a

100
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,220
normal HTML kid with a few blending

101
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:45,810
brushes like my Instagram bio says but I

102
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,549
did want to address that because it has

103
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,379
happened in the past it's just the

104
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:51,150
reality of the situation it's really not

105
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,530
that deep all about being sent though

106
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,329
there is no denying that I have worked

107
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,069
my ass off to become a name in this

108
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:57,150
industry if you hate me if you hate my

109
00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:58,980
videos if you hate the way I do my

110
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:02,250
makeup if you hate the way I talk that's

111
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,840
totally fine but word of advice stop

112
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,579
watching my videos stop commenting and

113
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,200
stop talking about me because you're the

114
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:08,310
ones keeping me relevant on that

115
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,900
trending page I'm alright that is

116
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,099
everything I have to say I hope that

117
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,959
cleared everything up and without

118
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:19,829
further ado let's head over to Mac and

119
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:22,199
get our damn makeup done alright guys so

120
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:24,090
we are back home from our Mac make over

121
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:25,549
my appointment was at 4 o'clock today

122
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,620
and we just got home and is currently

123
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:30,419
601 actually and was about 15 minutes of

124
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,620
travel time there and back it was

125
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:33,269
probably about an hour and a half

126
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,909
appointment total so it definitely not

127
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:37,230
bad for a full glam make over my artist

128
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:38,729
today was named Helen and you can find

129
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:40,319
her an Instagram and I heart Helen

130
00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:42,180
definitely go show her all the love from

131
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,400
his sisters tell her sister James sent

132
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,229
you she was so sweet and so nice and

133
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,940
just like the last video my artist did

134
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:49,409
not know who I was and one point she

135
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,909
asked me if I was a youtuber and I was

136
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:52,680
like yes girl but I only have a small

137
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:54,090
channel which may have been a little bit

138
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,769
of apply because all your sisters out

139
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,120
there know how big we have become we are

140
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:58,379
so close to 2 million subscribers so

141
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,389
definitely click that subscribe button

142
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:02,549
if you have not already but she was so

143
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:04,139
sweet and so nice without further ado

144
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:06,120
let's pull in this mirror and look at

145
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:07,379
this makeup a super close-up so before

146
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,299
we actually went in and started on at

147
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:10,680
the glam makeup today I showed my artist

148
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,120
a picture of two makeup look that I

149
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,829
wanted being the same exact one from the

150
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,940
last video I'm Jacqueline Hale it is

151
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:16,199
right here just in case you need a

152
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,840
little bit of a reminder but I'm gonna

153
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,919
be asking for the

154
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,600
same look from all the different places

155
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,470
that might go I know a lot of you guys

156
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,790
in the last video we're definitely

157
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,169
commenting that it was kind of stupid

158
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,060
for me to just tell the artist to do

159
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:26,380
whatever they want because as the client

160
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,090
you are definitely supposed to ask for

161
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,949
what you want in order for the artist to

162
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,750
give it to you which I agree with so

163
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:33,370
once I showed her the photo I clarified

164
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,660
that I wanted book Herbert Foundation a

165
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,300
lot of glow

166
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,979
not too much bronzer and a more snatched

167
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,360
nose and she said okay to all those

168
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:41,500
things which I thought was really really

169
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,210
great to give her a little bit in board

170
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,830
direction based on my personal

171
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,510
preferences so therefore the end result

172
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,949
won't be judged on personal preference

173
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,970
things because a lot of people were

174
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:51,070
really mad about that in the last video

175
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,210
don't worry I got you

176
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,560
so the first thing that she did was

177
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,330
start off with priming my face and she

178
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,770
actually used a Mac of BB cream which is

179
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,330
saying that I've never seen done before

180
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,100
she said it was a light and sticky base

181
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:01,690
to make the skin a more natural and even

182
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,460
off the route for the foundation process

183
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:05,530
later on she next one into my brows

184
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,419
using a Mac brow pencil and I honestly

185
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,979
really really like how the brows turned

186
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:10,570
out I felt like she added a really

187
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:12,550
really nice perk she definitely did not

188
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,680
make them too thick and I definitely

189
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,510
love love love all the love that she

190
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,919
defined the tail and pulled it out as

191
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,510
well as many of you guys know I've

192
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,310
recently been try to make my tails more

193
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,870
out as opposed to more down which allows

194
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:25,180
for a lot more eyeshadow shape these

195
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,800
furrows are definitely a huge win in my

196
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,030
book next was the eyes then she first

197
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,500
started off by priming them using the

198
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,150
Mac painterly paint-pot

199
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,530
which is a Paint Pot that like literally

200
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,970
every beauty guru in the entire world

201
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,530
uses except for me for some reason

202
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,669
I have no vendetta against it I just

203
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,680
have never actually gotten around to

204
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,760
buying one but she used it today and I

205
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,440
think it worked beautifully as a

206
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,210
eyeshadow base I really do plan on

207
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,680
trying it out eventually I sort of go

208
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,270
ahead and then for the eye shadows today

209
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,419
she used the Mac single shadows in the

210
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:51,970
shade soft and gentle brown script I'm

211
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:56,320
into it Swiss chocolate sweet heat and

212
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:58,300
nylon and this my look is really really

213
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,330
good looking at the eye shadow close-up

214
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:04,060
I am so so chef this honestly looks

215
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,500
really really good as you guys can see

216
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,940
there was a really really smooth and

217
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,310
even transition between of course the

218
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,080
problem highly the transition shade the

219
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,700
deeper shade in the crease the darker

220
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,200
shade in the outer corner and then even

221
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,810
there's a smooth transition between the

222
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,880
metallic shade on the lid which is so so

223
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,620
well done she even went ahead and added

224
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,210
a black winged liner to this look I'm

225
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,979
actually not even sure if Jacqueline has

226
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,240
a wing on in the original photo you

227
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:26,050
really can't tell based on the angle

228
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,849
that her face and

229
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:30,220
is that but she went ahead and out of it

230
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:32,080
anyway and this liner is so good too

231
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,190
she used a gel liner which I was really

232
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,139
really spooked about when she pulled it

233
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:37,539
out because doing a really really even

234
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:38,710
and tiny precise winged liner with a gel

235
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:41,050
is not the easiest thing in the world

236
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:43,000
but she absolutely slated this liner

237
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,800
it's ready to cut a [ __ ] that is for

238
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,539
sure on the lower waterline she lines

239
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,280
that using a block I call it and then

240
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:50,440
blend it out using the brown script

241
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,879
eyeshadow I believe I don't think once

242
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,259
again in the photo of Jacqueline she has

243
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:54,849
black in her water line but it

244
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:56,259
definitely is a very very smoky look and

245
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:58,060
I really really love how this turned on

246
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:59,979
as well I actually think I prefer this

247
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,629
over the light water line I haven't done

248
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:03,580
black in the water line for a smoky look

249
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,840
in the longest time ever but honestly I

250
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,539
really really missed this because it

251
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,490
makes my eyes well my contacts pop so so

252
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:11,319
much when it came to the lashes once

253
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,250
again I did ask for falsies and I didn't

254
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:14,349
catch the name of these ones

255
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,509
unfortunately but they were Mac branded

256
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:18,159
and I was really really spooked because

257
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:19,990
they were like the original size and I

258
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:22,030
was like girl my eyes are very very tiny

259
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,020
I usually cut a lot off the lashes and

260
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:26,530
she measured him and she's like oh

261
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:28,360
you're fine and I was like woah okay but

262
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:30,610
she actually glued on the full band and

263
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,840
she glued them on so well I don't know

264
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:33,400
what she did I don't know what she used

265
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,860
but I need her to glue my lashes

266
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,539
everyday because they looked so good I

267
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,250
literally cannot feel them either and I

268
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:40,750
have no idea like how this is even going

269
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,979
on the way eyes right now but I'm not

270
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,659
even gonna ask questions I'm just gonna

271
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:46,210
appreciate the thought that somebody was

272
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:48,310
able to glue and a full eyelash onto my

273
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:49,599
eyelid and it feels amazing after the

274
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:51,039
eyes came the base makeup and like I

275
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,500
told you guys I definitely did ask for a

276
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,599
fall Carmen foundation scioscia end of

277
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,740
the Studio Fix fluid foundation which is

278
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,599
definitely full coverage if you are

279
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,930
familiar with Mac products and she mix

280
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:03,159
together the shades NW 13 and C 4 and I

281
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,690
think that this is one of the best

282
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:06,520
foundation not just I have ever had in

283
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,960
my entire life she then went ahead and

284
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,580
used the lightest shade in the Mac Pro

285
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,719
conceal palette to highlight under my

286
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,370
eyes and in the center of the forehead

287
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:14,620
and she actually blended out this entire

288
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:16,509
look using one of those triangular throw

289
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,819
out Beauty sponges which I was so so

290
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:20,169
surprised and impressed by obviously at

291
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:21,610
places like Sephora or alter you're

292
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:23,710
gonna have Beauty blenders but obviously

293
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,879
Mac it does not have those so I was so

294
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,979
impressed that she somehow managed to

295
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,590
get such an even and go to blend using

296
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:31,060
those tiny-ass drugstore sponges so once

297
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,680
the foundation and concealer were all on

298
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,480
and blended out she went ahead and set

299
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,460
my face using the Mac prep

300
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,260
powder which I will say is not my

301
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,430
favorite looking closely at Lumiere it

302
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,050
definitely is starting to wear down a

303
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:42,460
little bit under my eyes as you can see

304
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:44,440
there's some creases up in this region

305
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,960
and then also around the mouth and if I

306
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,460
touch my face it is a little bit tacky

307
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,480
this is totally personal preference but

308
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,280
I do wish she would have applied a

309
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,510
little bit more powder to my face to

310
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,950
really lock it in place and make sure it

311
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:55,240
stayed all night long because if I was

312
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,500
wearing this out I feel like I

313
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,210
definitely would start to sweat the

314
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,650
makeup off a little bit

315
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,880
next it was hard to contour my face and

316
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,380
once she was doing it I couldn't help

317
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,520
but wonder what she was using because I

318
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,050
had never seen it before

319
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,910
it was there blotting powder in the

320
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:08,350
darkest shade when I asked she told me

321
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,670
was because it was a cool tone shade

322
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,320
which really obviously helps to sculpt

323
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:13,210
the face but it doesn't really have that

324
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,010
much covered so it allows for a really

325
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,960
really light and blended out contour

326
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,460
that looks almost natural and girl when

327
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,810
she told me that I was so shocked

328
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,490
because I did such a good idea

329
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,710
and as you can see it this contour looks

330
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:25,420
amazing she then used that same a dark

331
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,950
blotting powder to contour my nose which

332
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,690
I was so excited about obviously in the

333
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:30,190
last video my nose looked a little bit

334
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:32,200
big because I did not ask her to be

335
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:33,400
contoured but when I asked this time she

336
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,830
was very very happy too can we I

337
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,210
snatched nose looking at in the mirror I

338
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,500
do wish she would have pulled the lines

339
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,210
a little bit closer together to make it

340
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,160
more and more snatched appearance but

341
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,810
that's totally personal preference and

342
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,430
when she was highlighting she did use

343
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:47,770
that tiny pencil brush like I always do

344
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:48,790
to draw a very very thin lie I know the

345
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:51,910
highlighter looks a little bit bigger

346
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:53,470
now but that's a sweat and oil Mountain

347
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:55,780
highlighter I promised it looked really

348
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,640
good at the time once the contour was

349
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,560
all on and nice and slayed she went into

350
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,960
the blush and for today's look she's the

351
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,910
Mac blush in the shade peaches and I was

352
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,800
literally so so excited to see her pull

353
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:07,270
it out I said not asked for I did not

354
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,860
request it but as many of you guys know

355
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,720
that is literally my favorite blush and

356
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,090
the only blush that I ever wear in my

357
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,860
looks it is such a beautiful warm tone

358
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:17,080
peachy orange shade that I absolutely

359
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,190
love and she was so shook and she told

360
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,600
me that it was one of her favorites as

361
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:22,750
well and I thought it paired perfectly

362
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,460
with this look so next came the glow and

363
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,800
she was the Mac highlighter in the shade

364
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,210
soft and gentle which made my heart so

365
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,280
so warm because that's actually the

366
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:32,140
first highlighter that I ever ever used

367
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,120
on myself I used to use that same eye

368
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,710
harder every single damn day for every

369
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,510
look that I ever did because I could not

370
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,950
afford to buy another one so it has a

371
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,720
very very special place in my heart and

372
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,890
it is still to this day one of my

373
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,630
all-time favorite highlighter shades

374
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,830
looking at my face in the mirror I will

375
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,480
say that she definitely stuck by the

376
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,550
name of the

377
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,139
later being soft and gentle it

378
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,639
definitely is a subtle like glowing from

379
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:52,019
within type of look and based on the

380
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:53,070
picture with Jacqueline you can

381
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,570
definitely see that her highlight is

382
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:56,399
blinding and you guys know I love a

383
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,570
blinding Harley as well so I will say

384
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,339
that I wished she applied a little bit

385
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,870
more highlighter last certainly not

386
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:02,940
least she went and did my lip study

387
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,899
using the matte burgundy lip liner and

388
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,000
then filled them and using the

389
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:07,470
carnivorous liquid lipstick looking at

390
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,940
my entire face I think that the lips are

391
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,560
probably my least favorite part of this

392
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,670
look today I do like the color that she

393
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,290
chose I feel as though it is a pretty

394
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,209
close match to that original picture

395
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,800
that Jacqueline wore but I'm not the

396
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:18,300
biggest fan of the shape before she went

397
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,279
started my lips I did tell her that I do

398
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,870
like my top lip a little bit over life

399
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,550
it is one of my favorite things to do my

400
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,630
makeup techniques especially because I

401
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,310
feel like my lips are a little bit

402
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:28,019
uneven so over lining them allows me to

403
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,820
get a really really even and perfect lip

404
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:31,440
shape but when she applied it I feel

405
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,089
like she actually underlined my lips a

406
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,740
little bit you can almost get a tiny

407
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:37,019
little border surrounding almost the

408
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,880
entire lips of where there is lips but

409
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:40,050
no actual makeup product which is

410
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,060
definitely not my favorite thing in the

411
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,680
entire world this is the finished look

412
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:46,649
and I honestly it was love how it turned

413
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,750
out I am so Chuck in a good way

414
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:50,910
that's for sure going into box today all

415
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,550
the employees were so so nice and my

416
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:55,829
artist like I said Helen was so kind so

417
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:57,630
sweet very very comforting and also

418
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:59,190
really really talented as you guys can

419
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,540
see she's only that she didn't working

420
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,880
it back for the last ten years which I

421
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,019
was so so impressed by and as you can

422
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,699
see her skill level and experience

423
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:07,440
definitely reflects back in the makeup

424
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:09,180
thinking about my full experience today

425
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,130
at Mac and looking at my makeup in the

426
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,899
mirror I would rate today's makeover a 9

427
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,100
out of 10 the only two things that

428
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,600
really docked points today like I

429
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,010
excited to be the setting partner I do

430
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,329
wish she applied a little bit more

431
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,920
essentially like around my smile lines

432
00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:22,350
under my eyes because I am definitely

433
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,630
getting a few creases and there and I do

434
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,949
feel a little bit oily and also the lips

435
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:27,810
I do wish you would have lined them a

436
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:29,550
little bit more to over line them or at

437
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,750
least even follow my natural lip line I

438
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,860
feel as though they are a little bit

439
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,959
underlying which isn't the most

440
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,920
flattering for my face but neither one

441
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:37,410
of these two things are deal-breakers

442
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,029
and this makeover was so successful in

443
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:40,079
my eyes at least alright guys and that

444
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:41,579

makeover do you love it do you hate it

448
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:48,630
and my opinion I think sister Helen

449
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:50,550
absolutely killed it she did such a good

450
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,959
