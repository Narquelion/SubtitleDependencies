weird a topic to discuss being that like

27
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,040

when it comes to relationship like

33
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,330
opposites are supposed to attract right

34
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,290
and I'm very gay so like if I'm in a

35
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,790
relationship with somebody I need

36
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,020
someone to like balance me out right so

37
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,869
that's why I always go for like very

38
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,390
masculine muscular type men and normally

39
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:28,770

00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:09,910
okay all relationship problems aside

60
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,530
that is not a true friend right there

61
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,930
you need to cut her out of her life

62
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:15,760
before you get him out of your life kind

63
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,470
of both off all we ride a cow Jenna

64
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,120
asked my crush will not notice that I

65
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,410
like him and I'm so obvious about it

66
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,180
what do I do

67
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,650
holy Jenna I will just be honest with

68
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,569
him and tell him that you like them

69
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:28,360
because honesty is key in a relationship

70
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:30,489
demo we asked no man likes me I would do

71
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,890
you help of that I'll let you know when

72
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:34,989
I find out golf sister Alfonso last I'm

73
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,870
gay and I like a guy I don't know a

74
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:39,040
sexuality what should I do

75
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,170
literally welcome to my world that

76
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,970
sounds like I asked the question as

77
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,580
someone who is Ella best many many times

78
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:47,349
in the past crushing on straight boys

79
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,720
are boys that like you do not know what

80
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:51,940
the tea is it's sometimes important to

81
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,230
ask but not on an offensive way because

82
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,760
sexuality obviously something that is

83
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,349
very very private and it's nobody's

84
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,390
business but their own unless they

85
00:02:56,349 --> 00:02:59,950
decide to share it so usually I think it

86
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:02,920
eventually comes out in a conversation

87
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,569
but I definitely do have one crazy story

88
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,370
that I think I want to share with you

89
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:07,329

90
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,010
picture for you so you can like really

91
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:11,319
relive the story with me so like there

92
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:13,690
is one social media boy that I will not

93
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:19,269
name for security purposes from the

94
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:20,560
south no like I message this person on

95
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:22,030

time

103
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,639

00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:41,139
the conversation he sent back a snap

107
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,180

00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:01,000
thought he was kidding around we kept

118
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,170
talking and this boy is close to my age

119
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,180
and he was like you're just so

120
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:06,639
successful like at our age of how do you

121
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,870

122
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,700

124
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,540

00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,910
every other little white boy from the

126
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,160
south so

127
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,450
I was like well if you want to be model

128
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,500
let's see what she got at this point I

129
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,330
was thinking he was still messing with

130
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,690
me but he started sending a bunch of

131
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:29,430
photos in his underwear and me being the

132
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:30,210
absolute supermodel that I am I didn't

133
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,500
ask for input

134
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:33,060
I started critiquing his photos that's

135
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,440
the OH your but luckily about in this

136
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,240

137
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,170
this one like get it together gal if you

138
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,730
want to be an underwear model

139
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,320
they kind of step your game up somehow

140
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,820
the conversation shifted to like his

141
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,040
body and Holly wanted to look better and

142
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,450
then like to relationships and asking if

143
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,970
I've ever been a relationship and then I

144
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,050
told him no what are you doing ignore

145
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,690
that and then whom I'll see got my

146
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:54,900
hookups which I've also all ended very

147
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:58,800
very poorly to them him saying oh I feel

148
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:01,020
like you'd give her very good if you

149
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,570
know where I'm going with that so I was

150
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:08,880
like yes I do but why are you asking and

151
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:10,830
he's like oh I would totally let you at

152
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,720
that point the realization that he was

153
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,730
in fact not kidding and was being dead

154
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,870
serious hit me like a bus going a

155
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:20,910
million miles per hour well he does that

156
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:23,700
has heard of this or he gets interesting

157
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:25,890
yeah so he started getting intense

158
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,990
artistry and started sending more photos

159
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:30,210
that weren't exactly appropriate if you

160
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,440
get what I'm putting on the table here

161
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,300
he was saying all this stuff and

162
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,860
flirting with me and he told me how he

163
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,780
like wants to fight a California I'm

164
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,760
like take me on a date and then like do

165
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:41,370
stuff at the end of the night and it to

166
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,600
this I was like as hot as you are and as

167
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,540
much as I am enjoying this conversation

168
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,460
I am NOT doing anything with you if you

169
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,919
have a girlfriend and you know what he

170
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:53,730
said to me I don't he literally said and

171
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,950
I quote she's a huge fan of you and if I

172
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:59,850
told her she would not even care

173
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:04,020
oh so she's a sister yeah apparently a

174
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:06,870
real true hardcore sister I need to take

175
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,130
a step with my pink drink this is

176
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,630
getting intense after viewing this

177
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:12,000
obviously I was like very very shocked

178
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:13,680
but I assumed because he said that his

179
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,169
girlfriend wouldn't care and like knows

180
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,730
that he's apparently not straight that

181
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:19,620
they were in some type of like open a

182
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:22,230
relationship type of situation so after

183
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,460
hearing that I was in it to win it

184
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,570
that's all happened at like 2:00 in the

185
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,279
morning as well so I'm sure you can

186
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,719
imagine like what was going on in

187
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:30,329
the brain at this week and things

188
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:32,939
started getting really really flirty or

189
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:36,539
really fast and also very very out of

190
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:38,009
hand and apparently yeah if a photo was

191
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:39,299
not a - was obviously a lot of details

192
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:41,369
to the story that I do not need to get

193
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:44,399
into but I will say that this very long

194
00:06:41,369 --> 00:06:50,039
and late night ended with him facetiming

195
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:52,259
me and doing his business after that

196
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:55,019
night fast-forward and he completely

197
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:56,759
ghosted me for two months straight

198
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:58,289
his girlfriend probably found out we're

199
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,599
getting in there so I sent him a really

200
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:02,219
really long message that basically said

201
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:04,679
if you do not want to talk anymore I

202
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:05,729
understand why I do not blame you I

203
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:07,889
don't want to come in between your

204
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:09,659
relationship and I do respect that but I

205
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:10,829
respect you as a person as well and I

206
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:12,659
generally had a really good time talking

207
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:14,129
to him he was super sweet the night we

208
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:15,059
talked sexual aid sin that is obviously

209
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:17,099
really really hard to do but then

210
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:18,659
clearly a sister was confused so I

211
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:19,829
basically said if you ever need to talk

212
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:21,209
to you about it but you know you can

213
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:22,289
trust and like that will give you good

214
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:25,139
advice as someone who's been there

215
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:27,479
before I got you and to that message he

216
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:30,719
literally sent back the Rudess reply of

217
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:32,129
Mansoul oh yeah very very salty what

218
00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:34,139
really got me good though and is the

219
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:35,849
kicker of this entire story is that it

220
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:38,369
was his birthday a few days ago happy

221
00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:40,379
birthday man no not happy birthday and

222
00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:41,429
he came up on my explorer page on

223
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:43,110
Instagram because I never actually

224
00:07:41,429 --> 00:07:44,849
followed him in the first place but I

225
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,589
saw a picture of him and his girlfriend

226
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:48,689
still happily together and I noticed

227
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:50,939
that he had unfollowed me on Instagram

228
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:52,289
and I was like oh this is rude but I had

229
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:53,939
sent him a happy birthday text which is

230
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:55,649
my second message to him over the entire

231
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:56,909
process of the thing he ignored it did

232
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:59,549
not reply and at that point I was like

233
00:07:56,909 --> 00:08:01,259
oh who at his game over you played with

234
00:07:59,549 --> 00:08:02,939
the wrong girl but I'll putting this

235
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:04,889
aside the situation is obviously been

236
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:06,029
like on my mind for the past several

237
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:08,669
months because they caught feelings for

238
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:09,899
him fast it's very clear yeah and I also

239
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:11,939
felt really really bad for the

240
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:14,309
girlfriend after all this went down

241
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:16,319
because clearly something was going on

242
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:19,079
and I thought she knew at this point so

243
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,809
I sent a sister a message on Instagram

244
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:23,249
asking her to FaceTime me ASAP because

245
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:25,229
it was digging at me and I really just

246
00:08:23,249 --> 00:08:26,789
wanted to tell her the truth tea

247
00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:28,169
basically I told her girlfriend the full

248
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:31,110
story for I let's start to finish in

249
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:33,149
full detail which was so incredibly hard

250
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,069
for me not only was I like super

251
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:36,330
incredibly embarrassed of what I had

252
00:08:35,069 --> 00:08:37,830
obviously done being

253
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:40,440
I had no idea that she did not know what

254
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:42,330
was going on clearly he lied you didn't

255
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,830
do anything but it definitely was

256
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,600
assault yeah hundred percent but also

257
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,560
just seeing her being so happy and what

258
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,140
she thought was a genuine relationship

259
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,790
it'll be coming crashing down like over

260
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,990
a FaceTime call was just way too much to

261
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,149
handle obviously she was very very

262
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,649
alarmed and overwhelmed and who wouldn't

263
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:56,790
be and I told her that if she had any

264
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:58,290
questions are needed to talk to me

265
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,670
throughout that day that she could

266
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,079
totally come to me I would be there for

267
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,420
her and she told me that she was going

268
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:05,160
to see him later on so she would

269
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,110
confront him about it not even 30

270
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,079
minutes later I started getting the most

271
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:12,060
gross disgusting text messages from the

272
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:13,980
boy who I have not talked to but I've

273
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,410
tried to reach out to several times in

274
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,160
the last two months I've ever seen in my

275
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,040
entire life

276
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,930
they contained racist slurs homophobic

277
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,070
slurs just literally everything you

278
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,390
could possibly imagine

279
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,010
he literally started calling me psycho

280
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,750
and mentally unstable claiming that I

281
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:29,310
made everything up yeah I'm sure you

282
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:32,880
imagine him something using a show as

283
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:34,410
nine-inch just wondering what was your

284
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,149
thought process thinking you'd make all

285
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:38,339
this up do you have a lawyer I literally

286
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:40,230
do not know that was my thing too like

287
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:41,790
why would I literally call somebody at

288
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,440
10 in the morning while I was doing my

289
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,750
makeup in the middle of like going to a

290
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,170
photo shoot just to say like hi I'm a

291
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:50,579
complete awful person and I got photos

292
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,380
from your boyfriend who you're in a

293
00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:54,480
happy relationship with and I'm now

294
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,589
calling you to admit that because I care

295
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,350
about you and don't think you'd like

296
00:09:55,589 --> 00:10:00,750
deserve that but apparently I'm lying

297
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:02,310
like Hello I did not tell the story

298
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,810
today to try to like expose the two

299
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,890
people I'm definitely not about that but

300
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,360
I think that this does have a really

301
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,350
good message behind it that a lot of

302
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,209
people tend to forget when they're in

303
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,770
relationships sexuality is obviously a

304
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:12,240
very very hard and uncomfortable topic

305
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,680
for a lot of people to deal with I'm

306
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,050
very lucky to have an amazing support

307
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,760
system in my family but for people like

308
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:19,350
this way that I'm talking about it

309
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,149
sometimes becomes a situation where

310
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,760
you're in the closet or you're in denial

311
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:25,380
and even though we had a really great

312
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,600
time on FaceTime that one night doing

313
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:30,510
all that stuff he turned his confusion

314
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,459
into literal targeted homophobia towards

315
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,720
me and exchange for helping him which

316
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:35,640
not only put me in a really horrible

317
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,959
situation his beautiful girlfriend who I

318
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,209
spoke to and that I can tell it's a

319
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,070
really really genuine and kind person is

320
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:42,959
there an absolutely tax relationship

321
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:45,390
that she has absolutely no idea about

322
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,279
and it's clearly delusional over and the

323
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:48,640
boy is gonna have to live with this in

324
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,440
the back of his mind for the rest of his

325
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,440
that not only did he cheat on his

326
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,300
girlfriend but he also like really

327
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,620
messed with me

328
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,570
yeah after hearing that I would also

329
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,980
like to add that although relationships

330
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,320
might seem perfect you have to put your

331
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:04,000
own well-being first because really she

332
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,440
didn't and ya didn't turn out too well

333
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,360
it's definitely very important to listen

334
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,620
to the people around you who care about

335
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,030
you and love you because they usually

336
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,920
have your best intentions in mind

337
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:14,740
absolutely I feel like that's really

338
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,610
just took me at 76 years to towel but

339
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:20,500
yeah do you have any crazy cross stories

340
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:22,210
