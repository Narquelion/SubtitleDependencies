00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,940
getting straight into playing this video

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,050
is when we're going to be very long son

13
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,360
John I want to take up any more of your

14
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,949
time on this intro it has been far too

15
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,750
long since I have like the silent kind

16
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:44,920
of just chatting with you guys so sooner

17
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,449
you're excited to sit down with them a

18
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,220
little bit of a chit chat with me a

19
00:00:46,449 --> 00:00:49,839
style video I asked you guys on Twitter

20
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,839
to send me a bunch of questions about

21
00:00:49,839 --> 00:00:54,220
like my life makeup whatever you wanted

22
00:00:52,839 --> 00:00:55,629
to know Under the Sun so today I thought

23
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,119
I wouldn't sit down and just talk to you

24
00:00:55,629 --> 00:01:00,790
guys I put together this brown winged

25
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:02,110
owl smokey situation and I decided to

26
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:04,059
pair it with this blue a periwinkle

27
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:05,799
custom lip color and honestly you really

28
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:07,030
really love how it turned out I also

29
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,040
brought back at the fake freckles which

30
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:11,200
I have not worn in a long paralytically

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,880
time and I forgot to put on a half of

32
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,950
this video so this is definitely a very

33
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,689
very weird type of situation for me to

34
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,150
be in I don't exactly feel like myself

35
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:20,979
but honestly I really really like

36
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,229
sitting down and talking to you guys so

37
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:24,700
if you want to just chill relax and hear

38
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:26,530
some questions being answered about me

39
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,179
and see how to create this definitely

40
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,789
strange and unique makeup look

41
00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:33,189
make sure you keep on watching oh hello

42
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:34,659
everybody I am currently a barefaced

43
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:37,869
well no I'm not because I'm putting out

44
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:39,909
a primer but the hair is shaved

45
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:41,950
I got a fade on the size thank God it

46
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:43,329
was looking a little manly before not

47
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,130
gonna lie right now I'm currently

48
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:47,350
rocking the pepper from American Horror

49
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,810
Story look but you know what we're just

50
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:52,539
gonna move on and probably put on a hat

51
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:54,100
as soon as humanly possible I feel like

52
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:55,450
it's been literally months inside like

53
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,520
it's not that I talked to you guys I've

54
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,810
been it so really busy with my move to

55
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,270
LA and just so many different things

56
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,920
going on and I've been really really

57
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,240
slacking on YouTube and kind of every

58
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,130
social media lately so I'm so excited

59
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,899
now that everything is like kind of

60
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:10,179
settled down a little bit and I am back

61
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:11,230
and ready to kill it I really wanted to

62
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:13,180
sit down today and do a little bit of

63
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:15,370
like a chip shot get ready with me a Q&A

64
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,780
style video it's been far too long since

65
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,819
I have like just talked to you guys and

66
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,650
nothing like a really really serious

67
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:22,390
in-depth tutorial so I really do miss

68
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,190
that a few days ago I had tweeted on my

69
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,010
Twitter I just want to focus on you guys

70
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,209
I'm communicating

71
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,099
um there because I really feel like I

72
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:30,379
don't talk to you guys enough and that

73
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:32,000
is something that I definitely want to

74
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:33,349
change so if you don't want me on

75
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,819

76
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:36,290

infalling when two people as well I

78
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:41,360

79
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:44,510
but hey it's never too late to be bad a

80
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,159

00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,670
spread hen is looking a little splotchy

84
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,799
I have an appointment later on this week

85
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,900
perfect in time for Coachella this

86
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:58,849
weekend I am so freaking excited and I

87
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,400
hope that I'll be seeing a ton of you

88
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:03,290
sisters there it'll be me and Laura and

89
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,079
hey-zeus and Victor all going together

90
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,849
it's gonna be such a good time so if you

91
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:10,069

92
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:12,170
honestly have no idea what I'm gonna be

93
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:13,459
wearing yet so i'm horrified but

94
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,260
hopefully i figure something out because

95
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:17,540
the last thing that everybody wants to

96
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,739
see is me naked trust me

97
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,030
earlier on Twitter when I was planning

98
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:21,109
on what I want to do for this video when

99
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,540
I decided I was going to leave a little

100
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:26,299
chitchat Q&A style video I'd tweet it

101
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:28,280
out asking for questions and stuff like

102
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:31,310
that you guys no need to talk about so

103
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,319
I'm going to be answering them as I do

104
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,180
my glam today the first question is from

105
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:37,220
Mac and she asked if you could do what

106
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,980
one Kardashian's makeup who would you

107
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:41,629
choose and why well I think I would have

108
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,639
to choose obviously a sister Kim just

109
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:45,290
because she is a living legend and I

110
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:48,319
have a personal bias to her because I

111
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:50,510
had the honor and blessing of meeting

112
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,310
her she was so frickin nice literally an

113
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,930
angel sent from above so I asked Lee

114
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:57,410
loved her and would love to have her up

115
00:03:53,930 --> 00:04:00,290
one day but maybe Lee after Mario dies

116
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:01,519
because that's his job and I do not want

117
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,169
to compete with a legend

118
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,730
Zoi house where do you think your life

119
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:07,160
would be if you never picked up a makeup

120
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,449
brush and not oh wow that's honestly

121
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,419
such a hard question because I genuinely

122
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:13,110
have no idea just a year ago I was not

123
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:15,150
even doing this and now I'm living in

124
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:17,459
Angeles with amazing friends and amazing

125
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,019
people and doing what I love and am able

126
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,519
to make a career out of it this all has

127
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,079
happened so quickly for me and I've

128
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,030
loved every single moment of it but I

129
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,250
probably would still be sitting in a

130
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:28,140
high school classroom learning every

131
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,490
single day chase asked what is your

132
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,350
skincare routine and how do you get rid

133
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:33,180
of weird spots and pimples on your face

134
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,410
that's a really good question chase and

135
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,770
that is a question that I get asked all

136
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:39,180
the time and unfortunately my answer for

137
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,040
you guys is literally just wash my face

138
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,560
in the shower I know that sounds like

139
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,070
complete but I swear to God I

140
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,450
do

141
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,650
literally no skincare what just

142
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,390
definitely gonna come to bite me in the

143
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,580
ass later on I definitely want to do

144
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:52,080
some like research into finding good

145
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,760
skin care products soon is just not

146
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,870
something that I've really like really

147
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,490
cared about in the past and I don't

148
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,830
really know why that it's either I used

149
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:01,530
to have very very very bad acne people

150
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:03,090
it's good when I was like in fifth sixth

151
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:05,280
and seventh grade but it kind of like

152
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,960
just went away and I really had to deal

153
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,520
with it it's weird too because with me

154
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,050
when I don't wear makeup for a few days

155
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,280
then I'll start to break out I'm

156
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,700
definitely not the person to ask when it

157
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,080
comes to skincare advice I'm so sorry

158
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,490
Brandon asks what is one thing you love

159
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,930
about your career and one thing that you

160
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,370
hope to do in the future

161
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,979
answering this while doing my nose

162
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,229
contours already it's killing me because

163
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:26,940

things you have to say that's definitely

185
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,430
by far my favorite part of my job as in

186
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,020
the future I really don't know what the

187
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:13,150
future holds I have a lot of ideas and

188
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,319
I would love to work on I'll see you

189
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,449
guys know that I love to sing so I

190
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,979
really want to do a more musical stuff

191
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:19,840
in the future but that's hard as well

192
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:21,280
because like producing and directing and

193
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,680
blah blah blah so I'm trying to work on

194
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,000
that as if I have nothing immediately

195
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,470
planned but the second I do have

196
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,509
something and you guys know it'll be the

197
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,680
first people to know so just keep your

198
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:31,539
eyes open but there's a lot of cool

199
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,830
stuff in the works coming soo that I

200
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:34,210
have the scenes for now I'm just gonna

201
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:37,300
focus on YouTube and seven just having a

202
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:40,210
good ass time Nicole said cereal then

203
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,449
milk or milk of M cereal well Nicole I

204
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:47,949
have news for you I don't drink milk so

205
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:49,210
cereal then more cereal dry as seer

206
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:51,550
house do you before doing a more

207
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,960
creative looks or more glam looks for me

208
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,009
the answer to this question is extremely

209
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,750
obvious but I think a lot of you guys

210
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:56,050
might think differently and that is for

211
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,050
sure

212
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:00,819
creative looks 150 percent honestly I

213
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,380
hate doing glam looks literally more

214
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:03,490
than anything in the entire world I

215
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,349
don't know why I feel like they're just

216
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,780
so boring we've all seen the same with

217
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:09,550
Ron Sophie I have 50 million times yet

218
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,050
here we are I've gotta do a

219
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:13,060
bronze smokey eye in about ten minutes

220
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:14,919
when I finish do brows creative

221
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,940
avant-garde out there makeup looks got

222
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:18,219
me to where I am today

223
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:20,229
they got me all my followers and they

224
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:22,389
are truly what I enjoy most about makeup

225
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:24,669
I love putting a ton of really crazy

226
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:26,349
stuff on my face it's like creating art

227
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:27,789
honestly but one thing that sucks about

228
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:29,650
them is that those books can take up to

229
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:31,120
like five six or even seven hours

230
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,009
depending on how complicated they really

231
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,199
are so it was much easier than Wiener do

232
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:36,940
back home when I was like still just

233
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,050
starting off now it's much harder for me

234
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,310
because I'm just so busy and I have

235
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,319
something on every single day it's

236
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:44,889
really hard to get five or six or seven

237
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:46,389
hours free but I really am trying to get

238
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:48,009
back into it I've been trying to set

239
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:49,900
aside some time recently and I've been

240
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:51,340
like panning a lot of things on

241
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,139
Pinterest and like saving a lot of

242
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,699
pictures for inspiration so definitely

243
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,930
keep your eyes peeled because I really

244
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:58,029
really want to get back into career

245
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:00,009
stuff soon but yeah I definitely prefer

246
00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:02,349
a creative makeup looks over going on it

247
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:04,590
any day of the week Nicole asked James

248
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:07,120
what is your opinion on

249
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:08,800
well Nicole if you couldn't tell about

250
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,350
my thirsty Instagram comments on their

251
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,540
pages almost every single day or my

252
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:15,990
tweet to them or my idioms to them

253
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:18,550
asking them to country the face I

254
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:22,060
haven't lovable for them and I'm very

255
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:25,440
very open to a brother-husbands style oh

256
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:27,370
my god this joke is already going down I

257
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,870
love the Dolans ones that I want them

258
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:30,040
both to punch me in the face and then

259
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,110
make out with me if that answers your

260
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,700
question

261
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:36,010
Haley asked attending VidCon you asked

262
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,470
question mark unfortunately no I will

263
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:40,150
not be attending VidCon this year I'm so

264
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:42,040
freaking sad because I really really did

265
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:44,050
want to go but I just found out a few

266
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,730
weeks ago after I had already booked my

267
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:47,740
tickets to VidCon that is the same

268
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,830
weekend as my graduation back in New

269
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:52,420
York across the country so unfortunately

270
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:54,430
I'll not be a bit calm but I'll be at

271
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:57,040
playlist live in Orlando in a a few

272
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:58,630
weeks I am so freaking excited so if you

273
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,980
are going to that I will be there

274
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,420
my meet-and-greet just kind of knows I

275
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:04,150
think I'm competing great number of 20

276
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,070

definitely check it out get some tickets

278
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,670
I can't wait to meet all of you sisters

279
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,020
I've asked how do you like living alone

280
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:13,150
in your new apartment and are you gonna

281
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:15,910
do it in a permit or soon it is very

282
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:17,920
weird and yes absolutely I have been

283
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:19,630
working for the past few weeks actually

284
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,010
on an apartment tour video I'm working

285
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:23,710
with a graphic designer to kind of make

286
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:25,480
like an HGTV style thing it's gonna be a

287
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,890
big production this sounds weird but I

288
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,450
promise when you see the apartment or

289
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:30,550
video you guys are going to be shocked

290
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:32,500
to the frickin core I do plan on doing a

291
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:34,660
either two or three part series of it

292
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,220
I'm not on a percent sure yet but it is

293
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,560
gonna be a big thing on my channel that

294
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,900
I'm very very excited for so please stay

295
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,850
tuned and one of those videos will be

296
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,770
like a Q&A on living alone and how I

297
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:47,230
like decorated it and how I handled the

298
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:47,560
boob so I'm not going to answer that for

299
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,330
right now

300
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,590
stay tuned it'll be coming within the

301
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,180
next few weeks but I'm like officially

302
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,580
done decorating and fully like

303
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,110
settled on and I'm gonna so pretty busy

304
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,970
lately and I was just traveling and now

305
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,200
I'm going to a hotel this weekend and I

306
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:01,540
just had a friend sing with me so

307
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,100
there's gonna walk going on I will be

308
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,390
done soon I promise

309
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,610
I want these videos to be like really

310
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:07,410
good so it just be patient they're

311
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,880
coming

312
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:11,089
Gio asked what is your favorite pool of

313
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,679
all time

314
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:13,969
whoo I feel like I should really say

315
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:16,099
something from like one of the scissors

316
00:10:13,969 --> 00:10:19,069
Apparel's hoodies but honestly it's

317
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:20,149
probably work smarter and not harder I

318
00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:21,769
think that's something that like I

319
00:10:20,149 --> 00:10:23,989
always apply it to my life and I feel

320
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:27,469
like it's a really really good quote to

321
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:28,879
like live by yeah that's kind of how

322
00:10:27,469 --> 00:10:30,289
like that's how I like to work every

323
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,729
single day and like make sure that I'm

324
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:34,249
doing the best I possibly can

325
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:37,129
work smarter not harder or it's not that

326
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:38,839
deep Victoria asks how do you cope with

327
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:40,069
all the negativity you receive I truly

328
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,169
admire you for sticking to career

329
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:44,089
instead of taking a break Thank You

330
00:10:42,169 --> 00:10:45,709
Victoria that really does mean a lot to

331
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:47,419
me I think it's something that you

332
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:48,799
really have to learn to deal with as a

333
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:51,529
social-media influencer and it's

334
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:54,649
something that is really like it's

335
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:57,619
really really hard to kind of like grasp

336
00:10:54,649 --> 00:11:00,289
the fact that when you do this job and

337
00:10:57,619 --> 00:11:01,729
you have this lifestyle

338
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:04,789
everybody's gonna be watching everything

339
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:07,009
that you do and I think that even now

340
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:09,079
today being where I am it's still

341
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:10,339
something for me that is really really

342
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:12,049
scary to think about and something that

343
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:14,179
I honestly don't even like wanna think

344
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:15,469
about at the end of the day if people

345
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:17,359
are talking about you and mentioning

346
00:11:15,469 --> 00:11:19,339
your name and wasting their time talking

347
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:21,799
about you not only is that free

348
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:23,449
publicity and free press but that means

349
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:24,799
that you're successful so when I see all

350
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,909
these negative tweets about me I just

351
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,649
try to keep in mind the fact that like

352
00:11:25,909 --> 00:11:29,479
okay these people are talking about me

353
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:31,669
and day in and day out because I have a

354
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:33,679
name for myself and because I've gotten

355
00:11:31,669 --> 00:11:35,509
myself to where I am today it's a really

356
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,189
like kind of twisted way to look at it

357
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:39,109
and it's kind of sad that I like it even

358
00:11:37,189 --> 00:11:41,629
has to be that way but that's the

359
00:11:39,109 --> 00:11:43,069
reality of the job that I have a very

360
00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:43,980
very thing before I am and I'm so

361
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,510
thankful that I have

362
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,340
you guys because if it was not for you

363
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:49,740
guys I definitely would have quit a very

364
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,510
very long time ago but I have so many

365
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,850
amazing sisters out there that are all

366
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:56,070
loving my work and loving the things

367
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:58,290
that I do and that is truly what keeps

368
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:59,700
me going the negativity that all social

369
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:01,950
media influencers get is definitely like

370
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,800
the number one downside to having this

371
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:06,900
job it honestly can make some days so

372
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,190
beyond miserable a lot of people will

373
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,630
seem to think that oh like your

374
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,770
social-media influencer you make all the

375
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,150
money in the world you have all these

376
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:13,500
friends and you get to do fun things and

377
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:15,060
well yeah some of that is sure I

378
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,470
definitely have a lot of friends and

379
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,300
gets do a lot of cool things and I

380
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:20,460
definitely am making a study and kama

381
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,440
817 which I am so thankful for I would

382
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:24,510
never take for granite money does not

383
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,010
buy happiness there's no amount of money

384
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,380
that anybody can in the bank account

385
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:29,910
that makes them happy take it from me as

386
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,160
someone who has a lot more money than

387
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:34,890
most seventeen year olds I definitely

388
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,390
still go to bed upset many nights out of

389
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:38,250
the week it's just something you have to

390
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,570
learn to cope with and that sucks to say

391
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,770
but you didn't have to think about the

392
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:42,210
positive and think about what you're

393
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:44,580
gonna do next to get through it and how

394
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:47,460
you gonna handle this situation yeah

395
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:49,110
Kristine asked how and why did you come

396
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,970
out well Christina came out of the

397
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:53,460
closet when I was 12 years old and the

398
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:56,280
way I came out is definitely a little

399
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:58,710
unique and different to say the least so

400
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,720
I plan on doing a story time video about

401
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:02,160
it eventually please stay tuned I

402
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,010
promise it will come out just right now

403
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,860
it's still a little bit too soon but the

404
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,930
second I turn 18 we can talk about it oh

405
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,460
that sounds weird I've been asked what

406
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,720
is your dream car by the way I love you

407
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:15,120
and I'm in love with my sweater from

408
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,850
sistas apparel ah thank you sister Ellen

409
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,590
I love you too girl my dream car that's

410
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:21,660
actually a really really hard question

411
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:25,230
up until recently I've never actually

412
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:28,260
been like a car person even still I'm

413
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:31,170
kind of not now that I live in downtown

414
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,610
in LA I don't actually have a car I then

415
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:34,320
rank everywhere because I have up my

416
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,210
credits from and you guys using at my

417
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,160
code shout out to all of you for that

418
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:39,960
but I'm actually thinking about buying a

419
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,850
car in this summer and I definitely I'm

420
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,069
looking at a lot of

421
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:45,230
options but I'm really leaning towards a

422
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:48,050
cheap they are really really cute and

423
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:49,250
they're not too expensive either well

424
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:52,430
apparently they're awful on gas mileage

425
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:54,199
so I generally have no idea but my dream

426
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,370
dream card is probably like a g-wagen

427
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:57,380
all those in the next few years I will

428
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:59,839
have a matte white g-wagen in my

429
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:03,199
driveway on my modern at California

430
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:06,860
mountain Homa but as of right now a

431
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:10,399
sister is dealing with her tubers Sarah

432
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:12,050
what is your go-to order at Chipotle my

433
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,430
order is exactly the same and at this

434
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:15,199
point all the workers at my local

435
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:17,569
Chipotle and know me so I don't know if

436
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:20,630
that's like cool or really really sad

437
00:14:17,569 --> 00:14:23,300
but either way my order is a burrito

438
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:25,579
bowl with white rice no beans chicken

439
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,889
and then a mild salsa lettuce cheese

440
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:33,529
guac yes I know it's extra and then

441
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:34,970
oh wait that's it then I was going to

442
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:37,100
sign up chip symbolic as well and a

443
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:40,220
fountain drink for the road and my total

444
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:42,649
is a 1589 sometimes they gave me the

445
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,910
sisters discount all right I'm gonna do

446
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:45,439
the other eye off-camera really quickly

447
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,389
then I'll be back and we can finish off

448
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:49,160
the rest of the face with more questions

449
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:50,149
I just want to take up anywhere every

450
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,220
time because I feel like this video is

451
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:55,250
already getting very very very long so

452
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,810
BRB so I just wanted to finish my eyes

453
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,670
off camera just to it save a little bit

454
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:00,470
of time so you continue on with the Q&A

455
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:02,269
I use the black liner for the upper

456
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:04,040
waterline and a nude liner for the lower

457
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:05,420
waterline of course I had a pop on my

458
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,220
house lashes like products for the

459
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,630
lashes today and I just bend them

460
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,120
together with the benefit roller lash

461
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:12,920
mascara eight and ass we're to get the

462
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,149
idea of calling your fans as sisters

463
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,439
this is actually one question that I get

464
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:17,000
asked all the time and I don't think

465
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:19,189
I've ever actually adjust it in a video

466
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,740
before so this is like a good time to

467
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:23,839
answer I guess I personally hate the

468
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:26,149
word like fans more than anything in the

469
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,550
world I think it is so incredibly tacky

470
00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:30,620
and ugly to call like followers and

471
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:32,029
supporters the fans who I just I don't

472
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,259
know why I just really don't like it

473
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:33,950
sisters are so started this past

474
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:35,630
Halloween

475
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:37,760
you guys do not see my Halloween costume

476
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:39,170
I was a little bit of like a dead deer

477
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,480
type of situation it was a very very

478
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:44,360
intricate costume but you guys know me I

479
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,190
always need my baseball hat on Laurens

480
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,110
dad basically helped me cut holes in a

481
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,490
leather hat but it was where so I could

482
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,960
put antlers Stuart's second where the

483
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,510
antlers and the hat at the same time

484
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,500
loading me being extra as helper and no

485
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,870
reason at all

486
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,950
but I was super super appreciative and

487
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,960
he literally pulled it together out of

488
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,820
nowhere so I was like damn super

489
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,560
impressed and when he handed me the hat

490
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:05,720
I don't know why but I just said thank

491
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,430
you sister Marco don't know where it

492
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,600
came from don't know like why it came

493
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:10,400
out my mouth because I had never like

494
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,540
said it before but and then I was just

495
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,330
thinking like what should I call my

496
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:15,560
followers because I adored fans then I

497
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:17,330
was like you know what I already called

498
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:20,000
my best friends which are basing with my

499
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:22,070
family sisters so why not call and you

500
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,600
guys sisters as well just because like I

501
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:25,820
like to look at you guys's kind of like

502
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,810
my family and close friends as well so

503
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:31,280
that's why you were all sisters Anne

504
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:33,170
Tolley said if you were going to go to

505
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,430
college what would you study this is a

506
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,780
great pressure that I actually get asked

507
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:38,120
all the time and it's honestly something

508
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:40,520
that I'm not really quite sure the

509
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,900
answer uh when I was applying to

510
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,180
colleges and looking at colleges I was

511
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,470
looking at different majors and

512
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,250
specifically like marketing and a social

513
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,660
media stuff

514
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,640
obviously I wanted to do something that

515
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,540
was going to be your focus towards so

516
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,520
that was gonna help me with my career

517
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,750
later on but obviously a lot of the

518
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,520
class I was looking at the different

519
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,290
schools it seemed very very like

520
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,420
outdated and just seemed like they

521
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:01,250
weren't gonna be very much help to me

522
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:03,020
basically however once who I asked about

523
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,880
like lessons that they had in their

524
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,230
social media marketing class and the

525
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,459
moment basically told me one of the main

526
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,199
things that they focus on is like

527
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:10,670
finding your target audience which yes

528
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,040
is a very important part of marketing

529
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:14,540
and she was like well one of the biggest

530
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,920
lessons we learned is how to find your

531
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,750
age group so basically if you're going

532
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,339
to be targeting older people you want to

533
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,480
go on Facebook and if you want to get

534
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:23,810
the young kids you're gonna want to go

535
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,550
on Instagram and I was like there's a

536
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:27,920
lesson on that and she's like yeah it's

537
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:29,000
a huge part of the program when I heard

538
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,380
that for the first time that is when I

539
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,970
knew that college definitely it was not

540
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,530
gonna be for me I definitely do not

541
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:34,910
claim to be an expo to anything I

542
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,990
believe there was always so much to

543
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,390
learn but I am definitely a very very

544
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:40,230
hands-on person taking a class on a

545
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:42,419
concept that I've literally known and

546
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:44,820
and then executing throughout my social

547
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:47,160
media career since like age 7 when I ran

548
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:49,980
a Club Penguin blog should not be a

549
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,690
lesson that I need to take in a college

550
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,370
setting where I'm paying several several

551
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,410
several several several thousand dollars

552
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:57,390
my parents money that they don't even

553
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,250
have in the first place so at that point

554
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:00,720
it was like a unanimous decision between

555
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,340
me my family that college definitely was

556
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,600
not gonna be for me and they were on

557
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,250
board and now I'm here in Los Angeles

558
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,110
and I'm learning more every single day

559
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,490
being like Anza and doing stuff like

560
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,440
that and marketing every single day with

561
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:11,910
my manager that I would ever learn in a

562
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,100
college classroom setting so I feel like

563
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:15,030
I definitely made it the right decision

564
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,350
definitely look into it and definitely

565
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,910
do a lot of good research before you

566
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:20,130
made the decision as well because I

567
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,960
believe education is a super SuperDuper

568
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,460
important I graduated high school a

569
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,620
super high average and I'm very very

570
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,690
proud of it but I definitely think it

571
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,610
was right for me and my family to not

572
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,320
continue on but definitely do some

573
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,390
research and decide what's best for your

574
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,890
situation for how later today I'm going

575
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,330
to pop on the Eclipse highlighter from a

576
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:38,370
jeffree star cosmetics this is in a

577
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:42,090
collaboration with many of you I I am

578
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:49,650
I'm so freaking oops I am oh my god oh

579
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:50,760
wow okay how are you doing today the for

580
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,740
the lips today I was originally planning

581
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,160
on this one from Anastasio which now

582
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,299
looking at it on the camera would look

583
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,429
really pretty so I really hope that I

584
00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:01,500
don't regret this but I'm gonna go to

585
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:03,480
the anasazi lip hell up today I'm going

586
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,820
to custom mix the color somebody mixing

587
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:08,370
the shades primary five which is blue

588
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:10,230
primary one which is white and then a

589
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:12,900
little bit of nine which is purple

590
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:14,220
speak' a periwinkle color this is the

591
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,470
combination of the three colors that I'm

592
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,820
gonna go for today I hope that I don't

593
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:20,270
regret this but I guess let's go ahead

594
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,270
and put on

595
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:27,820
ah okay I really like this color this

596
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,480
would have been a really good

597
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:32,680
alternative hello to finish off this

598
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,660
look of course I'm going to set my face

599
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:39,670
using my Urban Decay oil slick setting

600
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:41,800
spray and then use my pal I'm just going

601
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:44,170
to dry that setting spray into my face

602
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,400
to lock everything in place and to just

603
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:48,400
make everything kind of melt into the

604
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:50,650
skin and finally Zoe asked James could

605
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,710
